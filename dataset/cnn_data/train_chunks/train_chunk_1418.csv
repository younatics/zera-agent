"Transgender hip-hop artist accused of killing a London break dancer with an illegal buttocks injection name-dropped her way through testimony Friday, claiming that model Amber Rose was among the celebrities who had sought out her services. Padge-Victoria Windslowe testified in court that Rose, 31, started receiving injections from her before she became famous and continued until two days before the 2011 death of 20-year-old dancer Claudia Aderotimi. She said under cross-examination that rapper Kanye West dropped her off for one procedure when the two were dating and that she was supposed to perform a 'correction' on Nicki Minaj that never happened. Representatives for Rose and Minaj did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment. Naming names: Transgender hip-hop artist Padge-Victoria Windslowe (left) testified during her murder trial that model Amber Rose (right) went to her to get buttocks injections . Celebrity couple: Windslowe said under cross-examination that Kanye West (left) dropped Rose off for one butt-injection procedure when the two were dating. This file photo shows West and Rose at the 2009 MTV Video Music Award . Windslowe, 45, talked of the dizzying array of names, addresses, careers and identities she has assumed in the 20 years she admits doing underground cosmetic surgery on the side. Clients from rappers to strippers to fellow transgender women paid thousands of dollars to plump their posteriors, Windslowe said. 'Amber was like a walking billboard,' she said of Rose, who was raised in Philadelphia. 'She brought a lot of girls from VH1.' Asked by Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega why they would choose an unlicensed practitioner over an L.A. plastic surgeon, Windslowe said, 'I was the best, and I don't mean that to be cocky.' Her 'Black Madam' moniker, she said, came from many lucrative years running an escort service employing male, female and transgender sex workers. She kept half their take. 'It's set up like a friendly date, but I'm not naive about what goes on,' she said. 'They're doing something. It's not just escorting.' She said she pocketed 50 per cent of their income and made good money. But she stopped after her father died in 2003 because she 'didn't feel good about it anymore.' The names she used on bank cards and mail deliveries before and after Claudia Aderotimi's death included birth name Forrest Gordon, the more feminine Foreest Leona Gordon, and Foreest Leona Giordani. On trial: Windslowe (left), 45, has been charged with killing 20-year-old London dancer Claudia Aderotimi (right) Tragic death: Aderotimi died in 2011 after she was injected with low-grade silicone, which spread to the woman's lungs, liver and brain . Seedy side buisness: Windslowe said her nickname 'Black Madam' came from years spent running an escort service employing male, female and transgender sex workers . 'I thought it sounded like a movie star name, so I liked it,' she said of the last name. Windslowe is charged with third-degree murder. Aderotimi died after she was injected with low-grade silicone at Philadelphia airport hotel. Doctors have told jurors during the two-week trial that the syringe hit a vein and sent silicone to the woman's lungs, liver and brain. Two other women testified they spent months in the hospital with similar injuries after visits with Windslowe, including 23-year-old stripper Sherkeeia King, who received an injection on a dining room table at a 'pumping party' that sent her to the hospital vomiting blood. Defense lawyer David Rudenstein seemingly hoped to show jurors through Windslowe's testimony that she prepped them with alcohol before and after the injections and took other safety measures. However, prosecutors say she mostly used nonsterile, industrial silicone, not the medical-grade silicone that is encased in implants during standard cosmetic surgeries. 'I told [clients] I've been doing this for years, I've done it to myself and my friends, and I was trained by a nurse up in Washington Heights (in New York City) back in 1995,' Windslowe said Friday, explaining her credentials. 'Walking billboard': Windslowe testified that Amber Rose (left and right), 31, brought to her many female clients from VH1 to get buttocks injections . Big business: Although she was unlicensed, Windslowe charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested . On the stand Thursday, Windslowe said she was trained by a doctor in Thailand and another in South America who performed her sex-change operation. She said she started doing body sculpting two decades ago to help transgender friends. Transgender women often want to plump up an indent in the side of the buttocks they call 'the boy pocket,' she said. Windslowe charged about $1,000 to $2,000 per session depending on the amount of silicone requested. Some clients, including a pole dancer she discussed Friday, saw her a half-dozen times. Windslowe told jurors Thursday that she has worked on thousands of people, earning the title 'the Michelangelo of buttocks injections,' and uses the same products on herself.","Padge-Victoria Windslowe, 45, testified Friday that Kanye West once dropped off Rose for an injection when the two were dating .

"A New York City man was convicted Thursday of setting up the fatal shooting of his wife while the couple was on a walk with one of their young sons in New Jersey. A jury deliberated for  four hours before convicting Kashif Parvaiz of scheming with his girlfriend to kill his wife and make it look like a random attack. The August 2011 shooting occurred while Parvaiz and his wife, 27-year-old Nazish Noorani, walked with their son near her family's home in Boonton, a New Jersey suburb about 30 miles from New York that is home to a large Pakistani-American population. Guiltyu: Kashif Parvaiz is escorted out of a Morris County court in New Jersey after a jury found him guilty on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015 in Morristown, New Jersey of scheming with his girlfriend to kill his wife  27-year-old Nazish Noorani and make it look like a random attack . Forbidden love: Antoinette Stephen (left) pleaded guilty to murder and other offenses and testified against Parvaiz (right) The way they were: Parvaiz and his wife Nazish (left) had two sons and Parvaiz had his wife killed while with one of them on a walk near their New Jersey home . Noorani was killed, Parvaiz was wounded and the boy was unharmed. The couple's other son was with family members in the house. 'Nothing will ever restore Nazish to her family. As her two young children grow up, they will never have their mother by their side. Her family, and most especially her siblings, will never see her again,' Morris County Prosecutor Fredric Knapp said in a statement. 'This verdict, however, demonstrates to all of her loved ones that justice has been served.' Antoinette Stephen pleaded guilty to murder and other offenses and testified against Parvaiz. The Billerica, Massachusetts, resident was having an affair with Parvaiz and admitted firing the fatal shots. Parvaiz first told police that his family had been attacked by a group of men who called them terrorists and suggested that it was a bias crime, prosecutors said. Noorani was originally from Karachi, Pakistan. Stephen and Parvaiz exchanged text messages in the days leading up to the shooting, according to an arrest affidavit released by the Morris County Prosecutor's Office. 'You hang in there. Freedom is just around ur corner,' read one text sent from a phone listed to Stephen's father to Parvaiz, according to the affidavit. Black magic: Prosecutors said during the three-week trial that Parvaiz emailed two black magic companies asking if they could come up with a way to make his wife leave him, kill herself or disappear. They said he paid at least $4,500 for spells and prayers from the company . Loving family: Mrs Noorani with her two sons, aged five and three. The youngest witnessed the horror . Scene: Police remove the stroller from the area. The couple's youngest witnessed the shooting death of his mother as orchestrated by his father . Subsequent texts from Stephen's number describe driving around the neighborhood to see how far away the nearest police station was, according to the affidavit. The exchange of texts continued up until 2 p.m. on the day of the shooting, authorities said. According to Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi, Parvaiz's accounts of the attack were inconsistent and immediately raised suspicions. Parvaiz told investigators the couple was attacked by a different combination of black and white males who shouted ethnic slurs, authorities said. In his initial story, the group shouted something about the family being 'terrorists,' authorities said. Bianchi said investigators were deeply concerned when Parvaiz suggested it was a bias crime, but within hours 'it was obvious to investigators that this was sadly the alleged handy work of the victim's husband who allegedly did the unthinkable and plotted to murder his wife.' Nazish Noorani lived in fear of her abusive husband as their marriage crumbled and chillingly foretold of her fate to her brother.

The victim's sister, Lubna Choudhry, cried in the hallway in the arms of her brother, Kaleem Norrani, after the verdict was read. The family did not immediately comment. Prosecutors said during the three-week trial that Parvaiz emailed two black magic companies asking if they could come up with a way to make his wife leave him, kill herself or disappear. They said he paid at least $4,500 for spells and prayers from the company.

"The original Catwoman has officially been outed as bisexual - ending years of speculation by fans. Selina Kyle, Batman's stealthy enemy and love interest, officially came out as bisexual in the latest issue of DC Comics' Catwoman. The leather-clad cat burglar kissed another woman, confirming what many fans had long suspected about the flirtatious feline. Out: Catwoman, played here by Michelle Pfeiffe in Batman Returns, has been revealed as bisexual . Writer Genevieve Valentine, who took over the series in October, wrote on her blog that establishing Selina Kyle as 'canon bisexual' was something she had always intended. 'She's flirted around it — often quite literally — for years now,' wrote Valentine. 'For me, this wasn't a revelation so much as a confirmation.' Kyle, who has retired as Catwoman to become the head of a crime family in Gotham City, comes out the closet in a scene where she confronts a new character. Flirty feline: The leather-clad cat burglar kissed another woman, confirming what many fans had long suspected about the flirtatious feline, played here by Halle Berry in 2004 . Wild: Julie Newmar in the tv role of Catwoman is one of Gotham City's most prominent villains. She shares a kiss with another woman in the latest edition of the DC comic . 'Eiko' has taken over the Catwoman identity without Kyle's consent and the charged sequence ends with a kiss. Valentine wrote: 'Was it a surprise for them? In terms of their sexualities, not particularly; certainly it's no surprise to Selina that she has an attraction to a woman. 'Will they dramatically implode? I mean, it's comics, it could happen. But it will be a relationship. I'm excited to be here for it.' Catwoman's coming out is the latest of many efforts by comic book companies to diversify their characters. DC's Batwoman has identified as a lesbian since 2006, and Green Lantern, Alan Scott, was reintroduced as gay while X-Man's Northstar married his boyfriend in 2012.","Revelation ends years of speculation over Batman's love interest .

"Canada's Supreme Court has rejected a challenge by three immigrants to ditch its citizenship oath, which requires would-be citizens to pledge allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II . Canada's Supreme Court has rejected a challenge by three immigrants to ditch its citizenship oath, which requires would-be citizens to pledge allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II. The appeal was launched by longtime permanent residents Michael McAteer, Simone Topey and Dror Bar-Natan who wanted to become citizens without making the vow to the Queen and royal family. The trio cited different reasons for not wanting to take the vow, including religious objections. But Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear the challenge to the citizenship requirement leaving intact an earlier ruling by Ontario Court of Appeal. Mr McAteer, 81, said he was disappointed but not surprised after learning of the decision. 'It's been a long haul,' said McAteer, a staunch republican who came to Canada from Ireland 51 years ago. '(But) I feel the same: If the oath stands, then I won't take Canadian citizenship.' Topey, a Jamaican Rastafarian, said her religion forbids taking an oath to the Queen. 'I'm trying to become a citizen not a subject,' she outside court, according to Canadian TV news. Bar-Natan, an Israeli, argued that the oath represents entrenched privilege he opposes. The Supreme Court gave no reason for refusing to hear the case. Canada's Citizenship Act requires would-be citizens to swear to be 'faithful and bear true allegiance to Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, her heirs and successors.' Canada is a member of the British Commonwealth and the Queen is the country's honorary head of state. The federal government had argued that taking the oath has been around since Confederation. In its ruling last year, the Ontario Court of Appeal noted the Queen remains Canada's head of state, calling the oath a 'symbolic commitment to be governed as a democratic constitutional monarchy unless and until democratically changed.' The Queen is the honorary head of state in Canada, which is part of the Commonwealth. Pictured: The Queen and her husband Prince Philip, pictured following a church service in Jasper, Canada, in 2005 . Canada's Supreme Court refused to hear the challenge by the trio. Pictured: The Queen meeting well wishers in Edmonton, Canada, during her 2005 tour of the country . Lawyer Peter Rosenthal said the high court refusal to hear the case doesn't necessarily indicate an endorsement of the oath,  but simply means the justices did not feel the case was worthy of their attention. Australia, which is also part of the commonwealth, scrapped its similar pledge to the monarchy 20 years ago.","Three immigrants challenged Canada's citizenship oath at Supreme Court .

"A St Petersburg lesbian nightclub was raided by police yesterday after one of the owners kissed her girlfriend on a plane in front of an anti-LGBT politician in a selfie that went viral. Police raided Infinity nightclub following complaints that it was letting underage people through its doors and allowing the sale of illegal drugs, it was reported. The nightclub's general director and social media administrator have been questioned by officers. Loving protest: Instagram user Kseniya Infinity, left, kisses a friend on a flight in Russia, in a protest against anti-LGBT politician Vitaly Milonov sat in the row behind them . Success: The kissing selfies, posted by Kseniya Infinity on her Instagram account, has since gone viral . Anger: The selfies did not please Milonov, who hid behind his tablet, and later told a local newspaper that he would  'call the Cossacks' on the two women . Russian human rights lawyer Vitaly Cherkasov believes that the raid is directly linked to the plane selfie, which was posted online at the beginning of February, according to Globalvoicesonline.org. The picture was taken by 'Kseniya Infinity' on a plane travelling from Moscow to St Petersburg in front of Vitaly Milonov, a vehemently anti-gay politician. The loving protest infuriated the St. Petersburg city councilman, who later called the women 'animals' and threatened to 'call the Cossacks' on them. After the lesbian kissing selfie went viral on Instagram and Twitter, Milonov confirmed the incident to a local news website and threatened to find the women and have Cossacks 'whip and torch' them. 'This animal offended all the passengers on the plane with its extravagant, terrible, inhuman antics,' he said according to Zaks.ru, as reported by Buzzfeed. 'I can call the Cossacks … they're already on their way, with whips and torches. We will expel all the perverts from St. Petersburg.' The picture also infuriated an anti-homosexual campaign group called Moscow Isn't Sodom and Petersburg Isn't Gomorrah, who made claims that many of those who go to Infinity are minors and that the club permits the sale of illegal drugs. It posted a statement online two days after the picture was taken calling for its supporters to complain about the nightclub to the police. Speaking to a local paper, Milonov called the women's kissing 'extravagant, terrible, inhuman antics' and referred to Kseniya Infinity as 'this animal' The group drafted a complaint that could be forwarded on. It said: 'I have every reason to believe. that the promotional activities carried out at the lesbian club Infinity pose a serious threat to the physical and mental health of minors who manage to enter the establishment.' The group added: 'It was precisely this nightclub's staff who staged a provocation a few days ago. Before the eyes of everyone on board a flight from Moscow to St. Petersburg, they demonstrated their perverse inclinations, causing a scandal on the Internet.' Last year Milonov said Apple CEO Tim Cook 'should be banned' from entering Russia after he came out as gay for the first time. Milonov reportedly suggested that Cook could bring 'the Ebola virus, Aids or gonorrhoea', and wanted to ban him from Russia 'for life'. In the past he has also called Stephen Fry 'a sick person', during an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, during which he also likened homosexuality to beastiality. In December last year he staged a raid on a St Petersburg gay club where he entered the venue with riot police and arrested anyone under 18. Following last year's Eurovision Song Contest, which he branded a 'Europe-wide gay parade', Milonov tweeted that Russia should boycott the 'Sodom show'. Milonov co-sponsored Russia's controversial 'gay propaganda' law bans displays of 'non-traditional sexual behaviour' in public or in front of under-18s. The law allows the government to detain 'homosexual or sympathetic foreigners' for up to 14 days, after which they could face expulsion from the country.","St Petersburg lesbian nightclub called Infinity was raided by police .

"Not one to be outdone by its rivals, Google is reportedly working on a mobile payment service called Android Pay. A 'source close to the matter' told Ars Technica the firm will officially announce the service at its I/O developer conference later this year. It will create a way for companies to accept transactions through their apps without having to introduce their own individual payment services. A 'source close to the matter' said that Google's Android Pay will let companies add mobile payments option to apps. Users will then be able to upload credit card or debit card information, and it will let firms add tap-to-pay options in high-street stores. Android Pay is set to run alongside, and not replace, Google Wallet . Android Pay users will then be able to upload credit card or debit card information to a single secure location but use it to pay for items across apps. And customers will be able to use it to pay for in-app purchases, goods or services with a single tap. Elsewhere, the source said Google will also allow companies to use its Android Pay API to enable tap-to-pay options in physical stores using NFC readers, for example. Cards are linked to Google Wallet, and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using a phone’s contactless NFC chip . Google Wallet is a free mobile payment and digital wallet that securely stores a user’s credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and offers. Cards are linked to the  wallet, and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using contactless NFC chips. Developers can currently use this API to add 'Buy with Google' buttons to apps, which Android Pay would effectively supersede if it works as expected. The source told Ars journalist Megan Geuss that Android Pay will run alongside, and not replace, Google's current Wallet service. Google Wallet is a free mobile payment and digital wallet that securely stores a user's credit cards, debit cards, gift cards, loyalty cards and offers. Cards are linked to the  wallet, and payments can be made for online purchases and in shops using contactless NFC chips. Developers can currently use this API to add 'Buy with Google' buttons to apps, which Android Pay would effectively supersede if it works as expected. Earlier this week Google said it was teaming up with the mobile phone payment firm Softcard to ramp up its efforts to counter Apple Pay. Google said its Wallet would become a pre-installed 'tap to pay' app on Android smartphones sold in the US  by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon. The aim is 'to help more Android users get the benefits of tap and pay,' said Google Payments vice president Ariel Bardin. 'We're also acquiring some exciting technology and intellectual property from Softcard to make Google Wallet better.' A statement from Softcard - which was founded by the three carriers last year in a push for mobile payments - added the deal with Google would 'bring together leading technologies to advance mobile wallets.' Bryan Yeager, analyst at the research firm eMarketer, said the deal 'will help get Google Wallet in front of more potential users, but the mobile payments space in the US will continue to be competitive and fragmented for at least the next few years.' Apple has already launched its Pay service (pictured with boss Tim Cook) in the US, and Samsung recently bought LoopPay. The Korean firm is rumoured to be using LoopPay's technology to develop its own payment service. A similar Google rival could be announced at its I/O Developers conference later this year . Mr Yeager noted that Samsung's announcement last week that it was buying digital wallet firm LoopPay 'shows that deal activity doesn't necessarily equate to market consolidation.' LoopPay technology is compatible with approximately 90 percent of retail terminals to let customers tap their phones for payment with registered credit cards, according to Samsung. LoopPay has been built into smartphone cases as well as into fobs, or dongles, and transmits credit card data using magnetic fields to point-of-sale terminals to effectuate transactions.

"A woman and her husband have pleaded guilty to killing the woman's mother, who froze to death after they forced her to sleep in a shipping container in below-zero conditions. Jassy Anglin, 53, and her husband, 56-year-old mental health worker Michael Anglin, pleaded guilty in the Hobart Supreme Court on Friday to the manslaughter of Ms Anglin's mother, 77-year-old Janet Mackozdi in July 2010. Ms Mackozdi, who had the care requirements of a toddler, had been forced to sleep in a shipping container on the couple's property in Mount Lloyd, Tasmania, and died from hypothermia. Jassy Anglin (left) and her mental health worker husband Michael (right) pleaded guilty to manslaughter over the death of her elderly mother who they allegedly forced to live in a shipping container . The court heard forensic testing had revealed the elderly woman would have been trapped in conditions between -1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius. The couple, from Yorkey’s Knob, near Cairns, allegedly did not seal the container properly. In April last year, Cairns Magistrates Court was told the Anglins hatched an elaborate plot three hours after the pensioner died to wash and dress the body, then drive it to hospital in an attempt to hide the real cause of the elderly woman's death. Once there, they told a nurse the woman died after they had set off for a trip to a national park, it was reported by the Courier Mail. Ms Mackozdi, who had the care requirements of a toddler, had been forced to sleep in a shipping container on the couple's property in Mount Lloyd, Tasmania, and died from hypothermia . 'It's alleged both defendants concocted a story instead of calling an ambulance,' Magistrate Anthony Gett said. The Yorkeys Knob pair, who showed no emotion in court, were extradited to Tasmania to face the manslaughter charges. The couple had moved to Cairns four years ago for lifestyle reasons and not to avoid investigations into the death, their lawyer Jefferson Mobbs told the court.","A Queensland couple have plead guilty to manslaughter of a woman, 77 .

"Lies: Nicole Richess, pictured outside Bournemouth Crown Court today, falsely accused two Army soldiers of raping her on a night out in 2012 . A  woman who falsely accused two soldiers of attempting to rape her after having sex with them on a drunken night has admitted she made up claims of the attack. Nicole Richess was too ashamed to tell her boyfriend she had cheated on him with the two men so she lied and said they had forced themselves on her. The 20-year-old now faces jails after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice yesterday. The court heard that Richess had been on a night out with friends in Bournemouth, Dorset, in November 2012, when she bumped into a group of four soldiers. They went on a bar crawl with the servicemen, who were based locally at the time, and Richess invited the men back to her house, where she later had sex with two of them. Richess, who was 18 at the time, reported the soldiers after she told her boyfriend and he made her go to the police. The two men were then questioned by police and faced disciplinary action over the accusations. The soldiers said the claims had 'left them petrified' and had 'impacted their friends, family and their work'. Following two weeks of investigations, officers were satisfied Richess had made up the claims and she was arrested for perverting the course of justice on November 26 that year. Richess denied the offence and her trial was due to start at Bournemouth Crown Court yesterday. It has taken more than two years to come to court as Richess pleaded not guilty and the two soldiers, aged 23 and 24, and witnesses were serving overseas in the Army. But Richess, a former carer who has had to give up work for health reasons, changed her plea to guilty before the trial was due to start at Bournemouth Crown Court yesterday. A judge warned her that she now faces jail for her 'selfishness and lies'. Afterwards, the two soldiers told of the impact the false rape allegations have had on their lives and careers. They have already faced disciplinary action over what happened. The 24-year-old solider, who does not want to be identified, said: 'When the allegation was made I was petrified, I've never been so scared in all my life. 'It didn't just impact on us, it impacted on everyone we knew - friends, family, work. It could have been the end of my life. 'That stigma you have attached to you the whole time is horrible, it affects everything, like relationships. I'm glad it's over and hopefully she will get what she deserves.' The other man said: 'My family were distraught about the allegations and the worry has been the biggest thing for me. 'It's a big weight of my shoulders that it's done now. I'm just relieved and happy it's over.' Distraught: The two men who were falsely accused by Richess, pictured outside court today with their faces muzzed to protect their identities, said the claims had 'impacted everyone they knew' Prosecutor Sophie Stevens said in a statement yesterday: 'Attempting to rape someone is a very serious criminal offence. 'Nicole Richess made false allegations that two soldiers had attempted to rape her because she had been confronted by her boyfriend who had been made aware that she had been unfaithful. 'The investigation into her allegations revealed that she went out for the evening with girlfriends in Bournemouth. 'They went clubbing and she, with one of her friends, met four young men, army soldiers. Richess then took the two soldiers to her home where they had sexual intercourse. 'What she did not know is that her boyfriend of three years would be aware of what happened through rumours, as a result he confronted her. 'Scared she started to make up stories and after three days of being pressurised by her boyfriend she went to the police and said the soldiers had attempted to rape her. 'She maintained her story during the police investigation, which quickly revealed discrepancies in her statement. 'Her selfishness and lies had serious consequences professionally and personally on the two young men, who had to be disciplined according to the Army policy. 'The investigation went on their record and this limited their opportunities to be mobilised abroad. 'Their private lives had been exposed only because Richess could not take responsibility for her actions. We hope that with this conviction, they will be able to move on with their lives.' Isabelle Gillard, defending at Bournemouth Crown Court, said Richess was of good character and came from a respectable background. She said: 'At the time she was 18 and on the evening in question drink and drugs had been taken, in her case for the first time in terms of the drugs. 'The police investigated, the soldiers were traced and gave their account - that she had taken them back to her own home and had consensual sex with both of them. Convicted: Richess, a former carer who has had to give up work for health reasons, changed her plea to guilty before the trial was due to start at Bournemouth Crown Court, pictured, yesterday . 'They gave consistent accounts of what they said happened and the police came to the conclusion that what she said was not what happened and she was arrested. 'She is a girl of previous good character and she comes from a respectable background, she worked as a carer.' Richess had her sentencing adjourned for reports but Judge Jonathan Fuller QC said that an 'immediate custodial sentence would be at the forefront of his mind.' Afterwards Detective Constable Stef Belton, from Dorset Police, said: 'We spent a huge amount of time investigating the original rape allegation but it was clear very early on that there was another offence going on. 'The investigation has taken two years to come to court. The victims of this case have been waiting for that long to have their names cleared so I'm very pleased with the result in court today. 'We take allegations of rape very seriously and fully support genuine victims of rape. 'We also take any false allegation very seriously because there can be very serious consequences for the people that get arrested for those offences, particularly rape because rape has a stigma attached to it and it can ruin people's lives. 'People who make false allegations make it more difficult for true victims to come forward but they should be reassured that we fully support any victims of rape and will always investigate any allegations that are made to the police.' It has taken more than two years to come to court as Richess pleaded not guilty to the offences and the two victims and witnesses were serving away with the army. Richess will be sentenced for perverting the course of justice on March 26.","Nicole Richess was 18 when she met a group of soldiers on a night out .

"They are part-motor home, part-coach ... and all style. With 43 full-time drivers on NASCAR's elite Sprint Cup circuit and 36 races each season, it means lot of traveling across the country every year. So in order to avoid constantly checking in-and-out of confined, expensive hotel rooms, many of the drivers have invested in a 'home away from home' on wheels. They can also park them at the speedway. 'This is where you spend all your weekends,' Darrell Waltrip , a NASCAR Hall of Fame driver, told The Orlando Sentinel. The motor homes cost anywhere from $1.2 million to more than $2 million. Scroll down for video . Sleek: Many of the RV's are custom-built to tailor to the needs of the drivers and their families, who usually travel with them to competitions. here are 43 full-time NASCAR drivers and 36 races each season all over the country . 'It's our home away from home': NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Darren Waltrip is one of many race men scooping up elaborate motor homes. He has been using motor homes since the 1980s, and recalls the days when he would park in among the fans . Modern: The motor homes come equipped with state-of-the-art, luxury features, such as motel-style beds and temperature settings. The only problem can be the noise, since they are parked so close to the speedways where NASCAR stage their races . Impressive: The kitchens allow the drivers and their families to self-cater and not rely on restaurants while on the road, including elaborate fridges, freezes and other cooking appliances. Being able to cook eliminates having to rely on restaurants for the drivers and their families . Essentials: Even the bathrooms come with quality finishings, such as luxury showers with marble tiling and even a step. Some showers are a little more rudimentary than others, and like other motor homes are held up above the toilet . Comfortable: Usually the NASCAR stars hire a driver, who ferries the motor coaches around the country, or will captain the vehicle themselves. The drivers and their families are then able to fly ahead and meet the motor coach, rather than spend so much time on the road . Decadent: The RV's are built as 'homes away from home'. Seen here is an office-style study with a leather armchair. NASCAR drivers earn a salary of between $1 million to $20 million, not including endorsement deals . Relaxing: There are 36 races a season, meaning the driver's use the motor homes frequently, parking outside the speedways. A good couch is essential after a long day in a race car . State-of-the-art: The company that produces many of the motor homes, Featherlite Coaches, describes the finish as 'yacht-like'. They hail themselves the 'official NASCAR provider' when it comes to motor coaches . Classy: The RV's are built to be 'houses on wheels' and come complete with living rooms and even studies, like the one seen here . Luxury: The motor homes cost anywhere from $1.2 million to more than $2 million. Pre-owned vehicles start at around $200,000. Seen here is a smaller model, however fitted with the same luxury inclination, with white leather seats . Family-oriented: Older, pre-owned models sell for between $200,000 and $800,000. Seen here is a diner-style booth for meals and for sitting while traveling between races . Chauffeur: The NASCAR star's usually hire drivers to captain the vehicles so they can relax, fastening into comfortable chairs like these . Important: The motor homes are completely self-contained, built to be on the road for long periods. Some showers are less elaborate, like this one . Self-catered: The kitchens resemble those of a modest apartment, with finer details. This particular home has a Las Vegas-like hotel theme . Older, pre-owned models sell for between $200,000 and $800,000. A NASCAR driver, generally, earns a yearly salary between $1 million and  $20 million, not including endorsements. The motor homes are often custom-built to suit the requests of the driver's and their families, who usually travel with them, including features like baby rooms, plush carpeting and proper kitchens. 'During the season, I probably spend at least three days a week in my motor home,' NASCAR icon Richard Petty told The Sentinel. 'So it's not only my home away from home, it's my home.' Typically, the NASCAR drivers hire motor home drivers to ferry the RV's across the the country, while they fly ahead. A company called Fetherlite Coaches, which is based in Suffolk, Virginia, cater to many of the NASCAR drivers. On their website they describe the finishings of the motor coaches as 'yacht-like'. They can feature up to four sliding rooms. Veteran: Driver Richard Petty (left) has been living in motor homes since the 1980s, starting with a simple caravan-style, and now upgrades every few years. He is seen here in 2002 . At-home: The coaches are usually parked outside the speedways where the drivers will be racing, in what they call 'motor home row' Child-friendly: Bunk beds are fairly standard sleeping arrangements, outside the master suite, with many having at least three. Driver David Ragan (right) owns a similar motor coach to the one seen here, which he travels in with his family . Novelty: The motor homes usually provide for space for children to play than a hotel room. It's not unusual for adults to sleep in the bunks, too . Practical: The kitchens could easily be mistaken for something from a regular apartment, with stove, fridge, microwave, oven and sizable sink . Spacious: The larger-sized motor homes can cost up to $2 million, but eradicate expensive hotels and flights. The master suites are quite spacious . Amenities: The motor coaches can fit even a large family of five, although typically only feature one bathroom to share . Beautiful: The newer motor homes have plenty of space and stunning finishings. Seen here is a model-style sink in the bathroom .","'Motor coaches' are 'homes away from home' for NASCAR drivers .

"A series of advertising billboards using what appeared to be a mysterious foreign language and symbols  sparked terrorism fears after springing up in New Mexico. Residents were reported to have hurled obscenities at the workmen as they were putting up the signs along the interstate after mistaking them for Islamic State adverts. Much to the relief of locals they were later revealed to be the work of Los Angeles based artist Daniel Small and were said to be depictions of the Ten Commandments. Scroll down for video . A series of advertising billboards using what appeared to be a mysterious foreign language sparked terrorism fears. The billboards were installed along Interstate 10 in southern New Mexico by art organisation Los Angeles Nomadic Division . A total of 10 large posters were installed along Interstate 10 as part of the art series titled Pending Cipher for the Open Present. They feature a fictional language created using Cypriot Greek and a form of paleo Hebrew over stills from the 1923 film the Ten Commandments, according to hyperallergic.com. They are part of a wider moving art project created by Los Angeles Nomadic Division. Delivery driver Craig Melton reportedly described the signs as 'pretty weird,' according to Las Cruces Sun News. 'You never know, we're close to the border and you think that ISIS or some other subversives might be trying to get at us,' he was reported to have said. He claimed that as they were installed a group of locals surrounded the workmen 'shouting obscenities and claiming that the billboards were either Satanic or Islamic,' according to hyperallergic.com. The billboards were created by Los Angeles based artist Daniel Small and titled Pending Cipher for the Open Present . One local said: 'I thought terrorists were making their way into the city,' after spotting the signs . Another local said: 'I thought terrorists were making their way into the city.' Others complained of being in America and not understand the signs. 'Feel like I'm back in Afghanistan when I see it,' another said, according to gawker.com. 'How about putting up the ten commandments all over the US...' But Samantha Frank, territorial director of the Los Angeles Nomadic Division, a nonprofit organization that promotes public art exhibitions, told the Las Cruces Sun News that the billboards were part of a moving gallery of contemporary art. The entire Manifest Destiny Billboard Project is travelling between Jacksonville and Los Angeles . Another local, who saw the billboards, added: 'I feel like I'm back in Afghanistan when I see it' The LAND website states: 'The ten billboards depict text from the Decalogue Stone, believed by many as an attempt at writing the Ten Commandments, in a language derived from Cypriot Greek and ancient Hebrew. 'Small has added modern day proofreading marks to this pseudo-language, creating illusory hieroglyphs superimposed on images taken by the artist in Guadalupe, CA where DeMille demolished and buried the ersatz Egyptian city set used in film from 1923.' The entire Manifest Destiny Billboard Project is travelling between Jacksonville and Los Angeles. The organisation received a $50,000 grant to help fund the project, according to Las Cruces Sun News. They were also donated advertising space. It started in October last year and is set to finish in June.

"An series of images by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) has revealed the movement of glaciers in southern Alaska. They reveal how the majority of glaciers have rapidly retreated since the late 19th Century - although a small minority have advanced. The technique - known as repeat photography - helps scientists determine how much a region has changed over time. Slide the images below to see the changing appearance of Alaska's glaciers over time . Here the retreat of the Muir Inlet can be seen. On the left, a photograph taken on 13 August 1941 shows a glacier 0.43 miles (0.7km) thick, with large seracs - house-sized chunks of ice - on its face. By 11 August 2005, however, it has completely disappeared from view - seen on the right . By analysing the various photographic pairs, scientists can document the evolution of the Alaskan landscape, and see how it is responding to retreating glacier ice - with an interactive map also showing their locations. The balance of glaciers and the surrounding environment can drastically affect ecosystems. When glaciers retreat, as many have done since 1850, it can affect the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use. It can also affect animal and plans that depend on melt-water from glaciers, while in the longer term it can cause ocean levels to rise. The increasing rate at which glaciers are retreating is one indication of how global warming is already affecting the planet. One pair of images shows the west shoreline of Muir Inlet, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, in Alaska - and the changes that have taken place since 1892. One photograph, taken on 13 August 1941, shows a glacier 0.43 miles (0.7km) thick, with large seracs - house-sized chunks of ice - on its face. By 11 August 2005, however, the glacier has completely disappeared from, the same location, having retreated more than 31 miles (50km). In its place, abundant vegetation is located on the slopes in the photograph. Another pair of images show the retreat of the Reid Glacier between 10 June 1899 and 6 September 2003. The photograph from 1899 is taken towards the northwest and shows the 197-foot (60 metres) high terminus of the retreating glacier. By 104 years later, the glacier has retreated 1.9 miles (3km) and is barely visible in the same field of view. Again, vegetation becomes much more abundant as it retreats. The retreat of Reid Glacier between 10 June 1899 (left) and 6 September 2003 (right) is seen here. The glacier has retreated 1.9 miles (3km) and is barely visible, while more vegetation has begun to grow on the side of the hills . The images of the glaciers in southern Alaska (locations shown here) were compiled by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) This set of images shows the remarkable retreat of the McCarty Glacier between 30 July 1909 (left) and 11 August 2004 (right). The retreat of the glacier here took place over a distance of about 9.8 miles (15km) The first photograph on the left is of the Northwestern Glacier at some point between the mid-1920s and 1940s. A second photograph on the right, taken on 12 August 2005, shows how it has retreated more than 6.2 miles (10km) out of view . Another set of images show the stunning retreat of McCarty Glacier between 30 July 1909 and 11 August 2004. The retreat of the glacier here is about 9.8 miles (15km) In a pair of north looking photographs, taken looking west of Harris Bay, another dramatic retreat of ice can be seen. The first photograph is an undated winter to summer view from a postcard, likely from between the mid-1920s and the 1940s. A second photograph, taken on 12 August 2005, shows a startlingly different view of the same location. In the area, the Northwestern Glacier has retreated more than 6.2 miles (10km) out of view. The aptly named Toboggan Glacier, meanwhile, with a gentle slope running down into water, is seen retreating during 103 years between 20 August 1905 and 22 August 2008. The aptly named Toboggan Glacier is seen on the left on 20 August 1905. 103 years later on 22 August 2008, right, it has almost completely disappeared . One of the most dramatic pairs of images sees Pederson Glacier, pictured right in the mid-1920s to 1940s, replaced by vegetation including grasses and shrubs by 10 August 2005, seen on the right . Not all the glaciers have been on the retreat. Harvard Glacier is seen on the left on 1 July 1909, but by 3 September 2000 - right - it had advanced 0.78 miles (1.25km) One of the most dramatic pairs of images is the Pederson Glacier, seen rapidly from the mid-1920s and 1940s to 10 August 2005. In its place, most of the lake has filled with sediment, and now supports several varieties of grasses, shrubs and aquatic plants. But not all the glaciers have been on the retreat. One, Harvard Glacier, has advanced 0.78 miles (1.25km) between 1 July 1909 and 3 September 2000, seen in a pair of images. Overall, though, the images highlight how the changing climate is having a rapid effect on a variety of ecosystems – and not necessarily for the better.","Images have shown how many glaciers in southern Alaska have retreated since the late 18th Century .

"With the exception of Kim Kardashian, most women would be wary of letting their boyfriends or husbands serve as their personal stylists for the day - let alone a week - but that is exactly what one writer did. After learning that her boyfriend Luke Winkie disliked her favorite pair of black shorts, Kelsey Lawrence, 25, from Austin, Texas, was inspired to give him complete control of her closet, allowing him to dress her without any limitations for an entire work week. 'I thought I had red-blooded, heterosexual dudes mostly figured out as far as what they think girls look most attractive in because I’ve spent a few years as an observant young female,' she wrote in an essay for xoJane. 'I was curious to put this to the test. What would he pick out for me?' Scroll down for video . Total trust: Kelsey Lawrence (left), a writer from Austin, Texas, let her boyfriend Luke Winkie (right) dress her for an entire work week in whatever he thought she looked most attractive in . Monday: Kelsey, 25, was 'pleasantly surprised' by Luke's first outfit choice (pictured), which mixed color and prints . The rules were simple. Luke, who knew nothing about women's fashion, had to pick out Kelsey's outfits based solely on what he found her most attractive in. For his first day of styling his girlfriend, Luke chose an A-line, forest green skirt from Madewell, a loose, black H&M t-shirt and a leopard print cardigan from Goodwill. Black stockings and black ankle boots completed Kelsey's look. Kelsey noted that she was 'pleasantly surprised' that Luke was mixing colors and prints, and more importantly the outfit earned 'approving stares' at her suburban office. She even got a few compliments in the break room. The next day Luke dressed her in a stomach-baring, polka dot L.A. Gear shirt, a pair of grey and white tie dye Levi's and a denim jacket. While the eclectic ensemble made Kelsey embarrassed to go to work, her worries were unfounded. Tuesday: Kelsey said she was embarrassed to go to work in this stomach-baring outfit that Luke put together, but she later received a genuine compliment on her new look from one of her female co-workers . Wednesday:  Luke's next look was somewhat of a dud because Kelsey was wary of wearing these old boot cut jeans from Aéropostale . Not only did a co-worker love her pants, she went on to tell Kelsey that she noticed 'something new was going on' with her. 'I am simultaneously flattered and also now uncertain of anything I’ve worn ever,' Kelsey wrote. 'The outfits I’ve worn the past two days have garnered more compliments than any look I’ve put together for the last month.' For the third day of her experiment, Luke opted for a casual look, putting Kelsey in 'very old' old pair of bootcut Aéropostale jeans, his baggy New Order t-shirt and a  herringbone hooded coat. The entire look made her feel frumpy and 'mad unattractive', and she was shocked to learn that Luke wasn't a fan of the form-fitting leggings she usually wore. The following day, Luke stuck with some of Kelsey's favorite wardrobe items and dressed her in a black Stone Cold Steve Austin Christmas sweatshirt and her high-waisted black jeans from H&M. Kelsey explained that the playful outfit made her realize she hasn't been dressing like herself lately, noting that she has been 'very safe' when choosing her looks. Thursday: For day four, Luke picked out some of Kelsey's favorite wardrobe staples - a Stone cold Steve Austin Sweatshirt and high-waited jeans from H&M . Friday: On the last day of Kelsey's experiment, Luke dressed her in an eclectic outfit, which featured a football jersey, a fur coat and a shocking yellow miniskirt . For Luke's final day of styling, he paired a San Diego Chargers jersey with a tight yellow pencil mini skirt and a white rabbit fur coat that she recently purchased at a vintage boutique. The somewhat over the top outfit was worn to pick up gummy bears at a grocery store before she headed to Luke's apartment to hang out. 'My friend Andy told me I looked like an extra in a Cam’ron video,' she wrote. 'No higher compliment has been paid to me.' With the exception of the ill-fitting Aéropostale jeans, none of Luke's chosen outfits were even close to being failures. In fact, many of them earned some unexpected compliments. What's even more interesting is that Luke only spent a total of five minutes choosing Kelsey's outfits over the course of five days. The next time you're standing in front of your closet with 'nothing to wear', consider calling your boyfriend in for some help. Fresh faced: A year before Kelsey enlisted Luke to pick out her clothes, she dressed herself in a simple white t-shirt and form-fitting black pants . Personal style: She wore a white short-sleeved button down with grey shorts in 2013 .","Kelsey Lawrence, from Austin Texas, instructed her boyfriend Luke Winkie to dress her in what he found her most attractive in ."
"A consumer advocacy group has slammed new proposals to reduce online piracy as 'truly frightening', as its revealed they could expose Australian internet users to unlimited damages payout to Hollywood studios. Under the new Copyright Notice Scheme Industry Code, anyone with an internet connection could potentially face legal threats from Hollywood studios for illegally downloading movies, TV shows, and music. Consumer group Choice labelled the plan, which was compiled by Australia's largest internet service providers (ISP's) at the request of the federal government, as 'medieval' and said it 'reads like a horror movie script'. Scroll down for video . Consumer advocacy group Choice has slammed the Code as 'frightening' and is calling for amendments . The scheme could come into affect as soon as September this year. Under the proposed code, a three-strikes system would be introduced for illegal downloads. Customers suspected of illegally downloading content will be sent a series of notices from their ISP's - a warning, an 'education' notice, and a final notice. The breaches will be identified through technology which tracks activity on internet protocol addresses, and a notice will then be sent to the account holder to advise them of the suspected infringement. If offenders receive a a third warning, Internet Service Providers will be allowed to provide the customers details - a move that would allow the copyright holder to target the user directly. Choice campaign manager Erin Turner said that the new code could funnel average Australians into a frightening and confusing court battle. 'The code means that anyone with an internet connection could be under threat from legal action. Often consumers share with flatmates, partners, or family, which means that even those who don't download illegally could be taken to court,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia. The Communications Alliance, the industry body backing the proposed code, released a statement last week emphasising the 'public education' elements of the code, but noted that the scheme did provide a process of 'facilitated preliminary discovery'. 'Ultimately we’re trying to strike a balance. We’re trying to ensure privacy and that personal details are protected, that any allegation (of copyright infringement) will be independently reviewed, that customers don’t face sanctions,' John Stanton from the Communication Alliance  told news.com.au. The discovery process means that ISP's would be obligated to aid 'rights holders'- such a Hollywood studios- to locate and take legal action against those suspected of illegally downloading content. In Australia, piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones. Piracy levels hit a peak last year when 1.5 million people downloaded the season finale of Game of Thrones . Foxtel has exclusive rights to the fantasy series leading to criticism by consumer groups . 55% of Australians who downloaded content, including Breaking Bad spin-off Better Call Saul (above) illegally said it was because of a lack of access . While the statement also said that the code 'contains strong safeguards against any threat to the privacy of internet users' and that the consumer could appeal the final notice, Ms Turner said that Choice had serious concerns about the consequences for consumers. The ISP's- including Telstra, Optus, and iiNet- are obligated after the final warning to co-operate when rights holders wish to locate the consumer suspected of illegally downloading content. In a case earlier in February, the rights holders of the Oscar-winning film Dallas Buyer Club demanded that ISP iiNet hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie. The ISP expressed concerns the rights holder would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter, reported news.com.au. 'They can't oppose it, they have to participate when the rights holders want to take consumers to court. We are very worried about the lack of protection provided to everyday Australians, who could face huge fines that don't match the crime,' said Ms Turner. 'The code is an uncapped system of fines, which means that there is no limit to what someone could be made to pay under the scheme,' she said. Ms Turner said that 55% of those that downloaded illegally had tried to obtain content through legal sources . In Feburary, the rights holders of the Oscar-winning film Dallas Buyer Club (above) demanded that ISP iiNet hand over the contact information of customers who had illegally downloaded the movie . The ISP expressed concerns the rights holder of the Dallas Buyers Club (above) would send invoices to customers demanding they pay fines in the thousands of dollars to avoid going to court over the matter . Unlike in New Zealand, Australia has no limit to fines under the Copyright Act, and it is up to the judge's discretion as to what the consumer is fined. 'In the US, which also has an uncapped system, a consumer was sued by Sony BMG and fined $675,000 for downloading and uploading 30 songs,' said Ms Turner. 'This is why we are worried, this is a completely disproportionate system. We are not talking about a slap on the wrist, the punishment nowhere near fits the crime,' she said. The Communication Alliance maintains that while the scheme may not be a popular move with some customer, the industry body made genuine efforts to provide a reasonable balance between education and preventing further illegal downloading. Ms Turner said that while it was fantastic to see new streaming service such as Stan available in Australia, the country was still very behind the kind of access others around the world enjoyed . 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them,' said Ms Turner . The ISP's- including Telstra, Optus, and iiNet- are obligated after the final warning to co-operate when rights holders wish to locate the consumer suspected of illegally downloading content . 'I don’t expect there to be universal acclaim, but it’s a scheme that’s fair, that’s not punitive and that balances competing interests,' he said. Choice has been vocal about providing consumers with a greater range of legal options to download the content they are seeking so that they don't resort to illegal content. 'We did a survey last year which found that a third of Australians download illegally, and more watch the illegal content,' said Ms Turner. 'When we asked people the reason they downloaded, 55% said it was because of a lack of access, and that they had first tried to obtain the content through legal sources,' she said. 'Consumers find it very frustrating when they know the content is online, but that they are blocked from accessing it. It makes very little sense to them.'

"A 22-year-old customer with a newborn baby says she has been kicked out of a Sydney clothing store  for young women after being told by staff that they don't cater for mums. Tash O'Keefe says she was ridiculed  by shop assistants at Bardot's Macarthur Square store in Campbelltown, southwest Sydney, when she walked into the store with her daughter in a pram. She was allegedly browsing for a dress to wear for her baby's baptism when a shop assistant told her: 'This isn't a mums clothing store take your daughter and leave.' Tash O'Keefe says she was ridiculed by shop assistants at Bardot's Macarthur Square store in Campbelltown, southwest Sydney, when she walked into the store with her daughter in a pram. Ms O'Keefe was shopping for a dress to wear to her daughter Ella's (pictured) baptism . The 22-year-old customer was with a newborn baby when she was kicked out of Bardot, after being told by staff that they don't cater for mums . Ms O'Keefe, who often shops at the store, says she was shocked and appalled by the way she was treated. This prompted her to write a complaint on Bardot's Facebook page, demanding a formal apology from the female shop assistant. The incident has outraged other mothers, some going as far as saying that they will boycott the store. Friday afternoon's incident at Bardot was a traumatising experience for Ms O'Keefe, who says she was a regular customer before she became pregnant with Ella. 'When I went into the store my baby wasn't crying and I was being careful with my pram not to knock anything over so I see no reason for them to be so nasty to me,' Ms O'Keefe told Daily Mail Australia. 'But as soon as I walked into the store I could see the filthy looks the staff were giving each other, looking at me up and down and talking to each other about me.' Ms O'Keefe says she had actually picked a $200 dress she liked from the store, wanting to wear it to her daughter's baptism, when a tall blonde shop assistant told her: 'This isn't a mums clothing store take your daughter and leave.' Ms O'Keefe says she could hear other staff laughing while she was being ridiculed. 'There was no one else in the store beside the staff so no one was there to back me up,' she said. 'So I told the girl that she had no right to speak to me like that and that I actually wanted to buy a dress from the shop.' That's when Ms O'Keefe was further told by the staff member: 'It's okay we can afford to lose a customer as we have hundreds here everyday.' Ms O'Keefe, who often shops at the store, says she was shocked and appalled by the way she was treated . 'I was on the verge of tears but I didn't want to cry in front of my baby girl,' Ms O'Keefe said . Shocked and embarrassed by what she had just experienced, Ms O'Keefe rushed out of the store and didn't get the name of the shop assistant. 'I was just devastated and on the verge of tears but I didn't want to cry in front of my baby girl plus the rest of the shopping centre was quite busy,' Ms O'Keefe said. 'This has never happened to me before. But I can tell you now that this hasn't just happened at this store. All the other shops I walked into today, staff were rude to me.' Ms O'Keefe took to social media to lodge her complaint on Bardot's Facebook page later on Friday afternoon. 'I would like the girl to provide a formal apology,' she wrote. 'Please investigate this horrible behavior further. I have told all of my friends about my experience and they have to theirs and so on so forth. So you haven't just lost one shopper you've lost many.' Other mothers have been outraged by the incident, some saying that they will 'never shop in any Bardot shop again'. Another parent claimed she was in the same Campbelltown store and felt unwelcomed by staff. 'It's funny I should read this as the couple of times I've been Bardot Campbelltown pushing a pram, I've not had a very welcoming feeling either,' the mother wrote. 'After reading this I definitely won't be stepping foot in there again.' The Facebook complaint has since gained more than 2,830 likes, 614 comments and 524 shares. Bardot's Facebook page has also been flooded with comments from customers who were disgusted by what they read. Ms O'Keefe is yet to hear back from a Bardot spokesperson. 'I have no idea why mums are being targeted but it seems as though shop assistants these days need to know more about customer service,' she said. 'I think I at least deserve a formal apology from the shop assistant and I also want her to apologise to all the other mothers she has ridiculed.' Bardot, a franchise for women's clothing, has not responded to Daily Mail Australia's inquiries. The incident has outraged other mothers, some going as far as saying that they will boycott the store .

"A Scottish estate has been sold for the first time in nearly 500 years after being listed at £1.5million. Dollerie House in Crieff, Perthshire, has belonged to the Murray family since they took ownership of its grounds in the mid 16th century. It has been sold for the first time in 500 years to a private buyer after spending two years on the market. Among its unique features is a crooked bridge designed to ward off witches and evil spirits and a plaque dating back to the mid 1700s. Dollerie House in Crieff, Perthshire, has been sold for the first time in 500 years after spending two years on the market at £1.5million . The property is spread over an annexe with its own entrance, a south wing and separate cottage. It was owned by the same family since the mid 1600s until being bought in January . One of the eight bedrooms spread across the property's three wings. It is not known how much the house has sold for after being purchased by a private buyer . The main house is thought to have been built in 1780 to replace the original tower house which lay 100 yards north. It was demolished and used for storage thereafter. The newer building features a plaque, brought from the old house and dated 1741, which reads: 'In humane life thers nothing stedfast stands youth riches glorie fades deaths sure att hand'. The inscription is signed AM (Anthony Murray), with a Murray star. Five years later a son of the family was killed at the historic  battle of Culloden . Its most unique feature is a crooked bridge over a burn designed to thwart witches from approaching the house. At the time it was said supernatural spirits would not be able to make the crossing if they could not see the other side. The bridge bears a date stone of 1778 and has a heavily fortified gate which divides two parishes. In the house is a three-bedroom annexe with its own entrance, kitchen and living room. In the south wing are another three bedrooms, with two more sleeping quarters in the separate Dollerie Cottage. The property comes with stables and is set in 90 acres of parkland.

"An entire log cabin was reported missing in rural Oregon after the homeowner turned up after a year to find his backwoods lot was empty. Ronald Niederbrach called the Klamath County Sherrif's office on Tuesday to report that his 1,500 sq ft cabin - and its deck - had vanished into thin air. Police launched an investigation and by Thursday had discovered the wooden property half a mile away - and with a new owner who was allegedly sold the home by the former husband of Niederbrach's ex-girlfriend. Ronald Niederbrach called the Klamath County Sheriff's office on Tuesday to report that his 1,500 sq ft cabin - and its deck - had vanished into thin air. It was found, 48 hours later, on a different lot in Oregon (pictured) Police launched an investigation and by Thursday had discovered the wooden property half a mile away - and with a new owner who was allegedly sold the home by the former husband of Niederbrach's ex-girlfriend . What, at first, had been the mystery of the missing cabin was suddenly the mystery of who really owned the home - and a more complicated civil dispute. After talking to local residents, officers found the cabin 'in plain view', according to OregonLive. Niederbrach originally purchased land  and lived alongside  in a separate house  with his girlfriend, Paulette Kallo. After Paulette's ex-husband, Miklos Kallo, developed health problems, he moved onto the property so she could take care of him. It was Mr Kallo who built the log cabin and lived there. The Klamath Sheriff's office told Daily Mail Online all three individuals are still titled to the land. After Niederbrach and Paulette split up, he moved away. Miklos Kallo and his former wife then got back together and lived in the home she had formerly shared with Niederbrach. When that home caught on fire and became uninhabitable, the couple decided to move off the land. Last summer, Mr Kallo sold the cabin to a fourth person, who hired a logging company and transported the structure to where it stands now. It is not exactly known when Niederbrach heard his cabin  was missing, but when he called his ex-girlfriend, she claimed not to know anything. The sheriff's office were now trying to figure out who can lay claim to the cabin. They were also determining whether the case is even  criminal at all - or just a civil dispute. Detective Eric Shepherd described the whole incident as 'a mess' but said he believes the man who bought the cabin will be keeping it. 'The person who has the cabin now is completely legal,' Shepherd told Daily Mail Online. 'He did absolutely nothing wrong and did everything he was supposed to do.' Shepherd said although the purchase of the cabin was legal, the sale of the property might not have been. This is because, although Mr Kallo bought the log cabin kit that was used to build the house's exterior frame, Niederbrach claims he put a substantial amount of his own money into the house's development. 'There was a great deal of other money invested to make that a livable home,' Shepherd said. Shepherd said there may be some financial liability, but he doesn't believe it will change who ultimately gets the house. 'As far as who ends up with the cabin it won’t matter,' he said. 'It should be maintained by the person who purchased it.' But for now, the cabin remains in the Sheriff department's care. 'We have in our custody a home,' said Sheriff Frank Skrah at a press conference. 'I don’t know where we’re going to put it or where we’re going to book it, but we have a home.' Ronald Niederbrach originally purchased the land (pictured) and his former girlfriend Paulette Kallo's ex-husband built the cabin.

"With her floppy hat, designer boots and chic coat, Harper Beckham captured the hearts of parents everywhere on her way to New York Fashion Week recently. Yet some eagle-eyed mums and dads also spotted a business opportunity: with Victoria and David lookalikes forging lucrative careers mimicking the couple, surely the market was ripe for Harpers as well? Indeed, Susan Scott’s Lookalikes agency has 32 Harpers on its books, with a rush of approaches from new hopefuls. We picked our top ten Harpers — and here they are, as cute as buttons, looking just like the famous little fashionista. Spot the difference: The real Harper Beckham, left, and lookalike Emilia Robbins, from Wrexham, right . Mum can't tell them apart . Emilia Robins, three-and-a-half, lives in Wrexham, North Wales, with mum Gemma, 28, dad Simon, 35, who run a camper van building firm, and brother Mason, six. Gemma says: . When I show pictures of Harper to Emilia, she says ‘That’s me, Mummy. Who’s that strange man or woman holding me?’ That’s how uncanny the resemblance is, even she can’t tell her and Harper apart. And if someone were to put pictures of them side by side I think I would struggle to say who was who. Emilia attracts a lot of stares, which she likes because she’s a confident, friendly girl. I’ve heard the Beckham children are very polite and I’m proud to say Emilia has lovely manners, too. Emilia really is a little cracker. I’m not a pushy mother, so I will only put her up for things she wants to do, as long as I don’t have to pretend to be Victoria — I don’t think anyone would fall for that. Seeing double: Susan Scott’s Lookalikes agency has 32 Harpers on its books, including Annabel Wanner-Halder, left, and Phoebe Lowe, right . Modelling will pay for university . Annabel Wanner-Halder, three-and-a-half, lives in Beaconsfield, Bucks, with mum Jo, 40, dad Simon, 43, both IT consultants, and sister Amelia, two. Jo says: . My mum was the first to notice how much Annabel looks like Harper. Last year, we were on a flight to Madrid when the air stewardess touched me on the arm and said ‘Your daughter looks just like Harper Beckham.’ So a year ago, Mum sent her photograph to a lookalike agency and they signed her up. Any money Annabel earns will go into a savings account for university. I’m mystified how Annabel came by her looks: I’m more Geri Halliwell and Simon looks more like Griff Rhys Jones. It’s bizarre we should have produced almost identical daughters. Strangers stop us in the street . Phoebe Lowe, three, lives with mum Naomi, a nursery nurse, and brother Joshua, eight, in Worcester. Naomi says: . Ever since Phoebe was tiny, strangers have approached me in shops and parks to comment on her resemblance to Harper. I’d always act surprised. It was touching seeing Harper with her big brother because Joshua loves his little sister, too. It’s not just the long light-brown hair that makes Harper and Phoebe so alike, it’s their dark eyes, lips and the shape of their faces. So on a whim, I decided to send a picture to the agency a few days ago. I wish our daughters weren’t the only thing Victoria and I have in common: I’ve got a huge crush on David! Decoy: Bobbi Hutchins, left, lives near close to Harper's grandparents, and Sienna Gibbs-Cook, right . We live next to Harper’s granny . Bobbi Hutchins, three, lives near Hertford with stay-at-home mum Karlie, 30, and dad Paul, 31, a computer maintenance worker. She has a brother Paul, two, and sister Cameron, 11. Karlie says: . People used to say I looked like Posh Spice because I have long straight brown hair and a turned-up nose — so it’s no surprise Bobbi is a dead ringer for Harper. It’s a great honour — she’s gorgeous. I joked to my husband that Bobbi was being trained to be a decoy for Harper, because her grandparents — Victoria’s parents — live nearby. I’ve been to their house as a child, when they sold some furniture. They let us see their trophy room full of Victoria’s platinum CDs and David’s football trophies. I’d love to say her brother dotes on her the way the Beckham boys adore Harper, but they mostly squabble. She's made thousands of pounds . Sienna Gibbs-Cook, four, lives in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with Sophie Cook, 33, a stay-at-home mum, dad Lee Gibbs, 37, a printer, and sister Tahlia, ten. Sophie says: . When Sienna was two, I was shopping in Waitrose when I was asked by another customer if I was Harper Beckham’s nanny. She has appeared at several corporate events — usually with a David and Victoria lookalike — and in newspapers and magazines. We put all her earnings into a savings account which she can access when she is 18. There are several thousand pounds in it already. Of course, Sienna has no idea who Harper is, but she loves the little boots and coats she wears on photoshoots. She loves travelling on the train, too, so every time we go to an event it’s like a little holiday for her. We’re all very excited whenever she is in the paper — and, if I’m honest, she’s a bit spoilt. Like father, like daughter: Left, Amelia Bricknell's father looks like David Beckham, and right, Colby Brander-Stark dresses in sophisticated clothes like Harper . Daddy looks like Becks, too! Amelia Bricknell, three, lives in Grays, Essex, with stay-at-home mum Sarah Johnson, 31, and dad James Bricknell, 36, a printer. Sarah says: . My friend rang me last week and said: ‘I’ve realised why I always feel like I know Harper Beckham — she looks just like your Amelia!’ Amelia has always looked like Harper. When she was pictured in that black dress sitting on her dad’s knee, then at the airport being carried by big brother Brooklyn, the resemblance was uncanny. Some friends say James looks a bit like David! David and Victoria are good role models. A fashionista at the age of two . Colby Brander-Stark, two-and-a-half, lives in Radlett, Hertfordshire, with mum Hilary, 32, a Metropolitan Police controller, dad Michael, 32, a police officer, and brother Leo, five. Hilary says: . Colby is 12 months younger than Harper, so when I see photographs of her in the newspaper, I think ‘That’s what my daughter will look like next year.’ They even have the same Bugaboo buggy; black with a pink hood. Like Victoria, I like dressing my daughter in sophisticated clothes — shirts and leggings in black and grey, rather than Mickey Mouse tops. Friends are always texting and emailing me pictures of Harper and writing ‘Colby!’ in the subject line. I didn’t have any reservations about signing Colby up to a lookalikes agency because it’s not like saying ‘My daughter’s so pretty she should be a model’. Everyone wants their daughter to be a model, but not everybody’s child looks like a celebrity, it just so happens mine does. Ambitious: Sienna Maunsell, left, already likes to wear high heels while Violet Stringer, right, wants to be Rapunzel when she grows up . Already in high heels . Sienna Maunsell, three, lives with stay-at-home mum Jennifer, 28, dad Michael, 28, a printer, brother Keane, nine, and sister Emelia, one, in Manchester. Jennifer says: . I didn’t know who Harper Beckham was when a friend of my mum’s said she looked like Sienna. I’ve no idea who she gets her looks from as sadly neither my husband nor I look anything like the Beckhams. Michael likes to play football, but that’s the only similarity. Sienna is a little fahionista in the making. She likes wearing my high heels and even paints her nails. Pink is her favourite colour. It does get a bit messy. Like Harper, she is a bit of a Daddy’s girl and has Michael wrapped round her little finger. She’d rather be Rapunzel! Violet Stringer, three, lives in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, with mum Macey, 37, a handcrafter and dad Nick, 45, who runs outdoor markets. She has six siblings; Freddie, two, Savannah, 11, Harrison, 12, Alexander, 16, Rebecca, 14, and Jordan, 18. Macey says: . I sometimes see pictures in magazines of David and Harper and wonder what he’s doing holding my little girl. Like Harper, Violet has long hair — she wants to be Rapunzel when she grows up, and she loves dressing up. You’ll usually find her in a dress and wellies. I think it’s flattering she looks like Harper. Violet also loves her dummy, but I only let her have it in the car. Sian Stafford, three, enjoys her dummy just as much as Harper, but her mother plans on getting rid of it soon . Dummy double . Sian Stafford, three, lives in Romford, Essex, with full-time mum Marie, 29, dad Dean, 29, a roofer, sister Louise, nine, and brother Zack, 18 months. Marie says: . Physical resemblance is not the only thing Sian has in common with Harper — she also still has a dummy. I’ll get rid of it before she’s four because I’m worried about it damaging her teeth. I don’t suppose the Beckhams are concerned because they can afford the very best orthodontic treatment. I think David and Victoria are good role models because, despite their careers, they still manage to spend a lot of time with their children. And I joke to friends that having a daughter who looks like theirs is the next best thing to having the Beckhams’ fame and fortune.","Harper's floppy hat, designer boots and chic coat captured the hearts of parents everywhere on her way to New York Fashion Week .

"'How can you NOT see white and gold?' That was Nine Network presenter Leila McKinnon's fiery broadside at the smaller percentage of the population who, as far as they are concerned, believe this dress is blue and black. Some of the country's most well known figures have come out guns blazing about whether 'The Dress That Broke The Internet' is black and blue, white and gold or something else entirely. Network 10 personality and journalist Sarah Harris was equally passionate as her Channel Nine colleague. But the dress she saw was much darker. 'WITCHES! YOU'RE ALL WITCHES! #blueandblack,' she tweeted, aligning with the smaller proportion of the world's population who see darker shades. Scroll down for video .

"Five hundred women and girls living in England have been identified as victims of female genital mutilation in just one month, new figures show. And campaigners have warned the numbers represent 'just the tip of the iceberg', estimating more than 130,000 women and girls in the country are affected by the issue. Female genital mutilation (FGM), is a harmful traditional practice that involves the partial or total removal of the female genitalia. Campaigners told MailOnline today these figures will 'increase significantly' as more women access health care. Five hundred new cases of female genital mutilation were recorded in hospitals across England in January, new figures show, as a campaign group warns 'this is just the tip of the iceberg' (File picture posed by model) The statistics, published by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, include data from 126 eligible acute NHS trusts in England. They reveal 2,242 active cases, where women and girls are currently being treated for FGM, while 499 new cases were identified in January. From September last year to January this year, 2,603 new cases were reported nationally - 44 of which were in girls younger than 18. In April last year, hospitals across England were told to start recording all cases of FGM they identified. Mary Wandia, FGM programme manager at campaign group Equality Now, told MailOnline that FGM is 'child abuse and an extreme human rights violation'. 'Today's figures are just the tip of the iceberg,' she warned. 'We will see these figures increasing significantly as more women access healthcare. 'The figures also show that training of those who come in contact with girls at risk of FGM - and those affected by it - is urgently needed. 'Health, social and education professionals don't have clear pathways and don't always know what to do. 'FGM is child abuse, a human rights violation and an extreme human rights violation. 'We have made huge progress on ensuring a joined-up approach to preventing it in the UK. It is no longer in the shadows and has is clearly on the national agenda. Female genital mutilation is the practice in which some or all of the female genitals are removed, typically with a blade or a razor and sometimes without anaesthesia. This includes removing the clitoral and the fold of skin above it, and removing labia – the inner 'lips' of the vagina. In the most severe form, the inner and outer labia are removed and the opening of the vagina is closed with a small hole so the woman can pass urine and menstrual blood. Sometimes the vagina is then cut open for sex or childbirth. Women sometimes bleed to death or can be left with horrifying health effects, such as infections, chronic pain, cysts, infertility and problems giving birth. 'We just need to keep working to ensure that the law is properly implemented and that every single girl is protected.' Ms Wandia said training for medical professionals is 'essential' in helping them recognise those women and girls affected - as well as those at risk. She said: 'Survivors of FGM urgently need physical, emotional and psychological support.' Last year, Home Secretary Theresa May said that in the UK, 137,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM and a 60,000 are at risk. The figures she cited, from a report from City University London in collaboration with Equality Now, estimated that 10,000 girls aged under 15 who migrated to England and Wales are likely to have undergone FGM. In July, the Government launched a £1.4 million programme to tackle FGM, with the aim of ending the practice within a generation. This included bringing in laws to prosecute parents if they fail to prevent their daughters being cut. It also requires collecting data about FGM in hospitals in England and training both health professionals and police officers to respond appropriately to cases of FGM. Ms Wandia said: 'This is not an issue that can be ignored any longer. 'We also found that 60,000 girls born to mothers affected by FGM, lived in England and Wales in 2011. 'African countries like Kenya and Burkina Faso have led the way on ending FGM globally. 'We can end it within this generation but we need to continue to keep up the pressure to ensure governments are held accountable to their obligations.' Meanwhile the children's charity, the NSPCC, said since setting up FGM dedicated helpline in June 2013, they have received 521 calls from the public and professionals. Of those, 214 of the cases have been referred to the police and children's services. John Cameron, head of child protection operations at the NSPCC, said: 'FGM is a live public health issue and it is vital all health professionals are trained to spot the signs of FGM, and that girls who are subjected to this brutal practice get the post-traumatic support they deserve. 'We need to ensure doctors, midwives and other healthcare professionals are working effectively together with children’s services to support and protect FGM victims and their family members.' Last year, Home Secretary Theresa May said that in the UK, more than 100,000 women are living with the consequences of FGM and a 60,000 are at risk. In July, the Government launched a £1.4 million programme to tackle FGM, with the aim of ending the practice within a generation . The World Health Organisation recognise FGM as a 'violation of the human rights of girls and women'. 'It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women,' the agency said. 'The practice violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.' It is estimated that between 100 and 140 million girls and women around the world have undergone genital mutilation. Each year around three million women are thought to be at risk. FGM ranges from the partial or total removal of the clitoris, to the removal of the entire clitoris and the cutting of the labia minora. In it's most extreme form, all external genitalia is removed and the two sides of a woman or girl's vulva are stitched together. FGM is generally done without anaesthetic, and can have lifelong health consequences including chronic infection, severe pain during urination, menstruation, sexual intercourse, and childbirth and psychological trauma. FGM has been a crime in the UK for 30 years, but there have been no convictions for the practice. Last month the first trial took place in England. A jury took fewer than 25 minutes to acquit Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, of carrying out the potentially lethal procedure on a new mother. Another man, Hasan Mohamed, 41, was also cleared of abetting the offence. Anyone who is concerned or needs advice can call the NSPCC's FGM helpline on 0800 0283550 or email fgmhelp@nspcc.org.uk .","In January, 499 new cases of FGM were identified at hospitals in England .

"Doctors are baffled after an apparently healthy mother and her teenage son died from a mysterious illness just days apart. Zack Smith, 19, passed away at a hospital in St Peters, Missouri on Sunday and his mother, 48-year-old Rhona Smith, died on Thursday morning. The St. Charles County Health Department has met with infectious disease doctors since her death to figure out what led to their sudden decline in health, but relatives say physicians suggested the pair may have been suffering from a particularly virulent strain of the flu. Zack Smith went to St. Joseph's health Center on Friday after suffering flu-like symptoms and coughing up blood, according to a gofundme page set up for the family. Loss: Zack Smith, left, passed away after two days in hospital on Sunday, while his mother, Rhona Smith, pictured right, passed away early on Thursday morning after suffering similar symptoms . An hour later, relatives were told that his health was quickly deteriorating, KMOV reported. Over the next two days, doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia and a staph infection, and his organs began shutting down. He went into cardiac arrest and died on Sunday morning. According to the gofundme page, doctors told his family that it appeared he had a strand of the flu not prevented by a flu shot. 'They said the explanation of death was even more to the fact they felt it was a strand of the flu from Africa,' relative Scott Dyer told KMOV. His mother Rhona shared photos of her son to her Facebook page after news of his death. 'So completely destroyed inside and out,' she posted to her page on Sunday. 'My sweet precious son Zack lost the fight of his life this morning I am still at a loss of understanding how I walked in to the ER with him just 2 short days ago and now he is gone... 'I just want you back baby boy. I love you so so so much.' Heartbroken: Hours after her son's death - and just a few days before her own - Rhonda shared the tragic news to her Facebook page. She leaves behind three other children, aged 12, 16 and 21 . Questions: The St. Charles County Health Department has met with infectious disease doctors since the pair passed away to try to figure out what caused their health to deteriorate so rapidly . But on Wednesday, family took her to Barnes St. Peters Hospital after she felt hot and complained of a pain in her side. 'While we all thought she was just heart broken and depressed from losing her son we took her to the urgent care,' the gofundme page explains. 'They immediately referred us to the ER due to her blood sugar levels greatly above what their meter could read.' Doctors said that her blood sugar levels were so high that she was at risk of slipping into a diabetic coma, even though she did not have diabetes. Her health declined dramatically and she started experiencing problems breathing. Her heart stopped eight times and she was repeatedly revived, but after the eighth time, doctors were unable to find a pulse. She passed away less than 12 hours after being admitted. 'My sister went to heaven early this morning and is now resting peacefully with her son and mother,' Rhonda's sister Wanda wrote on Facebook on Thursday. 'I am extremely saddened by this. Having a very hard time coping with losing 2 close members of my family in less than 72hrs.' Doctors told family members to get tested for the flu and chest X-rays in case they have also contracted the virus. Shock: Relative Scott Dyer said doctors thought they were struck with a particularly virulent strain of the flu . Potent: There is still high flu activity across the U.S., as shown on this map released by the CDC. The Centers said more than 13,300 people have been hospitalized with the flu this season and 86 children have died . An autopsy is being carried out on Rhonda's body to find the cause of her death and the health department said they hope to know more once lab tests are completed. Rhonda leaves behind three more children, aged 12, 16 and 21. 'Any prayers sent our way would be more than appreciated,' relatives wrote on the gofundme page. 'We are all very frightened and hurting in this tragic time.' Flu activity has been elevated for 13 weeks across the country and has claimed the lives of as many as 86 children this season, according to the CDC. A total of 13,320 people have been hospitalized with confirmed cases of the flu since October 1, 2014, the CDC said in its latest report. The CDC added that, because the flu season started earlier that normal last year, it is likely to last longer than the average of 13 weeks.

"A caged tiger was given two live mice for a snack to cheer him up - only for the three animals to end up becoming friends. Sandokan the tiger became depressed after his life partner of 13 years died at their zoo in the city of Galati in eastern Romania. Zoo keepers brought Samira, a younger female tiger, to the cage, but the male tiger ignored her. This caged tiger (pictured) was given two live mice for a snack to cheer it up - only for the three animals to end up becoming friends . Sandokan the tiger became depressed after his life partner of 13 years died at the zoo they shared in the city of Galati in eastern Romania . Instead of eating the tiny mice, the tiger lets the tiny creatures wander around his cage - and even play in his fur . After racking their brains to come up with another solution, zoo staff decided the best thing would be to find him some alternative amusement. They released two mice into his cage - but rather than eating the tiny animals, he lets them wander around his cage and even play in his fur. Zoo spokesman Madalin Serban said: 'After his partner died last year we became very worried about Sandokan because he stopped eating and began gnawing at his own tail. 'It was very clear that he was mourning the loss. 'Other zoos tend to use medical treatments to cure animals of this sort of thing but that would have meant administering the drugs with a tranquilliser gun, which can be very traumatic for the animals. Head keeper Doru Ene said: 'It is certainly weird seeing mice in the cage with a tiger, but neither seems to have a problem with the other so why not?' Zoo staff say Sandokan is 'back to his old self' and has overcome the depression that set in after his life partner died . Staff had assumed that the male tiger would eat the mice once they were let lose in his cage . 'So we wanted to come up with a better solution and then we hit upon the idea of giving him a few live mice to play with, assuming that he would probably eat them. 'But instead he befriended them, making them into his new pals. Mice are great pets for humans as they are friendly and happily will interact but we didn't reckon a tiger would want them as a pet, but he did and now he is back to his old self. 'He happily lets the mice run around and play in his fur and the three live together just great.' Head keeper Doru Ene said: 'It is certainly weird seeing mice in the cage with a tiger, but neither seems to have a problem with the other so why not? I have however never seen anything like this and I was really surprised he didn't just eat the mice.'","Sandokan the tiger became depressed after his life partner of 13 years died .

"Madonna yesterday stumbled into fresh controversy by comparing today's France to Nazi Germany. Speaking out against anti-Semitism and racism in France, the singer described the situation as 'scary', claiming that the country had lost its tradition of welcoming foreigners and making them feel at home. During an interview, Madonna claimed that anti-Semitism was at a record level in France – where at least 90,000 Jews were rounded up and sent to the death camps during the Second World War. Scroll down for audio . Speaking out: Madonna told a French radio station that intolerance against Jews in Europe had reached 'an all-time high' She told a Paris radio station: 'We're living in crazy times. It feels like Nazi Germany. 'France was once a country that accepted people of colour, a place artists escaped to, whether it was [entertainer] Josephine Baker or [saxophonist] Charlie Parker. 'It was a country that embraced everyone and encouraged freedom in every way, shape or form of artistic expression of freedom. Now that's completely gone.' Fresh from the incident in which she fell on stage at the Brit Awards in London this week, the 56-year-old renewed her attack on France's far-Right National Front party, calling it 'fascist'. On the rise: Madonna hit out at the 'fascist' National Front Party. Party leader Marine Le Pen threatened to sue her over a video featuring Le Pen with a Swastika on her head . Madonna has previously criticised the party, which won 25 per cent of the vote at local and European elections last year. Renewing her stance – albeit getting the name of its leader Marine Le Pen incorrect – she yesterday spoke of 'receiving a lot of criticism and threats from Marie (sic) Le Pen'. The star's past attempts at political comment have caused controversy in France. In a backing video on stage during her 2012 tour, she displayed an image of Miss Le Pen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead. Miss Le Pen threatened to sue and the Nazi symbol, which Madonna had also displayed on stage in Israel, was removed to avoid court action. Floored: She scrunched her face in anticipation on the rough landing, when she realised that she was not going keep her balance . Grounded: The pop superstar was dragged to the ground as she attempted to undo her cape . Yesterday Madonna, who until recently was in a relationship with French dancer Brahim Zaibat, said: 'What I said two years ago is valid today. It's not just in France, it's all over Europe. But particularly in France. The level of intolerance... is scary.' Speaking after her fall on stage on Wednesday night, she said: 'I had a little bit of whiplash, I smacked the back of my head.'","Singer says France is no longer a country that 'embraced everyone'

"When Isabel Gratton heard her favourite play area could be built over for a housing estate she was determined to stop it happening. Despite being only nine, the schoolgirl went to a public meeting with other ‘Save the Green’ campaigners – and was so impressive she was chosen to make the key final speech to councillors. Not only did Isabel write the speech herself, but she moved the planning committee chairman to tears with her emotional and word perfect address. Moving words: Isabel Gratton, of Rotherham, helped fight off developers hoping to concrete over her favourite play area by reducing the planning boss to tears in a two-minute speech . Thanks in no little part to her efforts, Rotherham Council unanimously rejected the application to build 21 houses on the plot of land in the village of Thurcroft, South Yorkshire. Isabel, who lives a few yards from the green, said she was ‘really upset’ about the proposed scheme because the play area ‘means so much to me’. She was determined to do her bit, writing a letter of objection and then bravely speaking in front of around 100 people at the town hall. Jumping for joy: The bright young girl, pictured on The Crescent, in the village of Thurcroft, wrote the speech without any help from her parents . She said: ‘I think my speech made the difference because I saw the chairman crying. I think more children should speak about important issues. ‘I enjoyed speaking to these people and I would like to be a councillor when I grow up. ‘I was a bit nervous but I tried to speak loudly and clearly so everyone could hear me.’ Her father Paul Gratton, 41, a steelworks manager, said Isabel and his son Jacob, 13, played regularly on the green with their friends. ‘It is safe, it’s away from the road and there are benches so parents can keep an eye on younger children,’ he said. Reduced to tears: Planning Board chairman Councillor Alan Atkin, above, who has two daughters himself, cried after watching Isabelle deliver a speech in her bid to save the green . ‘When Isabel found out someone wanted to build houses there she said that wouldn’t be fair on the children and she decided to do her bit. ‘She wrote her own speech – her mum and I didn’t help her at all. It was a good effort by the campaigners but someone said afterwards that Isabel’s speech was the cherry on the top. ‘I think it’s amazing that she had the confidence to stand up in front of all those people.’ Popular play area: The green in the middle of the The Crescent in Rotherham will no longer be concreted over . Planning chairman Councillor Alan Atkin, who has two young daughters himself, said later: ‘I don’t mind admitting that I shed a few tears after Isabel spoke. ‘I am a bit of a big softie but it’s the first time I have ever been in tears at a planning meeting.’ Councillors received 49 letters of objection and a petition signed by more than 850 people. The green was owned by the National Coal Board before being acquired by developers. Victory for residents: Following the hearing the planning board made a unanimous decision to scrap the development plans, outlined in the sketch above .","Isabel Gratton, of Rotherham, joined the 'Save The Green' campaign .

"Nathan Walsh threatened to tell a married woman's husband about their affair and put naked pictures of her on the internet unless she gave him £1,000 . A 22-year-old man threatened to tell a married woman's husband about their one-night stand and put naked pictures of her on the internet unless she gave him more than £1,000. Nathan Walsh blackmailed his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, by text message for more than year, saying he would expose their affair unless she handed over the cash. The traumatised woman made more than a dozen payments before she eventually went to the police. Walsh, who fainted in the dock as he was sentenced, was jailed for three years. Walsh had sex with the woman after going for a drink with her in 2012 and kept explicit photographs of her, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. He started sending her text messages a few days later, telling the woman he would put the images on the internet and tell her husband if she didn't give him money. Prosecutor Timothy Harrington said the woman withdrew cash from her bank account amounting to about £1,100 and made a series of payments over 12 months before finally calling the police. He said: 'That was money she could ill afford. The payments in total appear to be about a dozen. 'She found it difficult to deal with this, as has her husband. She feels they have lost trust between each other.' Satvir Aujla, defending, said Walsh, who has no previous convictions, had been stupid, 'young and naive'. She said: 'He was too wrapped up with his own debt and the loss of his grandmother at that time.' The traumatised woman made more than a dozen payments before she eventually went to the police, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard . Walsh, from New Invention in the West Midlands, initially denied blackmail between July 2012 and September 2013 but pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial. He fainted in the dock as he was sentenced to three years in jail. Judge Martin Walsh said: 'This was a vicious and ugly offence and no doubt traumatised the complainant. 'This was an offence that persisted over a period of time with severe psychological trauma to the victim.'","Nathan Walsh blackmailed a married woman after having sex with her .

"A retired teacher died from massive internal injuries after being crushed between two horses as she was getting ready for a hunt, an inquest heard. Mother-of-two Rosemary Turnbull, from Marden, Kent, suffered multiple injuries to her chest and heart as she led the animals ahead of a hunting pack in November last year. A coroner heard the horses often became 'spooked' by the dogs and may have tried to escape from the 62-year-old.

"Myuran Sukumaran has been awarded his associate degree in Fine Arts, a cause for joy in his darkest days on death row. Sukumaran's mentor and friend, Archibald prize winner Ben Quilty, announced news of the degree from Curtin University on Friday. The news comes as Sukumaran and Chan await transfer from Kerobokan to the prison island of Nusakambangan, where they are set to face the firing squad. Australian drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran has been awarded his associate degree in fine arts . Sukumaran is a passionate artist, and he has been a leader in the Kerobokan jail art studio, where he offers classes to teach inmates skills for life after jail . 'I am one immensely proud friend,' Quilty tweeted. The celebrated artist has been mentoring Sukumaran since 2012, and has become his confidant over the regular visits to Kerobokan jail. Sukumaran is a passionate artist, and he has been a leader in the Kerobokan jail art studio, where he offers classes to teach inmates skills for life after jail in a supportive, drug-free environment. The community that has grown around the art classes is devastated at the looming execution of 'Master Myu,' and his fellow mentor, Australian Andrew Chan. Part of that community is a cohort of Norwegian students who have a campus in Bali and collaborate with Sukumaran on art and philosophy classes.

To be held at Kuta's Hard Rock Cafe on March 7, it will also auction some of the student's paintings, with the proceeds sent back into the classes. Prison authorities wish them to continue into the future and the project has also drawn the interest of researchers who want to replicate it in other Indonesian prisons. Zahlsen says Sukumaran's classes are so successful because he leads by example - displaying a special talent and a humility. Past art auctions have raised thousands for the classes, but this one will be bittersweet for the Norwegian academic.

"It appears that Conan O'Brien was able to pull off one of the greatest celebrity pranks of all time yet never shared the details of his awesome feat - until now. The popular talk show host revealed that while attending Harvard University in the 1980s he managed to convince Bill Cosby that he had received a lifetime achievement award from the prestigious Ivy league institution. What's more, Cosby then flew to Harvard and showed up in a tuxedo, at which point O'Brien presented him with an old bowling trophy. Scroll down for video . Conan O'Brien (left) revealed that he pranked Bill Cosby (right) into believing he had won an award from Harvard University in the 1980s . O'Brien was a student at the time and worked at the Harvard Lampoon when he told Cosby he won the Lifetime Achievement in Comedy award, which he showed up to accept in a tuxedo (above) O'Brien shared this story as he appeared on The Howard Stern Show. 'I honestly wanted to meet him,' explained O'Brien. 'I think it came from a good place.' Making the entire experience even more hysterical is that Cosby arrived at the airport in a private plane already wearing his tuxedo, and O'Brien picked him up in his parents' dirty station wagon. 'He walks out, and I’m like, ""Mr. Cosby! Hey!""' O’Brien told the popular radio host. 'And he’s looking past me for the stretch limo — and there’s no stretch limo. So I opened the door and went, ""'It’s in here, c’mon!""' O'Brien then said at one point Cosby even held up the wrapper of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese. Then, Cosby arrived at the school where he accepted what he believed to be the Lifetime Achievement in Comedy award, presented by the popular Harvard Lampoon, looking thrilled to be there. 'He comes out, and that’s when I saw what a master he is,' said O'Brien. 'I saw this guy not really do material, he just went out. But in that Bill Cosby way, he’s got the rhythm.' This as women continue to come forward claiming they were raped and sexually assaulted by Cosby over the years. Despite all of this though, Cosby told fans in a recent letter after being forced to cancel numerous shows over the uproar; 'I'm far from finished.' He also said in the letter, which thanked the Heymann Performing Arts Center for not cancelling his show set for Friday; 'I can't wait to see your smiling faces and warm your hearts with a wonderful gift – LAUGHTER.'

"The two teenage girls gunned down by their retired cop rather were mourned on Friday, as tears were shed over their 'caring and zany' personalities. Deanna Hochman, 13, her sister Alissa,17, were shot dead in their sleep by Glen Hochman, 52 - who then turned the gun on himself on Saturday. A service for the two girls was held in their hometown of Harrison, New York. Leading the mourning was their mother, Anamarie DiPietro-Hochman, 50, and their surviving sister, Samantha. Samantha said in a letter to her sisters; 'This tragedy has broken me. I will never be the same. I will stay strong for mom, reminding her every day that we have two of the most beautiful angels watching over us.' Mourners: Black-clad coffin bearers carried the bodies of Deanna Hockman, 13, and Alissa Hockman, 17, through the streets of Harrison, New York on Friday . Salute:Surviving sister Samantha and mother Anamarie  read heartbreaking letters . Dead: Glen Hochman, 52, a police officer of 22 years who only retired in January, shot dead Deanna Hochman, 13 (center) and Alissa Hochman, 17, on Saturday afternoon . Tears: In the above frame, mourners comfort a grieving relative of the slain girls at the funeral on Friday . She also said to her younger sister; 'As an older sister I hope that you idolized me, but the truth is, I idolized you. You were the funniest person I've ever known. You had the ability to make me laugh at any given moment.' She closed by saying; 'Keep an eye on each other and give pop pop a kiss. I love you.' Tears were shed for the two girls as it emerged that Hochman had left a 'final insult' before killing half his family - by allegedly writing the survivors out of his retirement plan. Sources told the New York Post that Hochman deliberately filed paperwork that did not name them as his beneficiaries - effectively condemning them to a future of poverty. At the service in Harrison, extended family read prepared from Samantha and her mother, who were too grief-stricken to speak. According to CBS2, all mention of their father was deliberately avoided in the service. Of Alissa, who volunteered regularly, DiPietro-Hochman said: 'I now see the reason you gave so much.' According to the Lower Hudson Journal News, she continued: 'Your smile could light up a room and your caring, empathetic way won people over. 'You were the baloney in our sandwich and without you we're weren't complete'. Samantha, 18, said that she was angry at her sister's death at so young an age. Her statement said: 'I am angry that you won't get a chance to go to prom, spring break, graduation or college. I'm angry that you won't get the chance to get married and have children. I am angry that your beautiful life was cut short'. Hochman is pictured here with the girls' mother, Anamarie. She was reportedly considering a divorce . Killed: Alissa Hochman, 17, a senior at Harrison High School, and Deanna Hochman, 13, were found dead, along with their father, on Saturday afternoon . Of her youngest daughter, Deanna, she said: 'You had a zany personality to match mine. I love that we could look at each other from across the room and just crack each other up,...' 'I promise you one day that I will laugh again in remembering you. Rest in peace, baby girl. Love, Mommy.' Samantha added: 'You were the funniest person I've ever known... It sickens me to know I won't get a chance to see you grow, to see you date, to watch you go through high school'. The Journal News reported that the funeral was held at the Catholic church of St Gregory the Great in Harrison, and was attended by dozens of family members and bus-loads of the girls' classmates, the Harrison Daily Voice reported. Funeral plans for the girls' father are unclear. Of the alleged plan to leave the two survivors penniless, a family friend told the Post: '...He effectively stole the future away from the family he left behind.' Hochman, who served White Plains for 22 years, executed his daughters, Alissa, 17, and Deanna, 13, along with three family dogs at the family home on Saturday. Samantha and her mother weren't home at the time. DiPietro-Hochman had reportedly considering a divorce in the previous weeks. Harrison Police Chief Anthony Marraccini said officers visited the home after receiving reports of no answers at the door. Scene: Police arrived at this home at 1 Adelphi Avenue in the Westchester County village of Harrison on Saturday night to find Glen Hochman, 52, a former local cop, and his two teen daughters dead . Police dispatched to the scene made the grim discovery of the bodies and a six-page note penned by Hochman. Police have not said what was in the note. His body was found in the garage while those of Alissa and Deanna were found on 'the main level' of the house. White Plains Police Commissioner David Chong released a statement  and called the deaths 'an unfathomable tragedy'. Chong said the department were 'shocked and horrified by the news,' according to the Journal News. 'We can only pray for the family,' he said. 'Officer Hochman served this department and the city of White Plains with honor and integrity for over 22 years.' Last year, Hochman won the department's life-saving award for keeping an unresponsive man alive until paramedics arrived. He reportedly suffered an Achilles' injury in early May when he fell while helping a disabled motorist, reports. He had time off to recover according to his union lawyer, Warren Roth, who had known Hochman for more than 25 years. He said Hochman sought a disability retirement because of the injury - but had not been depressed over it as he was planning for retirement soon anyway . 'It's just devastating to a lot of people,' Roth said. 'He was always a quiet, reserved guy, nothing ever seemed to unsettle him. ... And he was wonderful with his daughters, a devoted father. That's the scary part. There was absolutely no seeing this coming.' In a statement on the Harrison school district's website, Superintendent of Schools Louis N. Wool said Alissa, a high school senior, and Deanna were 'both lost to incomprehensible tragedy.' He said the response of the district community to past tragedies has been inspiring and that he expects the students and staff will be no less resilient this time. 'In this awful moment, let us remember how proud we are of (the high school community), how much they have helped others and how much they will help others again,' Wool said.

"Gerardus Chapel was at the helm of a 5,000-tonne dredger when it ran into and sank a tiny British yacht, killing a sunbather on board . A Dutch seaman who was at the helm of a 5,000-tonne dredger when it ran into and sank a tiny British yacht, killing a sunbather and her collie dog on board, has walked free from court. Gerardus Chapel, 37, was the officer of the watch on the 320ft Shoreway vessel when it collided with the yacht six miles off the Suffolk coast. Bernie Ingram, a 57-year-old doctor's receptionist, was sunbathing on the deck of the yacht at the time of the crash and was flung into the galley, where she became trapped as the 30ft boat sank. She tragically drowned, despite wearing a life jacket, along with one of her collie dogs. Her husband Peter, who lived with his wife in Woodbridge, Suffolk, was trapped inside the cabin of the yacht, called Orca, but was able to break free. He had ducked below deck to go the toilet for no longer than a couple of minutes, leaving his wife at the back of the yacht. The second of the couple's two collie dogs managed to escape with Mr Ingram, 59. Mrs Ingram's body was recovered the day after the crash last June and Chapel was charged. Chapel was standing on the bridge of the Cypriot-registered dredger when it crashed as it headed out to sea, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

Tragic: Mr Ingram (pictured) said his wife would be 'sorely missed' Chapel had failed to keep a look out in an area where there were likely to be small vessels such as yachts, the court was told. The defence argued that both vessels had a duty to keep watch. Chapel admitted failing to discharge his duties properly as the officer of the watch and was yesterday given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months. He was also fined £6,000 and ordered to pay costs of £4,800. Sentencing, Judge John Devaux said: 'Chapel accepted responsibility, co-operated and pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity. 'However, his failure to keep a proper watch caused Mrs Ingram's death.' Outside court Mr Ingram, who is a Labour party advisor and former chief technology officer of telecoms regulator Ofcom, said: 'Nothing can bring back my wife Bernie. She's sorely missed by me and many other people. 'The defendant was found guilty of failing to do his duties properly and has been held to account and that it was the significant cause of the collision.' Simon May, from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said Chapel had 'failed to use all means at his disposal such as radar and a bridge look-out'.","Bernie Ingram was killed after 5,000-tonne dredger collided with her yacht .

"They are some of the largest creatures on the planet, swallowing tonnes of tiny fish and zooplankton in a single gulp. But it seems that despite their vast appetites, whales are unable to enjoy their food - they have lost the ability to taste sweet, bitter and the savoury taste known as umami. New genetic research on whales has discovered that these giant sea mammals lack the key bits of DNA needed to detect these tastes in food. Minke whales like the one above lack the ability to taste sweet, bitter and umami as do other whale species . Indeed, some whales are even unable to detect whether their food has gone off, say the researchers. Penguins lost three of the five basic vertebrate tastes—sweet, bitter and umami—more than 20 million years ago and never regained them, a recent study found. Researchers at the University of Michigan say the genes were lost after cold Antarctic temperatures interfered with taste perception. They say the findings suggest that as penguins are meat eaters, they may not be able to detect the flavour of the fish they consume as they lack the umami receptor genes. Compared with mammals, birds are thought to be poor tasters, due in part to the observations that they have fewer taste buds on their tongues and lack teeth for chewing food. Previous genetic studies showed that the sweet taste receptor gene is absent from the genomes of all birds examined to date. However, it appears that penguin's are particularly impoverished when it comes to taste. The researchers say it could explain why whales often die after eating inedible debris. Dr Takushi Kishida, a biologist at the wildlife research centre of Kyoto University in Japan, who led the research, said: 'We found that all modern cetaceans are revealed to have lost the functional taste receptors. 'These results strongly indicate that profound changes in the chemosensory capabilities had occurred in the cetacean lineage during the period when ancestral whales migrated from land to water.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal of Zoological Letters, compared the genomes of minke whales from the Antarctic with DNA from bottlenose dolphins and cows. They also used DNA sequences from Dall's porpoise and a Sei whale - the fourth biggest whale in the oceans. They also studied the fossilised skulls of several extinct species of whale. They found that the minke whales and dolphins all lacked genes for the taste receptors needed to detect sweet, umami and bitter. Indeed, previous research on DNA from other whale species has shown that some also lack many of the receptors needed to taste sour. Blue whales eat vast quantities of krill in a single gulp (pictured above) but have lost the ability to taste food . It suggests that whales' palette is largely limited to salt - something that may be overwhelming in the salty seawater environment where they live. By analysing the genomes, the researchers concluded that whales lost the ability to taste shortly after splitting from a common ancestor they share with cows. Dr Kishida said that modern whales had a greatly reduced 'gustatory capability' as a result. Toothed whales like killer whales and sperm whales also appear to have completely lost the ability to smell as they lack the parts of the nervous system required to detect and process smells. Previous research by Dr Kishida and his team has shown that baleen whales - filter feeders that include the blue whale, humpback and minke whale - also have a limited sense of smell. While they have olfactory nerves concentrated in their nasal cavities much like mammals on land, their air passages are closed while they dive. Bottlenose dolphins (above) lack the ability to taste but past research has shown they respond to some odours . Baleen whales like this Southern Right Whale are thought to have a limited sense of smell on the surface . It is thought instead that they can sniff the air, but in the most recent study the researchers also found that minke whales lack genes that allow them to smell whether food has spoiled. They were also found to lack genes that are used by land mammals to detect the presence of predators nearby - such as the smell of urine from carnivores. This ability to detect predators by scent is a common ability among most mammals on land. Dr Kishida said that the ability to smell predators may have disappeared as whales evolved as sharks and killer whales cannot be detected by smelling in the air. As whales keep their nasal passages closed when diving they would also not be able to smell under water. Chewing is also considered to be important in releasing the flavour from food, and as many cetaceans swallow their food whole, this may explain why they have lost many taste genes. Writing in the journal of Zoological Letters, Dr Kishida said: 'This study indicates that all modern cetaceans lack innate avoidance behavior against spoiled smells, and the sense of tastes. 'This could be one of the reasons why cetaceans often die from ingesting inedible debris, and has implications for whale conservation.'","Scientists at Kyoto University studied whale DNA for taste and smell genes .

They also cannot smell if their food is spoiled or detect predators by scent .

"Lloyds Banking Group is to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since it was bailed out in 2008 - and will hand over £130million to the taxpayer. The lender, which is 24 per cent Government-owned, said today its profits for 2014 was £1.8billion. After its recovery three million shareholders will today be given 75p for every share they own, resulting in payments totalling £535million. Landmark moment: Lloyds Banking Group is to pay a dividend to shareholders for the first time since it was bailed out in 2008 - and will hand over £130million to the taxpayer . Lloyds was rescued after a £20billion taxpayer injection in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. It led to it being 40 per cent owned by the Government and that stake has since been reduced to 24 per cent. It means the Treasury will pick up £130 million in dividends, but it is still a small amount compared to how much it ploughed into the bank to save it from collapse. Chancellor George Osborne said the pay-out, which required regulatory approval, was good news for millions of savers who hold Lloyds shares or have money invested in Lloyds through their pensions. He added: 'Today's results are another major milestone in the recovery of the British economy from the great recession and the bank bailouts.' The bank disclosed an annual bonus pool of £369.5 million, a decline of 3.6 per cent on the previous year. It also said its chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio received £11.5 million for 2014. He said: 'This is a symbolic development that bears testament to our successful transformation and improved risk profile of the business.' This includes more than £7 million from a long-term share-based plan which was linked to the bank's performance for the three years since 2012.","Bank is 24 per cent owned by the taxpayer after the 2008 financial crisis .

"Jailed: Adam Curnock was sentenced to seven years behind bars for sexually assaulting a child and secretly filming up girls' skirts at a school . An education welfare official who installed spy cameras around a primary school so he could secretly film up young girls' skirts has been jailed for seven years. Adam Curnock, 31, used blue tac to fix a wireless pen camera under sinks or chairs so he could covertly film girls in class or going to the toilet. The primary after-school club supervisor even filmed himself sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13 in the school's toilets before being sacked last year. Curnock would arrive at Harwood Meadows Community School in Bolton before classes commenced to set up the device before collecting it at the end of lessons. He then downloaded his sick films on to a home PC. At least 25 unsuspecting children were captured on camera during Curnock's sinister 11-month spying campaign at the school in Greater Manchester. The mixed school has more than 200 children aged from 3 to 11. Police uncovered Curnock's sick library of 57 videos after raiding his home following a tip off - and he claimed it was the 'secrecy of spying that was gratifying' to him. Further investigation revealed he also had a sick stash of 2,835 other videos and images of children dating back four years but which were not connected to the school. At Bolton Crown Court, Curnock, from Harwood, pleaded guilty to 33 charges including voyeurism, making indecent images of a child, sexual assault of a child, possessing indecent images of children, possessing prohibited images and possessing extreme pornographic images. Parents of the affected children wept in the public gallery as Colin Buckle said Curnock, who was qualified in child care, had been working as a welfare assistant and supervisor at an after school club connected to the school. The investigation began in November last year when police went to his home and seized various computer hardware. Curnock was bailed whilst officers checked the PC. But two days later he took an overdose and whilst in hospital confessed to downloading images of children. Shock: Parents of the affected children, from Harwood Meadows Community School in Bolton, wept in the public gallery today as they heard the extent of Curnock's depravity . Mr Buckle said: 'He went on to confirm in the last 12 months he had been taking a camera into the school and filming the children in the changing rooms and the disabled toilet. He said the camera operated wirelessly and was secreted under a sink with blue tack. 'He recorded images downloaded on to his personal computer. 'The mental health team contacted police. Five videos at that time were discovered which lasted up to 30 minutes mainly with the camera positioned to capture children using the toilet.' Mr Buckle said one video was filmed in a class room where a girl of six was seen sat above a mobile camera looking up her skirt. It is thought the incident occurred as she was sat on Curnock's knee. Mr Buckle said: 'This is a video in which the camera is placed in the position where he could see up the skirt and film the children. 'He confirmed it had been taken by him with the pen camera in his pocket. He denied he had any sexual gratification from the videos and said it was the secrecy of spying that was gratifying. 'He described how he charged the camera at night and got into school at 7.30am and secure the camera to the toilet. 'When his shift finished in the morning he would go home, down load the images and then go back in the afternoon and repeat the process. Sick: Curnock, 31, used blue tac to fix a wireless pen camera under a sink or chair so he could covertly film girls in class or going to the toilet - he would then get collect the device at the end of lessons . 'He told police he stopped on occasion but curiosity got the better of him and he carried on. He denied that any of the images had been shared with anyone else.. Police have informed the parents of children involved. 'The defendant said he was able to identify them and that he had a good relations with them and they trusted him. The crown point to an appalling breach of trust.' The other 52 videos were found later. The images of children not connected to the school included 1076 sexual images of the most serious kind and had been downloaded from the internet. In mitigation, defence counsel Miss Virginia Hayton said his client's remorse was 'significant and genuine.' She added: 'The hope it that children are not affected in future. The hope is that the children weren't aware. The impact will be felt by the parents involved. 'There was not distribution but for his own personal gratification and no evidence to suggest he has shared any of these videos or images with anyone else and it is not financially motivated. The defendant tells me he is extremely sorry and he knows it is not enough. Long list of charges: At Bolton Crown Court (above), Curnock, from Harwood, pleaded guilty to 33 charges including voyeurism, making indecent images of a child and sexual assault of a child . 'He enjoyed and extremely strong relationship with the children and parents who used the facilities of the school. He knows he has lost both their trust. He doesn't expect anyone to forgive him. 'He is aware he has a problem and need help in reducing any further to members of the public and children. He has asked his family not to attend court and he knows he has brought significant shame on his family and himself.. He is very sorry for that.' Greater Manchester Police's Professional Standards Branch is continuing to investigate why officers failed to react to earlier intelligence on Curnock's actions. Detective Chief Inspector Sara Wallwork, said: 'These offences are a gross violation of the children's privacy and trust. 'His actions were deliberate and calculated and he has rightly been jailed for these terrible crimes. 'We have worked closely with the local authority and community throughout this investigation, which I know has left many shocked and appalled.'","Adam Curnock was a supervisor at Harwood Meadows School in Bolton .

"Hillary Clinton is a politician of 'yesterday' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told a gathering of conservatives on Friday. In a word-association game with Fox News host Sean Hannity, the Republican senator - considered likely to run for the White House in 2016 - offered a scathing assessment of the Democrat, who is expected to announce her own presidential campaign later this year. Hannity asked Rubio about former president Bill Clinton to which Rubio first replied, 'What's the next one?' before saying the 42nd president of the United States is 'really yesterday'. Asked about the current Commander in Chief, Barack Obama, Rubio simply said: 'failed.' Rubio was the first in a line of likely Republican presidential candidates to address attendees of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday morning, now in its second day of speakers. Florida Senator Marco Rubio told a gathering of conservatives on Friday that Hillary Clinton is a politician of 'yesterday.' The freshman lawmaker said he is still undecided about his political plans while acknowledging that he wants to 'pay back in some way' the country for the opportunities it has provided his family . 'I don't want to be in politics my whole life,' Rubio told Fox News Host Sean Hannity during a question and answer session during his appearance. He noted that he'd perhaps like to own an NFL team at some point. 'I don't know, I'd have to sell a lot of books for that,' the two time author joked . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina,  Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson all spoke to the confab on Thursday. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush were set to take the main stage on Friday. A notable exception to lineup was former Arkansas Gov. and Fox News host Mike Huckabee, who has said he is considering a bid in 2016 yet didn't participate in the Washington, D.C. area powwow that attracts roughly 10,000 conservatives from across the country each year.' Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said Friday he is still undecided about his own political plans while acknowledging that he wants to 'pay back in some way' the country for the opportunities it has provided his family. 'I don't want my kids to come up and one day ask me, ""how come you got to grow up in the greatest country in the world, but we get to grow up in a country's that's been diminished?"" ' Rubio said. The freshman senator said would 'have to decide through careful prayer' if running for president is the best decision at this stage in his life. Rubio reaffirmed that if he does make a play for the presidency, he won't seek reelection to his Senate seat even though Florida law allows him to do both simultaneously. 'I think if you want to want to be president, you decide that's what you've been called at this time in your life to at least run for, you believe that''s the best way for your to serve America, that's what you run for,' he told Hannity. 'The truth is Sean, I don't want to be in politics my whole life,' he added, noting that he'd perhaps like to own an NFL team at some point. 'I don't know, I'd have to sell a lot of books for that,' the two time author joked. Results of the conference's straw poll for the presidential race weren't to be revealed until Saturday evening, but based on the number the conference goers who showed up to see Rubio speak and stayed until the end of his 20 minute session, he's likely to take a top placement. After Perry, who drew a noticeably smaller crowd that Rubio in the first place, finished his prepared remarks, guests flooded out of the room before the interview portion of his appearance began.","Rubio was the first in a line of likely GOP presidential candidates to address the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday morning .

"The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the U.S. has finally cashed a personal check for $974.8 million. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm credits the check with putting his divorce 'in the rear-view mirror'. Sue Ann Arnall had at first rejected the check, which Hamm said laid around for 'a week or so', and said the judge had grossly undervalued her stake in Hamm's vast oil fortune. She slammed the court's ruling as 'inappropriate' and 'not fair', believing her ex-husband is worth an estimated $18 billion. Scroll down for videos . Sue Ann Arnall (pictured during her divorce proceedings in September) has finally cashed a a personal check for $974.8 million from ex-husband Harold Hamm . No thanks: In an effort to end the divorce, Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife for $974.8 million, however she at first turned it down, claiming it was not a fair cut of his wealth . Pay up: Mr. Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup, meaning she is entitled to half the assets earned during their marriage. Her lawyers claim he is worth about $18 billion . Hamm said the famous check got the job done, and now he's moving on. But Arnall has other plans. Although Hamm's lawyers said that cashing the check nullifies Arnall's appeal, her attorneys will continue to pursue the case, according to NBC News. And Hamm's lawyers aren't going to stop either. Hamm filed his own appeal, claiming the amount was too high - and that he deserves some of that money back. Hamm founded Continental Resources in 1967 and Arnall was an executive at the company. The couple were married 26 years but never signed a prenuptial agreement. Hamm had already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings. Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with two of the couple's Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. Arnall made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued. The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999. Real estate portfolio: Miss Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma . Relaxed living: The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma . Miss Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her. The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Miss Arnall were married. During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division. Miss Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Mr. Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent. 'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. The Mansion: Miss Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Mr. Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion . Miss Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Mr. Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth. Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. A behemoth that Mr. Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Miss Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years. And there's somehow more. That aforementioned $9billion fortune of Mr. Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil. Filing for divorce in March 2013, Miss Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage. Big score: In 2012, Mr. Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife . Mr. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream. Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Mr. Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well. And while Mr. Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years. In 2012, Mr. Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million. Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Mr. Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign . It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer Mr. Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Miss Arnall. It was also in early 2012 that Mr. Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the Time 100 for that year. He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna. The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. Miss Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.","Sue Ann Arnall has finally cashed personal check for $974.8 million from ex-husband, Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm .

The prosecution does not dispute Andrews is mentally ill but that he was sane at the time of Barga-Milbury's murder. Mrs Barga-Milbury was shot twice - once in the hip and once in the leg. Her body was found by her 16-year-old son, who came from school to find her lying dead in the entryway of their home. The psychologist said she interviewed Andrews for about five hours. She said Andrews believed the voice of God commanded him to kill Barga-Milbury. He was convinced Barga-Milbury was a vampire, said Murphy who testified as a defense witness. She told the court that Andrews would follow what the voices in his head told him to do and that he had been hospitalized eight times for his mental issues. Deputy District Attorney Matt Kraut produced a rifle to the jury that was the same make as the one used to shoot  Barga-Milbury. Evidence: Deputy District Attorney Matt Kraut produces a gun similar to the one allegedly used by Mark Andrews to twice shoot the victim, killing her . Kraut said medical reports showed the gun was about 24 inches from the woman's head when she was shot, showing Andrews had plotted her death. 'He was on point,' Kraut told the court. 'He was organized. He was not psychotic. 'And that's exactly how he was when he killed colleen in the entry way of her own home – in cold blood.' According to the San Luis Obispo Tribune, Kraut said Andrews had several interactions with people before the murder who did not report finding anything amiss with his behavior. The police who interviewed Andrews after Barga-Mulbury's death described his as stable, as did a treating psychiatrist and jail staff. However court records show that, in 2009, Andrews believed a different neighbor was a vampire. He left mounds of dirt and flour on the woman's front porch. He once also pounded on her door, screaming she was a 'b----'. The court was also played a video recording of Andrews telling his mother: 'I just want to be executed and die.' A jury of six men and six women are now deliberating. Closing arguments finished on Thursday afternoon.","Mark Andrews, 51, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to shooting dead Colleen Barga-Milbury, 52 .

"Arrested: Christopher L. McCullum, 43, of Louisville, Kentucky shot Mukhtar Ahmed on a highway . A man has been charged with killing a Muslim father-of-three after he shot him while driving down  a highway  in Kentucky. Christopher L. McCullum, 43, of Louisville, Kentucky was driving on Interstate 71 on Wednesday, when he spotted Mukhtar Ahmed, 41, in a separate lane and opened fire. Ahmed was shot multiple times through the passenger door of his black SUV and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said the shooting was a 'completely random act of road rage,' as there was no connection between McCullum and his victim. Ahmed leaves behind a wife and three young children including a 13-year-old girl and two boys, aged eight and five. However the local Pakistani-American community fear that it was a faith-based hate crime as Ahmed was a Muslim. Khalid Kahloon, Ahmed's family attorney, told NBC News: 'As an Asian-American Muslim community living in America at this time, the community is very sensitive and apprehensive.' 'This is a source of great discomfort to the community as to why a member would be murdered in this way. 'We cannot say it is for certain about race, but deep down in our hearts we cannot say that it was just another senseless murder on the American highway.' Ahmed, an immigrant from Pakistan, had just dropped off his daughter at school and was driving on Interstate 71 in Louisville at 9 am, when the incident unfolded. Scroll down for video . Victim: Mukhtar Ahmed was driving on Interstate 71 in Louisville, when he was shot multiple times . Hard working: Ahmed had been living in the United States for many years and worked with his brother in a grocery retail business . SUV: Ahmed was shot multiple times through the passenger door of his black SUV, pictured here, and died . He was near the Gene Snyder Freeway when he was shot, according to Ahmed's family attorney. Early reports from Lex18.com said police were looking for the suspect who fled  in a white Ford van. He was found three hours later, at noon, when police located a van which matched the description. Eyewitnesses said the driver was dressed in overalls and was calmly chatting with officers after they got him out of the van. His vehicle sat on the ramp for close to 90 minutes allowing a police technician to check it for evidence. The suspect was then taken away in the back of a cruiser. He was arrested and charged with murder. But there is still no indication of what sparked the dispute. Police Chief Steve Conrad told local media: 'I don't exactly know the motive. It appears, based on what I know, to be some sort of road rage incident, but I don't know that for a fact.' Kahloon said Ahmed had been living in the United States for many years and worked with his brother in a grocery retail business.. The local Louisville Pakistani-American community is small and made up of 100-150 families. Kahloon added: '[Ahmed] had great ambition. He was hard working, a strong family man, with a good sense of his role in the community. 'He never had any issue with any customer, and always preferred a peaceful resolution.' Police: Eyewitnesses said McCullum was dressed in overalls and was calmly chatting with officers after they got him out of the van, he was then taken away in the back of a cruiser . Scene: Early reports said police were looking for the suspect who fled the scene in a white Ford van . Meanwhile, the suspect, McCullum described himself as 'self employed and the owner of A&J's Electric' on his Facebook page. He also stated he was in the U.S. Navy. He was expected to be arraigned on Thursday. However, it has also emerged that he has a history of mental illness and substance abuse and is currently involved in a series of legal run-ins. According to records obtained by WDRB.com the 43-year-old was going through a divorce. He had been married since 1997 and had two teen boys but had moved out of his family home and listed his address as 'a white Ford van.' In a July 2014 order by Family Court Judge Stephen George he stated that McCullum had a 'history of mental illness and substance abuse that affected his work.' The judge wrote: 'He is unable to sufficiently supervise his employees and often walks off of jobs.' Despite owning his own business A & J Electric, McCullum was not working. His electrical licence had been suspended after he failed to pay fees records from his divorce case showed. He had not filed his taxes in several years, according to the records. Additionally, he was supposed to be paying child support. Divorce: According to records 43-year-old McCullum was going through a divorce and had moved out of his family home. He listed his address as 'a white Ford van,' pictured here, being inspected by police officers . Lawyer: The suspect was taken into custody by an officer after the shooting, but his former lawyer described him as a 'good guy, generally mild mannered,' and said he would be 'surprised' if he was involved . Legal troubles: McCullum, pictured with two officers, was also scheduled to be in Jefferson District Court on March 26 to deal with an additional trespassing conviction . In October 2014, McCullum was arrested by Louisville Metro Police while carrying four loaded handguns, two rifles and a crossbow police said. An officer who pulled him over for driving with a shattered windshield and expired tags noticed a loose 9mm bullet rolling on the driver side floorboard. They also found marijuana, drug paraphernalia and several weapons inside the van. The two rifles and two of the handguns were wrapped in a pair of overalls on the floorboard of the white van. One of the guns was described as being a German Luger pistol. Two other handguns were found behind the passenger seat. McCullum, however, did not have a concealed weapon license. But his lawyer successfully argued that the guns were 'older, family guns' he'd inherited and he was taking them out to a farm to shoot.' He got a plea deal and was sentenced to 90 days in jail which was conditionally discharged for two years, as long as he stayed out of trouble. In a separate case, McCullum was scheduled to be in Jefferson District Court on March 26 to deal with a recent trespassing conviction. He had gone into a person's yard and tapped into their breaker box to use their power without permission. His former lawyer described him as a 'good guy, generally mild mannered,' and said he would be 'surprised' if he was involved in Wednesday's shooting.","Christopher L.

"As one of the world's most in-demand models, looking good is the key to Jourdan Dunn's career. With countless catwalk appearances and major campaigns under her belt, Jourdan is clearly doing something right...so what's her secret? FEMAIL caught up with the Maybelline New York ambassadress to find out - and we discovered that an exhaustive eight-step beauty regime that takes her nearly an hour a day is behind her flawless supermodel skin. Jourdan Dunn is one of the most esteemed supermodels in the world so FEMAIL caught up with her about her skincare regime, diet and favourite fashion week moments . Sharing her 'hardcore' beauty regime, Jourdan told us: 'I visited Tokyo and became obsessed with their skincare, which is very advanced. Their regimes have loads more steps but I incorporated some of their techniques into mine and developed my own eight step regime. 'It takes me a good twenty minutes in the morning and then about half an hour in the evening.' The secret behind her flawless skin? An eight step skincare regime and lip balm as eyeshadow and cheek tint . Jourdan, who has been sitting front row at fashion week and is currently the face of Burberry, has picked up some quirky beauty tips during her time in the industry. Her favourites? 'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised. She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. Jourdan has been working for Maybelline New York since last April and gave the brand's new products a spin over London Fashion Week . (L to R) Pixie Geldof, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, Sir Philip Green and Jourdan Dunn attend the Topshop Unique show during London Fashion Week . When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in. 'I like to eat healthy,' she said. 'I love good greens and fish and I'm not really a snacker. 'Luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved. There used to be nothing or just really boring food but they've really stepped it up. Diane Von Furstenberg even had an amazing gluten-free buffet backstage at her show.' To keep herself sane amid the backstage madness, Jourdan swears by meditating, which she says helps her 'zone out'. She cites her favourite thing about fashion week as seeing her friends (a roll call of the coolest young models in the industry including Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid). 'I don't get to see my friends very often and travelling around the world for shows can be really lonely and boring so I love it when me and my pals are all together for a catch-up,' she said. Jourdan, seen walking in Naomi Campbell's charity Fashion For Relief show, is currently the face of Burberry alongside her fellow supermodel . The six foot clothes horse, who has been dubbed the modern-day Naomi Campbell, has been working as the face of Maybelline New York since April last year. Jourdan joined an elite group of models who have worked for the brand, including Christy Turlington, Adriana Lima, Erin Wasson, Emily DiDonato and Mollie King. As a  Vogue regular, who was scouted in Primark in her teens, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career. When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia . (L to R) Sam Smith, Cara Delevingne, Jourdan Dunn, Kate Moss, Mario Testino and Naomi Campbell attend the Burberry Prorsum AW 2015 show .

When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. This has led to Jourdan’s active involvement as the Parent Ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and the future is looking bright for the young starlet. She explained: 'I am collaborating on a sunglasses range and designing my own kidswear line. My son is really involved and has been helping me choose the colours and designs.'","Jourdan, 24, picked up skincare tips after visit to Tokyo .

"A baby who was stolen from her sleeping mother's arms 17 years ago has been reunited with her parents after ending up at the same school as her biological sister. Zephany Nurse was snatched from a Cape Town hospital in 1987 when she was just three days old. She was reconciled with her biological family after pupils at a high school Cape Town noticed a striking similarity between girls Zephany and Cassidy, born three years apart. Snatched: Zephany Nurse pictured with her mother at a Cape Town hospital in 1987 . Seeing the resemblance, Cassidy, aged 14, invited the older lookalike to meet her parents, and they immediately recognised their long lost first-born and contacted police. Her real parents Celeste and Morne Nurse had been living only a short distance apart all these years and had never given up hope of finding her, celebrating her birthday every year with their three other children. DNA tests revealed Zephany was their child and police have now charged a 50 year old woman with kidnapping. Never forgotten: The nurse family celebrated Zephany's birthday each year in her absence. They have been reunited after fellow pupils remarked how similar she looked to what was in fact her biological sister . Celeste Nurse, right, leaves court today after attending the appearance of a woman charged with kidnapping her daughter 17 years ago . Zephany grew up with a different name, and a different family, never knowing she was not their real daughter. But last month Cassidy started high school at the same school as Zephany and fellow pupils noticed a startling resemblance she bore to a final-year student. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel André Traut confirmed that a woman had been arrested. She and her husband, who is also in his fifties, have no other children. 'The suspect is being charged with kidnapping, fraud and contravening sections of the Children's Act, in that she fraudulently pretended that she was the biological mother of a child,' Traut said. 'The kidnapped girl has since been placed in the care of the Department of Social Services of the Western Cape Government.'","Zephany Nurse was three days old when snatched from a  hospital .

"Victims, including former firearms instructor Lewis Reynolds (above), were involuntarily sterilized by state officials in Virginia more than 30 years ago and will now be given $25,000 compensation each . Victims who were involuntarily sterilized by state officials more than 30 years ago  will be compensated. More than 7,000 people were permanently made infertile between 1924 and 1979 under the Virginia Eugenical Sterilization Act. The Act was widely accepted at the time and was even said to have partly inspired Adolf Hitler to create a master race in Germany. But now the 11 victims who are still alive will receive $25,000 in compensation, Virginia General Assembly decided on Thursday. Eugenics sought to improve the genetic composition of humankind by preventing those considered 'defective' from reproducing. One victim, Lewis Reynolds, was presumed to have epilepsy when he was 13-years-old and was taken to one of six state institutions to be treated. Decades later he discovered the fits were a temporary symptom after he was hit in the head with a rock - but the sterilization was permanent. The 87-year-old former firearms instructor, from Lynchburg, said: 'I think they've done me wrong. 'I couldn't have a family like everybody else does. They took my rights away.' Reynolds' first wife left him after she learned they couldn't have children. And although his marriage to second wife Delores lasted 47 years,  the couple would cry about their inability to have a family. The compensation measure was sponsored by Ben Cline, a conservative Republican from Rockbridge, and Patrick Hope, a liberal Democrat from Arlington. Mr Cline said: 'There was a growing consensus that we needed to act while we still had the opportunity to look these people in the eye and acknowledge the wrong that was committed against them so many years ago.' Ben Cline (above) attends the Virginia House of Delegates on Thursday as they approve a budget of $400,000 to compensate victims of involuntary sterilization . Mr Hope said: 'I think it's a recognition when we do something wrong we need to fix it as a government. 'Now we can close this final chapter and healing can begin.' Nearly 65,000 Americans were sterilized in 33 states, including more than 20,000 in California alone. One judge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., said in 1927: 'Three generations of imbeciles are enough.' Virginia is the second state to approve compensation for victims of the eugenics program. North Carolina approved payments of $50,000 to around 1,800 victims in 2013.","More than 7,000 Virginians were made infertile between 1924 and 1979 .

"Shoppers are being 'misled' by supermarkets selling 'wine based drink' which is only 75 per cent wine in bottles that look like the real thing. The Australian plonk looks like a normal bottle and is sold in supermarkets alongside real wine - but the small print reveals all is not as it seems. The labels show that the 'wine based drinks' are not proper wine, with experts calling on producers to come clean about what else goes into the drink. Shoppers are being 'misled' by supermarkets selling 'wine based drink' which is only 75 per cent wine . The Australian plonk looks like a normal bottle and is sold in supermarkets alongside real wine - but the small print reveals all is not as it seems . Industry guidelines state that any drink containing less than 75 per cent wine must be described as a 'wine based drink', but suppliers do not have to say what the rest is, other than sulphur dioxide or any allergens. Sainsbury's is selling Copper Red and Copper White with 12.5 per cent alcohol at a price of £6.25. Morrisons is stocking Shy Pig Red and White, at 11 per cent and 10.5 per cent alcohol, amongst some of their most popular buys at £3.29. Tesco was selling an Australian brand called Umber, both in red and white, but has since withdrawn it from shelves. The discovery was made by experts at the website Wot Wine, who taste and rate wines. A spokesman for the company said consumers were being 'misled' by the 'so-called wine'. The 'so-called wines' are being sold at Sainsbury's and Morrisons but have been taken off shelves at Tesco . Industry guidelines state that any drink containing less than 75 per cent wine must be described as a 'wine based drink' He said: 'Some of the wines were passable, just lacking genuine character and dilute, whilst others were unpleasant, not genuine, contrived and manufactured tasting. 'On later revealing the labels we noticed that in small print on the back label these products were termed 'Wine Based Drinks'. 'The fact that we had been misled into buying them as wine led us to do some more investigation. 'We understand that supermarkets might find it difficult to have another section for these products on their shelves and may wish to merchandise them with wines, but we feel that low strength, low calorie and these drinks might all be best for their customers if merchandised clearly for what they are all together. 'I suspect the other 25 per cent is water, but it could be unfermented grape must which would be better as at least that's in wine,' he added. 'The so-called wine is highly misleading and it's bad for the wine industry. It damages the industry's integrity. Wine experts say selling the bottles alongside real wine is 'misleading', and that consumers have a right to know the full ingredients in the drink . 'You can sell what you like but you should tell the customer what it is, because it's not wine. It reminds me of the days when dodgy landlords would tip water into barrels of beer. 'When something is sold as wine but it isn't, that is beyond the pale. I don't think most people buying it realise what it is.' In reviews on their website, Wot Wine said they would not pay a penny for many of the imitation wines, calling Copper Red: 'Unattractive, poor. Bitter and sweet thin drink.' Copper White was given an even worse review, which read: 'Nasty. Unclean, pongy, thin, acidic.' The experts did say they would pay £3.50 for Shy Pig's Juicy Red, but not the Crisp White, which had a 'sour, unfermented grape juice flavour'. The European industry body, the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, states that to be called a 'wine based drink' the product must contain a minimum of 75 per cent wine. All of the wines were made by Australian Vintage Ltd and were shipped in bulk to the UK where they were bottled. An Australian Vintage spokesman said: 'We abide by all legal requirements and continually review our processes and procedures to ensure this. 'It is categorized as a wine based drink as there is an addition of sugar and water in the production process.' A Morrisons spokesman said: 'It's important to us that customers can find products where they would expect them to be, so that their journey around our stores is as smooth as possible. 'Every wine product we offer is clearly labelled as such so that our shoppers can make an informed decision about what they're putting in to their basket.' A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said: 'Copper Australian Red is clearly labelled as a wine based drink. With an ABV of 12.5 per cent, it is appropriate for it to be stocked within the wine aisle, along with other wine based products. 'We clearly label all of our products so that our customers can make informed choices when shopping with us.' Tesco has been contacted for comment. Wot Wine's experts reviewed each bottle, and were less than impressed by most. They said they would not pay for most of the 'wine based drinks' tested, some of which cost as much as £6.25.

"Rows upon rows of once-majestic aircraft are lined up in the baking heat of Arizona's Tucson desert, left abandoned in piles of metal. This is where planes go to die - a 2,600-acre patch of U.S. desert where several generations of military aircraft are stored in what has been dubbed 'The Boneyard'. Now, Microsoft's Bing has created a stunning 'megapixel' view of this eerie sight using satellite imagery that allows anyone to explore the area in unprecedented, three dimensional detail. Zoom in on the interactive map below to explore the plane graveyard and scroll down for video . Some planes are merely stored at the base between deployments, but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,200 aircraft that call it home, it is a cemetery of steel - 350,000 items to be called on when needed. The desert is a perfect place to store the mass of steel, because low humidity and rainfall means very little rust occurs. The hard soil also means they can be parked up without the need for building concrete ramps. Engines, munitions, wiring and electronics are all recycled to help lower the cost of maintaining the current-day fleet. In 2005, staff at the facility recycled more than 19,000 parts worth $568million (£366million). The Boneyard contains everything from enormous cargo lifters to bombers, A10 Thunderbolts, Hercules freighters and the F-14 Tomcat fighters. The planes go on and on, in rows with some appearing newly parked, while others are hidden in protective coverings to keep out the elements. The base, home to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG), carries out repairs to the craft and even gets some of them flying again. The site has been a curiosity for eagle-eyed Google Earth users since the satellite imagery software was launched in 2005, but now for the first time it is available to view in high resolution. The $35billion (£22billion) worth of outdated planes is kept as spare parts for current models at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. Some planes are merely stored at the base between deployments, but for more than 80 per cent of the 4,200 aircraft that call it home, it is a cemetery of steel - 350,000 items to be called on when needed. Engines, munitions, wiring and electronics are all recycled to help lower the cost of maintaining the current-day fleet. In 2005, staff at the facility recycled more than 19,000 parts worth $568million (£366million). The U.S. government even allows the military in other countries to buy parts and even planes from the site. The facility is the size of 1,300 football pitches. 'As long as there are aircraft flying, military and commercial aircraft boneyards will always be necessary to keep other planes in the air,' aviation author Nick Veronico, who has visited Davis-Monthan told the BBC. 'Each of the storage yards typically performs a variety of functions from storing aircraft that are temporarily out of service but expected to return to the fleet, to reclaiming useable parts which are inspected, overhauled, and then held until needed by active aircraft, to dismantling of the aircraft carcasses.' The Boneyard contains everything from cargo lifters to bombers, A10 Thunderbolts, Hercules freighters and the F-14 Tomcat fighters . The planes go on and on, in rows with some appearing newly parked such as the left images of the B52 StratoFortress, while others are hidden in protective coverings to keep out the elements, or lay in scrap heaps . One of the reasons aircraft are kept here is because in the desert there is low humidity and rainfall which means very little rust occurs . Immediately after World War II, the Army's San Antonio Air Technical Service Command established a storage facility for B-29 and C-47 aircraft at Davis-Monthan AFB. Today, this facility is the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (309 AMARG), which has grown to include more than 4,400 aircraft and 13 aerospace vehicles from the Air Force, Navy-Marine Corps, Army, Coast Guard. The planes are kept in various states of restoration, with some coming back to life long being abandoned at the Boneyard. Earlier this month, for instance, an enormous Cold War-era bomber which first flew in 1962 was resurrected from the Air Force's scrap heap to serve the nation once more. The desert is a perfect place to store the mass of steel, because low humidity and rainfall means very little rust occurs. The hard soil also means they can be parked up without the need for building concrete ramps. The military has used Davis-Monthan as a plane storage facility for 60 years, and in recent years its unique landscape has been called on by Hollywood for such films as Transformers. While it isn't the only aircraft boneyard in the world, it is the largest, containing around 4,400 aircraft. Planes that have served on aircraft carriers have to be washed to get rid of salt. All aircraft have their fuel tanks lines drained and any explosive devices are removed. Ducts are covered with tape and the aircraft are painted over in white to help deflect the sun's rays. The planes are kept in various states of restoration, with some coming back to life long being abandoned at the Boneyard. Earlier this month, for instance, an enormous Cold War-era bomber which first flew in 1962 was resurrected from the Air Force's scrap heap to serve the nation once more. The B-52, nicknamed Ghost Rider, was mothballed seven years ago at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. It took to the skies once more on February 13 after months of painstaking restoration, which saw damaged parts such as the fuel lines and hydraulic steering systems replaced to make her airworthy once more. When fully functional, Ghost Rider will be capable of unleashing 70,000lbs of weapons, conventional or nuclear, almost anywhere on the planet. The plane, which will be one of 76 kept flying the the Air Force, has a range of 8,000 miles on one fuel tank, and can travel 650mph at altitudes as high as 50,000ft. In a published report on the restoration, Colonel Keith Schultz, who piloted Ghost Rider, said: 'I've been flying the B-52s since the 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years...she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems. 'It took a little under three hours for the flight and we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed.'

"Nigel Farage warned Thursday night in America that the U.S. Republican party will become a dinosaur – not an elephant – if it continues to embrace the political center. 'I suspect that if the Republican Party sticks with the establishment it will lose,' he told Daily Mail Online after a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference. The GOP 'has got to reach the Hispanic community, but it's also got to reach that blue-collar community that Reagan got to vote for him in huge numbers. I'm not sure at the moment that they're positioning themselves to do that.' CPAC is an annual three-day mecca for constitutional evangelists, anti-Obamacare shock troops, full-throated abortion opponents and gun rights activists. Many of them think the Republican Party is only slightly less liberal and nanny-statist than the president. Farage fit right in, keeping backstage handlers waiting for his appointment to test a lapel microphone while he smoked a cigar in the cold, outside the Maryland resort hotel where more than a thousand stayed into the dinner hour to hear him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'WE'RE NOT THE TEA PARTY': Nigel Farage, whose UK Independence Party is challenging both Tories and Liberals, said his is a real political force, not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party . The Conservative Political Action Conference brings all manner of right-wingers to a hotel in Maryland each year . 'I think the Republican Party is going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain,' he said in an interview backstage. The British political contrarian, long at the helm of the UK Independence Party, plied the conservative audience with a dry-witted vision of how his political travails could show disaffected American right-wingers the way forward. UKIP, he boasted, is 'an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels.' But don't confuse him with the tea party, he said after the applause ended. 'We're not the tea party,' Farage insisted one-on-one. 'Our job is not to influence one political party. We're not an outlier from the Tories.' And unlike the tea party phenomenon, which peels off disaffected Republicans who believe their traditional party has moved too far left, he said, his group 'is not just retired half-colonels who've always voted Conservative and now they're UKIP. We're dragging them from across the spectrum.' Farage's rhetoric about immigration, Britain's Judeo-Christian foundation, political correctness and regulation run amok made up a song he sang to a crowd that had already memorized the verses. 'If you discuss immigration, it means you're a bad person,' he complained – 'that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else.' And Farage spared no harsh words for Barack Obama, saying that he sees 'an American president who doesn't have the courage' to fight against Islamist terror. Obama, he claimed, lacks the vision to see 'what has gone wrong, and why those three people were arrested on the streets of the USA yesterday.' That was a reference to the trio of Muslim men who were detained by the FBI after they began the process of traveling to Syria for training with the ISIS terror army – with the intention of bringing death and destruction back to America. 'We must stand firm and defend our Judeo-Christian culture,' Farage said, earnign his first boisterous applause. 'We must make it clear that we believe in common law and not Shariah law.' He called radical Islam 'an enemy within' both the U.S. and the UK. Farage also told Daily Mail Online that Prime Minister David Cameron's government was wrong to ask The Washington Post and other news outlets to withhold the name of London resident Mohammed Emwazi, who the paper identified on Thursday as the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.' 'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.' Farage said 'the Republican Party is going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain' 'If you discuss immigration, it means you're a bad person,' he complained to a thousand convention-goers – 'that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else' He was quick, as always, to link talk of ISIS to Britain's immigration 'crisis,' consisting of a doors-wide-open policy to the rest of the European Union. 'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.' He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.' 'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.' 'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it.' Is that xenophobic? Farage doesn't think so. 'The thing about us,' he said of the UK, 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.' While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.' UKIP typically sees its share of trouble in the British press, usually when one of its own makes a public gaffe worthy of Joe Biden. CPAC's lineup includes Sarah Palin, whose teleprompter played tricks on her last month in Iowa, leaving her rambling for minutes . The CPAC conference draws conservatives from all over the US, but they share the same message . Like any political force testing its boundaries by casting a wide net, it would be recognizable to American conservatives who have had to contend with their own brand of bad publicity. Todd Akin, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, famously self-imploded after musing on whether abortions should be allowed in cases of 'legitimate rape.' Sarah Palin just last month lost track of her teleprompter during a key Iowa speech and rambled aimlessly for what seemed like hours, causing some to wonder if she was intoxicated. An ocean away, UKIP councillor Rozanne Duncan was kicked out this month after she was filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features.' And social media accounts belonging to UKIP activist Richard Crouch were plastered recently with claims that his home town of Leicester is a 'sh*thole' and 'full of P***s.' His Facebook account called Asians 'The Taliban' and labeled Romanians 'pick pocketing criminals.' Crouch insisted that his account was hacked, but the damage was done. Farage threw up his hands and suggested that idiots will be idiots. 'Well, look,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'people like Rozanne Duncan are local councillors. They are very low-level people in UKIP. They're not major players.' 'Yes, we get people who say stupid things in UKIP. I don't approve or condone any of it.'","Farage spoke with Daily Mail Online after a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference .

"A clean-living Indianapolis cop wound up in hospital after taking a gulp of iced tea that turned out to be contaminated with cleaning chemicals. Before going on shift on Saturday night at about 10pm, Reserve Officer Paul Watkins stopped at an Indianapolis McDonald's for a self-serve tea. As usual he filled his cup half with unsweetened tea, but before filling the rest with sweet tea he noticed the tea looked dark. He took the lid off the dispenser but decided that all seemed OK. 'He filled his cup and took a big gulp and immediately his throat started burning down into his chest,' his wife Jerilyn told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Before going on shift on Saturday night, Reserve Officer Paul Watkins, pictured with his wife Jerilyn, stopped at a West Indianapolis McDonald's for a self-serve tea, and ended up becoming violently ill . After he spit out the tea and told staff, the manager explained that employees had put cleaning liquid into the dispenser but had forgotten to put a cup over the nozzle . Watkins spit out the tea and immediately told staff at the counter that something was wrong. The manager explained that employees had put cleaning liquid into the dispenser but had forgotten to put a cup over the nozzle, according to Jerilyn. Jerilyn was not with him at the time but he called her from his police car, told her the story, and said he felt as though he just drank bleach. Officer Watkins then became violently ill. He called the police station and poison control, who determined that the tea dispenser was filled with a heavy duty degreasing chemical, according to the police report. Watkins spent the night at IU Health Methodist Hospital and underwent an endoscopy the next day. He still has problems swallowing, experiences a burning sensation in his throat, and is concerned about the long-term effects of having ingested chemicals. 'My husband has never drank, never smoked, never done drugs,' said Jerilyn. 'This is just insane.' Officer Watkins is concerned about the long term effects of ingesting the chemicals. 'My husband has never drank, never smoked, never done drugs,' said his wife Jerilyn . Poison Control determined that the tea dispenser was filled with a heavy duty degreasing chemical, according to the police report of the incident . McDonald's has its own brand of degreaser solution for cleaning its restaurants . Elizabeth Henry, the owner of the McDonald's on 38th Street where Watkins was served, issued a statement: 'Serving my customers safe, high quality food and beverages is a top priority at our restaurants. We take this claim very seriously and are looking into the matter.' A similar incident occurred at a McDonald's in Muncie, Indiana, in 2013. A teenager has since filed a law suit, to which McDonald's must respond by the end of March. Sam Jacobs, Watkins' lawyer, has said that he has not yet filed a law suit on his client's behalf and hopes that he is able to work out something with McDonald's before doing so. 'He never wants this to happen to anybody else,' Jacobs said. Referring to the night of the incident, Jacobs said: 'The irony of this all was that manager asked Paul if he wanted another cup or glass of tea and told one of the employees, ""Hey, get this guy another tea"".' Watkins declined.","An Indianapolis cop stopped at a local McDonald's to grab an iced tea before going on shift .

"A Hong Kong woman who tortured her Indonesian maid in a case that sparked worldwide outrage has been handed a six-year jail sentence. Law Wan-tung was sentenced after her conviction earlier this month on eight charges of assault, grievous bodily harm and criminal intimidation against 24-year-old Erwiana Sulistyaningsih. The brutal case highlighted the vulnerabilities of migrants working as domestic staff across Asia and the Middle East. Scroll down for video . Law Wan-tung has been found guilty of torturing her Indonesian maid, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih - who is pictured above at a hospital in Sragen, Indonesia, after her case first came to light . The court heard that Law punched Ms Sulistyaningsih in the mouth, fracturing some teeth. Ms Sulistyaningsih is pictured above recovering from her injuries . Ms Sulistyaningsih, centre, accompanied by her supporters, walks out of the court in Hong Kong . District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said she was 'sure' Law, seen above leaving the court last month, did assault, wound and threaten Ms Sulistyaningsih as charged . The mother-of-two, 45, had no reaction as the sentence was handed down by District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock, who said 'the seriousness of the charges and circumstances of the offences means a lengthy prison time is appropriate.' The judge fined Law 15,000 Hong Kong dollars (£1,250) for 10 charges of failing to pay wages or grant time off. She had earlier pleaded guilty to one other charge of failing to buy insurance. It gained widespread attention about a year ago after photos of her injuries circulated among Indonesians in Hong Kong. They showed her face, hands and legs covered with scabs and lacerations, and blackened, peeling skin around her feet. Speaking through an interpreter outside court, she told reporters: 'I am so happy because finally my employer is in prison although only for six years. But for me, finally justice is delivered,' District Court Judge Amanda Woodcock said Law had a definite 'lack of compassion' and her 'contempt was reserved for those she saw as beneath her.' The court heard that Law punched Ms Sulistyaningsih in the mouth, fracturing some teeth; jammed a metal vacuum cleaner tube in her mouth, cutting her lip; and hit her on the back with a feather duster when she was sleeping. Law also forced the maid to stand naked in the bathroom during winter while she splashed water on and pointed a fan at her. Ms Sulistyaningsih, who worked for Law for about eight months starting in June 2013, wasn't allowed any days off and was not paid her salary. Law was found not guilty of two other charges. After the verdict earlier this month, supporters applauded Ms Sulistyaningsih who said she was happy 'because I will get the justice from Hong Kong'. There are about 330,000 foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong, almost all female and most from the Philippines or Indonesia, earning a minimum wage of about £328 a month.

"Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, praised the security services' handing of threats from UK terror cells, saying the law must keep ahead of the threat . The former head of MI6 today warns there are ‘several thousand’ individuals of concern in Britain as he demands tougher anti-terror powers to prevent a ‘ghastly 7/7-style attack’. Sir John Sawers also speaks out against the criticism of security services over their handling of Mohammed Emwazi – unmasked as Jihadi John – who is known to have been on their radar for at least six years. He will tell Radio 4’s Today: ‘The threat that we face from terrorists here has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that. ‘What we don’t want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7-style terrorist attack here in the UK before political opinion changes. ‘The whole point is to move incrementally to ensure that the powers and resources available to the security services, intelligence services, are ahead of that threat.’ Sir John, who stepped down from MI6 last November, added: ‘I think in general when you look at the challenge that the security services are facing with the number of extremists here in the UK, elsewhere in Europe, they do a really professional job and, of course, they know many of these individuals, most of them who end up taking part in terrorist organisations. ‘They’d be more subject to criticism if someone came and committed an atrocity in this country or elsewhere who they had no knowledge of whatsoever. ‘They’re doing their professional job by being aware of these people. But there are probably several thousand of these individuals of concern and the numbers are rising as more people go to Syria and Iraq and are radicalised out there. ‘And no one is talking about rounding up all these people or keeping 100 per cent coverage, there’s just not the resources to do that and it would be contrary to our principles of human rights to do that…so you do have to find a balance in there.’ Sir John also dismissed claims the treatment of Emwazi by MI5 that may have helped radicalise him as ‘very specious arguments’. However, the counter-terrorism laws watchdog David Anderson QC said the intelligence agencies may have made a ‘slip-up’ in failing to impose tighter controls on Emwazi due to the sheer number of suspects they have to cope with. Mr Anderson said he was not surprised that Emwazi was not subject to measures such as house arrest, despite being on MI5’s radar, because the UK’s spies and counter-terrorism police were very busy. His warning came as Boris Johnson attacked ministers yesterday for scrapping control orders on terror suspects that could have prevented the murderer from slipping out of Britain to join Islamic State. Butchers: Heavily armed IS fanatics in Iraq. Security services fear their followers could use the same sort of weapons on Britain’s streets . In what was seen as stinging criticism of Home Secretary Theresa May’s decision to replace the orders – under which suspects are tagged and confined to specific areas – with less restrictive measures, the London mayor said: ‘What this shows is we need to keep a very, very close eye on these people. ‘The decision to modify the control orders, to water them down, I think looks as though it was a mistake because it is vital to be able, when you are controlling these people, to be able to relocate them, to take them away from their support networks and… to monitor them.’ Mr Johnson spoke out after it was revealed that Emwazi, 26, had been on the radar of the security services for six years as part of a support network for West London-based terror suspects and extremists, some on control orders. But these were replaced in 2011 by the Home Office – under intense pressure from the Lib Dems – with less restrictive Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims) making it harder to monitor movements of terror suspects. ‘The balance, the benefit of the doubt was, I am afraid, given too much to those who wish us serious harm,’ Mr Johnson said. Lord Carlile, the Government’s former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation, said Emwazi would have been placed under a control order. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘We warned the Government not to abolish control orders. TPIMs are too weak.’ Michael Fallon said he is 'worried' about the spread of ISIS, and the threat pop-up cells pose to the UK . Police forces may have to work more closely with the Army under plans to thwart ‘pop-up’ terror cells. Defence chiefs are investigating how troops could give back-up to armed officers and how military helicopters could be used to move police around the country in the event of a Paris-style atrocity. Special forces are already being prepared for urgent intervention against Islamic State fanatics, the Defence Secretary said yesterday. Michael Fallon added: ‘We are facing Islamic State in Syria and it is on the borders of Europe. It is becoming a very direct threat to Europe. 'We need to do something about it. I’m worried about the fight against IS, I’m worried about this spread of IS, this kind of pop-up IS, which can link up very easily. ‘The Home Secretary has been looking at how you can deploy sufficient numbers of armed officers in areas outside London. ‘And if they had an incident or two incidents or people fleeing from Manchester or London out to the countryside, do they really have enough armed officers to deal with that?’ He said that it was in those circumstances that the Army could be drafted in for large-scale operations, such as searching a forest or cordoning off a railway station.","Sir John says MI6 needs to strike balance in policing terror suspects .

"Facebook users who don't fit any of the 58 gender identity options offered by the social media giant are now being given a rather big 59th option: fill in the blank. 'Now, if you do not identify with the pre-populated list of gender identities, you are able to add your own,' said a Facebook announcement. Facebook software engineer Ari Chivukula, who identifies as transgender and was part of the team that made the free-form option, thinks the change will lead to more widespread acceptance of people who don't identify themselves as a man or woman. Facebook hopes the change will lead to more widespread acceptance of people who don't identify themselves as a man or woman . 'We're hoping this will open up the dialogue,' Chivukula said. Alison C.K. Fogarty, a gender identity researcher at Stanford University, said giving users control over the words describing their gender is a significant step in social recognition of a growing trans community, especially coming from the world's largest social media company. 'People are still fighting to make room for gender identity within the socially constructed binary of male and female,' Fogarty said. 'Labels and identities are powerful in that they give a sense of community, a way of articulating one's experience.' In February 2014, Facebook expanded gender identity from male and female to a list of dozens of options, including Androgyne, Gender Fluid, Intersex, Neither and Transgender. Those choices will all still be available. People who choose a custom gender can also choose the pronoun they would like to be referred to publicly: he/his, she/her or they/their. Facebook has a setting for users to control the audience who sees their gender. Last year's changes created an online stir, with thousands of comments — some grateful, others confused or hostile. The following are the 58 gender options Facebook previously offered: . Agender Androgyne Androgynous Bigender Cis Cisgender Cis Female Cis Male Cis Man Cis Woman Cisgender Female Cisgender Male Cisgender Man Cisgender Woman Female to MaleFTM Gender Fluid Gender Nonconforming Gender Questioning Gender Variant Genderqueer Intersex Male to Female MTF Neither Neutrois Non-binary OtherPangender Trans Trans* Trans Female Trans* Female Trans Male Trans* Male Trans Man Trans* Man Trans Person Trans* Person Trans Woman Trans* Woman Transfeminine Transgender Transgender Female Transgender MaleTransgender Man Transgender Person Transgender Woman Transmasculine Transsexual Transsexual FemaleTranssexual Male Transsexual Man Transsexual Person Transsexual Woman Two-Spirit . But staff at Facebook said there was full support to take it even further this year, from CEO Mark Zuckerberg on down. As of Thursday, the free-form option rolled out to U.S. users, while the custom gender identity option with a list of words was available in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Argentina and Denmark. One thing that has not changed is an 'interested in' option for Facebook users to define whom they might want to date. That option still only allows men or women, but users can click both options, one option or neither option. They can also hide it entirely. Last year's changes created an online stir, with thousands of comments — some grateful, others confused or hostile. Facebook, which has 1.23 billion active monthly users around the world, would not release how many users have chosen gender identity options beyond man or woman, citing privacy concerns and a general practice of not sharing user information. The Williams Institute, a think tank based at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimates there are at least 700,000 people in the U.S. who identify as transgender, an umbrella term that includes people who live as a gender different from the one assigned to them at birth. Sarah Kate Ellis, CEO and president of the advocacy group GLAAD, said that the past few years have brought 'real movement in trans visibility' and that Facebook has been a leader in making that happen. 'This helps to accelerate trans acceptance in our country,' Ellis said. 'I'm excited about the future for gender identity.'","Facebook overhauled system in 2014 adding 56 new options .

"A man from Sweden claims he has experienced death not once, but twice, and lived to tell the tale on Reddit. In an online 'Ask Me Anything' interview on Tuesday, Reddit user r00tdude, identified as Sasha Eliasson, shed light on what it feels like to be clinically dead. Mr Eliasson student was dead twice for about two minutes each time. Scroll down for video . Back from the dead: Sasha Eliasson claims he died for about two minutes on two occasions: once after a bike crash and another time after a surgery . His first 'passing' reportedly took place in June 2014 when he was involved in a motorcycle crash. Eliasson briefly 'died' a second time months later when he overdosed on painkillers following surgery. He described himself as a life-long atheist, said that both times he experienced 'just black emptiness' devoid of any thoughts of consciousness. The Redditor compared the ordeal to taking a 'short, dreamless nap,' and added that he only realized he had temporarily expired because the doctors were obligated to tell him. '""So yeah, you were dead for a couple of minutes, just fyi"" hahaha,' he wrote. Sasha Eliasson said that his goal in life now, post-death, is to have fun and make other people's lives better. Eliasson, who described himself as a life-long atheist, said that both times he experienced 'just black emptiness' devoid of any thoughts . 'No personal achievement will matter to me once I'm dead,' he told his fellow Reddit users. 'The only thing that will live on after my death will be my impact on the people that are still alive.' He revealed that dying twice has made it easier for him to cope with his mortality and accept the impending end as a given. ‘All you have to do is accept that death is what it is, a part of life, then you will understand that it is nothing to be afraid of,’ he said. 'Once you're dead, that's it, it's over.’ Last July, Eliasson posted an online message telling friends that on June 25, he was riding his motorcycle on a highway when he ran into a construction site, slammed on the brakes and lost control of his vehicle, suffering a broken knee, shin and ankle. According to Eliasson, his shattered body shut down from the intense pain, and for about two minutes he had no pulse, breathing or consciousness. Eliasson's second run-in with death came after a surgery. He claimed his body was in agony, so he took so many pain pills that his pulse plummeted to 10bpm and his respiratory system temporarily failed. ‘Both times I was just ""not there"". It was just all black. I would describe it as when you take a nap. A short nap with no dream, you wake up and it feels like you've been sleeping a long time, when in reality it's only been about 15 minutes,’ he recounted. Asked about what he felt the moment he died, the Reddit interviewee revealed that it was like as if someone had flipped the on/off switch. He added that both experiences felt roughly the same, with the only difference being that in the bike accident he remembered the seconds before everything around him went to black. Mr Eliasson also called into question the stories of other people who have reported being conscious during clinical death. 'I think that in their cases, their minds were still active. What they experienced was just a sort of dream.' Close call: Eliasson's first brush with death took place in June 2014 when he lost control of his bike and broke several bones. He says for two minutes, he had no pulse, breathing or consciousness . In the aftermath of Sasha Eliasson’s two close shaves, the college student said that he is no longer afraid to take risks in life - but he did give up on riding motorcycles for the sake of his family and friends. Eliasson told his fellow Redditors that being at death’s door before the age of 23 did nothing to change his views on God and religion. ‘I have always been an atheist, but I have always had a part of me that hoped there was a God or Heaven or something greater than us,’ he said. ‘I am still an atheist, and now I know that there is no such thing as God or Heaven. At least not for me. ‘ . He also expressed some strong views on the subject of organ donation, saying that he plans to give up his entire body to help other when his time finally comes. ‘I believe that it's super selfish to hold on to your organs when you have literally NO use for them,’ he declared. Asked about his attitude towards mortality, Elasson confided that he now fears death less than ever before. ‘I know now that death is nothing worse than sleeping. When you die, you just stop existing, nothing to worry about!’ he concluded.","Reddit user Sasha Eliasson claims he clinically died twice in the last year .

"A 1,000lb woman, once dubbed the 'half-ton killer' after she falsely confessed to accidentally killing her nephew, has lost 800lb. Mayra Rosales, from Texas, said she had given up on life when she decided to protect her sister Jamie and take the blame for the death of her nephew Eliseo in 2008. Rosales, 34, told police she had smothered the child by rolling on top of him, a claim  later disproved when autopsy results revealed the boy had died from multiple injuries to his skull. After her sister Jamie confessed to the crime and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mayra vowed to get healthier to take care of her sister's surviving children. Scroll down for video .

'Food to me is I have to eat to live,' she said. 'Before it was living to eat, and now you know, it's just something normal.' Houston surgeon Dr. Younan Nowzaradan said he could see Rosales was driven to make a change. 'Once you're in bed for several years, she had no life,' he said. 'Once she get up and walk and do things, you'll be amazed how motivated people become.'

She lost 100 pounds in her first 10 days. Rosales would have to lose 500 more just to get gastric bypass surgery. The newly slimmed down Rosales hasn't just seen a major change in her appearance. Her health has drastically improved as well. 'I'm not diabetic, I do not have high cholesterol, I do not have high blood pressure,' she told ABC's Nightline. 'Now I'm okay and my organs are perfect.' Rosales now has an active following on Facebook with over 18,000 fans, who she keeps updated as her transformation continues. Last month Rosales posted about another skin removal surgery, writing that 'my leg looks normal like any other' except for the scar she now has running from the back of her knee to her ankle. Rosales also invites fans who are struggling with their weight to inbox her if they'd like to receive health tips. On her Facebook Rosales also revealed that she and her husband Bernie, was shown in her TLC documentary when she was still 1,000 pounds, had gotten a divorce in 2013 because he wanted to move back to Mexico to be with his family.

Rosales had watched her sister hit Eliseo with a hairbrush on his arm, legs and head. The little boy died later that day from his injuries. Jamie begged Rosales to take the fall. 'I thought I was dying anyway so I decided to admit that I'd done it to protect my sister because I love her,' Rosales told the court during her trial. Rosales' trial became a media sensation. Cameras rolled as Rosales had to be cut out of her house and transported into a moving van to the court. Her attorney also bought a king-sized mattress so she could live in the courtroom while the jury decided her fate. Rosales later told ABC she was willing to give up her life for Jamie.

"This was the tumble that shook the internet, the fall that was bigger than the £5 million show itself, and quite possibly the ultimate wardrobe malfunction. After a 20-year absence from the Brit Awards, Madonna stooped to conquer — by falling off the stage. The extraordinary spectacle of the singer, worth £520 million, being thrown to the floor at the British music industry’s flagship award ceremony this week will surely go down as one of the most bizarre episodes in pop history. Scroll down for video . Madonna's a goner: The Material Girl doesn't shriek or grimace as she tumbles - and is there a trace of a wry smile on her lips? As she sang the lyrics from her new single, Living For Love, and reached the line, ‘Took me to heaven and let me fall down,’ she did indeed fall down — backwards down some steps, dragged by a backing singer tugging on her Armani cape. She was heard landing with a deep ‘thud’ by all sitting near the stage. For a moment, as the backing track continued to play, there was stillness and silence. And then the Material Girl, 56, rose, climbed the stairs again and resumed singing, completing her routine with remarkable aplomb. Sure, there was an extra kink in those Shirley Temple curls, and the vocals were not perfect, but, dignity aside, she seemed essentially none the worse for wear. And in getting up and embodying the ‘show must go on’ spirit, she was instantly lionised and hailed as an ‘icon’ by fans across the globe. Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw, a barometer of cool, tweeted: ‘Madonna come party with us — I’m gonna DJ — you can vogue. Everything will be fine. DO NOT BRING THE BLOODY CAPE.’ Indeed, far from a disaster, the incident has provided a welcome burst of publicity. In its wake, not only has #madonnafall been trending worldwide (bringing her to the attention of the internet generation who have not, until now, been buying her music), but her single Living For Love has shot to the top of the iTunes chart from its previous position well outside the top 100, while the British Phonographic Industry reported yesterday that sales of her greatest hits album, Celebration, rocketed by 62 per cent. And despite presenters Ant and Dec joking after the show that they were sitting with the star in A&E, the performer herself is absolutely fine. Actually, and this may seem curious, Madonna made such a speedy recovery that she was well enough to plug her album, and pay thanks to her fashion designer friends, immediately after the show. 1. Madonna begins her performance, dressed as a matador and flanked by dancers . 2. Her cape is tugged backwards by a backing singer, but the star seems unperturbed . 3. As she starts to fall, a dancer is already vaulting to the floor. Was it all choreographed? 4. As she lands, dancers are waiting crouched around the back of the podium . ‘Armani hooked me up! My beautiful cape was tied too tight!’ she wrote on Instagram. ‘But nothing can stop me and love really lifted me up! Thanks for your good wishes! I’m fine! #livingforlove.’ It’s enough to make one suspect that perhaps, just perhaps, this was a publicity stunt. Conspiracy theorists were yesterday pointing out a few key peculiarities. First, close examination of the footage shows that just before she fell she wasn’t frantically trying to unclasp the cape — which, you imagine, you would surely do if you knew it was about to be whisked off. Instead she had her hands at her waist when she fell. Photographs also show the star looked peculiarly calm as she tumbled; no grimaces or shrieks. Indeed, in some images, traces of a smile seem to be playing about those tight features. Madonna revealed a bare behind on the red carpet at the Grammys earlier this month . Unlike her performance at the American music awards, the Grammys, earlier this month, where she wore a buttock-baring corset, Madonna also favoured a sensible pair of three-quarter length trousers — which will have made for a slightly more comfortable landing. Perish the thought they were padded. Might she, then, have planned it? After all, the perfectionist that she is, Madonna had spent two full days rehearsing her routine and performance at the O2. Surely someone as thorough as she would have finessed the business of taking a cape off. Intriguingly, at the very moment Madonna toppled from the raised stage, the male dancers flanking her vaulted down, too, and artfully formed into a ring around her. Viewed on video, they do not seem to be rushing to help her — their movements suggest a choreographed sequence. Those whose faces are not obscured by bizarre horned masks do not appear unduly concerned. What’s more, other dancers could be seen already crouching around the back of the podium before Madonna fell, almost as if they meant to catch her. And what is to be made of the lyrics of the song? As fans have noted, they seem to defy mere coincidence. ‘Took me to heaven and let me fall down, Now that it’s over, I’m gonna carry on,’ she sang. ‘Lifted me up, and watched me stumble, After the heartache, I’m gonna carry on.’ Showbusiness veteran Rick Sky, who has spent decades covering Madonna’s performances, said: ‘You would have thought it would be easier for Madonna to just show her a** for publicity — but she did that at the Grammy’s, didn’t she? Perhaps this was all that was left. Stranger things have happened. She is such a perfectionist that you know she will have rehearsed every last second of that performance, which makes it seem even more unlikely that it could be anything but deliberate.’ It is a view shared by hundreds of Twitter users. One wrote: ‘Who else thinks the Madonna fall was planned?’ Another: ‘I think it’s staged. It gets a lot of publicity and sympathy.’ Musician George Bowie tweeted: ‘The more I watch that video, the more I think it’s the greatest PR stunt of all time. New single out & everyone talking about Madonna.’ But if it was a stunt — albeit one that perhaps went slightly awry, with the singer hitting the floor more heavily than planned — what did Madonna hope to prove by it? Oops she did it again! Madonna's attention grabbing smooch with Britney Spears in 2003 . Madonna pictured under cover - for once - in a niqab last year . A flash of the old Madonna on stage in Turkey, also in 2014 . If nothing else, observers say the brief break in her vocals showed that she was not miming — an accusation she has faced in the past — although a fairly strong backing vocal could still be heard. Publicist Mark Borkowski tells me: ‘This was a massively important night for Madonna and she had her whole international team there. It was a huge event, her first time at the Brits in 20 years. She will not have wanted anything to go wrong. She is very exacting. There was a lot riding on this performance after Radio 1 was accused of not playing her single. She needs to convince the Taylor Swift generation to buy her music. That was what her performance there was all about.’ Madonna pictured arriving at Annabel's Private Members Club in London last night . For Madonna has been suffering from a brutal law of diminishing returns when it comes to recent album sales. Her last studio album MDNA in 2012 sold a relatively measly 1.8 million copies worldwide — even though she’d worked with the hottest young producers and embarked on a publicity blitz. You have to rewind ten years to 2005 to find her last big hit album, Confessions On A Dance Floor, which sold 12 million copies. The signs are that her new album Rebel Heart is going to continue the slide. No wonder she was so desperate for attention at the Grammys. It must be acknowledged, however, that Madonna is the mistress of the publicity stunt over a 32-year career. Often hailed as the queen of reinvention, she is ruthless when it comes to scheming her next shock. A brief history of her greatest stunts includes countless displays of vulgar provocation, from the release of her ‘coffee table’ Sex book in 1992 to wearing a niqab in 2014 and baring her breasts again for a magazine last year. Even in the Guy Ritchie years — when she tried to reinvent herself as the respectable wife of a film director — she didn’t stop, kissing Britney Spears on stage in 2003. As she has aged, she has sought to portray some of the attention-seeking as a bid to fight ageism — a sort of grey crusade with porn imagery thrown in. She said: ‘They’re judging me by my age. I don’t understand. But I don’t follow the rules. I never did, and I’m not going to start.’ As she says in this month’s Rolling Stone magazine: ‘My nature is to provoke, that’s true. I can’t help myself. But it’s always with good intentions.’ Her good intentions in London this week are probably best defined as intending to do herself some good. But the question is, was this the publicity addict’s most desperate stunt yet? Strictly no win no fee, of course! Beware: Possible publicity stunt ahead . All aboard the stairlift to the stars .

"It's official: we are a nation of Sauvignon Blanc fanatics. The dry white white has been revealed as the most popular tipple in almost every British town, city and county, a new study has shown. It also revealed that Glasgow has the greatest penchant for Grenache, Bournemouth likes painting the town red with Merlot and Malbec and Chardonnay comes out tops in Berkshire. The research was conducted by British wine merchants Laithwaite's Wine, which polled more than 400,000 of its customers. Analysing more than a hundred grape varieties and wine regions, Laithwaite's Wine found that Sauvignon Blanc came out on top with only Berkshire bucks the trend, drinking more of our second favourite grape, Chardonnay. Drink up! Britons love their Sauvignon Blanc . The dominance of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay in the UK paints only half the national picture however as a closer look at the figures reveals that our wine tastes are far more varied and diverse . Studying the wine orders of each town and city in the UK reveals that Glasgow has the greatest penchant for Grenache, with the highest proportion of bottles sold here. Bournemouth is painting the town red with the highest percentage sales of Merlot and Malbec. Residents of Hammersmith and Fulham are keeping Beaujolais Nouveau fashionable, Rosé is most at home in Ramsgate and Slough leads the way in enjoying a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. When it comes to sparkling, Liverpool came out on top as the city with the highest percentage of Prosecco drinkers. Unsurprisingly, Champagne flutes are filling up most frequently in the City of London and Westminster. Beth Willard, Wine Buyer at Laithwaite's Wine says: 'It's great to be able to draw up the first 'Grape Britain' wine map. 1. Sauvignon Blanc . 2. Chardonnay . 3. Merlot . 4. Cabernet Sauvignon . 5. Shiraz . 6. Grenache . 7. Pinot Noir . 8. Tempranillo . 9. Pinot Grigio . 10. Malbec . 'What it shows is that, while Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay have a huge nationwide appeal, we are actually a nation of wine connoisseurs, with our own unique tastes and preferences, and a willingness to be adventurous in our selection. 'We've seen a slight shift in the nation's palate over the last few years to wines made from lesser known varieties and from less mainstream regions. 'Wines from Romania and Hungary are becoming more popular than traditional favourites like Italian Pinot Grigio. Sauvignon Blanc's dominance at the top of that list might soon be challenged.'

"A university job application form has sparked fury in Ireland after it emerged candidates were being asked about their menstrual cycle. Questions on the form, issued by the National University of Ireland Galway, included ‘do you suffer with menstrual periods?’ and ‘do you suffer any breast problems?’, it has been reported. The content of the ‘pre-employment health assessment’ has been described as ‘totally outrageous’ while a politician has called for an independent review into equality issues at the college. Questions on the form, issued by the National University of Ireland Galway (pictured), included ‘do you suffer with menstrual periods?’ According to RTE, female job hunters were asked: ‘Have you ever been treated for gynaecological problems?’ The form also asks whether candidates have had prostate problems in the past. The university has defended the questions, insisting the answers are ‘completely confidential’ and not seen by human resources. But RTE quotes Sinn Féin’s Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh as calling the content of the form ‘invasive’ and ‘bordering on misogynistic’. Calling for an independent review by Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, he added: ‘I think it is a very invasive line of questioning to be asking any future employee. I think some of the questions are totally out of order. The content of the ‘pre-employment health assessment’ has been described as ‘totally outrageous’ while a politician has called for an independent review into equality issues at the college (file picture) ‘As some commentators in the college have said they're bordering on misogynistic in some cases.

The form is in line with forms used for employment purposes. ‘The form is completely confidential and returned by the individual to the university Occupational Health Physician directly.

"U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder says the government has been constantly 'thinking about' and 'working on' ways to capture or kill British-raised ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John'. 'I think there is something to be said for holding accountable (and) getting at the people who are responsible for these barbaric acts,' Holder said in an interview with ABC News. 'The vow that I can make to the American people, along with our allies, is that we will hold accountable all of the people who have been responsible for these heinous, barbaric acts. 'That is something that we are focused on each and every day.' Scroll down for video . Attorney General Eric Holder said the U.S. is focused on stopping the British-raised ISIS executioner, who on Thursday was named as Mohammed Emwazi (right) However Holder refused to confirm the identity of the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria, who has finally been named as London man Mohammed Emwazi. 'It would cut back any of the operational possibilities we have been considering,' he told ABC. On Thursday, President Obama  also spoke somewhat cryptically on the action being taken to track down the man responsible for beheading several hostages, but said it would 'take time'. 'Eventually, if you hurt an American, you are going to be brought to justice in some fashion,' Obama told KOMO-TV. 'I'm confident we will get the job done. It will take a little bit of time but in the end, this death cult that has developed there ... is a dead end.' British Prime Minister David Cameron also vowed to take Jihadi John 'out of action'. On Thursday, Jihadi John was unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi. Kuwaiti-born Emwazi moved to Britain as a six-year-old child – and quickly embraced British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United. Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. After finishing primary school in 1999, Emwazi moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John's Wood, where he is believed to have studied alongside former X Factor judge and pop star Tulisa Contostavlos . Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress, and his sisters began to wear the hijab. In August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania where they were picked up by MI5 – who accused him of planning to travel to Somalia to join the militant group Al Shabaab. Mr Cameron said: 'When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens we will do everything we can with the police with the security services with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.' The PM said this was his 'number one priority'. The ISIS executioner Jihadi John was finally identified as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi on Thursday . Mohammed Emwazi pictured at St Marys School, first row, second from left, after moving to Britain from Kuwait . Mr Cameron said: 'I work very closely with our security services. I meet with them regularly, I ask them searching questions about that they do – and in my almost five years of experience as Prime Minister I think they are incredibly impressive, hardworking, dedicated, courageous and affective at protecting our country. 'All of the time they are having to make incredibly difficult judgements and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf.

"Two teenage sisters died and two other children were hospitalized after a relative found all four unresponsive Friday from a carbon monoxide leak in their western Ohio home, officials said. Sisters Dionanna Bishop, 14, and Dejah Bishop, 13, died in an emergency room, said Dr. William Ginn, the acting Miami County coroner. He said the likely cause of death is carbon monoxide poisoning.

The coroner said the children were believed to be sleeping in the same bed when they were overcome by carbon monoxide from what police officials believe was a malfunctioning furnace or heater. Long said it is believed the children were all related, possibly cousins, and lived in the house with their grandmother. He said the grandmother had been hospitalized with pneumonia, and the children had been home alone, which is why another relative came to check on them Friday afternoon. The relative reported that the children had been sick for days and now would not wake up.

Meanwhile the Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman adds that detectives are attempting to verify the recovered dress is the same one Nyong'o wore. 'We do have possession of a dress that greatly reassembles the dress that was stolen but I don't think at this time we can 100 percent say it's that dress, but it greatly resembles it,' Nishida said. One of the actress' representatives reported the dress was stolen from Nyong'o's room at the London Hotel in West Hollywood late Wednesday. Authorities said it could have been taken during a broad time frame earlier in the day. Authorities placed its value at $150,000, although experts say it could have fetched more on the black market. A special dress: The custom Calvin Klein gown reportedly featured 6,000 pearls and was taken from Lupita's room at the London Hotel sometime on Tuesday . The recovery of the dress was first reported by celebrity website TMZ, which wrote in a post that a person claiming to have taken the gown gave them information about where to find the dress. The dress recovered on Friday afternoon was found in an abandoned bathroom at the London Hotel, sheriff's officials wrote in a press release, after it was believed to have been thrown off the balcony. Nyong'o won an Oscar in 2014 for her role in Twelve Years a Slave and was a presenter at Sunday's ceremony. Her publicists declined comment on Friday evening. The 31-year-old actress has become a darling of Hollywood's red carpets in the past two years, with commenters and fans praising her fashion choices. She accessorized the dress with Chopard diamond drop earrings and three Chopard diamond rings. Before the awards ceremony, Nyong'o told The Associated Press on the red carpet, 'I'm just wearing my diamonds and pearls. My homage to Prince,' referring to a popular song by the musician. 'There are a lot of collectors out there who are very private and have private collections of stolen merchandise,' said style expert and fashion commentator Mary Alice Stephenson. 'Some of these dresses have global fame as big as any Van Gogh.' Scene of the crime: TMZ reported that the dress was likely taken from The London Hotel between 8am and 9pm while the actress was out on Tuesday . The dress had been reported missing on Tuesday, with Lupita telling police it must have been taken from her room between 8 am and 9 pm, while she was out. The London also confirmed the incident, saying: 'This is a terribly unfortunate situation, and we are working with law enforcement on their investigation.' On Wednesday the actress shared a timelapse video of her pre-Oscars prep which shows her with her style team in her hotel room getting her glammed up  before the big event. And the morning after the Oscars, Lupita shared a snap of her beautiful accessories she'd worn for the night and captioned: 'That was cool! #Oscars 2015 #DiamondsAndPearls' Laid out on top of her frock were some stunning Chopard jewels and satin Nicholas Kirkwood heels alongside a silver box clutch. Lupita returned to the Oscars after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress last year for her work in 12 Years A Slave. 'This year the pressure's off,' Lupita told E! host Ryan Seacrest during the E! red carpet show. She added: I can just dress up and enjoy the show' The actress was recently attached to the film Queen Of Katwe based on the true story of Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi.

"British jihadi brides are being groomed online using a phone app run by extreme left-wing activists, the Mail can reveal. After they are brainwashed on Twitter, Islamic State recruiters tell the young girls to communicate with them using a messaging programme called Surespot. The app – run by privacy and drug legalisation campaigners in Colorado – is designed so messages are totally encrypted and cannot be intercepted by authorities. Scroll down for video . Flight to terror: Clutching their luggage, the three teenage friends prepare to board a flight to Istanbul . When messages are deleted by the IS member, they automatically also erase from the phones used by the British teenagers so no trace of the incriminating conversation is left. Surespot’s owners, who have made an estimated £140,000 in revenue since it launched in 2013, insist it is protecting an ‘essential liberty’ and has no responsibility to stand in the way of IS. The app is available for free on internet stores run by Apple and Google and known jihadists direct teenagers to download the software using public profiles on Twitter. Yet none of the technology giants appear to have acted to crack down on people using the app to speak to jihadists. Surespot is run from a suburban house in Boulder, Colorado, by environmentalist Cherie Berdovich and Adam Patacchiola, a hacker who appears to be her partner. 'Groomed': Shamima Begum (right) is thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female IS fighter. She later flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey with friends Kadiza Sultana, left, 16, and Amira Abase . Last night, Surespot’s owners did not respond to requests for comment, while Google and Apple declined to speak. It comes as three London schoolgirls are feared to have fled Britain to join ISIS, boarding a flight to Turkey before slipping into neighbouring Syria. Today, it emerged that police spoke to Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15, just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised . They are the latest schoolgirls, Bethnal Green Academy in east London, to go missing are feared to have fled to Syria to become Jihadi brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and 'brainwashed in their bedrooms'. They walked out of their homes last Tuesday before strolling through security checks at Gatwick Airport and flying to Turkey. Police fear their goal is to reach the terror stronghold of Raqqa where they face being married off to foreign fighters. On Sunday, a Twitter account appearing to belong to Shamima tweeted to an account associated with female ISIS member Umm Layth, formerly known as Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow in November 2013 .

"Former National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden was heckled at the Conservative Political Action Conference after he called himself an 'unrelenting libertarian'. Hayden was at the conference on Friday for a debate with Fox News senior judicial analyst and libertarian judge Andrew Napolitano, which was moderated by Fox Business Network's Lou Dobbs. At one point in the debate, Hayden, who also used to head the CIA, said: 'Let's talk about facts. The judge is an unrelenting libertarian.' His comment was followed by a large applause from the audience. But when he added, 'So am I', the crowd booed and laughed, with many people shouting 'No, you're not!' Scroll down for video . Former NSA and CIA chief Michael Hayden (right) debated the rights of the Fourth Amendment with libertarian judge Andrew Napolitano (left) at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday. Hayden was heckled after claiming that like Napolitano, he, too, was an 'unrelenting libertarian' All applause from the conservative audience stopped as Hayden gave reasoning into why he considers himself a libertarian. 'I am an unrelenting libertarian who's also responsible for four decades of his life for another important part of [the Constitution], the part that says ""provide for the common defense,""' he said. The majority of the conservative audience members appeared to support Fox News analyst Napolitano's viewpoints (file photo) Hayden's comments came after Napolitano told the audience they should be 'outraged' by NSA's surveillance programs, first revealed in 2012 by whistleblowers including Edward Snowden. Napolitano warned the crowd that the government had the power to turn on people's phones, read texts and listen to conversations. 'We are in a twilight era where freedom is diminishing,' the judge told the audience. Hayden said in his followup: 'If NSA were even capable of doing what the judge has outlined for you we wouldn't have be having a debate here today. There would be nothing to argue about.' Later into the debate, Napolitano asked the former NSA chief: 'Does the head of NSA have the constitutional legal authority to move the line between privacy and surveillance?' Several audience members began yelling 'no', and Dobbs turned to Hayden, telling him the crowd response was 'a clue how they'd like you to answer'. 'The accusations fit on a bumper sticker but reality takes a little bit longer,' Hayden said, going on to say that while targeting foreigners, the NSA is required to withhold information collected about US citizens, according to the Daily Dot. 'So in other words, foreign terrorist, ""Abu Akmad bin Bad Guy"" was talking to a known US person. We minimize the US identity to protect your privacy, unless of course, the identity of the US is absolutely essential to the intelligence value of the intercept in the first place,' he said. Hayden downplayed NSA's spy programs throughout the debate while side-stepping Napolitano's  main claim - that seizing an American's property unreasonably, through correspondence and data, without probable cause, violates the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. Hayden failed to respond to Napolitano's main argument, that seizing an American's property without probable cause violates the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. The former NSA  chief has said in the past that privacy is a line that people must 'continuously negotiate' At one point, Hayden said the debate was 'beginning to feel like an away game'. This is not the first time Hayden as spoken out about the NSA, rights of privacy and hacking. In January during a speech at Washington and Lee University, the former chief discussed what constitutes as a probable search under the Fourth Amendment, according to The Atlantic. Hayden said that Americans have a duty to reveal their ingoing and outgoing calls as well as their internet activity. 'Privacy is the line we continuously negotiate between ourselves as unique creatures of God and ourselves as social animals,' he said. 'In the first category we have a right to keep things to ourselves. And in the second category we have a responsibility to reveal things about ourselves to the community for the greater good.'","Michael Hayden was debating with libertarian judge Andrew Napolitano .

"An Egyptian court has sentenced four members of the Muslim Brotherhood to death and the banned group's leader to life in prison. Mohamed Badie was one of 14 members sentenced to life, alongside his deputy Khairat El-Shater and leading Brotherhood figure and lawmaker Mohamed El-Beltagy. Mr Badie and Mr El-Beltagy both showed their defiance at the verdicts, gesturing behind the heavy screens of their cages to cameras in the Cairo courtroom. Scroll down for video . Leading Muslim Brotherhood figure Mohamed el-Beltagy gestures from the defendants' cage during his trial at the non-commissioned police officers institute in Cairo. He was sentenced to life in prison . Supreme Guide of the banned  Mohammed Badie cries out in defiance during his sentencing today .

The case stems from violent clashes near the Muslim Brotherhood's headquarters on June 30, 2013 . The case stemmed from clashes near the group's headquarters on June 30, 2013, four days before the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. The fighting left 11 people dead and 91 wounded. The men were accused of murder and possession of firearms, among other charges. Other key figures sentenced to life include party head Saad el-Katatni and his deputy, Essam el-Erian. Four lower-level members of the Brotherhood were sentenced to death for inciting the violence in June 2013. Two of those sentenced to death and three sentenced to life were tried in absentia. The death sentences are subject to appeal and many of the defendants are already serving lengthy sentences on other charges. Once the top leader of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, Badie has already been sentenced to multiple life terms, and was one of hundreds given the death sentence in a mass trial that drew international criticism of Egypt's judicial system. Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's leaders, as well as non-Islamist activists swept up by police during protests.

Police in the Cairo courtroom.Some 22,000 people have been arrested since Morsi's ouster, including most of the Brotherhood's leaders, as well as non-Islamist activists swept up by police during protests . Egypt's former Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Mohammed Mahdi Akef looks on during today's trial at which the group's current leader Mohamed Badie was sentenced to life over the deaths of protesters who stormed the group's Cairo headquarters in June 2013 . President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who as army chief toppled Morsi, describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat. The movement says it is committed to peaceful activism. The same day another Egyptian court listed the Palestinian group Hamas as a terrorist organisation, judicial sources said, part of a sustained crackdown on Islamists in the most populous Arab state. Hamas is an offshoot of the Brotherhood, which the authorities have also declared a terrorist group in Egypt and have repressed systematically since the coup against Morsi. While a court ruled in January that Hamas' armed wing was a terrorist organisation, Saturday's broader ruling against the entire group has potentially greater consequences for the already strained relationship between Cairo and Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip on Egypt's border. 'The Egyptian court's decision to list the Hamas movement as a terror organisation is shocking and is dangerous, and it targets the Palestinian people and its factions of resistance,' Hamas said in a statement after the ruling. 'It will have no influence on the Hamas movement,' Hamas said. After the January decision against Hamas' Qassem Brigades, a source close to the armed wing signalled the group would no longer accept Egypt as a broker between it and Israel. Cairo has for many years played a central role in engineering ceasefires between Israel and Hamas, including a truce reached between the sides in August that ended a 50-day Gaza war. A spokesman for the Egyptian government declined to say what actions the government would take to enforce the ruling. 'When a final judgment is issued, we will discuss this,' Hossam al-Qawish said.","Mr Badie joined by leading Brotherhood figure Mohamed El-Beltagy .

"The author of House of Cards has accused the BBC of 'organisational and intellectual arrogance' and said it is run 'more like a private fiefdom than a public service'. Lord Michael Dobbs, who wrote the novel turned into series for the BBC and Netflix, said: ‘There is a real danger of the BBC being brought low by a hundred headlines, a thousand unnecessary taxi rides, and millions that have been spent on redundancies and failures. He said the Corporation is one of Britain's most important cultural exports, and a 'prime weapon' in its 'arsenal of soft power'. Lord Dobbs, speaking at the Huw Wheldon Memorial Lecture, said the BBC risked being undermined by embarrassing spending scandals and its failure to own up to its mistakes . But, according to Lord Dobbs: 'That doesn't mean giving the BBC a blank cheque, or refraining from giving it a good kicking when it deserves it, but it does mean making sure it has the opportunity, and the encouragement, to meet its ambition of doubling its global audience to half a billion people in the next seven years. 'A vibrant system of public service broadcasting that is part of our future, not just a glorious past. 'If we didn't have the BBC, how much would we be willing to pay, to invent it? 'The BBC is a little like the monarchy. Impossible to measure how much she earns for the country, but we know it's immense.' Delivering the Royal Television Society's Huw Wheldon Memorial Lecture, Lord Dobbs warned that the BBC's standing is being undermined by embarrassing spending scandals, and its failure to own up to its mistakes. 'There is a real danger of the BBC being brought low by a hundred headlines, a thousand unnecessary taxi rides, and millions that have been spent on redundancies and failures,' he said. Robin Wright  (left) and Kevin Spacey in the Netflix series House of Cards, based on Lord Michael Dobbs' novel . 'There's a sense amongst many opinion formers that the BBC … has too often in recent years slipped into both organisational and intellectual arrogance. The criticism in many instances is well-founded. 'It's often very, very good at news. Equally often, it's terrible at self-criticism….It ducked away from broadcasting its own inquiries into the Savile scandal, leaving that to ITV.' Lord Dobbs, a former chief of staff for the Conservative Party, wrote House of Cards in 1989. It was adapted for the BBC a year later, before being reinvented by Netflix as a big-budget series starring Kevin Spacey. During the lecture he also accused the BBC of a left-wing bias in some of its reporting. 'Too often and for too long the BBC has implied that anyone who wanted to question immigration policies must be racist,' he said. 'The BBC has an institutional bias in favour of the European Union and all its works,' he added. 'It has taken sides in an ongoing debate. That's been acknowledged in report after independent report.' Earlier this month, Huw Wheldon's reputation as one of the BBC's most respected broadcasters was tarnished, after a book claimed he regularly molested women.","Lord Michael Dobbs wrote the novel turned into series on BBC and Netflix .

"A drug lord whose Knights Templar cartel once terrorized a region of Mexico has been captured and paraded in front of cameras following a huge intelligence operation. Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, a former grade-school teacher who taunted authorities and once led an organisation which wreaked havoc across the western state of Michoacan, was arrested on Friday. Authorities swooped in on the 49-year-old kingpin as he left a house in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan, along with eight bodyguards and associates toting a grenade launcher, three grenades, an Uzi machine pistol and assault rifles, National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido said. They were taken without a shot fired after a months-long intelligence stakeout, in which Gomez's associates were identified when they gathered for his birthday February 6 with cakes, soft drinks and food. Scroll down for video . Captured: Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, a former grade-school teacher who once led an organisation which wreaked havoc across the western state of Michoacan, was arrested on Friday was seen landing in a Mexico City airport . Paraded: Authorities swooped in on the 49-year-old kingpin as he left a house in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan. He was then dragged to a helicopter in front of waiting press . Family associate: Flavio Gomez, brother of Servando Gomez, aka 'La Tuta', is also dragged away from another helicopter at an airport in Mexico City . Rubido said the key break came months ago when agents identified one of Gomez's most-trusted messengers, a group of people who apparently supplied him with food, clothing and medicine when he earlier hid out in the remote mountains of his home state. Gomez's quasi-religious criminal band once exercised what Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong called 'absolute control' over Michoacan. It orchestrated politics, controlled commerce, dictated rules and preached a code of ethics around devotion to God and family, even as it murdered and plundered. But the cartel lost power when the federal government took over the state to try to restore order in January 2014 after vigilantes began fighting the gang. Other Knights Templar leaders were captured or killed over the past year as authorities kept up the hunt for Gomez, who had a $2 million bounty on his head. Pena Nieto's government, which took office a little over two years ago, has been aggressive in capturing drug lords, including the biggest capo, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, a year ago. Head down: Flavio was sat inside the helicopter. His brother had is believed to have had a $2million bounty on his head . Transfer: Masked federal police stand next to an armored vehicle carrying the drug kingpin on Friday . In all, 10 top leaders of various cartels have been captured or killed in the last six years, six of them under Pena Nieto. Of Mexico's top criminal leaders, only Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada of the Sinaloa Cartel remains at large. 'We are advancing, we are responding, we are having major apprehensions of the most wanted, most dangerous criminals,' Pena Nieto said Friday, congratulating and thanking the federal forces that helped apprehend Gomez. 'Overall, we continue to work toward a Mexico of peace that we all want.' Crime will only shift around as the now weakened cartel regroups, or even splinters, as has happened with some of Mexico's drug gangs after the killings or capture of top leaders. Others continue business as usual after top leadership hits. 'Dismantling them was a necessary step, but that does not end the problem of insecurity,' Alejandro Hope, a Mexico City-based security analyst, said of the Knights Templar. 'The next part is more complicated. There are still small groups, remnants, which will be extorting, robbing and perhaps even producing methamphetamine.' Response: Despite a huge armed presence, Gomez and eight associates were taken without a shot fired following a month-long intelligence stakeout . But the arrests, even those hitting the powerful and international Sinaloa Cartel, seem to have had little effect on the flow of drugs. Seizures at the U.S.-Mexico border have fluctuated since 2010, when 2.7 million pounds were seized, to a high of 3.1 million in 2011 and down to 2.3 million pounds in 2014, according to U.S. government figures, the only way to estimate flows of drugs. 'It's a dangerous proposition to suggest Knights Templar is dismantled,' said David Shirk, associate political science professor at the University of San Diego. 'It may take six months or a year, but this is a group of illegal actors that has staying power. Their roots go back to `80s and `90s. They just had different stages. The names change and the leaders change, but the problems in many ways persist.' Indeed, the Knights Templar grew out of the La Familia cartel, where Gomez started out transporting marijuana before becoming a top leader about a decade ago. The cartel initially portrayed itself as a crusader gang, protecting communities from the Zetas cartel. Witnesses said La Familia trained its recruits in ultra-violent techniques like beheading and dismembering victims, and it frequently ambushed soldiers and federal police. Escort: Federal police officers stand on the back of pick-up trucks leaving the Assistant Attorney General's Office for Special Investigations on Organized Crime (SEIDO) in Mexico City following Gomez' capture . The government hit La Familia hard, starting in the administration of President Felipe Calderon in late 2006. Officials declared the cartel beaten in 2010 after allegedly killing its leader, Nazario Moreno. But La Familia fled to the neighboring states of Guerrero and Mexico, where it now fights other regional gangs for control of the lucrative and growing heroin trade. Moreno, who actually hadn't died, then started Knights Templar with Gomez and took an even stronger hold on Michoacan. After Moreno was finally killed last year and Gomez going on the run, the Knights Templar too is now operating in Guerrero, at least in the city of Ciudad Altamirano, extorting protection payments from small business owners. The brother of one pharmacy manager, who insisted on not being quoted by name out fear of reprisals, said all the stores in town were paying annual 'quotas' ranging from 5,000 pesos ($335) to 30,000 pesos ($2,000) for the right to operate. They were threatened with violence, kidnapping or the burning of their stores if they didn't pay. 'I have the impression that this is another detention of no judicial consequence,' Edgardo Buscaglia, a cartel expert and senior scholar at Columbia University, said of Gomez's arrest. 'It's only meant to reorder the map to reach a Mafioso kind of peace outside the justice system to improve the image of the administration of Enrique Pena Nieto.' In Morelia, newspaper vehicles rolled through the streets with loudspeakers announcing a special edition about Gomez's arrest. 'It's very good news that they have detained La Tuta, but I don't know if it will solve Michoacan's problems,' said Jesus Osorio, a taxi driver. 'There will still be crime.'","Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez once terrorized the western state of Michoacan .

"New research sheds fresh light on the deadly toll of tobacco showing the an astonishing two-thirds of smokers will die early from smoking-related health issues. The new Australian research, published by BMC medicine, showed that doctors had a low estimate of smokers who die from their habit and that the actual figure was roughly 67 per cent. The earlier you put your cigarettes out permanently, the better your chance of avoiding those illnesses. New research shows smoking is even more deadly than guessed, and that only 10 cigarettes a day can double a smoker's risk of fatal disease . 'The relative risks of adverse health effects increase with increasing intensity of smoking,' said the study,' 'measured by the amount of tobacco smoked per day, and with increasing duration of smoking.' Smoking can lead to elevated risk for at least 13 different cancers. The Washington Post reports that 10 cigarettes a day will double the smoker's risk of death while a pack quadruples the numbers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 42.1 million Americans smoke cigarettes, a habit which remains the number one cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. At least one in five of the country's 480,000 annual deaths can be tied to smoking. 'We knew smoking was bad, but we now have direct, independent evidence that confirms the disturbing findings that have been emerging internationally,' Emily Banks, the study's co-author and a researcher at the Australian National University, said upon releasing the findings. Smoking remains the top preventable cause of disease and death in the United States . The study examined a pool of more than 200,000 people. And more than just the obvious health impact, there's a financial burden as smokers run up about $6,000 more annually in health care costs and productivity than their smoke-free counterparts for their employers. Smokers tend to require an average of 40 per cent more in health care costs, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. There have been multiple initiatives to get smoker to quit, from banning smoking in bars and restaurants and parks to tax hikes. Its estimated that about 30 per cent of adults below the poverty line smoke with only 16 per cent of those at or above that level taking up the habit.","The new Australian research, published by BMC medicine, showed that doctors had a low estimate of smokers who die from their habit and that the actual figure was roughly 67 per cent .

Scientists in Dresden have found a single single gene that may be responsible for the large number of neurons found uniquely in the human brain. When this gene was inserted in the brain of a mouse embryo (pictured), it caused the formation of many more neurons (stained red) Scientists believe the gene arose in humans after our ancient ancestors and those of chimps split from the same evolutionary path more than five million years ago. Known as ARHGAP11B, the gene contributes to the reproduction of basal brain stem cells, triggering an increase in the number of neurons in the neocortex. This is a brain region that is central to reasoning, language and sensory perception. The researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics isolated different subpopulations of human brain stem cells and identified, which genes are active in which cell type. Scientists believe the gene arose on the humans after our ancient ancestors and those of chimps split from the same evolutionary path more than five million years ago.Known as ARHGAP11B, the gene contributes to the reproduction of basal brain stem cells, triggering an increase in the number of neurons in the neocortex. They noticed the gene ARHGAP11B, which is also found in our closest relatives, the Neanderthals and Denisova-Humans, but not in chimpanzees. Around 3.8 million ago, our ancestors Australopithecus afarensis,  had a brain that was 30 cubic inches (500 cubic centimeters) in volume. About 1.8 million years ago, Homo erectus had a brain twice the size of Australopithecus afarensis. When Neanderthals and Denisovans arrived, the brain had grown to 85 cubic inches (1.4 litres) in volume. Despite this increase in size, scientists believe human's intelligence may have more to do with how brain cells form that how large the brain grows. Tests on mouse embryos revealed that the gene can have a huge impact on brain development. Embryos injected with the gene grew larger brain regions and some developed the wrinkled surface characteristic of the human brain, allowing more tissue to fit into the skull. 'It is so cool that one tiny gene alone may suffice to affect the phenotype of the stem cells, which contributed the most to the expansion of the neocortex,' study lead author Marta Florio at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics told LiveScience. But it is likely this gene is just one of a large number of genetic changes that make human intelligence unique, she added. Around 3.8 million ago, our ancestors Australopithecus afarensis,  had a brain that was less than 30 cubic inches (500 cubic centimeters) in volume. About 1.8 million years ago, Homo erectus had a brain twice the size of Australopithecus afarensis. When Neanderthals and Denisovans arrived, the brain had grown to 85 cubic inches (1.4 litres) in volume. Despite this increase in size, scientists believe human's intelligence may have more to do with how brain cells form that how large the brain grows. The team now wants the mice to grow into adults while carrying the gene to see if it improves their intelligence.","The ARHGAP11B gene increases the number of neurons in neocortex .

"Held at an 'art gallery' near London's Euston station, it was one of the most extraordinary and nauseating press conferences of recent times. It had been convened at 3pm on Thursday by the 'human rights' organisation Cage following the identification of masked killer Jihadi John as the Kuwaiti-born Londoner Mohammed Emwazi. For three years, the campaign group had been in close contact with and offered support to Emwazi before he left Britain to fight in Syria in 2012. But rather than express an apology – or even a smidgen of regret – for having failed to turn him away from the path to barbarism, what we witnessed was almost an hour of excuses, accusation and invective against Britain, British society and the British state. Broadcast live for 52 minutes on the BBC and 58 on Sky News, the men from Cage described Jihadi John as an 'extremely kind' and 'beautiful young man'. Scroll down for video . For three years Cage had been in contact with and supported Mohammed Emwazi before he escaped to Syria, but rather than offer an apology or regret at a press conference yesterday, they defended him . The lachrymose assessment of his character was made by the organisation's 'research director' Asim Qureshi, who spoke uninterrupted for 18 minutes about the iniquities of British policy on the 'war on terror' and the unfair 'harassment' that men such as Jihadi John experience. The heavily-bearded Qureshi is a very middle-class radical, who lives with his partner in a £500,000 house in suburban Surrey. Despite these trappings of infidel decadence, he has advocated jihad and the creation of an 8th-century-style Islamic Caliphate in Britain, similar to that which has been imposed in Syria and Iraq by the terror group IS. In 2006, Qureshi was filmed outside the US embassy in London addressing a rally organised by the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. He said: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. 'We know that it is incumbent upon all of us, to support the jihad of our brothers and sisters in these countries when they are facing the oppression of the West. Allahu akbar! Allahu akbar!' In a subsequent interview with the pro-Putin broadcaster Russia Today, Qureshi supported the imposition of Sharia law, including the stoning to death of adulterers and other brutal capital punishments. This week, his opening harangue at the press conference was followed by Cage's 'media officer' Cerie Bullivant, a British convert to Islam. He railed for another eight minutes about the treatment he had received at the hands of the security services 'in very similar circumstances' to those of Emwazi. Bullivant, a 32-year-old former mental health nurse once married to a Kuwaiti-born woman, went on the run for two months in 2006 after being placed under a control order when it was suspected he was planning to go to Iraq to fight for insurgents. He was later cleared of breaching the condition by a jury which accepted he had a 'reasonable excuse' for flouting the order because it was making his life miserable. The civil rights organisation Liberty was sufficiently 'impressed' by his subsequent campaigning to award him a 'human rights young person of the year' award in 2011. Cage's research director Asim Qureshi lives in a £500,000 house in Surrey with his wife, but once took part in a demonstration calling for Jihad . The third member and 'moderator' of the press conference panel was John Rees, a former leading activist of the Socialist Workers' Party. His position is a good example of how the hard-Left has aligned itself with radical Islam. Rees is national officer of the Stop the War Coalition and presenter on the Islam Channel, through which he fostered close links with Cage. The group first appeared in 2003, when it was known as CagePrisoners. It was founded to oppose official Western policy on the 'war on terror' and to stand up for Muslims who were arrested, captured or killed in security operations. Critics say it was – as we witnessed on Thursday – a sophisticated organisation that knows how to exploit a democratic system which enshrines free speech and human rights in order to support terrorists. This is not a view, though, taken by two of Britain's largest left-of-centre charitable foundations, which saw CagePrisoners as a human rights cause worth supporting and donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to. Some £120,000 was given by the Anita Roddick Foundation, which is run by the late Body Shop owner's husband and their children. Funds from her estimated £100million estate have been given to a range of bodies that 'want to change the world'. This definition would seem to include an organisation that wants Britain to become a medieval caliphate. A further £305,000 was given to CagePrisoners/Cage over a period of six years by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, a Quaker-run fund set up by the York-based chocolate maker and philanthropist. Quite why the trustees support such a body is a question for their consciences. Probably, it is also a question for the Charity Commission to look into. Sources at the Commission believe officials at the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust may have been 'duped' when they agreed to make donations to Cage. One said: 'They were conned after it re-branded itself as a human rights group.' He said Cage (and its previous entity CagePrisoners) had been well-known to the security services for some years because of its support for terrorists. Cage has also worked closely with two other UK-based organisations that have reported ties to Islamic extremists – the Cordoba Foundation and the Emirates Centre for Human Rights (ECHR). Cage came to wider attention in 2006 when Birmingham-born Moazzam Begg joined it as 'outreach director'. He had been arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and spent three years at Guantanamo Bay where he claimed to have been interrogated 300 times. He admitted having visited terror training camps in Afghanistan but was awarded £1million compensation by the British Government. Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo Bay detainee, joined Cage in 2006 as 'outreach director' and began campaigning for the release of Al-Qaeda cheerleader Anwar al-Awlaki . After his release without charge, he has since become a columnist for the Guardian. Through Begg, Cage developed links with the radical preacher and Al Qaeda cheerleader Anwar al-Awlaki and campaigned for his release from detention in Yemen. He was later killed in an American drone strike. In 2010, Begg also spoke of his desire for a Caliphate-style regime in Britain. As for Cage, it is a mystery why it has escaped scrutiny for so long. Significantly in 2010, a director of the campaign group Amnesty International was suspended by the organisation for talking out of turn. Gita Sahgal had criticised its close ties with Cage – which she described as 'jihadis' – and with Begg, who she called 'Britain's most famous supporter of the Taliban'. Last year Begg was arrested over alleged links to terrorism training and funding in Syria, to which he had previously travelled. As a result, Cage's bank accounts were frozen after intervention from the Treasury. Although the charges against Begg were later dropped, it seems from the organisation's website that its accounts are still frozen. In the meantime, Cage asks for donors to send money online to a website more often used for receiving charitable sponsorship – or to send cash by recorded delivery to an address in Bloomsbury, central London. It also advises: 'We can arrange for someone to pick up the cash donation from you.' Cage continues to have a phlegmatic view of British jihadis fighting in Syria. One article posted on its website last year was headed 'British fighters in Syria should not concern us', which undoubtedly could be seen as encouraging or justifying terrorism. Indeed, the 'human rights' outfit described the first British suicide bomber in Syria, Abdul Waheed Majid, from Crawley, as 'giving his life for a just cause, and it would be shameful of us were we to tarnish him and other Syrian fighters as terrorists for doing that'. Omar Deghayes, a Libyan citizen who was a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, has also been listed as a director of Cage. Two of his nephews were killed after travelling from their Sussex homes to fight in Syria. For their part, British security services fear the rise of an Islamic State terrorist threat in Britain is helped by the sympathetic campaigning of 'human rights' groups such as Cage. As an eminent former counter terrorism officer says: 'The outlook is very, very gloomy – far worse than it was after 9/11. And it is not helped by organisations such as Cage being basically apologists for slaughter.'","Cage held a press conference yesterday to discuss identity of Jihadi John .

"Adrift in the Channel, closer to France than England and home to its own language, Guernsey is perhaps one of the most mysterious corners of the British Isles. Measuring just 24 sq miles, this tiny British outpost, officially French-speaking until 1948, also braved invasion by the Nazis in World War Two. This year sees the 70th anniversary of the island’s liberation. On May 9, Guernsey will mark the closure of one of the most difficult periods in its recent history. Adrift in the Channel, closer to France than England, Guernsey combines the best of both nations with its own unique twist . This year sees the Channel Islands celebrate 70 years of the liberation, which took place on May 9, 1945 . As visitors flock to witness the cavalcades and celebrations, they will discover a quaint, beautiful island, all rugged cliffs, soft sand beaches and rolling green hills in the interior – a throwback to another time. But Guernsey doesn’t just look backwards. Among the B&Bs, tea rooms and crab sandwiches served up at windswept coastal spots, there are some exciting new developments. Checking into the four-star Duke of Richmond Hotel is about as far from quaint as Guernsey gets. You could almost be in New York. The Duke of Richmond hotel adds a touch of New York-style elegance to the island's accommodation offerings . Bold prints, luxury textiles and some very quirky chandeliers lend the hotel a somewhat urban edge you wouldn't expect on the island . For the first time ever this year, the Channel Islands will hold its first pan-island Heritage Festival. Running from April 3 to May 11, it will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the islands’ liberation from the occupying German forces during WWII. During the festival there will be special openings of the bunkers, observation towers and even the underground towers used by the occupying forces during the war and visitors will be able to take part in themed walks to learn more about the only part of the UK invaded by Nazi Germany. Visit visitchannelislands.com . Boutique, boisterous and beautiful, this revamped hotel welcomes guests with a sleek monochrome foyer filled with quirky adornments, from a suit of armour to a dramatic black chandelier. A sumptuous afternoon tea display stands, tempting me to stay in and indulge in cakes and sandwiches from stylish leopard print plates. For those who want to indulge, you can walk straight into the moody, low-lit bar, where beige and black striped chairs and huge high-backed leopard print seats are scattered around glass tables and cocktails are the order of the day. Upstairs, the rooms are just as quirky, but with a little less leopard print. Beiges, reds, dark greens and blues are the themes of the rooms, with striped wallpaper, patterned carpets and big cushioned beds. They are opulent retreats, with chandeliers, artfully-designed mirrors and sleek bathrooms – exactly what you need after a day of fresh air and coastal walks. Perched on a hill above Saint Peter Port, the hotel sits at the corner of Cambridge Park, where a statue of Victor Hugo watches over the locals. The writer spent 15 years in exile on the island, 14 of which he lived at the elegant white-washed Hauteville House in the capital, penning his masterpieces. From leopard to stripes, careful thought has gone into the clashing prints which dominate the communal areas in the hotel . And on warm sunny days, guests can take the plunge in the pool, which feel like it belongs in the Mediterranean more than the Channel . You can visit today and learn more about the genius behind Les Miserables, where ornate rooms decorated in rich reds and golden trim seem to contrast with the simple beauty outside the building. But beyond literary greats, the island has plenty more to offer. I am lucky enough to happen upon golden sunshine and warm temperatures, with just a blustery breeze to blow away the cobwebs. It is the perfect weather to explore the coastline, from sweeping sandy beaches to craggy cliffs and everything in between. You can walk the whole circumference of Guernsey and each year outdoors-lovers take part in hosted Round The Island walks. Walking along Guernsey's coastline, its tempestuous history as an island much fought-over is hard to ignore thanks to its stark defences that still stand proud looking out to sea . I’m more interested in the Tasty Walks designed by the tourist board to combine interesting routes with great local spots for good food. I eschew pub snacks in favour of a slice of gâche – Guernsey-style fruit bread – to keep me going as I stroll out and around Jerbourg, the southeastern tip of the island. To help plan your trip, visit the Guernsey Tourist Board website www.visitguernsey.com . Doubles at the Duke of Richmond hotel starts at £145 per night including breakfast. dukeofrichmond.com 01481 726221 . Return flights from London Gatwick to Guernsey start from £79 return with Aurigny. aurigny.com 01481 822886. You can't wander far in Guernsey without stumbling across its war defences. The island suffered during World War Two. It was attacked by air, with the first raid on June 28, 1940 killing 33 islanders and injuring a further 67. Thankfully, around 4,000 people - mainly children - had been evacuated in the months before the attack. The German Occupation began two days later, on June 30, and lasted for almost five years later, when the island was finally liberated on May 9. Bulky concrete blocks, built as observation points on the tops of cliffs, and bunkers built into the ground, still stand today - a stark reminder of the suffering of islanders. It gives the feeling of Guernsey constantly on the lookout for where the next enemy will come from. Of course, not all defences are from the Second World War, the island has its fair share of forts, towers and watch-houses dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries, a reminder of Gurnsey's very strategic position in the Channel between old enemies France and Britain. But it's not all memories of war. Quaint villages look like they have stepped straight out of story books, church spires stand out against rolling hills and in spring time wildflowers turn the land into a kaleidoscope of different colours. Victor Hugo spent 14 years living at Hauteville House in St Peter Port whilst penning his masterpieces . Drive along the narrow roads and you'll happen upon 'hedge veg' all over the place - old bookshelves or tables set up with local produce and honesty boxes. It certainly beats going to the supermarket. And after a day of bright sunshine and crisp temperatures, it seems the perfect time to retreat back to my sumptuous lodgings for a warming meal. A glorious roast dinner is served up on Sundays at the Duke of Richmond, in a black and white tiled conservatory filled with light and looking over a deep blue pool, which must see a lot of use in the summer months. The hotel manager, Paul Brady, a charming man who has lived on the island for nearly thirty years, knows everything and everyone you need in Guernsey. He pops from table to table as we tuck into our glorious roast, surrounded by families, romantic couples and even a tour group of Americans. Paul may not have been born in Guernsey but he seems an islander through and through - immensely proud, devastatingly charming, with one foot in the past and bright ideas for the future.","Measuring just 24 sq miles, this tiny British outpost braved invasion by the Nazis in World War Two .

"A gang of thieves used a JCB digger to smash through a wall at HSBC and steal an ATM - before being caught just 24 minutes later. The three men, who had stolen the vehicle an hour before yesterday's raid, tore into the bank branch leaving a gaping hole in the building and pieces of brick and metal scattered across the pavement. The snatched machine was then loaded on to a black truck, which the gang used to flee the scene near Hull, East Yorkshire. Smash and grab: The raiders stole the JBC vehicle from a farm before using it to ram an HSBC branch and extract the ATM machine near Hull, East Yorskshire . But the raiders were caught at 3.24am by Humberside Police officers just 15 miles from the bank. Residents in the small village of South Cave were woken by the deafening noise of the building being repeatedly rammed and immediately called the police. Melinda Clark, the owner of a newsagents next to the bank, said: 'It was completely unexpected and I don't think anyone can believe it has happened. 'This is a quiet, sleepy village – things like this don't happen to us. People are very shaken up. 'There were lots of witnesses, people heard what happened and were looking out of their windows but they were too scared to do anything.' A resident who lives nearby, but asked not to be named, said she alerted the police shortly after 3am. The JCB was repeatedly rammed into the building, leaving a gaping hole in the wall and bits of brick scattered across the pavement . She said: 'It's the most scared I have ever been in my entire life. 'I was woken up by a huge banging and looked out the window to see three men in balaclavas ramming this vehicle into the side of the building. 'They must have driven into the bank about ten or 20 times and the noise was horrendous. I called the police straight away but I was in complete shock and couldn't believe my eyes. 'It has caused a lot of people to worry. It's made me very frightened because I was home alone with two children so I was scared for them, too.' Less than an hour before the raid, the JCB was stolen from a farm in the nearby village of Riplingham, East Yorkshire. The owner of the farm, who did not want to be named, said he did not know the vehicle had been taken until he received a visit from police. He said: 'It isn't difficult to get to South Cave from where we are, so they must have broken in overnight and taken it.' A police spokesman said: 'Police are aware of other similar incidents in the Yorkshire region and are trying to establish whether there are any links to this incident. 'The public are urged to remain vigilant in areas where there are ATMs and report any suspicious behaviour to the police by calling 101, especially in rural locations.' Last night, the men remained in custody and were assisting police with their enquiries. A HSBC spokesman said the bank suffered substantial damage and would take several weeks to repair. She said: 'We already have contractors working at the scene to make the building safe, but, unfortunately, we expect it will have to remain closed several weeks. 'We are committed to reopening the branch as soon as we can.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Gang stole vehicle from a farm  before raid attempt in small village near Hull .

"A Russian writer has been criticised after her kitten reportedly died of toxic blood poisoning just months after it was painted shocking pink for a party. The kitten allegedly ingested too much of the colour and died from toxic blood poisoning a few months later, vets said. According to local media the pink colour had poisoned the young cat after she had made it the main attraction at a pretty in pink party last September in which all of the guests had to wear pink. But Ms Lenina claimed on Instagram that it was a hairdresser who painted the kitten and said the cat was happy and healthy when she gave it to a new owner shortly after the party.

She said: 'The pink colour was especially chosen for its healing properties and also strengthens the cat's hair. 'A vet told me it was a beneficial addition.' Ms Lenina, who is also an actress and model, posted a YouTube video on her Twitter page showing off the cat after the event. Alongside the clip she wrote: 'Friends, look at the pink kitty.'

"Ruth Palmer,25,  had her identity stolen by a con artist . A married 25-year-old has spoken of her horror after her life was stolen by a mystery woman in a bid to attract unsuspecting men. Ruth Palmer found that nearly 1,000 of her images and real details about her life had been used to set up a host of Twitter and Instagram accounts. The 25-year-old discovered the 'catfish' -  an Internet scammer who fabricates online identities and entire social circles to trick people into romantic relationships - had been using her details for three years. Using the fake name Leah Palmer she duped two men into believing they were in a relationship with the brunette. The imposter even set up fake accounts for her mother and friends to make the social media profiles appear more realistic. When Mrs Palmer complained to the social networks, they shut down the accounts. But just days later, more false profiles  were set up. Mrs Palmer, who is married and from Brighton, East Sussex, now fears the perpetrator has become 'obsessed' with her life. 'It is horrible and I just can't understand what must be going through this person's head to do this,' she said. 'It has been horrific for me, my family, friends and husband. 'I am now fearful of whoever this is as they are seemingly not able to stop this and nothing seems to deter them. Scroll down for video . 'I feel violated and completely invaded and would very much like this to be broadcast to as many people as possible as this could be happening for many, many others. 'Circa 900 images and videos of my own personal experiences had been taken from my own social media accounts, some from five years back.' 'Now this maybe sounds fairly average given the social media society we live in today, however the imposter had gone even deeper than what I had originally thought when I looked into it further. The mystery scammer, who goes by the name Leah Palmer,  has stolen pictures and personal details from Ms Palmer . Ms Palmer from Brighton, East Sussex, now fears that the scammer is 'obsessed' with her personal life . 'I found the person held a two-and-a-half-year online relationship with someone whom they spoke to every night on the phone, text messaged and exchanged emails with. 'It was a massive web of deceit.' When Mrs Palmer found the false profiles, she immediately contacted the victims, which includes a golfer and a DJ, to warn them of the scam. She also called a mobile number that the imposter had been giving out to her victims. But she claims a woman who answered simply hung up the phone and the number is now out of use. Mrs Palmer added: 'The victims were horrified when I told them the person they'd been speaking to wasn't who they said they were. The social media accounts reappear days after they are shut down by sites . 'I have spoken to around five or six different men who have been involved with her but unfortunately since they are all in the public eye, they want to remain anonymous. 'I also found the imposter had been making online friendships with other girls pretending to be interested in their lives. 'Disturbingly they also created a fake social media account of my friend using my friend's real name and started having conversations between both the imposter and the 'friend' account. 'My mum, who is a psychologist, says the catfish must be really troubled in the head.' But it is the catfish's knowledge of her personal details that Miss Palmer finds most troubling. She said: 'They told people that 'Leah' lived in Brighton and had moved to Dubai recently and that she had two brothers and a cat called Misty, whilst using all the genuine lives of my social group of friends as her own. 'All of which are true accounts of my own life. ''Leah' also said my genuine friends were her friends and gave accounts of where she had been with them and spoke about events she had been to with them.' Mrs Palmer complained to Sussex Police but her case was referred to Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and internet crime.. The service is run by the City of London Police, who work alongside the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau. But Action Fraud said there has been no criminality. Merryn Hockaday, of Action Fraud, said: 'Ruth Palmer's case has been 'no crimed' by the Crime Registrar and the report will now be classed as an information report. Ms Palmer said that the con woman has so far duped a golfer and a DJ using her images and personal information . 'Information reports are not investigated by the police, but they are kept on record and used for intelligence purposes. 'This means the case will be kept on record to help inform intelligence. 'It may be, that in the future, a similar report comes in and criminal activity has taken place, the reports could be linked somehow, by suspect, location etc and it could help to inform the intelligence for that investigation.' Mrs Palmer added: 'I just want people to be aware of what can happen online. You never know what's going on - and what a profound affect something like this can have on your life. 'It's crazy. I genuinely don't feel like it has actually happened but sadly it really has and the situation keeps unravelling where more and more people have been duped by this imposter for either online friendships or online relationships. 'It's scary the length to which the imposter has gone.'","Scammer stole Ruth Palmer's identity to trick strangers into relationships .

"A former banana importer who was involved in a fatal drug-fueled threesome has been sentenced to up to four years in prison after beating his girlfriend of six months to a pulp at their New York home. Thomas Hoey Jr, 46, the wealthy owner of now-bankrupt Long Island Banana Corp, 'brutally attacked' Alison Bretherick, 29, at their Manhattan apartment in 2012, then tried to conceal the evidence. After the 'vicious' assault, Miss Bretherick was left bleeding from the scalp, unable to hear in one ear and with a red and swollen face. She also suffered several chipped teeth, court documents state. Attack: Thomas Hoey Jr (left), 46, the wealthy owner of now-bankrupt Long Island Banana Corp, 'brutally attacked' Alison Bretherick (right) at their Manhattan apartment in 2012, then tried to conceal the evidence . Despite her injuries, the victim defended her millionaire boyfriend in court, pleading with Judge Daniel Fitzgerald for mercy on his behalf. 'I miss him every day,' she said in an emotion-choked voice. However, apparently unmoved, Judge Fitzgerald handed down the maximum sentence to Hoey - who had previously been convicted  of third-degree assault and tampering with evidence - on Friday. He sentenced the defendant to up to four years in prison, and also extended an order of protection aimed at keeping him away from Miss Bretherick for five years, the New York Daily News reported. The sentencing comes just a month before Hoey is due to be sentenced in a pending federal court matter for giving cocaine to a woman, who later died, during a three-way hotel sex romp in 2009. In the latter case, Hoey faces up to 11 years for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruction of justice relating to the incident at Manhattan's ritzy Kitano Hotel. He allegedly delayed a call for help when 41-year-old mother-of-two Kimberly Calo collapsed on the floor and started frothing at the mouth after overdosing on cocaine at the $700-a-night venue.. Threesome: In March, Hoey is due to be sentenced in a pending federal court matter for giving cocaine to Kimberly Calo, who later died, during a three-way hotel sex romp in 2009. Above, Hoey has been accused of pressuring the other participant in the sex romp, Nicole Zobkiw (pictured), his then girlfriend, to lie in court . Luxurious: The millionaire banana mogul faces up to 11 years for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to suborn perjury and obstruction of justice relating to the incident at Manhattan's ritzy Kitano Hotel (pictured) Hoey, who was dubbed the 'Banana King' by the media after Miss Calo's death hit the headlines in 2012,  admitted to providing the high-quality cocaine to the personal trainer during the romp. He has also been accused of pressuring the other participant in the threesome, Nicole Zobkiw, his then girlfriend, to lie in court. Miss Zobkiw has since died of a suspected cocaine overdose. In Friday's beating case, Hoey entered the courtroom in handcuffs, winking at Miss Bretherick before she made a plea for mercy on his behalf to Judge Fitzgerald, denying that he had assaulted her. 'My life and city was taken from me along with my happiness of living with my boyfriend,' Miss Bretherick, a former University of Pennsylvania swimmer, told the court in a tearful voice. Death: Hoey allegedly delayed a call for help when Ms Calo (pictured), a mother of two, collapsed on the floor and started frothing at the mouth after overdosing on cocaine at the $700-a-night venue . She added that the court process has left her 'abused, disregarded and disrespected - none of which Tom makes me feel.' Hoey then told the judge: 'I love Alison and I would never hurt her.' But sentencing Hoey, Judge Fitzgerald said he had shown no remorse, saying: 'The assault was vicious. There was blood and at the time, the defendant lied to the police about how it happened.' He added: 'Moreover, I believe he influenced Miss Bretherick to lie to them also.' Miss Bretherick had only been with Hoey for six months when she was subjected to the assault. Court documents state a neighbor called 911 after hearing cries on March 30, 2012. Before police arrived, Hoey tried to clean up blood leading from an apartment door to a stairwell. During an interview with police, Hoey reportedly told officers, who saw his girlfriend's red and swollen face on the day of the attack, that the blood had come from him picking his nose. At Friday's sentencing, Assistant District Attorney Laura Millendorf said there was undeniable physical evidence that Miss Bretherick had suffered facial and head injuries during the beating. 'The back of her head laceration was bloody, fresh and deep when they arrived,' Ms Millendorf said. 'It was so deep, in spite of the fact that she showered and was attempting to hide the laceration, they could see it from across the room.' She added: 'This assault was brutal and his attempts to cover up this crime are equally as serious.' Hoey was previously alleged to have beaten Miss Bretherick so often and so viciously that she once scribbled on the back of a photograph, 'If you find me dead, Thomas hoey did it'. Under the limited protection order, Miss Bretherik is able to contact and visit Hoey behind bars.","Thomas Hoey Jr, 46, beat girlfriend Alison Bretherick, 29, to a pulp in 2012 .

"Three people have been diagnosed with leprosy in Florida and some of the cases are thought to be linked to armadillos. Health officials in Volusia County said that the cases are not related, though two of those who have been diagnosed with Hansen’s disease, or leprosy, since October had been in contact with nine-banded armadillos. The incubation period for the disease can run up to 10 years, so the armadillo exposure did not have to be recent, Dr. Paul Rehme of the Volusia County Health Department told WESH. Scroll down for video . Three people in Volusia County, Florida, have been diagnosed with the skin disease leprosy (right) and two cases are thought to be due to contact with nine-banded armadillos (left) (file photos) About 95 per cent of people have a natural immunity to the bacteria carried by the leather-shelled mammals. Wild armadillos 'are a large natural reservoir for M. leprae,' a 2011 study in the New England Journal said of the animal's relationship to the microbe. The study said that armadillos in the eastern US do not have the disease like their brethren in southern states such as Texas and Louisiana, though that could change as the populations continue melding together. Armadillo chili and other dishes based off of the animal are popular in southern states such as Texas. Eating armadillos presents a higher risk for contracting leprosy than touching them. The animals do not naturally have leprosy, and the disease was brought to America by settlers from Europe. The illness causes skin lesions and nerve damage, but is easily treatable. Flordia's current patients are responding well to their antibiotic treatment. Scientists use armadillos such as those in the southern United States to test treatments for leprosy (file photo, Louisiana, 1989) First signs of the disease in humans include ulcers, muscle weakness and eye problems. It later causes growths and claw-hands. In contrast to images of leper colonies from the Bible, current forms of the disease are not very contagious if caught early. There are about 100 cases of leprosy reported in the US each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Armadillo chili and other dishes based off of the animal are eaten in southern states such as Texas. Most Americans who contract leprosy pick up the disease while abroad., and it is more widespread in India, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa. About 250,000 cases that occurred worldwide in 2008. Armadillos are only found in the Western Hemisphere. Scientists have begun using the animals to test for leprosy treatments.","Three people in Volusia County diagnosed with leprosy since October .

"A New York news station committed a major nerd-foul on Friday. Rather than putting heads in toilets or giving flag pole wedgies, WABC-TV did something much worse to nerds everywhere: identified Mr Spock as a Star Wars character. Amid news coverage of the recent death of actor Leonard Nimoy, 83, who played Spock in 'Star Trek,' the news station tweeted and pushed an alert through its mobile app saying that the actor starred in 'Star Wars.' Oops! New York's WABC-TV news station tweeted and pushed an alert through its mobile app saying that Leonard Nimoy starred in 'Star Wars.' The alert read: 'BREAKING NEWS: Legendary 'Star Wars' actor Leonard Nimoy passes away at age 83.' Recognizing its mistake, the news station sent a new alert  correcting the inaccuracy. Though the snafu was corrected, the damage was already done. A photo of the mobile alert surfaced online and was quickly passed around social media online. As Spock himself taught, 'Insufficient facts always invite danger.' And so it did. The photo received more than 100 shares as Facebook users flooded the comment section with critical memes. Face palm: One Facebook user commented on the photo with this meme of two 'Star Trek' characters holding their faces in disapproval . 'Journey:' The news station posted a follow-up tweet to its correction wishing the actor a 'journey free of incident . Of course, the news station deleted the inaccurate tweet and, not only did it tweet the correct information, but a follow-up tweet said 'RIP' to the actor and wished the 83-year-old a 'journey free of incident.' Nimoy died at his Los Angeles home Friday after a battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The actor became an iconic figure with his portrayal of Spock, a logic-driven, half-alien science officer in the Star Trek television series and movies.

"Scores of young Roma women have been paraded before potential suitors at a Bulgarian 'bride market' where poor families are given the chance to arrange financially beneficial marriages for their children. Here the potential brides are provocatively dressed, donning gobs of mascara and wearing flashy jewellery, towering heels and mini-skirts. And surrounding them in the car boot-like sale event are young men whose family hope to find them a wife at a good cost. Scroll down for video . Roma boys and girls chat during the open-air 'bride market' in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria . A girl checks her makeup using a broken mirror at the market, where girls are displayed before prospective suitors . The market, which is held four times a year, is an opportunity for parents to catch up on gossip as well as play matchmaker for their sons and daughters . The families gathered in Stara Zagora are part of a community of about 18,000 Roma known as Kalaidzhi, who traditionally make a living as coppersmiths. They are among the most poverty-stricken people in a deeply impoverished region and seek to forge mutually beneficial unions that will help them weather Bulgaria's economic downturn. The 'bride market' - held four times a year on various religious holidays during the spring and summer - is a chance for the Roma's nomadic tinkers to meet and not only catch up on gossip, but also play matchmaker for their adolescent sons and daughters. Boys and girls dance side-by-side on the cars in a rare opportunity that flouts the community's conservative values, in which youths are rarely allowed to mingle with the opposite sex. Kalaidzhi, who are almost all devout Orthodox Christians, are known to remove girls from school at 15 or even earlier to keep them safe from temptation. A young girl with two gold teeth grins as she interacts with other teenagers at the open-air market . A Roma woman hugs her daughter as she speaks with a boy. The event is held four times a year and is extremely popular with teenagers among the Orthodox Christian commmunity . A young Roma girl wearing a dress smiles as she wanders through the market with her friends . It starts, like a high school dance, with groups of boys and girls in separate clumps, occasionally shaking hands and checking each other out - while mothers and fathers stay discreetly in the background. Apart from these twice-a-year bridal fairs, boys and girls only have contact in Internet chats. The event's reputation as a 'bridal market' goes back generations. It used to take place in a muddy open field next to a horse-trading market in a small village, where brides-to-be stood on stage with suitors competing for their hand. But police last year moved it into a city to avoid tension with the horse traders. Still, the flirtations which occur can lead to negotiations and a possible union a few months down the road. A group of Roma girls chat as parents (pictured far left and right) watch on . Milka Minkova, 13, poses with her husband Ivan Ankov, 17, at the event which is commonly known as the 'bride market' If the youths warm to each other, the fair can trigger complex financial negotiations about the price a young man's family must pay to a woman's parents if they are to be married. The cost of a bride - between 5,000 and 10,000 lev (£2,200 to £4,300) - has dropped in recent years as jobs have dried up. And wedding festivities are much more modest with cash so tight. But prices are said to still rise for a 'very beautiful' young woman with many suitors.","Teenage girls are matched up with future husbands at the 'bride market'

"A dozy car thief was knocked clean out after he tried to steal a new Mercedes coupe from outside a pub by throwing a brick at the driver's side window which bounced back, striking him in the head. The thief was found lying in the road near the Pheasant Bar by the pub's owner who automatically assumed that the man had been injured in hit-and-run.

"Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) has revealed how the government is looking to step up defence in the UK in the event of an attack . The defence secretary has said rapid-reaction squads of special forces will be drafted in to help police tackle terrorist attacks in the UK. Michael Fallon said yesterday that the military will help police to respond, particularly in rural areas where there are a limited number of armed police officers. The plans aim to stop the threat from a ‘pop up’ Islamic State cell carrying out a Charlie Hebdo-style attack in the UK. Mr Fallon said Britain needed ‘to do something about’ the spread of extremists, adding that special forces would be drafted in 'swiftly' in the event of an attack. He said  a joint review by the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office is looking at where soldiers should be positioned in the event of a crisis in the UK. They are also investigating how army helicopters could be used to move police around the country in the event of a Paris-style atrocity, he added. Home Secretary Theresa May has previously admitted ‘stepping up’ security measures to tackle a Charlie Hebdo-style attack in Britain. Mr Fallon said: ‘We are facing Islamic state in Syria and it is on the borders of Europe, it is becoming a very direct threat to Europe. We need to do something about it. ‘I’m worried about the fight against Isil, I’m worried about this spread of Isil, this kind of pop up Isil which can link up very easily.’ Mr Fallon added that in the past the military's emergency response forces, which include Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service, were focused on events outside the UK. In January it emerged that ministers were examining plans to have ‘anti-terror’ batallions stationed across the country to respond to a terror attack within minutes. The defence secretary's stark comments after Mohammed Emwazi (pictured left) a 26-year-old London graduate was unmasked as Jihadi John (right), the knife-wielding Islamic State fanatic . The plans aim to stop the threat from a ‘pop up’ Isis cell carrying out a Charlie Hebdo-style attack in the UK - pictured are French special forces and armed police working together following the January attack . ‘It is really looking at where our troops are deployed around the UK,' he said. '[Before] most of our efforts were looking outwards - it was all about being ready to go, to leave the UK.' ‘It wasn’t really inward facing. We are now looking at how we defend the UK and how we help the police do that - how they are deployed and whether there is a role for them [the military] in supporting the police.’ His stark comments come just days after Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, 26, was unmasked as Jihadi John, the knife-wielding Islamic State fanatic. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) has admitted ‘stepping up’ security measures to tackle a Charlie Hebdo-style attack in Britain . When asked what the country was doing following the Paris attacks in which 17 people were killed, he said: ‘The Home Secretary has been looking at how you can deploy sufficient numbers of armed officers in areas outside London. ‘She’s discovered the Met has got lots of armed officers and some of the others like Manchester have, but there aren’t huge numbers of double crewed armed response vehicles in rural forces. ‘If they had an incident or two incidents or people fleeing from Manchester or London out to the countryside, do they really have enough armed officers to deal with that? 'And if three terrorists disappeared into a big forest, how would they deal with that? 'You can see where they might call upon us.’ The search for the Charlie Hebdo gunmen in France was hampered when the murderers fled into a deep forest. It is understood defence chiefs will also look at the response times of the SAS, and how to move them even more quickly. UK counter-terrorism officers have long been braced for an attack by marauding gunmen following the Mumbai attacks which left 166 people dead in November 2008. Millions have been spent upgrading the heavy weaponry available to armed response teams and more officers have been trained - including a squad of 100 with automatic weapons within the British Transport Police. The government has also bolstered overall security in Britain’s rural communities. Security Minister James Brokenshire told MPs that specialist joint police, ambulance and fire teams were ‘in place with the capability to respond to terrorist attacks’. He also said plans were in place to protect Britain’s ‘most critical infrastructure’ against terrorist threats, including reservoirs, sewage plants, communication masts and electrical substations.

"The autopsy of a 17-year-old girl who was killed by Denver authorities disproves the police department's claim that she was driving at the officers when she was shot, according to her family. Jessica Hernandez suffered four gunshot wounds and had marijuana and a small amount of alcohol in her body when she was killed on January 26. Two bullets entered through the left side of her chest and traveled to the right side of her body. A third bullet traveled from her left pelvis to her right thigh, according to the report. Qusair Mohamedbhai, the family's attorney, said this proves Hernandez was shot from the driver's side of the car. He says this contradicts officers' claims that they killed Hernandez as she was driving directly toward them. Scroll down for video . The family of Jessica Hernandez, 17, said a new autopsy report disproves the Denver police department's claim that she was driving at the officers when she was shot and killed . Hernandez was shot twice in the left side of her chest and once in the left pelvis. The family attorney said this proves that she was shot from the driver's side of the car . 'The wound path and trajectory of the bullet that likely killed Jessica Hernandez undermines the version of events as indicated by the Denver Police Department,' he said in a statement. Mohamedbhai said the autopsy was 'objective evidence' that proved Hernandez was not to blame 'for her own death'. Hernandez also had abrasions on her nose and chest that were received postmortem, according to the report. Mohamedbhai said they confirm the police department's 'inhumane treatment' of Hernandez. Witnesses said officers pulled Hernandez from the car and handcuffed her even after she was motionless. It is not clear how many times she was shot, as the report states two of her gunshot wounds may have been caused by one bullet. Retired Colorado police chief and use-of-force expert Dan Montgomery said other factors needed to be considered and that conclusions couldn't be drawn from the autopsy report alone. He said it still needs to be known how the officers were positioned, what they tactics were in approaching the car and whether they put themselves in danger. 'It's like putting a giant jigsaw puzzle together, and we've got two tiny little pieces,' he said. 'More are going to start coming into place.' The Hernandez family has requested an independent autopsy. Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg . Mrs Hernandez said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.' 'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.' Police have said the two officers involved in the shooting, Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, fired after Hernandez drove a stolen car into one of them. Jordan suffered a fractured leg. Both officers are currently on administrative leave, which is standard procedure following an officer-involved shooting. A passenger in the car disputed that account, saying police opened fire before the vehicle struck the officer. Police have admitted no one in the car, which contained five people, was armed. A passenger in the car, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot. The passenger said officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside. Mrs Hernandez criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot. She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,' A passenger  in the car said Jessica (pictured left and right) lost control of the vehicle  after being shot . A shrine in remembrance of Jessica's life was set up at her family's home. She leaves behind five siblings . The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially-charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City. Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras. District attorney spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said the case was still ongoing and she could not offer a timeline on when the probe would be complete. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy. The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury. Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire. It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.' Mrs Hernandez criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot. The autopsy showed she received abrasions to the face postmortem .

"It was deja vu all over again for President Obama and his outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. Eyes glistening with tears, Obama bid an affectionate farewell to Holder Friday for a second time, but this tribute came with a soulful surprise. 'Eric is really just milking this departure thing for everything that it's worth,' Obama quipped at a Justice Department ceremony to unveil the outgoing Cabinet member's official portrait. 'I mean, golly.' But even Obama got upstaged this time. Scroll down for video .

VIP guest: Aretha Franklin, the 'Queen of Soul,' made an unannounced appearance at the ceremony . After the president and the attorney general had concluded their remarks, Aretha Franklin, the 'Queen of Soul,' made an unannounced appearance in the Justice Department hall. Holder, stunned, genuflected to the 72-year-old 'Natural Woman' songstress dressed in a festive shimmering outfit. And Franklin stepped behind the lectern to sing America the Beautiful with an homage to Holder, who was visibly moved by the gesture. The Daily Caller repoorted that as Franklin approached the podium to sing, Obama rushed to her side and handed her a stepping stool with the words, 'Hold on, Queen.' According to multiple published reports, Franklin later gave the president a first bump. In his own remarks, Obama noted Holder's six-year tenure as the third-longest serving attorney general. Holder also is the first African-American man to hold the job. 'I know it felt even longer and I'll just come out and say it. He's been one of our finest,' Obama said. We're not worthy: Holder genuflected to the veteran entertainer, while Obama smiled on the sidelines . Belting out: The 72-year-old 'Natural Woman' singer performed America the Beautiful with an homage to Holder . Moved: The famously stoic commander-in-chief became emotional as he listened to the Queen of Soul . Obama said Holder had led the department with integrity and helped make the US 'free and more just.' He praised Holder as a 'great friend' and a 'great public servant' and brushed away tears at the conclusion of his brief speech. Holder, 64, is staying on the job until the Senate confirms his successor, which is expected soon. The Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday approved Obama's choice of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to succeed Holder. She would be the first black woman to be the nation's top law enforcement officer. In a veiled reference to Rudolph Giuliani's assertion that Obama did not love his country, Holder declared 'those who have loved this nation most have dared greatly and have sought to change the status quo for the better.' Picture perfect: Besides Franklin's performance, the other highlight of the ceremony was the unveiling of Holder's official portrait.

Then he paused and added pointedly, 'Barack Obama.' Holder offered special thanks to Sen. Patrick Leahy, the former Democratic Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. Leahy, of Vermont, defended Holder during Holder's clashes with Republican lawmakers who held him in contempt in the House over a document dispute arising from a gun-trafficking operation known as Fast and Furious. 'In tough times, both professional and personal, this is a man who has been there for me,' Holder said at the top of his remarks.","Obama attended ceremony to unveil Holder's official portrait at the Department of Justice Friday .

"A father has claimed he was threatened with being removed from a bus by the driver because his deaf toddler was being too noisy. Kyle Johnson was travelling back from a paediatric hospital appointment with his son Ethan when the two-year-old got excited and started talking loudly. The driver called the 23-year-old over and said passengers on the Plymouth, Devon, bus had complained. He allegedly told Mr Johnson, a supermarket cleaner, to make his son be quiet or face getting off the vehicle. Kyle Johnson (right) has claimed he was threatened with being removed from a bus in Plymouth, Devon, by the driver because his deaf toddler Ethan (left) was being too noisy . Mr Johnson managed to lull the toddler, who wears two over-the-ear hearing aids, to sleep in his pushchair and stay on the bus - but he has accused the First driver of discrimination. He said: 'I explained to the driver that Ethan was deaf, but his response was ""I really can't do a lot, I've had complaints"". 'It's just discrimination against a disabled child at the end of the day. 'I don't want the driver to be in trouble, but I do want people to have more awareness of deaf children. 'I've had a couple of friends who have deaf children and they've told me it's happened to them numerous times.' Ethan suffers moderate hearing loss in one ear and severe loss in the other, and was travelling home from a development check up at Scott Hospital. Ethan suffers moderate hearing loss in one ear and severe loss in the other, and was travelling back from a development check up at Scott Hospital in Plymouth on a First bus (stock image above) Mr Johnson said the driver called him over a few stops into the short journey back to their house on Wednesday to give them the warning. He said it was the second time he has been threatened by bus drivers over Ethan making too much noise. He said: 'The first time was when Ethan was much younger and didn't have his hearing aids and he was shouting at the top of his voice. 'That was on a longer journey when we were on our way back from Derriford Hospital. 'I know it happens to a lot of parents of deaf children and it's not something they can help.' Ethan's orange hearing aids are clearly visible as he is travelling around. Mr Johnson, a supermarket cleaner, said: 'It's just discrimination against a disabled child at the end of the day' A spokesman for First Bus Group apologised for the 'difficult journey' and said all drivers get customer service and disability awareness training. He said: 'However, as you would expect we cannot anticipate every situation and we don't have a specific instruction for drivers for the set of circumstances as described by Mr Johnson. 'Therefore, in such rare and unpredictable situations, it is left to driver discretion. 'We absolutely recognise how important it is that bus services are accessible for all customers and are currently involved in a number of initiatives to explore specifically how our services can become more accessible for the deaf community.' First Bus Group confirmed it is investigating.","Kyle Johnson, 23, was on a First bus in Plymouth, Devon, with son Ethan .

"A reclusive Missouri man shot dead four relatives and three neighbors in a nighttime rampage after he found his elderly mother dead on her couch, police claim. Joseph Aldridge, 36, allegedly opened fire in four separate locations on Thursday night after his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill, died  at home in Tyrone, Texas County. Nine people are dead in the tiny rural community - including Aldridge, who turned the gun on himself after the shooting spree. The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot. 'She said she seen a man in her dad's bedroom, talking to him in a normal voice. Then she said she heard gunshots and screaming,' an unidentified neighbor said. Scroll down for video . The shooter (pictured in high school) is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48 . Joseph Aldridge, 36, was found dead in his pickup truck in the middle of the highway after shooting seven people dead in rural Missouri. He was described as a recluse by those in town who knew of him . 'She was barefoot, in a nightgown with no sleeves at all and her legs were all scratched up from briars, he told the Springfield News Leader. Armed with a .45-caliber handgun, Aldridge shot two male cousins, their wives, and three neighbors before killing himself in his pickup truck on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, to the east of Texas County, police say. Authorities identified four of the victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold. His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between them 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online. Around town, Aldridge was described as a recluse, and it was unclear what, if anything, he did for a living. Vernetta Lucille Swartz, 76, Joseph Aldridge's aunt, now lives California and said was grief-stricken. 'Two of my nephews and wives were shot, and I guess another nephew was the shooter,' she said. A 15-year-old girl ran to her neighbor's house after hearing her parents shot on a night that would ultimately claim nine lives (pictured) The teenage girl had heard her father talking to a man in a normal voice before screaming and a gunshot made her flee for her life . Police first heard of the incident after the young girl contacted police at around  10:15pm on Thursday evening . Local media identified the other three victims as Darrell Shriver and Shriver's son and daughter-in-law, Carey and Valerie Shriver. Shriver's wife Martha was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. His grandson had hidden in another room and is staying with relatives while his mother is treated. She is expected to survive. 'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' their cousin John W Shriver, 72, said. The elder Shriver discovered the bodies Carey and Valerie after getting a call from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star. The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his relative. He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'. A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville are aware of each other, and that Aldridge 'probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'. John Shriver, 72, is a relative of the Shriver victims, two of whom he found dead on the floor of their bedroom after being called by Martha Shriver, who was wounded but expected . The shootings occurred within three miles of each other near Tyrone, a small town in Texas County, Missouri. Some of the victims were Joseph Aldridge's cousins . Sheriff James Sigman (pictured) identified four victims and a woman who died of natural causes as related to Aldridge, but did not identify three victims, believed to be the Shrivers . He said that there had been an ongoing feud between the suspected shooter's family and some of the victims. Tyrone is estimated to have around 50 residents. All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night. The woman, who Aldridge lived with, died of a heart attack, the Summersville man said. Police discovered her while looking for her son. Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Alice's brother Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between Joseph Aldridge and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online. Joseph Aldridge has a previous criminal history that includes being sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for possessing a handgun while being a marijuana user. He was released in 2010. The shooter later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his GMC pickup, which was in the middle of highway WW early Friday morning. He did not leave a note. Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday. The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects. 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents' the superintendent of nearby Houston's school district said . Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling, according to the Houston Herald. Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation. Children related to victims were not in school on Friday. 'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood. Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.' Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling. Autopsies will be performed over the weekend. Mr Whittaker said that the county averages about one homicide a year, many years having none. Texas County, which has a population of about 25,000, is described as a 'close knit' community.

"The Cleaning Guys have dealt this toxic chemical spills, horrific crime scenes and industrial accidents, but company officials admit none of it had prepared them for their newest job - sanitizing the apartment where U.S. Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan spent three days before being admitted to the hospital. The Dallas-based company has stepped up to clear the soiled bed sheets and clothes that contain Duncan's sweat and other bodily fluids - after his girlfriend revealed they are still in the apartment five days after he was admitted to the hospital and confirmed to have Ebola. 'Obviously, I think anyone involved would be worried -- not necessarily worried, but cautious. We've had a lot of discussions and team meetings about how we're going to attack the situation,' Cleaning Guys vice president Brad Smith told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Big mess: The Cleaning Crew arrived on scene Friday to decontaminate the apartment where Thomas Duncan stayed while infected with Ebola . Suited up: six to eight Cleaning Guys crew members suited up in full hazmat gear to clean the apartment and removed contaminated bedding . 'But we run into hazardous chemicals and things that could hurt us probably more often than most.' Officials hired the Cleaning Guys on Friday after another company backed out of a contract to clean the apartment at The Ivy Apartments in Dallas. The owner of that company had claimed he didn't have the proper permits to transport hazardous materials on state highways. Mr Smith told ABC that Duncan's sheets, blankets and and other belongings in the apartment will be triple-bagged and packed away by the company's crew. They will then be handed over to another company that will incinerate everything. Six to eight cleaners will work in the apartment and anyone who goes in will be suited up in hazmat gear that includes a full face mask, a respirator and a face shield. Ebola has been proven to live in clothing and surfaces for at least six days in ideal conditions. Duncan's girlfriend, Louise Troh, has been quarantined in the apartment she shared with the Ebola patient - along with her 13-year-old son and two nephews. She shockingly revealed to CNN on Thursday that the sheets he sweated in were still on the bed and towels and other clothing with his bodily fluids had not been picked up. Sealed off: Workers used plastic tarps to seal off the apartment where Duncan had been staying . None of the 100 people Duncan had contact with while contagious are showing signs of infection - though about a dozen people are under close observation. The family must be relocated before the cleanup full can begin, a spokesman for the city of Dallas said. He had no information on where the family will go. Visitors from the American Red Cross were seen Thursday bringing food to the apartment door. The North Texas Food Bank said it sent three days of cereal, tuna, produce and other supplies. Outside, the management of the 300-unit complex in northeast Dallas was passing out flyers about Ebola to residents. Private security guards and local sheriff's deputies blocked off the entrance to dozens of reporters. Apartment manager Sally Nuran said employees were power-washing sidewalks and scrubbing common areas, though she believed Duncan had not visited most of the complex in his short time there.","The Dallas-based company specializes in cleaning up hazardous waste, industrial accidents and crime scenes .

"There are worse places to be on a Monday morning. I'm watching grazing deer while dipping a solider into a freshly laid boiled egg.  Soon, I'm going to pull on my wellies have a totter around the vegetable garden and pet some pigs. If it sounds as though I'm living an episode of The Good Life, it's because I am. I'm at The Pig Near Bath, a relatively new hotel in the rolling Mendip Hills in Somerset. The Pig near Bath: Georgian Grade II manor is owned by Robin Hutson (previously of the Hotel du Vin chain) Otherwise known as Hunstrete House, it is one of the latest period properties to come under The Pig namesake, known for freshly picked kitchen garden cooking and a  locally sourced menu. Owner Robin Hutson (previously of the Hotel du Vin chain) bought, renovated and reopened the hotel in March as the third in a litter of four similar venues. Billed as a 'restaurant with rooms' the Pig near Bath's emphasis is on home grown  food . Even if you aren't a foodie you may have heard of it. The hotel made headlines last June when a group of celebrities retired here after Glastonbury. They were a starry lot. Bryan Ferry, Kelis, Daisy Lowe, Alexa Chung, Sadie Frost, Sam Smith and Caroline Flack all made the 30-mile trip from the festival to play croquet, sleep, eat and party some more. But it's not just a rehab for party goers. Billed as a 'restaurant with rooms', the Pig near Bath's emphasis is firmly on food. Local produce: 80 per cent of what is on the menu comes from from within a 25-mile radius . Lounge room: The Georgian Grade II manor house is rustically charming but smart and offbeat . According to Tom Ross, the hotel’s director, 80 per cent of what’s on the plate - if it hasn’t come from less than 25 metres away in the walled garden - is sourced from within a 25-mile radius. ‘The garden is the heartbeat of the hotel,’ he says   showing me around a walled garden with vegetable patches, fruit cages,  greenhouses and nearby poly tunnels. While the concept is not ground-breakingly new or unique, they do it well here. As we walk he picks white strawberries for me to taste (they taste like red ones but less sickly sweet), three varieties of spinach are produced with a magician's flourish and twelve types of chili pointed out. Twelve! We pass bushes of kale the size of a baby elephant, patches of chard, spinach, pickles, beetroot, cucumber plants, cranberries, loganberries and apple trees. The gardeners even cultivated watermelons this summer. Mendip Hills: The surrounding scenery is beautiful and you can go on long walks from the hotel . Hot hot: A greenhouse in the walled garden which grows 12 varieties of blow-your-head-off chili . We pass bushes of kale the size of a baby elephant, patches of chard, spinach, pickles, beetroot and  apples . There are  pigs for petting at the bottom of the garden, and some reared for eating nearby. ‘We don’t name them,’ Tom says rather ominously. He introduces me to chickens (for eggs), quails (likewise) and a sprawling 20 acres of woodland and deer park that surrounds the property for  100  deer. The Georgian Grade II manor house is rustically charming yet smart and offbeat with giant mounted boar’s heads and velvet sofas. Rows of colourful Hunter wellies for guests to use line the front door and log fires permanently rage. Vegetables by the bucket load: The walled garden has fruit cages, greenhouses and nearby poly tunnels too . Rooms start at £139 and rise to £250 a night. There are 29 in all and ours was vast with two large armchairs, a roll top freestanding bath and a four-poster bed. At £199, the cost was stomachable, especially compared with overpriced Bath (where smaller rooms can cost £1,000), and the small things are done well. Interiors have been ‘piggified’ by Robin’s wife Judy, which means an oxymoron of smart shabbiness. Like the food, the decorations are homely and hearty. Our ‘Big Comfy Luxe’ room had framed pressings of ferns, organic Bamford products (also stocked at Liberty) and books on how to make pigeon casserole. Everything revolves around food: The menu  changes daily depending on what's been picked from the garden . Spacious: There are 29 rooms which  start at £139 and rise to £250 a night . For dinner I ate honey roast carrot and beetroot salad, pan fried breast of guinea fowl with  sprouting broccoli and  cabbage. Most of it had been in the ground barely hours earlier. The kitchen is overseen by chef Kamil Oseka and the food that comes out is seriously good and devoid of  pretension. They smoke all their own venison, salt, butter, ham, pancetta and salmon. Downstairs is a library stocked with Penguin Classics, a beautiful bar, billiards room and various spaces for, as they put it, ‘gathering and quaffing’. On the subject, a popular sharpener is the house chili or raspberry infused vodka, which was spot on. For the slovenly, there are two Potting Shed spa rooms.  Tucked at the bottom of the walled garden, they are simple and efficient - if built as a bit of an after thought. The Potting Shed: Rather than a traditional spa the hotel has two modest sheds for treatments . Lying on a heated bed I was rubbed with rosemary oil and kneaded like bread. Surrounded by pots of growing beetroot, scented candles and hanging pitchforks it was not the usual sanitised spa-experience but all the better for it. So what of the future? Tom says there are plans for another Pig hotel possibly in Kent, Sussex or the Cotswolds, but it depends on finding the right property. ‘Hopefully we’ll get some bees for honey soon and I’m set on introducing a pet pig, like a dog, to the house’ That depends on owner Robin Hutson. At the moment Robin presides over three other 'The Pig' hotels; one in The New Forest, another in Southampton and the last little piggy which opened last May, The Pig on the Beach in Dorset. The Pig near Bath is fully booked every weekend from now until June so if you want a go at the trough, you’ll have to try Sunday nights, midweek or a trip for lunch or dinner.","The Pig near Bath is fully booked over weekends for the next five months .

"A 14-year-old Louisiana boy is being hailed as a hero for stopping an out-of-control school bus filled with high school students after a classmate knocked the driver unconscious. The unnamed 15-year-old suspect has been charged with assault for attacking the 26-year-old driver in Baton Rouge Thursday as she was dropping off about a half-dozen students from Christa McAuliffe Superintendent's Academy - an alternative school for teens with disciplinary problems. Police and school officials say the female driver had stopped the bus at around 3pm in the 5100 block of Linden Street to exchange words with the disruptive student. Scroll down for video . Sneak attack: A 26-year-old woman was driving a school bus filled with a half-dozen students from an alternative school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when one of them came up behind her and punched her in the head . Young hero: Tay'veon Slaughter, 14, stepped on the breaks to stop the bus from crashing after the driver was knocked unconscious . According to the driver, when she turned away to face the road, the 15-year-old walked up behind her and punched the woman several times in the head until she passed out. As the 26-year-old victim lost consciousness, her hands and feet slipped from the wheel and the brakes, and the bus started moving again. That is when Tay'veon Slaughter, 14, jumped into action. The quick-thinking eighth-grader slammed his foot on the breaks to stop the bus from crashing and called 911. ‘I knew I had to stop the bus because, you know, she's not responding,’ he told the station WAFB, referring to the driver. ‘The bus was speeding up. So I knew if we get into a wreck, all of us would have been hurt.’ The suspected perpetrator of the attack fled the bus before police responded to the scene. Later that day, the teenager's mother turned him in to police. The 15-year-old was arrested on charges of battery of a bus operator, aggravated obstruction of a roadway and second-degree battery. School officials say the 15-year-old has been suspended pending a disciplinary hearing and could face expulsion. The students about the board were from Christa McAuliffe Center - a school for teens with disciplinary problems . Unaware: When the driver of the bus woke up, she did know she had been attacked and that her face was swollen . The injured driver was taken to a hospital to be treated for her injures. She has since been released to continue her recovery at home. Slaughter said that before the attack on the driver, the 15-year-old was throwing things out the widow and spitting at passing cars. The boy reportedly became upset when the driver asked him to stop and sit down. When the 26-year-old woman regained consciousness, Slaughter said she did not know she had been punched. 'She didn't know that her face was swollen,' the boy recalled to the New Orleans Advocate. Averil Sanders, principal of Christa McAuliffe Superintendent's Academy, said he was proud of Tay’veon for stepping up to the plate in an emergency situation. The humble 14-year-old, however, insisted that he was no hero. 'I had to do what I had to do,' Slaughter said.","Seventh-grader at Christa McAuliffe Center in Louisiana charged with battery for allegedly punching 26-year-old bus driver .

"Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne appeared in a Perth Court on Friday on accusation of gaining passage on a flight under false identification. The self-proclaimed sheik made a brief appearance in Perth Magistrates Court with two of his associates, Mostafa Shiddiquzzaman and Omer Abdirahman Issak, accused using fake identities to board domestic flights. Thorne's bail terms include a personal undertaking, surrendering his passport, not applying for a new passport and staying at least 200m from international departure points. Scroll down for video . Omer Abdirahman Issak (left) and fundamentalist Islamic preacher Junaid Thorne leave court on Friday . The court heard Thorne, 25, had lost his old passport and it had been cancelled by authorities. Shiddiquzzaman and Issak each had their existing bail terms renewed with similar conditions, and were not required to enter pleas. The trio, who had several supporters in the Perth court, are due back in court on April 24, but Thorne and Shiddiquzzaman will not have to appear in person because they are based in NSW. The court appearance follows a raid on Thorne's home in Bass Hill,  south-west of Sydney, in January, where the 25-year-old was subsequently informed of the court notice. The fundamentalist preacher first attracted the attention of authorities when he was deported in 2013 from Saudi Arabia, where he had lived for over a decade, after being detained for protesting his brother's imprisonment on terror-related charges. He has garnered a following on Facebook and Twitter, and is often outspoken on social media, posting online support for the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris and defending slain Melbourne teenage terrorism suspect Numan Haider. Thorne sparked outrage in January when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' and were likely to 'simulate some kind of response' following the terror attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris. Mostafa Shiddiquzzaman (right) and Omer Abdirahman Issak (left) are accused of using false identification . Issak is a known associate of Thorne, and has been released on similar bail conditions . Junaid has garnered a following on Facebook and Twitter, and is often outspoken on social media . His comments came just hours after 12 people were killed in the Paris massacre. Thorne said staff at Charlie Hebdo had 'forbade to learn the lesson' of a firebombing in 2011, which took place a day after a caricature of the Prophet was published. 'Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion,' Thorne tweeted. 'If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise ""freedom of action"".' Since flying from Sydney to Perth this week, the controversial Islamic preacher has tweeted about looking forward to seeing his mother and also detailed in several posts a run-in he had with police at a shopping centre. Authorities are cracking down on Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne after they ordered him to face charges in court following a suspected terror-related raid in Sydney in January . The controversial self-styled sheik was  issued with a notice in January to appear in the Perth court, an AFP spokesperson confirmed . He sparked outrage last week when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' following the terror attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris . Thorne claimed on Thursday night that he was walking with a friend when they were approached by two officers who said hello to him and asked for his friend's name. He said the police kept pressuring his friend until he stepped in and explained that they were 'shopping like normal citizens'. Thorne added that police warned him they would be watching him, despite claims that he had not been acting in a suspicious way. 'We were being polite to the police while they were obviously harassing and trying to provoke us,' he wrote. 'I wonder if we're allowed to shop like normal Australian citizens without being harassed by police who use foul language for no reason?' Thorne said he filmed some of the exchange on his phone but has not released the footage. 'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' Thorne said in January said. Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them (on) certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' The firebrand Perth preacher Thorne (left) has called Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in the past . Over the past 12 months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country. Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them (Islamic State), I would get in trouble,' he said. 'If I was to say that (I) don't support them at all, that would be untrue. 'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.

"When hapless Islamic State militants vowed to take over Rome and 'throw homosexuals off the leaning tower of pizza', Italians responded with a flood of mocking responses. Now, Twitter users have jokingly suggested other culinary hotspots for militants to visit with the hashtag #jihadifoodtour. If they're planning a visit to the UK, jihadi tourists can take in the 'London Pie', 'Sconehenge', 'Big Ben and Jerrys' and the 'Angel Cake of the North'. Scroll down for video . Jihadi joke: A popular new hashtag on Twitter suggests other food-based places for jihadis to visit . Sconehenge! Amy on Twitter suggested jihadis visit the prehistoric monument in Wiltshire . The trend was started on tonight's episode of The Last Leg on Channel 4, presented by comedian Adam Hills . A tweet from the programme' account referred to a blunder by an ISIS supporter who threatened to invade Italy's 'leaning tower of PIZZA' Other must-visit foodie destinations suggested include the 'Trifle Tower', 'The Great Wall of Quinoa' and the 'Sydney Okra House'. The trend was started on tonight's episode of The Last Leg on Channel 4, where comedians Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker look at the week's events. After introducing the trend, Hills kicked things off with 'Empire Steak Building' and Widdicombe responded with 'Battenburg Gate'. The programme's account on Twitter wrote: 'This week's poll! What other food-based monuments should Jihadi march on? #jihadifoodtour'.

The announcement came days after masked jihadists revealed their intention to conquer the city in a video that showed the mass beheading of 21 Christians in Libya. But rather than spark widespread panic, the threats triggered a flood of mocking responses - with dozens taking to social media to make fun of the jihadists and their takeover plans.

"'Still in charge': Documents declassified for a terror trial seem to show Osama bin Laden was a key Al-Qaeda decision-maker - even in hiding . Osama bin Laden was in still in charge of al-Qaeda and making crucial decisions for the terror network right up until the US assassinated him, according to court documents. Bin Laden, who was killed by a Navy SEALs raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, was being asked to approve operational decisions until his death, files taken from his compound say. The revelations came when the files were made public as part of a terror trial in Brooklyn, New York, where Abid Naseer, 28, is accused of plotting to launch an attack on the New York subway system. Included among the pages of documents, acquired and published by the New York Post, is an exchange in which an al-Qaeda commander asks permission to relocate a terrorist cell to Iran. Bin Laden's correspondent wrote: 'Sheikh Yunis is ready to move and travel. The destination, in principle, is Iran, and he has with him six to eight brothers that he chose. 'I told him we are waiting for final complete confirmation from you to move, and agree on this destination. 'His plan is: stay around three months in Iran to train the brothers there then start moving them and distributing them in the world for their missions and specialties. He explained those to you in his report and plan.' The Post said that the purpose of the Iranian move was to plan terror attacks on Europe. Different documents also ask for advice on how best to wage their 'jihad war' against the Pakistani government. Scroll down to read the documents . Back-seat commander: Bin Laden, pictured above in his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan, was asked whether a bloodthirsty terror cell was allowed to relocate to Iran . Raid: The papers addressed to bin Laden were recovered by U.S. authorities from the compound . Elsewhere in the cache of documents, an Al-Qaeda advisor details how the terror group had warned authorities in the country to stop opposing their actions - or face the prospect of attacks in major cities. In the letters, bin Laden is also given disturbing updates on terrorist movements around the world - including in Britain, Germany, Turkey and Denmark. On trial: The documents were declassified in the hope of locking up Naseer Abid . The declassified papers were presented at the trial for Naseer, who is accused of plotting to attack a shopping mall in Manchester, England in 2009, as well as scheming to bomb the New York subway. He never faced charges in the UK and the evidence against him has only emerged six years after his arrest. Naseer is alleged to have been at the helm of a British Al-Qaeda terror cell that was part of a broader conspiracy 'to repeat the devastation of 9/11'. Prosecutors called it one of the most serious terror plots since the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, it is alleged. Naseer, a former student in the UK studying English and computer science, denies the charges. He is being tried in the United States because of the alleged subway plot.

"Bill Cosby's lawyers asked a federal judge Friday to toss out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women accusing the beleaguered comedian of decades-old sexual offenses. The accusers, all of whom have stepped forward in recent years, say Cosby's representatives publicly branded them as liars while trying to defend his innocence. But Cosby's lawyers say the actor was merely acting in self-defense as his character was under attack. Scroll down for video . Fighting back: Bill Cosby's lawyers have asked a federal judge to throw out a defamation lawsuit filed by three women accusing the comedian of decades-old sexual offenses . 'The law does not require that one stand idly by while he is publicly attacked,' the lawyers argue in their 38-page filing. 'Instead the law entitles an individual who is accused of serious wrongdoing to rebut the allegations without facing defamation claims.' Joseph Cammarata, a lawyer for the three accusers, said his clients disagree with that position. 'We believe that the law provides that when you make a public statement about an individual, it must be truthful,' he said. 'We look forward to an opportunity to have the truth tried by a jury who can ultimately determine which of the parties was being truthful.' Cosby's legal team say their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct. The former star of the groundbreaking sitcom The Cosby Show hasn't been charged with any crime. More than a dozen women have stepped forward in recent years to level various assault accusations. Tamara Green, a 56-year-old California lawyer, says Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her Los Angeles-area apartment in the early 1970s. Therese Serignese says Cosby drugged and raped her in a dressing room after a show in Las Vegas around 1976. And Linda Traitz alleges he tried to drug her and then groped her on a Southern California beach in about 1970. Speaking out: Tamara Green, a California lawyer, filed the defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby in December 2014 claiming that he and his attorneys said she had lied about a sexual assault from 40 years ago . Accuser: Green, pictured here in her youth, claimed that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in her Los Angeles-area apartment in the early 1970s . Green was joined in the lawsuit by Linda Traitz (left), who alleged that Cosby tried to drug her and then sexually groped her in 1970, and nurse Therese Serignese (right), 57, who said the comic raped her in 1976 when she was 19 years old . Cosby's lawyers say his representatives were responding to the accusations in strongly-worded rebukes. One November 2014 statement references Traitz's 'extensive' criminal record, which includes larceny, fraud and drug possession charges. 'As the old saying goes, ""consider the source,""' wrote Cosby attorney Martin Singer, who also attached copies of Traitz's Florida criminal and prison records with the statement. Another November 2014 statement cited by Cosby's accusers offers 'general comments' on the allegations and does not specifically name any of the accusers, his lawyers say. 'The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity,' Singer wrote at the time. 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' The three women seek an unspecified amount of money for compensatory and punitive damages. Many of the accusations against him exceed the statute of limitations for criminal prosecution. But the scandal has taken its toll on the 77-year-old actor and comedian as he has sought to revive his career with a national stand-up comedy tour. Cosby has canceled or postponed more than a dozen performances as more accusers have come forward, and women's groups have protested or threatened to rally at many of his public appearances. Lawyers for the three accusers have until March 20 to file a reply to Cosby's motion to dismiss the suit. Green originally filed the defamation lawsuit in December 2014 and Serignese and Traitz joined later. The suit is filed in US District Court in Springfield, in western Massachusetts. Cosby has a home nearby in Shelburne Falls.","Lawyer Tamara Green sued Cosby in December after claiming that he drugged and assaulted her in the 1970s .

"A man who was driving around in the middle of the night to clear his head  has found the $250,000 NASCAR race car that was stolen from a hotel parking lot. Philip Whitmer, 30, from Monroe, Georgia, was driving along around 2.30am Saturday morning in Atlanta suburb Loganville when he saw driver Travis Kvapil's bright orange Team XTREME car. The self-employed NASCAR fan had heard about the Friday morning theft outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia, but was 'shocked' when he stumbled upon the now-famous racer while thinking about his 'rocky' relationship. 'I said there's no way it's that car. I didn't believe it,' he told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . The North Carolina-based racing team posted this picture of their car with the caption 'lost and found section of the road' Philip Whitmer, 30, of Monroe, Georgia, found Travis Kvapil's NASCAR vehicle when he was driving around at 2.30am to clear his head about relationship issues . NASCAR fan Mr Whitmer posted this picture of the found car on his Facebook page, where his friends could not believe what he had found . Mr Whitmer saw the car on a dirt road and posted a picture of it on Facebook for his incredulous friends. He had driven past the  road previously in the night around 1am and decided not to go down it. 'It's a very remote road so it's got to be somebody from around here who knows this area to stumble across that road,' he said. The front of the car near the air dam was damaged, and the car was parked next to a small wooden ramp, presumably used to remove it from the trailer it was stolen in. Inside of the car appeared fine, according Mr Whitmer. There is a neighborhood abut 200 yards from where the vehicle was parked, but no suspicious activity was reported in that area prior to Mr Whitmer's call, a spokesman for the Gwennitt County Police told Daily Mail Online. Mr Kvapil was supposed to drive the Chevrolet race car on Sunday but had to drop out of the Atlanta Sprint Cup Series event after missing a mandatory inspection. Mr Whitmer  was dismissed from the scene by police while they contacted the small-budget Team XTREME, who arrived at the site around 4:30am. Team Xtreme owner John Cohen and his colleagues came and picked up the vehicle around 4.30am Saturday morning after being contacted by police in Gwennitt County . The team posted a picture of owner John Cohen standing next to the vehicle, saying that they are 'so happy to have ""old faithful"" back'. Mr Whitmer has not yet met the NASCAR team, though police said they would relay his information to the owners. Car and team are heading back to their base in Mooresville, North Carolina, according to NBC. The No. 44 car inside its trailer was hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow when it was stolen 35 miles from where it was found. Surveillance photo shows the truck and trailer being driven out of the parking lot by an unidentified man around 5:30am, just 15 minutes before the team was scheduled to leave for the Atlanta Motor Speedway. A crewman had been outside smoking a cigarette just a few minutes before the theft of the trailer, which had no markings saying that it had a valuable NASCAR vehicle inside. In addition to the race car, the trailer also contained a spare engine valued at $100,000 and racing equipment valued at $17,500, according to a police report. Team Xtreme Racing owner John Cohen estimated the total value to be somewhere between $350,000 and $400,000. The car was inside a trailer hitched to a black 2004 Ford pickup truck (pictured) parked outside the team's hotel in Morrow, Georgia. The team's owner estimated it was carrying almost $400,000 worth of equipment . Mr Kvapil (pictured outside the Atlanta Motor Speedway on Friday) was supposed to drive the $250,000 Chevrolet race car for the small-budget Team XTREME but had to back out from the race . NASCAR fans and drivers offered rewards for finding the vehicle on Friday, including pit pass tickets to races and a lifetime of free food from Golden Corral offered by driver Michael Waltrip. Mr Whitmer said he had been contacted on social media by many NASCAR fans and drivers, and that there wasn't anything he'd particularly like but 'it might be nice to have a nice little payday'. When asked about possibly getting an endless amount of free buffets, he said, 'That'd be fine with me.' Team Xtreme is taking the car back to their North Carolina base and plans to race at next weekend's event in Las Vegas after being unable to compete in Atlanta. Mr Kvapil tweeted about the theft on Friday, asking his followers to 'let me know' if they saw his car around. He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap''. The driver had doubted that the thieves would be able to make any money off of the car. 'There's really no use for it out in the general public. I don't really know what you can do with it.' 'I hope they realize that and will leave it somewhere where police can find it.' Kvapil tweeted about the theft, asking his followers to 'let me know' if they saw his car around. He also wrote: 'I bet when whoever has it, opens the trailer and is going to be like 'oh snap' Team Xtreme (pictured at Daytona International Speedway on February 20) will take his recovered car to the Sprint Cup Series event in Las Vegas next week . Mr Kvapil said he was crushed that he now wouldn't have the opportunity to race in what would have been his first track appearance of 2015, calling it a 'big setback'. 'You can handle maybe getting a flat tire, or getting caught up in a wreck, or a blown engine, something that actually happens on the race track,' he said. 'Or you don't qualify, because you don't have enough speed. But to not even get a chance ... that's pretty disheartening.' The theft hit the small Team Xtreme Racing even harder, especially after they had wrecked a car in a Daytona 500 qualifying race just last week. Not only did the team have to work overtime to get a new car prepared for this weekend's race, the stolen car was Mr Cohen's favorite. 'I just feel bad for my guys, they were really proud of this car,' he told ESPN. 'I called that car Old Faithful, because you could run that car anywhere and it would do good.' Mr Kvapil said he was crushed that he now wouldn't have the opportunity to race in what would have been his first appearance of 2015, calling it a 'big setback'","The $250,000 Chevrolet race car was stolen in trailer hitched to a  truck .

"Cardinal George Pell - who was hand-picked by Pope Francis to examine the Vatican's finances - has been accused of spending half a million euros (AU$740,000) of church money on lavish personal expenditures including business class flights, a personal assistant and luxury furniture for his Rome apartment. The allegations against the Victorian-born cardinal and former Archbishop of Sydney were leaked to Italian magazine L'Espresso, published on Friday.

But the recent allegations say he purchased a flurry of extravagant items, such as $3600 on religious robes and $6650 on kitchen sink fittings. The magazine also claimed the former archbishop of Sydney spent more than $5100 a month to rent an office and apartment, the latter of which he allegedly fitted with $87,000 in furniture. He flew on a string of business class flights and pays $21,600-a-month to an Australian assistant, it is alleged.

The leaks are suspected to be the work of those inside the church who are unhappy with Cardinal Pell's increasing influence. Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi condemned the leaks as illegal, asserting they were 'unworthy and petty.' 'Passing confidential documents to the press for polemical ends or to foster conflict are not new, but is always to be strongly condemned, and is illegal,' he said.

"A snake charmer from Malaysia kissed the same species of venomous snake that killed his father with one deadly bite for upcoming TV series ‘World’s Most Talented’. Amjad Khan from Taiping City is known throughout Malaysia as ‘The Snake Prince’ because of his ability to charm snakes with a hypnotic technique and the fact that he has been kissing them since he was one years old. Coming face to face with a king cobra – the world’s largest venomous snake – the 27-year-old daredevil performs the same stunt attempted by his father when he was bitten during a show in Kuala Lumpur. Amjad comes face to face with the same species of snake that killed his father with a single deadly bite . Known by many as ‘The Snake King’, Amjad’s father Ali Khan Samsudin, who was featured in the Guinness Book of Records and was reportedly bitten 99 times in his life, was unable to receive treatment for his injury and died two days later. A fourth generation snake charmer, Amjad is filmed lifting the cobra from its box and placing it casually on the ground before him. Sitting down opposite it, the snake immediately lunges for him but he skilfully moves himself from harm’s way and begins the hypnotic process of calming it. As Amjad sits opposite the snake it lunges at him before he begins to charm it with some hand movements . Pointing his finger at the snake before placing it inside its mouth, Amjad brings his hand away and edges himself closer to the cobra. The snake retaliates by sticking its tongue out as if anticipating an attack and Amjad leans in to give it a kiss. Speaking to presenter Laura Jackson before the accomplishment Amjad tells her that he is only 10% scared of the king cobra because of what happened to his dad. Amjad is a fourth generation snake charmer and son of 'The Snake King', former Guinness World Record holder Ali Khan Samsudin . ‘He was bitten by the King Cobra, and the doctors said we couldn’t do anything. I feel like something is missing,’ he said. Watching the stunt live, Laura calls the achievement insane. She said: ‘I’m not going to sleep tonight, that was a whole new level of danger. I was terrified watching – I couldn’t believe it.’ ‘World’s Most Talented’ is a global tournament contested by representatives from two different countries who will go head to head each week. The world’s largest venomous snake, the king cobra is skillfully charm before Amjad moves in to kiss it . Amjad, who competes against an Italian, will have his performance judged by 100 international vloggers . The performances will be judged by an international jury of 100 vloggers, and contestants will compete to see their country named the world’s most talented. Amjad will feature in the third episode of the Watch series, and will be up against tough competition in the form of an Italian riding a road bike on a handrail over the edge of a cliff. The first episode of the series will air on Watch on Tuesday, March 31 at 9pm.","Amjad Khan from Taiping City is known in Malaysia as ‘The Snake Prince’

"Soldiers from Chad armed with rocket propelled grenades, armoured vehicles and assault rifles have crossed into neighbouring Nigeria to battle the growing menace of Boko Haram. Photos taken from the country's east show the heavily armed Chadian soldiers standing before destroyed vehicles and mangled corpses of the Islamist militants. But in a brutal reprisal, Boko Haram fighters have raided more than a dozen villages near the border with Cameroon, where scores of militants shot and hacked residents to death. A Chadian soldier rides atop a pickup truck next to a bag of rocket propelled grenades . A convoy of trucks belonging to the Chad army travel through the town of Gambaru, Nigeria . Chadian soldiers, armed to the teeth with guns and explosives, stop to rest during their offensive against Boko Haram . Hundreds of residents fled across the border into Cameroon, prompting Chad - part of a regional coalition against the Islamists - to respond by bombarding rebel positions. 'They targeted  mainly Shuwa tribesmen, who are from the same ethnic group as a large number of the Chadian troops,' said Adum Walfannea, himself a Shuwa Arab, from Anguduram village. Kurso Khala, who fled one of the worst-affected villages, Mudu, said the militants besieged a local market and blocked all but one entrance. 'They would ask if a person is Kanuri or Shuwa before asking him to go,' said Khala by telephone from Fotokol, across the border from the Nigerian town of Gamboru in the far north of Cameroon. 'Once a person was identified as Shuwa‎ he would be shot in the back as soon as he stepped out of the market entrance to leave.' Walfannea and Imar Koshnana, from Musiye village, both said the death toll from the attacks could be high but there was no official confirmation of numbers.

Pictured is a belt of charms carried by a Chadian soldier during battle against the militants . A soldier fixes his headscarf while riding atop a Chadian army pickup truck currently deployed in north east Nigeria . News of the raids comes as Nigeria's military trumpets its success in recapturing several towns from Boko Haram and after President Goodluck Jonathan said the 'tide had turned' against the militants. Details were slow to emerge because the insurgents have destroyed telecom masts since the insurgency began in 2009. The attacks follow the Chadian ground and aerial offensive against Boko Haram enclaves  that began on February 17 after troops seized the strategic town of Dikwa. Residents said Boko Haram suffered heavy casualties in the Chadian attacks, which were near the group's Sambisa Forest stronghold, where they have long had camps. One resident from the herding village of Gonori near Gamboru, Umar Sanda, said troops fought back after Boko Haram stole more than 400 cattle and killed four residents in a pre-dawn raid on Tuesday. 'For more than two hours we kept hearing sounds of gunfire and explosions,' he added. 'The Chadian troops killed scores of the Boko Haram gunmen and recovered our cattle.'

Meanwhile, Nigeria's army chief said that residents displaced from Baga town in the country's northeast should be able to return to vote in March elections after the military reclaimed the town. Lieutenant General Kenneth Minima spoke to journalists Wednesday in Maiduguri after he said he visited the town on Lake Chad in northeastern Nigeria, near the borders of Chad, Niger and Cameroon. Minima said that Nigeria's army would take back more towns from the Islamic extremists. 'From today it is never again for insurgents to take hold of any of our territory. I told them that today it is going to be victory all the way because the war is almost ended. From here we move to retake Gwoza, Marte and Madagali,' he said. He said he was confident that it was 'achievable to end the Boko Haram activities very soon,' and that residents who have been displaced should be able to return to their homes for March 28 presidential elections. A Chadian soldier peers into a burnt out armoured vehicle that once belonged to Boko Haram . A man suspected of being a member of Boko Haram sits captive with his hands tied before Chadian soldiers . Boko Haram, which denounces democracy as a corrupt Western concept, has warned it will disrupt the elections with attacks. Neighboring countries increasingly have been drawn into Nigeria's 5-year Islamic uprising, which has killed thousands and driven 1.6 million people from their homes, including across borders into Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Boko Haram has been recruiting fighters in all three countries. Cameroon officials said that its prisons, especially at its border with Nigeria, are overcrowded with suspected Boko Haram members. Maroua Central Prison registrar Ngeh Emmanuel said that 30,000 people have been detained in 25 prisons in Cameroon since May 2014, up from 22,000 detained before that. More soldiers are needed to stop inmates from endless attempts to break out of jail, he said. A Chad army vehicle passes through Nigeria before launching an offensive against Boko Haram .

"Google has done a U-turn on its plans to crack down on pornography, after bloggers complained that they need to publish explicit photographs in order to ‘express their identities’. Earlier this week the web search giant told people who publish explicit videos and images on its Blogger platform that it would hide their posts from public view if they didn’t clean up their act. It gave them a month to delete any offensive posts, or face having their accounts made ‘private’ so that they could only be viewed through the author’s own account. Google had previously announced changes to its Blogger platform banning graphic images from public view . The move was widely welcomed by campaigners who fear that pornography is too easily accessible on the internet, including by children. However, the American company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers. Many of the people who post explicit material said they needed to express themselves, and complained that Google would be erasing collections of explicit material that they had built up over the course of ten years. Google responded that it would revert to its previous policy, which allows bloggers to publish offensive sexual images and videos as long as they are placed behind a page warning viewers that it is adult content. But the American company rowed back on its promise just three days later following a backlash from bloggers . ‘We’ve had a ton of feedback, in particular about the introduction of a retroactive change (some people have had accounts for 10+ years), but also about the negative impact on individuals who post sexually explicit content to express their identities,’ the company said. ‘So rather than implement this change, we’ve decided to step up enforcement around our existing policy prohibiting commercial porn.’ The web search giant will only ban content that is illegal, or has been published without the consent of the people it features. It had never threatened to ban nude photographs that offered ‘substantial public benefit’ on artistic, educational or scientific grounds. The company’s Blogger platform does not account for every blog on the internet. However, it includes accounts ending in ‘blogspot.com’, a free service with millions of users.","Google had planned to hide pornographic material from public searches .

"Former welterweight boxing champion Oscar Diaz has died at the age of 32 - seven years after his  career came to a brutal end when he suffered a debilitating brain injury during a televised fight. Diaz, then 25, was rushed to hospital after collapsing before the 11th round of a USBA welterweight championship match against Delvin Rodriguez, which was nationally broadcast on ESPN-2 in 2008.

"Illinois Congressman Aaron Schock has reportedly repaid the US Government $40,000 from his personal checking account for redecoration to his congressional office in the style of the TV show Downton Abbey. Schock, 33, paid $35,000 earlier this month to the owner of the Illinois decorating firm Euro Trash, and $5,000 more on Thursday, according to financial records reviewed by the Associated Press. His official House expense account had previously paid the group for its services. Illinois Rep. Aaron Schock has reimbursed the U.S. Government for $40,000 worth of renovations he made to his congressional office . Photos taken in January of Schock's new office in the Rayburn Office Building, which was designed to resemble the dining room of the PBS show Downton Abbey . Schock, a rising star in the Republican Party, has been under scrutiny for using taxpayer money to pay for the redecorating, as well as using his official and campaign funds for flights on donor-owned planes and concert tickets. The Washington Post was first to describe the office decorations in early February. A watchdog group has since requested a House ethics review of the congressman's spending. Schock's office said Friday his payments made good on an earlier promise to personally shoulder the costs of the office renovation. Schock wrote two checks - for $25,000 on February 4 and $10,000 on February 6 - to Tracy 'Annie' Brahler, owner of Euro Trash. He wrote a third check for $5,000 on Thursday. 'Congressman Schock has fulfilled his commitment to pay for all the renovation costs,' his office said Friday in a prepared statement. It said that while congressional office costs are usually paid from office expense accounts, 'the congressman believed it appropriate to pay these costs himself.' Over the last month, he has paid for his decor with three checks to Tracy 'Annie' Brahler, owner of Euro Trash: one check on February 4 for $25,000, one on February 6 for $10,000 and one on Thursday for $5,000 . Schock is in his fourth term representing the Peoria and Springfield areas. This week, Schock brought on board a team of campaign finance lawyers and public relations experts to address the controversy about his expenses. His financial charges - including the use of his donors' private aircraft and concert tickets - were detailed by the AP and other news organizations since news of the decoration work became public. An AP review this week identified at least a dozen flights worth more than $40,000 on contributors' planes since mid-2011, tracking Schock's reliance on the aircraft partly through the congressman's pictures uploaded to his Instagram account. The AP extracted hidden location data associated with each image; it then correlated it with flight records showing airport stopovers and expenses later billed for air travel against Schock's office and campaign records. Lawmakers can use office funds for private flights as long as payments cover their share of the costs. Schock's financial charges have been made public after organizations questioned what his expenses were going toward. He has spent thousands on concerts and car mileage reimbursements . When Schock's office originally made headlines, the congressman wouldn't reveal if the inspiration for the room was the hit TV show Downton Abbey (pictured above) But most of the flights Schock covered with office funds occurred before the House changed its rules in January 2013. Those earlier rules prohibited lawmakers from using those accounts to pay for flights on private aircraft, allowing payments only for federally licensed charter and commercial flights. Schock previously told the AP he travels frequently throughout his Peoria-area district 'to stay connected with my constituents,' and that he takes compliance with congressional funding rules seriously. Schock also spent thousands more on tickets for concerts, car mileage reimbursements - among the highest in Congress - and took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry concert last June. His office is still reviewing those transportation and entertainment charges. The Post first reported that Brahler donated her services as she decorated Schock's Washington office with red carpet and red walls accented with antique-looking frames and sconces reminiscent of 'Downton Abbey.' The popular PBS show depicts the lives of aristocratic families and their servants in 1920s England. Brahler refunded to the U.S. government $35,000 paid to her from Schock's congressional office expense account, records show, within days of the Post's report. A liberal-leaning group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, had requested an investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an outside panel that reviews ethics complaints against House members.","Illinois Representative Aaron Schock paid $35,000 earlier this month and $5,000 on Thursday to Illinois decorating firm Euro Trash .

"Energy and Climate Change committee chairman Tim Yeo accused comparison sites of 'behaving more like backstreet market traders' Rip-off price comparison websites are under pressure to compensate customers who lost out because they were kept in the dark about cheap energy deals. MPs on the Energy and Climate Change committee have accused industry giants of acting like back street market traders to boost their profits at the expense of families struggling to pay for heat and light. The companies in the firing line are uSwitch, MoneySupermarket, ComparetheMarket, Confused.com and Go Compare, which spend millions on TV ads presenting themselves as the consumer champions. MPs said the firms set up their websites in such a way that people shopping around for cheaper gas and electricity were directed towards suppliers that pay them millions in commission. Customers searching for better tariffs were presented with a drop-down menu of energy firms that pay commission, rather than a list of all the deals available, including cheaper options from small suppliers. The net result was that the firms collected a payment of £50-£70 for each dual fuel switch, while consumers may have ended up paying hundreds of pounds more than they needed to. In a report published today, the committee said the firms should pay compensation to all the customers who missed out on the cheapest energy deal as a result of the suspect tactics. The Conservative chairman of the committee, Tim Yeo MP, said: ‘Consumers trust price comparison services to help them switch to the best energy deals available on the market. 'But some energy price comparison sites have been behaving more like backstreet market traders than the trustworthy consumer champions they make themselves out to be in adverts on TV. ‘Some comparison sites have used misleading language to dupe consumers into opting for default options that only display commission earning deals. An advertisement for MoneySupermarket. The site defended themselves by saying they operate according to the standards of an industry code approved by Ofgem . 'And others have previously gone so far as to conceal deals that do not earn them commission behind multiple drop-down web options.’ He added: ‘As an immediate and essential first step towards rebuilding confidence, the companies should compensate any consumers who have been encouraged to switch to tariffs that may not have been the cheapest or most appropriate for their needs.’ However, the Committee has no power to force the firms to pay compensation beyond the pressure to ‘name and shame’. MPs are concerned that consumers are kept in the dark about the commission payments and believe there is a good case for making website disclose the amount when a customer decides to switch. Mr Yeo said: ‘We have no objection to commission being paid by suppliers to price comparison websites as long as the arrangements are clearly disclosed.’ The committee is also calling on the industry regulator Ofgem to set up a new licensing regime for price comparison websites to replace existing voluntary codes in order to ensure they give customers a fair deal. The chairman said: ‘The current hands-off approach is clearly not working and the lack of contrition from some companies even when faced with proof that they misled customers has convinced us that some form of licensing of energy price comparison sites may be needed. ‘If the Government wants more people to switch energy supplier then it has to ensure that energy price comparison services are transparent and trusted. ‘We recognise that the criticisms contained in this report do not apply across all price comparison websites. 'We hope that the debate sparked by this report on how price comparison websites operate will provide all sites – both good and bad – with an opportunity to take stock of their operations and strive for greater transparency.’ Comparethemarket hit back at the MPs, accusing them of being sensationalist. MPs said the firms set up their websites in such a way that people shopping around for cheaper gas and electricity were directed towards suppliers that pay them millions in commission . A spokesman said: ‘We have never misled customers and are very disappointed by the sensationalist approach of making broad brush accusations against the whole industry. ‘Within the report, the Committee does concede that their criticisms do not pertain to all price comparison websites. 'We have always maintained we are totally transparent and only make money when people save money.’ uSwitch said it has paid compensation in the ‘rare’ cases where customers may have been misled. Chief executive, Steve Weller, said: ‘Price comparison websites have a vital role to play in making the energy market work for consumers. 'Our simple, free to use service saved consumers £112 million on their energy bills last year. ‘Customers have the clear choice to compare plans on our website across the whole energy market. 'In line with our complaints process, we have made payments to customers in the very rare occasions where we have fallen short of our strict procedures over the phone.’ Gocompare.com said: ‘We constantly review our website to identify any changes needed, and have already made improvements to our energy comparison service which we believe will encourage people to make an active decision regarding their energy tariffs.’ MoneySupermarket and Confused.com both said they operate according to the standards of an industry code approved by Ofgem.","Energy and Climate Change committee slam industry giants in report .

"Nick Clegg's 'swivel eyed' obsession with Europe could prevent a second coalition deal with the Conservatives, senior Lib Dems warn . Nick Clegg's 'swivel-eyed' obsession with Europe could prevent a second coalition deal with the Conservatives, senior Liberal Democrats have warned. The Deputy Prime Minister has publicly said he will consider a deal with whoever emerges on top if the May election results in another hung parliament. But his friends say that in private he has all but ruled out agreeing to a referendum – raising doubts about the viability of a deal with the Conservatives, and potentially forcing the party into a deal with Labour. The extraordinary description of Mr Clegg as 'swivel-eyed' underlines the frustration of some senior Lib Dems that Mr Clegg may put his passion for the EU ahead of the interests of the party and country. One Lib Dem minister said Mr Clegg's obsession was on a par with that of Tory Eurosceptics, who have pushed the Prime Minister to agree to a referendum. The minister said there was 'no way' Mr Clegg would sign up to the Tory plans, which David Cameron has made a deal-breaker in any coalition talks. 'This is pretty much a red line for Nick,' the source said. 'There is no way he will sign up to plans that will allow the Tories to set the terms of a renegotiation, carry out that renegotiation and then hold a referendum on that basis which could see Britain leave the EU. 'Europe is part of his reason for being in politics – it's his lifeblood. In his own way he's as swivel-eyed about Europe as [Tory Eurosceptic] Peter Bone – it's just that his eyes swivel in the opposite direction.' An ally of Mr Cameron once famously described Eurosceptic Tory activists as 'swivel-eyed loons'. The Prime Minister and his Lib Dem deputy attempted to put on a show of unity yesterday with a rare joint press conference to announce a devolution package for Wales. But behind the scenes, the two men are said to be further apart than ever, particularly over Europe. Many senior Lib Dems believe the party could extract a high price during coalition talks with the Conservatives in return for backing an in-out referendum on Europe. Mr Clegg served his political apprenticeship in Brussels, working as an aide to former European Commissioner Leon Brittan before becoming an MEP in his own right. Friends say he was enraged by Mr Cameron's 2011 decision to veto an EU treaty without consulting him, and no longer trusts the Prime Minister on European issues. For the past two years, Mr Clegg has vetoed attempts by the Conservatives to legislate for a referendum. Mr Cameron – driven by Tory fear of Ukip – has vowed to hold an in/out referendum by the end of 2017 if he wins power in May. The Prime Minister and Nick Clegg attempted to put on a show of unity yesterday with a rare joint press conference to announce a devolution package for Wales . Speaking to party activists last year he appeared to make it a 'red line' for coalition talks, saying: 'I would not be prime minister of a government unless we could carry out our pledge of an in-out referendum.' One Tory MP said: 'Cameron wouldn't last five minutes if he tried to drop the referendum. He knows that, and we know that. It is not going to happen.' Meanwhile, Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Tim Farron said yesterday that the Lib Dems would have to try to cut a deal with Labour if it ends up as the largest party – even if the Tories get more votes. He told the New Statesman magazine: 'Let's say the Tories get more votes and Labour wins more seats, which is quite possible, we may think that morally we should put the Tories in but... we won't have a choice.'","Senior Liberal Democrats have warned of leader's obsession with Europe .

"Republican leader John Boehner could see a coup attempt to unseat him as House Speaker as early as this coming week - after hardline conservatives derailed his  bill to keep the Department of Homeland Security funded. Conservatives within his own party could try to remove the Ohio representative as Speaker of the House as soon as next week, according to his close allies. The threats to challenge Boehner's leadership come as hardline conservative Republicans voted against his bill to keep DHS funded for three weeks, . Scroll down for video . Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner could lose his position atop the lower chamber of Congress in the fight for a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security . Right-wing lawmakers had inserted amendments to block President Obama's executive order immigration reforms in previous bills, which they refused to vote for when the measures were taken out. A bill submitted by Boehner Friday for three weeks of funding failed to pass 203-224, with 52 Republicans voting against it. An emergency one-week bill to fund the agency passed 357-60 Friday night, though fifty-five Republicans voted against it as well. President Obama signed the deal to fund the agency responsible for fighting terrorism for another week ten minutes before its money would have run out at midnight. Allies of the speaker say that if he calls for a vote on a bill without the conservative immigration amendments, he may face a vote challenging his role as the party's leader in the House. Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate, told CNN he had heard that conservatives were using the fight over funding to make a play for removing Boehner. Twenty-five Republican legislators voted against the Cincinnati native during a vote for speaker at the beginning of this year. It was the largest attempt by a party to unseat its incumbent speaker since the Civil War, according to the Washington Post. An attempt to unseat him would most likely not succeed, but could embarrass the 13-term congressman. Twenty-five House Republicans voted against John Boehner as speaker during a January vote (pictured), the largest vote by a party to unseat its incumbent speaker since the Civil War . President Obama signed the deal to fund the agency responsible for fighting terrorism for another week ten minutes before its money would have run out at midnight. Fifty-five Republicans voted against it when it passed 357-60 Friday night. The Senate voted through a 'clean' DHS funding bill last week. A funding bill from last year gave the rest of the government through the fiscal year that ends in September, but funded Homeland Security through Friday to create a showdown over immigration. Potential new Republican speakers include Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan and House Majority Kevin McCarthy of California, but both are loyal to Boehner. The speaker told reporters Thursday that his job was not on the line in the current conflict. 'He is the speaker of the United States House until he’s not,' Ohio Republican Rep. Frank Lucas, who supports Boehner, told POLITICO. The speaker led House Republicans to their largest majority since the 1940s in the fall elections and his party currently control 245 seats in the chamber.

"He visited supermarkets but did so with an AK47 casually slung over his shoulder and he was pictured celebrating his wedding but his bride had travelled to Syria to find a herself a holy warrior. Ibrahim al-Mazwagi was one of a group of Londoners - now thought to include Jihadi John - among the first to travel to Syria to fight in about 2012. It's believed Jihadi John - this week unmasked as Brit Mohammed Emwazi - was one of more than 700 fighters in the Katiba al-Muhajireen (The Migrants Brigade) who arrived in the Middle East three years ago. Pictures of members of the brigade have flooded social media in recent years and a video of al-Mazwagi, who is the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, lifted the lid on life as a terrorist - from shopping for cereal to target practice. Scroll down for video .

Unmasked: Mohammed Emwazi from London was this week revealed as the man behind the 'Jihadi John' mask . A source who claimed to have met Emwazi in Syria told Channel 4 News that he was a member of one of the earliest groups from London who travelled to fight for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. Shiraz Maher, of the King's College London's radicalisation centre, said he was investigating whether Emwazi was among the group, which also includes Mohammad el-Araj and Choukri Ellekhlifi, both killed in 2013. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'We know that around the same time he (Emwazi) is said to have gone to Syria that a group of men from the same area of London also travelled to Syria with the same ethnic background - they were arabs. 'From everything we have studied and what data shows is people typically go in groups - with friends who know each other - they usually live close by.' 'Things suggest they may well know each other but we can't substantiate it. These guys are all dead which makes it hard for us to know whether he knew them.' Ibrahim al-Mazwagi (centre), the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, is pictured here with Abu Omar al-Shishani (right), one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq . Mohammad el-Araj and Choukri Ellekhlifi, both killed in 2013, pictured in an internet café in Atmeh in Syria . Mr Maher said it appears that Emwazi survived, and has become one of the most prominent members of the Islamic State group - a fighter whose confidence and Western accent are calculated to strike fear into viewers of the group's grisly videos. Al-Mazwagi, from North London was 21 when he was killed in Syria in February last year. A graduate from Hertfordshire University, he was of Libyan origin and moved to Syria where he told his family he was doing charity work. Ellekhlifi, 22, was killed fighting alongside extremists in Syria and funded his trip by mugging people in Belgravia, London. He was one of three British men killed as their group - the Al-Nusra Front - attacked pro-government forces near the city of Aleppo on August 11. El-Araj, 23, was killed two weeks later during a firefight. Social media: The jihadis have used the power of the internet to lift the lid on the life of a terrorists in Syria . Honour: This collage, posted on social media, was made to honour al-Mazwagi and another man who died fighting . Pictures of members of the brigade have flooded social media in recent years and a video of al-Mazwagi, who is the first British jihadi known to have died in Syria, lifted the lid on life as a terrorist . Among the brigade’s most notorious alumni is Abu Omar al-Shishani, one of the most feared military commanders of the Islamic State of Syria and Iraq . Al-Shishani, a red-bearded ethnic Chechen and former sergeant in the Georgian Army - became the commander of the brigade, which was initially aligned with al-Qaeda's Jabhat al-Nusra. The group merged with other jihadists in March 2013 to form Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar [Army of Emigrants and Supporters], a larger and more structured group with a religious council. In May 2013, Shishani switched to supporting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and was named commander of the northern sector of Syria, around Aleppo. A video obtained and published by Channel 4 in 2013 shows life as an extremist in Syria - likely the experience of Emwazi before he went to fight for Islamic State. Unmasked: ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John', pictured here with American journalist Steven Sotloff, has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from London . Speaking to camera, al-Mazwagi said: 'I didn't travel across the world - I spent a lot of money and I left a lot of what I love and I left a comfortable lifestyle - just to come here and blow up some kids. 'I could have easily done that back home.' And asked when his fight will end, he added: 'When I die. I would rather fight in the path of Allah, protecting his religion, than be with my wife. 'I have got unlimited time after I die to spend with my life, I don't need to spend it right now. This week the true identity of Jihadi John was revealed to be Londoner Mohammed Emwazi. The Islamic State killer was born in Kuwait before moving to Britain at six years old. Given a council flat overlooking the Regents Canal in the exclusive Little Venice area of West London, his father found work as a minicab and delivery van driver while his mother stayed at home with Mohammed and his two younger sisters, now 25 and 23. Home: Minicab driver's son Emwazi most recently lived at a flat in Queen's Park in west London . After finishing primary school in 1999, young Mohammed moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John’s Wood. Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress. It was only after he won a place studying computing at the University of Westminster that his behaviour began to change. Friends told the Washington Post he was already talking wildly about travelling to Syria, where the uprising against Bashar al Assad was beginning in earnest. His parents reported him missing after three days but claimed it was four months before police arrived at their home and said they had information he was in Syria.","Jihadi John said to have been in first group of Londoners to fight in Syria .

"Kim Jong-Un has told North Korea's military to prepare for war against the United States, saying he wants 'to tear to pieces the Stars and Stripes'. He also said that America does not have a 'monopoly' on nuclear weapons, adding: 'The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its mainland is safe.' The comments were made yesterday after America and South Korea held joint military exercises before announcing another eight-week operation due to take place from Monday. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong Un said that America does not have the 'monopoly' on nuclear weapons, adding that: 'The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its mainland is safe.' The North Korean dictator called on the army to increase the training of elite units in response to joint military drills from the U.S. and South Korea on Friday . The aggressive North Korean statement comes at a time of rising tension on the peninsula after the communist state also upped its own military drills (pictured, Kim inspects part of a museum in Pyongyang) Operation Foal Eagle will involve around 200,000 South Korean troops and another 3,700 U.S. personnel, spread over land, sea and air. North Korea has also recently stepped up its own ground, air and naval drills, as tensions continue to rise on the fraught peninsula. KCNA, the country's state news agency, said: 'The DPRK will wage a merciless sacred war against the U.S. now that the latter has chosen confrontation. 'The prevailing situation where a great war for national reunification is at hand requires all the KPA (Korean People's Army) units to become (elite) Guard Units fully prepared for war politically and ideologically, in military technique and materially.' Kim hit out on the same day the U.S. moved a step closer to imposing new sanctions on North Korea's banks, blocking their access to hard cash. Kim said he wanted 'to tear to pieces the Stars and Stripes' and 'wage a merciless sacred war against the U.S.', according to the country's state news agency . The comments also came as the U.S. begins ratifying new laws which will place even tougher sanctions on North Korea, limiting its access to hard cash . The bill also has that ability to sanction North Korea officials over dire human rights abuses and individuals who facilitate cyberattacks on the U.S. The new legislation is partly in response to demands for tougher measures over Pyongyang's nuclear programme and the alleged hack of Sony Pictures last year. The Obama administration last month blacklisted additional North Korean officials  in response to the Sony hack,aimed at reducing the country's income from illegal weapon sales. Last week a U.N. panel investigating how North Korea avoids sanctions reported that one shipping company caught trying to smuggle jets and missiles from Cub had simply renamed its vessels, suggesting that the new sanctions may not be entirely effective. South Korea and America will carry out more joint exercises from Monday involving hundreds of thousands of troops (pictured, Kim inspects the construction site of a new science and technology centre)","Dictator Kim Jong Un threatened 'to tear to pieces the Stars and Stripes'

"Three quarters of GPs want to charge foreigners for appointments, figures show. They say too many migrants and tourists are abusing the NHS, which is already under immense pressure. Many want foreigners to be regarded as private patients and made to pay at the surgery reception either by card or cash. Three quarters of GPs want to charge foreigners for appointments as they fear too many migrants and tourists are abusing the NHS, which is already under immense pressure (stock picture) A private GP appointment typically costs £70 and from then on overseas patients would also have to pay for blood tests, scans or drugs. Ministers have warned that the NHS is becoming an ‘international health service’ and overseas patients not entitled to free care racking up bills of up to £300 million year. They have proposed a series of measures to crackdown on the problem including a pilot scheme last month to check the documents of all new patients registering with a GP. At present, GP appointments and treatment are free for all overseas patients although they are meant to pay for most hospital procedures. But family doctors say that the current system makes them a gateway for foreigners abusing free hospital treatment. Dr Kailash Chand, Deputy Chair of the British Medical Association, argues the NHS should remain free for anyone who needed to use it . This is because staff rarely bother to check patients’ nationalities and whether they should be paying as they assume that if they have a GP referral they are eligible for free NHS care. A survey of 515 GPs by Pulse magazine  found that 77 per cent were in favour of ‘upfront’ charges for foreign patients. One, Dr Zishan Syed, a GP in Maidstone, Kent, said: ‘It is a sad reality but there is abuse of the NHS by foreign visitors. ‘It is only fair that they pay upfront if they are not entitled to free care on the NHS. ‘The NHS is in trouble and it is only right that the Government stops anyone from taking advantage of a system that is already under immense pressure. Another Dr Niall Finegan, a GP in Salford, Greater Manchester pointed out that British patients don’t get free care abroad there is no reason the NHS should pay for foreigners. ‘We do not get free care abroad.’ He said. Another anonymous GP said: ‘GP should be able to charge patient as if he is private patient and give private prescription. why should we do work free of charge for patients not entitled to NHS treatment. One other doctor, who did not reveal their name said: ‘These patients need to be treated as private patient. ‘GPs should charge fee and give private prescription. Most of money should go to GP.’ But other doctors said the NHS should remain free for anyone who needed to use it. Dr Kailash Chand, Deputy Chair of the British Medical Association, which represents doctors said: ‘Quite a significant majority of GPs for as long as I have known have supported charging foreign visitors for NHS care. ‘They see this as one of the solutions for the demand. It is understandable. ‘But I think they are mistaken. I believe in universal health care. If they bring in these charges, where do you stop? This will be counterproductive.’ Last month the Department of Health announced a pilot whereby all new patients registering at a GP would have to prove they are either British citizens or if from the EU, show their European Health Insurance Card. The scheme will initially involve ten practices as part of a series of measures aimed at getting GPs in the habit of checking if patients are entitled to free care.","Figures show majority of GPs want to charge foreigners for appointments .

"The Iraqi national museum has reopened its doors twelve years after tens of thousands of artefacts were looted in the wake of the U.S. invasion in 2003. Since then around 3,000 priceless treasures, including one figurine which dates back 4,400 years, have been recovered and returned to the museum's collection. The opening was accelerated to today after a video released by ISIS fanatics earlier this week showed them destroying 3,000-year-old sculptures in Mosul, Iraq's second city. Scroll down for video . Iraq's national museum in Baghdad has re-opened twelve years after it was ransacked in the wake of the U.S. invasion during which an estimated 15,000 artefacts were taken . Since then officials have managed to recover around 3,000 items, while others were discovered hidden in secret storage rooms or were being kept safe overseas at the time of the raid . The museum is home to relics dating back at least 5,000 years to when Iraq was called Mesopotamia, widely considered to be the cradle of human civilization (pictured, statues dating to the second century BC) Speaking in Baghdad today, Iraq's prime minister Haider al-Abadi said ISIS militants had destroyed around half of the exhibits and was trying to sell the others. However, he said that each item was marked and tagged, and was calling on the international community to help thwart the 'terrorist barbarians'. He said: 'We will chase them with the world on our side. This is a serious call to the Security Council and the United Nations and all peace-loving states to chase them all. 'Damn them and their hands for what they are doing.' The opening of the museum was brought forward after ISIS militants were this week shown vandalising ancient sculptures in Mosul, Iraq's second city (a statue dating back to the eight century BC pictured left) An artefact coming from the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim and dating back to 1227 AD is displayed during the official reopening of Iraq's national museum . Iraq's prime minister today said ISIS militants had destroyed around half of the artefacts in Mosul's museum, and was attempting to smuggle the other half for a profit . Looting from Iraq's national museum began under Saddam Hussein as corrupt officials tried to move pieces out of the country, but the main raids came after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Curators locked some of the most valuable and cultural pieces in underground storage rooms, but the above ground rooms were ransacked. In total, officials estimate that 15,000 items were taken, of which about a third have been recovered. Some items recorded as stolen were later found locked in secret storage units, while others were being kept overseas at the time and were subsequently returned. Officials added that the damage could have been a lot worse, as most of the thieves were opportunistic, and had little idea of what they were looking for. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi (pictured) urged the international community to help track down the numbered and tagged relics, vowing to thwart the 'terrorist barbarians' Museum curators said many artefacts were saved because thieves did not know what they were looking for. A collection of fake jars were taken, while the valuable real versions, sitting next to them, were untouched . The museum was first opened in 1926 with the help of British author Gertrude Bell, and was subsequently added to via the funding of the German and Italian governments . In one room curators found an entire shelf of worthless fake jars had been taken while the next shelf, containing valuable originals, remained entirely intact, according to the museum's website. The museum was first opened in 1926 with the help of British author Gertrude Bell, and was subsequently added to via the funding of the German and Italian governments. The collection covers 7,000 years of history, including rare relics from Mesopotamia - as Iraq was called for much of human history - which is widely considered to be the cradle of civilization. Pillaging of Iraq's most important archeological sites continues to this day, as the country's weakened security forces are unable to protect them. Iran has today offered to protect the precious objects, with Mohammad Hassan Talebian, a senior official at Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization, saying he has written to the U.N. offering his country's services for as long as the treasures are at risk. This was the scene in Mosul museum earlier this week as ISIS soldiers too sledgehammers to some of the rarest and most valuable artefacts from the ancient Muslim world .

"Three childhood friends who survived the Second World War together have been reunited after 70 years apart. With the war coming to an end in 1945, brothers Sydney and Bernard Baker waved goodbye to their adopted home on Pwllygath Street near Bridgend, Wales - and their dear friend Doris Hayball. Along with their other brother Alan, they returned to the family home in Stamford Hill, London which they had been evacuated from five years earlier. Now thanks to a chance meeting with a couple from the town in Gran Canaria, the pair have rekindled that friendship with their fellow wartime survivor on the same Welsh street they left behind. Reunited: After 70 years apart, brother Sydney (centre) and Bernard (right) Baker have met up with old friend Doris Lugg (left) on the same street in Wales they lived on during the Second World War . Homecoming: With the war coming to an end in 1945 - Bernard (standing), Sydney (right) and their other brother Alan (left) returned home to London which they had evacuated five years earlier . Reunion: Thanks to Sydney's chance meeting with a current Pwllygath Street resident in Gran Canaria, the pair have been able to return to the street that took them in during the war - and see some old friends . 84-year-old Bernard who now lives in Essex said: 'It's wonderful coming back. I have always got a smile about being in Wales. It was a very, very happy time and it was safe for my brothers and me.' Doris, 82, still lives at her childhood home four doors down from where the Baker brothers stayed. The great-grandmother who now goes by the name Doris Lugg remembers them arriving on Pwllygath Street wearing gas masks and clutching their small suitcases. She said: 'It's really amazing to see them again. I remember them coming into the street with a lady who brought them up from Pisgah Church.' Despite the fear which gripped the country during the war, Sydney, 80, added: 'I don't remember any time being sad or unhappy.' He said bumping into current Kenfig Hill resident Jane Holder while on holiday with his wife Carole 'brought back a flood of memories of all that happened'. Jane, 50, and her husband Richard arranged for the Baker brothers to return to Bridgend yesterday, where they even managed to visit their old school Mynydd Cynffig. They had kept in touch with Ed and Laura Williams who looked after them between 1940 and 1945 but feared the links with their childhood in Wales ended when the couple died. Memories: Doris, who remembers the boys arriving in Kenfig Hill wearing gas masks and clutching their tiny suitcases, said: 'It's really amazing to see them again' Kindness: The brothers were initially homed separately but the couple who took in Alan decided they should all be staying together . Thankfully, Jane discovered that many of their former schoolmates remembered the trio - known as the Baker boys - and would be delighted to see them again. The three boys were initially sent to separate home but Doris' second cousin Ed Williams - who took in Alan - decided they should be together when he saw Sydney crying in a window of a neighbour's house. Doris said: 'He told my mother he couldn't bear it that they were parted.' Even though the brothers shared two single beds pushed together in a box room for five years, Bernard and Sydney remember their stay in Wales fondly. Sydney said: 'Laura and Ed were wonderful people - incredibly warm almost immediately. And his brother Bernard added: 'It was incredible for them to take three Jewish boys in. But they brought us up like their own children. 'I couldn't have hoped for a better, happier boyhood than I had here.'","In 1945, brothers returned to London after being evacuated five years prior .

"Berkshire Hathaway has offered the best hint yet as to who will succeed Warren Buffett at the helm of the massively successful conglomerate. And Buffett, world's most successful investor who grew the company from a failing manufacturing firm into a $485billion behemoth, says his replacement will be an even better leader than he has been. The 84-year-old released an annual letter to investors on Saturday in which he discussed his successors and the future of the company that he has run for 50 years. 'Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO - a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down,' the billionaire said in his letter to Berkshire shareholders. 'In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing,' Buffett added. Greg Abel (left), 52, leads Berkshire Hathaway Energy and has been with the company since 2000. Ajit Jain (right), 63, has been Buffett's top insurance deputy for three decades. Munger described them both as 'proven performers' Warren Buffett, 84, has run Berkshire since 1965. He's turned the company into a worldwide business in areas such as insurance, railroads, energy, food and apparel . Vice chairman Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime business partner, gave more details than ever about a potential Buffett's heir - and even named the top candidates. Munger, 91, characterized two top Berkshire executives, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, as 'proven performers who would probably be under-described as ""world-class,""' in his annual letter to shareholders. Abel, 52, leads Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Jain, 63, has been Buffett's top insurance deputy for three decades. In previous annual letters, Buffett has said that Berkshire's board had been fully aware of his chosen successor but he kept his options open for other possible candidates. He didn't name his eventual successor in this year's note to investigors, but he did discuss the qualities that person will need. 'My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency,' Buffett said. 'When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter.' Investors have long speculated about who would, or could, succeed Buffett, particularly after he was diagnosed with and then beat prostate cancer in 2012. Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charles Munger, 91, hinted at the idea that Warren Buffett's successor could be Greg Abel or Ajit Jain, both executives within the company . Neither Buffett's nor Munger's letter referred by name to Matthew Rose, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor. In Saturday's letter, Buffett strongly suggested that the potential successor already works within Berkshire. Analysts and Berkshire shareholders have speculated that Jain would succeed Buffett as CEO, according to the Wall Street Journal. Both he and Abel are longtime executives with the company. Jain has been with Berkshire since 1985, while Abel joined the company in 2000. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with a $363billion market value, and more than 80 operating businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food and apparel. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also has well over $100billion of common stock investments. 'Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire board has grown to know well,' he wrote. Age will also be a factor and Buffett said Berkshire may be best off if his successor stays on for at least a decade. 'Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job,' Buffett wrote. 'It's hard to teach a new dog old tricks. And they are not likely to retire at 65 either - or have you noticed?' Longtime partners Munger (left) joined Buffett (right) have withheld most information about potential successors for Berkshire Hathaway's CEO position .","Charles Munger and Warren Buffett released shareholders letters Saturday .

"What was meant to be a joyous and romantic evening for a newlywed couple instead became a horror scene when the groom head-butted and choked his bride. Police were called to a home at Fannie Bay in Darwin on Friday night, where they were met by the 29-year-old 'intoxicated' and 'dishevelled' groom who was still in his dress shirt after being married earlier that night.

For the first time since 2010, meteorologists predict two snow storms barreling through the country in the next seven days will engulf Florida - a usually snow-less state. It comes as cold weather records continue to fall across the country, with February declared the coldest month in New York for 81 years. The average temperature in the Big Apple over the last four weeks has been 24F - 11 degrees below normal. New York joins other metropolitan areas such as Chicago and Pittsburgh, which have also experienced their most frigid February in decades.

The only other February on record that was cold than this past month was in 1885 - when the average daily temperature was 22.7 degrees . Jay Engle, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service, told The Times: 'It was like the most sick month you can think of.'

"After Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris and the abuse of young, vulnerable women in Bradford, you’d be forgiven for thinking there has been a sea change. That any man who transgresses against a woman will be stopped; that women will finally be believed; that we can trust the judicial system. My experience over the past two very difficult and distressing years proves the opposite is true. When I bought my house in October 2012 in the breathtakingly beautiful Yorkshire Dales, with a cottage on site for my assistant/ animal behaviourist, Nic, who has worked for me for seven years, I thought we would be able to live in peace. The caretaker had warned me as he left the property about the farmer next door, saying he and the farmer had been at it ‘hammer and tongs’ for years. Liz Jones, pictured, has suffered an ordeal at the hands of a neighbour near the home she bought in 2012 . Liz moved to the stone farmhouse in Richmond, in the picturesque north Yorkshire dales . Liz, pictured, said since moving to her house, she and her neighbour Nic have been stalked by a farmer . The farmer, Jamie Close, who lives alone, is 43, and deaf and partially dumb. Being profoundly deaf myself, I immediately empathised. As two single women in a remote area, Nic and I keep our counsel. We don’t really socialise, as neither of us have time. As single women, even going to the pub can be misconstrued. But living just 500 yards from Jamie’s farm, we tried to be polite good, helpful neighbours, and at first we all got on OK. I rented one of his fields for my horses, at a cost of £3,000 a year. Nic quickly learned sign language and would help Jamie out by phoning people on his behalf. When Jamie’s dog was run over, Nic took it to the vet, and phoned them daily for updates. But it being a small rural area, where locals know everything about each other, we soon learned that Jamie had been cautioned not long before we moved in for stalking his ex-girlfriend, who had moved out of the area to avoid him, so we made sure to lock our doors. We had moved unwittingly into an already volatile situation. And then, in the summer of 2013, the abuse of Nic started. It was harmless, if creepy, at first. Jamie began to spy on her; we would catch him looking out of his window – we are the only two properties on our dead-end lane – just standing, staring. Liz believes that this dead rabbit, which Nic found on her doorstep was part of the intimidation campaign . Liz's house, left, is only a few hundred yards away from farmer Jamie Close, who lives down the lane, right . And then the stalking took on a sexual nature. He started to bombard Nic with bizarrely worded, obscene text messages such as ‘I want you, together love cuddle’, ‘ready hard play sex’ and ‘Want love sex, b*** job’. The sexual stuff was never aimed at me; he often made the sign for ‘old woman’ at me, by dragging two fingers down his face from his eyes, indicating bags and lines. If a male friend posted anything on Nic’s Facebook page, Jamie would shout: ‘Die! Die! Die!’ He said if Nic married him, she could have money; if she refused, she must ‘f*** off!’, and I must leave. ‘You!’ he said to me. ‘Go south!’ He even erected a For Sale sign in my garden. Liz believes that Jamie Close even erected a 'For Sale' sign in her garden and warned her that she should 'go south' One weekend, he placed a sex toy on Nic’s doorstep. He painted the word ‘Witch’ on the side of my barn. He placed a dead rabbit on her doorstep. He would pin notes to our doors, accusing Nic of liking young boys, and to me he scrawled just two words: ‘Finished you.’ Every time a note appeared, I got chest pains. He would get back to his farm late at night, having been drinking, and bang on Nic’s front door. He would appear in my hallway uninvited. He made our lives in this seemingly idyllic, tranquil location, a living hell. Nic understandably became depressed, and was put on medication. She was too scared to leave her cottage, which was tricky, as her job is to look after animals. She threatened to kill herself. Finally, she went to see Jamie’s sister, who lives four miles away. Nic didn’t want to involve the police, as Jamie obviously needed help. The sister said she was afraid the situation would escalate, and that her brother would never change, but she would talk to him. Meanwhile his mother said she was scared of him, as he once went for his ex-girlfriend with a pitchfork in front of her. But nonetheless his mother, when I asked for her help, also told me I should sell my house, as ‘we were here first’. Nothing changed. Nic went to the family again. This time, the sister called the police. After many hours of taking statements, the police, who to their credit were endlessly sympathetic and helpful, gave Jamie a harassment notice. They told us to get walkie-talkies (there is scant mobile signal in our area), but what use I’d be to Nic against a man who is 22st and over 6ft, I’ve no idea. And of course he persisted with the stalking and the harassment, and so finally, last month, he was arrested and released on bail. A date for a court hearing was set. We discovered Jamie had in fact been cautioned before for a very similar offence, and so it seemed likely he would receive a custodial sentence, or be made to relocate. When Nic and I were told this, we said to each other: How will six months in prison help him? He will just be released and do it again. In court last Monday, Jamie pleaded guilty. And the sentence? He was ordered to pay £100 and given a restraining order. One hundred pounds. That is less than I was fined for speeding. In court, his defence lawyer stated that ‘there’s a certain economy of words in the deaf community that outsiders can find brutally frank’. I think those texts were very, very clear. Liz said Jamie Close appeared in court last Monday for stalking and harassment and received a £100 fine . To top it all, I’ve just received a letter from the family’s solicitor, saying I am not to talk to Jamie because ‘he is a vulnerable adult handicapped by his inability to hear, he is easily harmed and the harm can be reflected in his behaviour’. To me, this clearly implies that his two latest victims are in fact responsible! There has been no apology, and our horses now face eviction from his field. If Nic was to do what Jamie’s ex did, and move away, she’d lose her job. We thought about renting her a cottage in a nearby village, but she feels he would only find her again. I have only ever waved hello to him, given him a cheery thumbs-up for slowing his tractor when I am walking my dogs, and ordered him pizza after a hard day’s sheep shearing. Making excuses for and underestimating his behaviour is unhelpful to all involved; and as a vulnerable adult, surely he shouldn’t be living with barely any human contact? And what about my employee? She is a vulnerable adult: she is depressed and often here alone, as I have to travel to work. Liz said that Jamie Close's family said that she could sell her house was they 'were here first' Giving Jamie a restraining order is a joke. He ignored the last one. Even last week he has been ducking behind his Land Rover, spying on Nic. In our rare lighter moments, Nic will joke, as she heads outside in a floor-length coat and hat, wellies, no make-up, hair scragged back, ‘Could I be any less attractive?’ Even a burka is no defence against male fantasy. Men who abuse women are often victims, too. Jamie has no boundaries: he even asked Nic what type of tampon she uses, and her method of contraception. He was set up, alone, in a remote farm 20 years ago, which to me seems the worst possible solution for a man already isolated by his disability. We of course don’t want the disabled in care homes or hospitals or institutions, but to leave them on their own, to prey on an unsuspecting neighbour? What ever happened to the maiden aunt or bachelor uncle living with their family? Care in the community is clearly a joke. We have a stereotypical view of the abuser: a showbiz type who likes a bit of slap and tickle, an evil rapist. But often an abuser is just very sad. No man would want to behave in this way, surely? All Jamie wants is a wife, and to be looked after. I believe he is a nice person, generous and good with children. He has even been helpful, fetching a trailer when my thoroughbred had to be rushed to hospital. But he can’t control, on his own, his obsession. It is the right of my assistant and friend to live in peace, for her to do her job, and be without fear. It is the right of the stalker and abuser to get help. Liz said she feels sorry for Jamie Close, suggesting that he should also receive the help he deserves .","Liz Jones and her employee Nic have been stalked by a farmer .

"A trial collapsed when a Muslim swore an oath on the Bible instead of the Koran. Michael Davies was accused of attempted robbery until it emerged a witness had taken the oath on the wrong book. The judge, Recorder Patrick Thompson, said the trial at Liverpool Crown Court could not proceed, adding: 'It is probably best if a fresh jury who doesn't think we're all totally incompetent hears this case.' Collapsed: The trial was halted after a Muslim man accidentally swore an oath on the Bible instead of the Koran . Davies, 38, had denied trying to rob a kebab shop in Birkenhead while armed with a hammer last summer. But during the hearing it emerged the takeaway's manager Kevin Kurt had sworn an oath on the wrong holy book. Asked if he had ever bought stolen goods from Davies, he said it would be 'against my religion'. John Weate, defending, asked him: 'Are you a Christian?' He replied: 'No, I'm a Muslim.' Mr Kurt was not given the option of using a different holy book. Mr Recorder Thompson said it was not the takeaway boss's fault. Holy Book: Christians swear on the Bible when they are called in court . Followers of other faiths are given copies of their sacred texts, with Muslims swearing on the Koran and Jews on the Old Testament, for example. Atheists are allowed to 'solemnly, sincerely and truly affirm' instead of swearing. Discharging the jury, Mr Recorder Thompson said: 'The difficulty that arose and I will be very straight about this, is you have heard evidence from the witness on oath, just like you all swore an oath. 'Unfortunately it was sworn on the Bible and he just informed us he is a Muslim, which means I can't accept his evidence and neither can you, because it was sworn on the wrong holy book. 'We have to start the case again.' Mr Recorder Thompson said if the trial restarted, it would not be expected to finish this week. He added: 'It is regrettable. It could have been worse. If he had concluded his evidence, we might never have found out.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Man accused of attempted robbery will now have trial restarted .

"Gallipoli is a burial ground. A terrible reminder of the violence of war. It’s where men of all ages, neighbourhoods and nationalities were stripped down to their common human thread of flesh and blood and bone. A remarkable set of circumstances we call The Lost Stories of Anzac, which airs on 60 Minutes, at 8.10pm on the Nine Network tonight. Scroll down for video . Richard Vines and Ashley Vines at Baby 700. The hill which was known as Baby 700, was one of the main Australian objectives at the dawn landing on 25 April 1915, which included a wounded Ashley Vines Snr . They landed on the wrong beach at the wrong time. Liz Hayes joins relatives at Gallipoli to trace the steps of the unknown heroes among the ANZAC troops . Primary schoolmates Ashley Vines (left) and Allan Vowles (right). Liz Hayes tells a remarkable story of circumstance which leads to the pair being reunited on the bloody battlefields of Gallipoli and how Allan would save Ashley's life . I went there with a number of family members, all of whom were learning for the first time what had happened to their Gallipoli soldiers. And I watched as they were confronted by the horror and the sadness, the brutality and the bravery that had occurred. It was all felt deeply by 21-year-old Ashley Vines. Richard Vines, Ashley Vines and Gallipoli historian Michael McKernan are pictured in the grounds of Scotch College, which has played host to five generations of the Vines family. Ashley (middle) and his great grandfather were both vice-captain of the cricket team, 100 years apart . 60 Minutes reporter Liz Hayes wrote for Daily Mail Australia that 'I went there with a number of family members, all who were learning for the first time what had happened to their Gallipoli soldiers. And I watched as they were confronted by the horror and the sadness, the brutality and the bravery that had occurred' He carries his great grandfather’s name. Both were vice-captains at Melbourne Scotch College and both were great sportsmen. The difference is, 100 years ago, Ashley senior went to war. I could see that as he and his dad Richard walked the trenches and looked up at the cliffs from Anzac Cove … Ashley suddenly understood what it must have been like. Ashley Vines snr was in the second wave of Australians to hit the shore on April 25th, 1915 and even as he and his mates saw the diggers in front of them being mowed down … they still ran forward. Richard and Ashley Vines jnr at Gallipoli to retrace the steps of Ashley Vines snr, 'I could not even imagine getitng off a boat with all these other Australians and almost facing certain death' Nearing the top of the cliffs, Ashley Vines was shot. But in what was an extraordinary act of courage, he survived with the help of a schoolmate. Allan Vowles had not seen his schoolmate since kindergarten, but out here in the battlefield now littered with bodies … he recognised Ashley Vines and for the next five hours, dodging bullets, helped carry him back down to the beach to safety. It is a story that strikes a very emotional chord. Like all of us, 21-year-old Ashley Vines and his dad, Richard, are in awe of the friendship and bravery displayed that day. But there is something else too … the realisation that had Allan not saved their great grandfather and grandfather … today neither of them would be standing at Gallipoli. The very best and very worst took place at Gallipoli. As I walked amongst the bodies now buried in cemetery after cemetery I couldn’t help but feel terribly sad. 'Initially they thought, let's stick together, why don't we go in and form a public schools company and we'll fight together'. The historian tells the relatives of Ashley Vines snr how he came about to be fighting in Gallipoli with some of his closest mates . I understand why we cling to those stories of great Australian mateship and courage; the humanity that still survived despite the horrors that engulfed them all … because without them, I can only feel despair. The truth is, there was little else to celebrate about this battle.

"Surgery: Angelina Jolie had a preventative mastectomy but a survey found one in four British women are afraid to find out if they are at risk . British women at risk of ovarian cancer have been accused of ‘burying their heads in the sand’ after a quarter of respondents to a new survey admitted they would be ‘too scared’ to undergo DNA tests to find out whether they had a 50 per cent genetic chance of developing the disease. In the same survey, one in three claimed to have a family history of the disease, but 40 per cent said they had taken no action yet to find out their own genetic risk. Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynaecological cancer, killing one woman every two hours in Britain. There are more than 7,000 new UK diagnoses each year, a third of which are caught at a late stage, due to lack of awareness of the symptoms earlier on. Almost one in five cases of ovarian cancer are due to a mutation in the BRCA1/2 gene, which also increases the chances of developing breast cancer to 87 per cent and is the cause of one in ten cases. Genetic testing is offered on the NHS to any woman with a family history of either disease who requests it, and now campaigners want screening to be offered to all patients at the point of diagnosis. Many who test positive for the BRCA gene mutation choose to have preventative surgery – a mastectomy (surgical removal of the breasts) and removal of the female reproductive organs – which reduces the risk of disease to ‘almost nothing’, according to experts. In 2013, actress Angelina Jolie became the highest-profile star to undergo a preventative mastectomy after discovering she carried the BRCA gene. Jolie has said she is considering surgery to remove her ovaries. In the months after her revelation, referrals for genetic testing in Britain doubled to 4,847 compared with 1,981 referrals in the same period in 2012, according to figures from Cancer Research UK. Whether the ‘Jolie effect’ has been sustained remains to be seen, as the UK Genetic Testing Network has not released up-to-date figures. Charity Ovarian Cancer Action released their figures ahead of Ovarian Cancer Action Month this month and are calling for women to be ‘BRCA aware’ by completing an online risk calculator on their website, ovarian.org.uk. Katherine Taylor, chief executive of the charity, said: ‘Knowing that you’re at greater risk of developing cancer can be frightening but the benefits of knowing far outweigh a temptation to bury your head in the sand.’ There’s no screening tool or routine testing for ovarian cancer, as there is with breast cancer, and symptoms are often confused, by both women and doctors, for other conditions. Of the women surveyed, more than half were unaware that persistent stomach pains and bloating could be a sign, while 33 per cent said they didn’t know of any symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. ‘We want women to know there is support and information given before and after genetic testing, and surgery is not the only option,’ added Taylor.","Ovarian cancer is most deadly gynaecological cancer, killing one woman every two hours in Britain .

"Jasem Emwazi took his son Mohammed (pictured) to London when the boy was six years old . The father of Jihadi John was a police officer in Kuwait before the family moved to Britain, according to a former friend. Jasem Emwazi took his wife, children and eldest son Mohammed, then six, to start a new life in London in 1994. 'Jasem was in the police like many Bedoons,' said the friend. Meanwhile, a senior Kuwaiti military source suggested that, in common with many of his Bedoon ethnic group who originally stemmed from Southern Iraq, Mr Emwazi would have found it difficult to regain his police job in Kuwait following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the 1991 Gulf War. 'Many Bedoon joined the Kuwaiti police and military in the 70s and 80s, even though they were not citizens of Kuwait,' said the friend who knew the family when they lived in the scruffy enclave of Taima, ten miles from Kuwait City. Recently retired Kuwait army colonel Fahad Al-Shilaimi said many of the stateless Bedoon were sacked from the police in the early 1990s. 'In the days after Saddam's men left, anyone with a link to Iraq found their loyalty questioned, and many were sacked. Perhaps that was the reason the family left Kuwait.' He added that the Kuwaiti authorities would now be investigating Mohammed Emwazi's activities in Kuwait when he returned there for a computer job in 2009-10. The Kuwaiti Ministry of the Interior is conducting a 'major investigation' into Jihadi John's eight months in the emirate, a senior security expert said. 'They will be looking into every facet of his life: his friends, his colleagues, his girlfriend, his communications,' said Al-Shilaimi. 'They will want to know which mosque he went to and who he spent time with. Many will be interrogated as the ministry wants to make sure any IS sympathisers are identified.' The colonel also said that MI5 may have 'failed' the Kuwaitis by not alerting them to Emwazi's trip there in 2009, only months after he was deported from Tanzania. 'It is concerning that Kuwait may have been failed by MI5. If we had known, we could have questioned him or put him under surveillance,' he said.","The father of Jihadi John was a Kuwait policemen before moving to UK .

"A father-and-son spy team from North Korea has been found working inside two agencies at the United Nations. Kim Su Gwang, 38, was working at the headquarters of The World Food Programme in Rome while his father Kim Yong Nam, 67, was based in Paris for the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco). Kim Young Nam's daughter, Kim Su Gyong, who was based at the Korean United Development Bank in Pyongyang, was also identified as 'engaged in financial activities under false pretences in order to conceal the involvement of her country.' Spies: Members of Kim Jong-Un's intelligence services were found working inside two agencies in the United Nations . The trio were exposed in a report for a UN panel of experts, which described both as intelligence officers 'operating under the cover of a position as an international civil servant'. Neither men remain in their positions while all three have had their assets frozen. The two men were named as members of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), the North Korean intelligence agency which is responsible for clandestine operations abroad. Kim Su Gwang, who has four known aliases, was named as the son of Kim Yong Nam. Peter Smerdon, a WFP spokesman in Rome, said: 'WFP staff are international civil servants. As such they must remain independent of any authority outside their organisation and their conduct must reflect that independence.' Humanitarian activities by the UN, as well as private relief groups, constitute the longest ongoing engagement between the hermit state and the international community. During the 1990s, the UN agency supplied millions of people with food during a famine killed up to five per cent of the pre-crisis population. John Swenson-Wright, the head of the Asia Programme at Chatham House, told The Telegraph this could explain why North Korean intelligence chose to target the WFP. 'It may be that the North Koreans questioned the independence and objectivity of the WFP's efforts,' he said. 'It would be difficult to convince them that your interest is purely humanitarian and you won't be gathering sensitive information.' He said that North Korea was keen to conceal the extent of hardship within the country. 'There is an instinctive desire to limit access to information, even the most basic kinds of information which we would not consider controversial, such as where poverty is concentrated,' he said. North Korea's bankrupt regime is desperately short of funds meaning diplomats, embassies - and intelligence officers - have to self finance. Profits they earn through legal, or illegal, means are sent back to Pyongyang. Aid: North Koreans prepare the salt pans in Nampo for salt production as part of a project organised by the World Food Programme. A member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau infiltrated the UN agency . Harvesting rice: The WFP is one of the few international organisations with a presence inside North Korea which is thought to be why it was targeted by intelligence services . The same UN report says that other North Korean intelligence officers were arrested at an unnamed airport in South East Asia while carrying $450,000 (£292,000) in cash. The draft version of the report redacts the names of the countries and companies involved, but states the money was 'suspected to be proceeds from an arms transaction'. The WFP still has a presence inside North Korea. Mr Smerdon said the agency was helping 1.1 million women and children across the country who 'suffer from chronic malnutrition due to a diet lacking in key micro-nutrients'. North Korea leverages information collected by four intelligence organisations to plan and formulate internal policy and to undermine the political stability of South Korea, according to the US Department of Defense. The report said agents of the RGB North Korea's main intelligence agency, were using international organisations and were using those positions to support activities aimed at skirting sanctions.","Kim Su Gwang worked at the The World Food Programme in Rome .

"The Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago welcomed a yet to be named baby gorilla this week that will be on view for visitors on Saturday. The newborn will join six other gorillas including her 2-year-old half-sisters Nayembi and Patty, born at the zoo in fall 2012. The baby does not yet have a name but the zoo is taking suggestions from donors. She will also be on view with her dad Kwan, a 25-year-old silverback and her 27-year-old mom Bahati in the zoo's Regenstein Center for African Apes, reports The Chicago Tribune. The zoo said they are being 'cautiously optimistic' about the baby's health. Scroll down for video . New addition: Mom Bahati holds her newborn western lowland gorilla baby at the Lincoln Park Zoo . 'The infant is looking very strong; it's clinging tightly to mom, and we're seeing a really good pattern of nursing for several minutes from both breasts then taking a nap afterward,' said Maureen Leahy, curator of primates to The Chicago Tribune. The Zoo explains that the baby is completely dependent on her mom and dad for the time being. 'At this stage, although the infant can cling on and sort of support herself, she can't do it for very long,' Leahy said. 'Mom will hold her close and tight to her chest even when she's out and about or climbing. We look for her to support the baby's head, very much like humans.' Nourishment: The as yet unnamed infant was born on February 24 and appears to be doing well . Kwan is keeping a watchful eye on the baby to ensure that she stays out of harm's way. Zoo workers watched the child 24/7 for 72 hours after she was born on February 24. The baby was peeing and pooping normally which means that she was being fed adequately by her mother's breast milk. 'He is doing a really good job keeping a watchful eye over the new mom and infant,' Leahy said. Cuddles: Bahati hold her baby closely to ensure that she remains out of harms way at the Lincoln park zoo . New world: The unnamed baby gorilla looks at the new world with open eyes as she is cradled by her mother . 'The two toddlers are very curious; they've been approaching a lot and touching the infant, but when they start getting too bold, Kwan will come over and sit down next to Bahati and kind of cue the toddlers to take a step back and give the new mom a break.' Bahati last gave birth in in 2004. Her two children are now adults and live in other Association of Zoos and Aquariums accredited zoos. Western lowland gorillas are endangered in central Africa because of their loss of habitat and poaching. The Ebola outbreak also causes new concerns. 'That is a virus that can affect ape populations as well as humans,' Leahy said. 'We don't yet know the toll on wild gorillas and chimpanzees.' Kwan and Bahati were made to breed as a part of the Western Lowland Gorilla Species Survival Plan. Keeping a watchful eye: Both Bahati and Kwan are being very protective of their newborn baby gorilla . Holding on: 'At this stage, although the infant can cling on and sort of support herself, she can't do it for very long,' the curator of primates at the zoo said .","The Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago welcomed a yet to be named baby gorilla this week that will be on view for visitors on Saturday .

"Tragic: Alan Cartwright, pictured, was stabbed to death as he cycled along a north London street . The sister of a 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death as he cycled along a north London street with his friends has paid tribute to her brother who was full of 'laughter and joys.' Alan Cartwright was killed after being confronted by three men in Caledonian Road, Islington, London, on Friday evening. He managed to continue cycling a short distance after he was stabbed, but collapsed and died in the street shortly afterwards. The attackers stole two of the teenager's friends' bikes before they fled, police said. A murder probe has been launched and police are hunting for the three attackers. Alan's sister Cherrie organised a candlelit vigil for her brother on Saturday night, near to the spot where he was killed. She told Sky News: 'It's deeply affected all of us. 'He was every sort of personality you can think of, really, all wrapped in one. He had his moments, but he beat them with his laughter and his jokes and joys.' She said the family still knew little about what had happened to the teenager on Friday evening. Officers are currently analysing CCTV footage in the area for clues as to the identity of the teenager's attackers. A post-mortem is also due to take place. Friends took to Twitter to pay tribute to Alan, known by the nickname Little Al. One person posted on Twitter in tribute to the 15-year-old and said: 'So sad that another Islington kid taken so soon. Thinking of your family at this sad time.' Another added: 'Devastated isn't the word! RIP Alan.' Former EastEnders actor Brooke Kinsella, whose 16-year-old brother Ben was knifed to death in north London in 2008, said: 'Another young boy lost to knife crime, another family destroyed. Sickening, cowardly, senseless culture. Heart is weary #PutDownYourKnives' Ms Kinsella has been a prominent and tireless anti-knife crime campaigner in the wake of her brother's death. Tributes have been left at the scene, following the murder which took place at about 7.30pm on Friday. One handwritten note attached to a bouquet of flowers reads, 'we are lost for words for what has happened'. A statement from the Metropolitan Police said: 'At this early stage it is believed the victim was cycling north on Caledonian Road with friends when they were attacked, near the junction of Copenhagen Street, by three males who were walking in the opposite direction. Alan Cartwright was cycling with friends when he suffered a single stab wound and later collapsed and died . 'The victim suffered a single stab wound during the attack and two other members of the group had their bikes stolen. The victim managed to cycle further up Caledonian Road before collapsing. 'The suspects made off from the scene, continuing south down Caledonian Road.' Anyone with information is asked to contact police. Tributes: Candles, photographs and flowers were all laid at Caledonian Road, where Alan was killed .

"Police say a Massachusetts woman allowed her 2-year-old daughter to drink her margarita at a restaurant and poured some of it into the girl's sippy cup. Sheldy Nelson, 41, of Lynn, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a child endangerment charge in Salem District court in connection with the August incident. She was held on $1,000 bond.

"Relatives of Mohammed Emwazi (pictured as a child) say they have been forced to flee their homes for fear of being targeted by reprisal attacks . Terrified relatives of Mohammed Emwazi want to change their identities over fears of revenge at tacks, friends said yesterday. The jihadi’s parents have gone into hiding and are ‘living in fear’ that they and their children could be targeted by those demanding revenge. Friends spoke out to defend the family – said to be moderate Muslims who had never supported extremism – fled their home in affluent Maida Vale, West London, before he was revealed to be the terrorist killer Jihadi John, and have not been seen since. His Kuwaiti parents and their five other children – who the Mail has decided not to name – plan to change their identities to escape his notoriety and believe they will have to start new lives, away from London. A close friend said: ‘I spoke to his sister and she is devastated. They are having to move, to change their identities. They are going through a very hard time. ‘This [revealing Emwazi’s identity] puts them at risk – they could be attacked by racists – and they have done nothing wrong. It’s not fair. ‘They are a good innocent family. This is not their fault, this [extremism] is not something the family would support in any way. 'But this is London – you can’t control what your kid does when they are an adult and go out and do their own thing.’ Emwazi was born in Kuwait, where he and his family belonged to the stateless Bidoun group of people of Iraqi origin, who complain they are denied citizenship and full access to education, work and healthcare in the emirate. His parents decided to move in 1993 when he was six and their two eldest daughters only toddlers, suggesting they were seeking a better education and future for their children in Britain. At St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school he was the only Muslim pupil in his class. At secondary school, Quintin Kynaston in St John’s Wood, Emwazi was nicknamed ‘Little Mo’ because of his thin frame and was targeted by bullies from another school. The family are asking to be given new identities after leaving their home in Maida Vale, west London (pictured), after their son was unmasked as killer Jihadi John . A former school friend said the gang of 15 and 16-year-olds would wait outside Quintin Kynaston for Emwazi, then 14. ‘They would steal his lunch money and push him around a bit,’ the friend said. ‘He was very quiet and a bit scrawny back then. 'It must have been terrifying for him to have four or five guys ganging up on him like that. He used to be a pretty normal kid, he was religious but in no way radical. ‘Whatever caused him to be what he has become happened after he left school.’ The football-mad youngster was said to have become increasingly strict about observing his Muslim faith as he reached his teens, when his younger sisters also began to wear the hijab. Yesterday it was claimed Emwazi also featured in the video of the Jordanian pilot Mouath al- Kasaesbeh being burnt alive in a cage by IS last month. He is said to have been one of the masked IS fighters cradling their weapons behind the pilot.","Parents and five siblings have fled home in Maida Vale, west London .

"The search for missing three-year-old William Tyrell has taken an international turn, with authorities in dozens of far-reaching countries expected to join the cause. NSW Crime Stoppers have urged Crime Stoppers websites in 26 countries to post a message about William's abduction last year, urging anybody with information on the case to contact Australian police. The plea has been sent to places as far-flung as Europe and America, urging them to post articles about three-year-old William, who went missing from his home in grandmother's home on the NSW north coast on September 12, reports the Sunday Telegraph. Scroll down for video . NSW Crime Stoppers have urged Crime Stoppers websites in 26 countries to post a message about William's abduction, urging anybody with information to contact Australian police . NSW Crime Stoppers CEO Peter Price said they're expecting a plethora of further countries to jump on board. 'We're using the global crime stoppers network to broaden the communications appeal relating to his disappearance,' Mr Price said. 'We're hoping that somebody might recognise him.' While the global call to action may be helpful, NSW Homicide Squad detective Gary Jubelin said there is no evidence to suggest William had been taken overseas. The global campaign comes after the parents of missing three-year-old William issued a heartfelt plea to find their son after he vanished without a trace five months ago. The Tyrell family  issued a heartbreaking letter revealing William's toys remained untouched and that everyday since he disappeared had been a living nightmare. 'We wake up every day hoping this nightmare will be over. We desperately miss William, he's our baby boy; our funny, cheeky, gorgeous boy,' they said. The parents of missing three-year-old William Tyrell broke their silence by issuing a heartbreaking letter revealing William's Spiderman toys remained untouched since he disappeared in September . His parents say walking past his bedroom is painful beyond words and they desperately want their little boy home where he belongs . The letter, given to Daily Mail Australia by police, goes on to say their family home is too quiet without him. 'William's Spiderman toys remain untouched and there is such a huge hole in hearts,' they wrote. 'Walking past his bedroom is painful beyond words and having to do the day to day activities just reinforces that. 'Our sadness is overwhelming, as parents you wish for your children to have a long, happy and loving future. We desperately want that for our little William. 'We desperately want our little boy home where he belongs.' William was abducted from the yard of his grandmother's home in Kendall on the NSW north coast on September 12 last year wearing his favourite Spiderman costume. The family's heartfelt plea comes as detectives searching for the young boy vowed they would be looking to interview everyone within a kilometre of his grandmother's home. The latest move from police is a clear sign they are upping the intensity of the investigation and now believe he was abducted, The Australian reports. 'This is not a little boy lost story. This is not a child that wandered off. We think there's been human intervention,' NSW Police Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin said. Detectives haven't ruled out the possibility that the person responsible for abducting William loitered outside his grandmother's home before snatching the three-year-old as soon as he was alone. Police now want to speak to everyone that was in a 1km radius of the home between 10am and 11am that day. 'This is not a public appeal. We're saying: 'If you're in there, you'd better come forward',' Inspector Jubelin said. 'If you were in the area and did not come forward, we would have grave concerns and a certain amount of suspicion would be attached. 'It's a huge coincidence that you have a situation where a young boy has been unsupervised, only for a very short moment, and someone has come into contact with him at the time,' he told AAP, noting how quiet the street is. NSW Police Homicide Squad Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin has taken over the case and warned police would speak to everyone within a 1km radius of where William went missing . The family's heartfelt plea comes as detectives searching for the young boy vowed they would be looking to interview everyone within a kilometre of his grandmother's home . After five long months of investigation, police say that William Tyrell was abducted and did not simply wander off and become lost from his grandmother's home . To reinforce the point police believed the three-year-old was abducted Inspector Jubelin described it as a 'ground zero operation' and that they were basically starting the investigation from scratch again. He maintained that police would now 'consider every possibility' and 'everyone's a suspect'. As opposed to a normal appeal for public information, anyone who fits the criteria and doesn't come forward will attract police suspicion. 'If they don't come forward to police, we would have some concern and attach a certain amount of suspicion to anyone that doesn't want to help police in an investigation of this nature,' Det Insp Jubelin said. Detectives haven't ruled out the possibility that the person responsible for abducting William loitered outside his grandmother's home before snatching the three-year-old as soon as he was alone . Meanwhile concerned locals and two psychics have joined the hunt for the abductor in Australia's most baffling missing child case, sending police a photograph of a mystery man and a drawing of the possible kidnapper. The photograph of a man with folded arms standing near police, described as 'pale, lanky and walks with a limp', has emerged as fresh evidence in the search. The local searcher who photographed 'the man with the folded arms' decided to speak out but as the mystery of missing toddler  entered its fifth baffling month. She sent a photograph of the man to police late last year, but has not heard back. A psychic has also hand drawn a cryptic picture of the man she believes may have abducted William. This was the scene of the search for missing William Tyrell near Kendall on the NSW Mid North Coast last September for nine days after he went missing . NSW Mid North Coast locals (pictured) join in the search last September for missing William Tyrell . While NSW police would not confirm whether they were working on leads from the clairvoyants, police around Australia have a long history of working with clairvoyants on missing persons and murder cases. Mid North Coast locals assembled on day one of the search for William after he vanished on September 12 from his grandmother's home at Kendall, 35km south of Port Macquarie, say five months on they still want to help in the search for the little boy. William was wearing his favourite Spiderman costume and playing with his younger sister in the yard at their grandmother's home during a visit to Kendall with their mother from Sydney, when he disappeared. Fears that the little boy may have wandered off into the bush gave way to graver doubts as police scoured fields, dams and roads through the nearby forest for clues. This is the street where William Tyrell was visiting his grandmother when he vanished last September . Police and SES volunteers scoured the bush and forest for clues to William Tyrell but found nothing . Last month police searched this house (pictured) in Bonny Hills, NSW, for traces of William but have yet to release details of the forensic analysis . Kendall's tiny community rallied around William's desperate family and Mid North Coast residents turned up to help with the search. A command post was set up and volunteers provided food for the searchers. AS the days rolled by, police admitted William's chances of survival if he had wandered off alone were slim. They widened the search, theorising that the boy may have been thrown from a vehicle after being abducted. Police Strike Force Rossann engaged hundreds of volunteers in the search of bushland around the home for any sign of William. Anyone with information about William's disappearance should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. The community flocked to Kendall to help in the search and got behind William Tyrell's desperate family who still have no idea where the little boy could be . Psychics are sending their readings and drawings into police to try and solve the baffling mystery which has been going on for five months since the initial fruitles search (above) at Kendall in NSW .","NSW Crime Stoppers have urged 26 countries to join the cause .

"Hundreds of ISIS extremists like Mohammed Emwazi have been free to leave Britain because they are not being properly monitored . Hundreds of ISIS extremists like Mohammed Emwazi have been free to leave Britain because they were not being properly monitored by the security services, the Government has admitted. Young men on the fringes of terror groups were not investigated thoroughly by the police and intelligence agencies, allowing them to leave for Syria, a report has revealed. It has also been revealed that MI5 and Scotland Yard are observing  3,000 people in the UK that they fear could become another Jihadi John. Counter-terror investigators from the police and security services have launched Project Danube, a joint unit which will examine 'the levels of risk posed by low-level subjects of interest', The Times reported. The operation will monitor people who were previously not thoroughly examined as officers followed leads which posed a greater risk. The move will heap yet more pressure on Britain's intelligence agencies, which are said to have more than 3,000 fanatics in the UK on their terror watch list. Many of these are feared to be 'lone wolves' who have never joined a terrorist group or travelled abroad. The figure is far higher than previous estimates, which put the number of extremists being monitored in 2007 at 2,000. The number of potentially dangerous men and women grew with the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, according to the Financial Times. Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the think-tank Rusi, said: 'There have always been a lot of people [under watch]. But the perception for a long time was that the numbers had plateaued. 'Now there is a whole new layer on top of that because the noise from ISIS in Syria and Iraq is so loud it is attracting others.' The new focus on individuals rather than terrorist networks is thought to be a reaction to the cases of Emwazi  and the killers of Lee Rigby - Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) Adebolajo, one of the men who brutally murdered Lee Rigby (pictured), was part of the same radicalised group as Emwazi . The new focus on individuals rather than terrorist networks is thought to be a reaction to the cases of Emwazi - unmasked as Jihadi John this week - and the killers of  Lee Rigby. Adebolajo, one of the men who brutally murdered the fusilier in a street in Woolwich, and Emwazi were part of the same radicalised group that emerged in London in 2007. Both tried to travel to Somalia to join terrorists Al-Shabaab but were stopped by intelligence officers, after which they are said to have remained on MI5's watchlist. Former head of MI6 Sir John Sawers said the threat from terrorism in Britain had gone up over the last three years . Emwazi was on a no-fly list but was still able to leave Britain by ferry, from where he made his way to Syria, it is believed. Security chiefs have warned senior MPs that if they are to successfully monitor more people, especially those who are not part of conventional terrorist groups, they will need more powers, including those allowing them to snoop on online communications. Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, said: 'Every society has to set out to what extent can the authorities intrude on individuals' privacies in order to protect the wider society - and maybe that balance is shifting a bit. 'Certainly the threat that we face from terrorists here in the UK has gone up over the last three years and there has to be some response to that. 'What we don't want to do is wait for some ghastly 7/7-style terrorist attack here in the UK before political opinion changes,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. David Cameron yesterday voiced his support for the security services. He said: 'They are having to make incredibly difficult judgements, and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf. 'I think while we are in the middle of this vast effort to make sure British citizens are safe, the most important thing is to get behind them.'","Hundreds of extremists not properly monitored were left free to leave UK .

"There were violent clashes on the streets of Newcastle today as hundreds of demonstrators from controversial anti-Islam group Pegida were met by a 2,000-strong counter-protest. Around 400 people from the far-right group were shouted down by the counter-demonstration, with scuffles breaking out as the rally made its way through the city centre, leading to five arrests.

Seven-year-old Afif Uzzaman, pictured, from Newcastle upon Tyne joined with counter protesters who were objecting to Pegida's march . This woman posed in front of a line of police officers keeping the rival groups of protesters apart as they demonstrated in Newcastle today . The demonstrations against the anti-Islam march were led by Respect MP George Galloway who spoke at the rally, branding the far-right protesters a 'German Nazi group' Organisers from Pegida insisted the rally would be entirely peaceful, but five people were arrested amid a heavy police presence in Newcastle's city centre. The five men, all from and the anti-Islam rally, were arrested on a range of including suspicion of assault, being drunk and disorderly and breaching the peace. Mr Galloway, MP for Bradford West, addressed the counter-protest: 'All right-thinking people in Britain condemn the idea of a German Nazi group coming to the north east of England trying to stir up trouble. 'The vast majority of British people respect that and the people who are on here on the counter-demonstration are representing millions. 'We have enough problems in Britain without Germans coming over here and causing more. We have problems in Britain without racism and Islamophobia being further stoked.' Mr Galloway, who travelled to the North East in his Mercedes, said he was not anti-German. 'I love Germans, I'm driving a German car, but this is one German import we don't want.' Police arrested five people following today's sporadic violent outbreaks. A 37-year-old man from Newcastle was arrested for assault, while two others, aged 43 and 54 were arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. The final two people arrested were a 17-year-old youth and a 20-year-old man from Halifax who were detained for breach of the peace. Paul Weston, leader of the obscure far-right Liberty GP political party, told followers at the rally that Muslims would soon 'take over' Britain. A far larger gounter demonstration took place in Newcastle today, pictured, with representatives from several trade unions .

Police separate the counter-demonstration from the far-right group, as thousands lined the streets to condemn the anti-Islam protest . Pegida leader Lutz Bachmann was pictured posing as Adolf Hitler . Pegida started in Dresden, in Germany, last October as far-right activists gathered weekly in the city to demonstrate against what they perceive as the Islamisation of Germany and Europe. The protests rapidly grew in size - from hundreds to around 25,000 - and spread into Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Spain, Belgium and now Britain. The group has sought to distance itself from the far-right, saying in its position paper posted on Facebook that it is against 'preachers of hate, regardless of what religion' and 'radicalism, regardless of whether religiously or politically motivated'. It has also banned any neo-Nazi symbols and slogans at its rallies, however it was mired in scandal when its leader Lutz Bachmann was pictured posing as Adolf Hitler. He was forced to stand down as the group's leader after a furious backlash to the photograph, which he insisted was a joke. Pegida's leaders have singled out Muslim immigrants in their speeches, but the movement has broadened into one against immigrants from all backgrounds. A particular target has been 'economic refugees', or asylum seekers who they say are seeking a better standard of living in Germany. Paul Weston, leader of the obscure far-right Liberty GP political party, told followers at the rally that Muslims would soon 'take over' Britain. 'That is exactly what they will do if we quietly do nothing,' he told the crowd. 'We have to fight back.' Pegida - whose German acronym means Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West - peaked last month in Dresden when 25,000 people attended a rally, but its popularity faded when one of its leaders was pictured posing as Hitler. A number of further protests in Germany were also cancelled following fears they were at risk of terrorist attacks. Dr Jacqui Rodgers, a university lecturer, was on the counter-demonstration which attracted a cross-section of people of different faiths. She said: 'I think it is really important for us to unite as a community and make it very clear to organisations that are trying to get a foothold in the UK that we will not tolerate their attitude and we won't accept their racist and fascist policies.'

This man raised his hand in a defiant gesture with his hooded top featuring an AR15 assault rifle covered in an American flag . But Pegida rally organiser Donna Trainor said: 'Islam is not a race, it is a religion. (The term) racist shouldn't be on the table. 'Pegida raises awareness. We want the Government to take notice and take Jihadis and Muslim extremists off the street.' Unemployed Wendy Ellison, 46, from Durham, took her bulldogs Willow and Betty to the Pegida rally. She said: 'It's no good sitting in the house, shouting at the telly. 'I feel our country is messed up now. It doesn't feel like Britain any more.'

"Popular Australian blogger Jessica Ainscough, the 'Wellness Warrior', has died of cancer at the age of 30 after seven years of sharing her battle with the disease. The 30-year-old passed away on Thursday, after a long battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma, which she chose to fight with natural and often controversial methods. When Ms Ainscough was diagnosed at the age of 22, she refused conventional treatment and her doctor's reccomendation that her arm be amputated, opting instead for a natural treatment called Gerson Therapy which involves drinking raw juices and coffee enemas. Scroll down for video . Popular Australian blogger Jessica Ainscough, the 'Wellness Warrior', has died of cancer at the age of 30 . 'I didn’t chop off my arm. I didn’t go into aggressive, full-body chemotherapy. I didn’t accept that my doctor’s ‘solution’ was the only course of action,' she wrote on her Wellness Warrior blog. 'I decided that I would do everything in my power to thrive in life, in spite of the looming expiration date I’d been given. I learned how to treat myself with absolute kindness & self-respect. I radicalised my diet. I systematically detoxified my body — and mind.' Ms Ainscough adopted a strict vegan diet, and additional suppliments to 'heal' her body without chemotherapy, an approach which has no scientific support but has garnered enthusiastic adoption from a small proportion of cancer sufferers around the world. Her cancer stopped spreading, and she reported that her 'flare-ups' were minimal, allowing her to live a relatively normal life. 'Somewhere along the way, I realised that I was more than a ‘cancer story’ — I was a leader, a role model, an educator, and a champion,' she wrote on her blog. 'Part of an empowering wellness revolution, sweeping the planet. Someone who could change lives & provide HOPE — simply by showing up, and telling my story.' Ms Ainscough detailed her journey with the method on her popular blog, attracting thousands of followers on social media and publishing a book called 'Make Peace with Your Plate'. Ms Ainscough's mother was diagnosed with cancer, and after embracing Gerson therapy, died in 2013 . Ms Ainscough detailed her journey with the method on her popular blog, 'The Wellness Warrior' When Ms Ainscough was diagnosed at the age of 22, she refused conventional treatment . Her unusual approach to fighting cancer attracted significant criticism from the public, and bodies such as the Cancer Council. 'The data that are available are not sufficient to warrant claims that the Gerson therapy is effective as an adjuvant to other cancer therapies or as a cure,' a page on the Cancer Council's website says. 'At this time, the use of the Gerson therapy in the treatment of cancer patients cannot be recommended outside the context of well-designed clinical trials.' Her mother was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by Ms Ainscough's success, also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. 'I’ve been challenged, frightened, and cracked open in ways I never had before. After my mum died at the end of last year, my heart was shattered and it’s still in a million pieces,' she wrote on her blog in December last year. 'I had no idea how to function without her, and it turns out my body didn’t either. For the first time in my almost seven year journey with cancer, this year I’ve been really unwell,' she wrote. 'I’ve been challenged, frightened, and cracked open in ways I never had before,' said Ms Ainscough on her blog . Ms Ainscough wrote in her last blog post that she expected to be writing again in January . 'I’ve lived with cancer since 2008 and for most of those years my condition was totally stable. When my mum became really ill, my cancer started to become aggressive again. After she died, things really started flaring up.' Ms Ainscough reportedly began pursuing conventional treatments after she suffered through ten months of constant bleeding from the tumours in her arm and shoulder. 'This has been a game-changer for me and also very strange. Some weeks I’ve felt nothing but overwhelming sadness, others I’ve been really bitter and angry,' she wrote. 'I’ve also spent my time doing lots of research into treatment options. I’ve been speaking to doctors, healers, and specialists and I’ve been completely opening myself up to attracting the right people who will help me heal – whether they are from the natural medicine world or conventional,' 'My beliefs have been completely shaken up and I’ve had to drop any remnants of fear and ego that were preventing me from exploring these options sooner.' Ms Ainscough wrote in her last blog post that she expected to be writing again in January. Her website now features a photograph of Ms Ainscough, with the memorium 'On February 26th, 2015, the world lost one of its brightest sparks'. 'After 30 years, seven of which were spent thriving with cancer, Jess Ainscough peacefully passed away.'

"Icy weather and multiple mechanical issues turned an American Airlines flight that was supposed to last for less than an hour into a nine-hour nightmare - before the plane even left the ground. American Airlines flight 382 was supposed to leave Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport at 1.45pm on Friday for Oklahoma City, but didn't take off until 10.48pm. The plane was originally grounded because it was being de-iced, a process that took five hours because of heavy snow. But just as the plane reached the end of the runway and passengers thought they were finally getting in the air, it was revealed there was a mechanical issue with the aircraft. Icy weather and multiple mechanical issues grounded American Airlines flight 382 in Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport for over nine hours. Passenger Brandon Sullivan tweeted from the scene and said the weather was slowing things down at the airport . Sullivan also tweeted a photograph of flight attendants taking care of a sick passenger and wrote that people were 'becoming ill' after being stuck in the plane for over seven hours . Passenger Ryan Eccles told Daily Mail Online the plane had problem after problem. 'It was frustrating due to just the number of things that were going wrong,' he said. 'We had to wait in line to de-ice, wait for take off clearance, then we had a pressure indicator issue and had to return to the gate, and wait for a gate.' 'Then our parking assist was broken, so then we had to wait for maintenance and start the whole process again.' Passenger Brandon Sullivan told ABC News the scene on the plane 'got a little chaotic' as people started raiding the liquor fridge and pulling out drinks. The plane had to be de-iced, a process that was delayed because of heavy snow, and then it was revealed the plane had a pressure indicator issue and a broken parking assist . Just as the plane reached the end of the runway and passengers thought they were finally getting in the air, it was revealed there was a mechanical issue with the aircraft . Eccles said the captain told the plane he had instructed the flight attendants to provide everyone with whatever they wanted to drink. Sullivan tweeted that tempers were 'raging' after nearly six hours on the plane, and that adults were 'kicking each other's seats and shouting' expletives. He also tweeted a photograph of flight attendants taking care of a sick passenger and wrote that people were 'becoming ill' after being stuck in the plane for over seven hours. Eccles said he also saw a couple of people feeling unwell, and that the crew was attentive and took good care of them. Despite the long hours and the snacks running out fast, Eccles said things went 'pretty well' and that after awhile he was actually having 'a pretty good time' with the passengers near him. He credits the flight attendants for making the ordeal a little smoother and said they even volunteered to extend their hours so that the plane could still fly. Passenger Sullivan described the frustration inside the aircraft. He also said the plane got a 'little chaotic' as people started raiding the liquor cabinet . After eight hours the attendants were up against their daily limit, but no replacement crew was available. Passengers were given two chances to leave the plane for good, and one chance to leave in order to get something to eat. A diabetic man was also given a second opportunity to leave the plane and pick up food. American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller apologized for the incident and said 'extreme weather impacting north Texas' had made for a 'challenging day' at the Dallas airport. 'The safety of our passengers and employees is always our top priority,' he said. According to the airline, the nine-hour delay did not violate the Department of Transportation's three-hour limit because the plane was not actually held on the tarmac. ABC News aviation consultant Stephen Ganyard said de-icing a plane is extremely important, because any ice on the wing could challenge it's ability to fly. But Ganyard noted that the weather had been bad 'for days' in Dallas. 'This was not a surprise to American,' he said. 'They should have been better prepared.","American Airlines Flight 382 was supposed to leave Dallas airport at 1.45pm for Oklahoma City .

"A driver had to be rescued after getting his car stuck in the mud - and then could only watch as the tide came in and swamped it. Stephen Cooper, 34, had driven his car along the beach at Weston Shore in Southampton, Hants, when it got stuck at 4.30pm yesterday. Mr Cooper, 34, from Eastleigh, Hants, was looking for a spot to fish when his 20-year-old Mitsubishi Pajero fell in a hole on the shingle beach. Submerged: The 4x4 sunk on the shingle beach before the tide came in and quickly swallowed the vehicle, causing extensive damage . Off road: Driver Stephen Cooper had been looking for a spot to fish when his Mitsubishi Pajero became stuck in a hole on a beach in Southampton and the tide came in . As the tide came in, he was taken to safety by Hill Head Coastguard and Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service but the car was left in the water. The self employed plasterer said around £1,500 worth of damage was done to the vehicle. People came from as far away from Portsmouth to help - once the tide went out at 10.30pm - six hours later, despite advice from the Coastguard. Stephen said: 'I'm angry and upset that it happened. 'I phoned up a guy I know who said he would come and help and then loads of other people said they were on their way. 'It's brilliant that everyone came to help.' To the rescue: Another 4x4 is used to tow the Mitsubishi out of the water after it became stuck on a Southampton beach and the tide came in . Five vehicles arrived at the shore to try to drag the car to safety but Solent Coastguard said only professional recovery teams should rescue a car from the water. A spokesman said: 'We would be concerned for the safety of any persons in or entering the water and we would urge anyone who sees a vehicle going into the water to dial 999 and ask for the coastguard. 'We would urge anyone thinking of attempting to recover their vehicle from the water to seek professional recovery and not attempt to enter the water.'","Driver went on the shingle beach looking for a fishing spot .

"The extraordinary extent of King Edward VIII’s flirtation with Hitler and the determined efforts by the post-war British establishment to bury the evidence has been uncovered in a new book by the biographer of Princess Diana. Author Andrew Morton says he spent years working through Nazi files to demonstrate Edward’s true sympathy with the Fuhrer - to the extent that Hitler planned to install Edward as a puppet king on the British throne. Fearing the files were ‘an unexploded bomb’ which could bring down the House of Windsor, prominent figures including King George VI, Winston Churchill and even Allied Supreme Commander Dwight Eisenhower had demanded that all evidence of Edward’s dealings with the Nazis be destroyed. Scroll down for video . A sensational new book claims that Adolf Hitler, right, wanted to install the Duke of Windsor, left, as a Nazi puppet if his forces were able to crush British resistance during World War II . The book claims that the Duke, center, was angered at being forced to abdicate the throne in 1936 because he wanted to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson, left, and was willing to work with Adolf Hitler, right . The Duke of Windsor, right, viewed Winston Churchill, left, as a war-monger and wanted peace with Germany . According to an extract of the Seventeen Carnations - The Windsors, The Nazis and the Cover-Up published in the print edition of The Mail on Sunday, his disloyalty knew no boundaries. Edward - or the Duke of Windsor as he became known after the abdication - thought his brother, the King, was ‘utterly stupid, that the Queen was an ‘intriguer’ and that Churchill was a ‘war monger’. Only the continued heavy bombing of British cities, he believed, would bring the country to the negotiating table with Germany. As to Hitler himself, the duke thought he was ‘a very great man’ and that it would be ‘a tragic thing for the world’ if the Fuhrer were overthrown. Morton says the crucial documents in what became known as the Windsor Files were originally contained on microfilm, hidden in a battered metal canister and buried in a remote German woodland. They were recovered by Allied soldiers, dubbed ‘the Documents Men’ days after the end of the fighting in 1945, and despite the best efforts of the British establishment, to suppress them, copies still survive. Morton, who also had access to previously unpublished letters and historical documents, reveals how deeply Edward had felt ostracised and humiliated in the wake of his abdication in 1936, and had become dangerously outspoken in his criticism of Churchill and the war effort. Military leaders had serious concerns about the Duke of Windsor, right,  and his wife Wallis Simpson, left . The couple, pictured, married at a private ceremony on June 3, 1937 in France and honeymooned in Germany . The Duke, pictured here making his abdication speech, believed Britain could be bombed to submission . Before his abdication, Edward had gone so far as to send Hitler a telegram wishing him ‘happiness and welfare’ for his 47th birthday, a month after the dictator occupied the Rhineland in March 1936. The duke spent his honeymoon in Austria before the war and visited Germany in October 1937 as Hitler’s honoured guest. When he accepted an invitation to take a 12-day visit to the Fatherland. in October 1937, he controversially gave a Nazi salute to Hitler and other leaders at Berchtesgaden, Fuhrer’s mountain retreat. Morton’s book reports that, encouraged by Edward’s unguarded private utterances, the Germans promised to protect his rented houses and their contents in Paris and Cannes, and hatched a sinister plot to entice the Duke and Duchess to stay in Spain while they invaded and conquered Britain. The Duke would return home as the Fuhrer’s puppet king. Before Edward’s abdication, Hitler had tried to marry him to a young German princess. When that failed, says the book, but he then flooded London with a slew of Nazi supporting aristocrats who were ordered to find out what their Royal cousins were thinking. Wallis Simpson, too, came under suspicion from the British authorities, says the author. It was thought she had conducted an affair with Nazi diplomat Ernst von Ribbentrop, who had sent her seventeen carnations daily, one for each night they had spent together - hence the title of the book. Some even suspected that Wallis was a Nazi spy. Despite concerns, the Duke of Windsor made trips to the War Office, pictured, during the conflict . By September 1939, Edward and Wallis had been packed off by the British government to France. Morton writes that there is strong circumstantial evidence that loose table talk from the Duke made its made its way from Paris back to Berlin and influenced Hitler’s military strategy. When the former king was ordered to move to Spain, Hitler is said to have offered the former royals a small fortune and a palace in Ronda, in southern Spain, if they would stay there for the duration of the war. Edward was so tempted by the offer he telegraphed Churchill to ask if there was any need for a prompt return to London. Churchill promptly ordered that he be moved to Portugal. Morton says the Nazis were so sympathetic to Edward, they regarded him as a virtual prisoner of the British secret services who longed to escape and join them. German diplomats believed the Duke was ‘the only Englishman with whom Hitler would negotiate any peace terms, the logical director of England’s destiny after the war.’ 17 Carnations by Andrew Morton is published by Michael O’Mara, priced £20.00.

"BBC political editor Nick Robinson is fighting a rare form of cancer, it emerged last night. The 51-year-old has been diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid tumour and will undergo lifesaving surgery to have it removed. Located in the lungs’ larger tubes, they are usually slow-growing. But they can spread and trigger cancer elsewhere in the body, becoming fatal. BBC political editor Nick Robinson has been diagnosed with a bronchial carcinoid tumour and will undergo lifesaving surgery to have it removed . In a statement, Mr Robinson’s agent said the broadcaster would be ‘taking a short time off work over the next few weeks’. ‘His doctors are aiming to get him back at work in plenty of time to cover the Election campaign proper,’ she added. ‘He and his family have asked that they now have the space and privacy he needs in order to rest and recover fully before returning to work.’ Prime Minister David Cameron sent Mr Robinson a message of goodwill, tweeting: ‘Sorry to hear you’ll be off for a few weeks. I wish you well – and a speedy return before the General Election.’ And a BBC spokesman said: ‘Everyone at the BBC wishes Nick a speedy recovery.’ Last night Mr Robinson tweeted: ‘Thank you for the many kind and generous messages. Here’s hoping to be back reporting the news soon.’ Bronchial carcinoid tumours are different from ‘normal’ lung cancer, which forms among the cells that line the lung. Carcinoid tumours are actually cancers of tissues that produce hormones and send messages, called the neuroendocrine system. Prime Minister David Cameron sent Mr Robinson a message of goodwill on Twitter and wishing him a speedy recovery . The Prime Minister tweeted: 'Sorry to hear you’ll be off for a few weeks. I wish you well – and a speedy return before the General Election’ They can occur in numerous organs. Two-thirds appear in the digestive tract, a quarter in the lungs, and others in the pancreas, kidney, ovary and testes, according to Cancer Research UK. Dr Keith Prowse, medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation, said while bronchial carcinoid tumours were malignant, they tended to be less aggressive than other forms. He said: ‘I’ve had ten or a dozen patients who have had it removed successfully and are still around, some of them older than I am. The majority are cured by surgery. ‘It’s often possible to remove the tumours completely, because they tend to grow inside the air passage rather than into the lung.’ About 70 per cent of patients live at least five years after being diagnosed, he added. But he said if they did spread, they tended to be fairly resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Most people with bronchial carcinoid tumours are diagnosed after the age of 60, although they can have existed for years without any symptoms. Mr Robinson has been the Corporation’s political editor since 2005, when he was poached from ITN. His illness follows that of his BBC predecessor, Andrew Marr, who suffered a stroke in January 2013 at the age of 53. After lengthy rehabilitation Mr Marr has made a good recovery.","Agent says Mr Robinson is suffering from bronchial carcinoid tumour .

"Two coastguard patrol boats blasted each other with water cannon as tensions escalated over the ownership of a tiny group of rocky islands in the South China Sea. The Japanese vessel opened fire on its Taiwanese rival as the ship encroached on the disputed land - which is also claimed by China - earlier today. In a bid to repel the approaching flotilla, they opened fire with their powerful water arsenal. But the Taiwanese boats fired back with their own spray guns sparking a ferocious water fight. Super soakers at dawn: The Japanese coastguard (top) exchanges fire with a Taiwanese counterpart (bottom) in a ferocious water fight . In the end, the might of Japan proved too strong for their Taiwanese counterparts, who eventually turned on their tails and headed home.

Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Chikao Kawai, flanked by their aides, held a meeting on the dispute on Tuesday at China's Foreign Ministry. While both governments appeared publicly to be seeking to calm tensions, gamesmanship around the islands continues. Diplomatic tensions: Around 40 Taiwanese fishing boats were joined by 12 Taiwanese government patrol boats in approaching the islands, and some of them violated Japanese territorial waters, Japanese coastguard officials said .

After water cannon were fired on both sides, the Taiwanese boats left Japanese waters, they said. Taiwan's government-owned Central News Agency said 75 Taiwanese fishing boats, escorted by coast guard ships, entered waters surrounding the islands to assert Taiwan's sovereignty over the disputed territory. Hard fought: China, Japan and Taiwan all claim the islands, but they are administered by Tokyo, since the Japanese government bought them from private owners two weeks ago . Relations between the two countries deteriorated sharply after Japan bought the islands, which are called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China . The arrival of Taiwan vessels in the . area could complicate the potentially fraught game of cat-and-mouse . being played near the islands, where mainland China has launched an . effort to assert sovereignty by sending government ships into the . disputed waters. China sent its first aircraft carrier into formal service today amid a tense maritime dispute with Japan, a show of naval force that could worry its neighbours. China's Ministry of Defence said the newly named Liaoning aircraft carrier would 'raise the overall operational strength of the Chinese navy' and help Beijing to 'effectively protect national sovereignty, security and development interests'. In fact, the aircraft carrier, refitted from a ship bought from Ukraine, will have a limited role, mostly for training and testing ahead of the possible launch of China's first domestically built carriers after 2015, analysts say. But China cast the formal handing over of the carrier to its navy as a triumphant show of national strength - at a time of bitter tensions with neighbouring Japan over islands claimed by both sides. 'China will never tolerate any bilateral actions by Japan that harm Chinese territorial sovereignty,' Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said on Tuesday. 'Japan must banish illusions, undertake searching reflection and use concrete actions to amend its errors, returning to the consensus and understandings reached between our two countries' leaders.' Chinese boats have also briefly . entered the waters around the islands, but Japanese coast guard vessels . didn't fire water cannon at them. A . coast guard official said Chinese vessels usually exit the Japanese . waters more quickly after verbal warnings, without forcing Japanese . patrol ships to take physical action. The . Taiwan fishing group said their boats would sail around the islands to . reassert their right to fish there and did not rule out trying to land . on the rocky isles. Taiwan Defence Minister Kao Hua-chu told parliament that the military was ready for any contingency, but did not elaborate. Taiwan . has traditionally had friendly ties with Japan, but the two countries . have long squabbled over fishing rights in the area. Beijing deems . Taiwan to be an illegitimate breakaway province, and the two sides both . argue they have inherited China's historic sovereignty over the islands, . which are near rich fishing grounds and potentially huge oil and gas . reserves.

"A Massachusetts woman is tackling the overwhelming amount of snow in her town by shoveling sidewalks to make them accessible for all  -- and she's doing it all from her wheelchair. Crystal Evans, 33, of Braintree suffers from a neuromuscular disease, but that hasn't stopped her from starting a business or a family, and it isn't stopping her from getting around Braintree, a city just 10 miles from Boston, which has seen more than 100 inches of snow this winter. Evans, a mother who runs a business from home making party supplies, told the Patriot Ledger that she was stuck in her home for three weeks because of the snow and couldn't get to the post office to mail packages to her customers. So, she took matters into her own hands. Tackling The Snow: Crystal Evans, 33, is tackling Massachusett's overwhelming amount of snow by shoveling sidewalks, making them accessible for all in her town -- and she's doing it all from her wheelchair . Can't Be Stopped: Evans, 33, of Braintree suffers from a neuromuscular disease, but that hasn't stopped her from starting a business or a family, and it isn't stopping her from getting around Braintree . 'I realized I could put the shovel between my wheelchair and footrest and just go with it, and it plows it,' she said. 'I'm working to keep the sidewalks successful all winter.' Since January, Evans has spent more than 100 hours shoveling, making Braintree's sidewalks passable with piles of snow as high as her head, AOL reports. However, Evans' efforts aren't just about her. She said there are mothers carrying infants on the icy sidewalks and elderly citizens who live in the area. The Ledger reports that Evans often spends five hours in one day shoveling and even comes out during snowstorms to break down icy paths. Braintree is expected to get three to six inches of snow through Monday, according to AccuWeather. She puts up signs once a sidewalk is clear letting everyone know the path is now an 'accessible shoveled sidewalk.' Her efforts have not gone unnoticed, her actions have inspired others to help out. Evans said people who drive by and see her working stop to help and once, one man even went and got a snow blower. Hours: Since January, Evans has spent more than 100 hours shoveling making Braintree's sidewalks passable with piles of snow as high as her head . Evans said she has supplied shovels for the many volunteers who have stopped to help her and she has reached out for more volunteers on several of Braintree's Facebook pages. 'Some help for a couple minutes; one kid came for three hours. We got a lot done,' she told the Ledger. Evans is part of a movement to change the nation's handicap symbol from a person in a wheelchair to someone in action, boldly taking charge, according to AOL. 'There is so much stigma of what people believe a disabled person is, they don't expect us to be working. They don't expect us to be out in the community,' Evans said. In a letter to the Ledger, Evans wrote that, in the face of excessive snowfall in the area, she hopes people choose to 'stop complaining and take to their shovels.' 'Ensuring accessibility to our cities and towns is our responsibility,' she said.

An Uber spokesman told the New York Post that the company waited so long -- more than five months -- to disclose the hack because an investigation was being conducted. The spokesman declined to elaborate. A cybersecurity expert for risk consulting firm Kroll told the Los Angeles Times that having access to a driver's name and license number may not be enough for identity theft, but if used along with other personal information -- like a birth date or credit card number -- it could pose a threat.

"Actors from privileged backgrounds dominate film and television, the chair of BAFTA Anne Morrison (above) has claimed . Actors from privileged backgrounds dominate film and television, the chair of BAFTA has claimed. Anne Morrison said more should be done to ensure underprivileged actors can crack the industry. Ms Morrison, the second woman to take the chair post, is particularly concerned that films will start to reflect just one demographic, as 'supremely talented' students from poorer backgrounds are missing out. Speaking to the Evening Standard, she said: 'We want a truly diverse industry, we want to hear stories from everybody. 'We should celebrate all people who succeed, privileged or not, but we do need to intervene and help those whose talents would otherwise be lost to us.' The spat over whether the arts world is dominated by privileged people started after a Labour MP criticised the number of posh actors and musicians in Britain. Chris Bryant, shadow minister for the arts, referred specifically to boarding school stars such as singer James Blunt and Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne in his rant. Mr Bryant, who attended the £20,000-a-year Cheltenham College, said that 'their ilk' were creating a 'cultural drought'. The remarks sparked a furious response from Harrow-educated Blunt, who retorted by calling Mr Bryant a 'prejudiced wazzock' and blamed him for using the 'politics of jealousy' to win votes. In a letter to the MP, the You're Beautiful singer said: 'I happened to go to a boarding school. No one helped me at boarding school to get into the music business. 'I bought my first guitar with money I saved from holiday jobs (sandwich packing!).' The spat over whether the arts world is dominated by privileged people started after a Labour MP criticised the number of posh actors and musicians in Britain, including Eddie Redmayne (above with his Oscar trophy) Chris Bryant (left), shadow minister for the arts, caused a furious response from Harrow-educated singer James Blunt (right), who called the Labour MP a 'prejudiced wazzock' But Mr Bryant hit back at the pop star's online attack and criticised him further for being 'so blooming precious'. Other actors have since weighed in on the row. Benedict Cumberbatch raised eyebrows when he said that he was considering moving to the US because he was fed up with being 'castigated' for his public school background. And Laurence Fox, who also attended Harrow, came out in support of Blunt and said: ‘It’s a relief to come out. I’m a posh British man. And proud.’ But Julie Walters, who was awarded a full grant to study at Manchester Polytechnic, said that working-class children were not represented in the industry. 'It's really sad. I think it means that we're going to get loads more middle-class drama,' she told the Guardian Weekend magazine at the end of January. The You're Beautiful singer reignited the row with Mr Bryant less than a week later on Twitter and told the MP to give people 'a ladder, not a bow and arrow' Dame Judi Dench (left) and Julie Walters (right) have also weighed in on the debate, both supporting the idea that not enough is done to get working class actors into the industry . Dame Judi Dench similarly claimed last year that acting had become elitist, citing that young people could not afford to attend drama school or go to the theatre anymore. The Oscar-award winning star, who attended the private Mount School in York where fees cost £8,700 a year, blamed financial barriers to training for the problem. Ms Morrison's comments come just a week after the Oscars and at the same time BAFTA launched its annual scholarship scheme. The scheme is described on the BAFTA website as 'scholarships to UK students in need of financial assistance to take a post-graduate course related to a career in film, television or games'. Students will be awarded £10,000 so they can take up a course and will also be given a personal mentor and access to BAFTA events throughout the year.","Anne Morrison said more needs to be done to help underprivileged actors .

"Pope Francis today launched a scathing attack on economic injustice and the 'throwaway culture' of globalisation . Pope Francis has launched a fresh attack on economic injustice, condemning the 'throwaway culture' of globalisation and calling for new ways of thinking about poverty, welfare, employment and society. In a speech to the association of Italian cooperative movements, he pointed to the 'dizzying rise in unemployment' and the problems that existing welfare systems had in meeting healthcare needs. For those living 'at the existential margins' the current social and political system 'seems fatally destined to suffocate hope and increase risks and threats,' he said. The Argentinian-born pope, who has often criticised orthodox market economics for fostering unfairness and inequality, said people were forced to work long hours, sometimes in the black economy, for a few hundred euros a month because they were seen as easily replaceable. ''You don't like it? Go home then. What can you do in a world that works like this? Because there's a queue of people looking for work. If you don't like it, someone else will,' he said in an unscripted change from the text of his speech. 'It's hunger, hunger that makes us accept what they give us,' he said. His remarks have special resonance in Italy, where unemployment, particularly among young people, is running at record levels after years of economic recession. The cooperative movement in Italy, whose roots go back to 19th century workers' associations, have long had close ties to the Catholic Church, with credit services, agricultural and building co-ops forming an important part of the overall economy. Pope Francis said they could help find new models and methods that could be an alternative model to the 'throw-away culture created by the powers that control the economic and financial policies of the globalised world.' Perhaps mindful of a wide-ranging corruption scandal linked to some cooperatives in Rome last year, he attacked those who 'prostitute the cooperative name'. Pope Francis meets a woman and young girl during today's meeting with the association of Italian cooperative movements . Pope Francis' remarks had particular resonance in Italy, which is suffering from high levels of unemployment . Pope Francis receives a present from a well-wisher at today's meeting at the Vatican . But his overall message was that economic rationale had to be secondary to the wider needs of human society. 'When money becomes an idol, it commands the choices of man. And thus it ruins man and condemns him. It makes him a slave,' he said. 'Money at the service of life can be managed in the right way by cooperatives, on condition that it is a real cooperative where capital does not have command over men but men over capital,' he said.","Pope Francis launches scathing attack on 'throwaway' economic culture .

"On the outside, the metal box looks like an oversized bread container. But what's inside could save an abandoned newborn's life. The box is actually a newborn incubator, or baby box, and it could be showing up soon at Indiana hospitals, fire stations, churches and selected nonprofits under legislation that would give mothers in crisis a way to surrender their children safely and anonymously. Indiana could be the first state to allow use of the baby boxes on a broad scale to prevent dangerous abandonments of infants if the bill, which unanimously passed the House this week, clears the state Senate. Republican state Rep. Casey Cox and child-safety advocates say they're unaware of any other states that have considered the issue at the level Indiana has. Safe haven: Monica Kelsey, firefighter and medic who is president of Safe Haven Baby Boxes Inc poses with a prototype of a baby box,  where parents could surrender their newborns anonymously . Cox says his bill is a natural progression of the 'safe haven' laws that exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Those give parents a legal way to surrender newborns at hospitals, police stations and other facilities without fear of prosecution so long as the child hasn't been harmed. Many children, however, never make it that far. Dawn Geras, president of the Save the Abandoned Babies Foundation in Chicago, said safe haven laws have resulted in more than 2,800 safe surrenders since 1999. But more than 1,400 other children have been found illegally abandoned, nearly two-thirds of whom died. Cox said his proposal draws on a centuries-old concept to help 'those children that are left in the woods, those children that are abandoned in dangerous places.' Baby boxes, known in some countries as baby hatches or angel cradles, originated in medieval times, when convents were equipped with revolving doors known as 'foundling wheels.' Choice: Parents can leave children at Indiana fire stations where they will be safely placed with new homes . Unwanted infants were placed in compartments in the doors, which were then rotated to get the infant inside. Hundreds of children have been surrendered in modern-day versions in place in Europe and Asia. The devices are even the subject of a new documentary titled 'The Drop Box,' which chronicles the efforts of a pastor in Seoul, South Korea, to address child abandonment. Supporters contend the boxes can save lives by offering women who can't face relinquishing a child in person a safe and anonymous alternative to abandonment or infanticide. But critics say the boxes make it easier to abandon a child without exploring other options and contend they do nothing to address poverty and other societal issues that contribute to unwanted babies. Expect them soon: These boxes could be showing up at hospitals, fire stations, churches and other selected sites under legislation that would give mothers in crisis a way to surrender their children safely . Some baby hatches in China have been so overwhelmed by abandonments in recent years that local officials have restricted their use or closed them. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for a ban on the boxes in Europe and has urged countries to provide family planning and other support to address the root causes of abandonments, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Throssell. Whether the U.S. is ready for the boxes is a matter of debate. Geras said many parents who surrender their children at safe haven sites need medical care that they won't get if they leave the baby in a box. Handing the child to a trained professional also provides an opportunity to determine whether the mother simply needs financial support or other help to develop a parenting plan. 'If you use a baby box, you have stripped away that option,' Geras said. Don't abandon baby: Mothers should not abandon their newborns dangerously  and can instead leave them in a baby box where they will be safe . 'There's a lot of things that need to be done to improve safe haven laws throughout the country, but that's not one of them.' A better approach, she said, is for states to spend more money to promote their existing laws. Monica Kelsey, a Woodburn, Indiana, firefighter and medic who is president of Safe Haven Baby Boxes Inc., said the boxes aren't meant to circumvent the laws that already exist. Instead, they're part of a broader approach that includes increasing awareness about the laws and other options available to new mothers in crisis. 'If these boxes are the answer, great,' she said. 'We're trying to come at it from all angles.' Kelsey, who was abandoned in a hospital shortly after her birth because her mother's pregnancy was the result of rape, suggested the boxes to Cox and has formed a nonprofit that is working with a Fort Wayne, Indiana, company to develop a prototype. Holes to breath: The boxes are safe for children and have holes so that they can breathe properly . It would be about 2 feet long and be equipped with heating or cooling pads and sensors that would set off alarms when the box is opened and again when a weight is detected inside. The boxes also would include a silent alarm that mothers could activate themselves by pushing a button. 'We're giving her the power to do what's right,' Kelsey said. 'We're hoping that these girls know that once they push that button, their baby will be saved.' She stressed that the boxes should be viewed as a 'last resort' and would include a toll-free number staffed 24 hours a day by a counselor who would first ask the caller to surrender the baby to a person. The state health department would regulate the boxes. Cox's bill, which covers children up to 31 days old, also would create a public registry listing box locations. Kelsey said the bill expands safe haven locations to include churches and established nonprofits that deal with child-welfare issues to ensure that everyone has access. 'We want these locations to be able to accept a child if somebody ... thinks this is the only thing they can do,' she said.","On the outside, the metal box looks like an oversized bread container but what's inside could save an abandoned newborn's life .

"A mother-of-five has told of her horror and humiliation after a fellow diner in a McDonald's restaurant hurled insults at her and her disabled son for making too much noise. Melodie Daly was in the middle of moving houses when she decided to have an early dinner with her five children - including five-year-old Rylee who has severe autism, dyspraxia and sensory processing disorder. Rylee is non-verbal and makes noises to express himself. Wednesday afternoon was no exception. The 28-year-old mother says she was shocked when a middle-aged woman approached her in the diner at Cobram, north of Melbourne, to complain about her disabled son. 'You need to leave... the noise is too loud. This is a noise complaint,' the woman told Ms Daly. What then ensued left the mother-of-five disgusted. Ms Daly told Daily Mail Australia that the woman then proceeded to call Rylee: 'a spastic' and a 'f****** c***'. Scroll down for video . A mother-of-five is appealing for witnesses after her disabled son (pictured) became a victim to vile taunts by a McDonald's customer near Melbourne . Melodie Daly (pictured) was in the middle of moving houses when she decided to have an early dinner with her five children, including five-year-old Rylee . The 28-year-old mother says she was shocked when a middle-aged woman approached her to complain about her disabled son (pictured together) It had already been a stressful day for Ms Daly, having to move houses with five children. But that day had particularly been a good one for Rylee. 'I'm not sure if you've seen meltdowns by autistic children but that day Rylee was happy,' Ms Daly said. 'He was in a good mood that day because he was quite animated by a toy. 'So he can't help making the noises that he makes. He is non-verbal. He doesn't know he's making those kind of noises.' Ms Daly says she was at McDonald's at 4.50pm with her children for an early dinner. 'Then this family walked in with a little boy who was covering his ears because of the noise Rylee was making,' Ms Daly said. 'I really didn't think Rylee was being that loud so I saw no reason for this but I just let it go.' That's when Ms Daly says a woman, described as being in her 50s, came over to her table and said: 'You need to leave... the noise is too loud. This is a noise complaint.' Embarrassed by the confrontation, Ms Daly said she explained to the woman that her son was autistic. 'She then just turned around and walked back to her table with the little boy and another younger woman, to which she started to call Rylee some really horrible thing.' According to Ms Daly, the woman called Rylee a 'spastic' and a 'f****** c***' but had her back turned to Ms Daly and her family. 'It was obvious that she was saying it about Rylee,' Ms Daly said. She then recalled the woman say: 'I can't believe you would bring him out in public'. Ms Daly is hoping that her online appeal will help identify the woman .

Rylee (second left) with his siblings (from left) Lily, 7, Violet, 18 months, Calen, 8, and Noah, 4 . This prompted Ms Daly to put her kids back in the car and asked to speak with the manager at the fast food outlet's drive-thru. 'As I was talking to him the woman came out and walked past us with a smile and waved,' Ms Daly said. 'It was as if she knew exactly what she had done but just had no remorse. 'But my son, being the beautiful boy he is, smiled and waved back at her. That's when she and the other younger woman who was with her started laughing called him a ""f****** spastic"".' After reporting the incident to police, the distraught mother-of-five took to Facebook just hours after the incident with hopes that any witnesses may be able to help identify the woman at McDonald's. Ms Daly says she won't be silenced by those who bully her and her son . Ms Daly's children (from left) Noah, Violet, Rylee and Lily . 'I am going to stand up and fight for my son because I know nobody else will do it,' Ms Daly said . 'This kind of behaviour is just disgusting - I can't even begin to say how angry and upset it made me feel,' Ms Daly told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just wouldn't treat another person like that. 'I want this woman to feel ashamed for what she has done and that it's not okay to do this.' However Ms Daly says this isn't the first incident of its kind, as she is constantly given judgmental looks when she takes Rylee or her other eldest son Calen - who is also autistic - out in public places. 'Sometimes I just want to walk around in a shirt saying ""I have a son with special needs"" because of the kind of looks and snide comments I get when I'm out with my kids,' Ms Daly said. 'I would just like people to be more considerate and more aware that although some children may look normal they might have special needs. 'And you know, we are just as welcome to such public places like anybody else.' So in an attempt to stand up for her five-year-old son, Ms Daly says she won't be silenced by those who bully her and her son. 'He can't say how he feels so I have to be his voice because it's never okay to be treated like this,' she said. 'I am going to stand up and fight for my son because I know nobody else will do it.'","Melodie Daly was at McDonald's near Melbourne on Wednesday afternoon .

"A Muslim teacher once jailed by . Canada as a security threat has been accused of radicalizing four teenage students who have allegedly fled to Syria to fight with the Islamic State. Four men and two women, aged 18 and 19, left Montreal in January and February for Turkey and then on to Syria, according to media reports. Adil Charkaoui teaches Arabic and the Quran at two Montreal community colleges, where the teenagers studied before they went missing. Suspending his classes, both schools have accused Moroccan-born Charkaoui of spreading radical Muslim ideals. Charkaoui, an anti-Islamophobia advocate, denied the allegations on Friday, insisting he only had brief contact with one of the six students. Accused: Arabic teacher Adil Charkaoui has been suspended by two colleges after six students fled to Syria . He denies allegations he radicalized the 18- and 19-year-olds as he says he only briefly met one of them once . He told a press conference on Friday that anti-Muslim prejudice in Quebec is to blame for alienating Muslim students, not his classes, where he said only Arabic, the Koran and 'basic notions' are taught. Charkaoui was granted Canadian citizenship in July 2014, 11 years after he was arrested and accused of training with Al Qaeda. After being detained, he was monitored for six years before Canada dropped the case against him. The students are the latest in a string of . young Westerners who have become radicalized and have headed to . the Middle East hoping to fight with Islamic State. Charkaoui said only one of the departed students took a course at . his school, which rented classroom space from two colleges in . the Montreal area.

'I'm stunned by the twisted logic of the spokespersons of . the two (colleges) and the pseudo-experts that are blaming . radicalization of young people for what has happened,' he added, . noting that his school does not support Islamic State. Classes proceeded as usual on Friday at the College de . Maisonneuve, a 5,000-student pre-university and technical . college in Montreal where three of the teenagers studied. 'I didn't see anything strange with them. They prayed like . everyone else,' said student Marwa Durouoch, 18, who said she . knew the three teenagers. But Durouoch, who wears a head scarf, also expressed deep . feelings of frustration with what she perceives as a lack of . religious freedom for Muslims in Quebec. 'We're in a prison here. We're not allowed to practice our . religion ... They're in the process of copying France,' she . said, noting that she and many fellow students want to leave the . French-speaking province. Her frustration echoed that of one of the departed students, . Shayma Senouci, who in 2013 called on Facebook friends to sign a . petition against Quebec's 'Charter of Values', proposed . legislation that had sought to prohibit public-sector employees . from wearing or displaying conspicuous religious symbols, . including Muslim headscarves. The legislation died when the nationalist Parti Quebecois, . which spearheaded the Charter, lost power in last year's . provincial election, but tensions between Muslims and . non-Muslims in Quebec remain. Senouci's Facebook account included a video of a Muslim . woman being harassed on a Montreal bus with a one-word comment: .

"A rare friendship has blossomed between a convicted murdered who is the only female on death row in Georgia and a retired theologian in Germany. Kelly Renee Gissendaner is awaiting execution by lethal injection at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson for the 1997 murder of her husband in suburban Atlanta. Gissendaner masterminded a plan to stab her husband to death with her boyfriend so she could be with her lover and collect her spouse's life insurance. The 47-year-old will be the first woman to be put to death in Georgia since Lena Baker, an African-American maid convicted by an all-white jury of shooting her employer after he threatened her in 1945. Pen pals: Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 47, a convicted murderer sentenced to be executed by lethal injection, has been corresponding with German-based theologian Professor Jürgen Moltmann for years . However Gissendaner, who admits to her brutal crime, has reportedly turned over a new leaf in prison. After being sentenced to death in 1998, she enrolled in a theology studies program for prisoners, The New York Times reported. During her studies, Gissendaner became particularly enamored with Christian literary luminary Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was imprisoned and killed by the Nazis. Gissendaner also enjoyed the work of Professor Jürgen Moltmann, a German theologian 'whose books on hope, suffering and liberation have helped define postwar Protestant thought', The Times writes. Gissendaner was shocked to learn that her own teacher knew Professor Moltmann, and asked if she could reach out to him. With the teacher's blessing, Gissendaner sent Professor Moltmann a paper she had written on Bonhoeffer. Again to her shock, he replied. The two have since become pen pals and have exchanged around 30 letters. Moltmann spoke to The Times from his home in Germany, and said he enjoys discussing 'theological and fath' issues with Gissendaner. 'And I have found her very sensitive, and not a monster, as the newspapers depicted her,' he told the newspaper. 'And very intelligent. She has been rehabilitated. She has changed her mind, and her life.' In October 2011 the two were actually able to meet, after Professor Moltmann was booked to give a lecture in Atlanta and took it upon himself to visit Gissendaner. They had a supervised visit and discussed all the things they would have normally put in their letters, mostly about faith. Gissendaner began her studies at Metro State Prison, near Atlanta. However the program closed, and she was forced to do the course in her cell. A teacher visited her one-on-one for two hours, every Friday, for six months. Gissendander's requests for clemency were recently rejected - her final appeal. A chaplain who met Gissendaner when she first arrived in prison named Susan Bishop wrote a testimony for the clemency that said: . 'Professor Moltmann, who has been vocal of his own remorse at having fought in the German Army, offered his own of what could happen to Gissendaner after this point. 'If the State of Georgia has no mercy, she has received already the mercy of Heaven,' Moltmann told The Times. However Gissendaner was still found guilty of a heinous crime. At trial, the court heard details of how she spent months planning to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, with whom she shared a volatile relationship. According to CNN, the two divorced in 1993, only to remarry in 1995. On February 7, 1997, she dropped the man she had secretly been having a relationship with, Gregory Owen at her home, giving him a baton and a hunting knife. She then went out dancing with friends. Douglass Gissendaner was out with friends as well, so Owen waited inside the house. Murderous partners: Gissendaner (left in her 1997 arrest photo) arrived at the woods while her boyfriend Gregory Owen (right) was killing her husband and helped set his car on fire to destroy any forensic evidence . When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11pm, Owen forced him at knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. Owen beat the man with the baton in the woods and stabbed him in the neck eight to 10 times. He stole his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery. Gissendaner arrived at the scene as the murder took place but stayed in the car, the court was told. She did get out however to make sure her husband was dead. Gissendaner and Owen used kerosene she had brought with her to set fire to the car, and the two left together in Gissendaner's car. Murdered: Douglas Gissendaner and stabbed and beaten to death in woods outside Atlanta. Police found his decomposed body two weeks later . Police found the victim's car the next day but failed to find the body, and Gissendaner went on television to appeal for information concerning her husband's disappearance. Police eventually found the body, and Gissendaner and Owen were brought in for question. Their stories soon started to fall apart and Owen eventually confessed to the crime. He then struck a deal with police to testify against his lover and is now serving life in prison. When Gissendaner learned of the plea deal, she started writing letters from prison to bribe someone into confessing they took her to the crime scene at gunpoint. Gissendaner asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone who would make the confession for $10,000, however McDuffie subsequently turned Gissendaner in. The prosecution painted her as a monster who wanted to kill her husband for money. After 25 years in prison, Gissendaner was due to be executed this week, but it was postponed. A decision about her new execution date will be made Monday. Gissendaner has already chosen her last meal -  cornbread, two Burger King Whoppers with cheese, two large portions of chips, cherry vanilla ice-cream, popcorn, and lemonade.","Kelly Gissendaner, 47, sentenced to death for plotting her husband's 1997 murder with her boyfriend, Gregory Owen .

"Devastated: Mick Jagger claimed to have suffered a stress disorder after the death of his partner L'Wren Scott (pictured together) One of Britain’s most senior doctors has hit out at colleagues who diagnose rape victims and ex-servicemen with post-traumatic stress disorder at the ‘drop of a hat’. Professor Dinesh Bhugra, a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, suggests the condition is not a true mental illness but instead is being diagnosed as a result of the influence of ‘insurance firms and drug manufacturers’. He claims labelling patients with the term could delay recovery and worsen the problems. Famous sufferers are said to include singer Barbra Streisand, who developed symptoms including panic attacks and social anxiety after forgetting the words to one of her songs while performing in New York in the 1960s. More recently, Rolling Stone star Mick Jagger was claimed to have suffered a ‘traumatic stress disorder’ as a result of the suicide of his partner L’Wren Scott, leading to him postponing several tour dates. PTSD comprises a number of psychological symptoms resulting from a distressing, life-threatening event. They must occur for more than one month and include anxiety, insomnia, flashbacks, nightmares, sudden angry or irrational outbursts, an ability to remember parts of the traumatic event, and an avoidance of anything that reminds the sufferer of what happened. The term was coined in 1978 by the Vietnam Veterans Working Group, and is a more modern version of what was dubbed shell shock after the First World War. The new label is included in the latest edition the Diagnostic And Statistical Manual, published by the American Psychiatric Association – the most influential and widely used reference tool in psychiatry. Rather than being a cohesive, well-defined and meaningful condition such as depression, Prof Bhugra says that PTSD is merely a ‘cultural construct that is a reflection of the American healthcare system, which is dictated by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies’. He adds: ‘In America, which gave birth both to the term PTSD and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, psychiatrists cannot be paid unless there is a diagnosis in the book, leading to a tendency to medicalise every condition.’ The vast array of triggers and degrees of severity are what has led Prof Bhugra – current president of the World Psychiatric Association – to doubt the diagnosis. ‘The term PTSD is being over-used. It is being applied loosely, and doctors are diagnosing it much more readily than they should – at the drop of a hat. People assume now that if you have a traumatic event you will get PTSD. People are looking for it. I think it is quite possible that giving a diagnosis like that would hinder recovery. Professor Dinesh Bhugra (pictured) suggests condition is not a true mental illness and believes it is being diagnosed due to the influence of ‘insurance firms and drug manufacturers’ ‘It may send the clinician in the wrong direction because it might be clinical depression or anxiety. The patient then gets given the wrong treatments, like psychotherapy, rather than antidepressants.’ Many argue that talking treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) help speed up recovery from PTSD. But Prof Bhugra, awarded a CBE in 2012 for services to psychiatry, is unconvinced. ‘Is CBT working because it’s tackling underlying depression? Or because it is the appropriate treatment for PTSD? We don’t know,’ he says. ‘Inevitably if you give people a label they behave according to the label. Receiving this diagnosis can reaffirm for the patient the idea that he or she remains traumatised and may therefore struggle to believe they will recover, which could become self-fulfilling.’ Prof Bhugra says he has never given a patient a diagnosis of PTSD, but does accept the distress and the existence of mental-health problems following trauma. ‘There’s no doubt some people become anxious and experience some of the symptoms described after a traumatic event, but PTSD is a ragbag of experiences, and the only symptom not otherwise described or included in other psychiatric diagnoses is flashbacks,’ he adds. The condition is most commonly associated with soldiers returning from conflict, but it has also been linked with victims of violent crime and even women who have extremely painful experiences while giving birth. Dr Walter Busuttil, director of medical services at Combat Stress, the organisation devoted to the mental health of returning troops, said: ‘As a diagnostic category, PTSD is useful as it determines the evidence-based treatment the patient will receive. These may not be delivered otherwise. However, labelling an individual with PTSD when it is not present can harm the patient. ‘At Combat Stress we are currently supporting more than 5,600 veterans seeking our help – of these three-quarters have a primary diagnosis of PTSD. Most have been exposed to multiple military-related psychological traumas, mainly involving combat. The diagnosis of PTSD at Combat Stress is made by a senior psychiatrist and psychologist using clinical assessment, as well as psychometric measurement. ‘Treatments are geared towards trauma-focused therapies, which are evidence-based and can reduce or altogether stop symptoms of PTSD and improve function.’","Professor Dinesh Bhugra suggests condition is not a true mental illness .

"More than a dozen and a half stolen Italian artifacts, some of them more than 2,000 years old, have been seized by federal investigators and returned to their place of origin. The treasure trove included three frescoes dating back to 63-79AD and a dog statute from 4th century BC that were recovered from the Del Mar mansion of Madeleine Pickens, the ex-wife of oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens. The priceless artworks reportedly had been in the possession of Madeleine Pickens’ previous husband, billionaire Allen Paulson. Precious loot: Three Roman frescos and a dog-figure askos recovered from a private art collection in Del Mar are among 19 cultural treasures that are being returned to the Italian government this week . Cultural treasures: The cache of looted rare goods includes fifth century Greek pottery and items dating back to 300 to 460 BC . Pricelsss: The frescoes and the canine figurine once belonged to a Roman senator living near Pompeii some 500 years before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD . Officials with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations said Pickens did not know anything about the provenance of ancient artifacts, which were discovered under a blanket in the garage of the San Diego-area home in July 2012. The frescoes and the canine figurine once belonged to a Roman senator living near Pompeii before the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD, reported KGTV. The artworks were excavated in the early 1900s and were then stolen from a secure warehouse located near Naples in 1997. Allen Paulson, an aviation businessman, died from cancer in 2000 at age 78, about two years after the artworks were stolen. All 19 artifacts recovered by ICE were pilfered from Italy over the last several years, brought illegally into the US and then sold to different collectors. Power couple: The trio of frescoes and the dog figurine were seized in 2012 from the Del Mar, California, home of Madeleine Pickens (right), the former wife of oil magnate T. Boone Pickens (left) The items had been purchased by Pickens' previous husband, the late billionaire businessman Allen Paulson (left), and the woman said she knew nothing about the provenance of the artifacts . Madeleine Pickens, who divorced her oil magnate husband in 2012, willingly surrendered the looted artworks, which are now on their way back to Italy along with a 17th century cannon, 5th century Greek pottery and several antique books. ‘The cultural and symbolic worth of these Italian treasures far surpasses any monetary value to the Italians,’ said Anthony Scandiffio, deputy special agent in charge of HSI New York. ‘HSI remains a committed partner in the effort to ensure that we investigate individuals involved in the illicit trade and objects like these are returned to their rightful owner.’ HSI agents in New York on Wednesday seized six valuable objects, include an ancient Roman marble sarcophagus lid of Sleeping Ariadne nicknamed 'sleeping beauty.' 'Sleeping beauty': ICE agents have seized in New York this ancient Roman marble sarcophagus lid of Sleeping Ariadne . This 17th century cannon was among the 19 artifacts that were stolen from Italy in the past several years . The lid was identified as part of a collection of suspected looted Italian antiquities belonging to a known trafficker who was involved in trafficking archeological items from clandestine excavation sites in Italy. Agents in the San Francisco Bay Area also recovered a pair of stolen Italian books written in Latin dating to the 17th century. The books, 'Stirpium Historiae' and 'Rariorm Plantarum Historia Anno 1601,' were taken from Italy's Historical National Library of Agriculture and sold to an antiquities dealer in Italy, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement. The Bay Area buyer willingly surrendered the books to investigators. Eleven investigations nationwide led to the recovery of the antiquities. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Rome's force for combating art and antiquities crimes helped Homeland Security Investigations officials in New York, Boston, Baltimore, Miami, San Diego and San Francisco.

"Magma and lava from a volcanic eruption in the remote Pacific have formed a new island measuring one square mile in size. Photographs taken of the island of Nishinoshima, since an eruption off its coast in November 20, 2013, reveal the landmass is continuing to increase in size in an extremely rare volcanic phenomenon. The eruption off the coast of Nishinoshima island - which is located within the Ring of Fire - initially created an islet but the volcanic discharge has now merged with it to form a single landmass. Scroll down for video . Before: The island of Nishinoshima (top left) pictured during the underwater eruption off its coast . After: The two pieces of land pictured today after magma and lava from the eruption eventually cooled and connected the two to form a single landmass . Pictures of the site taken by the Japanese Coastguard show how the two islands have slowly formed into a single landmass over the past 15 months. Initially, scientists were unsure how long it would last because volcanic islets of that type tend to be reclaimed by the sea after a short time. The coastguard said the island is now 52 times bigger than the Tokyo Dome and is expected to continue growing, CNN reported. Early images also revealed remarkable discoloration of the water, caused by volcanic minerals and white puffs of steam and gases. Although the area regularly experiences earthquakes and eruptions, they are rarely as powerful as the latest one. This picture, taken on December 25, 2013, shows the new islet in its early formative stages . After erupting for a month, it had formed an islet that just touched neighbouring Nishinoshima . The underwater eruption began (pictured left and right) on November 20, 2013, and has continued ever since . In fact, the forming of the new island is the first time the phenomenon has happened in almost 30 years. Video footage showed smoke billowing from part of the ocean around the Ogasawara island chain and the Japanese coastguard later confirmed it was coming from the new islet. This chain, located 620miles south of the Japanese capital Tokyo, is made up of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands. Volcanologists claim the temperature of the rocks could have been as high as 1,000C. Recent images taken by the Japanese coastguard show the islet has now joined the existing Nishinoshima . The island chain in which it is located is 620miles south of the Japanese capital Tokyo and made up of over 30 islands .","The volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean began on November 20, 2013 .

"A 56-year-old Long Island man caught driving in a carpool lane alone with a fake passenger told police he has been using dummy for at least a month so he could get to his new job on time. Furthermore James Campbell, who was pulled over Friday on the Long Island Expressway at Dix Hills at 6.30am, said he intends to use the wooden creation again - and did on his way home later that day. Suffolk County Highway Patrol officer Jonathan Abrams noticed the fake, and when he approached Campbell's car he said that he needed to see the passenger's identification. 'I saved my chuckling for after I walked away from their car, and they’re not going to believe this one back at the office,' the officer told CBS New York. Scroll down for video . Sorry not sorry: James Campbell, 56, was caught in the HOV lane of the Long Island Expressway using this wooden dummy (right) as his second passenger, and says he's not afraid to do it again . Solid: The prop was made by the driver out of wooden panels, dressed up in a grey hoodie . Defiant: Campbell, who drives a two-seat pickup truck, said he created the dummy to get to his new job on time, and intends to keep using it for that very reason . Abrahams added: 'He didn’t want to be late to work, so he had assembled this thing and kept it in his car so he could use the HOV lane to get to work faster.' Campbell was issued summonses for speeding and occupancy violation. However police did not confiscate the dummy. And, speaking with media Friday night, defiantly said he has not been deterred from using it. 'I used it on the way home!' he laughed to CBS. 'I’ve been using it for months. I think it's fun. I'll change the outfits (for next time).' Having a laugh: Despite being issued summonses for speeding and occupancy violation, Campbell said he is not afraid to pull a similar move - and did on his way home on Friday . Could be better: Police said they noticed straight away the dummy was not an actual person . Officer Abrahams recalled Campbell's behavior different. 'He was definitely ashamed,' Abrahams said. Abraham's reitered what Campbell was caught doing is illegal, and patrol will remain on the lookout for him after the comments. Using dummies in HOV - high-occupency vehicle - lanes has been a problem for police all over the country for years, as dressing up dummies in order to drive in the less-populated corridors became popular.","James Campbell, 56, pulled over 6.30am Friday on Long Island Expressway .

"JetBlue have been fiercely criticised after Tweeting an ill-advised pun referencing the Hindenburg disaster. To its 1.9 million followers on Twitter, the no-frills US airline wrote 'Oh, the Bluemanity' as it showed of the designs on its aircraft tail. The phrase was a take on when radio announcer Herbert Morrison exclaimed 'Oh, the humanity!' in 1937 when he reported on the terrible disaster that left 36 people dead. Although the ill-advised Tweet was removed within minutes, people had already re-Tweeted the item . JetBlue have come in for fierce criticism after referencing the Hindenburg disaster on Twitter . Almost immediately after the poorly thought-out Tweet went live, users rounded on the company expressing their shock at the reference. Twitter user Joey White was quick to point out that while JetBlue were quick to delete, the internet 'never forgets' while most described the Tweet as 'the ultimate faux pas.' The Tweet was deleted before 10 minutes had passed, but the seed had been sown. JetBlue spokesman Morgan Johnston told the Daily News: 'We recognized it was an error. It was not well thought out, and we removed it.' The company then proceeded to reply back to users who had seriously questioned the logic of posting such a message. A total of 36 people died when the Hindenburg airship burst into flames in New Jersey, US . Replying to a shocked Jake Hamilton, JetBlue wrote: 'We got caught up in our own cleverness and didn't think it all the way through.' The Hindenburg disaster took place on May 6, 1937, as the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey, US. Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), there were 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen). One worker on the ground was also killed, making a total of 36 dead. The disaster was the subject of spectacular newsreel coverage, photographs, and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. The accident, at the time, was considered to be the worst in commercial aviation history. MailOnline Travel have contacted JetBlue and are awaiting comment.","After fierce online criticism, US airline responds back with apologies .

"Snared: Stephen Johnson of the Miami Gardens Police was jailed Friday night during a prostitution sting by the Broward Sheriff's Office . A South Florida police chief has been arrested for allegedly soliciting two prostitutes. Stephen Johnson of the Miami Gardens Police was jailed Friday night following an undercover sting by the Broward Sheriff's Office. An arrest report says 53-year-old Johnson responded to an advertisement for escorts on a website and arranged for a liaison with two women at a Dania Beach motel. Once he handed over $100, detectives posing as prostitutes arrested him. Johnson posted bond and was released early Saturday. He blamed his arrest on the pressures of his job, telling reporters, 'The stress overwhelmed me and I made a very bad decision.' The top cop was immediately fired from the post he had held for less than a year in Miami Gardens, a suburb about halfway between Miami and Fort Lauderdale. During the conversations, Johnson said he allegedly wanted to do 'everything'. The undercover detectives also asked him if he had any special requests. Johnson said he wanted the women to wear heels since he had a fetish for the footwear, according to the arrest affidavit seen by Local 10. He allegedly wanted a 30-minute session, which the detective said would cost $80. After negotiating with the cop, the made him an offer of two women for $100. Johnson then went to the unnamed motel and knocked on the door of the room where he believed he'd find the prostitute. He was then taken into custody after handing over the cash . Recently, Johnson, 53, has been dealing with the shooting death of a mentally ill man named Lavall Hall by police officer Eddo Trimino.

"British Airways has denied claims that it paid £1million to staff after it was reported the airline used specialist investigators to spy on cabin crew during a dispute with Unite over strikes. The airline allegedly accessed the private emails and phone messages of 10 members of staff, some of whom were union officials, in 2011 when it faced renewed industrial action. The compensation payment is said to have been made to stop the union suing BA over the alleged surveillance - keeping details of the operation out of court. British Airways allegedly accessed the private emails and phone messages of 10 members of staff, some of whom were union officials, in 2011 when it faced renewed industrial action. Above, file image . The claims were made in The Independent today based on information and documents that have not been seen by MailOnline. They have been categorically denied by the airline. In January 2011, just months after Len McCluskey was named the new head of Unite, British Airways cabin crew voted in favour of strikes. They were later halted after the airline successfully argued union members had not followed ballot procedures. It was part of an ongoing legal dispute that had started two years previously when BA announced plans to cut staffing levels on jumbo jet flights in a bid to save £63million a year. While the airline and the union reached an agreement in principle, the dispute became bogged down in knock-on issues about suspension of striking staff and loss of cheap travel perks. It was in January 2011 that British Airways investigators are believed to have started accessing employees' communication, according to The Independent. The airline's team of in-house investigators, based at Heathrow, was officially set up to improve passenger safety and security, the newspaper reported. But Unite claimed investigators used their skills to improperly access communication of its representatives at BA. Unite's vote to take strike action in 2011 was part of an ongoing legal dispute with British Airways that had started two years previously. Above, passengers affected by cabin crew strikes in 2010 . Some of the details uncovered by investigators were described to The Independent as being 'highly personal'. Unite, Britain's biggest union, instructed Daniel Taylor, founder of Taylor Hampton Solicitors, to represent members of staff who it claimed had been targeted by their employer. BA maintained that as it owned the mobile phones and computers owned by many of its staff, it had been acting within the law when it took the decision to 'monitor' communications of some staff. Mr Taylor is understood to have come close to an out-of-court settlement for his client, but he was reportedly dismissed  and the Union completed the final stages of negotiations with BA itself. He subsequently decided to sue the former client over unpaid fees. Invoices included in documents filed at the High Court are understood to relate to members of BA staff whose communications were allegedly accessed in 2011, according to The Independent. Mr Taylor told the newspaper that he had taken the action against Unite 'with a great deal of regret' but was prevented by a confidentiality agreement from discussing further details. A spokeswoman for British Airways told MailOnline: 'We can state categorically that we have never illegally accessed any telephones or emails of Unite representatives. 'It follows that we made no payment to Unite in relation to any such activity.' Unite told MailOnline: 'Unite dealt with Taylor Hampton over a variety of member matters. 'The subsequent dispute with Taylor Hampton over justifiable fees is just one of the things that arise in the normal course of business and has since been resolved to Unite’s satisfaction.' Taylor Hampton has been contacted by MailOnline for comment.","British Airways paid £1million after  it spied on cabin crew, it was reported .

"Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can still be tried in Massachusetts, a US appeals court ruled on Friday as it dismissed his lawyers' requests to move the case elsewhere. Tsarnaev, then aged 19, is accused of planting two bombs near the marathon finish line in April 2013 with the help of his brother, Tamerlan. The attacks killed three people and injured more than 260. His lawyers had urged the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to move the high-profile trial out of Boston, claiming prospective jurors from the area had already made up their minds about his guilt. They had argued the intense media coverage of the case and the high number of people affected by the terror attacks made it impossible for Tsarnaev to find a fair and impartial jury in Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . Suspect: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (pictured) can still be tried in Massachusetts, a US appeals court ruled on Friday as it dismissed his lawyers' requests to move the case out of the state . Attacks: Tsarnaev is accused of planting two bombs near the marathon finish line in April 2013 with the help of his brother, Tamerlan. The attacks killed three people and injured over 260. Above, one of the bombs goes off . But in a 2-1 ruling on Friday, a three-judge panel found that the defense did not meet the standards necessary to have the trial - which features 12 jurors and six alternates - moved out of the region. Chief Judge Sandra Lynch and Judge Jeffrey Howard said any high-profile case would receive high media attention, but that knowledge of such case 'does not equate to disqualifying prejudice'. 'Distinguishing between the two is at the heart of the jury selection process,' they wrote. The panel's ruling followed prosecutors' claims that Judge George O'Toole Jr's questioning of prospective jurors had successfully weeded out people with strong opinions on Tsarnaev's guilt. It was not immediately evident whether Tsarnaev's defense team could ask the federal appeals court to review the request again before a full panel of six judges, in what is deemed an 'en banc' review. On Friday, Judge Lynch and Judge Howard said it was not clear and indisputable that the publicity surrounding the former University of Massachusetts student's case required a change of venue. In court: Tsarnaev's (pictured) lawyers had urged the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to move the high-profile trial out of the state, claiming prospective jurors from the area had already made up their minds about his guilt . Defense: They had argued that the high number of people affected by the terror attacks made it impossible for Tsarnaev to find a fair and impartial jury in Massachusetts. Above, defense attorneys (L-R) Miriam Conrad, Judy Clarke and Timothy Watkins arrive at the federal courthouse on the second day of jury selection on January 6 . They added that the ongoing jury selection process did not suggest pervasive prejudice, nor did the defense team demonstrate irreparable harm if the trial was not moved out of Massachusetts. The judges noted that other high-profile terrorism cases such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the prosecution of Zacarias Moussaoui - the man who became known as the '20th hijacker' from the September 11 attacks - occurred in the district where the crimes occurred. But in a dissent, Judge Juan Torruella voiced his support for moving the trial, writing: 'If a change of venue is not required in a case like this, I cannot imagine a case where it would be. He added: 'If residents of the Eastern Division of the District of Massachusetts did not already resent Tsarnaev and predetermine his guilt, the constant reporting on the Marathon bombing and its aftermath could only further convince the prospective jurors of his guilt.' Federal appeals court: But in a 2-1 ruling on Friday, a three-judge panel at the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (pictured) found that the defense did not meet the standards necessary to have the trial moved out of Boston . A spokesman for the US attorney's office declined to comment on the ruling on Friday. A defense attorney did not immediately respond to an email from the Associated Press seeking comment. Lawyers for Tsarnaev, now aged 21, had asked O'Toole three times to move the trial. Each time, he had refused, saying bias among prospective jurors could be rooted out through carefult questioning about their thoughts on Tsarnaev and the death penalty. The same jury that will decide on Tsarnaev's guilt will also decide whether he lives or dies. If he is convicted, the only possible punishments are life in prison without parole or the death penalty. Only jurors who said they will give meaningful consideration to both can be seated on the jury. Dead: Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan (pictured, left, and, right, on the day of the high-profile bombing), is also suspected of being responsible for the fatal twin attacks. He died in a shootout with police after the bombing . Earlier this year, federal public defender Judith Mizner told the appeals court that the local jury pool is 'connected to the case in many ways' and cannot be counted on to be fair and impartial. 'This attack was viewed as an attack on the marathon itself - and an attack on Boston,' Mr Mizner told the court, adding the trial needed to be moved to maintain public confidence in the judicial system . However, Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb declared that prospective jurors who have strong opinions had 'unhesitatingly admitted' them, allowing the judge to rule them out as jurors. Tsarnaev's brother, Tamerlan, died in a shootout with police following the twin bomb attacks. Opening statements in the trial are scheduled for Wednesday.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly planted two bombs near marathon finish line .

"A woman has died in hospital after being pulled from New York's icy East River in a critical condition on Friday night. Police believe the woman - who is yet to be identified - jumped from a floating ferry pier in Brooklyn. The incident occurred at Kent Avenue near N. 5th Street in Williamsburg at about 7.30pm . According to The New York Daily News, a ferry was approaching the pier at the time the woman jumped. Scroll down for video . Scene: The NYPD, FDNY, and Coast Guard rushed to a pier in Williamsburg on Friday night after a woman leaped into freezing East River as a ferry approached about 7.30pm. Here they work to rescuscitate the woman after pulling her from the icy water . Rescue: The NYPD harbor patrol struggled to get the woman as quickly as the could have, with the amount of ice floating in the East River impeding their rescue effort. The NYPD tweeted this photo from the scene . FDNY Battalion Chief Paul Tague told WABC New York the ferry captain saw the woman jump. She was carried by the tide about three blocks south of the dock, the paper reported. Officials at the scene said the water temperature was so cold that it would kill a person after about four minutes. The woman was believed to have been in the water for about 20 minutes. The NYPD, FDNY, and Coast Guard all responded to the area near Brooklyn Bridge. Divers in protective gear entered the water. The rescue effort took longer than usual because of the amount of floating ice in the East River from the Arctic blast, police said. The woman was pulled out in an extremely critical condition. Medics at the scene administered CPR as they rushed her to Woodhull Hospital. She was pronounced dead in hospital. A diver that went into the water was also taken to hospital, but is fine. Frozen: Officials said the temperature of New York's East River is so freezing, it would kill you in less than four minutes. The woman was believed to have been in the water for 20 minutes before being pulled out . The woman's name has not been released, pending notification of next of kin. Earlier Friday a man's body was also pulled from the East River. The body was found near Murray Hills and police said it was badly decomposed. The man was wearing black pants and had no identification on him, according to The New York Post. Police are trying to establish whether there was foul play involved or if the death was accidental. February has officially been the coldest month in New York for 81 years. The average temperature in the Big Apple over the last four weeks has been 24F - 11 degrees below normal. New York joins other metropolitan areas such as Chicago and Pittsburgh, which have also experienced their most frigid February in decades. Duties continue: The tug Arabian Sea pushes a barge through the icy waters of the Hudson River on Friday, near Rhinecliff, in Upstate New York. With the prolonged cold winter weather, the Coast Guard has been busy clearing shipping lanes .","Reports of woman leaping into East River in Williamsburg at 7.30pm Friday .

"Anthony Mason, who carved out a reputation for rugged defense over 13 seasons in the NBA, including 5 on the Ewing-era New York Knicks, is dead at 48. The Knicks organization confirmed Mason's death, which the New York Daily News reported happened early Saturday morning after a struggle with heart problems. 'We would like to thank everyone for their heartfelt thoughts and strong prayers. Anthony felt each and every one. He fought like a warrior to the very end,' the Mason family said in a statement. Warrior: Anthony Mason linked up with Charles Oakley on the New York Knicks, providing a defensive mindedness that help the team be a physical presence in the 90s . Mason won a Sixth Man Award with the Knicks and later made the 2001 All-Star team while playing with the Miami Heat. It was the toughness he provided alongside Charles Oakley while surrounding franchise center Patrick Ewing that made him beloved in New York. 'MY MAN MY MAN A. MASON R.I.P, WE GONNA MISS U BROTHER,' Oakley wrote on Twitter. The 6-foot-7 Mason won the NBA's Sixth Man award in 1995 with a Knicks team that was eliminated in the second round of the playoffs in one of its classic clashes with the Indiana Pacers. Mason also won all-defensive-team honors two years later with the Charlotte Hornets. Mason struggled with heart problems in recent years and never fully recovered after a massive heart attack on February 11. Recognized: After playing in Turkey and the minors following his college career, Mason wound up in New York, where he won the Sixth Man Award in 1995 and then made the 2001 All-Star team . 'Overnight New York City and the world lost a legend, a friend, a brother... but more than anything our father, Anthony Mason,' said his son Anthony Jr, according to the New York Daily News. Knicks President Phil Jackson, who coached the Chicago Bulls teams against the '90s Knicks, said that 'as a competitor, there was none fiercer than Anthony Mason.' 'Standing on the opposite end of the playing field, coaching in those great Chicago/New York battles, No. 14 in the orange and blue always stood out,' Jackson added. Mason's career averages - 10.9 points, 8.3 rebounds - don't tell the full story of his game. A solid, muscular presence down low, Mason was there to play defense, and on coach Pat Riley's bruising teams, he could shine. All Star: While playing with the Heat in 2001, Mason was selected for the All Star Game as a replacement . Mason played for New York from 1991-1996, and then for the Hornets until 2000. He made his only All-Star team in 2001 as a member of the Miami Heat, after reuniting with Riley. 'Anthony Mason exemplified perseverance for all players fighting for their chance in the NBA,' Commissioner Adam Silver said. 'NBA fans and players around the league admired his tenacity on defense and playmaking on offense.' He wasn't all grit, though. Despite his plodding look, Mason was a nimble athlete and deft ballhandler who often showed up for games with words or designs styled into his hair. Mason was drafted in the third round out of Tennessee State in 1988 by Portland, but he never played for the Trail Blazers. After a brief stint overseas, he played sparingly in 21 games for the New Jersey Nets and Denver Nuggets before he finally caught on with Riley's defense-first Knicks in 1991. He was a force for them as they made a run to the 1994 NBA Finals, and clashed with other powerful Eastern Conference teams, including Michael Jordan's Bulls. He was dealt to Charlotte in a July 1996 trade that brought Larry Johnson to New York. W . ith the Hornets, Mason played three strong seasons in four years, missing 1998-99 due to injury, before Riley brought him to Miami, where he was coaching a Heat team that played with the same style as those Knicks teams with which Mason flourished. At Tennessee State, Mason was dominant, and was the school's first All-Ohio Valley Conference selection. In the 1987-88 season, he took a school-record 247 free throws. Anthony Mason was born Dec 14, 1966, in Miami. He went to high school in the New York City borough of Queens, where his son Anthony Jr would later play for St John's University before going on to a pro career in the minor leagues and overseas. Another son, Antoine, is at Auburn this season after transferring from Niagara, where he graduated after finishing second nationally with 25.6 points per game last season.","Anthony Mason won the NBA Sixth Man award in 1995 .

"The teenage son of a Sheikh led police on a high speed car chase the wrong way through a one way system in his mother's stolen Mercedes before crashing into a traffic light - but has avoided a driving ban. The 16-year-old, from Kensington, London, who cannot be named for legal reasons, careered through red lights with five police cars in pursuit before smashing into the pole and then hitting a taxi. The disturbing incident was caught on video by CCTV cameras in the area and shows the teenager tearing through the streets pursued by police patrol cars - at one point on the wrong side of the road - before he hits a traffic light with such force the pole is knocked over. Scroll down for video . The 16-year-old son of a Sheikh, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is pictured driving on the wrong side of the road on a one way system before hitting a traffic light - but he has not been banned from driving . His driving was so erratic the first person to make an emergency call to police told the operator the car's driver must be under the influence of alcohol. Police have now released CCTV footage of the chase after the teenager was sentenced to a 12 month rehabilitation order and 60 hours community service for his escapade - but no driving ban . Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard the teenager stole the car from outside his father's flat in a multi-million pound home in  Kensington, near to the Natural History Museum, on October 19 last year. The boy claimed a friend had driven the car the 10 miles to a house in Kingston-upon-Thames. CCTV footage from that night shows the black Mercedes speeding through the bus lane in Eden Street towards Clarence Street at 3.30am, before taking a wrong turn into oncoming traffic in Wheatfield Way. Cars were stopped at a red light when the Mercedes smashed into the traffic light. Police released CCTV footage of the chase as the teenager was sentenced to a 12 month rehabilitation order . The out of control 16 year old can be seen on CCTV footage heading towards a traffic island at full speed . One of the five police patrol cars who were in pursuit of the tearaway teenager last November . The teenager hits a traffic light, knocking it over as he tries to escape from the police patrol cars . A police officer ran towards the car and tried to open the door but the teenager was not finished - and he slammed the car into reverse as police officers ran after him . The chase only ended when the Mercedes crashed into a taxi, giving the driver minor whiplash. Police then managed to dive into the car and put the handbrake on. Last month the teenager pleaded guilty to  aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving. At earlier hearings prosecutors said the driver was alleged to have nearly run into pedestrians on three different occasions during the chase, although this was disputed. The youngster also denied driving into a police officer who tried to stop him. His parents accompanied him at his sentencing in Hammersmith Magistrates' Court, where he spoke of his deep regret and his struggles with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He sat on his mum's lap at one of the hearings, and kissed her hand at another hearing. His elderly father was also at the hearing, although the boy's parent's are now separated. Kingston police sergeant Jim Dicks said at the time of the incident: 'He had done a complete circle of the town while being pursued. One of the five police cars in pursuit arrives at the scene  - just as the teen hits the metal pole . Despite hitting the traffic light the teenager immediately put the car in reverse and tried to escape again . Police officers jump out of their patrol cars and pursue the Mercedes (bottom left) and its driver on foot . 'I don't think the driver knew where he was going - he just went round the town centre in circles. 'There were about four or five police cars involved so officers boxed him in. 'The windows got smashed and an officer dived into the car to put the handbrake up to stop him. 'I have not seen anything like this in Kingston for a long time.' Magistrate Julie Baldwin said she would enforce one of the harshest sentences she could in an aim to both punish and help rehabilitate him. She said: 'It is almost a miracle that nothing worse happened. 'There are a lot of people here rooting for you and a lot of agencies involved in this case. 'You have support from both of your parents and a successful road ahead of you is very achievable if you adhere to your order.' The teenager told the court: 'I know that someone could have been seriously hurt and I would not have been able to live with myself knowing that I had done something that foolish and stupid.' However, outside the courtroom after the sentencing the teenager realised his sentence had not included a driving ban. He excitedly shouted to his father that he was 'going to get straight on his moped' when he got home. It is not the first time he has been in court in relation to a car. The Mercedes belonging to the teenager's mum shown after the incident - it hit both a traffic light and a taxi . He was given a warning for aggravated vehicle taking in March 2011, and also has other non-driving related convictions, which were not disclosed in court. He was the subject of a youth rehabilitation order at the time of the crime. Magistrates were asked to lift the anonymity of the boy, on the basis he was a repeat offender who had endangered lives and that the public had a right to know his name. But they ruled that he was a vulnerable youth and revealing his identity was not in the public interest. The teenager was sentenced to a 12 month rehabilitation order and 60 hours community service for his escapade. He was also electronically tagged and will have to adhere to a curfew from the hours of 9pm to 7am for the next three months.","Teenager led police on a high speed car chase in his mother's Mercedes .

"These pockmarked shells are all that's left of what their owners in Debaltseve used to call their homes. The strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine was stormed by Moscow-backed separatists two weeks ago in one of the most dramatic advances by the rebels since the start of the 10-month-old war. Fighting over the city actually intensified in the days after a ceasefire deal, signed in Minsk on February 12, was meant to take effect on February 15. Rebels who had encircled Debaltseve launched a massive assault, routing all Ukrainian forces by February 18, three days after the truce was meant to come into force. Nearly a week after the retreat of government forces, bodies and body parts still lie uncollected on the streets and outside the city. Scroll down for video . A house ruined by fighting in the city of Debaltseve. The strategic railway hub in eastern Ukraine was stormed by Moscow-backed separatists two weeks ago . The shelling which destroyed this house actually intensified in the days after a ceasefire deal was signed in Minsk on February 12 . The battle for Debaltseve caught civilians, like those who lived here, in the crossfire on a scale not yet seen in the war that has killed nearly 6,000 people . A sofa still with cushions strewn across it is visible through a doorway of one ruined building. In another haunting image all that's left of a house is one wall with three windows in it, glass long since blown out by the impact of shells. A third house is pockmarked by shrapnel, its residents having long since fled. Debaltseve used to have a population of 45,000, of whom only around 6,000 now remain. Sergei had the misfortune of living on the outskirts of city near the Ukrainian army's field camp which was destroyed during the attack, along with the modest one-storey brick houses lining the nearby streets. Sergei's house was hit on February 18, right before Ukrainian forces left Debaltseve. Asked by Reuters if he knew which side attacked his house, he replied: 'Of course, it's clear. I won't say it out loud. The other side entered and shelling stopped. Not a single shell landed after that.' Asked if he thought the rebels were responsible, Sergei answered: 'Of course. But I don't get it. Why did they do it?' A woman walks past a house whose roof has caved in following fierce ighting in Debaltseve . A damaged Ukrainian army tank is left abandoned in a wrecked petrol station outside Debaltseve . A Grad rocket is lodged in the wall of a building in the jail of Chornukhyne, east of Debaltseve.

A petrol station damaged by shelling outside the city in Donetsk region. The price of petrol has doubled in the past two weeks as the Ukrainian currency has taken a plunge . An unexploded shell lies next to a gas bottle in the ruined village of Nikishino, near Debaltseve . Kiev and Western governments have accused Russia of sending troops and weapons to support the separatists in east Ukraine, despite the peace deal agreed in the Belarussian capital Minsk. Moscow has denied this. Separatist commanders said the advance at Debaltseve was necessary to 'straighten the frontline' and ease communications between their strongholds of Donetsk and Luhansk. The battle for the city caught civilians in the crossfire on a scale not yet seen in the war that has killed nearly 6,000 people. Most residential buildings in the town have been damaged by shelling or are burnt out. Nearly a week after the retreat of Ukrainian forces, bodies and body parts still lay uncollected on the streets and outside the city. In neighbouring Vuhlehirsk some 10 kilometres away, conquered by the rebels before Debaltseve, smashed armoured vehicles with the insignia of the Ukrainian army are visible and there's heavy damage to almost every building in the town. In the village of Nikishino, also near Debaltseve, the story is similar. Ukrainian military leaders and separatist commanders alike insist they never target residential areas. But rank-and-file fighters from both sides admit they used heavy weapons while fighting over the towns and could have missed targets.

A man tries to salvage something from the ruins of his house in the village. The last battle over Nikishino lasted more than seven hours . Not a single intact house remains in the village, where even the trees are covered with shrapnel . Next to the ruins of Sergei's house, a rebel gunman nicknamed Shuya was on guard at the destroyed Ukrainian camp, littered with ammunition boxes, pieces of burnt-out vehicles and unexploded shells. 'It was tanks, artillery ... I will be honest, the camp was hit very well,' he said with a smile. Another separatist fighter, who gave his nickname as Zelya, conceded it was possible they missed targets during the attack. 'Debaltseve is in a lowland. They (the Ukrainians) put their artillery there, it was hard to hit right on target,' he said. The Ukrainian side also used heavy weapons, a member of a Ukrainian artillery crew, who gave his name as Nikolai, told Reuters after the retreat from Debaltseve. 'We got shelled every day, we sat in trenches ... We also fired, of course,' said the soldier who serves in the 55th brigade. But according to his comrade who used the nickname Prapor, many areas that are now heavily damaged had been unscathed when Ukrainian forces retreated. 'We left Vuhlehirsk without any fighting... and many villages too. It should be investigated who took advantage of it,' he said. Government troops began towing artillery away from the front line on Thursday, a sign the truce could at last be taking effect. A bombed out house in Vuhlehirsk, 10km from Debaltseve.

"A 22-year-old fisherman has been sentenced to 18 months' probation after unsuccessfully trying to produce counterfeit money using three everyday items: napkins, a glue stick and an oven. Cass Alder, from Prince Edward Island, Canada, purchased a packet of table napkins emblazoned with images of his country's $100 bills and cut out the pictures of the money, a court heard. He then pasted the images to pieces of paper using glue, before briefly baking the fraudulent notes in the oven. This was to ensure the bits of napkin were firmly stuck to the paper, it was said. Then, Alder attempted to spend one of the bills at a local convenience store. However, his plan was foiled when a clerk realized that the bill was forged and contacted the police, as Alder fled the scene. Ambitious: Cass Alder, 22, has been sentenced to 18 months' probation after unsuccessfully trying to produce counterfeit money using napkins (pictured: the packet he used) emblazed with images of Canadian $100 bills . Fisherman: Alder (pictured, left, in his mug shot and, right in a Facebook photo(), from Prince Edward Island, pasted the images of the bills to pieces of paper using glue, before baking the fraudulent notes in the oven . Now, the young man, from Lennox Island, has been handed a suspended sentence for counterfeiting the $100 notes. He has also been sentenced to 60 days in jail for another fraudulent scheme. In the latter scam, Alder, who lists his job as a 'lobster fisherman' on his Facebook page, reportedly cheated H&R Block out of $5,267 of CAD (or $4,216.64 in USD) using a fraudulent tax form. Both of the charges date back to 2013, according to People magazine. At the time, drugs were said to be a 'serious issue' in Alder's life. However, during his sentencing, the former student at Charlottetown Rural High School told the court he has since turned his life around. Posing: Alder (pictured) attempted to spend one of the bills at a local convenience store. However, his plan was foiled when a clerk realized that the bill was forged and contacted the police, as the young man fled the scene . 'It took me a long time to realize I deserved better than this for myself,' said Alder, who is now in a long-term relationship and apparently has a 'strong support network' in his home community. Alder was one of several people who obtained returns they were not entitled to using the fake T4s, The Guardian reported. Half of the money was paid to the person who gave Alder the form. Alder was ordered by Chief Provincial Court Judge John Douglas to make restitution to H&R Block for half of the amount he received. The remaining half will be paid by the person behind the form.","Cass Alder, 22, of Lennox Island, Canada, purchased pack of table napkins .

"An Annapolis woman who pretended to have a medical license so she could pose as a physician's assistant will spend three years in prison.

With her phony credentials, she was trusted to diagnose 137 children and allowed to write more than 400 prescriptions. '""Shawna Michelle Gunter fraudulently posed as a licensed physician's assistant, treating patients and writing prescriptions, although she had no medical training,"" said U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein. fraudulently posed as a licensed physician's assistant, treating patients and writing prescriptions, although she had no medical training,' U.S. Attorney Rod J.

The Baltimore Sun reports that Gunter will also have to pay $53,530.39 in restitution as well as six months of home detention. Gunter's plea agreement detailed how she got the job with a prior acquaintance, a pediatrician, with offices in Centreville as well as Chestertown after lying about having graduated with a physician's assistant degree from Howard University. Once hired, she was supposed to show a physician's license, DEA certification, and proof of her education claims. Upon starting in the physician's office in July 2013 she presented a fake physician's assistant certificate and license number as well as an altered certificate and a fake diploma. The pediatrician unknowingly filed thousands of dollars in false Medicaid claims through Gunter . Some of her patients included infants and newborns. Prior to coming to that office, Gunter had been fired from her job as a surgical assistant when it was discovered that she'd stolen a check from the surgeon and forged his signature for $14,400, WJLA reports. She admitted to the forgery upon being confronted, but she also failed to repay $7,800 she borrowed.","Shawna Michelle Gunter, 37, faced charges for wire fraud and identity theft .

"Apple boss Tim Cook has warned against plans for online snooping on private emails and information in the name of fighting terrorism. Defending people's 'basic human right' to privacy, the CEO of the world's largest technology company said governments and other companies have no right to spy on emails and personal data. He added laws on snooping were not necessary to stop terrorism, but allowing authorities to access sensitive personal data would breach a 'basic human right' and have 'dire consequences'. Scroll down for video . Apple boss Tim Cook has warned snooping  in the name of fighting terrorism would have 'dire consequences' Speaking during the last leg of a trip to Europe and Israel, his views contrast those of Prime Minister David Cameron and other governments. After the terror attacks on Paris last month, Mr Cameron pledged to introduce 'more comprehensive' powers to monitor terror suspects in the UK. He promised a Conservative government after the next general election would introduce new laws to monitor all messages sent by British citizens online. But Mr Cook branded those who insist monitoring laws are needed to fight terror and crime as 'scare-mongerers'. 'None of us should accept that the government or a company or anybody should have access to all of our private information. This is a basic human right,' he told The Telegraph. 'We all have a right to privacy. We shouldn't give it up.' He added: 'History has taught us that privacy breaches have resulted in very dire consequences. Mr Cook is currently busy with the company's plans to launch the highly-anticipated smartwatch in April . Mr Cook admitted that we 'must do everything we can' to stop terrorism, but he refuses to accept that privacy needs to be compromised in order to do so. He added monitoring would only lead to terrorists encrypting their data, so the only people affected would be 'good people'. In this scenario, he believes the private, financial, health and personal data of ordinary civilians would inevitably 'be taken'. Mr Cook is currently busy with the company's plans to launch the highly-anticipated smartwatch in April. Apple has already sent out invitations for a media event in San Francisco on March 9, about a month before the new Apple Watch hits stores.

"There's now a confidential number to call if you're questioning your faith in a higher power. But instead of steering you back towards the flock, the volunteers behind the hotline hope to provide a sympathetic ear for your skepticism. CNN reports that Recovering from Religion, a secular group for those who have left or are leaving their faith, launched a hotline Friday for those questioning their religion. Nearly 100 volunteers will take confidential, anonymous calls at 1-84-I-DOUBT-IT on weekends and on weekday nights. Questioning?: Instead of pushing callers back towards the flock or into the arms of atheists, Recovering from Religion says its hotline will try to provide options and tips for those questioning their faith . Sarah Morehead, the organization's executive director, said the aim is not to make callers atheists or even provide counseling. Instead, the operators are there to listen and guide callers to other resources, whether that is finding another organization better suited to the caller's beliefs or referring those struggling with emotional anguish to counselors or a suicide hotline. It was the hundreds of emails and calls that led Recovering from Religion to start the hotline, according to Morehead. Doubts about God and their faith troubled those who contacted the organization, but without anyone to confide in, they experience depression and emotional turmoil. 'Many people feel isolated or rejected when they begin to ask questions,' Morehead said. 'If churches suddenly started welcoming doubters to their potlucks, the hot line project wouldn't be necessary.' The hotline does not use a centralized call center, and instead sends calls to volunteers through a virtual network. Doubters: Sarah Morehead, executive director of Recovering from Religion, said individuals reach out to her organization because skeptics feel excluded at their own churches . International Association of Peer Specialists executive director Steve Harrington says there are more and more groups like Recovering from Religion that provide counseling one on one. Unlike traditional treatment options, peer counseling works to connect individuals with others who have had similar experiences and can offer their own background as instruction. 'Peer supporters ask questions but don't provide answers,' Harrington said. 'They help people find their own answers.'","Recovering from Religion, a secular group for those who have left or are leaving their faith, launched a hotline Friday .

VapRwear owner Elvis 'Papi' Edwards who is from the Caribbean said he doesn't even smoke weed. Edwards' father was 'in the weed business,' he says. 'Everybody thought I was gonna be the biggest drug dealer, but I never even smoked weed!' he said. Edwards says he only smokes hemp oil out of his vapes. 'I didn’t want to get into the weed business because that’s still frowned on in my country,' he said. New suits: Rappin 4 Tay wore a Hood Horkerz pipe suit to this year's Grammy's and may be the hottest new style in LA where marijuana is partially legalized . New ideas: Sean Oliver of Hood Horlerz (pictured) says that Elvis 'Papi' Edwards stole his idea and that he paid for a patent . 'But last 4/20 in Denver, I saw this opportunity. I saw the future. Eight months later, VapRwear happened.' Oliver claims he invented a vapor sweatshirt first but Edwards says he's the vaporizer pioneer. Oliver claims he paid a lawyer to make sure no one else had thought of a similar idea, and then filed a patent for both the pipe hoodie and the vaporizer hoodie. He says the vape hoodie has been pending since 2013 but that they will manufacture them this summer. 'If you are a designer and you don’t have a smokable line, you are out of business,' Papi told BuzzFeed News. 'I swear, next New York Fashion Week, you’ll see VapRwear on the runway.' 'Oh yeah, smokable clothing is it,' Oliver echoed. “'Everyone will be wearing it soon.'

"A North Carolina man sporting a  '666' tattoo on his forehead has been charged with first-degree murder for fatally stabbing another man in a church, police say. William Everett Long, 53, stabbed George provost, 61, Thursday after the two got into an argument while making sandwiches at Duck United Methodist Church as part of a charity program in the small town of Duck, WTKR reports.

"'Radical Islam' was the pass code for entry into the 2016 presidential tryout held this week at the Conservative Political Action Conference. A mecca for tea party activists, CPAC served as the unofficial kick off to the upcoming presidential contest. Roughly 10,000 conservatives from across the country packed the  Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at National Harbor, Maryland, just down the river from the nation's capitol, to listen to GOP presidential hopefuls clobber the current occupant of the White House over his 'failed' leadership – particularly when it comes to fighting terrorists abroad. The cavalcade of the Republicans vying for the Oval Office decried President Barack Obama's calls for the global community to ignore the religious beliefs of extremists and fought to position themselves as the heir apparent to the office of the executive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . 'Egypt and Jordan recognize that they are at war with radical Islam, isn't it about time that our president proclaimed the same?' former Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared during a session on Friday morning . 'Bizarre Orwellian doublespeak': Texas Sen. Ted Cruz blasted President Barack Obama for refusing to refer to ISIS as an Islamic terror group . 'Egypt and Jordan recognize that they are at war with radical Islam; isn't it about time that our president proclaimed the same?' former Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared during a session on Friday morning. 'We need a commander in chief who will actually stand up and defend the United States of America. We cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism with a president who is unwilling to utter words radical Islamic terrorism,' fellow Texan Ted Cruz told conference guests on Thursday afternoon while blasting Obama's 'bizarre Orwellian doublespeak.' Echoing Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker that evening said the country needs a leader 'who stands up and realizes that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom-loving people around the world.' 'We need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say, ""we will take the fight to them, and not wait for them to take the fight to us"",' Walker proclaimed. He later suggested, during the question and answer period of his appearance, that his 2012 fight with public sector unions prepared him to handle terrorist threats. 'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' he posited. Asked about the viscous terrorists and what it will take to destroy them during his session, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio quipped, 'They're not Presbyterian' before laying out a strategy for victory. 'ISIS is a radical Sunni Islamic group. They need to be defeated on the ground by a Sunni military force with air support from the United States,' Rubio said, taking a stand against a large deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq. Continuing he said if the U.S. puts 'together a coalition of armed regional governments to confront [ISIS] on the ground with U.S. special forces support, logistical support, intelligence support and the most devastating air support possible,' he said, 'and you will wipe ISIS out.' Speaking at the conference later that day, Rick Santorum, the 2012 runner up for the Republican nomination for the presidency, said, 'If ISIS wants to establish a seventh-century caliphate, well, let's oblige them by bombing them back to the seventh century.' Urging the president to assume a position of leadership in the international community's fight against the 'genocidal thugs,' former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin insisted that  the religion of radical Islamists cannot be overlooked. 'Pretending it’s not there doesn’t make it go away,' she said. Calling it something else won’t make it so.' Palin, a tease who is not expected to run for president but remains a possible contender, said the State Department, whose spokesperson recently proclaimed the U.S. cannot kill its way out of a war with ISIS, is 'naive.' 'Really? Tell that to the Nazis,' Palin remarked. 'Oh wait, you can’t because they’re dead. We killed them.' Obama 'has disqualified himself, and shown himself incapable of being our commander-in-chief' by refusing to characterize savages in the Middle East as Muslims, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told a crowd later that day. 'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism,' said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said the Obama administration has a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is' 'He says we are not at war with Islam; well, certainly we’re not at war with Islam, but we are at war with radical Islam,' he asserted. Ousted Pennsylvania Sen. Santorum, once the upper chamber's third-ranking Republican, told convention-goers Obama's 'profound lack of experience' fueled many of America's problems at home and abroad. 'Commander in chief is not an entry-level position,' Santorum said. 'And the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training, not in times like this.' The former lawmaker said that unlike Obama, he predicted the 'gathering storm.' 'In the 1930s we could have known what the threat was. All we needed to do was read their books, and we will know what they want to do to the U.S.' he stated. Jindal derided the Obama administration for contending that terrorism could be counteracted by diminishing poverty in countries that are hot beds for radical activity. 'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism,' Jindal argued. 'These individuals are going to go straight to hell, exactly where they belong.' Likewise, Cruz said administration's jobs for jihadis approach 'utter and complete nonsense.' Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the last in the large group of Republican presidential wanabees to address the gathering, said the Obama administration has a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is.' That 'is very dangerous because it doesn't allow you to have the right strategy to deal with this,' Bush said. 'We need to heighten awareness of what this threat means and be honest about it,' he stated, adding that he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday 'is going to be really important.' Retired neurosugreon Ben Carsonsaid 'radical Islamic terrorists all over the world' threaten to 'destroy' America . 'He's going to be able to tell the truth on this,' Bush said of Netanyahu's address, which is likely to be critical of the Obama administration's policies toward Iran, a caliphate state. Retired neurosugreon Ben Carson, a long-shot contender for the presidency 'radical Islamic terrorists all over the world' threaten to 'destroy' America and the 'Shia in Iran are every bit as dangerous, perhaps even more dangerous' than ISIS. 'We could take our eye off the ball as they develop nuclear weapons,' he warned. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told the conservative audience that electing another Democrat of Obama's ilk, namely Hillary Clinton, would make 'us less safe.' 'Hillary’s war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists.' Jihadists now 'run amok' in the country, he said. 'They swim in our swimming pool,' he added disdainfully. 'I believe Hillary Clinton’s abdication of responsibility, her refusal to provide adequate defense for Benghazi, her dereliction of duty should forever preclude her from high office,' the freshman lawmaker asserted, denigrating his possible general election foe. 'It’s time for Hillary Clinton to permanently retire.'","Ted Cruz blasted Obama's 'bizarre Orwellian doublespeak' in refusing to label ISIS an 'Islamic' terror group .

"The world's oldest working barmaid has died aged 100 after pulling more than two million pints during her 74-year career behind the bar. Great-great grandmother Dolly Saville began her first job at a Buckinghamshire public house in 1940, when a pint cost just eight pence. Over the last seven decades she has pulled  millions of pints and served many famous faces, including James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, former Prime Minister Ted Heath, footballer Stanley Matthews, singer Vera Lynn, ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn and actress Elizabeth Taylor. Mrs Saville at work in the beer garden in The Red Lion in 1949 (left) and last year still working three days a week  (right) has sadly passed away . Until six years ago, she was still working at least six hours a day, six days a week at The Red Lion Hotel in Wendover and has only ever had two weeks sick leave her entire life. She had to reduce her shifts to three hours a week, but still spent time working on her feet clearing tables, serving customers and polishing glasses. At her 100th birthday party in April last year, she'd had no plans to stop working. 'They will have to carry me out from the Red Lion,' she said. 'I love the people, that's what keeps me going. Dolly Saville had served a number of celebrities in her 74-year career including with James Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, pictured at the Red Lion . 'I didn't think I would stay for such a long time but I've never thought about leaving.' Sam Hughes, the pub's deputy manager, said at the time: 'She's full of energy and has a good sense of humour. She keeps us all in check half the time. 'It's a shame we don't have more people like her.' The pensioner, who leaves behind three grandchildren, three great-grandchildren . and one great-great granddaughter, even had the bar she works at . named 'Dolly's' in her honour. Mrs Saville, whose two children are both retired, said last year: 'I love my work and I love the people, it keeps me going and it's better . than sitting around. 'I . never thought I would be here this long, but I've loved every minute of . it. My family keeps asking if I want to stop, but I have no plans to . retire. 'My boss is lovely and if he asked me to work an extra shift I would say yes as he has been so kind to me.' Born in Eton, Berkshire, Mrs Saville left school at 14 and went into service as a house maid. She married in her late teens and her daughter Anne was born soon after, followed by her son Roland. When war broke out several years later, her husband joined the RAF and Dolly had to get a job to support the family. Despite the fact that both her children are both retired, Mrs Saville had not wanted to give up work at the Red Lion in Wendover . She . had never done bar work before but was offered a job in the hotel by . the landlord who spotted her walking past one day with her children. She said: 'The . landlord asked if I would like to work there, but I said no as I hadn't . worked in a bar before and I never thought anymore about it. 'Then . he saw me up the High Street and asked if I'd thought anymore about it. I said I hadn't but he said 'why don't you give it a try' so I said I . would. 'I started just washing up glasses in the saloon bar. Then, . after I'd been there about five or six weeks he said I think you could . serve. 'I said 'Oh I don't think so, I'd give them the wrong change!' But I did, and I got on very well.' When Mrs Saville first started the 16th Century hotel had three bars, a public bar, a saloon bar and a cocktail bar, and she would work in all three. Her children, who were three and five at the time, would be left to play in the staff room or the beautiful hotel gardens. Dolly Saville, aged 3, in 1917, with her mother (right) and her brother Fred . Another celebrity pal: Dolly Saville with footballer Sir Stanley Matthews in 1982, one of the many celebrities she met during her time as a barmaid at The Red Lion . She said: 'I worked in all three bars and over the years I've also cooked in the kitchen, done the bedrooms, the reception and the teas. I've done the lot. 'It has always been great fun and sometimes after a long shift I would be tired but we would go out dancing.' 'Even after the hotel, which has historical links with Oliver Cromwell and Robert Louis Stevenson, was closed five years ago for six months refurbishment Dolly refused to give up work. Instead she went to the nearby King and Queen pub in Wendover, and continued working at the bars. She said: 'I was so sad when they closed for six months. 'But I went to the King and Queen instead, they asked me if I would go there and I quite enjoyed that I must say! (Left) Dolly Saville in 1979, the year that the smallpox virus was eradicated, and Dolly Saville aged 27 in 1941 (right) Mrs Saville's granddaughter Kim Leemans said: 'We tried to get her to retire years ago but she said no, so we gave up the fight and let her carry on' 'I get very bored if I'm sitting too long. I must be doing something and working keeps my brain active. 'I think that comes from when I left school at 14 and I went into private service. You had to work then, there was no nonsense, and if you didn't do it properly you did it again.' The pensioner had just started working at the bar and was just 26. King George VI was on the throne, Winston . Churchill was Prime Minister and Britain was in the grip of World War . Two. The battle of France began, and the Dutch official surrendered to the German forces. Paris was eventually bombed and invaded, while the French Resistance began their preliminary planning for guerrilla counter-attacks. Later, the 'Battle of Britain' began, with the Nazi Luftwaffe consistently bombing London, and several parts of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, at strategic points, such as docks and aeronautical manufacturing plants. This led to a period called the Blitz (a result of the British 'blackout') a pattern of strategic bombings by Nazi planes over populated areas. The draft of around 16 million men began in the U.S, prior to their involvement in the war. Also, Bugs Bunny made his debut in the Oscar-nominated cartoon short, A Wild Hare. Mrs Saville, who became famous herself for being such a long-serving bar maid, also served many celebrities. 'I served Pierce Brosnan when he had lunch at the hotel while he was filming one of the Bond films,' she said previously. 'I also made tea and toast for Ted Heath when he came in on a chilly afternoon. 'Vera Lynn has also popped into the hotel several times for lunch. I think everyone in the village knows me now.' Mrs Saville's daughter Anne Edwards, 79, from Wendover, said until she was 94 her mother would work a morning shift, come home for lunch, then go back again in the evening. 'When she started the job it was out of necessity, but I think it gradually became her life,' she added. Mrs Saville's granddaughter Kim Leemans said the family had tried to get her to retire but she would hear none if it. Robert Hynes, deputy manager, said last year: 'She is amazing and the customers absolutely love her. She has told me she doesn't want to leave until the day she dies. 'The younger members of staff aspire to be like her and think she'd brilliant. I think the job keeps her going and gives her something to look forward to. 'We get regulars who come in especially to see Dolly and in the run up to her birthday they've been travelling from further afield to see her.' Hideko Arima, from Japan, was formerly the world's oldest bar maid. She worked at her tiny bar, Gilbey Ai in Tokyo's Ginza district for 52 years until she was 101, and died in 2003.","Dolly Saville, from Buckinghamshire, had been a barmaid since 1940 .

"A suspected US drone strike Saturday in central Yemen killed three men believed to be al-Qaida militants, security officials said. The officials said the attack took place in the town of Bijan in Yemen's Shabwa province and that the nationalities of the men killed had not been established. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists. The United States has described the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) as the deadliest branch of the global extremist network (file photo of the group) Saturday's drone strike reportedly killed three men believed to be al-Qaida militants in the town of Bijan, in Yemen's Shabwa province . The U.S. has launched several strikes in recent weeks, reflecting Washington's resolve to keep fighting the militants despite Yemen's political paralysis. The Shiite Huthi militia effectively placed President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi under house arrest in January but last week he escaped to the southern city of Aden. Despite the turmoil, President Barack Obama vowed on January 25 not to let up in the US campaign against jihadists in the strife-torn Arabian Peninsula country. Within a week, a U.S. drone strike killed Harith al-Nadhari, a senior Al-Qaeda figure, and three other militants in Shabwa province, the jihadist network said on Twitter. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, as its Yemeni affiliate is known, is considered by Washington as the network's most dangerous franchise. Meanwhile Saturday, the Shiite rebels who control Yemen's capital, Sanaa, signed an agreement with Iranian authorities in Tehran to set up direct flights between the two countries, the nation's official news agency reported. President Barack Obama said on January 25 that the United States would not let up their campaign against jihadi extremists in Yemen despite the country's political turmoil (file photo) The memorandum of understanding between aviation officials from the two countries calls for 14 flights per week from each side, according to the SABA news agency, controlled by the Shiite rebels known as Houthis. Officials also discussed training for Yemenis in the aviation sector, it added. The rebels, who stormed into the capital, Sanaa, last September, are widely believed to have support from regional Shiite power Iran. Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi managed to escape Sanaa and house arrest at the hands of the rebels and has established a base in the southern city of Aden, from where he says he is still the country's rightful ruler. Also Saturday, Bahrain announced it was relocating its embassy in Yemen to Aden, a move aimed at supporting Hadi. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have done the same since Friday. Thousands of anti-Houthi protesters also marched in five provinces — Taiz, Ibb, Dhamar, Sanaa and Hodeida.","Officials said drone attack took place in Bijan in Yemen's Shabwa province .

Today, army helicopters continued to distribute food, blankets, medicine and other essentials to desperate villages that have been cut off for days. Mohammad Aslam Syas, deputy chief of the Afghanistan National Disaster Management Authority, said 186 people have been confirmed dead alone in the hard-hit Panjshir Province, 60 miles northeast of Kabul. Speaking on television, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said that he would postpone a trip to neighboring Iran to remain behind and try to help with the recovery. In an emotional address, he said: 'I can't leave my countrymen and my home alone right now'. Nationwide, the death toll from the avalanche  rose to at least 235 people killed, said Mohammad Daim Kakar, general-director for the National Disaster Management Authority.

"We are officially a nation of potty mouths, with the average Britain using up to 14 swear words a day, according to new research. From Kim Sears furious four letter tirade at the Australian open to Stephen Fry's risqué and foul-mouthed comments at the Baftas, obscenities have become more commonplace than ever. Rather than watching our language Britons are turning the air blue with expletives making up at least one in every 1,700 words used in both spoken and written British English.

According to the study one in every 170,000 words published is f*** and the average person uses between four and 14 swearwords a day. The research comes after Andy Murray's fiancée Kim Sears hit the headlines after the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych . As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’. Actress Sheridan Smith famously mouthed ‘f*****g hell’ when accepting her Bafta for Leading Actress at the 2013 ceremony for her title role in Mrs Biggs, followed by: ‘Is this a wind up? Is this for a real? You shouldn’t cry, you look like a k**b.

"Comet Lovejoy has made a surprise appearance in an image taken by the world's most powerful digital camera. The comet sprung up in a photo snapped taken by the 570-megapixel Dark Energy Camera as it was scanning the southern sky. At the time this image was taken, the comet was passing about 51 million miles (82 million km) from Earth. It appeared as a burst of green light against sky full of stars. The comet sprung up in a photo snapped taken by the 570-megapixel Dark Energy Camera in December as it was scanning the southern sky. At the time this image was taken, the comet was passing about 51 million miles (82 million km) from Earth. It appeared as a burst of green light against sky full of stars. Each of the rectangles represents one of the 62 individual fields of the camera . 'It reminds us that before we can look out beyond our galaxy to the far reaches of the universe, we need to watch out for celestial objects that are much closer to home,' wrote the team on the Dark Energy Detectives blog. The Dark Energy Camera is sensitive to light up to eight billion light years away, and so was able to capture the view in incredible detail. The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is designed to find out why the expansion of the universe is speeding up, instead of slowing down due to gravity. It is currently looking into the mystery of dark energy, the force believed to be causing that acceleration. he comet's centre is a ball of ice roughly three miles (5 km) across, and the visible head of the comet is a cloud of gas and dust about 400,000 miles (640,000 km) in diameter. Pictured is a shot taken by an amateur astronomer earlier this year . Comet Lovejoy was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world. The comet’s centre is a ball of ice roughly three miles (5 km) across, and the visible head of the comet is a cloud of gas and dust about 400,000 miles (640,000 km) in diameter. The comet's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the sun. Its tail takes on a blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains. Comet Lovejoy was first spotted by Australian Terry Lovejoy, who has a prolific record among amateur astronomers, and he named the comet. To date, Mr Lovejoy, from Queensland, has discovered five comets, all using relatively simple equipment compared to what's found at a professional observatory. It was first spotted on August 17 and in recent weeks has been dramatically captured on camera by amateur astronomers around the world. The comet's centre is a ball of ice roughly three miles (5 km) across, and the visible head of the comet is a cloud of gas and dust about 400,000 miles (640,000 km) in diameter. The comet's distinctive green glow comes from molecules of diatomic carbon - two carbon atoms joined together - and cyanogen fluorescing in the ultraviolet light from the sun. Its tail takes on a blue tinge due to the carbon monoxide it contains. Comets are essentially piles of rock, gravel, and dust held together by various kinds of ice - essentially water and carbon dioxide ice. As the comet nears the sun, its icy tail turns into a gas and blows away - due to pressure from the solar wind and sunlight. They also release dust and gravel which tend to follow the comet around the sun - and if the Earth's orbit intersects this material it results in annual meteor showers .

"He will always be best-known for his pointy ears and devotion to logic as Mr Spock - one of science fiction's towering characters. But the warp engine of Leonard Nimoy's on-screen ability in the Star Trek movies has sent more than just his own career into orbit. After the star died this Friday at the age of 83, and tributes poured in, some credited the sci-fi legend with helping them secure a life among the stars. Scroll down for video . Unlikely start: Sex and the City star Kim Cattrall posted this picture of her appearing in Star Trek VI: Undiscovered country as a female Vulcan crewmember, alongside Leonard Nimoy's Spock. The quotation is taken from Shakespeare's Anthony and Cleopatra, in which Cattrall starred onstage . RIP: Nimoy died on Friday from lung disease, his family said. He is pictured about in 2013 at the premiere of Star Trek: Into Darkness . Moving on: Cattrall, right in 2010, did not take her famous Sex and the City Role, left, until years after her turn on Star Trek . Kim Cattrall led the way, posting on Twitter that Nimoy had been her 'mentor, champion and friend'. It was accompanied by a picture of the pair, dressed in Federation uniform, onscreen in 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,' which premiered in 1991. Cattrall played Valeris in the film, a Vulcan protege who was taken under Spock's wing - but turned out to be an assassin who betrayed the crew. Years later Cattrall was cast as Samantha in 'Sex and the City,' which began in 1998, a role which eventually won her a Golden Globe. Other stars to have received a career mind meld from Nimoy include Cheers actress Kirstie Alley, most famous for her role as Rebecca Howe in Cheers. Alley played Saavik - a Vulcan officer and precursor to Cattrall's Valeris - in the iconic 'Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.' Another one: Nimoy is pictured above in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, alongside Kirstie Alley, who went on to win an Emmy in Cheers . Off the Enterprise: Alley is pictured above at a Broadway premiere in January of this year . The role was her first in a feature film, and came years before the move to her Emmy-winning Cheers role. Others best-known from beyond the Star Trek universe to share credits with Nimoy include Christopher Lloyd, who played Doc Brown in the Back to the Future films. Lloyd appeared as 'Klingon Commandrer Kruge in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock' a year before the first Back to the Future film. Nimoy directed The Search for Spock, as well as appearing briefly on-screen. Dozens of other celebrities also paid tribute to Nimoy - including erstwhile co-stars William Shatner and George Takei. Shatner, who played Captain Kirk, said: 'I loved him like a brother. We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.' Spock to the future: Christopher Lloyd, who played Doc Brown in Back to the Future, right, played a Klingon warlord, left, in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, which Nimoy directed . Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, tweeted: 'Rest in peace with the stars, my dear friend.' Zachary Quinto, who took up the character of Spock in the recent Hollywood reboot of Star Trek, also posted a touching message. He wrote: 'I love you profoundly my dear friend and I will miss you everyday.' Even President Barack Obama got involved. In a White House statement, he said: 'Leonard was Spock. Cool, logical, big-eared and level-headed, the center of Star Trek’s optimistic, inclusive vision of humanity’s future. 'I loved Spock'. Old-school: Nimoy's classic screenmates, including William Shatner, center as Captain Kirk, paid tribute to him . Nimoy's son Adam Friday confirmed the actor, adored by Trekkies all over the world, died at his home in Los Angeles. He said the cause of his father's death was end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Nimoy was catapulted to fame for his portrayal of the pointy-eared science officer Mr Spock in the cult TV series, first launched in the 60s and followed by a string of films. His half-human, half-Vulcan character was the calm counterpoint to William Shatner's often-emotional Captain Kirk in a series that attracted a worldwide fan base. Although Nimoy followed the original 1966-69 Star Trek run with a notable career as an actor, director, writer and photographer, in the public's mind he would always be Spock. The actor left a poignant final message for fans on his Twitter account last Sunday, including a reference to his famous sign-off 'Live Long And Prosper'.","Star Trek legend, 83, died  on Friday from lung disease - prompting tributes .

"A mother-of-two is desperately trying to raise £6,000 for medical treatment to stop her nine-year-old daughter's constant hiccups. Trudi Veremu's daughter Eden, aged nine, from Brixton in South London, began suffering from a bout of 'super-charged hiccups' in November last year – and she has not stopped hiccuping since. Eden is believed to be one of only 50 people in the world to suffer from diaphragm disorder Mycolonus Diaphramatic Flutter, which is also known as 'Belly Dancer's Syndrome'. Mother-of-two Trudi Veremu's daughter Eden, aged nine, (pictured) from Brixton in South London, began suffering from a bout of 'super-charged hiccups' last year – and she has not stopped hiccuping since . The hiccups are so strong that it makes Eden's speech vibrate and causes an involuntary punctuation in each word she speaks. The condition means she suffers from quick-fire spasms in the lungs and throat causing sharp intakes of breath. However, she has not yet been formally diagnosed and her worried family want to take her to see a specialist in the United States for diagnosis and treatment. 'We are 99 per cent sure she has it, but it's matter of confirming that,' her mother told MailOnline. Now Ms Veremu, 37, is campaigning to raise £6,000 so Eden can be taken to Colorado Children’s Hospital in an attempt to beat the debilitating condition. Her mother says she needs to be treated as quickly as possible before the illness becomes life-threatening. If Eden is diagnosed with the illness she will be the first person in Britain to have it. Trudi Veremu (centre) has launched a fundraiser to pay for her daughter Eden’s (left) treatment in the U.S . Ms Veremu said: 'It has been relentless and I am so worried for my girl. 'The attacks came out of the blue and have not stopped for months. 'When they are most severe, she is in excruciating agony and unable to talk at all.' Ms Veremu, who runs a music management company, added: 'The pain, stress and migraines it causes knocks her out for days - only for the same to happen again. 'The NHS have been great but we do not have time on our side and given how rare this disorder is, we have to go to where it’s known best.' Eden is due to travel to the United States in March for treatment at Colorado Children's Hospital. Children from Eden's primary school in Kennington are among the hundreds of well-wishers who have so far raised more than £2,630 towards the  total £6,000 needed for the trip. To donate visit the Go Fund Me page. Mycolonus diaphragmatic flutter - or Belly Dancer's Syndrome - is very rare. Only about 50 people in the world have been diagnosed with it. It was first discovered by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723. The condition sounds like a short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. The rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the an average rate of 150. No single treatment has proven effective, but most involve the blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve. One notable case is Chaz Moore of Colorado Springs, Colorado - he tried several medications, but says only medical marijuana worked.","Eden, 9, has been suffering from 'super-charged hiccups' since November .

"Camilla Kerslake says she and Chris Robshaw (pictured together) are on the 'same page' and plan to get married in the near future . As England's redoubtable rugby captain, it's likely Chris Robshaw will be feeling the pressure when he steps out for this afternoon's Six Nations match in Dublin. But even though the crucial game with Ireland looks set to be the championship decider, the rugged 28-year-old may well see it as blessed relief from the pressure he is under to make an honest woman of Camilla Kerslake, his opera-singing girlfriend of four years. He hasn't actually proposed. But as Camilla makes clear today, that's no obstacle at all. 'Chris and I are on the same page and we definitely plan to get married in the near future,' the 26-year-old tells The Mail on Sunday in her first interview about her famous boyfriend. 'Some people call it a pre-engagement. It's all about timing – at the moment we're both so busy with work. 'I even had to spend Valentine's Day outside in the cold sandwiched between hordes of angry men as I cheered Chris on during his game.' 'Pre-engagement' is a growing trend, with thousands of couples now choosing 'promise' rings ahead of a formal proposal. Camilla, though, has her eye on the real thing, and has been spotted scouting engagement rocks at Tiffany. So far, her hulking 6ft 2in boyfriend has been notably reticent when friends have quizzed him on the subject. But Camilla appears undeterred. 'It's tricky now as I'm currently locked away in the studio recording my third album and Chris is obviously incredibly busy and focused on his rugby and the Six Nations. But he gets back from England camp in April and the Six Nations boys have some time off in May and weekends off in June, so we'll have more time to ourselves then. As soon as things calm down for both of us work-wise, we'll start making plans.' But she's keen to point out there's no pressure. 'I am not pushing him,' she adds. 'Nor are our mums, but all his friends are teasing him all the time. We've been together for four years and are both each other's serious long-term relationship. I expect that is why everyone is asking, but our futures are definitely together. We both agree on that.' Four years ago British-born Camilla – who has a Welsh mother and Kiwi father and spent much of her childhood in New Zealand – was riding high with a successful operatic career. Chris asked for her number within two minutes of meeting her at a rugby event where she was singing. 'My manager who was with me said I shouldn't give it to him,' Camilla confesses. 'I said, 'Of course I will. Just look at him, he's gorgeous.' But it took a month before we met. 'At the time he was in England's second team, while I was working on my second album and my career was on a great trajectory. We decided to be monogamous when we started going out.' England captain Chris Robshaw in action for England during a Six Nations match against Wales . If the first test of their compatibility was tolerating the demands of each other's careers, the next was both more serious and challenging. 'My mother Deborah was diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2011, just after my second record came out and I was about to tour the country,' Camilla says. 'It was followed by various complications so I cancelled the tour and all my singing engagements to look after her. I absolutely adore her. 'In 2012 Chris suggested I move in with him as he only lived a mile away from my parents' home in Kingston upon Thames. It meant I could go to look after her easily every day. 'We moved in together before we had been dating for a year, which would have strained lots of relationships but it didn't with us. He is easy to live with and there is no way I would have made it through without him. He was absolutely my rock.' He was equally supportive when the family finances were in a poor state and Camilla tried to get back to work. 'When my mother was ill my parents' income dropped by half,' she reveals. Here the couple are pictured at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards in December 2012 . 'I helped out but I wasn't earning either and in 2012 I was bankrupt in all but name. It wasn't easy. The music industry moves on very fast and agents and people in the business who had been desperately asking me to do various concerts suddenly wouldn't take my calls. It was awful and I also discovered that many of the friends I thought I had were just celebrity hangers-on and were no longer interested in me.' Despite the lack of a formal proposal, the couple have discussed in detail how they want to live their lives including, she says, the wedding. 'When we first got together Chris told me he wanted children before he was 30,' she recalls. 'He is 29 in June so that might have to change.' That is also the month her album is out, which should leave them free, she says, to think about wedding plans. 'I don't want a big wedding but Chris is quite keen,' she insists. 'So I think it will be low-key but pretty. I have my hair and make-up done every time I am on stage and wear ball gowns as a uniform, so it is not that important for me to dress up. For me, it is more about family and friends. 'It's every girl's dream to have the perfect white wedding, but I think on her wedding day the bride should wear whatever she wants to make her feel special.' Refreshingly confident about her own appearance, she continues: 'For some, if that means showing cleavage then so be it – especially if you've got something to show. 'If I do reveal any cleavage in my dress at least they'll be real, not fake like some people assume they are. Whenever I get my boobs out they always seem to spark raging debates about whether they're real or not. I can tell you, they are completely natural.' Is she worried about female fans trying to steal Chris away? Not at all, she says firmly. 'Obviously he is gorgeous, a complete catch and I am very lucky to have snatched him,' she says, smiling. 'Equally luckily, he is not that type of man. He is kind, generous, humble and believes in loyalty. 'Loyalty is particularly important when you play for England.'","Camilla Kerslake says she and Chris Robshaw are on the 'same page'

"It has become one of the worst kept secrets in technology - with everything from models to the real thing being spotted and posted online. Now it appears one of Samsung's own ads has been leaked, revealing the two handsets the firm hope can topple the iPhone. Samsung's Galaxy S6 is expected to appear in a radical Edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on Sunday, while the standard version looks like an iPhone 6. Scroll down for video . A leaked Samsung advert reveals the two new Galaxy handsets, the S6 and the S6 Edge - which are not being officially announced until Sunday. CNET Korea also revealed these images, which it claims show the final Galaxy S6 Edge. Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display. Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera. More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Note Edge. Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March. Both phones will be revealed at a special event in Barcelona before the Mobile World Congress begins there on Monday. A 'verified employee' on Reddit called iamdenden posted the following teaser revealing the Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge, the latter with its curved display. A series of photos from  CNET Korea also claims this is the official handset. The images were posted to the xda-developer website. No other information about the handsets was posted. Another user also posted pictures of the standard version of the handset on the same forum. 'Can't say where it's from but it's from AT&T directly,' the poster said. 'Obviously a prototype or test model and it says not for sale on the package. 'Obviously a phone, I was scared to play with it much but seems a glass back and front with metal on the sides.' 'Our source, who has seen Samsung's new devices in person, tells us that the mid-level 64GB curved Galaxy S6 will cost carriers €949 ($1,076), with the top-end 128GB model priced at €1,049 ($1,189)—around €50 more expensive than the comparable iPhone 6 Plus.' The same source also said the firm is having yield issues for the curved display, which could mean the handset is in very short supply when it launches. Reports claim the ground breaking handset could be prohibitively expensive - and that Samsung is struggling to make the screen. According to a source at one of Samsung's mobile carrier partners in Europe who spoke to Ars Technica under the condition of anonymity, Samsung is launching both the curved and normal Galaxy S6 at high price points. Samsung's new Galaxy S6 handsets are revealed in this image, it has been claimed. is expected to appear in a radical Edge version with curved screens when it is unveiled on Sunday, while the standard version looks like an iPhone 6. The Standard version of Samsung's Galaxy S6, which will be revealed on Sunday. The firm has been showing off the curved screen in teaser adverts, but is believed to be struggling to manufacture them in large quantities. For the non-curved Galaxy S6, European pricing is €749 ($849), €849 ($963), and €949 ($1,076) for the 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB models respectively - $100 cheaper than the curved version. The site warns that these high prices could dent the phone's popularity. 'The pricing of both the normal and curved versions of the Galaxy S6, however—if carriers pass the price hike onto consumers—could be problematic unless the hardware is truly sensational.' Samsung is set to unveil the handset in Barcelona on March 1st. The Galaxy Edge will have curved screens on each side, and the Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. Created by designes Ivo Marić and Jermaine Smit, the new renders show both expected versions - a standard one and an 'Edge' with both sides having curved displays. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. And the curved screen has already been used in Samsung's Galaxy Note Edge. However, the S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right-handed mode . Users will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them. Both phones are also expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The handsets are also set to include wireless charging capabilities. And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in. Many current phones need specially-designed cases and accessories to charge wirelessly, but Samsung's next-generation models could add the feature within the handset on a single chip. In a blog post by Seho Park, principal engineer in Samsung Electronics' IT and mobile division wrote: '2015 will be a landmark year for the growth of wireless charging. The S6 is expected to look similar to Apple's iPhone 6 handset . It will also include a rumoured 20 megapixel camera . 'With our upcoming Galaxy smartphones, users will be able to enter a new wireless world like never before.' The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides. Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers. There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). Samsung is a member of all three groups. This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features. The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 already offers this feature - but the Lumia 920 runs on the Qi standard. The concept video shows both handset designs . Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers. There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). Samsung is a member of all three groups. This means manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example.

Samsung's next Galaxy phones are expected to be the first to support these multiple standards on a built-in chip. Samsung's next Galaxy phones are, however, expected to be the first to support multiple standards on a built-in chip. This means they will be more versatile to take advantage of public charging ports being introduced across retailers such as McDonalds and Starbucks. It will also beat main rival Apple to introducing the technology. Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The use of the plural 'smartphones' in the blog post adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. Samsung's invite (pictured) hints at a curved device and the firm is expected to announced the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge . The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. Both phones are expected to have all-metal bodies, in a move away from Samsung's current plastic range, and 5.1-inch screens. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple.

"A Brisbane couple haven't been able to have 'pain-free sex' for the nine years they've been married, due to the wife's rare medical condition. Michaela, 38, and James Reece, 34, have launched an online appeal with hopes to raise treatment funds for vaginismus, which they say isn't available in Australia. Mrs Reece was diagnosed with the condition after experiencing what she described as 'excruciatingly pain' the first time she tried to have sex with her husband during their honeymoon. The disorder causes the vaginal muscles to involuntarily tighten. Medical experts say there is no cure for the condition which affects a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration including sexual intercourse. Michaela, 38, and James Reece, 34, have launched an online appeal with hopes to raise treatment funds for vaginismus, which isn't available in Australia . Mrs Reece was diagnosed with the condition after experiencing what she described as 'excruciatingly painful' the first time she tried to have sex with her husband during their honeymoon . The couple have shared how they 'fell madly in love' when they first met but waited to have sex. 'Jimmy made a decision at the age of 14 that he would wait for his wedding night to have sex with his wife,' they wrote on Go Fund Me. 'We met, fell madly in love and dated and waited for 21 months before we got married.' The couple continued to explain how they were 'very excited for our honeymoon', considering Mr Reece was 25 and a virgin. 'Imagine our heartbreak when sex was excruciatingly painful - to the point of impossible - and ended up in infection,' they wrote. 'This has been our reality ever since. Three years and many specialists and misdiagnoses would pass before we would finally be given a name for this condition.' The couple are hoping to have 'pain-free sex' for their 10 year anniversary in December . Mrs Reece's has told of her frustrations of 'never being able to have sex' with the person she loves. 'Imagine being with the one person you love but never being able to have sex with them,' she told the Courier Mail. Dr Geetha Venkat told MailOnline that many women have vaginismus, a common but rarely discussed condition. The disorder causes the vaginal muscles to involuntarily tighten and is often dubbed 'vaginal panic attacks'. It affects a woman’s ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration, including sexual intercourse, insertion of tampons and gynaecological examinations. She says vaginismus is the result of an involuntary reflex contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle, which supports the vagina. It is estimated that millions around the world suffer from it, but Dr Venkat says women should not suffer in silence. Treatment usually includes seeing a sex therapist or a cognitive behavioural therapist to find the triggers behind this problem. While the condition can never be cured completely, it does improve with treatment. One recent development is using Botox injections to relax the muscles in the area. 'Every birthday, every anniversary, every new year that goes by means I still can't be with my husband properly and it's torture.' Mrs Reece describes vaginismus as 'an involuntary muscle spasm which causes any penetration to be excruciatingly painful.' Medical experts say it is estimated that millions around the world suffer from it, explaining that vaginismus is the result of an involuntary reflex contraction of the pubococcygeus muscle which supports the vagina. But for Mr and Mrs Reece, they've travelled across Australia but failed to find the right sort of treatment for this disorder. 'It has broken us. Brought us to tears. And eventually became a thing we just didn't talk about. Until now,' they wrote on their fund-raising page. So when they came across a vaginismus support page on Facebook, they discovered that other women suffering from the same condition flew to New York for treatment at the Women's Therapy Centre. The couple wrote that the treatment and travel costs will total to about $25,000 but are hoping to raise $15,000. 'Our 10 year anniversary is coming up in December this year,' they wrote. 'It'd be lovely if this was the year that we could be together in ""that way"" for the first time.' They hope to travel to New York for two weeks of treatment in October.","Michaela and James Reece have been married for nine years .

"A delapidated house with no working toilet inside the house has unexpectedly sold for $2.17 million at auction, $570,000 over reserve price. 268 Doncaster Ave, Kensington, in Sydney's south-east, was sold to an investor on Saturday afternoon after belonging to the same family for 50 years. 'The place was very run down. To say it was in a liveable condition would be kind,' estate agent Joe Recep, of NG Farah Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . 268 Doncaster Ave, Kensington, in Sydney's south-east, was sold to an investor on Saturday for $2.17 million . The four-bedroom house, which had peeling paint, mould in the bathroom, unkempt lawns, and renter's clothing around the yard, went under the hammer with 27 registered bidders, reported The Daily Telegraph. 'There were four male university students renting the property and they were a bit messy, which didn't make our lives very easy,' he said. The reserve price for the property had been set at $1.6 million, slightly lower than other houses in the area due to the smaller land size. The deceased estate had been used as a rental property for eight years, and due to it's close proximity to the University of New South Wales, the house had already garnered significant interest prior to the auction. Mr Recep said that the auction had gotten off to a slow start, and they had to enter a vendor bid to prompt the bidding. The deceased estate had been used as a rental property for eight years . The four-bedroom house had peeling paint, mould in the bathroom, untidy lawns, and clothing around the yard . The new owner reportedly had no inspections done on the property . 'At one point it looked like the property wasn't going to sell at all. Then the bids started going up by $50,000, then $20,000, then $10,000,' he said. 'Then it went to $2.17 million, to an investor who hadn't even seen the property until today.' The new owner reportedly had no inspections done on the property. Siblings Victor Bubba and Rosina Vaccarella grew up in the Kensington property, and said that the sale price blew them away. 'I was thinking we’d maybe get $1.8 million, but then when I saw the state of it this morning I doubted that. I never would have thought it would got for more than $2 million,' Mrs Vaccarella said.

'But at the end of the day it's in a great location. Coogee Beach is only five minutes away, the biggest university in Australia is a few hundred metres walk, and there are plenty of good schools in the area,' he said.

"Zimbabwe's president marked his 91st birthday celebrations with a terrifying speech in which he threatened to seize land and animal sanctuaries owned by white people. Thousands of loyal supporters attended the $1million party at the lavish resort town of Victoria falls near the world-famous waterfall. In the televised address, Robert Mugabe vowed to 'invade' the farms and animal sanctuaries still owned by whites - who he claims still own vast amounts of the country's land. He added: 'Zimbabwe has lots of safaris but very few are African. Most are white-owned. In our region, we have the most safaris and animals. Our people cannot keep suffering.' Scroll down for video . Oppressive: Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe threatened to evict white farmers from their lands during a speech on his 91st birthday party . Living in luxury: Mugabe addressed thousands of loyal supporters at the $1million party at the lavish resort town of Victoria Falls . Celebration: The youth officials who organised the elaborate affair encouraged Mugabe to hold his position as president until he dies . Threats: In the televised address, Robert Mugabe vowed to 'invade' the farmland and animal sanctuaries still owned by white people . When the country gained independence in 1980, white farmers who made up less than one per cent of the population owned around 70 per cent of the best farming land. But in April 2000, Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party pushed through controversial land reform which allowed the government to confiscate white-owned land and distribute it to black farmers without having to pay them compensation. Now the Commercial Farmers Union which represents white farmers in the country says fewer than 300, out of the previous 4,500, remain one land following the purge. During the hour-long speech on February 21, Mugage said he would allow whites to keep their animal sanctuaries if the United States removes sanctions imposed on him, his wife and members of his inner circle. Flanked by his two deputies, senior government officials, his children and wife Grace, he added: 'We can do things for ourselves. We don't need the white man to continue to guide us.' His impassioned performance at the age of 91 dispelled any speculation the ageing dictator is slowing down, following the widely-mocked fall he suffered at Harare airport. Aggressive: During the hour-long speech, Mugabe said he would allow white people to keep their animal sanctuaries if the United States withdrew the sanctions imposed on him . Passionate: Mugabe's controversial and robust performance in front of thousands of ZANU-PF supporters dispelled speculation the leader was slowing down following his fall at Harare airport . Outrage: He was flanked by his two deputies, senior government officials, his children and wife Grace as he launched into a tirade against Western nations . Dictator: The controversial leader - who has led the country since its independence in 1980 - said white people still own the majority of land in the country . Change: In April 2000, Mugabe and his ZANU-PF party pushed through controversial land reform which allowed the government to confiscate white-owned land and distribute it to black farmers . The Zimbabwean leader has self-proclaimed himself as a 'champion of post-colonial Africa' but has faced constant and robust condemnation from Western nations and human rights groups who claim he crushes dissent with violence, torture and death. He was among a handful of African leaders - including South Africa's former president Nelson Mandela - who fought white domination in their countries. But while Mandela served a single term in office before retiring, Mugabe has tightened his grip on Zimbabwe's leadership since assuming office in 1980. The youth officials who organised his birthday party have encouraged him to hold the position until he dies. This year, he became chairman of the 54-nation African Union. He also heads a regional group of 15 southern African nations. Freedom fighter: Mugabe was among a handful of African leaders - including South Africa's former president Nelson Mandela - who fought white domination in their countries . Loyal support: Mugabe turned 91 on the 21st of February to become the worlds oldest leader with his supporters saying they will back him to run his full term until 2018 . In an interview on state television on Friday, Mugabe said he would not pick a successor to his ruling ZANU-PF party. He said: 'I don't choose my successor, never. I was not appointed successor by anyone,' Mugabe said. 'The successor can come from any level of the party. It may be either of the vice presidents, but it's up to the people.' Last December ZANU-PF re-elected Mugabe, making him candidate in the next election in 2018 when he will be 94. Mugabe denies media reports he is suffering from prostate cancer and maintains his several trips to Singapore are for routine medical checks and to fix a recurring eye problem.","Zimbabwe president celebrated with $1million party at lavish Victoria Falls .

"The two-year-old who tragically died after a 30-metre gum tree fell on his home when wild thunderstorms swept through Melbourne has been identified. Eli Marnock was asleep in his bedroom at The Patch in the Dandenong Ranges, east of Melbourne, just after 11pm when the tree - which had been reported as unsafe by the toddler's grandfather to the council - crushed the home, the Herald Sun reported . Emergency services rushed to the scene but were unable to save Eli who tragically died in his cot. Scroll down for video . The two-year-old crushed by a gum tree in Melbourne's east has been identified Eli Marnock (left) Seven family members were in the home at the time, including Eli's five-year-old sister Nicola, who was watching television when she sustained injuries to her leg chest and face. Nicola was rushed to the Royal Children's Hospital and is now in a stable condition. Neighbours have expressed their frustration at the Yarra Ranges Council as they had not acted on earlier complaints to remove the tree that fell. One neighbour saying Eli’s grandfather, John Surridge, had recently made multiple requests to the council to check trees on the property. Emergency services rush to the scene where a large tree fell on a family home with seven inside . Neighbours say the council should have torn the trees down after  earlier safety concerns . Geoff Davis, Ambulance Victoria's acting Group Manager, says the large tree fell causing severe structural damage to the home. ‘Two Urban Search And Rescue trained paramedics crawled under the tree to find the young boy and unfortunately he had died,’ Mr Davis said in a statement.

"Is this Jihadi George? Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary could be one of the so-called 'Beatles' alongside Mohammed Emwazi . A London rapper who fled to Syria could be Jihadi George - the second of the ISIS hostage-taking cell known as 'The Beatles'. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary slipped out of Britain to join the barbaric extremists in 2013 and may have done so alongside Mohammed Emwazi, who was unmasked as Jihadi John earlier this week. Bary, dubbed the 'hip-hop jihadist', and Emwazi grew up just streets apart in west London and one expert last night claimed it made sense for both men to be part of the sick 'Beatles' kidnap group. The two militants are believed to know each other and it is possible that Bary is one of the captors known as George, the Daily Telegraph reported. Released hostages have previously revealed that their kidnappers were known as the Beatles because of their British accents. Haras Rafiq, managing director of the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, said: 'It would make sense that Bary could well be George.' The security services long-suspected that Emwazi was not the only Briton among the terrorist group. Bary was a rising talent in London's hip-hop scene - performing under the name L Jinny - before leaving his parents' £1million home in Maida Vale to fight in Syria. Last year many believed he could be ISIS executioner Jihadi John - the masked terrorist who has appeared in a number of the extremists' sickening beheading videos who is now known to be Emwazi. Although Bary shares many similar facial features with Emwazi, security officials ruled him out as the terrorist ringleader using voice recognition software. Bary (left), dubbed the 'hip-hop jihadist', was initially suspected to be Jihadi John - unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi (right) - because of their similar facial features . Rapper: Bary (pictured), 'dubbed the hip-hop jihadist', and Emwazi grew up just streets apart in west London . Fighter: After travelling to Syria in 2013, Bary posted pictures online showing him wielding machine guns . Pictures of Bary before he fled from the UK show him wearing western labels such as Adidas hoodies as he raps in a studio, while another shot shows him squaring up to riot police. But once he reached Syria, pictures emerged of him wielding a machine gun, an AK-47 and an M16 assault rifle while wearing military fatigues. Many of the images came from a Facebook page dating back to 2012 which has since been deleted. In posts alongside the images he attacks 'western propaganda' and wrote: 'Shame on you Muslims that are embarrassed of mujahids/jihads...' In another post he added: 'Those who strive to defend the lives and freedom of helpless women and children are branded as blackguards, extremists, Islamists and terrorists.' Bary also posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed head of a Syrian soldier, accompanied by a joke. A former friend said: 'People have got into his head - it's transformed a talented young guy into a vengeful extremist.' Bary was last said to be in Raqqa, a Syrian ISIS stronghold believed to be near where some of the beheading videos have been filmed. Both Emwazi and Bary left Britain in 2013, meaning it could well be possible that they travelled together. Bary also posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed head of a Syrian soldier . Both Emwazi (pictured) and Bary left Britain in 2013, making it possible that they travelled together . Emwazi first tried to leave Britain in 2009, claiming he was going to Tanzania on safari with a group of friends. He was sent back to the UK after security officials feared he was attempting to join terrorist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Emwazi tried to leave Britain for Kuwait in 2010 and 2013, but was stopped by security officials once more. He disappeared from his parents' home a week later, with his parents reporting him missing after three days. They claim it was four months before police arrived at their home and said they had information he was in Syria. A source who claimed to have met Emwazi in Syria told Channel 4 News that he was a member of one of the earliest groups from London who travelled to fight for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate.","Londoner Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary could be Jihadi George, expert says .

"Shy: Kirsten Farage said she has to stay at home and look after their children because husband Nigel’s job running Ukip means she is effectively a single mother . Her husband is never shy of a photo opportunity and revels in the limelight. But Kirsten Farage is keen to shun the ‘sad’ role of a traditional party leader’s wife. The 48-year-old, who is seldom seen in public, said she has to stay at home and look after their children because husband Nigel’s job running Ukip means she is effectively a single mother. As she made a rare appearance at the party’s spring conference in Kent yesterday, German-born Mrs Farage said she keeps a deliberately low profile. Asked if she would be joining her husband on stage to embrace and kiss him after his speech, she replied: ‘No. Definitely not. That’s really quite sad.’ Party sources say Mrs Farage is ‘brilliantly intelligent’ and a key figure behind the scenes, but she insists she will not be playing a more high-profile role during the General Election campaign. ‘I work from home and Nigel is never there, so I am a single mother in many ways,’ the mother-of-two joked. ‘Someone has to be there and take the children to school.’ In a clue to their domestic arrangements, Mrs Farage revealed that her husband did not even know where basic household equipment was kept. ‘He just called me and asked where do we keep the ironing board as he needed to iron his shirt,’ she said. ‘I’m not that surprised. It is a bit worrying.’ Mrs Farage said that she finds public interest in her ‘mad’, but added that people only recognise her when they read her name badge at events. She said: ‘There are a lot more interesting people than me.’ Mr Farage met his second wife in Frankfurt in 1996, while he was on business shortly after his divorce from his first wife Grainne, the mother of his two grown-up sons. ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance,’ he has said. ‘She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting, no questions asked.’ Mr Farage married Kirsten in 1999. They have two daughters aged nine and 14. Asked about the contradiction of having a German wife while railing against immigration, Mr Farage has previously deflected the question by joking that their marriage is proof he loves Europe. His gruelling schedule as party leader means that he gets up at 5am and works seven days a week, travelling on average eight hours a day to speak at meetings across the country. Mr Farage has previously admitted that he has not spent enough time with his children. He said: ‘In an ideal world children benefit from having some sense of stability with preferably two parents and not one. ‘And that really, for more than the last decade, has not been the case with me. ‘Men tend to be more single-minded and selfish in terms of the choices they make and the effect it has on their families.’ Busy man: Nigel Farage's gruelling schedule as party leader means that he gets up at 5am and works seven days a week, travelling on average eight hours a day to speak at meetings across the country . Mrs Farage’s stance contrasts with that of David Cameron’s wife Samantha and Ed Miliband’s wife Justine Thornton, who traditionally appear on stage at party conferences. After Mr Miliband’s speech last year, there was an embarrassing mishap as he moved in to kiss Miss Thornton – but missed. Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam has repeatedly shown her independent spirit at Liberal Democrat conferences. Rather than going up to the podium to fawn over her husband, she waits for him to come off stage to join her.

"'I know how hard people work just to make ends meet': Billionaire Jeff Greene, 60, and wife Mei Sze . A  billionaire hedge fund manager who sparked outrage for telling Americans to lower their expectations so they have 'less things' in life now says he was misquoted. Jeff Greene also says he wants to continue the fight against inequality - even if it means being the 'poster boy for the insensitive upper class'. Greene, a self-made businessman worth around $3 billion, spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, reportedly saying he believes people in the United States need to stop aiming so high and start living with less. 'America's lifestyle expectations are far too high and need to be adjusted so we have less things and a smaller, better existence,' he was quoted in an interview with Bloomberg. The 60-year-old, who ran for the Democratic Senate nomination in Florida in 2010, was lambasted not just for his words, but for flying into the Swiss conference on a private jet, with his 19-year younger wife, Mei Sze, children and two nannies. Now, in trying to clear up the debacle in a piece for CNN, the investment banker says 'the quote was credited to me and I know that I never said it'. Greene goes on to defend himself and the wealthy against suggestions they only care about themselves and their money. 'But what bothered me most in all this was how this whole incident fed a narrative that the wealthy are detached, that they just don't care. 'In fact, the people I spoke with while I was (at the World Economic Forum) were without exception concerned about the struggles of individuals and families affected by globalization, disruptive technologies, and most of all the long-term challenge of economic inequality. 'I can say these things from experience - I have often talked about this issue, calling for policies to bolster the middle class and even expressing support for increasing taxes on the wealthy. 'As a guy who grew up in middle class Worcester, Massachusetts, I know how hard people work just to make ends meet and how years of stalled income growth can drain people of their hope and optimism. 'I saw it myself growing up when my father lost his business. Correction: Jeff Greene claims he never said controversial comments attributed to him last month, and has offered advice for America's future economy and the detructive employment sector. He is seen here with his wife, Mei Sze, and his son . This is 'living with less'?: Billionaire property investor Jeff Greene was quoted saying the 'lifestyle expectations of Americans is far too high' and is the owner of America's most expensive home - this Beverly Hills estate - which is listed for $195 million . 'As a result of what I have seen and experienced growing up and as a businessman I have continued to the problem of inequality many times and voiced support for education, investment in infrastructure, and economic policies to aid those who are middle class and those who aspire to be.' Greene goes on to say that 'elected leaders' are not doing enough to prepare for future changes in industry that will lead to job busts. He references the introduction of cab-hailing app Uber and the effect it has had on car services and cab drivers. He also cites developments like 3D printing as something that will put many people out of work in the future. 'These developments pose a profound challenge to the United States, and we'll need a comprehensive strategy that draws on the best ideas available to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed,' Green wrote in the CNN op-ed. Controversial: Property developer and investor Jeff Greene was quoted saying America should rethink its high lifestyle expectations after arriving by private jet to Switzerland, but says he never made the comments .

In 2013, Greene spoke of owning a $2 million Cessna Caravan seaplane that he said saved him valuable time commuting between his homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and the Hamptons and New York City, where he conducts much of his business. He told The Real Deal that the plane cut a journey of more than three hours to just 35 minutes, employing two full-time pilots. He said he and his wife Mei Sze Chan used it around 40 to 50 hours a month for themselves and friends.

"Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield's old flight suit turned up in a Toronto thrift shop, but how it ended up on sale for $40, not even the former commander of the International Space Station knows. 'That's a mystery to me as to how it got there,' Hadfield wrote to the woman who discovered the suit, Dr Julielynn Wong, CBC reports. Wong says she was browsing a vintage clothing store on Queen Street West in the Parkdale neighborhood of Toronto when she came upon a true gem. Finders keepers: Dr Julielynn Wong, pictured in her own flight suit from her work at Ontario Science Centre Challenger Learning Centre, purchased Hadfield's suit on markdown .

"It is New York's best kept secret - apparently. According to newly revealed records, Neir's Tavern is the oldest bar in the city. The rustic gin hall in Queen's opened in 1829, is said to have hosted Mae West's first ever performance and numerous movies including a scene in Goodfellas. It means McSorley's Old Ale House in the East Village - whose motto is 'we were here before you were born' - is pushed into second place, having opened in 1854. Scroll down for video . New York's best kept secret? According to newly revealed records, Neir's Tavern is the oldest bar in the city . Pushed into second place? McSorley's Old Ale House in the East Village claims to be the oldest . However, Gregory de la Haba, publican of McSorley's, refuses to relinquish his grip on the accolade. McSorley's is credited as the city's oldest Irish pub, and was 'men only' until 1970 when it was forced to admit women. He insists theirs was the only bar to serve New Yorkers through the prohibition. 'McSorley’s is the oldest continuously operating bar in New York City,' he told the New York Daily News, adding, 'and it’s the most authentic — hands down.' 'What you are looking for is authenticity and not age.' Neir's opened as The Blue Pump Room by the owner of a racecourse which was then across the street. Claim to fame: Robert DeNiro filmed part of Goodfellas in the Queens-based bar Neir's . Now, 180 years after opening as a racecourse watering hole, it has a new set of regulars . Authentic: The place was renovated to restore the original mahogany work put in by Louis Neir in 1898 . It has original art framed on the wall, around the floor where Mae West allegedly first performed . Celebration: Local historians are excited about the newly-revealed documents that bring pride to the area . History in writing: Documents that chart the history of the bar are now framed on the walls . Understated: The bar claims to 'quietly serve cold beer' rather than boasting about their heritage . In 1835 it was renamed The Old Abbey. According to Neir's website, the racecourse went through a bumpy financial patch, and the bar became known as a 'notorious rumseller' for 'black legs, thieves, housebreakers [and] fighting men'. It was bought in 1851 by a politician who maintained it for 40 years, before a man named Louis Neir arrived in 1898. Neir's Social Hall, as he dubbed it, was extended to include a ballroom, bowling alley, and hotel rooms. It was sold in 1967 and renamed the Union Course Tavern, which closed in 2009. The current owners finished constructing Neir's mahogany bars, and reopened as Neir's Tavern. Battle of the bars? McSorley's, a favorite among Manhattanites, has long been touted the oldest in New York . People flock to clink ale tankards around the distinctive round wooden tables surrounded by pictures . Knees-up: A waiter clutches 10 pints as he makes his way around the tables of customers . Enjoying themselves: A group of guys chew fat over drinks with historic newspapers framed around them . It was one of the last 'men only' bars in New York until it was forced to admit women in 1970 . One of the bar's mottoes is said to be 'We were here before you were born' Another of the mottoes inscribed above this cabinet is 'be good or be gone' Every piece of paraphernalia and memorabilia ever hung on the walls remains, including badges and boards . Atmospheric: The Irish pub still has a rustic feel to it, which New Yorkers relish in the winter . According to the Queens Tribune, Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta became regulars at the watering hole while filming Goodfellas and harboring a deep affection for it. Ben Stiller's 2011 movie Tower Heist also featured scenes in the bar, causing the owners to close down for four days. Queens Historical Society's Richard Hourahan, who read through the archived documents, told the Daily News: 'I'm really excited about what this means for Queens. 'It shows some of our cultural and social history.' The owners of Neir's appear less fussed about fighting their corner for the title. The bar's website states: 'While many older bars tout how old they are, Neirs has remained true to itself, quietly serving cold beer to our local customers for over 180 years.'","Neir's Tavern opened in 1829, hosted Mae West's first performance .

"As a thoroughly modern prince, William has been credited with bringing the Royal Family into the 21st Century. But the second in line to the Throne was only too happy to play the role of ancient tyrant when he dressed up as one of Japan’s most notorious Samurai warlords. The Prince looked positively imperious when he donned the glittering helmet and red and gold tunic of Toyotomi Hideyoshi the formidable 16th Century warrior who ruled Japan with a rod of iron. Scroll down for video . The Duke of Cambridge was transformed into a samurai warlord during a visit to the set of a long-running Japanese television drama .

The Duke was transformed into Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the famous Japanese warlord who unified his country in the 16th century . William donned the costume while on a visit to the set of Taiga, a long-running TV period drama which tells stories from Japan’s past. Hideoyshi is regarded as one of Japan’s ‘great unifiers’ but his rule was characterised by a draconian clampdown on individual liberties. He introduced laws which meant only the Samurai could carry weapons and he ordered the crucifixion of 26 Christians in a bid to stop the spread of the religion. But the Prince couldn’t help but laugh when he saw his completed look. He asked ‘How do I look?’ and when he was given his own replica weapon, he joked: ‘I feel ready for action. I feel there should be a sword in my hand.’ However William refused to wear the traditional Samurai ponytail wig because he said his younger brother Prince Harry would ‘never let him forget it’. When he first arrived at the studios of Japan’s public broadcaster NHK he was greeted by a long line of actors dressed as soldiers and actress Mao Inoue, who was dressed in a traditional kimono. He asked one of the senior staff, ‘Is it a show like EastEnders?’ before being taken on to the set depicting a chaya, or tea house, which Samurai warriors used as a members’ club.

Before dressing in his Samurai gear, the Prince watched three geisha actresses dance, while another played a three-stringed instrument, called a shamisen. At the end of the performance he tried strumming it himself and said, ‘It’s a wonderful noise’. William also proved to be something of a clown prince when he joined Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on a visit to the Smile Kids’ Park in Koriyama.

"A dress believed to be the custom gown taken from Lupita Nyong'o's hotel room earlier this week has been recovered, a sheriff's official said on Friday. Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says the dress found on Friday afternoon at a West Hollywood hotel 'greatly resembles' the pearl-adorned Calvin Klein dress Nyong'o wore to Sunday's Academy Awards. And it seems the thief had a change of heart after realizing the pearls on the dress were fake, not realizing the estimated $150,000 cost of the gown was more a reflection of the couture-quality work that went into its creation and not in fact the baubles adoring it. Scroll down for video . Returned:  Lupita Nyongo's' $150,000 Oscars dress has been returned to her West Hollywood hotel, pictured at the Academy Awards . Lupita's dress was found stashed in a bathroom at The London hotel in West Hollywood. The thief called TMZ to say he had returned it after claiming the pearls it was made of are fake . Police recovered the dress and are investigating the case . Furthermore, neither Nyong'o, her stylist Micaela Erlanger or Calvin Klein creative director Francisco Copsta ever said the gown was adorned with real pearls. Speaking about the discovery on Saturday, Nyong'o said to Women's Wear Daily: 'I'm happy that it has been potentially recovered. It's a timeless and priceless piece of art.' Meanwhile, the Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman adds that detectives are attempting to verify the recovered dress is the same one Nyong'o wore. 'We do have possession of a dress that greatly reassembles the dress that was stolen but I don't think at this time we can 100 percent say it's that dress, but it greatly resembles it,' Nishida said. One of the actress' representatives reported the dress was stolen from Nyong'o's room at the London Hotel in West Hollywood late Wednesday. Authorities said it could have been taken during a broad time frame earlier in the day. Authorities placed its value at $150,000, although experts say it could have fetched more on the black market. A special dress: The custom Calvin Klein gown reportedly featured 6,000 pearls and was taken from Lupita's room at the London Hotel sometime on Tuesday . The recovery of the dress was first reported by celebrity website TMZ, which wrote in a post that a person claiming to have taken the gown gave them information about where to find the dress. The thief had removed two of the pearls from the dress and taken them in to be valued when they learned they were fake. The dress recovered on Friday afternoon was found in an abandoned bathroom at the London Hotel, sheriff's officials wrote in a press release. Nyong'o won an Oscar in 2014 for her role in Twelve Years a Slave and was a presenter at Sunday's ceremony. Her publicists declined comment on Friday evening. The 31-year-old actress has become a darling of Hollywood's red carpets in the past two years, with commenters and fans praising her fashion choices. She accessorized the dress with Chopard diamond drop earrings and three Chopard diamond rings. Before the awards ceremony, Nyong'o told The Associated Press on the red carpet, 'I'm just wearing my diamonds and pearls. My homage to Prince,' referring to a popular song by the musician. 'There are a lot of collectors out there who are very private and have private collections of stolen merchandise,' said style expert and fashion commentator Mary Alice Stephenson. 'Some of these dresses have global fame as big as any Van Gogh.' Scene of the crime: TMZ reported that the dress was likely taken from The London Hotel between 8am and 9pm while the actress was out on Tuesday . The dress had been reported missing on Tuesday, with Lupita telling police it must have been taken from her room between 8 am and 9 pm, while she was out. The London also confirmed the incident, saying: 'This is a terribly unfortunate situation, and we are working with law enforcement on their investigation.' On Wednesday the actress shared a timelapse video of her pre-Oscars prep which shows her with her style team in her hotel room getting her glammed up  before the big event. And the morning after the Oscars, Lupita shared a snap of her beautiful accessories she'd worn for the night and captioned: 'That was cool! #Oscars 2015 #DiamondsAndPearls' Laid out on top of her frock were some stunning Chopard jewels and satin Nicholas Kirkwood heels alongside a silver box clutch. Lupita returned to the Oscars after winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress last year for her work in 12 Years A Slave. 'This year the pressure's off,' Lupita told E! host Ryan Seacrest during the E! red carpet show. She added: I can just dress up and enjoy the show' The actress was recently attached to the film Queen Of Katwe based on the true story of Ugandan chess prodigy Phiona Mutesi.

"A senior Iranian cleric made a vow to 'raise the flag of Islam over the White House' in retaliation for an attack that did not involved American troops. Ali Shirazi, an aide to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation's supreme leader, reportedly made the threat in comments published by the nation's feared Revolutionary Guard. He said the takeover of Washington would be part of a 'resistance front' led by Iranians in revenge for the deaths of its soldiers, and members of the militant group Hezbollah. Threat: Iranian cleric Ali Shirazi made the remark. He is pictured above in 2005 speaking in front of a picture of the nation's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei . New flag? Shirazi conjured an image of an Iranian-led 'resistance front' that would overwhelm the West . The men were reportedly killed by Israeli attack helicopters in the Golan Heights, which contains the border between Syria and Israel. According to the Jerusalem Post, Shirazi was speaking at a ceremony for the dead guardsmen. He said: 'The resistance front led by Iran would retaliate from the global arrogance of killing [Iranians] and Hezbollah men... we will raise the flag of Islam over the White House'. The Jerusalem Post reported that the men killed in the chopper attack were establishing a terror base from which to bombard Israel with rocket fire. Although the U.S. appears to have had no role in the attack, it is often mentioned in the same breath as Israel because of its financial and diplomatic support for the nation. Similar: ISIS press officer Abu Mosa made similar claims last year - but was killed by an air strike soon after . His words echo similar threats made by ISIS, even though Iran is at war with the terror group. In behind-the-front-lines footage obtained by Vice News last year, Islamic State press office Abu Mosa can be seen making the exact same boast to the camera during a battle with Syrian soldiers. He said: ‘I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established and we will not stop. Don’t be cowards and attack us with drones. ‘Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq. We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing. And we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.’ However, just a few weeks after the video aired, it was reported that Mosa had been killed in an air strike by Syrian forces.","Ali Shirazi, an aide to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made threat in a speech .

"A Ukrainian man believes he has the longest eyelashes in the world - and credits the incredible growth to a special food which he keeps a close-guarded secret. Valery Smagliy, 58, from Kiev, says he noticed their increased length after changing his diet and thinks the key to their transformation could earn him a fortune. He has kept the amazing-looking lashes until now as he enjoys the attention they attract from women - but says he has finally decided to trim them. Secret recipe: Valery Smagliy saw his eyelashes grow to an enormous length after changing his diet and he says he wants to keep the food item responsible for the growth a secret . Mr Smagliy said: 'I started eating something and noticed that my eyelashes really started growing quickly at the same time, and I'm thinking of marketing it so I'm not giving away the secret of what it is.' After noticing how jealous women were of the natural enormous eyelashes, he realised his secret could end up being lucrative. He added: 'Women would stop me in the street and ask me what the secret was, they can see that they are real and not fake. 'And whether it's man or woman, most people don't seem to pay much attention when I'm talking to them because they're always looking at my eyelashes. 'But to be honest they are just heavy now and my eyelids are getting sore. And it's also difficult to see properly with huge grey eyelashes in front of my eye. Before trimming them he plans to visit the local registry office of the Guinness Book of Records to have them officially measured. The lashes currently stand at around 3cm long but Smagliy has decided to trim them as he has tired of the reaction they provoke . According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest eyelash ever recorded was 6.99 cm (2.75 in) long and belonged to American Stuart Muller's left upper lid. The eyelash was measured in Gainesville, Florida, USA on 7 December 2007. Pondering on his decision to have them cut, Mr Smagliy added: 'I suppose I could go for the world record, but to be honest what's the point? 'I prefer to be able to see better and I plan to get them cut in a professional salon so I reckon they will still look pretty good afterwards.' The director of the National Registry of Records, Lana Vetrova said they plan to announce the official length of the eyelashes next week.","Valery Smagliy saw his lashes grow to enormous length after changing diet .

"Captain Brandon Bocian, pictured, is the US Marine whose injury prompted Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey to launch his death-defying rescue attempt . A US Marine who was saved by a paratrooper who became the first living Briton to win the Victoria Cross for his service in Afghanistan can be revealed today. Captain Brandon Bocian was on his second tour of the war-torn country when he was shot under intense fire in Helmand Province by the Taliban. Briton Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, 27, ran through a hail of insurgent machine gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades three times to save the injured comrade. Speaking about the event for the first time yesterday, Captain Bocian said: ‘I hadn’t met Lance Corporal Leakey prior to that day but am grateful for his actions. ‘The fact that he chose to leave his position to help me speaks to his courage and character. ‘I am happy to hear that he is being formally recognised. He deserves it.’ Captain Bocian, who has been serving in the US Marines since 2009, is an infantry officer currently serving as an instructor for entry-level Marine officers teaching leadership and combat skills. He had been on his second tour and was over half way through when he came went out on his first combined operation with UK forces, including 1 Para. He said: ‘I was part of the command element on a hill in an overwatch position for a UK/US clearing operation. ‘Our position began receiving effective enemy fire and we maneuvered to a different position. ‘Along the way, enemy fire intensified, we took cover behind terrain and I began directing fire onto the enemy. ‘That’s when I was hit’. As he lay on the ground in agony, Lance Corporal Leakey showed ‘complete disregard for his own safety’ and ran to the wounded officer despite being under attack from 20 Taliban. ‘Lance Corporal Leakey arrived at my position and immediately started tending to my wound. ‘With the bleeding under control, he assisted me to a hasty landing zone and stayed until I was loaded on the medivac helicopter. ‘That was the last time I saw him.’ Lance Corporal Leakey became the first living soldier to be awarded the VC, the highest military decoration for valour, in ten years and only the second since 1969, in a ceremony held at Lancaster House in London on Thursday. His cousin Sergeant Nigel Gray Leakey was a posthumous recipient of the VC in November 1945 for his gallantry while fighting in Africa in 1941 during the Second World War. Lance Corporal Leakey, who joined 1 Para in 2007 and has served three tours of Afghanistan, said he was 'deeply honoured' but played down his heroism. 'The only thing I was really scared of was letting my cap badge down,' he said. Afterwards he said: 'I am just a normal bloke. I happen to be in The Parachute Regiment and on that particular day at that particular time I was in that place'. He insisted the award was 'going to be worn on behalf' of everyone in his regiment and battalion. 'It is very humbling that this has happened to me,' he said. He will receive his medal for the role he played during a combined UK and US assault on a Taliban stronghold in August 2013. Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, pictured, received the Victoria Cross for rescuing Captain Bocian . According to the official citation, the 1 Para hero showed 'complete disregard for his own safety' as the force came under attack from around 20 insurgents armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in Helmand province. The firefight lasted for around an hour. 'Displaying gritty leadership well above that expected of his rank, Lance Corporal Leakey's actions single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life, allowing a wounded officer to be evacuated,' the citation said. The US Marine Corps captain was shot and wounded and the force's communications had gone down. First, Lance Corporal Leakey dashed across a barren hillside which was being raked with enemy fire and undeterred by the 'very clear and present danger', he gave first aid to the wounded officer. But with the 'snap and crack' of enemy fire all around him, he realised that two of his group's machine gun teams had been surrounded. Despite being the most junior member of the force he took control of the situation and began the casualty evacuation. He went back up the hill and took control of one of the machine guns – with bullets ricocheting off the gun's frame – before running down again, drawing enemy fire. His 'courageous' action spurred those around him to fight back with renewed ferocity. But the firefight continued. Lance Corporal Leakey, 'with the full knowledge of the dangers', exposed himself to Taliban fire once more. Weighed down with 60lb of equipment, he ran to the bottom of the hill, picked up a second machine gun and climbed back up the hill. Drawing the majority of enemy fire, with rounds flying past his head, he opened fire. Then he handed over the machine gun to a comrade and supervised the evacuation of the wounded officer. During the battle 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. The Marine officer made a full recovery. Lance Corporal Leakey, from Hampshire, is single with no children. His father was in the RAF. He said: 'It's part of the very nature of being in the Army, and especially the Parachute Regiment, that we have to adapt to situations you don't expect to happen. 'That's why I joined the Army – to be a paratrooper – I wasn't interested in doing anything else. 'In my mind the biggest fear is letting the side down, letting your regiment down and not doing your cap badge proud.'","Captain Brandon Bocian was shot by the Taliban in August 2013 .

"Landfill workers called police after seeing Oregon's disgraced former first couple dumping trash after learning they would be the subject of a federal investigation. John Kitzhaber, who resigned as the state's governor last week, and his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, were seen at the Knott Landfill Site in the city of Bend. With federal investigators looking into the scandal that forced Kitzhaber to quit, employees alerted authorities after the pair paid a visit. Kitzhaber bowed to pressure following months of news reports alleging Hayes used her relationship with him to land clients for her consulting business. The probe is looking into possible corruption and financial crimes including wire or mail fraud, bribery and tax evasion . Controversial: John Kitzhaber, who resigned as Oregon's governor last week, and his fiancée, Cylvia Hayes, were spotted dumping trash into a landfill site in the midst of a federal probe . Stepped down: Kitzhaber bowed to pressure following months of news reports alleging Hayes used her relationship with him to land clients for her consulting business . Deschutes County sheriff's deputies poked through the couple's trash for about an hour, Timm Schimke, director of the county's solid waste department, told the Bend Bulletin. The Knott Landfill is located just outside Bend, where Hayes owns a home. 'They looked like any other people who were cleaning out their garage or cleaning out a rental. It was just stuff,' Schimke said. 'They weren't manipulating the stuff. They were just tossing it out, and they were only in there for two or three minutes and then they left.' Their trash included old campaign signs for Hayes, who ran for the Legislature more than a decade ago, and a mattress or box spring, Schimke said. Kitzhaber resigned last week under pressure over Hayes' work for advocacy groups with an interest in state policy. Federal authorities are investigating. Kitzhaber has denied the couple did anything wrong. 'It just seemed strange that they were at a transfer station dumping waste so soon after him resigning and them being under investigation,' Schimke said. Darryl Nakahira, legal counsel at the Sheriff's Office, is forwarding all questions and requests for information to the FBI, which doesn't respond to inquiries involving ongoing criminal investigations. Alert: Employees at The Knott Landfill Site in Bend, Oregon, called the police after noticing the couple . Hayes — at the center of an ethics scandal that forced the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber — has launched a legal fight to keep her private emails out of the public eye. The lawsuit came to light Thursday, the same day that Oracle Inc., the tech giant that built Oregon's botched health insurance exchange, filed a lawsuit against several of Kitzhaber's former campaign advisers. The company accuses Kitzhaber's advisers of orchestrating the abandonment of the Cover Oregon website to help his re-election effort. Oracle also served notice that it may sue Kitzhaber and his former chief of staff. The flurry of lawsuits keeps alive two controversies that weighed on Oregon's once-popular governor. Hayes, who is engaged to marry the former Democratic governor, filed a lawsuit Wednesday against The Oregonian asking a judge to rule that she is not required to turn over her emails to the newspaper. She's resisting an order from the state Department of Justice that says emails from her private email accounts that concern state business must be provided to The Oregonian, which requested them under the state's public records law.","John Kitzhaber and fiancee Cylvia Hayes arrived at The Knot Landfill site .

"The city of Cleveland has come out against the family of a 12-year-old boy who was killed at the hands of a police officer. Tamir Rice was shot dead by an officer just two seconds after the cop encountered the boy, who was holding a gun, playing in a park with his sister on November 22. The initial call of complaint came from someone who told the dispatcher the gun was 'probably fake' and the gun ultimately turned out to be a non-lethal pellet gun. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit and now the city has responded by saying the young boy failed 'to exercise due care to avoid injury.' Scroll down for video . The city of Cleveland has issued a response to the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Tamir Rice (above) Tamir, 12, was shot dead (above) by a police officer two seconds after arriving on the scene even though the boy was holding a pellet gun . The city has said that Tamir (above) failed 'to exercise due care to avoid injury' when he was shot by police officer Timothy Loehmann . The city also stated in their response, obtained by Cleveland.com, that Tamir died because of 'the conduct of individuals or entities other than Defendant.' The Defendant is police officer Timothy Loehmann. Also named as a plantiff in the family's suit in Tamir's sister Tajai, 14, who was tackled by an officer as she ran towards the body of her brother screaming 'my baby brother, they killed my baby brother.' The officers then handcuffed the young girl and threw her in the back of a squad car. At no point was Tamir given medical attention until an FBI agent on a nearby bank detail arrived, almost five minutes after the shooting. The entire incident, from the moment police arrive on the scene to when Tajai is taken down and handcuffed to the arrival of the agent who provided first aid, was caught on video which the city was initially reluctant to release it to the public. Tamir's family (above) filed a wrongful death lawsuit in January . A police union official at the time said the officers thought the gun was real and that they didn't know Tamir, who was 5' 7"" and weighed 195lbs, was so young. Police were also not told that the call of complaint came from someone who told the dispatcher Tamir was a child and that the gun he had was 'probably fake.' The city in their filing also claimed to have no knowledge of Loehmann's checkered pass and reports he had used excessive force numerous times in the past. Despite the city's response, the family's attorney, Walter Madison, said on Friday; 'I do believe that a 12-year-old child died unnecessarily at the hands of Cleveland police officers and I do believe that certain officers shouldn't have been entitled to wear the uniform.'","The city of Cleveland has issued a response to the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of Tamir Rice .

"Extremist: Haitham al-Haddad's speech has been pospon . An extremist preacher is still set to speak at Jihadi John's former university after this week's talk was postponed due to 'security concerns' on the day the Islamic State executioner was unmasked. Haitham al-Haddad was set to visit the University of Westminster on Thursday, despite more than 3,000 people signing a petition - launched by the  lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) society - opposing the event. Last night, the  Islamic Society (ISOC) said it has no links with Mohammed Emwazi - the Londoner revealed to be Islamic State's merciless executioner Jihadi John - and is not associated with any extremist organisations. But in a statement, the society said: 'The ISOC will not be going back on the decision to invite Shaykh Haitham al-Haddad to our event, nor will we apologise for doing so. 'We are more than happy to invite our esteemed teacher to provide us with beneficial knowledge once again, and have no qualms with looking to invite him again in the future.' The visit was postponed due to 'increased sensitivity and security concerns' after Jihadi John's true identity was revealed. Today, a spokesman for the university told MailOnline: 'All Student Union events with external speakers or any events that have been deemed sensitive have been suspended.' Earlier this week, former student Raheem Kassam claimed the University of Westminster was a 'hotbed of radicalism' where students 'celebrated 9/11'. Mr Kassam, who now campaigns against extremism at British universities, said the conditions at the university are right for the radicalisation of someone like Emwazi. He said: ‘I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly unsurprised. ‘The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there. 'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. ‘Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters.' Scroll down for video . Petition: Haitham al-Haddad was set to speak on Thursday but the event was postponed afer it was revealed 'Jihadi John' studied computer programming at the university . Unmasked: ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John' was this week identified as Mohammed Emwazi, 26, from London . In 2012, the Student Rights - an organisation set up to combat extremism in universities - found a number of videos featuring convicted terrorists and members of terrorist organisations overseas had been shared with students at the university via Facebook. According to the Henry Jackson Society - a think tank which works alongside Student Rights - only last year Murtaza Khan was invited to speak at the Islamic Society’s annual dinner. The title of his speech was The Day of Judgment. Khan has a history of encouraging communal division, once asking: ‘For how long do we have to see our mothers, sisters, and daughters having to uncover themselves before these filthy non-Muslim doctors?’ It's claimed he has also encouraged British Muslims to turn their back on our customs and rituals. It has been reported this week's planned speaker, Dr al-Haddad, said gays should be outlawed,  terror boss Osama bin Laden will go to heaven, Jewish people are descended from 'apes and pigs', and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation, but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted. He serves as a judge for the Islamic Sharia Council and is chairman of the Muslim Research and Development Foundation. This organisation says it is ‘devoted to the articulation of classical Islamic principles in a manner that provides a platform for Islam to be the cure of all humanity’s ills'. It has been reported Dr Al-Hadda said gays should be outlawed, terror boss Osama bin Laden will go to heaven and has also spoken out in favour of female genital mutilation, but he has claimed in the past his comments have been misinterpreted . The statement from ISOC said the event - entitled Who is Muhammad? - would have been a lecture on the Prophet Muhammad and no LGBT topics were scheduled to be discussed. 'We have invited him because, despite the bad press he continually receives, the malignant rumours and misquotations gleefully spread about him, he is one of the most knowledgeable Islamic figures in the UK, and the ISOC is honoured to invite him to speak for us,' it added. 'Individuals who are upset and believe Shaykh Haitham supports FGM (female genital mutilation) and is a virulent homophobe have been suckered in by the aforementioned scaremongering carried out against him, a man who has given up a massive portion of his life simply to the betterment and education of a much-maligned, ostracised and pressured Muslim community in the UK.' But the university has also been criticised for segregating male and female students during talks by Islamic scholars. It was one of 21 university institutions which were found to promote gender segregation. 'I did not know him, he would have been two years behind me, but I am utterly, utterly unsurprised,' Mr Kassam said. 'The university was nothing less than a hotbed of radicalism when I was there. 'Are the conditions at Westminster right for the radicalisation of someone like him? The answer is yes, 100 per cent. 'I once walked into a meeting of the Islamic Society where they were clapping and cheering the events of 9/11. It was at that moment in my life I realised I wanted to set up an organisation in my life to tackle it. 'Having been brought up in a Muslim household and then seeing that happening is pretty galling stuff. 'Universities across the country, the University of Westminster in particular, are being targeted by radical recruiters. These guys [students] are being professionally radicalised. They tried it with me and they try it with any Muslim. 'I remember very vividly how I would get cornered by three or four Somali guys - students in the class with me who were dressed in non-western clothing – and they would say I must come along to the Islamic Society meetings otherwise I’m not a proper Muslim. 'When you are 18-years-old and a practising Muslim you feel inclined to go. I went along and saw what was happening and it absolutely disgusted me.' A spokesman from the University of Westminster said: 'We take these allegations very seriously. We condemn any behaviour that promotes terrorism and violence on any of our campuses. 'We have strict policies to promote tolerance among our 20,000 student community, who come to study from over 150 nations. 'Any student found to be engaging in radicalised activity would be referred to disciplinary procedures. 'As a London-based university operating in a diverse multi-cultural city, we are fully aware of all the influences within this international city. With other universities in London, we are working together to implement the Government’s Prevent strategy to tackle extremism. 'We strongly encourage anyone who is concerned about radicalisation to speak out and contact the Student Support and Well-being team. The safety and security of our students is our foremost concern.' Research by Student Rights - a group which aims to prevent extremism at universities - said that from September to March 2013, 46 events at 21 separate institutions were found to have been segregated. At the University of Westminster, at least two events were found to have been advertised as ‘women only’. But the university claims it does not allow gender segregation and it will 'not tolerate this type of prejudice'. 'The university strictly complies with the Equality Act 2010 the Human Rights Act 1998,' a spokesman said. 'The events concerned were not gender segregated events. 'The Islamic Society is one of many societies that are part of the University of Westminster Students’ Union which is an independent body. The university does not control its activities but does monitor that it is legally compliant.' MailOnline contacted Dr al-Haddad for a comment but received no reply.

"With her arms outstretched as she plunges helplessly to the seabed, this is Les Miserables star Samantha Barks ‘drowning’ in a controversial new campaign which claims it’s cruel to eat fish. Animal rights activists Peta says the striking image tries to give a sense of the suffering fish go through when they are taken out of water. Vegetarian Samantha, 24, right, who took the role of Eponine in the 2011 film musical, said: ‘I have a fascination with fish but I think that people see them as lesser than other animals. 'A dog looks like they’re going to cry when they’re upset and you can’t help but empathise with them. 'But fish feel pain just the way other animals do.’ A Peta spokesman added: ‘Fish can’t scream as we can, but they certainly suffer.’ Some experts have found evidence that fish can feel pain. One landmark study by scientists from the University of Edinburgh found that trout experience pain in ways comparable to higher mammals. However, biologist Dr Bruno Broughton, who advises the fisheries industry, said: ‘Biologically, it has emphatically not been proven that fish feel pain. 'They lack the advanced part of the forebrain – the neocortex – that deals with pain recognition.’","Samantha Barks features in a new disturbing advertisement for Peta .

"John Bercow has been accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ after pocketing thousands of pounds from ‘second jobs’ outside Westminster . Commons Speaker John Bercow has been accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ after pocketing thousands of pounds from ‘second jobs’ outside Westminster – while criticising other MPs who do the same. Mr Bercow infuriated Tory MPs last week by appearing to back Labour plans to crack down on MPs being allowed outside earnings on top of their Commons work. He said that ‘a lot of members of the public would expect MPs to do a full-time job’. But this newspaper has established that before becoming the £142,800- a-year Speaker in 2009, Mr Bercow himself earned large sums from ‘outside earnings’ as a backbench MP. The MPs’ register of interests shows Mr Bercow had a job worth up to £40,000 a year advising a firm in the Priory Group, the mental health treatment company behind the well-known Priory ‘rehab’ clinics. Based on his declarations, Mr Bercow began the work in November 2008 but gave up the job in June 2009 when he was made Speaker. He also declared income for providing ‘communications training’ to staff of Chase Manhattan Bank between 1998 and 2002 but no further details were given. And in 2002 and 2003, he was also a paid non-executive of energy firm Kent and Essex Wind Energy. Mr Bercow, who has been MP for Buckingham since 1997, gave up his outside interests when he took the Speaker’s chair in 2009. The promotion led to his basic MP’s salary being more than doubled while he and his family also moved into the taxpayer-funded, ‘grace-and-favour’ residence in the Commons. Last night, Tory critics said Mr Bercow had no right to criticise MPs, who earn a basic £67,000, for having second jobs. Tory MP Michael Fabricant said: ‘Given that the Speaker used to have outside jobs, many people will think his comments against them are rank hypocrisy. Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, pictured, told undercover reporters that he had a usual fee of between £5,000 to £8,000 for a half-day's work for representing private companies . It is pretty rich for him to talk about MPs’ extra earnings as he lives in a grace-and-favour house, gets paid as much, if not more than, the Prime Minister and also has a very generous pension.’ Mr Fabricant also pointed out that Mr Bercow, who has previously been accused of ‘Labour bias’, made his latest remarks ahead of an attempt by Ed Miliband to change Commons rules and bar MPs from paid directorships and consultancies. Mr Bercow’s remarks on the long-established practice of MPs having second jobs, but having to declare them, came after two former foreign secretaries, Tory Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Labour’s Jack Straw, were embroiled in a ‘cash-for-access’ row. He said: ‘People should not be in Parliament to add to their personal fortune.’ Last night Mr Bercow declined to comment on the ‘hypocrisy’ claims. But his spokesman said: ‘The Speaker has held no paid position outside his office since his election to the chair in 2009. Details of his salary and pension are matters of public record.’","Commons Speaker has been accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ after appearing to back Labour plans to crack down on MPs being allowed outside earnings .
