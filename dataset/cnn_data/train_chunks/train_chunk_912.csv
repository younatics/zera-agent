Southampton fans may feel their club is being stripped and sold for parts, but it isn't all doom and gloom as they find themselves top of the pre-season table.

West Brom went all out in buying Brown Ideye for £10million, breaking their own record transfer fee and telling the world they're deadly serious about not being sucked into a relegation battle. But plenty of questions have been asked since they bought the striker from Dynamo Kiev. Who is he? What's he done to be worth that kind of money? Will he adapt or just be another dud? Here, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on the 25-year-old from Nigeria. How did the £10m price-tag come about? Neuchatel Xamax to Sochaux - £4m . Sochaux to Dynamo Kiev - £7m . Dynamo Kiev to West Brom - £10m . At 25, Ideye's stock has risen over the years. The forward began with Ocean Boys, where he won the Nigerian Premier League, before venturing to Europe, as most aspiring youngsters would. The then-20-year-old joined Swiss outfit Neuchatel Xamax and, a failed trial at Dutch side Willem II Tilburg along the way, made it to Ligue 1 with Sochaux, costing about £4m at the time. He's upped his price as he goes along, particularly after joining Dynamo Kiev for £7m in 2011. There, he scored 33 goals in 74 games in the Ukrainian Premier League. Kiev wanted to make a profit on their initial investment, and have done so with the £10m sale. Signed: Brown Ideye has signed for West Brom for £10million from Dynamo Kiev as their fifth new player . BORN: Nigeria, October 10 1988 (age 25) 2006-2007: Ocean Boys (5 apps, 1 gl) 2008-2010: Neuchatel Xamax (55, 23) 2010-2011: Sochaux (52, 17) 2011-2014: Dynamo Kiev (74, 33) 2014-NOW: West Brom . 2010-NOW: Nigeria (23, 5) Statistics based on league appearances. Has he had his heart set on the Premier League for a while? Yes, but not with West Brom. The striker actually preferred Newcastle United. In 2013, he was rated at £9m and Swansea, West Ham and Stoke were others on the chase. But last year, his agent Hootan Ahmadi had this to say: 'There has been a lot of interest from English clubs, but Newcastle would be Brown's preferred choice for a number of reasons. 'They have a good fan-base and play an attacking style of football. 'He has a good knowledge of the club and of the Premier League. Brown would love to test himself at that level.' He's got the chance now, just not at St James' Park. Wanted: Dynamo Kiev striker Ideye attracted interest from several Premier League clubs at the time . How will he fit in? West Brom have been crying out for a powerful striker ever since Romelu Lukaku's loan spell came to an end, and they may find it in Ideye. He's strong, fast-paced, particularly good in the air, and has proved himself in the Champions League and internationally, too. The Baggies teetered above relegation to the Championship last year, and Saido Berahino and Stephane Sessegnon were their top goalscorers in a dismal Premier League campaign on five. If Ideye can adapt to England as he did to Ukraine, then he can be the goalscorer they crave. New boy: Ideye took to Twitter to announce the move and was excited to join the Premier League . Excited: Ideye wrote on Twitter that it was a 'done deal' and thanked God for the chance to join West Brom . Will he be a dud or a success? It's always difficult to judge, but there are no worrying signs to indicate that he will be anything other than a success at the Hawthorns. Some players instantly adapt to the Premier League, others take time, and a few never do. But Ideye seems a determined striker who's been waiting for this chance for a while. When he moved to Switzerland, he admitted he struggled with the cold weather. However, he became enough of a handful to defenders to earn a move to Ligue 1. West Brom have raised a few eyebrows with their spending on Ideye, but time will tell if it was too impulsive or a stroke of genius. Proud: Ideye took to Twitter to announce his deal with West Brom and thanked his family and agents .","Brown Ideye's stock has risen over his career to reach £10million price-tag .

"By . Chris Stocks . West Indies great Sir Viv Richards believes lifeless pitches around the world risk killing the appeal of Test cricket. Apart from the disappointing results, England’s summer has been notable for the benign wickets at Lord’s, Headingley and now Trent Bridge. New drainage systems have been given as one cause, the other being the desire of chief executives to make sure a Test lasts five days so as to recoup cash after having paid the England & Wales Cricket Board millions to host a match. Concern: Sir Viv Richards is worried that poor pitches could harm Test cricket . Richards is passionate about the issue, given that the problem has already affected the Caribbean significantly. Tests in the region are routinely played on dead pitches in front of pitiful crowds. Now Richards has warned England it is a pattern which could spread. ‘It’s a concern all around the world,’ he said. ‘Test cricket lost some its appeal a long time ago and Twenty20 competitions, like the Caribbean Premier League, have given the game a new lease of life. ‘It is up to the establishment to figure out how to make both formats work. We’ve all seen T20’s success but you also have that in the Ashes. We have to find a way to help preserve the longer version of the game.’ Ambassador: Richards, captain of West Indies in the 1980s, now works for the Caribbean Premier League . Richards, 62, who captained the great West Indies sides of the 1980s, was speaking as an ambassador for the Caribbean Premier League. The second edition of the franchise-based Twenty20 tournament started this weekend and this year’s big draw is England outcast Kevin Pietersen, who plays his first match for St Lucia Zouks on July 27. 'I’m very excited individuals of the stature of Kevin Pietersen are coming here,’ he said. 'He will be sorely missed by England. Why the [ECB] made the decision to shorten his Test career is none of my business, all I know is he is one of England’s best.

VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar greeted with hugs and kisses at Brazil training base . Friends reunited: Injured Neymar jokes around with his Brazilian teammates . Injury update: Brazilian stars such as David Luiz and Marcelo question Neymar over his injury . However it will take a lot to lift the mood of the fans. Some supporters inside the Estadio Mineirao burned a Brazilian flag and many left after 29 minutes on Tuesday night, when the hosts were 5-0 down. Those who remained booed their team off at half-time and then cheered and clapped the Germans in the second half as a sign of their disapproval towards the Selecao. Manager Luiz Felipe Scolari has called on his players to restore some pride to the nation by ending the World Cup with a victory. Brazil's hopes of winning the World Cup on home soil were dashed in the most brutal fashion on Tuesday when Germany ran out 7-1 winners. A wave of anger towards Scolari and his players followed the humiliation, but the Brazil coach rejected calls for him to resign. The defiant 65-year-old held up a sheet of paper during a press conference that followed the defeat, detailing his record of just three losses in 28 matches.

"By . Paul Collins . Dirk Kuyt is convinced that Louis van Gaal will be a resounding success at Manchester United. The 62-year-old will assume his position as Red Devils boss next week after taking charge of Holland in their World Cup third-place play-off against Brazil on Saturday. Van Gaal had hoped to sign off with a World Cup winner's medal around his neck, but those hopes were extinguished by Argentina, who beat the Dutch 4-2 in a penalty shootout at the Arena Corinthians on Wednesday. United we stand: Louis van Gaal will be a roaring success at Manchester United, says Dirk Kuyt . Holland failed to test the Argentina goalkeeper until the 98th minute, but Van Gaal should take credit for the way he kept Lionel Messi quiet in Sao Paulo. Manchester United's new manager also achieved a spectacular 5-1 win over reigning champions Spain in the group stages, so things are looking good for the 20-time English champions next year. 'There was only one thing for this coach - he just wanted to win this cup,' Kuyt said. 'That is the type of coach he is - he just wants to win things. 'He is desperate to be successful and I am sure he is going to be successful in his next job.' Any visitor to Holland's training ground in Rio de Janeiro during their stay at the World Cup will have been impressed by the relaxed and friendly mood in the camp. In action: Dirk Kuyt (right), tackling Lionel Messi, has faith in the new Old Trafford boss . The players laughed and joked during training; their families were welcome, as were the media. In the dressing room, Van Gaal has brought harmony too. 'The team spirit is amazing,' former Liverpool man Kuyt said. 'The coach was leading us and the 23 players were really important. 'Everyone played apart from (third-choice goalkeeper) Michel Vorm, and that says a lot about this team. 'We are not 11 players, we are 22 players and an enormous staff of 26 people and everyone played their part in this success.' Kuyt brands Holland's run to the last four a success, but there was still a huge feeling of disappointment as the players trudged off the pitch after Sergio Romero had saved from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder. Crunch time: Argentina's penalty hero was goalkeeper Sergio Romero, seding them through to the final . 'To lose on penalties is very hard,' the 33-year-old said. 'We were so close to reaching the final. 'Now it doesn't feel like a good achievement. But you look at the team, and the young players we have. 'Five or six of those players today are in the Dutch league and are in the semi-final of the World Cup. We can be very proud of the team. 'We believed in ourselves and surprised many people. We had a lot of critics in the beginning but beat some very good teams, and against Argentina we defended like lions.' The pain of exiting the tournament was enhanced by the fact that Argentina were far from at their peak in Sao Paulo. Alejandro Sabella's team only registered two shots on target in normal time, and Messi floundered after being man-marked by Nigel de Jong. Slammed: Kuyt, battling Rodrigo Palacio, was not impressed with Argentina . 'I don't think we were impressed by them,' Kuyt said bluntly. 'If you watch the game defensively, our defence was playing against Messi, (Sergio) Aguero, (Gonzalo) Higuain and more players who are at the top of the game. 'In attack we wanted to give some harder times to them but they had two defensive lines of four.' Much to Van Gaal's dismay, Holland must now play Brazil on Saturday for the dubious honour of finishing third, rather than fourth. Kuyt did not sound too enthused by the prospect of a third-place play-off either, but he would still like to end the summer with a win. He added: 'We did so well. We came so far that it would be a shame to go home with two losing games.'","Former Liverpool star convinced Van Gaal will be a success at Man United .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail Online . Residents of a tiny village in Ohio are up in arms after they say a game warden shot and killed a tame deer in front of children who had befriended the animal. People in Clarington - population 384 - said the deer has become known in the area for its friendly demeanor, allowing children and adults to pet it and pose for pictures with it. But an officer with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources was determined to shoot the creature citing the unpredictable nature of wild animals, especially during mating season. Scroll down for video . Poor deer: This friendly fawn was shot dead by an Ohio wildlife officer because it was deemed a public safety hazard . Friendly fawn: The young buck showed up in the Clarington area a few months ago and proved itself to be very friendly, allowing kids and adults to pet him . According to Clarington Mayor Droug Wagner, the wildlife agency learned of the tame deer from a local resident who complained about the animal eating out of his garden. The deer was first spotted in the area several months ago wearing a collar around its neck, Martins Ferry Times Leader reported. The fawn was described as being comfortable around children and adults alike. The wildlife officer who was put on the case spent days stalking the deer, and on Monday he arrived in Clarington with the intention to shoot the critter. But his plan was foiled by the presence of angry residents who came to the deer’s defense. On Wednesday, Shannon Lee and her two daughters were sitting on their porch when they heard a gunshot. Mrs Lee said it took the ODNR officer about 30 minutes to corner the deer before he was able to kill the animal within earshot of her daughter, Olivia, who took a liking to the friendly creature. Traumatic experience: Shannon Lee and her two daughters were sitting on their porch Wednesday when a wildlife officer shot the deer without giving them a warning . 'i petted it, and i would feed it, and i would play with it some more, and it was my best friend,’ the little girl told the station WTRF. The girl’s mother expressed anger that the officer with the state agency failed to warn her and other parents about what was to come. Heartbroken: Olivia Lee said she used to feed and play with the tame young deer, which she descrbied as her best friend . ‘They saw us sitting on the porch, they didn't tell us, “Can you please take the kids inside...” [there was] no warning at all until we heard the gunshot,’ Shannon Lee said. According to Tim Parrett, district manager with the ODNR, the deer had to be put down because it was a public safety hazard. ‘Everyone understands the curiosity and the value of wildlife, with this opportunity to touch it, but people don't realize this is still a wild animal, and they're unpredictable,’ Parrett explained. ‘Especially a buck with antlers, all it has to do is flick its head and it can seriously injure a child or adult. The potential for danger is there.’ Parrett added that it would have been irresponsible not to kill the deer. Some concerned residents have called on the wildlife agency to relocate the friendly buck, but Parrett said that if the deer was ill with chronic wasting disease - a degenerative condition affecting the brain - it could have spread it to other animals. The manager added that the deer's friendly behavior was abnormal and a possible indicator that the animal was ill. Justification: State wildlife officials said shooting the animal was the only responsible thing to do because it may have been sick .

She was also the only broadcast journalist allowed to remain on Air Force One with George W. Bush in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Compton's career began in Virginia, where she got a job in Roanoke at a local CBS affiliate after an internship during college. Iconoclast: Compton spent 41 years at ABC News and covered 7 presidencies, including that of George W. Bush, when she was the only broadcast reporter allowed to stay on Air Force One after the September 11 attacks . ABC News plucked her out of Virginia and hired her to work in the company's New York offices in 1973 before sending her to the White House in 1974. Her list of awards and accolades was capped off by a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Washington Press Club given to her earlier this year. Compton will take one last trip overseas when President Obama travels to the NATO summit in Wales before retiring on September 10.","Ann Compton will retire on the 41st anniversary of joining ABC News .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail Online . Federal case: Jason Turk, 37, a real estate agent from Florida, has filed a lawsuit accusing Tampa police of violating his constitutional rights during a January incident when an officer shot him in the face as he sat in his car contemplating suicide . A Florida real estate agent and Navy veteran who was shot in the face earlier this year after his wife called 911 to report that he was suicidal has filed a federal lawsuit against Tampa and the responding officer. Jason Turk, 37, and his wife, Amanda, claimed that the city failed to properly train Tampa police officers in crisis intervention. The lawsuit filed Tuesday also alleges that K-9 officer Tim Bergman used excessive force when he fired twice on Turk as he was sitting in his BMW outside him home in January with a gun in his hand. At around 4am on January 9, Amanda Turk dialled 911 to report that her severely depressed husband was possibly suicidal. Mrs Turk told the emergency operator that Jason didn't have the nerve to pull the trigger himself, but was aware that if police arrive and he refused to put his gun down, they will shoot him. The police department classified the call as 'suicide by cop.' According to the federal lawsuit filed by the Turks claiming violation of Jason’s Fourth Amendment rights, Amanda never mentioned that her husband wanted an officer to kill him. News10 reported that of the 19 officers who responded to the scene on Peninsular Street that night, none received training on how to deal with people suffering from mental illness. Mental health issue:Turk, an 11-year Navy veteran pictured here standing next to former first lady Laura Bush, said he was depressed and only posed a threat to himself on January 9 . Troubled couple: Amanda Turk, pictured left and right, called 911 telling them that her then-estranged husband had a gun and was was possibly suicidal . After the responding officers attempted to remove Turk from his car, the man allegedly waved his gun at them – a claim that Jason has disputed. That is when K-9 officer Tim Bergman fired two shots, striking Turk in the face. Jason Turk was rushed to St Joseph's Hospital where he had to undergo surgery. During an investigation into the shooting, officer Bergman said that Turk raised his gun, but the 11-year U.S. Navy veteran insisted that he kept his weapon down. Disturbing: After the shooting, Turk took a photo of his disfigured face with the caption: 'It's over!' The couple's attorney, Michael Maddux, said the shooting was unjustified. The lawsuit claims Turk, pictured bottom right with President George W. Bush, was in need of a crisis intervention specialist, but none of the responding officers received the proper training . Jason Turk, who has a young daughter, . said that if he posed a threat to anyone that night, it was to himself . alone, and that what he needed was a trained crisis intervention officer . who could de-escalate the situation instead of shooting him in the . face. The shooting was ruled justified by the Hillsborough County State Attorney, Bay News 9 reported. The lawsuit states that Turk and his wife hit a rough patch in their marriage back in 2013. That year, Jason was also struck by a car while out biking. The man had been suffering from severe depression, which resulted in Turk being committed two months before the January 9 suicide attempt, according to The Tampa Tribune. On the night of the incident, Turk videotaped himself reading aloud his suicide note and sent it to his then-estranged wife, who called 911. After the shooting, Turk took a selfie of his disfigured face and sent it to Amanda with the caption: 'It’s over!’ ‘Skilled intervention, not force, was the order of the day for a successful, constitutional conclusion,’ the couple’s federal lawsuit stated.","Jason Turk, 37, real estate agent and 11-year Navy veteran, was shot by Officer Tim Bergman during alleged suicide attempt January 9 .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail Online . A father and his two sons landed behind bars on drunken driving charges in connection to a single car accident in Vermont over the weekend. Nicholas Woodward, 19, his 22-year-old brother, Joshua, and their father, 46-year-old Brian Woodward, all from Fairfax, were arrested Saturday in Fletcher on their way home from a fishing trip. For the youngest of the Woodward trio, the arrest marked the second DUI incident in as many weeks. His older brother, Joshua Woodward, is also facing a count of driving on a suspended license. All in the family: Joshua Woodward, 22 (left), his 19-year-old brother Nicholas (right), and their father Brian Woodward have been charged with DUI in Vermont in connection to a one-car rollover crash . According to police in Vermont, it all started just before 8pm Saturday when a warden with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife came upon an overturned vehicle on Cambridge Road. Officers who arrived on the scene determined that Joshua Woodward was behind the wheel at the time of the rollover, and that his blood alcohol level was nearly three times the state’s legal limit. As the 22-year-old was being evaluated by paramedics on the scene, police said his 19-year-old brother, Nicholas, pulled over at the site of the wreck in his own vehicle to check up on his sibling. Repeat offense: The 19-year-old Nicholas Woodward was cited for another DUI incident two week before the rollover . Brian Woodward, who was a passenger in Nicholas' truck, then got behind the wheel to move the vehicle closer to Joshua's wreckage. The Fish and Wildlife game warden, who was still at the scene, noticed that Brian Woodward appeared inebriated and ordered him to stop the truck and get out, according to police. State troopers noted that the 46-year-old man reeked of alcohol and appeared impaired. A breath test confirmed that Mr Woodward also had a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. While the father of two was being handcuffed, troopers noticed that Nicholas Woodward, who is underage, also appeared to have been drinking alcohol that night. Field sobriety tests and the teen’s preliminary breath sample confirmed that he was driving under the influence, police said. The teen was cited for DUI - his second in two weeks. He is due back in court August 18, while his brother and father are set to appear before a judge September 2.","Nicholas Woodward, 19, brother Joshua, 22, and their father Brian Woodward, 46, charged with DUIs in a single car crash in Vermont .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A taxi driver hit speeds of up to 100mph as he took two women on a hair-raising journey after they got in his car on their way to a nightclub. Hayleigh Sillars and Lisa Archibald experienced a terrifying ride after they were picked up from Miss Archibald's house in Alloa, Clackmannanshire, by driver John Krenski in December last year. Miss Sillars described how Krenski overtook cars at more than 90mph on dark, wet roads with 60mph speed limits as he took her and her friend to a popular nightspot eight miles away in Stirling. Night out: Hayleigh Sillars, pictured left in the hat, and Lisa Archibald posed for a selfie (left) in the back of a police car after the officers who pulled over a speeding Krenski, right, offered to take them to their destination . Their ordeal ended when Krenski was pulled over by police, who said the 61-year-old was driving so fast the police car struggled to keep up. The officers then gave the two women a lift to the nightclub - after lending them their hats for some backseat selfies. Speaking at Stirling Sheriff Court, Miss Sillars said: 'I got in the car at Lisa’s house and at first everything seemed fine. 'I had concerns when he started really picking up speed on the 60mph road. He was going about 90-100mph at least. 'It was fast. We were both pretty scared. I remember Lisa pointing at the speedometer and we both saw what speed he was doing. It was between 90 and 95mph.' Miss . Sillars said the driver overtook cars on the main road between Alloa . and Stirling and also on a road in Stirling heading towards Morrisons . supermarket. Miss Sillars said had seen no cars heading towards them when the driver . was overtaking but two police witnesses both told the court Krenski . overtook into oncoming traffic. Ordeal: Miss Sillars' ordeal ended when Krenski was pulled over by police, who said the 61-year-old was driving so fast the police car struggled to keep up. She said that she had seen Krenski overtake cars at speed . She said: 'He overtook two or three cars when he was heading towards Morrisons. That’s when we saw the speedometer at 90mph. His driving was erratic when he was overtaking.' Their journey was brought to a stop when Krenski was pulled over by the police, who spotted Krenski speeding as he crossed the busy Blackgrange Roundabout on the A907 at around 10pm on 20 December. Special Constable Michael Robertson said: 'We observed the vehicle overtaking four vehicles into oncoming traffic. We had to travel in excess of 90mph to catch up with the vehicle. 'The oncoming traffic was forced to take evasive action. They were observed to pull into the near side to let him past.' His colleague Police Constable David Reid said Krenski was driving his car 'as fast as it could go'. Happy ending: The Facebook posts that Miss Sillards put out on the night Krenski was pulled over, telling her friends about her and Miss Archibald's ride in a police car to the Stirling nightclub . He added: 'I was driving my police vehicle at its limits to keep up with him.' When they did catch up with Krenski, he said the reason he was speeding was because he was 'late to pick up his next fare'. After pulling the car over, the police gave Miss Sillars and Miss Archibald a lift to Stirling nightspot Fubar and let them take a photo in the back seat. Miss Sillars posted the selfie on her Facebook, explaining that the officers had given them their hats to pose with. She wrote: 'Stuck in the back of a taxi which apparently isn’t a taxi.

She later added: 'Hahaha yes police men gave us a lift and gave us their hats to take selfies.' First-time offender Krenski, from Alloa, gave evidence in his . defence and claimed he was being 'picked on' by the police. He denied driving dangerously at speeds of more than 90mph and overtaking . cars forcing them to take evasive action, driving without a taxi . licence, and having defects on his vehicle, but he was found guilty of all . charges after a trial at Stirling Sheriff Court.

Two Amish girls who sparked a massive search after being kidnapped from their family's roadside produce stand in northern New York last night have been found unharmed. Six-year-old Delila Miller and 12-year-old Fannie Miller were bundled into a white car as they went to help a customer in Oswegatchie around 7.20pm Wednesday, according to reports. About 24 hours later, the children were reunited with their parents, according to a law enforcement source. St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Raintold said the sisters 'seem to be healthy,' but were 'cold and wet.' 7News reported that the children were snatched by two men who took them to a house near Richville and left them there, ordering them not to go anywhere. But Fannie and Delila ran away and sought help. The two girls came by the house of Jeff Stinson, who recognized Fannie and Delila as the kidnapped children and took them to their parents. Earlier today, the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office released a drawing of what Fannie looks like. Members of the Amish community do not allow photos of themselves, which they see as an act of pride and a violation of their religious beliefs. Kevin Wells has said his office had received 'numerous leads' and that state troopers, forest rangers and U.S. Border Patrol agents were part of the search.

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Faye Stone, 54, outside Chelmsford Crown Court today. She waited a week after she found her lodger's body before she told police about the death . A landlady left her dead lodger lying in his room for more than a week because she wanted to 'tidy up' before reporting his death. Faye Stone, 54, waited a week before telling police about the death of Terry Brett, 60, after she discovered him dead on his bed in the house they shared in Elsenham, Essex, last year. She said that her chronic fatigue syndrome rendered her unable to tidy up his belongings, which she said she needed to do before officers could enter the property. Stone, who pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful . burial of Mr Brett, was given a six month jail . sentence suspended for two years with 12 months supervision at Chelmsford Crown Court today. The 54-year-old, from Essex, was understood to have had 'some form of relationship' with Mr Brett, who moved in to her house two months before his death in June last year. The court heard that Stone was a friend of Mr Brett for several years before he contacted her about becoming her lodger. Stone's Counsel, Peter Barlex, told the court: 'He was out . of work, short of money and had health problems. 'He moved in during . April and she had helped him with his shopping and given him a lift to . the station.' He explained that when Stone returned from visiting her mother, she entered Mr Brett's bedroom and found his body on the bed. The court heard how he died of a drug overdose. The exact date of Mr Brett's death is not known. Mr Barlex said that she was 'distressed' because her chronic fatigue syndrome meant 'she couldn't tidy up for the authorities to gain access'. He said: 'She remained in that property and is . remorseful. She knows she should have contacted the police much earlier, . it was a reaction to finding his corpse in his bedroom.' Sentencing, Judge Patricia . Lynch QC said: 'This is a serious matter and a very unpleasant offence but you didn't really understand how serious the offence was and how relatives, if he had them, felt about him lying there several days more than he could have.' Referring to Stone's explanation of chronic fatigue, Judge Lynch continued: 'On the face of it strikes as fanciful. But I can give it some credibility because of her condition. The court heard how Stone returned from visiting her mother to find Mr Brett dead on his bed in the home they shared in Elsenham, Essex, pictured. She blamed the delay in her reporting on her chronic fatigue syndrome . 'We're talking about a week at the absolute most and there are no aggravating features.' Stone, who the court heard was of previous good character, had admitted preventing the lawful and decent burial of Mr Brett's body between 13 and 21 June last year. Prosecutor Richard Stevens said Mr Brett had been there 'a week or so' before she reported his death to the police. He continued: 'She contacted police about midnight on 21 June and later said she had done so at night because she didn't want the neighbours to know exactly what was going on.'

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail Online . and Associated Press . Nearly three years after Katie Breland was told by doctors that she will never walk again following a devastating car wreck, the determined Louisiana fitness instructor is getting ready to prove everyone wrong by taking her first steps down the aisle on the day of her wedding. In October 2011, during a drive toward Franklinton where she worked, Breland missed a stop sign that was turned sideways. A truck hit her Nissan broadside. She flew through the windshield and across the road, landing in a ditch. Her car landed on top of her. It took an emergency crew 33 minutes to extract her from beneath the engine. Scroll down for video . In the blink of an eye: Katie Breland pictured left before her 2011 accident, and right in a hospital bed after the crash that left her paralyzed from the waist down . Wreckage: Breland missed a stop sign on her way to work and her Nissan was broadsided by a truck . Severe burns covered three-quarters of her body. Two vertebrae were shattered, leaving her paralyzed from the waist down. Breland was in the hospital for 100 days and had many surgeries, including skin grafts and a surgery where rods and plates were placed to hold her back together. Speaking to WGNO this week, Breland recalled that when she was airlifted to University Hospital in New Orleans, a doctor came into her room and said that her spinal cord had been severed and she will never walk again. But the strong, athletic young woman who has spent most of her life playing sports and working out was determined to regain use of her legs. ‘So many people that are in wheelchairs are content with being in wheelchairs because somebody told them the prognosis was that they would always be in a wheelchair. You can’t be content being in it,’ said Breland. Bad news: Breland suffered severe burns and was told that she will never walk again . Survivor: Katie Breland, a lifelong athlete and fitness fanatic, has been competing in triathlons in a wheelchair (left), while her leg braces (right) allow her to walk and drive a car . Unbreakable: Katie, who has long worked as a personal trainer, opened her own gym, Katie's Shed . At first, Breland couldn’t hold her head up. She has since competed in her first triathlon. She can drive and walk on her braces and is much more independent. Breland has been making regular trips to Mike Barwis’ training center in Michigan, where she has been learning different workouts. When she started her physical therapy she had braces from her chest down. The ones she wears now start just above the knee. And she’s been able to walk about 200 yards in those braces, just holding someone’s hands. In May, Discovery Channel aired a reality show titled American Muscle about the Michigan center called Barwis Methods. Breland was among those featured in the program. Last December, Katie Breland got engaged to programmer Odie Hughes, whom she met three months earlier. She is currently planning their September wedding, and wants to walk down the aisle. Practicing for that has been a major focus this summer. On her wedding day, Katie said she will walk down the aisle flanked by her father and Mike Barwis who helped her power through the pain and go beyond her physical limitations. True love: Last December, Katie Breland got engaged to Odie Hughes, whom she met three months earlier, and the couple are planning a September wedding . Special goal: Katie has been training with her coach for months so she could take her first steps when she walks down the aisle next month . Before her accident, Breland played basketball and had run in hundreds of races, so she knew people were watching to see how she would cope and move forward after the accident. She knew she had to prove to herself and others that she could still do things she used to do. That’s how she got started with triathlon training, and she has participated in several races, most recently last month. She races using a specially designed bicycle and hopes to beat her time from last year. Inspirational: Breland is hoping that other young women facing health conditions similar to hers will hear her story and work to overcome their physical limitations . Breland graduated from Ben’s Ford in 2005 then completed the physical therapy program at Pearl River Community College. For about six years she has worked as a therapist at Therapeutic Concepts in Bogalusa, and she recently opened her own gym, Katie’s Shed. A personal trainer, Breland holds classes there several evenings each week and also works individually with clients. When she’s not helping someone else train, she’s working out herself. Breland said she is thankful for the support she’s received from the Bogalusa community, with countless people following her progress and participating in fundraisers and events for her. She said she knew from the time of her wreck that she wanted to make the best she possibly could of the situation. About a year ago she decided she was ready to share her story, and since that time she has had several speaking engagements each month. Though there is a constant battle of knowing there are things she is not yet able to do, Breland said the wreck has changed her life in good ways, too. ‘It’s humbled me. It’s made me see things through completely different eyes,’ she said. She said she saw how quickly things can change and she doesn’t take much for granted anymore, and she values time with friends and family.","Katie Breland, of Louisiana, suffered critical injuries in October 2011 car wreck .

"By . Pat Hagan . If you treated yourself to a lie-in this morning, pat yourself on the back. For not only will sleeping in at the weekend help you feel more relaxed, it also makes you slimmer. Researchers have discovered that extra sleep is the key to beating hunger pangs and staving off cravings for fatty food. Stay sleeping a little longer: A study in Chicago found an extra 90 minutes in bed could suppress appetite . Even just 90 minutes extra in bed makes a difference. A study of overweight young adults found that those who went to bed earlier or stayed in bed for longer experienced a 14 per cent drop in their appetite and a 62 per cent decline in their desire for unhealthy salty or sweet snacks. The findings suggest simple changes to bedtimes could help to combat the UK’s obesity epidemic. Previous studies have shown that too little sleep can lead to weight problems, partly because it disrupts the hormone balance which helps to keep appetite in check. But scientists from the University of Chicago wanted to see if a simple adjustment to sleeping patterns could bring about rapid changes in food cravings and eating habits. They studied ten overweight or obese men and women aged between 21 and 40 who slept an average of six and a half hours or less a night. For the first week, they were told to carry on with their normal sleeping  patterns, during which time they were quizzed on how hungry they felt and what foods they yearned for. Crucial: Scientists say the key to suppressing appetite is Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REMS) In the second week, they were told to extend their time in bed to between eight and eight and a half hours. Each one was given a wrist monitor to record when they got out of bed and kept a daily log of their sleeping patterns. The results, published in the journal Appetite, showed that by increasing their time in bed by just 90 minutes, the overweight volunteers drastically reduced their appetite – in particular their desire to scoff unhealthy snacks. Professor Jim Horne, former head of sleep research at Loughborough University in Leicestershire, said more time in bed appears to curb appetite by directly affecting the brain, not just by preventing people from eating. He said the secret is the amount of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep, or REMS, which is when the brain switches into dream mode. ‘If you sleep longer you have more REM sleep and that has appetite suppressant properties,’ he added.","Researchers from University of Chicago studied 10 overweight people .

"By . Pat Hagan . Taking digoxin daily could reduce a man's risk of prostate cancer by 50 per cent . A drug that costs little more than £1 a month could reduce a man's chances of developing prostate cancer by half, new research shows. The drug, called digoxin, is already widely used to treat thousands of patients with heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. It is made from chemicals originally derived from foxgloves, one of Britain's best-known flowering plants. The latest breakthrough, by scientists in the U.S., suggests men who take the drug every day may be much less likely to develop a prostate tumour. It's thought that digoxin stops prostate cancer cells from growing by lowering levels of a protein called HIF-1. This protein is vital for malignant cells to flourish because it controls the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumour with the oxygen and nutrients it needs to survive. The findings, published in the journal The Prostate, are in line with a 2011 study which found the same drug appeared to have a powerful effect on breast cancer - also by blocking the effects of the HIF-1 protein. It could mean the drug, for which nearly five million NHS prescriptions are issued every year, could one day be used alongside other treatments in the early stages of cancer. Nearly 40,000 cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK and 10,000 men die from it - the equivalent of more than one an hour. The risks increase with age, with men over 50 more likely to develop a tumour, and there is a strong genetic element to it. In a bid to find new ways of beating the disease, scientists have been exploring the powers of existing drugs - such as digoxin - that are already used for other diseases and are therefore cheap and readily available. In 1785, country doctor William Withering noticed a remarkable improvement in a patient with congestive heart failure after they took a traditional herbal remedy made from foxglove. He identified that the active ingredient was a substance called digitalis and wrote about his findings more than 200 years ago in a book entitled 'An account of the foxglove and some of its medical uses'. Digoxin stops tumours growing as it lowers the levels of a protein which is vital for tumours to flourish. The protein controls the growth of blood vessels that feed the tumour. Image shows prostate cancer cells . Drug company giants like GlaxoSmithKline eventually turned it into a tablet called digoxin, used for heart failure as well as atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm that increases the risk of stroke. It has been used for decades on the NHS and has been taken by millions of patients with heart defects -costing around £1.30 for a 28-day supply. Now the hope is it could tackle cancer too. However, the drug can have side effects such as nausea, headaches and breast enlargement in men and has even been linked with an increased risk of death from cardiac conditions in some people. Digoxin is made from chemicals originally derived from foxgloves, one of Britain's best-known flowering plants . It's unlikely to be given to healthy men to prevent tumours but could be used alongside other treatments when cancer has first been diagnosed. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre, both in Seattle, looked at just over 1,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2002 and 2005. They studied health records to see how many had been taking digoxin for heart conditions before they fell ill with cancer and compared the results with a similar-sized group of cancer-free men from the area. The results showed that men on the drug were between 42 per cent and 56 per cent less likely to develop a prostate tumour, even when researchers allowed for other factors that might increase the risks - such as having a family history of the disease. Their results also match those from a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who in 2011 found digoxin appeared to stop the growth of prostate cancer in nearly one in four men. In a report on the latest data researchers said: 'These findings support the growing evidence that digoxin has potential anti-tumour activity. Larger studies are warranted to evaluate the potential role of the drug in relation to prostate cancer development and progression.' Cancer Research UK said it was too early to say if the drug could be used to prevent prostate cancer and stressed the numbers involved in the study were small. Health information officer Dr Indi Ghangrekar said: 'If men are worried about their risk of prostate cancer, or notice any unusual or persistent bodily changes, like difficulty passing urine or needing to urinate more often, they should talk to a doctor.'","Digoxin is currently used by the NHS to treat heart failure .

"By . Pat Hagan . Discovery: A common treatment for heavy snorers also has a powerful effect on their performance on the golf course, scientists have found . Forget hours of practice and spending a fortune on the very best clubs. The real secret to getting better at golf may be found in the bedroom – just not in the way men might hope for. Scientists have found that a common treatment for heavy snorers which involves wearing a mask at night also has a powerful effect on their performance on the golf course. Men who underwent the therapy – known as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP – significantly improved their driving and putting abilities. Some were able to reduce their handicap – a measure of how many shots it takes them to complete an 18-hole round – by nearly a third. The reason, researchers suspect, is that better quality sleep and fewer night-time interruptions mean golfers’ brains are more alert and they are better able to concentrate on the game. CPAP is widely used to treat the snoring-related condition called sleep apnoea. Around three million people in Britain suffer with it, with one in four men and one in ten women affected. As sleep begins, the muscles in the airways relax and drop down towards the tongue. For most people this does not pose a problem but in sleep apnoea, it leads to a complete collapse which shuts off breathing for at least ten seconds. Air vibrates against the soft tissue that stands in its way, causing the characteristic ‘rasping’ sound that snorers make. Once the brain realises breathing has stopped it sends out a signal for the airway muscles to contract again. Benefits: Snorers who underwent the therapy - known as Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, or CPAP - significantly improved their driving and putting abilities (file picture) This opens the airway and the sufferer normally wakes with a jolt. In mild sleep apnoea, this can happen about once every ten minutes. If it’s severe, it means sleep can be disturbed every couple of minutes. As well as feeling drowsy in the day, sufferers may also be at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes if they do not seek treatment. One recent study found heavy snorers with broken sleep were twice as likely to be hit by a potentially life-threatening stroke as men who do not snore. CPAP involves donning a mask that is hooked up to a bedside machine which pumps pressurised air into the nose and mouth. This constant supply of pressurised air helps to keep the airways open. Treatment: CPAP involves donning a mask that is hooked up to a bedside machine which pumps pressurised air into the nose and mouth. This constant supply of pressurised air helps keep the airways open (file picture) Sleep specialists at the Morristown Medical Centre in Morristown, New Jersey, wanted to see what affect the therapy had on golfing prowess because it requires high levels of concentration and co-ordination. They recruited 12 male golfers with sleep apnoea and compared them to a similar group that did not snore at night. Each volunteer had their golf handicap calculated before the experiment. Over the next few weeks, the heavy snorers had nightly CPAP treatment, while the non-snorers slept peacefully as normal. During that time, the recruits played at least 20 rounds of golf and, at the end of the trial, their handicap was recalculated. The results, published in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, showed healthy sleepers who had no CPAP treatment saw little or no improvement in their handicap. But heavy snorers who wore the masks every night saw an average 11.3 per cent drop in theirs, with the most skilled golfers chipping more than 31 per cent off their score cards. In a report on their findings the researchers said: ‘Golf is a sport that requires a range of cognitive skills. Treatment of sleep apnoea with continuous positive airway pressure enhanced performance in golfers with the condition.’ Professor Jim Horne from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University said increased daytime alertness is probably the key to improved golf. He said: ‘These men would be less sleepy with CPAP and more able to concentrate. ‘But it’s also possible that there was a placebo effect – whereby the men getting the treatment played better simply because they expected their performance to improve.’","Heavy snorers treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)

"By . Pat Hagan . Being overweight can increase your risk of going deaf, researchers found. A 20-year study of nearly 70,000 women found those who gained the most weight were more likely to lose their hearing. And although the study focused on women, the findings apply equally to men, the researchers said. Until now, it was thought the only way to slow age-related deafness was to protect the ears against loud noise. But the study also found that regular physical activity – such as walking at least two hours a week – could reduce the risk of hearing loss by around 15 per cent. The study of 70,000 women found those who had put on more weight were more likely to lose their hearing. The findings are also applicable to men say researchers . The findings come from the Nurses Health . Study, one of the biggest health research projects ever undertaken, . which has been tracking the well-being of thousands of female nurses in . the US since the 1980s. Every two years for two decades the . nurses were quizzed on health and lifestyle, including their dietary . habits, weight and hearing loss. Researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston found that very overweight women with a body mass index (a measure of whether weight is healthy in relation to height) of 40 or higher were 25 per cent more likely to have damaged hearing than women with a healthy BMI of 25 or lower. And women with waists bigger than 34.5in were 27 per cent per cent more likely to be hard of hearing than those with waistlines of less than 28in. The risks of obesity were evident even when researchers took account of other factors known to affect hearing, such as smoking. It’s not clear exactly how being overweight damages delicate cells in the ear. The study found women with a BMI of over 40 were more likely to suffer damaged hearing. File image . But the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Medicine, suggested fatty deposits could clog up blood vessels in the ear, limiting blood supply and therefore damaging cells. A US study in the early nineties found . elderly men and women with hearing loss were up to three times more . likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke than those whose hearing was . still good. Lead researcher Dr Sharon Curhan said: ‘The ear is highly . metabolically active, so that means it’s really dependent on having . adequate blood supply.’ She said obesity can compromise blood flow by . narrowing blood vessels. People who are obese also are more likely to . have high blood pressure, another condition that can hamper blood flow. Around ten million people in the UK suffer some degree of hearing loss and, as we all live longer, that figure is expected to rise to 14.5 million in the next 20 years. The vast majority of cases are due to the ageing process, where tiny hair cells in the inner ear die off and are not replaced. High-pitched sounds, such as a bird chirping or a phone ringing, are usually the first to go. According to the charity Action on Hearing Loss, most people put up with deteriorating hearing for around ten years before having it tested or seeking help. Action on Hearing Loss said it is due to publish its own research within the next few months exploring the links between dietary habits, smoking and loss of hearing.","Study found women who gained most weight were more likely to lose hearing .

"By . Pat Hagan . Heavy snorers are twice as likely to suffer a deadly stroke as those who sleep peacefully, research shows. A major study of more than 25,000 people found the risk of a fatal blood clot more than doubled if someone snored through the night. They were also 80 per cent more likely to have heart disease, researchers found.

But in more severe cases, it means sleep can be disturbed every couple of minutes. Treatment usually involves sleeping with a mask that pumps air into the throat. But tens of thousands of sufferers are thought to go untreated, and the latest study suggests that the dangers to the heart and brain are greater than doctors thought. Scientists from Shandong University in China came up with their findings after pooling data from 12 earlier studies. The results showed strokes were twice as likely in heavy snorers, but mild snorers faced no increased risk. Scientists think that the problem stems from the blood flow to the heart and brain being affected by constant breathing interruptions. But it may also be due to the fact that heart rate and blood pressure are repeatedly jolted out of their naturally lower state during deep sleep. Strokes hit 150,000 people every year, with 30,000 being fatal. Only cancer and heart disease kill more people. The researchers said: ‘Patients with sleep apnoea will be at higher risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and death.’ Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘If you think you may have the condition, have a chat to your doctor. 'For many people, it is linked to risk factors for your heart, such as obesity. ‘So it’s likely your doctor will help you think about lifestyle changes to improve the condition, such as making sure you take regular exercise.’","Scientists from Shandong University in China came up with the findings .

"By . Pat Hagan . An extra glass of water could be the secret to halting an expanding waistline . Forget fad diets and punishing exercise routines – the cure to middle-age spread may literally be on tap. Scientists at Harvard say that drinking just one extra glass of water a day could be the secret to halting an expanding waistline. The study found that over a 20-year period, adults in their thirties, forties and fifties gained nearly half a stone less simply by replacing one sugar-sweetened drink with a glass of water. The research, carried out by a team . from the Harvard School of Public Health, is one of the most . comprehensive investigations into the long-term dietary benefits of . drinking water instead of calorie-loaded fizzy drinks or fruit juices. It involved tracking the food and drink consumption of nearly 125,000 people over several decades. The team looked at adults who took part in three long-term studies carried out in the US from the mid-eighties up to 2007. Researchers . analysed changes in their eating and drinking habits as well as their . weight gain on a regular basis over more than two decades. The results, published in the International Journal of Obesity, showed that every four years the men and women in the study gained an average of 1.5 kilos – which works out as more than three pounds. This meant that, over the 20 or so years they were studied, they put on well over a stone as middle age took its toll. But if they had replaced just one sugary drink with water every day, then they reduced their total weight gain by around five to seven pounds. An extra two cups a day meant that over the 20 years they gained nearly a stone less than those who chose sugary drinks or even fruit juices. And the results showed tea and coffee without sugar were almost as good as plain water – as the unsweetened hot drinks also had a significant impact on gradual weight gain among thousands of middle-aged men and women. The research was carried out by a team from the Harvard School of Public Health and is one of the most comprehensive into the long term benefits of replacing fizzy drinks with water . In a report on their findings the scientists said: ‘Substitution of sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices by water and other drinks was significantly associated with less weight gain over time. These findings support current recommendations to increase consumption of water for the prevention of obesity.’ Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George’s Hospital, London, said: ‘This is a massive study with very interesting findings. ‘It confirms that low-calorie drinks like water are highly effective when you want to keep your weight in check.’ Previous studies have suggested that sipping water stops people piling on the pounds by curbing their appetite. For example, downing a glass 30 minutes before eating has been shown to reduce calorie intake during a meal. And scientists at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands found drinking six to eight glasses a day can also reduce the intensity and the duration of severe headaches.","Over a 20-year period adults in their thirties, forties and fifties gained nearly half a stone less by replacing one fizzy drink with a glass of water .

"By . Pat Hagan . Your shopping list doesn’t just save time at the supermarket – it also helps keep you slim. Writing a detailed list of groceries needed can contribute to weight loss by steering shoppers away from fattening temptations, researchers have found. Their study concluded those who wrote a list were more likely to lose weight than those who didn’t. Study leader Dr Nicole Au of Monash University in Melbourne, Australia said: ‘Many consumers know all too well . that over-eating and under-exercising will lead to weight gain and . increased risk of chronic illness. People who write a shopping list are more likely to lose weight than those who don't, according to a new study in Melbourne, Australia . ‘But impulsiveness or poor self-control leads people to behave in a manner that departs from their good intentions. ‘Our . findings provide evidence that shopping to a list is likely to be a . cost-effective means through which the NHS could reduce obesity and its . related illnesses.’ Obesity has emerged as a major burden on the NHS and the ready availability of fattening foods makes it hard to resist hunger pangs when they strike during the day. Writing a detailed list of groceries can contribute to weight loss by steering shoppers away from fattening temptations, it is claimed . Recent figures showed the number of people admitted to hospital for obesity-related illnesses has shot up by more than 10 times in the past decade. Health experts predict Britain’s obesity epidemic will cost the NHS and the economy £60bn annually by 2050. Yet two out of five dieters quit within the first seven days and nearly 65 per cent return to their pre-weight diet within three years of starting to watch what they eat. The new study, published in the journal Nutrition and Diabetes, looked at 163 overweight women. All the women were given standard advice on diet and exercise but half were also provided with detailed meal plans and shopping lists that they had to stick to. Over the next six months, the women with shopping lists lost an average of around 12 kilogrammes – or just under two stones. The rest lost an average of just eight kilos – or one stone three pounds. However, buying groceries online – rather than browsing in supermarkets – did not have the same positive effect. Shoppers were still likely to impulse buy from their home computer. British experts said last night writing a shopping list signifies a degree of commitment that can help to ward off impulse buying. ‘It means you have already put in the mental effort before you even leave the house,’ said psychologist Paul Buckley, from Cardiff Metropolitan University. ‘Supermarkets would much prefer that you did all your thinking once you get there so that you’re more open to persuasion and end up spending more.’","People who write a shopping list are more likely to lose weight than those who don't, according to a new study in Melbourne, Australia .

"By . Pat Hagan . Millions of pounds a year are being paid out in compensation for childhood meningitis cases missed by GPs, new figures have reveal. Between 2008 and 2012, at least £28 million was given to families of children left permanently disabled as a result of GPs’ failure to diagnose the deadly infection, or refer suspected cases for emergency treatment. The Medical Defence Union, which made the payments on behalf of doctors in its insurance scheme, issued the alarming statistics recently as a warning to members of the dangers of missing meningitis. In 2011, schoolgirl Lydia Cross won a £1.78m payout after losing both her legs when she developed meningitis as a baby (pictured). Her parents begged a GP to carry out a home visit but they refused . One case involved a sum of £2.5million following a failure to refer a four-year-old child to hospital by a GP working out of hours. The child was later diagnosed with meningitis B and suffered severe disabilities, including the loss of a leg. The MDU said it is not unusual for cases to settle for well in excess of £1m because of the cost of providing care for disabled patients for the rest of their lives. Of the 17 claims it settled in the four year period, five involved out-of-hours consultations and two, home visits. The mounting compensation bill has renewed pressure for the Department of Health to sanction the use of a new meningitis B vaccine, which was rejected in July by a panel of experts on the grounds that it was not cost-effective. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, made up infectious disease experts, ruled against the life-saving jab and said more research was needed to confirm it was worth the cost of giving it to all infants. But meningitis charities last night . said the soaring compensation pay-outs highlight the need for the . vaccine to be introduced immediately. ‘We . think this strengthens the argument for the vaccine to be introduced as . soon as possible,’ said Linda Glennie, head of research and medical . information at the Meningitis Research Foundation. Lydia - now 12 - hopes to take part in the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, racing the 100 metres on blades similar to those made famous by Oscar Pistorius. She is pictured with her mother, Jodie . ‘We know from our own research that 50 per cent of children with meningococcal disease are sent home the first time they see their GP. ‘Yet these compensation payments are not included in the cost-effectiveness analysis on the vaccine.’ The Foundation says millions more . have been paid out by NHS hospital trusts over the last decade for . children and adults harmed by failure to spot meningitis. It says that money came from funds that would otherwise have been spent on patient care.

In 2011, schoolgirl Lydia Cross won a £1.78m payout after losing both her legs as a baby when a GP refused to carry out a home visit, despite pleas from her parents Tony and Jodie Cross, from Braunton in Devon.

Dr Sharmala Moodley, deputy head of claims at the MDU, said: ‘Meningitis is thankfully a rare disease, meaning most GPs will only see one or two cases in a lifetime of practice. ‘But failure to diagnose it can have devastating consequences for patients, some of whom will suffer irreversible injuries such as brain damage, loss of limbs and organ damage. ‘This is reflected in the high costs of compensation payments, especially where cases involve children who may need care for many years to come.’ She said GPs faced a major challenge because the early features of meningitis are often the same as those of minor viral illnesses. A vaccine against the meningitis C strain, introduced more than a decade ago, is thought to have saved thousands of lives. But the deadly B strain still strikes around 1,800 people a year, killing one in ten. The vast majority are children under five. Tests suggest the vaccine, called Bexsero, is effective against 73 per cent of the different subtypes of meningitis B.","Medical Defence Union, which made .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Britain is working with the US on a dramatic rescue mission to save tens of thousands of trapped Yazidi refugees in northern Iraq, it emerged tonight. Ministers are ‘hardening up’ plans to evacuate desperate families who have fled rampaging Islamic State forces massacring non-Muslims. Government sources told MailOnline they were putting a plan together to get people off Mount Sinjar, amid growing alarm over the safety of up to a quarter of a million people trapped in the area. ‘We are working as fast as we can. It’s clearly a complicated operation, but plans are firming up’ a source said. The operation – if it is given the go ahead – will be led by the US with close co-operation with forces in Turkey and Kurdish Iraq. The revelation - which came after the Government announced it was sending Chinook military helicopters to the region - will increase calls for Parliament to be recalled to give MPs a say on the UK's role in escalating humanitarian catastrophe. Scroll down for video . Chinook helicopters like this one used in Helmand, Afghanistan, could be deployed to Iraq to help stranded refugees fleeing ISIS forces . Ministers insist any action under discussion is purely humanitarian and does not merit the recall of Parliament from its summer recess. A Number 10 spokesperson said: ‘Our focus remains the humanitarian situation, particularly those trapped on Mount Sinjar. ‘As part of our efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering in Iraq, we are sending a small number of Chinook helicopters to the region for use if we decide we need further humanitarian relief options. ‘Meanwhile urgent planning to get those trapped on the mountainside to safety will continue in the coming days between ourselves and US, the Kurdish authorities and other partners.’ Number 10 also revealed the Government had agreed to transport some critical military supplies for Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State fighters. The developments tonight expose the Government's rapidly developing response to the sweeping advance of Islamist extremist threatening to massacre thousands of non-Muslims. Chinook helicopters, which could be used to rescue Yazidi refugees trapped on Mount Sinjar after fleeing rampaging Islamic State fighters, would join two RAF C130 Hercules planes already carrying out aid drops. A squadron of up to six or eight Tornado jets are also understood to be on their way to the region  amid growing alarm over the plight of up to a quarter of a million people trapped in northern Iraq. The proposal to send the Chinook helicopters was being discussed in a meeting of Government’s emergency Cobra committee this afternoon. The meeting was chaired by the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, with David Cameron still on holiday in Portugal and the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg with his family in Spain. Defence sources said the helicopters could be sent to the region in case they were needed at short notice. The RAF Hercules and Tornado aircraft are flying aid missions from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, but the Chinooks may need to operate from a much closer base. Up to a quarter of a million people have fled the advances of Islamic State fighters who crossed the border from Syria to create an Islamic ‘Caliphate’ stretching across the region. Iraqi Christians and members of the Yazidi sect have been given an ultimatum to convert to Islam or die. Reports have claimed many victims have been beheaded – with women and children even being buried alive. An RAF Hercules delivered emergency aid air to the people in Northern Iraq overnight after having to abort a mission on Saturday because there were too many refugees crowding the plane . Tens of thousands of refugees are trapped in desert with no food, water or shelter. Growing alarm in the UK over the humanitarian crisis unfolding has increased pressure on the Prime Minister to return from his holidays to get a grip on the Government’s response. RAF Tornado jets left the UK for Cyprus this afternoon, from where they are set to help efforts to deliver aid to the fleeing refugees. Three aircraft left shortly after 2pm and will carry out surveillance ahead of airdrops to refugees from Hercules aircraft. The MoD has stressed the jets would be taking on a humanitarian role and helping to identify safe areas on the ground on Mount Sinjar for supplies to be dropped. The Tornados have been equipped with reconnaissance pods, which will be used to carry out surveillance to help the RAF C-130 Hercules cargo planes target where humanitarian supplies should be dropped. The Ministry of Defence said the RAF cargo planes dropped a further two consignments of aid overnight, following a successful drop on Saturday. A total of three air drops have been carried out - one on Saturday and two last night - following the aborted attempt in the early hours of yesterday morning. British forces have dropped three rounds of aid to thousands of people trapped on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq . The Department for International Development said latest drops included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps that can also be used to charge mobile phones. And Downing Street has indicated that the Government is also looking at how it can play a role in getting equipment to Kurdish forces so they are better able to counter IS, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis). But voices continued to be raised in favour of a more direct military intervention - and for MPs to be recalled from their summer break to debate and vote on it. Tory MP Mark Pritchard became the latest to join politicians and former military chiefs in urging a stronger response, including targeted air strikes and drone attacks - but falling short of sending ground forces back to the country. He predicted a recalled Commons would vote in favour of the escalation. It comes as former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell has added his voice to mounting calls for Parliament to reconvene to discuss Britain's response. ‘The government would be well advised to recall Parliament,’ he said, to share with MPs ‘everything that the government has done and - at the moment at least - is intending to do’. Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border today . Islamic State militants have killed at least 500 members of Iraq's Yazidi ethnic minority during their offensive in the north, Iraq's human rights minister has claimed . The Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria, has prompted tens of thousands of Yazidis and Christians to flee for their lives during their push to within a 30-minute drive of the Kurdish regional capital Arbil . Arriving before the Cobra meeting, Mr Hammond was asked by reporters if MPs should be recalled to Westminster, but replied: ‘Not for the moment, no.’ A poll released tonight showed British voters now support taking part in air strikes against Islamic State fighters sweeping through northern Iraq slaughtering non-Muslims. The Government has refused to rule out joining a US military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees. But a ComRes poll for ITV News has revealed support for UK troops to bomb the fanatics. Some 45 per cent of Britons approve of the RAF taking part in air strikes – while 37 per cent disapprove. Last August 50 per cent of the country was opposed to missile strikes on Syria – with just 25 per cent in support.","The Government is working on plans to evacuate trapped refugees .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . Maximo Caminero, 51, plead guilty to criminal mischief for breaking a $1 million vase in an exhibit by famous Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei . A jealous artist who smashed Chinese Artist Ai Weiwei's $1 million vase at a museum in February 'as a political act' was found guilty of criminal mischief. Maximo Caminero, a 51-year-old artist from the Dominican Republic, will serve 100 hours of community service by teaching children how to paint and will be put on 18 months probation. The New York Times reports that Caminero must also pay $10,000 to Ai Weiei for the vase he broke at the Perez Art Museum in Miami, Florida. 'I think about what I did every day and I find it hard to live with what I did because it still haunts me,' Caminero said in a public apology. 'I know I have a debt to our society and I accept responsibility for my actions, but I ask you to give me an opportunity to redeem myself through working in the community as a way to make amends for my actions.' Caminero says he broke the vase as a political act and a way to attract attention to the lack of local artists showcasing their art. Caminero could have faced as many as five years in prison but the museum agreed to waive his sentence for community service. 'What I did was not good,' Mr. Caminero said. 'But I hope it serves to persuade others — including Ai Weiwei — not to do what I did.' According . to the arrest affidavit from February, Caminero picked up the ancient . vase painted over by Weiwei and a security guard told him to put it . down. Instead, . Caminero smashed the vase on the floor and 'spontaneously told [police] . that he broke the vase in protest of local artists and that the museum . only displayed international artists.' Caminero . had been working as a painter for 30 years and he was frustrated . that local artists like himself aren't showcased in Miami-area art . museums. Scroll down for video . Video footage: A camera caught Maximo Caminero dropping the vase in the Miami museum . Shattered: Maximo Caminero successfully drops the vase so it is broken beyond repair . 'I did it for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here,' Caminero told the Miami New Times back in February. 'They have spent so many millions now on international artists. It's the same political situation over and over again. I've been here for 30 years and it's always the same.' Caminero plans to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon to 'answer all the questions'. The police affidavit lists the value of the vase as $1 million - but Caminero said he had no idea it was that valuable and feels sorry for damaging such an expensive relic. 'If you saw the vases on display and the way they were painted there was no way one would think the artist had painted over an ancient artifact,' Caminero said. 'Instead I thought it was a common clay pot like you would find at Home Depot, frankly.' In addition to being a work of art by a famous artist, the vase is ancient and could be as much as 7,000 years old. Weiwei is arguably China's most famous artist, and probably best known for having designed the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium in Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. Artist and political activist: A sculptor, designer and documentary-maker, Ai Weiwei has irked Beijing by using his art and online profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law . A sculptor, designer and documentary-maker, Weiwei has irked Beijing by using his art and online profile to draw attention to injustices in China and the need for greater transparency and rule of law. He was detained for 81 days in 2011 during crackdown on dissent. After his release in June 2011, Ai's design firm was slapped with a $2.4million tax bill, which he fought unsuccessfully in the Chinese courts. According to museum's web site, the vase is one of more than a dozen that are part of a floor installation. Each vase is partially painted in bright colors. 'I was at PAMM and saw Ai Weiwei's photos behind the vases where he drops an ancient Chinese vase and breaks it. And I saw it as a provocation by Weiwei to join him in an act of performance protest.' Caminero has shown his art at the Gallery in West Palm Beach that offered a patrons a chance to meet him and 'view a sampling of the work from his 30-year career as an artist.' Before the break: A museum patron stands near the exhibit by artist Ai Weiwei: 'According To What?'  at the Perez Art Museum Miami .","Artist Maximo Caminero, 51, will serve 100 hours of community service by teaching children how to paint and will be put on 18 months probation .
Caminero must also pay $10,000 to Ai Weiei to help pay for the $1 million vase he broke at the Perez Art Museum in Miami, Florida back in February .
Caminero has since apologized profusely but says he broke the vase because he thought local artists weren't getting enough space at  the Perez Art Museum in Miami .

For when boxer Shannon Briggs barged in on Wladimir Klitschko's meal, it ended in humiliating fashion - with a glass of water over the head. Klitschko, 38, was tucking in to a bowl of food at an Italian restaurant in Miami, Florida when Briggs, who hopes to take on the Ukrainian in a title fight, arrived uninvited. Scroll down for video . Flashpoint: Wladimir Klitschko, left, takes matters into his own hands by pouring water over Shannon Briggs, right, after the 42-year-old had started eating his food . The 42-year-old was then filmed saying: 'What's up champ? I told you champ, wherever you go I go, champ. What you do I do, champ. I train champ, you train champ. Let’s fight, champ. In video footage of the incident, taken by an onlooker at the restaurant, Briggs then sits down opposite the current WBA, IBF, WBO, IBO champion before grabbing his food and eating some of it. 'What you eat I eat,' he is heard saying as he starts to eat Klitschko's food. 'I told you, everything you do I do. Thanks, champ.' Humiliation: A man wearing a yellow T-shirt arrives and grabs Shannon Briggs, left, before the boxer slips over, right, amid chaotic scenes in the Italian restaurant . At first, Klitschko appears calm and starts to pour himself some water. But seconds later, he can be seen tipping the contents over his rival's head, sparking chaotic scenes. Briggs then appears to knock the glass from his hand before knocking the food from the table, shouting: 'You pour water on my head? You pour water on my head?' A large man can then be seen arriving and grabbing Briggs, pushing him out of the restaurant.

In the struggle, Briggs loses his footing and slips over while his would-be opponent in the ring looks at his hand as if it had been injured during the clash. According to Fightnews.com, Briggs suffered a cut hand and foot. It was the second time in a fortnight that Briggs had confronted Klitschko. He recently squared up to the Ukrainian while he was at a gym in South Florida and challenged him to a fight. In April, Briggs crashed into a news conference involving Vladimir Klitschko demanding a title bout. Not only is Klitschko heralded for his fighting, he's got his own collection of famous friends and family in tow. Klitschko is engaged to Hollywood actress, model, and singer Hayden Panettiere. Rumor has it that the couple of two years has a baby on the way. The 24-year-old blonde Nashville star flashed her baby bump on vacation in Sardinia in late June. Another little known fact is that Klitschko comes from a political family and his brother Vitali Klitschko is a Ukranian politiciant and the current mayor of Kiev.

'It just seemed logical to change my license plate to something I believed in,' she continued. When Calk called to ask the state why she'd been denied they told her message could be read as vulgar and that she wasn't the first person to be denied that specific license plate.

"By . Harriet Hernando for MailOnline . As far as hat-tricks go, they don't get much better than this. Teenager Kevin Libertowski nets a basketball in his back garden in Cleveland, Ohio no less than three times by performing a back-flip in a variety of positions. First up, a pal throws the basketball at the 17-year-old's feet and he times it just right to back-flip, kick the ball, then score. Next, the teen bounces on a trampoline with the ball between his feet before flipping over and hurling it straight into the net. And last up, Kevin takes a run at the net, back-flips with the ball in his hand, shoots, then scores. The trampoline trick shot went viral last year and has attracted more than 200,000 hits along with 7,000 subscribers who tune into KDP Productions to see his skilful shots. High school student Kevin said: 'I started developing my acrobatic skills by teaching myself a variety of flips and moves on the trampoline. 'Then once I had mastered that trick, I'd do them on the ground. 'After doing thousands of flips, it was quite easy to start incorporating basketball shots into them. Kevin Libertowski, 17, from Ohio, shows of his skills as he nets this ball while doing a back-flip . 'My first video got hundreds of thousands of views, so I decided to make more videos of other shots just like it.' Kevin says it takes two days to create each video and get the shot right exactly right. He said: 'First I have to come up with the idea, then make sure it is actually possible to do. 'Then I have to practice the flip enough so that I actually feel comfortable doing it with a ball in my hands or feet and feel confident enough to make the shot. 'Then we have to film it which can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how the shot goes. On average around an hour in a half to make the trickiest shots.'","Kevin Libertowski performs incredible tricks in his back garden .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Leesa Smith For Daily Mail Australia . Police have had another breakthrough in the cold case of a triple murder after finding a buried container on a property connected to the 1974 deaths of Barbara McCulkin and her two daughters. On Saturday morning, detectives from the Warwick Criminal Investigation Branch, Homicide Cold Case Unit and State Drug and Serious Crime Illicit Laboratories Investigation Team (ILIT) used an excavator to unearth a buried shipping container on the Massie property - north-west of Warwick in Queensland. The container with a concealed hatch was located and ILIT members used breathing apparatus to examine the contents found inside for more evidence of drug trafficking. Scroll down for video . Queensland police have unearthed a shipping container on a property connected to the 1974 murders of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters . Inside the container - which is believed to have been there for a number of years - police found what looks to be containers filled with bags of unknown objects . This is the second time the property has been search and belongs to 66-year-old Thomas Martin, who was charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences last week . Queensland police believe the container had been buried at the Massie property, near Warwick, on Willowvale Road for a number of years. Detective Inspector Mick Dowie said further information from the public had resulted in the find. 'As a result of fresh information received from the public we have returned to the property to inspect a suspicious site and located a buried shipping container,' he said. 'For the safety of investigators we have called upon the assistance of ILIT members to process the contents of the container. We are still assessing the contents.'Investigations are ongoing and there is no further information available at this time. The property belongs Thomas 'Teddy' Martin who was granted bail in Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Friday after he was arrested for drug trafficking and weapons offences, according to the ABC. Last week, police remove drums filled with drugs from the property in Warwick, allegedly run as an alpaca farm by Vincent O'Dempsey as a front for a marijuana operation . This is the second time the 66-year-old's property was raided by police. This comes after police seized seized drums full of shrink-wrapped bags of cannabis and $300,000 in cash from another property near Warwick last week. Drugs and cash have been seized from a property owned by gangster Vincent O'Dempsey, who had not been seen for days . It was reportedly run as an alpaca farm by known criminal Vincent O'Dempsey. O'Dempsey, who was named as a ‘person of interest’ in the 1974 murders of Barbara McCulkin and her two daughters has not been seen for days, The Courier Mail reported. Police are investigating whether there is a link between O’Dempsey and the 66- year-old man who is expected to appear at Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Thursday. The whereabouts of O’Dempsey’s associate Gary ‘Shorty’ Dubois, another person of interest in the murder investigation, are also unknown. Both men, for whom police have not issued arrest warrants, were charged with the murders in 1980 following a coronial inquest but the case collapsed due to a lack of evidence. The day before Wednesday's drug raid, homicide detectives found evidence in at two properties linked to O’Dempsey - including his Exquisite Alpacas breeding operation. A jar containing financial records was also discovered. In 1974, during the summer school holidays, Barbara McCulkin, 43, was at home in Highgate Hill, Brisbane, with her daughters Vicky, 13, and 11-year-old Leanne. The two girls had been at a birthday party and returned home as their mother was doing her chores. At some point two men visited the house and were seen by one of the girl's friends. O`Dempsey, who is a key 'person of interest' in the 1974 murders of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters and lives nearby the property, is believed to have gone underground . Barbara, Vicky and Leanne McCulkin vanished and no trace of their bodies has ever been found. Despite several police investigations, a coronial inquest and the charges being laid against O'Dempsey and Dubois the three murders have remained unsolved and have become one of the most notorious killings in Australian history. Forty years on, police are confident they are closer to an arrest, as well as focussed on the potential motives for the murders. The first motive relates to sexual assault of the two young McCulkin girls, and that Barbara McCulkin was willing to exchange information about a criminal gang. The second motive is that Ms McCulkin was murdered because she knew too much about one of Australia's most notorious crimes - the firebombing mass murder at the Whiskey au Go Go nightclub on Brisbane's sleazy city strip, known as 'The Valley'. Did she know too much? Brisbane housewife Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Leanne (left) and Vicky (right) vanished from their Highgate Hill home in inner Brisbane on January 16, 1974 and have never been seen again. Last week, police searched two properties 150km away at Warwick, south-west of Brisbane, and are confident they have some clues to the abduction and murder of the three which are connected with the underworld . Criminal connections; Barbara McCulkin, pictured with 13-year-old daughter Vicky, was the estranged wife of a debt collector, Billy McCulkin, who had criminal connections. But the 34-year-old housewife was also described as a devoted mother-of-two who enjoyed making ballet costumes for her girls . Sinister clue: the firebombing mass murder of the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub the year prior to the McCulkins' abduction and murder might hold clues to their fate. Barbara McCulkin might have been willing to provide detectives with the names of a criminal syndicate with connections to the fire which broke out on March 8, 1973, when two 43- gallon drums of diesel were thrown into the foyer, lit, and 15 people died of asphyxiation . Forty years after Barbara McCulkin (above, left) vanished along with her two daughters, Vicky, 13, and 11-year-old Leanne (above, right), her family requested police look into the abduction-murder case. Now police believe they have clues lead to the potential arrest of suspects in the case, which has sexual abuse motives, police say . The firebombing which tore apart inner Brisbane in the early hours of March 8, 1973, occurred after drums of diesel were thrown into the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub and lit, patrons prevented from fleeing after someone had greased the fire exits. An ABC TV reporter (pictured, left) reports on the devastating after math, which saw 15 people asphyxiated. Now detectives say the abduction and murder of 13-year-old Vicky McCulkin (above right), her younger sister and her mother may be connected with the case . Ms McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections. The previous year, on March 8, 1973, two 43- gallon drums of diesel were thrown into the Whiskey au Go Go foyer and lit. The fire escapes were covered in grease, preventing the nightclubbers from escaping. Questions are still being asked to this day about who else may have been behind the fatal firebombing of the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub, for which two men, James Finch, 29, and John Stuart, 33 were convicted. Brisbane housewife Barbara McCulkin may have been willing to give police information over a criminal gang connected with the atrocity before she and her daughters were abducted . Fifteen people died in the fire, three of them musicians who were performing at the club. Two men, James Richard Finch, 29, and John Andrew Stuart, 33, were convicted of arson and murder as part of an extortion campaign. But rumours continued to swirl over who else was involved in the mass murder plot. The case foundered for lack of evidence, but in January this year, at the request of Ms McCulkins' family on the 40th anniversary of the murders, police commenced a full review of the case with a new focus on the motive for the suspected murders. Investigators joined with the Crime and Corruption Commission to pursue significant new evidence in four states. 'Detectives have interviewed potential witnesses across Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria and have uncovered compelling new evidence surrounding events that took place on the day of their disappearance and subsequent murders,' Detective Superintendent Steve Holahan of the Homicide Group said. 'Based on the evidence collected, we now believe we have identified several motives for their murders. Barbara McCulkin may have had knowledge about serious crimes and the young McCulkin girls may have been sexually assaulted.' A $250,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the murderers has been  offered, as well as an indemnity from prosecution for anyone who supplies information that leads to a conviction.

"By . Ollie Gillman For Mailonline . Sinan Inan, 33, is accused of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old woman in his barber's shop. He denies the allegation . A hairdresser massaged a customer's breasts after giving her a cut and blow dry because he wanted to improve his skills before opening a massage parlour, a court has heard. The horrified 21-year-old victim was looking for a trim when she entered Sinan Inan's Elite Men's Barber Shop in July last year, but was offered a massage as part of the deal. The woman, who cannot be named, told Bristol Crown Court that Inan, 33, moved his hands 'under her bra' after moving on from her shoulders. She said: 'He went from my shoulders to my chest, lower and lower until he was in my bra, on my boobs. 'He was using all of his hands on my chest. He was behind me, doing a circular motion under my bra. 'I thought the whole situation was a bit weird. He was getting lower and lower and lower. 'I knew as soon as he started feeling my boobs the line was crossed. That's when I knew something was wrong.' Inan offered a massage to the woman after telling her that he planned to open a parlour above his shop in Downend, Bristol, the court was told. The woman said she did not want to turn down Inan's offer of a massage as she did not want to seem rude. CCTV footage played to the jury appeared to show Inan moving his hands from the woman's shoulders and neck and down her top. The woman said: 'I was shocked. How do you get away from someone standing over you like that? 'I was scared. I knew something was wrong. I was in shock for days. 'I didn't know how to get out of the situation.' Inan, who denies sexual assault, told the court that the woman asked him why a haircut would cost £11. He replied that a lot could be included such as a hair wash. After the hair cut he offered to massage her. The woman told the court that she entered Elite Men's Barber Shop, in Downend, Bristol, looking for a trim . Speaking through a Turkish interpreter, he said: 'She was very happy. 'The massage produces endorphin hormones and they keep you happy. 'Rather than being in shock, you come out from the shock.' Inan, from Fishponds, Bristol, told the court the woman had said she felt sleepy and that when he asked her if it was hurting she said it did not. He added: 'She didn't tell me to stop massaging her. She didn't show any displeasure. It was the other way around.' The trial continues.

"By . Marc Horne . They are the 20th Century’s most monstrous icons and have sparked fear and fascination from the Highlands to Hollywood. But now it has been claimed that King Kong gave birth to the myth of the Loch Ness monster. New research from America’s Columbia University suggests the sightings in northern Scotland were triggered by the release of the 1933 classic, which, along with the giant rampaging gorilla, also featured a long-necked, hump-backed lake creature. Scroll down for video . Monstrous icons: It has been claimed that King Kong gave birth to the myth of the Loch Ness monster. Left, the 1993 blockbuster King Kong and, right, the shadowy photograph of 'Nessie' that caused a global sensation . Author Daniel Loxton says the first reported sighting of a ‘plesiosaur-like dinosaur’ in the Loch was made by Londoner George Spicer in August 1933 – when King Kong  was playing to packed cinemas in the UK. Mr Loxton said: ‘Previous witnesses had reported splashes or humps in the water, but Spicer reported a close-up view of a long-necked creature that could have been lifted right off King Kong’s Skull Island. Indeed, I believe that is what happened. His yarn gave rise to many other sightings, making the ‘‘plesiosaur’’ a favourite explanation for Nessie throughout the 20th Century.’ The following year, a photograph of the Loch Ness monster caused a global sensation. Hit film: The giant rampaging gorilla, King Kong, is pictured with actress Naomi Watts in the 2005 remake . The shadowy picture became the definitive image of Nessie until the 1990s, when it was proved it had been created by attaching a cut-out dinosaur head to a toy submarine. Marine biologist Adrian Shine, who has studied the Loch for more than 40 years, backed Mr Loxton’s theory. He said: ‘I believe that King Kong was the main influence behind the “Jurassic Park” hypothesis at Loch Ness. Before Spicer’s sighting there were no long-neck reports at all.’","New research suggests sightings of 'Nessie' linked to classic King Kong .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A young woman was seen crying out to strangers for help after being targeted in an 'acid attack' as she stood at a bus stop. The victim, believed to be 22, suffered ‘horrendous’ injuries after the corrosive liquid was thrown in her face in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Witnesses said the victim ran across the road, desperately screaming for her mother, as the acid-like substance burned into her skin and hair. Scroll down for video . A young woman has been left with 'life-changing injuries' to her face and neck after being targeted in an 'acid attack' while she was standing at this bus stop in Lowestoft, Suffolk . The woman also begged for strangers to bring her water while screaming 'all my face is burning'. The victim was taken to the James Paget . Hospital at Gorleston near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk and was expected to . be moved to a specialist burn unit. Police say the victim is believed to have suffered 'life-changing injuries' to her face, chest and arms. The attack, which took place on London Road South at 8.20am on Thursday, was caught on CCTV camera installed at a nearby pub. Leon Thompson, 38, from Lowestoft, who was arrested two hours after the incident, has been charged with throwing a corrosive fluid with intent to disfigure and cause grievous bodily harm. He appeared at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court in Ipswich, where he was remanded in custody until his next appearance on August 26. A 25 year-old man was arrested on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily. He is still being questioned at the Great Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre. Officers were last night unable to confirm or deny whether or not the suspect was known to the victim. But MailOnline understands it is not being treated as a random attack and that the woman was intentionally targeted. After the substance was thrown, several residents brought out water from nearby houses to pour over the woman's head in a desperate bid to wash away the liquid. Jamie Gregg, 20, said she was asleep when she was woken up by the woman’s screams. She . said: 'It was really loud. I heard her yelling, ‘Get me water’. I . looked out of the window and saw her running across the road away from . the bus stop. 'The poor girl had her head to her side . and was holding her shoulder length blonde hair as if she was trying to . keep it away from her face. Witnesses said the woman was seen running across the road, screaming for her mother, after the corrosive liquid was thrown in her face on Thursday morning. Pictured: The bus stop where the incident took place . 'She stopped outside the pub and there were several people trying to help her. Someone yelled out to bring her a chair. 'I quickly got dressed and ran out with a chair for her and a glass of water while someone else brought out water in a jug. 'She was calling out for her mum and saying, ‘All my face is burning’ as she splashed the water on her face. 'It . looked like the liquid had gone on the right side of her face. Her . injuries were horrendous. Her skin was all pink and peeling off. The . ambulance was here within five or ten minutes.' Miss Gregg’s partner Jamie Silverman, 33, said: 'She was apparently standing at the bus stop with a couple of elderly people. Police said a 38-year-old man, Leon Thompson, from Lowestoft, will appear in court in relation to the incident . 'It looked like she was minding her own business when this guy just came up and chucked something in her face before running away . 'Some people said that the guy tried to steal her phone and got away with her bank card which he dropped nearby. 'But others have suggested that she might have been deliberately targeted. It is just an awful thing to happen.' Emma Luscher, 22, who is on maternity leave with her 12-week-old son, said she was also woken by the woman screaming. She said: 'She was screaming, saying ‘someone help me, please get me some water’. 'She . was screaming over and over again. I couldn’t get up because I was . feeding my baby. 'I heard her go up the road and thought it was a drunk . person at first because round here you sometimes get people like that. 'She was calling out for her mum and saying, ""All my face is burning"" as she splashed the water on her face' Witness Jamie Gregg . 'I . could still hear her screaming. A few minutes later I heard an . ambulance go past and realised it must be something. Then police came . and cordoned it off. 'You . don’t think of things like that happening here. It was quite scary with . having a new born. It makes you feel you’re not safe. I just hope she’s . alright.' Nearby resident Yvonne Stewart, 75,  said: 'I was getting up when I heard this really weird screaming. 'I looked out of the window and saw this woman jumping around with her hands to her head. 'There were various people around who were trying to help her and others were coming across the road. 'I saw someone pour water over her head and I thought then that it might have been some sort of acid attack. 'It is normally quiet around here. We are not used to anything like this.' A 55-year-old . woman, who did not want to be named, said: 'I didn’t see what happened. All I heard was just horrible screams. The bus stop has been cordoned off while police carry out investigations into the attack. They said the substance had not been identified but was believed to be 'of a corrosive nature' 'I got up, looked through the . curtain and just saw someone running down the road. It was horrific.' The manager of the nearby Carlton pub confirmed the attack had been filmed by his pub’s CCTV camera. He said that the film had been taken by police, but refused to comment further. After the incident, the bus stop where the attack took place was cordoned off while forensic tests were carried out. Police said they were initially called by the East of England Ambulance Service to a report that a woman had suffered facial injuries after having a liquid thrown in her face . A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'Although the substance has not yet been identified it is believed to have been of a corrosive nature. 'The woman, who is aged in her 20s has sustained injuries to her face and neck. In the first instance she has been taken to the James Paget Hospital to be treated for her injuries. 'Searches of the area were carried out by officers and with the use of the police helicopter. 'At approximately 10.35am a 38-year-old man was detained and arrested by officers in the town on suspicion of assault. He has been taken to the Gt Yarmouth Police Investigation Centre for questioning. 'An area remains cordoned off whilst police continue with their enquiries and gather evidence. The area will need to remain cordoned off in order to professionally clear the area of the liquid.' The spokesman appealed for the public to . keep an eye out for the bottle which may have been used during the attack. She said a sports-style bottle, possibly a Lucozade bottle, could have been used before being discarded. Two bottles matching that description have been sent off for forensic testing. She . warned members of the public not to pick up any other bottles matching that description in case it still had any corrosive . liquid inside. Police have been searching for the bottle . in the area of the bus stop and an alleyway near the bus stop where the man is believed to have run.

With its well-manicured greens and fabulous beach side location, the 18-hole course at Cancun has a deserved reputation as a golfer’s paradise. For Dougie Thomson, however, it turned out to be a living hell. The 58-year-old British tourist is lucky to be alive after he was attacked by a 12ft crocodile at the Mexican resort. He was only saved when his friends beat the animal with their clubs and drove a golf buggy over it repeatedly to get it to release its grip from his right thigh. Father-of-two Mr Thomson needed an emergency operation after the attack which happened as he played a bunker shot near a tropical swamp. The engineer is now recovering in hospital after having his leg put back together with 200 stitches. Relatives are preparing to fly him back home so he can continue his recovery. Mr Thomson was attacked as he played at the Iberostar Cancun Golf Course. Recalling the drama from his  hospital bed, he said: ‘My ball was in the bunker around ten to 15 feet from thick shrubbery. 'I didn’t even know there was water behind the bushes. I took a shot and it landed on the green. ‘Then I heard this noise behind me and this huge crocodile snapped me by the thigh. I couldn’t feel pain. I was in total shock. ‘It was like a big toy, big black eyes looking at me. Hitting it was like hitting a brick wall.’ Mr Thomson said his leg 'looked like a butcher's shop window' after being savaged by the crocodile . One of Mr Thomson’s two friends had to drive his golf buggy over the crocodile while the other two hit it with their clubs. Savaged: A crocodile like the one that carried out the attack . The . animal attacked the golf cart before slinking back into the swamp from . where it had first appeared. Mr Thomson, who had travelled to Mexico for . a wedding, said: ‘The crocodile tore away all the muscle in my thigh. My leg is like a butcher’s shop window. Initially only two of us were . going golfing. ‘If that had . happened, there is no way one friend could have helped. It would have . pulled me back into the lagoon and had me for supper.’ He added: ‘Even after it  happened, other people were still playing golf. ‘You’d . have thought there would have been at least a policeman to take a . report. When my friend went back, the crocodile was still there, just . waiting.’ Doctors are now monitoring Mr Thomson for  infections and . checking him for tendon damage. Brother Bob Thomson said the attack had left the whole family ‘traumatised and shocked’. He . said: ‘We are worried and wondering what kind of golf course would . allow these animals to roam around. 'We hope Douglas will be able to . continue working and playing golf but we don’t know.’ Mr . Thomson, from Wishaw near Glasgow, is the second golfer to be bitten by . a crocodile at the same golf course in recent months. American Edward . Lunger, 50, was taking a practice swing when a crocodile leapt from . behind some bushes and bit off two of his fingers.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . The Pakistani Government led by Mamnoon Hussain, dismissed the reports as 'mischievous and baseless' Pakistan is ready to give nuclear weapons to Saudi Arabia to counter any future threat from Iran, it was claimed last night. BBC’s Newsnight has spoken to sources in Pakistan who told them they had been preparing for the possibility for some time. Reporter Mark Urban said the programme understood that if a deal were to go ahead, Saudi Arabia could have the nuclear weapons operational and ready to deploy within the time it would take Iran to do the same. The claim comes as the US and other Western powers are trying to get Iran back to the negotiating table to discuss its nuclear ambitions. America has for some time been claiming that Iran is developing nuclear weapons – an allegation that Iran denies. Iran’s alleged ambitions have worried its enemy Saudi Arabia so much, it is feared that the oil-rich state is now preparing to obtain its own nuclear deterrent, raising the possibility of a Middle East arms race. Newsnight said its sources had told reporters that Pakistan had left a ‘certain number of warheads’ available, if the Saudis asked for them, which could ‘immediately be delivered’. The development has the potential to derail US diplomatic attempts to bring peace to the region. Relations between the US and Iran have been cold since the revolution in 1979, but were given hope with the election of moderate leader Hassan Rouhani earlier this year. Mr Rouhani shared a phone call with President Obama in late September, the first time leaders of the two countries had spoken for more than 30 years. Saudi Arabia acquiring nuclear weapons would make it less likely that Iran would abandon any weapons programme it may have. Though relations have been fraught between the US and Iran, the election of moderate leader Hassan Rouhani earlier this year breathed new hope into the situation . Failure to get Iran round the table will also make it harder to get the Israelis, who see Iran as their biggest threat, to agree to downsize their own nuclear weapons capability. Last night the Pakistani and Saudi governments released statements in response to the Newsnight claims. Pakistan described the programme’s assertions as ‘secular, mischievous and baseless’. Saudi Arabia pointed out that it was a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It added that its determination to keep the Middle East non-nuclear was one of the  reasons it recently refused to take a seat on the United Nations Security Council.","Reports indicate Pakistan has been preparing deal for 'some time'

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis has been questioned by Swiss police after her estranged husband said he was attacked by the tennis star and her family. Thibault Hutin, a French equestrian athlete who married Miss Hingis in 2010, accused the 33-year-old and her mother of beating and scratching him before taking his valuables. He also claimed that the mother’s boyfriend hit him with a DVD player during the alleged assault on September 23. A police spokesman said the tennis star, her mother Melanie Molitor and her mother’s boyfriend Mario Widmer were interviewed last week. Former tennis star Martina Hingis with husband Thibault Hutin in 2011. Mr Hutin has claimed his wife and mother-in-law beat and scratched him then 'whacked' him on the head with a DVD player . The couple pictured in 2011. Miss Hingis became the youngest Grand Slam champion of all time when she won the Wimbledon doubles title in 1996, aged 15, but effectively retired six years ago after multiple injuries . The local justice department will decide possible further action, but no timetable has been set for a decision. Mr Hutin, 26, spoke to the Swiss press last month about the alleged attack. He claimed he was ‘beaten and scratched’ by Hingis and her mother, and then ‘whacked’ on the head with a DVD player by the mother’s boyfriend. He said that he was so ‘terrified’ he had moved into a hotel and plans to return to his native France. He added: ‘Naturally, my upbringing forbids me to hit women.’ Mr Hutin said that after fleeing he realised his wallet and credit cards were missing, and then returned with police to reclaim them. ‘I was shocked. I would never have thought it could go so far. I’m really afraid,’ he said. The private life of the couple, who wed in 2010, had hit the headlines in July after Mr Hutin claimed Miss Hingis had destroyed their marriage with repeated infidelity. Miss Hingis responded only by saying that the couple had separated at the start of the year. Although she is still only 33, Hingis effectively retired from top-level tennis six years ago, following a series of injuries. Martina Hingis at the China Open in 2007.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . A morbidly obese two-year-old has become the youngest person in the world to undergo a gastrectomy - where most of the stomach is cut away. The parents of the toddler from Saudi Arabia - who weighed more than 5st and had a Body Mass Index of 41 - sought help because he suffered severe breathing problems while asleep. Two attempts to control his weight by dieting failed, wrote his surgeons in an article in the International Journal of Surgery Case Reports. Operation: A morbidly obese two-year-old has become the youngest person in the world to undergo bariatric surgery . Gastrectomy is a drastic alternative to gastric band or bypass surgery - none of which would ever be carried out on pre-teen children in the UK. When he first presented to an endocrinologist at 14 months the toddler weighed 3st 4lb, but after dieting for four months his weight increased to more than 4st. The doctors from Prince Sultan Military Medical City at Riyadh were unable to ascertain whether the child’s parents had stuck to the diet. A further attempt at dieting failed and when his weight passed 5st, and his legs were bowing, doctors decided to perform surgery. Surgeons carried out a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy on the boy which involved removing the outer margin of the stomach to restrict food intake, leaving about 30% of the stomach as a ‘sleeve’ roughly the size and shape of a banana. ‘To our knowledge LSG has never been tried in very young age children,’ the surgeons say in their report. ‘We present here probably the first case report of the successful management of a two year old morbidly obese boy.’ Drastic: Surgeons removed the outer margin of the stomach to restrict food intake, leaving about 30% of the stomach as a 'sleeve' the size and shape of a banana . Within two months the boy lost 15 per cent of his body weight and two years after the 2010 surgery his weight had fallen back to 3st 10lb and his BMI of 24 was within the normal range. International experts said the case was ‘shocking’ and ‘very unusual’. Professor Paul Zimmett, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Australia, said: ‘We have no idea what effect this may have on the child’s growth and unless he has proper follow up he may suffer vitamin deficiencies.’ NHS guidelines say that any type of braiatric surgey would only be considered for British children ‘in exceptional circumstances’ and ‘only if the child is physically mature’ - typically 13 for girls and 15 for boys.","At 5st the toddler's legs bowed and doctors in Riyadh decided to operate .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . More than 80 elephants were killed when ivory poachers poisoned their watering holes with cyanide. The animals were struck down when ‘salt licks’ next to pools where they drink and bathe were contaminated with the deadly chemical. Elephants need salt to survive and the hunters cynically knew they would be drawn to the poison. Dozens of elephants were found in Zimbabwe’s Hwange National Park with bloody gaps where their tusks had been ripped out. Slaughter: More than 80 elephants have been killed after ivory poachers in Zimbabwe poisoned their watering holes with cynanide, endangering one of the world's biggest herds. (Stock image) Zimbabwe is home to some of Africa’s . largest elephant herds, with half of its estimated 80,000 population . thought to be in Hwange. The sprawling 5,657-square mile park . is one of the few places in Africa to have escaped the rapid decline in . the continent’s elephant population. Police said the poachers mixed a . cocktail of cyanide with salt and water and poured it on to about 35 . salt licks – exposed deposits of minerals that animals use to get . nutrients vital for their survival. The poachers also buried containers . of their deadly mixture on the edge of watering holes, where elephants . drink and bathe, to contaminate the water supply. When police arrived at the sites they found the mutilated bodies of elephants strewn around. However, some of the smaller . elephants still had tusks in place – apparently because it had not been . worth taking them. The poachers were said to have been paid £450 for . every nine large tusks. The poisonings occurred in July when . the national park’s security forces, which protect herds from the . ever-present threat from ivory poachers, were switched to covering the . Zimbabwe general election and its aftermath. Majestic: Elephants taking a mud bath at Hwange National Park, home to 40,000 of the massive animals, where poachers struck as security forces were preoccupied with policing the recent contested election . There had been fears of violent demonstrations amid allegation that President Robert Mugabe’s landslide victory was rigged. Since discovering the carcasses, . police and rangers have searched villages close to the park and . recovered 19 tusks, cyanide and wire snares. Nine alleged poachers were arrested. A South African businessman has also been accused of being behind the poisonings. Police claim that he used a Zimbabwean farmer and an ivory buyer to distribute cyanide to villagers. Saviour Kasukuwere, Zimbabwe’s environment minister, said the country . was clamping down on ivory poachers as it tries to revive its tourism . industry which has suffered years of decline. ‘We are declaring war on the poachers,’ he said. ‘We are responding with all our might . because our wildlife, including the elephants they are killing, are . part of the natural resources and wealth that we want to benefit the . people of Zimbabwe.’ A spokesman for the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said hundreds of animals were now at risk as a result of the contamination . Mr Kasukuwere said he would push for . stiff penalties for convicted poachers, who routinely get less than the . nine-year jail term imposed for cattle rustling. A wide range of other animal . carcasses were also found near the contaminated watering holes, . including buffalo, lions, vultures, antelopes and jackals. And last night there were fears that . more animals could die in coming weeks as anything that feasted on the . elephants’ toxic carcasses could have also become poisoned. A spokesman for the Zimbabwe . Conservation Task Force said: ‘When other animals and birds feed on the . rotting elephant carcasses, they will also die from the poison. Hundreds . of animals are now at risk.’ China, which accounts for 40 per cent . of the world’s trade in elephant tusks, is said to be one of the main . markets for the Zimbabwean ivory, where it has been regarded as a symbol . of wealth and status for thousands of years.","Poachers struck while security forces were occupied with policing election .

The YouGov Deutschland survey also showed a majority of Germans believe a British exit from the EU would be bad for both Germany and the EU. Nearly two in three Germans polled said Germany and Britain could be strong allies in reforming the EU, though France is still viewed as Germany’s most important ally. A YouGov Deutschland survey has revealed a majority of Germans do not trust European Union institutions (file picture) David Cameron, who has pledged to hold a referendum on Britain’s continued EU membership by 2017, is the most trusted foreign EU leader among Germans, four points ahead of French President Francois Hollande. Fewer than one in three Germans trust the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, and the European Parliament fared only slightly better, said the poll, which interviewed 1,010 adults last month. Half of those surveyed said they backed efforts by some EU politicians, who include Cameron, to repatriate powers from the European level, while 26 percent were opposed. A majority of Germans wanted to cut Berlin’s contribution to the EU budget and thought farm and regional aid subsidies - the two largest budget items - should be dealt with at the national level. 'Though Germany will remain wedded to . Europe, once the question of EU powers is boiled down to specific . policies, there is widespread support among German public opinion for . the return of powers from Brussels to member states,' said Nina Schick, . an analyst at the Open Europe think-tank which published the poll. The findings chime with a previous . YouGov poll published on September 3 that underlined German weariness . with bailing out ailing euro zone members after three years of debt . crisis, and confirmed a loss of appetite for 'more Europe' in Germany, . which has traditionally backed closer EU integration. Reform: After three years of bailing out broken economies, the Germans are increasingly tired of the EU . A new anti-euro party, the Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD), could break the five per cent barrier to enter parliament after the election on Sunday, though opinion polls show a strong majority of Germans continue to back the common currency. Chancellor Angela Merkel is tipped to win Germany’s election on Sunday, though it is unclear who will join her conservatives in the next coalition government. Merkel, who has backed off from her earlier calls for 'more Europe', has forged a good working relationship with Cameron and has refrained from criticising his push for looser British ties to the EU.","Fewer than one in three Germans trust the European Commission .

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Old Harrovian Neil Heywood was murdered because he threatened to expose the corrupt ownership of a luxury French Riviera villa by a powerful Chinese couple, it was claimed today. Heywood’s close relationship with the politically elite Bo family quickly soured after he was accused of withholding the ‘£800,000 rent’ from the £2million hilltop mansion near Cannes. Speaking at the trial of disgraced top Communist Party chief Bo Xilai,  Heywood’s killer Gu Kailai – the estranged wife of Bo – alleged in a video testimony that the Briton became angry when told he would no longer be a partner in the lucrative property. Scandal: Disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai . is shown seated in court in Jinan, in eastern . China's Shandong province, as he stands trial on charges related to the murder of British . businessman Neil Heywood . The couple ‘were given’ the . six-bedroom bougainvillea-clad mansion overlooking Cannes  -  complete . with a patio swimming pool, 4,000-square-meter garden and views of the . Mediterranean -  in 2000 as a ‘gift’ from a Chinese billionaire . businessman, Xu Ming. ‘The plan was to rent it out to make some money’, Gu told the court in Jinan as she testified against her husband. She . said she transferred ownership of Villa Fontaine Saint Georges to . Heywood and another family friend, named as Patrick Devillers, a French . architect, in 2007 to hide it from the authorities as her husband rose . through the political ranks. But . she claimed Heywood and Devillers were refusing to hand over the rent . they collected so in early 2011 she told them she was ending the . arrangement and would terminate their stake in the property. Murdered: Bo's wife Gu Kailai admitted to killing Mr Heywood, pictured, by poisoning him with cyanide and received a suspended death sentence . Gu, 54, . said Heywood, 41, attempted to blackmail the couple by demanding £1.4m . to walk away from the deal - money he claimed he was owed - and . threatened to expose the couple’s corrupt ownership of the villa if his . demands were not met. He also threatened the safety the couple’s 25-year-old son Guagua, she claimed. Her . statement pieces together to the murky sequence of events that led to . the murder of the Harrow-educated Heywood, a father of two, in November . 2011. Shortly before his . death, the China-based Briton told friends he felt threatened by couple . and had left documents detailing their overseas investments with his . lawyer in Britain as an “insurance policy” in case anything happened to . him. He was later lured by . Gu  to a hotel room in Chongqing, where Bo was party chief,    to . discuss ‘business’ but was allegedly poisoned by Gu’s henchman. On Gu’s orders, police hastily cremated his body and Heywood’s family was told he had died from alcohol abuse . But . it was alleged Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun secretly took a body . sample from the morgue, which he later took to US officials after a bust . up with his boss, Bo. Wang’s . flight to a US consulate and request for asylum sparked China’s biggest . political scandal in decades and Bo - once tipped as a potential leader . - was arrested 18 months ago. He . is now on trial accused of bribery, corruption and abuse of power - the . latter charged related to his allege cover up of Heywood’s murder by . his wife. ‘He should know about it all,’ Gu said, referring to Bo as he listened from the dock. Gu was given a suspended death sentence last year for killing Heywood and is likely to remain in jail for life. The on-going trial is exposing the greed, machinations and betrayal in one of China’s elite families. The 'Villa fontaine Saint-Georges' in Cannes, south-east France, which Gu's testimony claimed was a gift to her family from a corrupt businessman and at the centre of her dispute with Mr Heywood that led her to murder him . Bo, 64 , dismissed his estranged wife claims and called her a ‘crazy’ convicted killer. He . also disputed the state prosecution’s claim that the numerous gifts – . including rare African bush meat, flights, business deals and cash . payments - his family received amounted to bribes and he denied he had . provided any political favours in exchange for them. ‘Kailai has changed, she’s crazy, and she’s always making things up,' Bo told the court. ‘Under conditions where her mental state is abnormal, the investigators put her under immense pressure to expose me,’ he said. The . lurid details have a serious political side with the ruling Communist . Party using the trial to purge Bo, a charismatic and popular former . Politburo member tipped for high office. He . is expected to be found guilty in what many see as ‘show trial’ by the . authorities to show an increasingly critical public it is serious about . cracking down on rampant corruption among ruling party members. A screen shows Gu making her videotaped . testimony in which she says a businessman gave their family gifts . including a French villa, airline tickets and a Segway scooter. She was . convicted of murder in August last year . Heywood’s Chinese wife and their two young children remain in Beijing but refuse to discuss his death. His . mother, Ann Heywood, from south London, broke her silence last week, . issuing a statement calling on the Chinese authorities to show . ‘decisiveness and compassion’ over the family’s request to seek . financial compensation. She . said she was disappointed that Beijing had so far failed to give the . family any response despite  ‘repeated discreet approaches’.","Claims emerge in videotaped testimony of Heywood's killer Gu Kailai .

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . Tasmanian hoteliers have been advised to offer Chinese tourists free underwear, cup noodles, disposable slippers and 'fancy' condoms. The booklet of recommendations was released by the Tasmanian Hospitality Association as a 'practical guide' to help get businesses 'China ready'. The 16-page pamphlet, funded by the state government and launched on Monday, provides information that will ensure all operators maximise their opportunities whilst also providing high-quality visitor experiences, THA general manager Steve Old said. The booklet was released by the Tasmanian Hospitality Association on Monday to help get businesses 'China ready' 'It's about just understanding the very basic needs of a Chinese guest and understanding that they might not react in the same that we do,' Mr Old told the ABC. 'So it's about putting it to the simplest terms for any operator...to be able to understand their needs.' Other recommendations include free souvenirs, children's toys and unrefrigerated bottled water. The booklet also warns restaurateurs that Chinese diners can be 'noisy' and 'prone to back-slapping'. Tasmania's Premier and Tourism Minister, Will Hodgman, says there has been a 50 per cent increase in Chinese nationals arriving in Tasmania in the last 12 months to March this year . 'We're getting almost 20,000 Chinese visitors coming into Tasmania now, and there's no doubt that that's going to increase,' he told the ABC. Author Bob Priestley says the information published in the booklet is based on extensive research. He added that the Chinese hospitality industry was very attentive to the needs of their guests. 'When I got to China, they fuss over me. If I go to a Chinese restaurant, they fuss over me, they want me to have a good time,' he said. Mr Hodgman said the state government is committed to a target of attracting 1.5 million visitors to Tasmania per year by 2020, which would hopefully create up to 8,000 new jobs.","A 16-page booklet was released by the Tasmanian Hospitality Association on Monday .

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . Mark Tucker had no intentions of publishing his deepest and darkest thoughts. The Melbourne father of two merely penned his emotionally churning divorce as a cathartic experience. It was one particular moment, seven years ago, that turned his world upside down. The night he opened a message from his wife's phone which confirmed his biggest fears. Mark Tucker - author of Single Father, Better Dad - pictured with his youngest daughter Annabel . Daughters Annabel, Sophie, Mr Tucker and his new wife Alison . 'Goodnight my love,' the message read. Mr Tucker's 17 years of marriage was over after the discovery of these three words. 'I felt sick and light headed,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mark Tucker's first book documents his struggle through divorce and becoming a better father . 'I suspected a little because she had been withdrawn for a few months so when I found the message from another man on her phone, it confirmed my fears. 'It was a tough discovery and I didn’t know what was going to happen next.' The 51-year-old thought he had the perfect family and it had never crossed his mind that he may once become a single father. 'I was the bloke who went to work to earn money for the family and I was quite happy with that role,' he said. 'My then wife had her traditional role and I had mine.' After a devastating confrontation, he made the heartbreaking decision of divorce when his wife left him for another man. 'Emotionally it took me three months to really get a grip that this was the way it was going to be,' Mr Tucker said. 'I had hoped that maybe she would come back but at the same time, I wasn't sure that was going to have a good outcome.' He took on the role of being the prime parent to his two daughters Sophie and Annabel, who at the time were aged 14 and 12. But he soon came to a daunting realisation that he hadn't been the best father to his girls. Daughters Sophie, 21, and Annabel, 19, decided to live with their father after the divorce . A younger Annabel (left), with her older sister Sophie, on her first day of high school . 'I thought I was close with the girls,' he said. 'But going through the divorce, I had connected with the two girls on an emotional level like I'd never done before. 'I'm not saying I'm a perfect father now but I think I've become a better father and I think my children would say the same.' Then came the moment of truth. 'I had no idea about running a house which made me reflect on how much I wasn't involved in the process beforehand,' he said. 'I was so inefficient when it came to running a house – it took me half an hour to just find the iron and some nights I would finish the house work at 9.30pm. 'But we [daughters] bonded through that as a team and I started building a close relationship with them.' And it's the love for his daughters that still connects him with his ex-wife. 'We do talk and we're civil with each other because I feel it's the best way for me to deal with it all,' Mr Tucker said. 'Although our relationship is fractured, our death do us part vows still apply even when we're divorced because we're bound by our children – whether we like it or not.' Mr Tucker remarried four years ago. He became a husband to Alison and a father to her sons . Mark Tucker (middle) with his blended family in fancy dress . Mr Tucker starting writing his book two years after the divorce which was around the time he found love again. A year later, he remarried and became a husband to Alison and her two sons. Having survived his divorce, he hopes his book will help encourage other men in similar situations to embrace single parenting. 'When I look back, I've grown as a person and in some ways it's been a great opportunity,' he said. 'It's important for men to take a chance and I was determined at the time to show people that I could do it.' Mr Tucker believes that unfortunately in this day and age, men are 'getting the raw deal when it comes to divorce or separation'. 'My view is that women are better placed in divorce because there's more acceptance about women being the prime parent,' he said. 'There is a gernal perception that men are unable to cope with raising a family on their own and the working arrangements are better for women than men. 'People were puzzled as to why I had the children but really, men are just as entitled to share the care for their children.' Mr Tucker's final message in his book reflects the good life he's been able to achieve, despite the trauma of his divorce. 'There is no magic want that you can wave to make yourself a successful single father,' he wrote. 'Your new job is a simple one. It is to be the best dad that you can be and to give your children the best life that you possibly can. 'The most important thing is to stay strong and work on it day by day.' Single Father, Better Dad will be released on August 21.","Mark Tucker discovered his wife was having an affair when he saw a message from another man .

"By . Emily Crane . and Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . Australian senator Eric Abetz has been slammed after citing 1950s research to claim a link between breast cancer and abortion. He made the comments during a television interview on Thursday night when he was asked whether he believed the 'factually incorrect' statement that abortions can lead to breast cancer. 'I think the studies, and I think they date back from the 1950s, assert that there is a link between abortion and breast cancer,' Mr Abetz told Channel Ten's The Project. Such claims weren't far from those made by a Queensland politician two months ago, who said an abortion increases a woman's chance of breast cancer by as much as 44 per cent. Mr Abetz has tried to deny that he suggested a link between abortions and breast cancer on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Australian senator Eric Abetz made the comments during a television interview on Thursday night when he was asked whether he believed the 'factually incorrect' statement that abortions can lead to breast cancer . When Mr Abetz  was told the statement was 'conclusively and scientifically incorrect' he said: 'There are other organisations (apart from the Australian Medical Association) that have differing views'. 'I confess that I don’t have scientific expertise,'' he added. The Australian Medical Association President Associate Professor Brian Owler said the senator had 'cherry-picked' old information skewed toward an anti-abortion ideology. He said the comments were not based on current or conventional medical evidence. 'I just don't understand why a senior member of government would want to try to take on this issue and put himself out in the media using articles I'm told are from the 1950s as the basis of his discussion,' Professor Owler told AAP. Twitter erupted after Mr Abetz's comments aired with many slamming him for his views . Broede Carmody tweeted this Simpson's parody in reaction to Mr Abetz's comments . When Mr Abetz was told the statement was 'conclusively and scientifically incorrect' he said there were other organisations other than the Australia Medical Association that had different views . 'This is a serious issue and it should be discussed on the basis of current medical evidence.' Prof Owler said he respected freedom of speech but Senator Abetz's comments came with significant responsibility because of his senior government role. 'Let's not use false evidence or try and link abortion with other things such as breast cancer, I don't think it's fair and it's certainly not fair to people who may have experienced breast cancer,' he said. Two months ago, Liberal National Party member Freya Ostapovitch told the Queensland parliament 'the more induced abortions a woman had, the greater her risk of breast cancer'. Queensland MP Freya Ostapovitch told parliament in June that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer . 'Why are women not informed of these basic facts so that they can avoid induced abortions and thus lower their risk of breast cancer, the major cause of death other than road accidents for pre-menopausal women and the third major cause of death for post-menopausal women?' she said in parliament. Ms Ostapovitch, previously a psychiatric nurse, cited Chinese researcher Dr Yubei Huang who last year released a controversial paper arguing that induced abortions raised the risk of breast cancer by 44 per cent. She said she hoped her speech would raise awareness of 'some real ways a woman can prevent contracting breast cancer'. The morning after Mr Abetz's television interview, the senator has said his views have been misrepresented. 'Media reports that I have drawn or believe there is a link between abortion and breast cancer are incorrect,' he said on Friday. Mr Abetz further stated that he 'studiously avoided' suggesting a link between abortion and breast cancer, saying that he was 'cut off' before he was able to acknowledge that American Dr Angela Lanfranchi's views on this topic were not the accepted medical view. Dr Lanfranchi is a breast cancer surgeon and a clinical assistant professor of surgery who also supports the controversial claims. 'As I pointed out, I am associating myself with the Families Conference, the broad aims of which I support. This does not mean that I endorse the views of every single speaker.' But he also acknowledged Dr Lanfranchi's professional history in his statement, noting she was the surgical co-director of the Sanofi-Aventis Breast Care Centre and the Steeplechase Cancer Centre in New Jersey. He said Dr Lanfranchi had the right to free speech in Australia and the AMA had the right to disagree with her. Mr Abetz, who is the Employment Minister and leader of the government in the upper house, will host a lunch later this month in Melbourne as part of the World Congress of Families event . Mr Abetz, who is openly anti-abortion, has spoken out about his support for the WCF for their traditional views on families . Mr Abetz, who is the Employment Minister and leader of the government in the upper house, will host a lunch later this month in Melbourne as part of the World Congress of Families (WCF) event. One of the main speakers at the event promotes the idea that abortions can lead to breast cancer. Other ideas to be discussed by members of the WCF include that the pill can cause lethal infections and if you're on the pill it can lead to violent relationships. Mr Abetz, who is openly anti-abortion, has spoken out about his support for the WCF for their traditional views on families. 'My support for the WCF is based on the basic beliefs that they support the traditional view of marriage and that they are pro-life,' he said. 'The World Congress believes the best family unit… is a biological mother and biological father in a marriage relationship. 'What this congress is doing is bringing together a lot of academics and other experts around the world to exchange ideas.'","Senator Eric Abetz was asked whether he believed the 'factually incorrect' statement during a television interview on Thursday .

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . An Australian Christian Democratic Party Senator has made an embarrassing error after uploading a picture he believed to be the execution of an innocent Iraqi Christian when it was in fact a convicted Iranian murderer.

The photos showed a young man smiling as he was led to the gallows before the stand beneath him was kicked away.

While Senator Nile has since deleted his tweet about the execution and later acknowledged his mistake . 'How one Christian faced death at the hands of ISIS,' Rev Nile wrote on Twitter. 'He was already in Jesus' arms. Psalms 23:4 #saved.' But the pictured man wasn't what Rev Nile claimed him to be. Majid Kavoosifar was a murderous Iranian who, along with his cousin and uncle, was executed for killing a prominent Iranian judge in 2007. Daily Mail reported the execution seven years ago, when the unrepentant and smirking 28-year-old was led to the gallows and even manged a small wave to the crowd before his death. Flanked by masked hangmen, hoods over the heads of the condemned men were removed before the hanging, which took place in front of a giant portrait of the judge they had killed. While Senator Nile has since deleted his tweet, he acknowledged his mistake by posting: 'I'm not infallible...but please also report on the very REAL atrocities occurring in Iraq'.

"By . James Gordon . Daniel Boulud, one of New York’s most celebrated Michelin-starred chefs has been coming up short when it comes to paying his servers their appropriate wages and tips. A multimillion-dollar class action lawsuit accuses the celebrity chef of pocketing the gratuities from private events held at his restaurants, and forcing servers to perform non-tipped work on the side. The extra work sees them paid at the same low rate as if they were waiting tables and includes menial tasks such as cleaning bathrooms, taking out the garbage and vacuuming floors. Usually, a worker performing such tasks would be paid at a higher rate of $8-an-hour (the minimum wage), but they instead receive only $5 an hour for tipped work. Sneaky chef: Chef Daniel Boulud has an international food empire that includes more than a dozen restaurants and nearly as many cookbooks, yet a lawsuit alleges he has found ways to pay servers less than they are entitled . Mr. Boulud’s troubles highlight a pervasive problem in the restaurant industry. While high-end restaurants  are dependent on immigrant labor, and many of those workers have advanced, most find themselves cornered in lower-paying jobs. The plaintiffs are servers, Edison Lopez, Carlos Cruz Cacildo and Justin Wands. The trio are confident that their lawsuit will stand. 'Daniel is one of the best restaurants, not only in New York or the US, but in the world,' the servers’ attorney Brian Schaffer told the New York Post. Sous chef! Daniel Boulud faces a multimillion-dollar lawsuit that claims he stiffed his servers on wages and tips . 'Workers deserve to be treated fairly,' he said, and estimated the pool of plaintiffs could eventually reach 500. The servers are seeking unspecified damages for tips and wages going back to 2008. During that time, the French chef has earned heaps of accolades, including coveted Michelin stars, yet none of the glory is passed down to those who work to keep the restuarant running on a daily basis. Meanwhile, customers pay up to $220 for a prix-fixe tasting menu at a number of Mr Boulud's restaurants. Some servers have already spoken out about the unfair payments. Graciela Roman worked as a busser at Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud between 2007 and 2012. She says she spent much of her shift doing 'side work' such as sweeping and taking out garbage. However while she was doing that, she 'was wrongfully paid the lower, tipped-credit minimum wage rate, rather than the non-tipped minimum wage.' Eponymous: Daniel, his flagship New York City namesake, was awarded three Michelin stars in the 2010 Michelin, the book's highest rating. In January of 2013, Daniel NYC was inducted into Culinary Hall of Fame . Ms.Roman also claims she was 'required to engage in a tip distribution scheme' and that she was not compensated for overtime work. Although the federal Fair Labor Standards Act does allow employers to pay their workers a lower minimum wage if those employees receive tips, the law requires that the employee’s wages and tips combined must equal at least the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour . If the employee does not receive enough tips to reach the standard minimum wage, the employer is required to provide the employee with sufficient wages to make up the rest. According to the lawsuit, 'The Boulud restaurants have a corporate policy or practice of minimizing labor costs by unlawfully taking a tip credit against the minimum wage rate'. It is an unfortunate fact that, in efforts to cut costs by businesses, employees are often the ones who suffer the consequences. On the line: The servers are seeking unspecified damages for tips and wages going back to 2008 . There are laws in place, though, to prevent employers from taking advantage of their employees. The wage and hour class action lawsuit was filed against the chef in 2012. In 2013 Boulud tried to end the proceedings by denying Roman’s allegations but the judge denied Boulud’s request saying that the case was too fact-intensive and could not be rushed. Earlier this year, Boulud chose to settle the lawsuit (which is separate, yet similar in nature). The chef continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong and that no laws were broken in any of his restaurants. The settlement covers about ninety employees who worked as servers in several of Boulud’s restaurants in New York and were paid the lower minimum wage of employees who allegedly should be receiving tips. Boulud, one of the world's most . respected chefs, has written numerous cookbooks and presides over a . fleet of restaurants stretching from New York and Miami to London and . Asia. His New York City restaurant Daniel, now 20 years old, holds a coveted three Michelin stars.","Servers who should have been waiting on customers were instead doing other menial tasks such as sweeping or taking out the trash .

He said his aunt Cynthia raised him and had sent him a loving text message the night before her death. 'She was the sweetest lady. She even took care of my own daughter for a while, and she was praying for Junior,' Bueno, 25, said, placing a hand over his pregnant wife's belly.

"By . James Gordon . A five-month-old male orangutan has been sent to the Milwaukee County Zoo to try and find a suitable surrogate mother after failing to bond with his real mom. Little Kecil rejected his birth mother after he was born in January at the Toledo Zoo in Ohio. Officials there placed the baby primate with a surrogate and chose a female who already had experience in such a role. There's a new orangutan at the Milwaukee County Zoo. Four-month-old Kecil arrived at the zoo on  May 19. He came from the Toledo Zoo because he could not bond with his mother. The Zoo has an excellent track record with successful orangutans births in the past, but on this occasion, the mother simply didn't want to get to know her offspring. Yasmin has raised her own offspring in the past, she experienced a difficult delivery and had shown little interest in caring for the baby. The Zoo’s keepers and veterinary team worked tirelessly to offer mom Yasmin and the baby private, off-exhibit quarters in Toledo, in the hopes that they would bond but in the end it was decided he should be moved to Milwaukee. 'This baby’s well-being has been a priority since he was born, and we feel it is of utmost importance that he is raised by one of his own species,' Jeff Sailer, the Zoo’s executive director, said. 'Every orangutan matters; this is an endangered species that could go extinct in the wild during this baby’s lifetime.' M.J. was the surrogate mother for Mahal, a baby orangutan who was brought to Milwaukee in 2008. Mahal died last December. A new bond: Baby Kecil is being moved from the Toledo zoo to Milwaukee where he will be cared for by M.J., a surrogate mother. (Pictured here, baby Kassiu, a gorilla who died last year and his mother Naku at Milwaukee Zoo) Kecil is the second baby ape to live at the Milwaukee County Zoo this year. The first was a female gorilla named Kassiu who was born in March but also died a month later. Kassiu was the first gorilla born in Milwaukee in 22 years. M.J. is considered a 'proven surrogate,' and she and Kecil slowly have been introduced to each other at the Milwaukee County Zoo. Kecil, which means 'little man' in Indonesian, is in good health and was accompanied to Milwaukee by one of his keepers from Toledo, who has remained at the zoo to work with a Milwaukee zookeeper to assist in the transition.","Kecil was born in January at a zoo in Ohio but his mom rejected him .

"By . James Gordon . When it comes to the Superbowl there can only ever be one winner, but that also means the 'winning' t-shirts from the losing side are destined for the trash. After the Seattle Seahawks' 43-8 victory over the Denver Broncos in February in New Jersey, thousands of Denver's 'Super Bowl champions' souvenir t-shirts are about to be put to good use and sent off to Africa.

"By . Kirk Maltais . and James Gordon . A middle school history teacher who was suspended after teaching students about the use of blackface in entertainment during the 1800s has been allowed back into the classroom after a protest by parents and pupils. Alan Barron, 59, from Monroe, Michigan, was placed on paid administrative leave two weeks ago after an assistant principal at Monroe Middle School sat in on Barron's lesson about Jim Crow racial segregation laws. As part of the lesson, Barron showed the class a video about the use of blackface by white performers of the time to imitate African Americans. The administrator objected to the video, and Barron, a teacher for 36 years in Monroe, was suspended just weeks shy of his retirement. Back in play: Residents of Monroe, Michigan protested a decision by the school board to suspend history teacher Alan Barron after teaching a lesson about the use of blackface . Alan Barron, 59, was suspended two weeks ago for showing his class a video about the use of blackface in the entertainment of the 1800s . 'I have no words that can express my gratitude and thanks for the support you have shown toward me during this turbulent time of my career,' Mr. Barron said on his Facebook page. 'Each day I preach to my students far more than history. I preach about choices, commitment and community service as I try to practice what I teach.' Parents and students were outraged at Mr Barron's suspension with almost everyone defending his character as well as his choice of lesson plan. 'She was more offended that they stopped the video,' Adrienne Aaron, mother to one of the students in the classroom said about her daughter's reaction to seeing the video. 'It had nothing to do with racism.' said Mrs Aaron, whose husband is African American. 'History is history. We need to educate our kids to see how far we’ve come in America. How is that racism?' Many other students and parents took to Facebook to voice their dissatisfaction over Barron's suspension and it appears their voices have been heard.

"By . James Gordon . An eight-month-old baby girl from New Jersey has become the sixth infant in the country to die in a Nap Nanny Recliner. The child, from Hopatcong, was secured by a belt and was found partly hanging over the side of baby-napping device, trapped between the recliner and a crib bumper. The U.S. Consumer and Product Safety Commission is urging parents and caregivers to stop using the Nap Nanny and Nap Nanny Chill Recliners immediately as a result of the girl’s death, although the item was recalled last summer. Dangerous: This doll is used to show the danger posed to babies by Nap Nanny and Nap Nanny Chill recliners . The prduct was pulled from shelves last June after 92 incidents, including five infant deaths dating back to 2009. The recall was voluntary, however. The Nap Nanny was designed to mimic the curves of a baby car seat, elevating an infant slightly to help reduce reflux, gas, stuffiness or other problems. The dangers of the product are when the baby gets trapped or when the baby suffocates on the inside of the product. 'This is a product that should be out of homes and we urge all parents to stop using the product,' said U.S. Consumer and Product Safety Commission spokesman Scott Wolfson. Recalled: Baby Matters Nap Nanny Recliners due to falling, entrapment and suffocation risks that killed six babies (stock photo) Wolfson said before the recall, 165,000 units had been sold. The danger now comes on the second hand market. 'Don’t sell it at a garage sale. Don’t take it back to a local thrift store. Don’t put it on eBay or Craigslist. Just throw it away,' he said. Officials believe that parents and caregivers are still picking up the hazardous products from yard sales, online auction sites or using them as hand-me-down gifts. Parents should be aware that once a product is officially recalled, it is illegal to sell or resell them.The products were already voluntarily recalled at the end of 2012 by Amazon.com, Babies R Us, Buy Buy Baby, Diapers.com, and Toys R Us.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and James Gordon . Actor Jason Patric hurled anti-Semitic slurs at the mother of his child in public and hit her with a phone, according to his ex-girlfriend. Patric has been locked in a legal battle with Danielle Schreiber over the custody of their 4-year-old son, Gus, who was conceived through in-vitro fertilization. After initially being denied visitation rights under a puzzling California law that does not recognize the paternal rights of unmarried sperm donors, Patric scored a major legal victory. He said, she said: Danielle Schreiber (left) said Jason Patric (right) slammed her head agaisnt the wall, struck her with a phone receiver and called her 'Jew c***,'  but his lawyers insisted Schreiber's claims are false . Bitter fight: Patric's ex-girlfriend Danielle . Schreiber, seen in court earlier this month barred the actor from seeing their . son on the grounds that as a sperm donor, he has no parental rights . Last week, a California appeals court sided with the 47-year-old star of The Lost Boys, clearing the way for Patric to fight for legal recognition as Gus' father. The actor has been sitting down for TV interviews and recruiting his celebrity friends to promote his cause. But according to court documents filed by his ex-girlfriend, Danielle Schreiber, her son's biological father does not deserve public sympathy because he was verbally and physically abusive during their decade-long relationship. Schreiber claimed that Patric slammed her head against the wall, struck her with a telephone receiver and regularly called her 'Jew c***' and 'Ms Jew lawyer,' apparently referring to her prominent jurist father, TMZ reported. The woman's court filings stated that on one occasion, Patric went to their son's pre-school and addressed her in public as 'Ms Jew Schreiber.' Last November, Ms Schreiber obtained a restraining order against Patric prohibiting him from contacting her. The actor's attorney, Fred Silberberg, dismissed Schreiber’s allegations of anti-Semitism and physical abuse as 'categorically untrue.' ‘These disclosures are a last gasp attempt at disparaging Gus’ father ... [They] are desperate comments from a desperate woman,' he told TMZ. The attorney hit back at the woman, noting that if her claims were true, she would not have spent years living with Patric and undergoing fertility treatments to conceive a baby with him. Legal battle: Actor Jason Patric (right) and his attorney Fred Silberberg (left) seen earlier this month. A California appeals court reverses a trial judge who wouldn't allow Patric as sperm donor to have any relationship with his in vitro son . On her part, Schreiber said through . her attorney, Patty Glaser, that like many victims of domestic violence, . it took her a long time to realize that she does not have to accept her . mistreatment. ‘The fact . that the domestic violence restraining order was issued after a family . court judge heard Ms. Schreiber's and Mr. Patric's testimony speaks for . itself,’ said Glaser. Patric . biologically fathered Gus with his former girlfriend in 2010 and . conceived the child via in-vitro fertilization after their separation, . co-parenting for more than a year before they split permanently. In February 2013, the actor lost a court . battle to gain visitation rights with Gus under a state law that . grants the mother full custody in the absence of a written agreement . establishing the sperm donor's parental rights before conception. At an earlier court hearing it was said that because Patric donated his sperm, he was classified as a 'sperm donor' and had no parental rights since he and Schreiber were not married at the time of the baby's conception. In addition, Patric never signed a birth certificate, Schreiber said. In a statement to ABC News, Schreiber said Patric offered to donate sperm after the two broke up 'under the express condition' that it be kept secret and 'that he would not be a father to or have any obligations, rights or responsibilities for my child.' A judge at the earlier court hearing agreed and Patric was barred from seeing Gus. Last week's ruling means that Patric is legally entitled to seek paternity rights in court. Happier times: The Lost Boys star and his former girlfriend, pictured here on a family beach vacation, agreed to conceive a baby together in 2009 when they were already separated . Daddy's little boy: Patric, 47, seen with Gus in Hawaii a few years ago, says he has been a real father to the boy from the day of his birth . California appeals court judge Thomas Willhite said that the presumption against in-vitro fathers shouldn't be 'so categorical,' and that the family law code 'does not preclude a donor from establishing that he is a presumed father.' Patric and Schreiber, who had dated off and on for about 10 years, split for good in June 2012. He filed a paternity claim shortly thereafter. The actor has been forbidden by Schreiber, who currently is the sole legal parent, from seeing Gus for more than a year. Ms . Schreiber, 41, a massage therapist and the daughter of a prominent . Connecticut lawyer, said her on-again, off-again boyfriend never signed . their son's birth certificate. Moreover, the woman said in a statement to ABC News . that Patric offered to help her conceive a child through in-vitro . fertilization under the express condition that his sperm donation be . kept secret, and that he would have no parental rights or obligations. A judge in a lower court sided with the mother, striping Patric of visitation rights. The former teen heartthrob, however, insisted that he has been a father to Gus from the day of his birth. His lawyers will argue that the actor signed forms at the family planning clinic promising 'an intent to parent.' Bad breakup: In 2012, the couple's relationship came to an end, and shorty after Schreiber barred Patric from seeing Gus . Speaking to ABC News earlier this month, Patric said the last time he saw his son was 63 weeks ago – even though he lives only 10 minutes away. ‘I said, “It's OK. I'll see you tomorrow.” I've never seen him again,’ he recalled. Mr Patric is seeking full custody of little Gus in a high-profile case that has raised serious questions about the parental rights of sperm donors. Last week, Patric scored a minor legal victory when a judge citing the First Amendment declined to grant Schreiber a restraining order in order to prevent her ex-boyfriend from using their son's name in an advocacy group he had created called 'Stand Up for Gus,' according to The Hollywood Reporter. Patric’s public campaign has gained some traction in Hollywood, with A-listers like Mark Wahlberg, Chris Rock, Jon Hamm and Mel Gibson lending their support to the cause. The 47-year-old actor, who is the grandson of The Honeymooners star Jackie Gleason, has spent the past year going around giving interviews and speaking out about the rights of sperm donors at fundraisers for his foundation. Last July, Patric sat down with Katie Couric for an interview about his legal battle, telling the TV presenter that Gus was stolen from him because of an outdated legal stature that does not recognize the parental rights of sperm donors in those cases where the mother and father are no longer together. Activist: Patric (right), pictured with friend Carol Chodroff following a custody hearing earlier this month, has started a foundation called Stand Up for Gus to push for a new law recognizing the parental rights of sperm donors . Patric and Schreiber first met in 2002 when he came to her for a massage and struck up a romance, The New York Times reported. In 2009, the Sleepers star offered his on-again, off-again girlfriend to help her conceive a child through in-vitro fertilization. Gus’ birth had initially helped the couple rebuild their rocky relationship, but three years later they broke up for good, and soon after the actor says he was abruptly barred from having contact with his son. On her part, Schreiber said during an interview on NBC's Today Show last July that Patric doesn't deserve any rights to Gus. 'It's not about him having a relationship or contact with Gus. This is just about rights,' she said. 'Me preserving my right to be a sole legal parent, not having to share that with someone who has never intended to and never raised Gus, even when we were dating — Jason never did anything to raise Gus. He never changed a single diaper,' she said. But Patric - who refers to himself as Gus’ ‘Dada’ online – continues to insists that he has been a real father to the toddler, even taking him to be circumcised when he was eight days old.","Danielle Schreiber, 41, stated in court documents that Jason Patric hurled anti-Semitic insults at her and slammed her head against the wall .

"By . James Gordon . A newly married couple from Florida ended up calling on a few favors from staff at a waste dump after accidentally throwing away their wedding rings . Saira Rossy from Naples had only been married a few days. She was taking out the trash and simply didn’t realize that her wedding and engagement rings were in a small Ziploc bag next to an empty pizza box. In her rush to get to work, she ended up throwing them down the garbage chute but she didn't for several hours that the ring was actually missing. Scroll down for video... Throwaway love: Newlywed Saira Rossy ended up calling on a few favors from staff at a waste dump after accidentally throwing away her wedding rings . A nice sparkler: Saira Rossy had only been married a few days and was running late for work when ended up throwing away her wedding rings along with the trash . Long road to freedom: The trash wound its way down the garbage chute along with the rest of the household garbage leading directly to a 20-foot-long and 8-foot-wide trash compactor . Helping hand: Waste Management assured her they could help . 'I called my mom to see if I had left it in the bathroom and it hit me — oh my God, I threw out my wedding ring,' Mrs Rossy said to NBC 2 News. Mrs Rossy got married at the start of May and would take her wedding ring set off while she was at work to keep it safe. Somehow, before her ring made it into her purse for safekeeping, the engagement ring and wedding band wound up on the table next to an old pizza box. Before long, it was winding its way down the garbage chute along with the rest of the household trash leading directly to a 20-foot-long and 8-foot-wide trash compactor. In a hurry: Saira Rossy didn;t realize what was in the small Ziploc bag next to an empty Little Caesar;s Pizza box when she dropped it down the garbage chute in her rush to work . Needle in a haystack: Waste Management emptied five tons of trash from the compactor and went digging for the rings . Suited & booted: She made a quick stop at the store; Rossy bought a hazmat suit, mask and boots. She was ready to go Dumpster diving . Found! Dennis Sierra, a driver with Waste Management, found the rings - they were still in their ziplocked bag . After realizing her gut-wrenching mistake, Mrs Rossy called the building manager but he was on vacation. 'I was frantic,' Rossy said. 'I called Waste Management to see if they would let me open it up and look inside, but they understandably said it was too much of a liability — that it was too toxic and it could crush me.' Eventually. Christi Epperson, a manager at Waste Management told her that although they couldn’t open up the trash compactor, they might be able to take a look inside when it was hauled off a week later to be emptied at the landfill. Very few people were involved in the actual search. Recovered: Sierra who looked inside a nearly empty bag with a pizza box on top. He pulled apart every piece of junk mail inside until a tiny plastic bag with a wedding ring inside fell out . The couple even stopped throwing garbage down the chute so there would be fewer bags to sort through. 'It was kind of tragic for us, because we just got married and it was such a large expense,' Mrs Rossy said. 'I really was already thinking there was no way they were going to find it.' On 'dump day', five tons of garbage filled the container and Mrs Rossy together with  Ms Epperson and Dennis Sierra, a driver with Waste Management, were ready to start looking for the ring. The search was done mostly by sight because of the risk of encountering needles and broken glass. Mrs Rossy knew she had to look out for a white trash bag carrying a Little Caesar’s Pizza box. Driver, Mr Sierra looked inside a nearly empty bag with a pizza box on top and found a tiny plastic bag with a wedding ring inside. Mrs Rossy bought the two employees $50 gift cards to a restaurant as a thank you. 'I didn’t know what else to do,' Rossy said. 'It’s just so nice that a company would do this, they were extraordinary to do this.'","Newly wedded wife  ended up throwing away her wedding rings along with the trash .

"By . James Gordon . Just as you <iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/LJlbDBJmavE"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>thought enthusiasm over Disney's Frozen was about to thaw, the company has announced the phenomenon is to be turned into a live show, performed fittingly, on-ice. The film is to be re-imagined for a touring show set to open in the US this September. Frozen is sixth biggest box office hit in the history of cinema, with approximately $1.3bn in worldwide box office sales. Let it go! Disney will expand the reach of Frozen, the highest-grossing animated picture of all time, by bringing it to ice. The film is to be reimagined for a touring show set to open in this September . The action adventure involves . Princess Anna teaming up with co-stars Sven the reindeer and Olaf the . snowman to find her estranged sister Elsa, whose icy powers have . inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. The arena tour which will travel throughout the U.S. in 2014 and 2015, will begin at the home of Disney in Orlando. The show, produced by Feld Entertaiment, will mark the first time the characters of sisters Anna and Elsa will be appearing in a live production. The plot will closely follow the magical story that is portrayed in the film, set in the Kingdom of Arendelle. Quite the spectacle: The On-Ice show will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting . The experience won't be short on special effects either with the producers simulating a blizzard created by 20 snow machines, a stage inspired by a six-sided snowflake and towering video projection panels that will recreate the movie’s jagged North Mountains. There will also be live performances of the soundtrack's greatest hits, including Let It Go. The show will be hosted by Mickey and Minnie Mouse, with guest appearances by other Disney princesses and characters from Toy Story, Finding Nemo and The Lion King, the company said. The tour will also have six different versions trekking through the country between 2014 and 2015, with nine traveling overseas. After opening in Orlando, the Frozen tour will travel to cities including Tampa, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Newark, New Jersey. The show will have several performances in New York at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn in November. The 'immersive experience' will include a set that incorporates not only the ice surface, but the air above it, with snow machines, video projections and other special effects and a large cast of ice skaters. 'Our goal is to showcase these heartwarming characters in a way that allows the audience to cheer and sing along throughout this emotional journey,' director Patty Vincent said. Disney on Ice shows are usually made up of short segments from various Disney films. However, because Frozen's story already involves ice, the show will be 98 per cent based on Elsa and her princess sister, Anna and their pals. Mixed: Although critics were not such big fans of the film, the story has been a huge hit for children and their parents! Big production: The Disney on Ice production will feature 39 skaters and will tour around the country . Disney has been moving quickly to capitalize on the massive success of Frozen, which won two Academy Awards and has taken in more than $1.2 billion worldwide since its release in November. The soundtrack has sold more than 2.7 million copies in the United States alone, and DVD and digital download sales have been among the best Hollywood has ever seen. Despite a lukewarm critical response, . the film won two Oscars, and its songs, penned by Broadway duo Robert . Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, topped the US Billboard 200 chart for . 13 consecutive weeks. There has . also been a huge demand for toys and costumes associated with the film . such as Elsa's shimmering blue dress or Anna's caped ensemble. See it live! All the characters from the film will be included in the live On-Ice show which opens in September . Demand . became so high both sides of the Atlantic that Disney started selling . out as stock ran low and even had to impose quotas on some of the . merchandise to create an 'equitable way' to buy the most popular stuffed . animals and dolls. Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that a live Broadway musical version is currently in production alongside concepts for theme park rides. 'This is definitely up there in terms of our top, probably, five franchises,' Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told analysts in response to questions about how long Frozen fever could last. 'So you can expect us to take full advantage of that over the next five years, I would guess,' he said. Latest production: The company have produced 34 On-Ice shows such as this one from The Lion King .","A touring version of Frozen is scheduled to launch in September .

"By . James Gordon . With prices for limes as high as $1.50 this year because of a lime shortage in the U.S., margarita, gin & tonic drinkers and even guacamole lovers will be relieved to hear that prices are on their way back down. America's limes are imported almost exclusively from Mexico, and whilst the demand never ceased, they became increasingly hard to come by with some bars and restaurants resorting to lemons or simply forgoing the citrus fruit altogether. 40-pound boxes of limes which were commanding $35 are now closer to $6 a box. Now that the price is dropping once again, Mexican farmers couldn't be happier. Reduced: A shortage in Mexico, where 97 per cent of the U.S.'s  limes are produced caused prices to skyrocket.  At one stage prices for a single lime were as much as $1.50 but last week they were closer to 30 cents . Lime crime: The Knights Templar drug cartel in Michoacan, Mexico has been raiding lime groves and hijacking farmer's trucks. Above, vigilantes have organized to fight the cartel . Last week the U.S. Department of Agriculture said consumers paid on average 30 cents a lime, compared with 90 a few months ago. Some, like Mexican chains like Rosa Mexicano decided to take the hit hoping the shortage would pass. 'I . can tell you this time last year we were paying approximately $36 a . case,' manager Jay Holmes said. 'At one stage, the cases were costing us . $110 a case.' Across the border, in . the outdoor wholesale lime market in Apatzingan, Michoacan in Mexico, . dozens stand in line waiting for the pick-up trucks to pull up with the . fruit which is known is green gold. Alternatives: The shortage caused some restaurants and bars to charge more for lime-based drinks, or substitute with lemons. Above limes are sorted in Mihoacan, Mexico last November . 'The trucks barely stop and the limes are sold ... they're selling like hotcakes,' Geraldo Fernandez, a lime buyer told NPR. Mexico's lime-producing states like Veracruz took a beating after bad weather and a fungal outbreak earlier this year. However the orchards in Michoacan ended up making record profits. Recent improved weather and a decent spring crop means supplies are almost back to normal. The farmers of Michoacan aren't complaining about the price drop as they are still enjoying their record profits. A weight appears to have been lifted because they are no longer at the mercy of Mexico's ruthless drug cartels. For . more than a decade, at one stage every part of the lime business was . controlled by one drug gang or another. The last few seasons have been . controlled by the Knights Templar cartel. Lime farmers reported that . cartel members would raid their groves and hijack delivery trucks. Many growers refused to even send their trucks on the road. Winners and losers: One man has took advantage of the shortage by driving a U-Haul truck to and from Florida and selling limes at New York restaurants and bars. Above a man unloads a truck-load full of Mexican limes at a packing plant in Michoacan . 'You'd make the money and they would take it, they charged so-called taxes, quotas on everything,' says Efrain Hernandez. The . drug gang would made specific demands on the farmers telling them where . and when they could sell their crops and even at what price. They cartel would then take 10 per cent of the profits which would be as much as $2,000 a week. Now, the federal police have begun a crackdown in the state. Several top leaders of the cartel have been killed or arrested. Three mayors and a former governor of Michoacan were arrested on charges of colluding with organized crime. But . now everything appears to be green and the farmers are once again enjoying the fruits of . their labor as they swap their 'green gold' for greenbacks from . across the border.","Heavy rains in Mexico caused a large loss of the lime crop this year, which was already plagued by disease .

"By . Michael Zennie . The next generation fighter plane isn't the F-35 or any jet being developed by China, Russia, or any air force in the world. It's a stealth drone, armed with a laser cannon and outfitted with a computer capable of thinking on its own and learning - and it'll be able to beat any pilot who's ever lived. A U.S. Air Force captain who specializes in flying drones has devised new concept drone for the American military that could  revolutionize air-to-air combat by removing human beings from cockpits and replacing them with cold machines that are capable of making millions of flight adjustments a second. Time will tell whether the 'FQ-X' will prove to be the future aerial dog-fighting or a flash in the pan - or even the harbinger of an android apocalypse like the Terminators and Battlestar Galactica Cylons from science fiction. Concept: Rough mock-ups of the FQ-X drone fighter, which can think and act on its own, show a small, fast, light aircraft capable of out-maneuvering and out-thinking the enemy . The FQ-X would be armed either with a cannon or lasers - not guided missiles as is the standard for today's modern fighter aircraft . No matter what, Capt Michael W. Byrnes says, the technology is closer than most people think. In an article published in the Air & Space Power Journal this summer, Capt Byrnes makes his case that most of the technologies required for such a drone fighter are already in existence - they just have to be fine-tuned to make the FQ-X. He also builds the case that no matter what arguments human pilots make about adaptability and the complex tasks required to win a dogfight, they will always lose to a perfect computer-aided drone. Captain Michael W. Byrnes imagines a deadlier air force - without pilots . 'Humans average 200-300 milliseconds to react to simple stimuli, but machines can select or synthesize and execute maneuvers, making millions of corrections in that same quarter of a second,' Capt Byrnes writes. 'Every step (in dog-fighting tactics) that we can do, they will do better.' The analysis is based on the time-honored approach to combat called 'Observe, Orient, Decide, Act' (OODA) - which means pilots must observe the situation, process those observations, decide on a course of action and then act. However, following those steps to their logical conclusions means that 'machines will inevitably outfly human pilots,' Capt Byrnes writes. The FQ-X that Capt Byrnes has devised is small, fast and light. It relies on radar-obscuring stealth skin to allow it to get close to its targets. A sophisticated computer would be able to tell the different between friend and foe and process how to maneuver in combat. The computer would also be able to learn from tactics of enemy pilots and make adjustments in millionths of a second. Finally, an armament of cannon rounds - or a high-intensity laser - would eliminate the opposition before enemy pilots have a chance to react. Military futurists have for decades been predicting that unmanned fighters would replace pilots in the sky. The U.S. military has already begun using drones - piloted by trained airmen thousands of miles away - for many surveillance missions. Drones with air-to-ground missile have also famously been used to kill combatants in some of the world's most remote and inhospitable regions. But the technology still requires a human to guide the controls. Unmanned and deadly: Drones already carry out missile strikes on targets around the world. Pictured here is an MQ-9 Reaper armed with air-to-ground missiles . Capt Byrnes acknowledges that his of a thinking killer machine is the stuff of science fiction nightmares - like Battlestar Galactica's Cylons . Capt Byrnes said artificial intelligence that could eliminate the pilot altogether is already in development. In 2008, an MIT researcher developed a computer brain that performed basic fighter maneuvers in a flight test lab. According to Capt Byrnes, it was able to 'learn' how to fly into a kill position - rather than the moves being pre-programmed in. However, an autonomous drone need not operate without human input, he says. Commands could be worked into the programming to require human approval - and accountability -  at any step in combat. Even as the technology becomes closer to reality, Capt Byrnes acknowledges that human beings might not be ready to accept it. 'Aviators may dislike it, the public will question it, science fiction imagines harbingers of the Cylon apocalypse, and we are uncertain how to best utilize it within the context of the larger Air Force,' he writes. 'Nevertheless, the FQ-X concept is too dangerous to our current thinking to ignore forever.'","Captain Michael W. Byrnes has developed the concept for an FQ-X fighter that could - in theory - out-fly any pilot who's ever lived .
The autonomous drone would be able to make decisions - and even kill - without the direct intervention of a human being .
Capt Byrnes argues the idea is closer to becoming a reality than most people - including U.S. Air Force brass - realize ."

Conan O'Brien isn't usually at a loss for words, but he stammered and appeared visibly shaken on Monday night as he broke the news of Robin Williams death to his studio audience.

He said he didn't even realize the dog was there. Samano claimed that once he realized he dragged the dog, he left it behind because he was scared. He told the TV station that he just moved to the country and was afraid what would happen to him and his family if he brought the puppy to authorities.

"By . Michael Zennie . The 62-year-old serial stowaway who was arrested Monday night after she managed to fly from San Jose to Los Angeles without a ticket has claimed her plane-hopping days are over - despite seven previous arrests. After pleading no-contest to trespassing charges on Wednesday, Marilyn Hartman told reporters that she's sorry she sneaked through a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint and that it was a 'very stupid' thing to do. Hartman, who authorities say has a history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's been caught after successfully boarding a flight. Outside the Los Angeles Airport Court on Wednesday, she was cherry, talkative and engaging - despite her dire circumstances. Scroll down for video . Still smiling: Marilyn Hartman, 62, claimed she would never try to hop a plane again without a ticket - despite at least a half-dozen arrests for it this year alone . She was released from jail with the $4.25 in change that she had been carrying and directed to a nearby homeless shelter. A judge told her to stay away from airports. Court officials told her she could take a bus back to San Francisco. She's hopeful she can easily panhandle enough cash for a ticket. 'I think I've been on enough programs where people can recognize me. They might give me a dollar or two,' she told KNBC-TV. She said Wednesday that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said Wednesday that Hartman has no family and was never married. According to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the last few years. Busted: Hartman has been repeatedly picked up at San Francisco Airport for trespassing. She made it onto a plane one time - but was discovered before it took off . Prosecutors in San Francisco has declined to press charges against her after a half-dozen arrests. Authorities say she is mentally ill . She claims she was fired from her job as a legal secretary after she reported her boss for corruption. Records indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. According to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department. Hartman's antics - which previously targeted San Francisco International Airport - have made her something of a folk hero in the Bay Area. Hartman was only discovered when Southwest crew members counted the passengers left on the plane who were going to Phoenix, the final destination of the flight (stock image) On her first attempt, on February 15, she sneaked through TSA security and boarded a plane bound for Hawaii. She managed to take a seat on the flight - but was caught when the passenger who paid for a ticket in the seat showed up. She told police at the time that she had cancer - a claim that has not been substantiated - and that she wanted to go someplace warm. A Go Fund Me page set up by sympathetic San Franciscans has raised nearly $1,300 toward sending her legally on a Hawaiian vacation. The San Jose Mercury News reports that Hartman sneaked past the TSA agents check boarding passes while a family was being screened on Monday night. She had tried three times to get past the checkpoint unsuccessfully before she made it through. She then got into the security line and was screened for weapons like all other passengers. Once in the terminal, she tried unsuccessfully to board several planes before she was able to get aboard the Southwest Flight to Los Angeles. Southwest, unlike many other major airlines, does not have assigned seats - which could explain how she wasn't discovered until the plane landed at LAX. This is the second high-profile security breach at Mineta San Jose International Airport this year. In April, a 15-year-old boy scaled a fence and sneaked into the wheel-well of a Maui-bound plane. Incredibly, he survived the freezing temperatures for five-and-a-half hours and landed safely in Hawaii.","Marilyn Jean Hartman was arrested after landing in Los Angeles on Monday .

"By . Michael Zennie . Speaking out: Principal Amy Lacey has defended herself after her comments cause an uproar . A Texas principal who sparked national controversy after she told students at her heavily-Hispanic middle school to speak English in class claims she is being persecuted for following state education rules. Amy Lacey, who was fired as principal of Hempstead Middle School outside Houston in March, says that contrary to reports from students and teacher at her school, she never banned Spanish from campus when she made a school-wide announcement on the intercom last November. 'I informed students it would be best to speak English in the classrooms to the extent possible, in order to help prepare them for (state) tests,' she wrote in a letter to the Houston Chronicle. She added: 'It is important to note that I did not ban the use of Spanish anywhere in the school or at any time.' Speaking out for the first time, Mrs Lacey said it is state policy to teach English and the official language of the state of Texas is English. Her intent, she claims, was merely to encourage her students to use English more. She also blamed her students - who she says claimed racism when they were disciplined in class for speaking out of turn. '... (T)eachers had reported to me that they had experienced instances in which students had been asked to stop talking during instruction, and they responded that it was their right to speak Spanish -- ignoring the fact that they shouldn't have been speaking (in any language) during class without permission,' Mrs Lacey wrote in the Chronicle. 'The perception of the teachers was that students were being disrespectful and disrupting learning, and they believed they could get away with it by claiming racism.' Mrs Lacey lost her job over the comments, but she says she was just upholding state educational standards . Mrs Lacey's announcement drew ire from Hispanic activists around the country. Some claimed her public announcement may have kicked off a campaign to intimidate Hispanic in the school system, the Chronicle reports. There have even been calls for a federal Justice Department investigation. The case also sparked conversation about the role of Spanish is Texas schools. Half of Hempstead Middle School's students are Hispanic - on par with the state average. Mrs Lacey still maintains she did nothing wrong - or even controversial - and that the story was blow wildly out of proportion. 'When I was hired as principal of Hempstead Middle School, it was made clear to me that Hempstead Middle School was to be an ESL campus. My announcement was in accordance with board policy, as well as supporting the efforts of teachers to prepare our students to be successful,' she wrote.","Amy Lacey is speaking out for the first time since her announcement over an intercom last November became national news .

"By . Michael Zennie . A sightseer who tried to get a close-up view of one of Yellowstone's most well-known attractions could end up damaging it for years to come after he crashed a drone into the 160-degree waters. The Grand Prismatic Spring owes its brilliant array of colors to a delicate balance of bacteria and algae mixing with special minerals in the harsh environment. Park officials fear that the drone, which plunked into the steaming cauldron last Saturday, might upset that balance. Furthermore, going into 120-foot-deep spring to retrieve the device could cause even more damage. The incident at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is one of the most extreme examples of the misuse of drones at the National Park - but it's far from the only one.

This is a new phenomenon for us in Yellowstone,' Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash told MailOnline. Both before and after the rule change, Park officials have been hearing from visitors that drones are disrupting their experience at the nation's national wonders. Park Service spokesman Jeffrey Olson detailed several instances in the last several months, including: . Flying drones has become a rapidly-growing hobby in the United States as models become cheaper and more widely available (stock image) Mr Olson said the Park Service banned the use of drones on 400 parks and refuges while agency looks at adopting rules for flying them. Either way, they likely won't be allow in Yellowstone or other marquee parks. 'We do think they’re going to be appropriate for some places,' Mr Olson told MailOnline. 'Not in the Zions, the Yellowstones and the Yosemites, those kind of iconic landscapes - probably not.' Despite the nuisance that visitors are reporting, in Yellowstone, at least, officials are doing nothing to educate visitors that drones are banned. There are no signs posted at the park and the semi-annual park newspaper that lists major rules and regulations doesn't include a ban on drones, Mr Nash said. Meanwhile, parks officials are still investigating the crash at the Grand Prismatic Spring. They have not been able to spot the drone from the shore of the lake, which is about one and a half acres. Mr Nash said rangers are considering flying a helicopter over the spring to see if they can spot the drone.","Park rangers fear the drone could upset the delicate balance of algae, bacteria and minerals that gives the Grand Prismatic Spring it brilliant color .

"By . Michael Zennie . and Associated  Press Reporter . A 24-year-old pitcher in California as just been signed by the Minnesota Twins and already his story seems ready-made for a Hollywood movie. Brandon Poulson throws 100mph fastballs, he ran a 60-yard dash in 6.6 seconds in his stocking feet and has a 40-inch vertical jump. And before he was discovered by major league scouts, he was splitting his time between pitching for the Healdsburg Prune Packers in Northern California's wine country and driving a front-loader for his dad's company - John's Excavating. 'I played for the Prune Packers summer of 2013, but missed nearly three-fourths of the games because I was busy . working,' said Poulson, who didn’t make his high school baseball team as . a freshman. Flamethrower: Brandon Poulson stand 6-foot-6 and pitches at a blistering 100mph . Poulson went un-drafted and un-noticed. He was even on the verge of quitting sports. He played baseball and football in junior college, but was just about to end the dream and move back home to take over his father's business. 'It’s a great story. This kid came out of nowhere,' Twins West Coast scouting supervisor Sean Johnson said Tuesday. This week the Twins signed Poulson for $250,000 - ten times the market rate for an un-drafted pitching prospect. They sent him to their rookie league in Elizabethton, Tennessee, where the team hopes his flamethrower arm will develop into a devastating weapon for the major leagues. Poulson missed much of last season because he was working for his father . 'He's like Ivan Drago. You know that scene in Rocky IV: ""Whatever he hits… he destroys."" That's what he reminds me of,' Twins Elliott Strankman told Yahoo Sports. To top it all off, when asked what he planned to do with his new-found wealth, Poulson said his first major purchase will be a therapy device to help his father with his disabetes. The Twins knew about Poulson from his recent season with Academy of Art University, where he had an 8.38 ERA for the San Francisco school. Poulson played there after taking a couple of years off to work in his father’s business - 'John’s Excavating' - with the thought he’d take it over someday and leave athletics behind for good. The 6-foot-6 right-hander previously played baseball, but chose football at Santa Rosa Junior College. Poulson travelled to Minneapolis last week to undergo a physical at Target Field before returning to Northern California, then was cleared Tuesday. He was set to travel Wednesday to the Twins’ rookie club in the Appalachian League in . Poulson will sign his contract once he reports. He could pitch in a game as soon as this weekend. Until last fall, Poulson was operating heavy machinery - driving 18-wheelers, front-loaders and backhoes. All the while, he played baseball in a Sunday night men’s league, fittingly called the 'Wine Country' league. 'I went to work with my father and didn’t want to gamble with sports anymore,' Poulson said. He later changed his mind and decided to give baseball one last try, spending months retooling his delivery with Prune Packers pitching coach Caleb Balbuena. Poulson’s stats this summer: 31 strikeouts and six hits in 12.1 innings, with four saves in 12 appearances. The Twins consider him among the best athletes they have pursued: a health nut, Poulson weighs 240 pounds and ran a 6.6-second 60-yard dash. He has a 40-inch vertical leap. The San Francisco Giants wanted to sign Poulson, who also drew interest from the Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies. Those teams didn’t have enough money remaining in their draft pool to match Minnesota. Poulson is going into the Twins minor league farm system in the hopes that his flamethrower arm develops into a major league-caliber weapon . 'He’s a physical specimen. He’s got the best pure arm strength I’ve ever seen,' Twins scout Elliott Strankman said. Strankman is the only member of the organization who watched Poulson pitch. It took all of 18 throws to convince him. 'We’re cautiously optimistic because we don’t want to put a bunch of pressure on the kid. He could be pretty good. This is uncharted territory for us,' he said. At Academy of Art’s scout day, only the position players were running 60-yard dashes until Poulson turned up and insisted on sprinting. He hadn’t warmed up and was wearing only socks. 'I had cold legs,' he said. 'Maybe I would have run it faster.' Strankman went to see him pitch for the Prune Packers on July 15. Poulson reached agreement on a contract two days later. This week, Poulson is headed for the minor leagues. 'I’m excited,' he said. 'I know it’s just the first step of what the real goal is, to make it in the bigs.' Poulson went 0-0 with a high ERA in 14 appearances and 19.1 innings for Academy of Art this season. He struck out 24, walked 24 and opponents hit .189 against him. The Twins, who selected shortstop Nick Gordon with the fifth overall pick in last month’s draft, had the financial flexibility to pull this off. 'It was a group effort. You just don’t see stuff like this every day,' Strankman said. 'It’s one of those great days as a scout you hope you have every five years.'","Brandon Poulson was pitching for the Healsburg Prune Packers and working for his dad's business - John's Excavating .

"By . Michael Zennie . and James Nye . Sudden: Lisa Mason passed away while she was studying to be a nurse after taking out a $100,000 student loan . Donations are pouring in for a California couple who were saddled with $200,000 of their daughter's student loan debts when she died suddenly of liver failure. A GoFundMe page has already raised nearly $11,000 in less than two days - including one anonymous donation of $5,000. Pastor Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle are trying to raise their daughter Lisa's three children while paying $2,000 a month for loans she took out to attend nursing school. Lisa tragically died last year of liver failure at the age of 27. Lisa children, which Mr and Mrs Mason are now caring for, are age nine, 12 and 14. 'We've been totally blown away. It's so encouraging to realize there's a lot of good people out there,' Pastor Mason told CNN Money. It also appears that the loan companies that had refused to negotiate with Pastor Mason have now been shamed into leniency. Navient Corp, which had been insisting Mr Mason pay $35,000 has lowered the principle to $27,000 and dropped interest rates to zero percent on three of the four loans. Another debt collection firm has said it plans to forgive the entire $15,000 loan debt after it was contacted by CNN Money. Scroll down for video . Guardians: Steve Mason and wife Darnelle with their grandchildren, ages, nine, 12 and 14 - who they are caring for . Before . her death, Lisa Mason had taken out $100,000 in private student loans . to fund her education at nursing school and crucially, Steve had . co-signed on them. In . the five years since her tragic passing, the Masons' inability . to keep up with the payments has seen the sum owed double to $200,000 . because of the high interest rates and late-fee penalties. Previously, . each time Paston Mason had appealed to the lenders to beg for help, the . couple have been told that the only solution is to repay the mammoth . loans - some of which have interest rates of 12 percent - in full. Compounding . the desperation, Steve makes less than $75,000 a year at Oasis Church . in Redlands, California and Darnelle earns less in her role as director . at the same church. Even . if Pastor Mason declared bankruptcy, the student loan debt could never . be forgiven. He will either pay it off, or take it to the grave. 'It's just impossible on a pastor's salary raising three kids to pay $2,000 a month on loans,' said Mason to CNN Money, claiming that he is now searching for a second job. The answer to why Steve is in such dire financial straits is because these are private student loans. Mom and daughter: Lisa Mason with her mother, Darnelle, before her tragic and sudden death from liver failure in 2009 . Had they been federal student loans, then Steve could have appealed to have them wiped or at the very least received a sensible and manageable payment plan.

Private lenders are not bound by federal regulations to provide assistance to those in financial difficulty, according to CNN Money, not even when a family member has passed away.","California pastor Steve Mason and his wife Darnelle are facing financial ruin .

"By . Michael Zennie . A bearded marijuana activist who calls himself Rev. Bud Green has claimed responsibility for running up white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge earlier this month. The bleached American flags above one of New York's most recognizable landmarks drew national attention - an concern from city authorities who say the vandals should never have been able to make up the towers of the bridge unnoticed. Green, who gained a small amount of fame on the 1980s talk show circuit by claiming that he worshiped God by smoking pot, posted an online rant on Wednesday saying that the white flags were meant as a political statement made by members of his POT (People Opposing Tyranny) Party. Showman: Rev. Bud Green gained notoriety on the 1980s talk show circuit for lighting up on TV and claiming smoking marijuana was akin to worshiping God . 'The Flags symbolize the need for the new Pledge of No Allegiance that the Rev. Bud Green and the Pot Party revealed to the Public on the Fourth of July,' he claimed. 'On the night of July 22, brave members of the Pot Party and supporters of my candidacy for Prez in 2016 courageously climbed up and put up the new bleached flags.' In his short online screed, 49-year-old Green said that his supporters had hoped to replace the bleached American flags with a POT Party flag and a new flag that Green designed to represent his image of the United States. 'This flag was to be a logo of corporate media conglomerate GE and a Nazi Swastika with a background of bombs and guns,' he ranted. 'This unfortunately is what Amerikkka has become and is exactly why we need civil disobedience and non violent Revolution to truly change this country.' Cops said they are treating the vandalism as a serious security breach and are investigating the flag swap . The Southern California-based activist told the New York Daily News that he didn't physically participate in the caper, but it was carried out by 'professional's in New York. 'It was interesting that people took it as a terror risk. We believe in nonviolent civil disobedience. The government has everybody scared s***less,' he told the newspaper. Green compared the action at the Brooklyn Bridge to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s non-violent civil rights protests. The New York Police Department said it is reviewing Greens' claim of responsibility - but did not comment on the validity of his statement. Hello my fellow herb worshippers and revolutionaries. I can finally reveal that it was members of the New Pot Party that put up the bleached White Flags in NY that the whole country is talking about. The Flags symbolize the need for the new Pledge of No Allegiance that the Rev. Bud Green and the Pot Party revealed to the Public on the Fourth of July.  On the night of July 22, brave members of the Pot Party and supporters of my candidacy for Prez in 2016 courageously climbed up and put up the new bleached flags. The original plan was then to replace the bleached flags with 2 new flags but the fascist police prevented us from doing it with their constant surveillance. The 2 new flags were gonna be the Pot Party flag which is a marijuana leaf with the revolutionary slogan Don’t Tread on Me to symbolize the beginning of a new American Revolution to be led by Pot Party Supporters. The other flag was to represent what the good old USA has become now that we are fully under the control of the Republicratic party and the united corporations of America.This flag was to be a logo of corporate media conglomerate GE and a Nazi Swastika with a background of bombs and guns. This unfortunately is what Amerikkka has become and is exactly why we need civil disobedience and non violent Revolution to truly change this country. Please smoke the Peace Pipe with the holy herb and rebel against the military industrial complex and the evil one percent.  That is the meaning of why we put up the bleached American Flags. Remember to recite the new Pledge of No Allegiance. Please repeat after me, I Pledge no Allegiance to the United Corporations of America, and to the right wing dictatorship for which it stands, one nation, under the devil, with liberty and justice for only the rich pigs who can afford it. Put that it in your pipe and smoke it Fox News.","Rev Bud Green, 49, claims members of his POT Party ran up the white flags as a political protest .

"By . Joel Christie . and Michael Zennie . Before relocating his family from Texas to West Africa last year to work in a clinic trying to help contain the Ebola virus epidemic - where he inevitably caught the incurable and highly-deadly disease - Dr. Kent Brantly gave a sermon in his hometown explaining his decision. The religious reasons for the missionary trip have been revealed as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the father-of-two 'seems to be improving', 24 hours after landing in Georgia from Liberia on Saturday for treatment. Brantly was transferred amid high security to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, which is fitted out with one of the most sophisticated containment facilities in America. He was pictured being helped out of a special ambulance in a hazmat suit and walking into the hospital. CDS chief Tom Frieden told Face the Nation on CBS on Sunday they hope Brantly will 'continue to improve', but could not say whether they think he will survive the virus. Scroll down for video . Arrived: This image, taken from a CNN helicopter, appears to show Dr. Kent Brantly being helped out of an ambulance at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Saturday after arriving from Liberia in West Africa . Ebola: Seemingly uneasy on his feet, Dr Kent Brantly (left) is helped into Emory University Hospital in Atlanta by medical staff . Specially contained: Dr. Kent Brantly, one of two Americans who contracted the deadly Ebola virus while working in West Africa, landed in the U.S. Saturday and is en route to Emory University Hospital for treatment . Infection on-board: An ambulance carrying Dr. Kent Brantley, the American doctor with Ebola, departs Dobbins Air  Reserve Base on Saturday in Marietta Georgia . Frieden said he did not believe Brantley had inffected his wife and children, who were with him in Liberia. 'When patients are exposed to Ebola but not sick, they cannot infect others ... Our understanding is that they did not have contact with him when he was sick,' Frieden told CBS. Before Brantly went to Liberia last October, he returned to his hometown of Indianapolis and gave a sermon at the Southeastern Church of Christ, which has been obtained by The Blaze. 'For two years we will live and work and serve among the people who, until the last 10 years of peace, had known nothing but the violence and devastation of war for the previous 20 years,' Brantly told the congregation. 'I've never been to Liberia. '(I'm going) because God has a call on my life.' 'On difficult days, when I want to give up or when I wonder if I've made the right decision, retelling my story reminds me of how God has brought me to where I am.' Brantly was able to meet with his wife, Amber, in protective conditions for 45 minutes after arriving in the country on Saturday, NBC reported. She said he was in 'great spirits and extremely grateful' to be home according to a statement released on her behalf by the Christian charity Samaritan's Purse. The doctor's sister, mother and father are also at the hospital and it was a 'relief to welcome him home', they said via the charity. U.S. officials are confident that Brantly and a second patient - aid worker Nancy Writebol, who is expected to arrive in Atlanta on Tuesday- can be treated without putting the public in any danger. The . specialized unit at Emory University Hospital where the two will be contained was opened a dozen years . ago to care for federal health workers exposed to some of the world's . most dangerous germs. Arrived: Dr. Kent Brantly, who caught Ebola at a treatment clinic in Foya, Liberia, has been evacuated to the United States for treatment . Landed: An airplane carrying American doctor Kent Brantly who has the Ebola virus, arrives at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Georgia, on August 2, 2014 . Fight of their lives: Dr. Kent Brantly (left) and hygienist aid worker Nancy Writebol are both in grave conditions as . they battle incurable Ebola . This is a glimpse inside the containment ward at Emory University Hospital where the two American Ebola patients will be cared for after they arrive in the U.S. Now . it's being pressed into service for the two seriously ill Americans who . worked at a hospital in Liberia, one of the three West Africa countries . hit by the largest Ebola outbreak in history. CDC . Director Dr Tom Frieden acknowledged that many Americans are terrified . about bringing Dr Brantly and hygienist Writebol back to the U.S. to . continue the treatment of their incurable Ebola infections but insisted . there was no risk. 'But . I really hope that people's fear won't outweigh their compassion. We've . got a real challenge in Africa and what we need to focus on is stopping . the outbreak there. We will be able to stop it, but its going to take . supporting people,' he told CNN. 'And that means if people who are on that supporting mission get sick, we care for them.' Dr Frieden added: 'Ebola is a huge risk in Africa. It's not going to be a huge risk in the U.S.' According to WXIA, . Emory's isolation unit is on the ground floor and has three beds with . the highest standards in negative pressure air handling, HEPA filtration . and exhaust. 'When . this unit was being built, we hoped we'd never have to use the space to . treat a serious communicable disease,' said Emory epidemiologist Bruce . Ribner. Special jet: The plane carrying the two Ebola sufferers is designed to transport very ill patients long distances under constant medical care . Containment: Inside the jet, the patients will be quarantined in these isolation tents called aeromedical biological containment systems . The custom-designed jet left Atlanta for Liberia on Thursday . Efforts . have been made to help the two patients with the means available in . Liberia - and just hours before the flight to Atlanta was revealed, . father-of-two Brantly gave up the single vial of an experimental . treatment sent over from the U.S. in order that Writebol - a grandmother . and longtime Christian missionary - could receive it instead. Brantly received a transfusion of the blood of a 14-year-old Ebola . survivor who he personally helped to treat. Giving blood transfusions from . survivors to still suffering Ebola patients is an established, though . not nearly proven, treatment for the largely untreatable disease. However, on Thursday charity SIM said in a statement that Mrs Writebol's condition had worsened, despite the serum. Her husband, David, is close by but can only visit his wife through a window or dressed in a haz-mat suit. 'We . continue to pray for Nancy's full and complete recovery,' said Bruce . Johnson, president of SIM USA. 'Even though her condition has worsened, . we know she is receiving the best possible medical care, and we are . thankful that she has access to this experimental drug. 'We believe in the power of prayer and . ask people around the world not only to pray for Nancy and Kent, but . also for everyone affected by this terrible virus.' The moment CNN reported a plane was leaving the United States to pick up the American volunteers in Liberia suffering from Ebola, Twitter lit up with Americans fuming over the decision. Many were unable to understand why the patients couldn't simply be treated in Liberia. 'Is it necessary that this person come to the U.S.?  Can't this be done other there?  Ego trip?' tweeted @1ronweed. At least one of the dissenting tweets come from none other than Donald Trump. 'Ebola patient will be brought to the U.S. in a few days - now I know for sure that our  leaders are incompetent. KEEP THEM OUT OF HERE!' @realDonaldTrump wrote. Donald Trump is none-too-happy with the decision to bring an Ebola patient to the US . Still others were simply thankful the patient or patients were being taken to Georgia. 'Thank god I don't live in Atlanta,' tweeted @TheMadPatriot. So should we be worried? Not if the CDC's best-there-is containment systems and procedures work as they are supposed to. The patient or patients will be housed in an area of Emory's hospital that is physically separate from other patient areas, according to CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. And inside the air will be filtered and none no staff will have any physical contact whatsoever with an infected patient outside of specialized hazmat-like suits. However, the move also comes soon after the CDC's recent string of reported mishandlings of other dangerous pathogens--namely athrax and influenza--made headlines--made headlines and even forced the resignation of the head of the government lab that potentially exposed workers to live anthrax. Dr Brantly was in West Africa with the missionary group responding to the Ebola outbreak when he was diagnosed last week. His wife and children returned to the United States before Dr Brantly showed any signs of illness. Samaritan's Purse has evacuated all of its non-essential personnel for the Ebola outbreak. Meanwhile . on Thursday, U.S. health officials warned Americans not to travel to the . three West African countries hit by an outbreak of Ebola. The . travel advisory applies to nonessential travel to Guinea, Liberia and . Sierra Leone, where the deadly disease has killed more than 700 people . this year. Father: Dr Brantly, pictured with his family, ensured Writebol received the experimental drug instead of him after a small amount arrived in Liberia, the Samaritan's Purse charity said on Wednesday . Waiting for an answer: Nancy Writebol, pictured with her husband David, is entering a critical stage of her Ebola treatment and will either show signs of recovery or inevitable death . Last week Dr Brantly, 33, was identified as the first American to be diagnosed with Ebola, which kills up to 90 per cent of those it infects. Mrs Writebol, 60, an educator turned missionary from Charlotte, North Carolina, was the second. The first stage of the illness is characterised by fever, headaches, nausea, vomiting, a rash and diarrhea. The second however is haemorrhagic fever in which patients endure difficulty breathing and swallowing and agonising bleeding inside their body. Blood pours out of their ears and nose and turns their eyes from white to red. They die an agonising death. Generally patients who enter the second stage do not survive. Mr Johnson said that SIM USA had not yet identified how Dr Brantly and Mrs Writebol had become infected but said that they take ‘extreme safety measures’ and follow guidelines from the Centre For Disease Control. He said: 'Our hearts just break for them.'","Father-of-two Dr. Kent Brantly landed in Marietta, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, on Saturday morning, from Liberia in West Africa .

"By . Michael Zennie . President Warren G. Harding had a nickname for his private parts - one he used quite often. He called them Jerry. It's just one of the tawdry and embarrassing revelations from a trove of steamy love letters that Harding wrote to his mistress Carrie Fulton Phillips during their 15-year affair. Today, the letters were finally made public by the Library of Congress after being kept under seal for 50 years at the request of Harding's surviving relatives. In the age of disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and the salacious details about President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Harding's letters feel almost comical. Harding was president from 1921 until his death in office in 1923, a short, unremarkable tenure. He broke off his relationship with Phillips before he was elected to the White House - but maintained it while he was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and a U.S. Senator. Scroll down for video . Affair: Warren G. Harding (left) carried on a 15-year affair with Carrie Phillips (right) before he was president. He wrote 900 pages of adoring, and sometime bawdy, love letters to her. She kept all of them, despite his request that she burn them . August 20, 1918: Harding tells his mistress - 'Wish I could take you to Mnt. Jerry. Wonderful spot. Not in the geographies but a heavenly place, and I have seen some passing views there and reveled in them. Gee! How I wish you might be along. You could be such a dandy companion - it would be adorable to have you. I am sure I would be sweetly content - you could make me so.' The letter above was written on letterhead from the Pavilion Hotel in Montpelier, Vermont. Some of his letters were even written on U.S. Senate stationary and letterhead . But it's clear - in the hundreds of pages of correspondence that Mrs Phillips kept - that Harding was wild about her. The New York Times Magazine offered several excerpts from the letters earlier this month, taken from  the book The Harding Affair: Love and Espionage During the Great War. 'I love your poise/ Of perfect thighs/ When they hold me in paradise,' Harding wrote in a poem to her in January 1912. He wrote in September 1913: 'Honestly, I hurt with the insatiate longing, until I feel that there will never be any relief until I take a long, deep, wild draught on your lips and then bury my face on your pillowing breasts. 'Oh, Carrie! I want the solace you only can give. It is awful to hunger so and be so wholly denied.' Warren G. Harding was married to Florence Harding, who managed his business affairs and was a well-liked and adept political wife who helped his career . January 28, 1912: Harding wrote a lengthy poem to his mistress in which he alluded to the fact that they had made love at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve in Montreal. He wrote: 'I love your poise/ Of perfect thighs When they hold me in paradise. I love the rose/ Your garden grows/ Love seashell pink/ That over it glows. I love to suck Your breath away I love to cling /There long to stay.' The 900 pages of letters contain countless details about Warren G. Harding's affair with Carrie Phillips, but a pattern develops. He refers to his private parts - and sometimes himself - as Jerry, part of a strange code. He also references several times the moment they had sex at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve 1911 in Montreal. Here are a few of the zingers - culled from New York Times Magazine: . Harding also tended to get a bit bawdy in his letters, telling her: 'Wish I could take you to Mount Jerry. Wonderful spot' - an obvious reference to his private parts. Harding asked his mistress to destroy the letters after reading them, but like any good political mistress, she kept them as evidence of her relationship with Harding. Harding was married to Florence Harding, who proved to be an adept business manager and stateswoman in her own right. Mr Phillips was married to one of Harding's friends, businessman James Phillips. Historians say that neither marriage was happy. Mrs Harding suffered from kidney inflammation that was never properly treated. Mrs Phillips spent much of her time away from her husband in Ohio - living in Berlin and other parts of Europe. Mrs Phillips has also been accused by one modern historian of being a German spy, though other researchers are skeptical and her relatives fiercely deny the allegations. Some of the letters were published in the 2009 book the Harding Affair, however, the trove that was released on Tuesday have remained under seal since July 29, 1964. Harding's grand nephew fought to keep them secret for 50 years after the ruling. However, Harding's remaining relatives aren't entirely happy that the former president's dirty laundry is on show for everyone to see. 'There are times when I wish he had sealed them for 75 years,' Richard Harding, the former president's great-nephew told the Columbus Dispatch.","Warren G.

A career criminal who gunned down a veteran police officer during a routine traffic stop has been captured following a shootout with cops - ending a massive manhunt that paralyzed St. Paul, Minnesota on Wednesday. Mendota Heights Police officer Scott Patrick, a 47-year-old married father of two, was shot and killed after pulling over Brian George Fitch, 39, shortly after noon in the quiet Twin Cities suburb, according to authorities.

Tre Grinner's dream is to be an investment banker. Tre Grinner got to tour the floor of the New York Stock Exchange as part of his dream internship with the Make-A-Wish Foundation . This week, he has been able to realize that dream with the help of Goldman Sachs, one of the most successful - and notorious - investment banks in America. 'I have a deep interest in complicated things. So far, investing has been the most complicated thing I have ever attempted to understand – bonds, futures, IPOs, mergers & acquisitions – and the way they connect to global markets and global news is amazing to me,' he told Business Insider. In his week-long adventure on Wall Street, Goldman gave him all-star treatment that even some of the most successful bankers are likely to envy. Business Insider reports that Mr Grinner's itinerary includes an appearance on CNBC's 'Power Lunch,' touring the New York Stock Exchange and meeting traders on the floor,  ringing the opening bell at the NASDAQ and a meeting with Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein. The California teenager also got a taste of the high life that bankers can enjoy. He was given two made-to-measure Ralph Lauren suits, a pair of designer shoes - and will enjoy a private tour of Yankee Stadium and a meet-and-greet with retiring star Derek Jeter.

DNA Info New York reports that all three drivers were able to get their vehicles back - and the charges against them dismissed - after proving that they weren't working a taxi drivers - but as personal chauffeurs. Last September, city inspectors stopped Ibrahim Senturk in his Chevrolet Suburban as he was driving across Manhattan. In his backseat: one of the sons of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who was at the time the Emir of Qatar and one of the richest monarchs in the world.

Last November, Hong Kong billionaire Silas Chou found himself without a chauffeur or a ride when Taxi and Limo inspectors stopped his Rafal Czubek as Mr Chou was getting out of the car on East 52nd Street and Fifth Avenue. Despite Mr Czubeck's protests that Mr Chou was paying him $60 an hour to be his chauffeur and personal assistant, inspectors seized his Cadillac Escalade. Officials were forced to give it back after a judge threw out the charges when Mr Czubeck appealed and said he helped look after the 'high-maintenance' Mr Chou, according to court records obtained by DNA Info.

"By . Michael Zennie . and Daily Mail Reporter . The New York Police Department reportedly has assigned nearly three-dozen detectives from various units to figure out who who scaled the Brooklyn Bridge Monday night and hoisted white flags above the New York City landmark. Investigators have reportedly identified some of the suspects, but currently only know their nicknames, according to published reports. Police believe that the flags were taken down and then replaced with bleached-white banners. Scroll down for video . Whitewash: This photo shows that the flags above the Brooklyn Bridge appear to have been bleached American Flags - the stars and stripes are faintly visible . No one knows why or how the flags were hoisted above the Brooklyn Bridge. Officials called it a major security breach . According to the New York Post, the . NYPD has taken investigators from homicide, counter-terrorism, intel and . transit units to find the culprits. The . paper reports that detectives from Manhattan’s Sixth, Seventh, Ninth . and 10th Precincts also have been brought in for the investigation. 'We have no good images of these guys on cameras . . . None of the . footage captures the perpetrators of this crime,' a police source said. The . NYPD is treating the prank as a serious security breach and many New . Yorkers are wondering how the culprits were able to slip past the police . officers and surveillance cameras unnoticed at 3.30am. Police . believe that there were four or five thieves and that they worked in . two teams - one for each bridge tower - to take down the flags. A video from ABC News shows NYPD officers taking down the defaced banner after scaling the bridge about 11am on Tuesday. As the New York Post reports, however, this isn't the first time that the American flags have gone missing from the bridge - one of New York's most recognizable icons. In 2012, thieves swiped the flags from both ends of the bridge, though the story never made it to the media, bridge painter Nick Krevatas told the Post. The flags were replaced and the thieves have still never been caught. In 2004, during the Republican National Convention in New York, the flags were also stolen. NYPD officials said that they believe the vandals may have been at the top of the bridge before. They tacked aluminum covers on the lights illuminating the flags, so that no one would notice the Stars and Stripes had been taken down until daybreak. 'For . someone to go around it and go up to the tower and have right size . cover to put over the light, there's some indication of pre-operational . planning,' NYPD Deputy Commissioner John Miller said on Tuesday. EarthCam . video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am. The second tower went dark seven minutes later, indicating the heist was . at least a two-person job. So far, the NYPD has no clue who is . behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they . don't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics.

"By . Michael Zennie . Joseph Crabtree, 17, is believed to have killed his mother before taking his own life . A shocking mother-son suicide pact in suburban Tulsa, Oklahoma, led a 17-year-old prep school student to shoot dead his 50-year-old parent before turning the gun on himself, police have revealed. Detectives say they will never know for certain how Joseph Crabtree and his mother Kimberly died in their home on Tuesday - but there was no sign of forced entry or struggle. Police believe that Joseph killed his mother and then killed himself. Investigation had led cops to the conclusion that they both were in agreement about their deaths, the Tulsa World reports. Joseph had attended the prestigious Cascia Hall Preparatory School, a $11,000-a-year private academy. He recently transferred to Bishop Kelley High School, a Catholic high school that charges similar tuition. Police said they do not know what prompted Joseph and Kimberly Crabtree to decide to end their lives. In . 2008, Joseph C. Crabtree, Joseph's father and Kimberly's husband, died . of heart failure at age 52. He ran a massive chain of car dealerships in . Connecticut until 2007, when his company abruptly closed its doors amid . allegations of fraud and threats of a criminal investigation by the . state Attorney General. An obituary reveals that the elder Crabtree also had another son and a daughter. It is not believed they were home at the time Joseph and Kimberly died. A relative called police on Tuesday night after she had been unable to reach Kimberly or Joseph and no one answered the door when she went to the home. Police entered the house in a quiet suburban neighborhood and found the two dead. 'Last night after learning of Joe’s death, many of his former classmates asked to gather at our chapel to support each other in dealing with this tragic loss,' Roger Carter, the headmaster of Cascia Hall, said in a message to parents and students, according to the World. Reverend Brian O'Brien, the president of Bishop Kelley, called the deaths 'very tragic.' The mother and son were found dead in their suburban Tulsa home after police were called for a well-being check .","Joseph Crabtree, 17, and mother Kimberly Crabree, 50, were found dead in their Tulsa home .

"By . Associated Press . and Michael Zennie . A white Detroit man who killed a young, unarmed black woman on his porch heard her 'boom, boom, boom' at least four separate times before he opened the door and shot her in the face. The pounding caused Theodore Wafer to fear for his life, his defense lawyer argued today, and made his use of force justifiable under Michigan self-defense law. Jurors heard opening statements Wednesday in the trial of Wafer, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 19-year-old Renisha McBride last November in Dearborn Heights. The 55-year-old Wafer claims he acted in self-defense, but prosecutors say his actions were unreasonable. The shooting occurred around 4.30am, 3-and-a-half hours after McBride crashed her car about a half-mile away. An autopsy found she was drunk and had marijuana in her system. On trial: Theodore Wafer listens during opening arguments at his trial. He stands accused of second-degree murder . McBride's pounding on the door at such . an early hour led Wafer to think his life was in danger, defense . attorney Cheryl Carpenter told jurors. '""People . were trying to get in."" That was reasonable for Ted to believe and . that's what he believed that night,"" Carpenter said, according to the . Detroit Free Press. 'Why? He doesn't have a clue.' McBride . had been smoking marijuana most of the day before she was killed. Her . friend, Amber Jenkins said that McBride had been at her house partying . that night. The pair played drinking games and smoked three blunts . together. Ms Jenkins estimated that McBride had half a fifth of New Amsterdam Vodka - which sells for about $12 to $14. Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark says Wafer could have called police instead of shooting McBride. Tragic: Renisha McBride, 19, was shot in the face and died on the porch of a Dearborn Heights, Michigan, house after she crashed her car while driving home from a party . Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter says Wafer feared for his life. But Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Danielle Hagaman-Clark told jurors that despite the loud noises of McBride knocking on Wafer's door - she was no threat to him and never was. 'There was no prying (of the doors) or no kicking,' she said, according to the Detroit News. The screen door, which Wafer fired through to shoot McBride, was still locked when police arrived. The shooting has stoked racial tensions in Detroit. McBride's family and community activists have compared her death to that of Trayvon Martin - another unarmed black teenager who was shot and killed by a man who claimed self-defense. The jury of 12 and two alternates is made up of seven men and seven women. Four jurors are black.","Theodore Wafer is accused of second-degree murder for killing Renisha McBride on his porch last November .

"By . Michael Zennie . The water level in a key Southern California aquifer has hit a historic low as drought continues to ravage the state - leaving local leaders scrambling for ways to convince Californians to cut back on their water use. The San Bernardino Basin is down by more than 163billion gallons - about 500,000 acre-feet, from its maximum level, Douglas Headrick, the manager for the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, told the Los Angeles Times. It's the lowest level ever recorded - lower than the previous record set in 1964, which came after 20 years of drought. Diamond Valley Lake, the giant regional reservoir in Riverside County, has been dramatically drained by the massive drought that is afflicting nearly all of California . The aquifer is a key source of water for much of the Inland Empire, a sprawling metropolitan region with 4.2million people. 'This isn’t just an issue for San Bernardino, but many other cities depend on this basin for much of their water supply, including Redlands, Highland, Loma Linda, Rialto, Colton and Riverside,' water resource manager Bob Tincher told the Times. Exacerbating the problem is that communities that normally sell the Inland Empire excess water are cutting back deliveries as they are squeezed by drought, as well. Despite the crisis - more than 80percent of California is in extreme drought and more than a third of the state is experiencing expectational drought' (the worst classification) - many Californians don't seem to be terribly conscious of where their water comes from. More than 80percent of California is in extreme drought and more than a third is suffering 'exceptional drought' - the worst classification . A new survey shows that less than five percent of residents of the Inland Empire know that nearly a third of the water they consume is imported from other areas. Earlier this month, officials were shocked to find that after announcing water conservation measures, many Southern California areas reported an increase in water usage. In the nearby Temacula Valley in Riverside County, officials announced they could begin to limit the amount of water being pumped out of the aquifer there over concern that it could be sucked so dry that it would never recover when the rains finally return.","The San Bernardino Basin supplies water to much of the Inland Empire of California and its 4.2million residents .

"By . Associated Press . and Michael Zennie . A Massachusetts teenager charged with raping and murdering his teacher last year after following her into a bathroom followed a chillingly similar plan when he attacked a female jail counselor last month in the youth detention center where he was being held, authorities say. In the second alleged attack, Philip Chism, 15, made sure he wasn't being watched, took off his footwear to muffle his footsteps, then crouched down as he made his way along a corridor before following the 29-year-old woman into the locker room at Metro Youth Services facility in Boston on June 2, prosecutor Mark Zanini told a judge in Boston Juvenile Court on Wednesday. Chism, with a pencil in his hand, pushed the woman against the wall in the bathroom, choked her, and then hit her in the head with his fists, he said. He then stabbed her in the back with the pencil. Philip Chism, 15, is pictured Wednesday in court for a hearing on his alleged assault of a female jail counselor . Chism is accused of following his math . teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, into a bathroom at Danvers High School last . October and attacking her after classes let out for the day. He . beat, strangled and raped her before slashing her throat with a box . cutter, police say. He then dragged her body to the woods behind the . school, where he positioned her with a tree branch sticking from her . genitals and left it for authorities to find, according to court . documents. In the horrifying June 2 attack, Chism allegedly choked the jail counselor so hard, she could not cry for help. 'The victim was trying to scream but it was ineffective because her airway was closed by virtue of the defendant's strangling her,' Zanini said. After getting Chism's hand off her neck, she screamed and other facility workers pulled Chism away from her, Zanini said. She suffered injuries to her face, jaw, neck and back, and got a hole in the back of her shirt that was the same size as a pencil, which was found on the floor, Zanini said. Jail guards reported that he was acting normally just moments before the alleged attack and they had no indication he was planning violence. Missed: Math teacher Colleen Ritzer, 24, was raped and killed with a box cutter last October . Chism was being held at the facility without bail after pleading not guilty to killing Danvers High School math teacher Colleen Ritzer in October. Chism, who was 14 at the time, had recently moved to Danvers from Clarksville, Tennessee, after his parents went through a 'stressful' divorce. He has since been moved to a different detention facility. He was ordered held on $250,000 bail in the attack on the youth worker on charges of attempted murder by strangulation, assault with intent to murder, kidnapping, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. The handcuffed Chism hung his head throughout the proceeding and did not speak other than to say 'yes' when the judge asked him if he understood that he was not allowed to have any contact with the worker or any witnesses in the case. He didn't enter a plea. His mother was also in court. Chism is being charged as a youthful offender in the Boston case, meaning the proceedings in juvenile court are open and expose him to potential adult penalties. Chism's attorney, Denise Regan, did not challenge the bail or conditions of bail. She asked that her client be excused from his next scheduled court appearance on September 19 because of the stress it causes him. Philip Chism, right, appears Suffolk County Juvenile Court on  Wednesday in Boston, where he was arraigned for allegedly assaulting a state worker .

"By . Ruth Styles . They're one of the most fearsome breeds of dog on the planet, infamous for their aggressive behaviour and jaws that can shake the life out of an opponent. But for 30-year-old glamour model Jolie Reine from Warrington in Cheshire, the pit bull is nothing more than a cuddly pet and she has not one but three of them. 'I have them because I love them,' she explains. 'I . really do, I'm just obsessed with them. They're just the best kind of . dog I've ever come across.' Safe: Jolie Reine, pictured with her pet Tayra, says pit bulls are unfairly maligned and are wonderful dogs . But pit bull terriers, like the Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino and Fila Brasiliero, are one of four dog breeds that British citizens cannot have in their homes without falling foul of the law. Those who do own one face a £5,000 fine, a six-month prison sentence and the prospect of having their pet taken away and destroyed. Jolie, however, thinks that the law is unfair. 'You see Red,' she says, gesturing at one of her three pit bulls. 'She was bred for fighting but she . wouldn't hurt a fly. She's been around my son for two years, around his . mates for two years and all she wants is love and attention. 'That's not an aggressive dog, is it? It's not her fault that some stupid idiot bloody . bred her and trained her to be aggressive like that to other dogs. It's . not the dog's fault, it's the owner.' Fighting: Unfortunately for Jolie, her dogs Red and Tayra sometimes fight - viciously - with each other . Cleaning up: Jolie kisses her dog Red better after she got into a bloody scrap during a visit to the park . Under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, it is illegal to own pit bulls, Japanese Tosas, Dogo Argentinos and Fila Brasilieros. Owners can expect punishments including six months in prison and a six-month fine, while the police have the power to confiscate and destroy these breeds. However, owners can apply to have the dogs legalised, although this involves a lengthy observation period away from home. Dogs that are declared safe must be neutered, muzzled in public and can never be let off the lead outside of the home. Not all pit bull types are banned, however. Staffordshire bull terriers, a harmless breed known for their gentleness with children, look similar but have totally different personalities. Sadly, their resemblance to the infamous pit bull means they are often abandoned with more Staffies taken in by sanctuaries than any other breed. Nevertheless, she's the first to admit that owning pit bulls isn't all plain sailing, not least because of their tendency to attack other dogs - and each other. 'It's not the dog's fault, it's the f***ing idiots who train them to fight like that and be so aggressive,' she fumes. 'I . hate it when they start fighting, hate it. But just because they don't like a . certain dog, it doesn't mean they're like it all the time.' But while Jolie has no intention of allowing her pets near a dog fighting ring or teaching them to behave in a vicious fashion, other owners aren't so responsible. Speaking on Channel 5 documentary, Dangerous Dog Owners and Proud, mother-of-one Tracey Dunn, 43, from Coventry, said she wouldn't mind if her animal 'ripped someone's face off'. She continued: 'I don't want her to be a soft dog. I . want her to be really, really vicious. 'I've got a 10-year-old little boy . in the house and if anybody takes his stuff, I don't care who they are - . she can rip off their faces. 'If she's going to protect . my house and bite somebody, that's what I've taught her to do.' Dangerous dogs have become an . increasingly common problem in the UK, with an estimated 40 people . killed by out-of-control hounds in the last decade alone. Banned: Owning a pit bull in the UK can result in a six month prison sentence and a £5,000 fine . Maligned: Staffies are often confused with pit bulls and although gentle, are regularly abandoned by owners . Nevertheless, Tracey, who owns two Staffordshire bull terriers - a breed that isn't usually vicious and is known to be very good with children - says she feels so unsafe at home, she's happy to risk having a dangerous dog. 'We live on a horrible street and round . the corner, we get a lot of people who do break-ins a lot,' she adds. 'It's very . rough round here now and we've got a lot of druggies. If you left 20p on . the side in your house, they'd take it. That's why you've got to have . dogs like this.' For Jolie, her pit bulls are pets and in a bid to keep them safe, she has gone to court to have them legalised - a status currently held by an estimated 2,600 British pit bulls. Although legalising a dog means police . inspections, a muzzle when in public and castration to ensure the dogs . don't reproduce, Jolie says she is happy to go ahead. Struggle: Tracey, who wants her dogs to be vicious, is having a tough time training her Staffie not to be soft . Play: Although Staffie Anna is happy to attack bottles, she appears reluctant to do the same to people . 'I think if pit bulls have to wear a . muzzle then every other dog should wear one,' she complains. 'Any dog can bite . another dog so I don't really agree with the muzzle side but I'm definitely . sticking to the rules. 'I went through all that trouble just to get them . legalised and I wouldn't risk my dogs' lives. If everyone was a responsible . owner, there would be no dog fights in public, there would be no dogs . getting savaged, there'd be no kids getting savaged or anything like . that.' She adds: 'They're my family and . that is it. They're not a status symbol, they're not a weapon, they're . not for breeding - they're just family and that is it.'

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . This is the moment a bungling driver got his 45ft-long lorry stuck between a pub and a cafe after blindly following directions from his sat nav. The vehicle and its driver were stuck in the narrow bend for half-an-hour until police removed fencing from the pub's beer garden to make room. The lorry was on its way to a Muller dairy factory when it became stuck in the road in Market Drayton, Shropshire. The lorry and its driver became stuck between the Kings Head Inn and Gill's Pudding Cafe in Market Drayton . Mark King, landlord of the King's Head pub, watched the man try to drive into the narrow street without any knowledge of how tight the space was. 'I was in my garden having a coffee when I saw the lorry trying to turn. 'It was a 45-foot wagon and the driver tried to take the corner and in the end became totally stuck. 'We were shouting at the driver to stop but I don’t think he spoke very good English. 'I had to call the police because he had blocked the road, and he was there for about 30 minutes or so while they worked to unblock him.' Mr King said he had seen lots of trucks and lorries try to trying to make the turn before, but none had ever become lodged in between his pub and the cafe across the road. It was the first time anyone had become stuck in narrow bend, said pub landlord Mark King . 'We do see a lot of trucks trying to turn down here and it is very tight, really too tight for that kind of vehicle.' 'Ideally we could do with stopping lorries turning down here, but I’m not sure how we can do that. 'On saying that this is the first time I have seen a lorry get wedged here, and well that’s sat navs for you.' Gill Smith who owns Gill's Pudding Cafe said: 'Sat nav was certainly no help to this driver looking for Mullers. 'The front of the shop here is glass fronted and he must have only been about three inches away from that, it was very close. We were lucky really. 'We do get articulated lorries coming down here, but to be honest they usually don’t try and turn in like this chap did.'","Driver turned down narrow bend in Market Drayton, Shropshire .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A prankster seeking revenge on his best friend took inspiration from one of the most adored jokers of the nineties, by painting the man's house in Mr Blobby colours. Builder Jon Ansett was shown up by his friend, Peter Price-Whittle, when the 30-year-old wrote his initials on thousands of pounds worth of his scaffolding. Exacting revenge, the 37-year-old painted the exterior of his house in Dartford, Kent, bright pink with yellow blobs in an homage to Mr Blobby, the bumbling sidekick of Noel Edmonds in Noel's House Party. Jon Ansett waited until his friend was on holiday to paint his house bright pink with yellow spots . Mr Ansett decided to get his own back when he discovered 'PPW' written all over his scaffolding poles. Eager to get revenge, he waited until his friend was on holiday in Dubai to paint the semi-detached house. Astonishingly, Price-Whittle's housemate failed to spot what was going on, and thought the prankster was a window cleaner. When he returned home from holiday, the 30-year-old could not believe his eyes. 'I came back from holiday and my Facebook was just going crazy when I landed. 'I was like ""huh?"" and then I saw that while I was away he’d decided to paint my house pink and put Blobby spots on it, thinking he was funny,' Mr Price-Whittle said. Jon Ansett spent a week and £150 painting the house after his friend signed his initials on his scaffolding poles .

After repainting his house, he has vowed to pull another prank on his friend. 'I don’t think some of the neighbours were particularly pleased but it was just a practical joke and of course I’m going to paint over it - it’s not going to stay. Mr Blobby was on Noel's House Party in the nineties . 'All the old grannies were laughing when they walked past and it’s made a lot of people smile, so that’s good. 'Anyway, I’ve got plans to get him back.' Mr Ansett, who spent around £150 on the joke, said: 'I was doing a job for Pete so I put all the scaffolding up around his house and then I see he’s put his initials all over it. 'He thought it would be funny, so I thought, right. 'I waited for him to go on holiday and then I spent a good couple of hours painting his house pink and spray painting on the yellow dots. 'His housemate was in the house at the time - which I didn't know - but he just thought it was some window cleaners. 'He’s alright about it, it’s just a laugh and a good bit of fun. 'If he gets me back, I’ve got something up my sleeve.' Mr Blobby first appeared on Noel Edmonds’ Saturday night hit Noel’s House Party in 1993 and had a Christmas number one before disappearing from the spotlight in 1999.

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Sainbury's may be forced to remove its iconic orange branding after residents in an upmarket seaside town complained it wouldn't fit in. Residents of sleepy Frinton-on-Sea in Essex spoke out against plans for a new store to be built, claiming it will 'ruin' the appearance of the town. The store will be built on Connaught Avenue, where other retailers are forced to adhere to a strict 'shop front design guide' issued by Frinton and Walton Town Council. Scroll down for video . Shops in Connaught Avenue (pictured) have to adhere to the council's strict shop front design guide . Councillors said the supermarket's trademark orange branding would not fit in with its surroundings (file image) Councillors raised concerns at a town hall meeting last week. Some demanded the supermarket use black and gold lettering as its logo to match the original J. Sainsbury opened in 1869 in Drury Lane, London. 'The whole of Frinton will welcome a Sainsbury’s so they don’t have to plaster it with orange for everyone to know where it is,' said Mark Cossens, councillor for Holland and Kirkby. Brian Johnson, councillor for Hamford, said: 'This is Frinton-on-Sea and we try as hard as we can to protect it for people. 'We don't want it ruined'. Mr Johnson added: 'Most people are, or were, perfect gentlemen in Frinton-on-Sea.' Sainsbury’s representatives were sent away to revise the plans ahead of a planning application to Tendring District Council later this year. A representative for the supermarket told the meeting: 'The reason we are here is because we want to understand the wider views and be receptive of them.

In January plans to build a branch of the budget supermarket Aldi were frostily met, with councillors calling for more upmarket bidders such as Waitrose. Mayor Iris Johnson told Sainsbury’s bosses: 'The shop front is extremely important to us. 'We spent a lot of time on our shop front design guide. 'Connaught Avenue is a wonderful avenue with some beautiful buildings, but in the not too distant past some people have got away with doing things we would not like repeated.'","Plans for store in Frinton-on-Sea were met with complaints about its logo .

"By . Chris Hastings . Mrs Brown star Brendan O’Carroll could barely conceal his anger after identifying the Army officer who ‘assassinated’ his grandfather during the Irish War of Independence nearly 100 years ago. O’Carroll, who plays the foul-mouthed matriarch of the Brown family in the hit BBC comedy, had until now believed that Peter O’Carroll was shot by drunken members of the infamous Black and Tans who randomly targeted his hardware shop on October 16, 1920. But now he has discovered his ancestor was executed by intelligence officer Jocelyn Lee Hardy because two of Peter O’Carroll’s sons were members of the IRA. Scroll down for video . Bredan O'Carroll's grandfather, Peter, was shot in 1920 by a member of the Black and Tans because he refused to give up the whereabouts of his two sons who were also IRA members . The actor pieced together the events of the fateful evening during an edition of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are? to be screened later this month. He says: ‘That’s the last face my grandfather saw. Jesus, he’s some bastard. You know, in my case, it’s personal and I would have liked to have seen someone taken to account for it. 'We are beyond justice, I think, at this stage but at least we have got the truth.’ Hardy, then 26, is identified as the killer in documents known as The Witness Statements compiled by the government of the Irish Republic in the 1950s as a record of the memories of IRA members in the 1920s. The papers include a 1920 testimony of David Nelligan, who worked for the British authorities in Dublin Castle, then the seat of British rule, but who leaked classified information to Michael Collins, the IRA’s director of intelligence. Nelligan records that Collins was convinced that Hardy, who worked for an elite intelligence outfit known as the auxiliaries, was responsible for the death of O’Carroll and the shooting of a IRA fundraiser in a Dublin hotel days earlier. Brendan O’Carroll learns that his grandfather was killed because he refused to reveal the whereabouts of two of his sons who were members of the IRA. Jocelyn Lee Hardy (pictured) was identified as the man who shot Peter O'Carroll on the new series of Who Do You Think You Are? When the two men – who would have been the actor’s uncles – failed to turn up at Dublin Castle by an agreed date, their father was shot dead. O’Carroll, 58, can barely contain his anger when he comes face to face with a photograph of Hardy. ‘This is the man who killed my grandfather. Oh, Jesus. My grand-father is killed because his sons wouldn’t surrender,’ he says. ‘I am not a dreamer. My grandad would have been one of the enemy. It’s just coming home so callously real. ‘People subscribe to the theory that all is fair in love and war. I don’t think [the killing] was fair.’ Hardy, who was nicknamed Hoppy because of his artificial leg, was a celebrated soldier who had seen distinguished service during the First World War. He was taken captive by the Germans in 1914 and held as a prisoner of war for three-and-a-half years. But his audacious attempts to escape from PoW camps made him a national hero and led to several military promotions. Eventually promoted to major, he arrived in Dublin in April 1920 and quickly established a reputation as a brilliant but brutal intelligence officer. He was responsible for interrogations at Dublin Castle and is alleged to have threatened prisoners with red-hot pokers and pistols full of blank bullets. The IRA made several unsuccessful attempts on his life. Following the establishment of the Irish Republic, Hardy returned to Britain and enjoyed a new life as a banker, author and playwright. Several of his novels drew upon his experiences in Dublin. Hardy died, aged 63, in May 1958. lBrendan O’Carroll’s edition of Who Do You Think You Are? will be screened on BBC1 on Thursday, August 28 at 9pm.","Brendan O'Carroll believed grandfather was killed by drunk Black and Tans .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . It appeared to be a harmless spec on the camera lens as news anchor Jonathan Uptin read the evening bulletin on Thursday. But to some, it was an indicator of something far more sinister. As the Channel Nine anchor began to read his regular broadcast, a disk shaped, grey, unidentified object appeared above his left shoulder on the backdrop. A grey, disk shaped, unidentified object appeared behind Channel Nine's news anchor Jonathan Uptin on Thursday night . The object instantly sparked rumours that the broadcast had captured footage of a UFO sighting. Despite the spec disappearing after a few moments, Mr Uptin told NT News he feared for his safety. 'I just hope it doesn't return tonight and I'm abducted,' he said. With his back turned to the scene, Mr Uptin admitted he hadn't originally noticed the dark shape. However, after being notified by his news director halfway through reading the news, he admitted he tried to take a quick look, but by this point it had disappeared. The object instantly sparked rumours that the broadcast had captured footage of a UFO sighting, with Mr Uptin joking that he feared for his safety . 'It is a real concern obviously but because I was facing the camera I didn't know what was going on behind me, so I wasn't as petrified as I should have been,' Mr Uptin told NT News. He then added: 'I thought it was bad when my Melbourne colleague Peter Hitchener was attacked by a seagull but this is obviously a much deeper concern.' 'I survived tonight's broadcast, but have serious reservations if I'll be in the chair on Monday,' Mr Uptin told Daily Mail Australia on Friday night. He later revealed the mystery behind the smear, saying 'The truth is it was a bug that we couldn't get off the lens of our camera'.","A grey, circular, unidentified object appeared behind news anchor Jonathan Uptin on Thursday night .

Not that they serve any real purpose anyway,' Mr Dark posted. Dark critcises gay marriage, saying 'I like the current social fabric of Australia and see no logical reason as to why this should be ruined.' Mr Dark also launches a bizarre rant about women with hairy underarms.

In a statement, Mr Dark said, 'I sincerely apologise for any offence that I may have caused. Any comments were off the cuff remarks which were not to be taken seriously,' according to The Age. The latest controversy come after student members of the Melbourne University Liberal Club were revealed to be behind a series of sexist and racist social media comments. The offensive posts have been branded 'disturbing' by a senior lecturer at the university. The comments are said to have been made by the treasurer and vice president of the Liberal Club. Tim Dark resigned from his position as vice-president of a Liberal club at a Melbourne university after posts such as this one were made public, in which Dark says he has a problem with lesbians 'lifestyle choices.'

Tim Dark's comments, in which he continues to make homophobic statements on Facebook and post bizarre comments about females with underarm hair. The Swinburne University Liberal Club celebrates the appointment of their leadership team in April, including vice president, Tim Dark. Tim Dark has stepped down from the position after a Facebook rant, posted in October 2013, has been made public. Fairfax alleges that in a comment made in January, the group's vice president described a venue as 'worth a visit' before saying the bar had 'lots of sluts', adding: 'get some sluts for me' in another post. According to Fairfax, the treasurer of the Liberal Club also sent derogatory posts, in which he allegedly said 'Just be careful of those mussrats. A lot of them are [a] bunch of Third World degenerate c***s.' when referring to Muslim people. Further comments from the same person describe academic and high-profile feminist Germaine Greer as a 'lying f***ing c*m guzzling slut … and a union member' adding: ''She doesn't believe in God. No kids not married … what do you [e]xpect from a melb uni educated former socialist c***,'. Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a senior lecturer in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia 'It's distressing that any students would make these comments. This is disturbing.' Politician often attend events organised by political university clubs, according to Dr Rosewarne, in order to boost membership as well as their own profiles. 'New talent comes from them, so it is a breeding ground for new candidates,' she said.

Dr Lauren Rosewarne, a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, called the comments 'disturbing' and said the clubs are 'breeding grounds' for new party candidates . When asked if she believed the crude comments were damaging to the Liberal Party, Dr Rosewarne said there was some distance between the two groups despite them being heavily involved. 'Because it's not a liberal party candidate or a member of parliament, the Liberal Party head office gets to put a distance between itself and the university club,' Dr Rosewarne said. 'Although it does have affiliations with the university club, it's unrealistic to expect them to be able to control what their party members – rather than their candidates - say or do, or even when students go rogue on social media. 'But they can disendorse the club.' She added: 'Even candidates themselves can't be controlled on social media – that's why they have media teams and press releases.' The comments come only a few days after the resignation of two Liberal Party candidates, Jack Lyons and Aaron Lane. Mr Lyons was revealed to have made dozens of racist and sexist posts on social media while Mr Lane was found to have repeatedly used homophobic language on his own social media pages. Daily Mail approached the Melbourne University Liberal Club's president for a comment but are yet to receive a response.","Vice-president of Swinburne University Liberal club, Tim Dark, forced to resign after making sexist and homophobic comments on social media .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . After welcoming their 16th child into the world on June 26, the Bonell family has revealed they are happy to have even more. Jeni, 45, and Ray Bonell, 46, from Toowoomba in Queensland, are the proud parents of 16 children, ranging in age from 24 to three until their newborn Katelyn Vera came along. Faced with a never-ending pile of laundry, ridiculous grocery bills and having no choice but to use a former school bus for their family car, the couple told the Today show that none of those daily problems would stop them adding to their brood. Scroll down for video . Jeni, 45, and Ray Bonell, 46, from Toowoomba in Queensland, recently welcomed their 16th child, Katelyn Vera, into the world . When asked if number 17 was on the way, Jeni replied 'I think it'll be a little while but hopefully yes,' before adding: 'We're just going to go along and if we are lucky enough to have another one that would be fantastic and if not, we are so grateful for what we have.' Despite being somewhat of an expert on the process of childbirth, the latest addition to the Bonell family proved to be a very different and worrying experience for Jeni and Ray. 'We were in labour and when the doctors checked we found out the chord was out ahead of her, so it was an umbilical cord prolapse,' Jeni told the Today team. 'It was kind of all hands on deck at that point and I was rushed in for an emergency caesarean.' Pictured here with their newborn, Mr and Mrs Bonell revealed they would love to keep having more children . Australia's biggest family is forced to use a former school bus as their family car . Dinner time at the Bonells' house is a busy affair now there are 18 mouths to feed . Ray revealed that despite 15 children, he was amazed at his wife's recovery as well as being greatly concerned for her welfare. 'I've got new admiration for her because her recovery has been a lot harder and I've had to take on some of the housework and some of the washing and I've earned a total new respect for her this time around,' he said. Last year Jeni, who also keeps a Facebook page for the entire family where she shares the daily pleasures and troubles of keeping up with so many children, told the Sydney Morning Herald that she is forced to use a colour code system and rosters to keep up with laundry, which children were sick and even who was getting on the bus when she picked them up from school. Despite the numbers, the Bonell family are close and all have to pitch in to keep the household running . The daily chore of laundry no doubt appears to be the worst chore in the house, with the mother-of-sixteen sharing snaps of the pile of linen that took her two days to wash . Jeni's Facebook posts also have her talking about the perks of having so many children, including in a Mother's Day post in which she says she was pampered: 'I am one lucky mum!' The Bonell's story appeared in Woman's Day and on the Today show . However the daily chore of laundry no doubt appears to be the worst chore in the house, with the mother-of-sixteen sharing snaps of the pile of linen that took her two days to wash as well as her method of disciplining misbehaving children - giving them the duty of folding socks. 'Mum and dad could not possibly do all of it, so they all have jobs to do and they all help,’ Jeni said of the housework. Finances are also clearly a struggle for the forever expanding family, who revealed to Woman's Day that they can go through up to 63 litres of milk a week. 'It's a struggle some days to afford these kids, but if you have this many kids and you love them all and take care of them , god provides for a lot of those things,' Ray told Today. 'We don't always just get things now and straight away. We have to wait for things, we have to work hard for things and once we have them we appreciate them a lot more.'","Jeni Bonell, 45, and her husband Ray, 46, are the parents of 16 children .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . Child sex offenders who attempt to change their name without receiving permission from authorities could face up to five years in prison under a new crackdown on child protection laws. The new amendments would see a significant increase to the existing penalty for such an offence, which is currently only a $550 fine. New regulations suggested for the Child Protection Bill, introduced by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services Stuart Ayres, would see the fine increased to $55,000 and include a jail term. Convicted pedophiles who change their name without permission could face up to five years in prison and a $55,000 fine . The changes come two years after the death of high-profile child sex offender Dennis Ferguson, who was twice caught using a different unregistered name while working for charities including the RSPCA and Diabetes Australia. The suggested changes to the Child Protection Bill, come as part of a crackdown on child protection laws introduced by the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, Stuart Ayres, on Wednesday . An individual on the child protection register must also now report 'details of any motor vehicle hired' and 'details of any telecommunications service' including registering their mobile and land-line phone numbers with police, under the new Bill. It clarifies the type of contact with someone under the age of 18 that the individual must register, which includes any type of supervision or care of a child, visiting or staying in a house where there is a child present and exchanging contact details with a child. The use of electronics, including emails and internet communications have also been covered in the Bill. Alongside convicted pedophiles, individuals who qualify for registration on the child protection register has also been amended to include those responsible for manslaughter of a child, child abduction and anyone responsible for 'wounding' or causing 'grievous bodily harm of a child under 10 years of age'. The amendments come two years after the death of high-profile child sex offender Dennis Ferguson, who was twice caught using a different unregistered name while working for charities . The announcement was met with public scrutiny however, after a spokesperson for Mr Ayres told The Sydney Morning Herald that parents and carers convicted of 'shaking' a child, would fall under this category. Sue Foley, a expert on shaken baby syndrome said registering carers for shaking a child would be 'over the top', and that educating them on coping with stressful situations would be more effective. However in his introductory speech of the Bill, Mr Ayres clarified that: ''Inclusion of these offences will ensure that offenders who may continue to pose significant risk to children are not omitted from ongoing monitoring'.","Amendments to the Child Protection Bill suggest a five year jail sentence for sex offenders who change their name without permission .

At 25-years-old, Vlatka Dragic found herself spontaneously quitting her job and driving to Queensland with a friend, in search of warmwe weather and a healthier lifestyle. Sick of the daily nine-to-five drudge, the Croatian-born beauty left her high-end career as an account manager for various supermarket brands and spent months in the sunny state desperately struggling to find employment.

'We have to have really good muscle tone and muscle separation for the competition, which is really hard to get and involves 12 weeks of strict dieting.

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . As property prices continue to steadily grow, renters looking to save know full well to avoid central city locations or anywhere with a harbour view. But new figures have revealed that it's the inner Sydney suburbs and those in the Pilbara region of Western Australia that renters should steer completely clear of. A list of ten suburbs compiled by property information and analytics provider RP data, has revealed that New South Wales and Western Australia dominate the list of the nation's top ten most expensive suburbs. The top ten most expensive suburbs to rent a home in are all in New South Wales and Western Australia according to a new RP Data report, with Port Hedland, WA topping the list . Topping the list of suburbs with the highest return for landlords, with a gross rental yield of 9.3 percent for the year to April, was Port Headland in WA. With a rich mining centre located nearby, the seaside suburb 1,322 kilometres north-east of Perth has a median weekly advertised rental rate of $1,775. The second priciest place to live in the country, unsurprisingly fell to the Sydney suburb of Mosman, with renters paying a median $1500 of rent a week. The next two spots went to Western Australia again, for Newman ($1500) and South Hedland ($1350), both also mining towns. The Sydney suburb of Mosman was the second most expensive suburb to rent in, with a a median weekly rental rate of $1500 . Woollahra, in Sydney's eastern suburbs came 5th on the list with a weekly rental rate of  $1300, sitting in a quiet spot only five kilometres from the CBD. Baynton and Nickol, both in WA, came close behind at $1200 and $1100 respectively. The last three spots in the top ten went to the NSW suburbs of Seaforth, Roseville and St Ives, with rental prices between $1000 and $1100. Newman in WA, also had a a median weekly rental rate of $1500. The subrub was follwed by South Hedland in WA, Woollahra in NSW and Baynton in WA . Rental growth has been quite moderate across the country over the last year, according to RP's reports, with house rent increasing by an average 2.6 per cent over the year to June 2014. However when broken down across the capital cities, Sydney's rose by a huge 4 per cent while Perth actually recorded a reduction of -5 per cent in house rents over the last year. Unit rents have meanwhile seen little change over the last quarter, with rises only recorded in the Sydney and Melbourne markets.","The top ten most expensive suburbs to rent in are all in Western Australia and New South Wales, according to a new RP Data report .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . In a sales pitch gone wrong, a pilot salesman was lucky to escape uninjured alongside his two passengers after the aircraft he was flying crashed into a backyard. The pilot, 62-year-old Peter Edwards according to the Daily Telegraph, was demonstrating how the Cirrus SR22 aircraft he was flying could recover from a stall on May 10 when he lost control of the plane, according to a report of the incident released by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. 'Watch this,' Mr Edwards was reported to have said shortly before the plane's right wing dropped rapidly, sending the aircraft into a spin. Scroll down for video . The crash scene in the Blue Mountains on May 10 after a pilot and salesman failed to regain control of the Cirrus SR22 plane while demonstrating a stall . After the planes third rotational spin, it became clear that the pilot would not be able to regain control from the maneuver. The passenger in the front seat of the aircraft claimed it was at this point that Mr Edwards clearly stated 'I'm sorry'. About 2,000 feet above the ground, the pilot released the aircraft's parachute. Narrowly avoiding some nearby power lines, the plane collided with the branches of a tree before crashing down onto a resident's fence. The plane landed in the front yard of Blue Mountains property belonging to Sheila Riordan who appeared more concerned that her nap had been interrupted in an interview with the Blue Mountains Gazette. The 66-year-old told the publication that she heard loud bangs but didn't think anything of it, saying that her first thought was 'there's no peace'. None of the three people aboard were injured after the plane landed in the front yard of Blue Mountains resident Sheila Riordan's property . 'When I first saw it I thought ""that's a surprise"". But I really am glad that no-one got hurt. It could have been awful, the bush could have gone up, people could have got hurt. It’s the only place they could have landed neatly,' Ms Riordan said. The passenger in the front seat claimed that once the plane had come to its resting position, he had to shake the pilot who he described as appearing 'dazed', urging him to 'hurry up and open the door and exit the aircraft'. He claims he was also forced to switch the ignition and master switches and fuel selector off, as the pilot had previously failed to do so. The report stated that Mr Edwards claimed he had performed the same manoeuvre earlier that day with no problems, however he admitted that 'he was probably overconfident as he had done the demonstration 30-50 times in the previous six months'.","The pilot was demonstrating how the aircraft  could recover from a stall when he lost control of the plane .

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . The parents of a two-year-old boy who was living with his grandparents, have been arrested in Malaysia after allegedly kidnapping him and fleeing the country last weekend. The South Australian couple, aged 26 and 23, were arrested by Malaysian authorities on Thursday and have been charged with aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction. In accordance with South Australian law, the offence could see them sentenced to a prison term of up to 19 years. Arrangements for the toddler's safe return to Australia are currently being made. Scroll down for video . A South Australian couple have been arrested in Malaysia after kidnapping their two-year-old son and fleeing the country last weekend, Chief Superintendent John Venditto revealed . Australian police have also charged the child's 64-year-old grandfather and 52-year-old grandmother' with aiding and abetting in the unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction', according to a police statement. The grandparents failed to notify authorities, for more than 24 hours, that the two-year-old had left their care. It has also been alleged that they 'handed the boy over to his parents on Saturday August 2'. Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' at the time he was taken. Police refused to reveal why the parents had lost custody of their child or if they had a criminal record at a press conference on Friday, however they did reveal that 'the child was under an assessment and investigation order that was issued by the courts' Chief Superintendent John Venditto said at a press conference that the entire operation took only six days from the moment police were informed that the child was missing until the arrest of his parents. 'It is an extraordinarily quick and rapid response to something that would generally take a lot longer,' he said. Chief Inspector Tony Crameri, the officer in charge of the investigation, said the child's well-being was the priority throughout the operation. 'This was an incredibly delicate investigation and we were mindful that the parents could flee at any moment with the boy to an unknown location,' he said. The parents could face up to 19 years in jail according to South Australian law, while the grandparents, who  have also been charged, are expected to appear at the Holden Hill Magistrates court (pictured) in October . 'Such a quick and positive outcome could not have been achieved without the cooperation of a number national and international agencies, including Interpol, the Royal Malaysian Police, Malaysian Government, Commonwealth Attorney Generals Department, Department of Foreign Affairs, South Australia DPP and the Australian Federal Police,' he said. The parents have so far appeared at a Malaysian court and will now be remanded for the customary 60 days until the case will resume. Australian authorities are awaiting for decisions surrounding their extradition and any further charges to be decided by Malaysian authorities. Meanwhile, the toddler's grandparents have been granted bail and are set to appear in the Holden Hill Magistrates Court on 14 October. Their charges could also lead to a lengthy jail sentence, according to police.","The couple, from South Australia, have been charged with aggravated unlawful removal of a child from a jurisdiction .

"By . Linda Kelsey . When, early one morning, my partner and I told our 11-year-old son we were going to get married after 15 years together, he excitedly rushed to school and broke the good news to his teachers. Months later, after proudly acting as ring bearer at the register office and delivering the best man speech at our wedding party, Thomas declared it had been the best weekend of his life. So eight years on, in 2007, when my husband Christian walked out, the personal sense of loss and anguish that I felt was accompanied by a profound sense that we had let down our son. I was convinced he would now see love as an illusion, a sham, and that his view of marriage would be skewed for ever. Thomas (right) said that his mother Linda' s wedding to his father Christian was the 'best weekend of his life' My husband believed that if our relationship was to end, it should be when our son was going off to university. He said this would be ‘best’ for Thomas, in so far as he was grown up enough to lead an independent life. I thought it might be the worst of all times, given that it would coincide with him starting to form tentative romantic and sexual relationships. If his own parents — who for a large part of his life, had seemed so loving and happy — could drift apart, what kind of confusing message would that convey to him about the possibility of having a successful marriage as he embarked on an important stage in his life? New research from The Marriage Foundation — which suggests that half of today’s 20-year-olds will never marry — reminded me of all this. It may have come as a shock to the researchers, but it is no surprise to me. Given that 42 per cent of marriages will end in divorce, my generation — and the generation of 40-somethings behind me — haven’t exactly been good role models. Growing up in the 50s and 60s, I can’t recall a single divorced couple among my parents’ friends. My own mother and father, who were always companionable and affectionate, were married for 60 years before my dad died. Bad example? Linda, who has been divorced twice, with her son Thomas, 26 . My assumption then, based on example and expectations within society, was that love led to marriage and that marriage was for eternity. My own brutal awakening was a disastrous first marriage that began when I was 19 and ended six years later when I realised we were incompatible in every way. Although I was shaken by this break-up, I was still able to look at my parents’ wonderful example of long-lasting love and believe in its possibility. Sadly, my son and his generation have far fewer such examples to hang on to. Now 26, Thomas is still single and house-sharing with friends. And, as for most of his generation, marriage is currently the last thing on his mind. He doesn’t describe himself or his friends as commitment-phobic, as such, but he does regard himself as one of the ‘wary generation’. Happier times: Linda with her ex-husband Christian . So many of his pals’ parents are divorced too that he knows, however loving a relationship, it may not last. On the one hand, it saddens me that his eyes are as wide open to the possibility of failure as they are to success. On the other, I think it’s no bad thing if romantic aspirations are tempered by pragmatism rather than fuelled by fairytales with a ‘happy ever after’. Last week’s report points to a general decline in marriage and a dramatic fall in the wedded state among those in their 20s. In 1970, the peak year for marriage, 564,818 men and women aged 25 tied the knot. In 2010, just 56,598 did — a 90 per cent drop. It’s astonishing that there’s been such a shift in so short a time. But today’s 20-somethings are just reacting to what they’ve seen from us parents. A few years ago, I was editor of a glossy wedding magazine, and we decided to take a stand at a wedding fair. Unlike the other enterprises, selling favours, frocks, flowers and cakes, we had nothing much to offer beyond magazine subscriptions. So we opted to offer emotional support from our agony aunt. Dozens of girls queued for our stand and most ended up in tears as they talked, fortified with a glass of wine. The number one stress factor, it turned out, was warring divorced parents and arguments about whether new partners should be invited or banned, who would be allowed to sit at the top table and in a couple of cases whether stepdad or real dad — or mum — should take the bride down the aisle. Many brides-to-be said it was causing problems with the families and rows with their boyfriends, too, and they were thinking of calling the whole thing off. 9.7 per cent of the adult Welsh population are divorced - that's higher than in Northern Ireland, England or Scotland . No wonder they were reluctant to marry. Of course, parental divorce is not entirely to blame. The acceptability of sex before marriage has made the teens and 20s a time for freedom, experimentation and fun rather than settling down for life. And girls’ desire for babies is often put on hold until careers have taken off. Perhaps the biggest stumbling block for 20-somethings is economic. Some 3.3 million youngsters aged between 20 and 34 — nearly a quarter — still live with their parents. They can’t afford to get married, even if they want to. For those who do manage to set up home with a boyfriend or girlfriend, living together is no longer simply a prelude to marriage, it’s an alternative to it. Student debt and high house prices mean saving for a deposit, rather than a wedding, is the priority. When the daughter of a friend rang her mum to say she had exciting news about her and her boyfriend — with whom she had been renting a flat for two years — my friend assumed she was about to announce her engagement. ‘I’m SO SO happy,’ her daughter gushed down the phone. ‘Ben has asked me to buy a flat with him. He’s inherited a bit of money and I’ve saved a few thousand. Isn’t it wonderful?’ Thomas has told Linda that his family still means a lot to him . Marriage wasn’t even mentioned. That seems to tie in with my son’s thinking. Thomas says marriage is not high on his list of what he believes constitutes commitment. He explained: ‘Commitment is living together. It’s buying  a home together. Or having a child together. For me a wedding seems more like a big public performance than anything else.’ I can’t reverse the fact I’ve had two divorces. Nor can I undo the effect of those marriage failures on my son. So I’ve tried to mitigate the impact by remaining on civil terms with his dad and not burdening Thomas with our hurts and resentments. Last Christmas, for example, Thomas was torn between coming to me for a Christmas feast with my sister, her family and close friends, or joining his dad, who was going to be on his own. So I invited his dad to join us, which he did. Thomas tells me family still means a lot to him. He gets on well with Ron, my partner of the last few years, and Ron’s two daughters. I make a point of fixing extended family gatherings, and at every opportunity mixing up the generations. Thomas always seems happy to join in. I’ve told Thomas that Ron has asked me to marry him but I have turned him down, because, although I intend to stay with Ron for the rest of my life, I do not want to make that very public commitment for a third time. Thomas simply smiled and nodded knowingly, but I think he may be relieved that, having witnessed his parents’  wedding, he doesn’t have to witness another ceremony. I may not have been a good role model for marriage, but hope I’ve tried to show love and forgiveness. Whether or not Thomas ultimately marries is a decision for him and any future partner. I’d be lying if I said I wouldn’t shed a tear of happiness to see him walking down the aisle. But, sadly, I have to admit that I’d be a hypocrite if I were ever to suggest it.","Linda Kelsey's son Thomas was delighted when she married his father, yet eight years later they were divorced .

"By . Linda Kelsey . Flashing a big smile on ITV’s This Morning earlier this week, Oxo mum and Loose Women star Lynda Bellingham demonstrated all her usual zest and warmth, despite undergoing gruelling chemotherapy for cancer. But as well as her dazzling white teeth, the 65-year-old also showed off a dazzling halo of silver-white hair. Fans quickly took to Twitter to congratulate the former chocolatey brunette on her new ‘silver vixen’ status. Lynda’s been fortunate not to have lost her hair and it’s almost certainly white because women are advised to avoid dying it until six months after finishing chemo. This is because hair is more fragile and the scalp more sensitive during this time. But even as I was applauding Lynda’s courage, I couldn’t help thinking that the moment she gets the go-ahead she’ll be back to her hairdresser faster than you can say ‘L’Oreal Rich Espresso’, demanding a return to her tinted natural self. If you’re wondering how you can possibly be both ‘tinted’ and ‘natural’, let me assure you that you can. The hair colour a woman enjoys in her youth — whether brunette or blonde or auburn — is so often inextricably tied up with her identity. It is these shades that define who we are, not the grey that tries to colonise faster than Japanese knotweed. Silver vixen: Lynda Bellingham this week . I discovered this for myself when I underwent a tortuous six-month experiment to grow out my roots after tinting my hair from the age of 27 until my mid-50s. My visits to my colourist every three weeks had ruled my diary and depleted my bank balance for decades, and I had hoped going colour-free would free me — but my main realisation was that the ‘grey me’ was an ugly alien I didn’t recognise. The ‘real me’, the brunette, had walked away, leaving me bereft. There was a moment, with my roots grown out to badger stripe stage, when for the first time in my life, a young man offered me his seat on the train. Grateful? I wanted to beat him around the head with my handbag. Instead I smiled and sat down, defeated. The old cliché about grey-haired men looking distinguished while grey-haired women just look old is depressing, but the sad fact is that it’s as true today as ever. When I cast my eyes across the roll-call of grey-haired female celebrities I find myself wishing that they would all do themselves a favour and reach for the tint. Diane Keaton looks haggard, the formidable Anna Ford looks as though a wisp of wind would blow her away and Angela Rippon resembles a dowager — a shame given that she can still high-kick like a Tiller Girl. Theresa May, with her blonde bits, grey fringe and variable roots merely looks confused, which for a Government minister doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. And while Jamie Lee Curtis’s crisp crop suits her, she could look less fearsome and more youthful with some highlights. Meanwhile, the likes of George Clooney and David Ginola look even more devastatingly attractive with a sprinkling of silver. By the age of 50, around half of all white women are likely to have grey hair . Admittedly, some men have wobbly moments when they first turn grey. When my partner of five years, Ronny, now 59, was in his early 40s and already more silver than average, he was tempted by a bottle of Grecian 2000 in Boots. ‘I suppose I just felt a bit too young to be grey,’ he explained. He waited until he went on holiday before trying it, knowing he wouldn’t bump into anyone he knew. ‘Actually the results were quite good,’ he says, ‘but I washed it out again as soon as possible because I really didn’t like the idea of anyone noticing it.’ Another man I know — tall, good-looking and close to 50 — admitted he was worried about grey around his temples. Despite being the boss of a team of computer programmers, he was about 20 years older than most of his staff and felt he must look like an old man in their presence. But at no point did he question the effect his hair would have on his success on the dating scene. As a newly-divorced man, he was as confident as he ever was with his dark locks. So while grey hair can be an issue for today’s metrosexual men, and hairdressers report that growing numbers of men are dyeing their hair, it hardly seems to worry most. This probably has to do with the fact that men remain fertile for longer — when a woman goes grey it signals the end of her fecundity, while it doesn’t have to for men — and men are programmed to seek out those who are able to reproduce. Add in the cultural pressures on women to stay young and beautiful, and grey-haired women are playing a losing game. Battling the signs of aging: Linda Kelsey fighting the grey . As a feminist I feel I should be waving banners for the glad-to-be-grey sisterhood, but I’m not sure I’d find many sisters to join me. The home hair-colouring market was worth £350 million in 2013 say researchers Mintel, with about half of products used by the 40-60 age group — a spend 4.5 per cent up on 2012. When, five years ago, I started my experiment to grow out my roots, friends thought I was nuts. This was especially so because it came within a year of separating from my husband and only weeks after having embarked on a new relationship with someone who took me on as a brunette. But given that Ronny, my new man, was himself grey-haired, I thought it might prove a good test of what he really thought of me. As it turned out, he was patient and tried to be complimentary. He also breathed a big sigh of relief when I went back on the bottle — of tint, that is. What did I learn from this torture, apart from the fact that time and money could be saved? That unless you have thick, bouncy hair (mine is fine and as bouncy as lead), you’ll look a great many years older than you did before. That unless your hair grows close to white, hair the colour of scaffolding will make your features look grey as well. That if you don’t have masses of confidence in your looks, grey hair will make you feel invisible. It’s one of the injustices between the sexes that a woman’s chances of meeting someone will be diminished if she presents herself as grey, bad news for the increasing number of over-50s who’ve turned to online dating. One 50-something acquaintance, already grey-haired, posted her profile and got scant response. When she dyed her hair and posted a new picture, the response rate went right up. Soon she was dating a handsome grey-haired man. There are a number of women, following chemotherapy, who are so grateful to be still alive, and to see their hair growing back at all, that they wear their grey locks almost as a badge of victory. But I know plenty who find that dyeing their hair again gives them a boost of confidence. And that’s why I’m betting that Lynda Bellingham will be a re-minted brunette in the very near future. As for me, the tyranny of the tint seems a small price to pay for feeling better about myself. Which is why I intend to keep on dyeing until the day I die.","Cancer survivor Lynda Bellingham showed off new hair on This Morning .

"By . Linda Kelsey . Running my eyes over the rail of dark designer trouser suits and crisp shirts, I feel a frisson of pleasure. Their square shoulders and precise cuts speak of power, poise and sexual confidence. But this isn’t my partner’s wardrobe I’m rifling through — it’s mine. Dressing like a man has long been my style secret. Ninety per cent of the time I’m the one wearing the trousers — teamed with a shirt, a blazer and loafers or brogues. Dressing like a man: Linda Kelsey is in style heaven wearing designer trousers and crisp shirts . Though it might sound strange to some, dressing like a man has always made me feel like more of a woman. In the workplace, it imbues you with instant authority. Outside, it has a coquettish charm many men are unable to resist. And after a decade in the fashion doldrums, I’m back in style heaven. According to Debenhams, sales of trouser suits have soared 157 per cent in recent months, fuelled by designers such as Stella McCartney, whose recent collection was filled with slouchy, silky trouser suits in cream and navy. Angelina Jolie’s tuxedo-suited turn at the Baftas and model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne’s prediliction for androgynous dressing have also sparked the comeback. Last month saw the launch of 56-year-old model Ines de la Fressange’s collaboration with Uniqlo, championing low-key, boyish style. Cara Delevingne rocks a suit at the Mulberry dinner to celebrate the launch of the Cara Delevingne Collection . I’m not trying to make a feminist statement by the way I dress. It’s simply that to feel my most feminine, I need to feel comfortable. Trussed up in a constricting bodycon dress, I feel victim instead of master of my clothes. Men’s clothing, with its clever tailoring tricks, is far more flattering. My love affair with dressing more like a boy than a girl began in the Seventies, when androgyny was first in vogue. I’d been a conservative dresser in my late teens and early 20s — all cashmere sweaters and printed scarves. By the time my first marriage came to an end when I was 25, I was ready to establish a style of my own. Working at Cosmopolitan magazine, I began to spend time with artists and designers. I had my hair cropped, swapped London’s trendy King’s Road boutiques for school outfitters where I could buy striped blazers, and ditched the women’s department for the men’s to stock up on spotty bow ties. A style of her own: Working at Cosmopolitan magazine, Linda cropped her hair and ditched the women's department for the men's . Soon, I was modelling myself on Annie Hall, Diane Keaton’s character in the Woody Allen film of the same name. Annie was feisty, funny and feminine — despite dressing like she’d stolen her clothes from her brother’s wardrobe. When the designer Margaret Howell opened a Mayfair shop selling corduroy trousers, knitted waistcoats and striped shirts for women, her expensive emporium became my spiritual home. I was prepared to spend a week’s pay on a shirt. No man in whom I invested an iota of interest ever attempted to remodel me as a girly-girl. But if the Seventies were all about androgyny, in the Eighties a different trend took hold. Power dressing had less to do with sexual ambiguity than asserting authority — and equality — in the workplace. On becoming editor of Cosmopolitan in 1985, at 32, I realised that baggy cords and waistcoats weren’t going to cut it. I took to tailored trouser suits and knife-sharp shoulder pads. I had a designer trouser suit for every day of the week: Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Joseph were my favourites. Nigella's signature style is dresses that cling to her curves . In my high-end tailoring, I could knock against the glass ceiling. I could stride into a meeting and didn’t have to check on my cleavage when I raised my hand, or sneak a peak under the table to see if my skirt was creeping up. Jackets and trousers were my passport to power — and I’ve clung to them ever since. And then, about ten years ago, a troubling thing happened. Girls started dressing for work like they were going out clubbing. They were turning up in skyscraper heels, flashes of cleavage, short, tight skirts with splits, and transparent blouses. So hurrah, then, for this androgynous revival, which again feels fresh and new. On young girls it looks gamine and cute; on older women it looks polished and smart. The High Street is awash with masculine style. Men’s shirts are back, but in soft fabrics and are less likely to gape across the chest. There are great, slim-fitting, on-trend suits at Ted Baker and more conservatively cut ones at Hobbs. If you crave colour, Zara’s well-priced jackets come in sunny yellow, hot pink and sky blue. So, Nigella, Karren Brady, Carol Vorderman and the like can cling to clothes that cling to their curves. At 61, I can once again relish being one of the boys.","Square shoulders and precise cuts speak of sexual confidence .

"By . David Mccormack . A former male Australian fashion model who had built a reputation on his androgynous looks has undergone sex reassignment surgery and is now a transgender woman. Andreja – formerly Andrej – Pejic, 22, went public about her decision on Wednesday and revealed that going forward she will only be modeling women's fashion. Pejic has been making waves in the modeling world due to her androgynous looks since being discovered as a teenager working at McDonald's. Scroll down for video . Andreja – formerly Andrej – Pejic, 22, went public about her decision on Wednesday and revealed that going forward she will only be modeling women's fashion . Until now she had modeled both men's and women's collections in fashion shows and appeared on the cover of magazines such as Elle and New York. ‘I figured out who I was very early on - actually, at the age of 13, with the help of the internet - so I knew that a transition, becoming a woman, was always something I needed to do,’ the Serbian-born model told Style.com. ‘But it wasn’t possible at the time, and I put it off, and androgyny became a way of expressing my femininity without having to explain myself to people too much.’ Pejić was born in Bosnia in 1991 and fled along with her brother, mother and grandmother first to Serbia before emigrating to Australia in 2000 as political refugees. Until now Pejic has modeled both men's and women's collections in fashion shows and appeared on the cover of magazines such as Elle and New York . In 2011, Pejic walked the runway during the Jean-Paul Gaultier women's show as part of the Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week Spring/Summer show . ‘To all trans youth out there, I would like to say respect yourself and be proud of who you are. All human beings deserve equal treatment no matter their gender identity or sexuality. 'To be perceived as what you say you are is a basic human right,’ she said in a statement released via GLAAD. With regards changing her name by adding an 'a' to the end, Pejic said, 'it’s not a full transformation  - it’s just an evolution.' 'Andrej is a Christian Orthodox name, and in that religion, it’s definitely a male name. So I kept the ""j"" and added an ""a,"" which actually becomes a name that I don’t think exists. But I wanted to keep the ""j"" because that’s me. That’s my name.' Pejic also posted a selfie on Facebook on Thursday with a message to her fans:  'As a transgender woman I hope to show that after transition (a life-saving process) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter.' Pejic, who appeared in David Bowie's The Stars Are Out Tonight video last year, has received support from her agency, friends and family regarding her decision.

Malik Jones, 18, will be sentenced next month for his part . Last year, Anthony Malcolm was found guilty of first-degree murder and . robbery for his part in the sickening attack. He is currently serving 30 years in jail. According to prosecutors, Ayala was with two other teenagers in July of 2012 when they decided to play a game called 'Pick 'em out, knock 'em out'. The three targeted Mr Mora, a father of 12 and grandfather of 23, in an alley in the West Rogers Park neighbourhood and ordered him to empty his pockets. Ayala's friend Malik Jones allegedly then punched him in the jaw, causing him to fall to the ground and hit his head on the concrete. The group then proceeded to rifle through the victim's wallet as he lay dying in the alley. Victim: Mr Mora, who was disabled, was found unconscious in an alley in . Chicago in July 2012. He died in hospital the next day as a result of blunt . head trauma . Crime scene: The teenagers targeted Mr Mora in an alley in the West Rogers Park neighbourhood in Chicago, where he had been collecting soda cans . Murdered: Mr Mora was found by a passer-by with blood on his face and vomit next to his head . Mr Mora was found by a passer-by with . blood on his face and vomit next to his head about three hours later . and was taken to hospital. However, he died the next day as a result of blunt head trauma. A cellphone was used to record the fatal assault on Mr Mora, who didn't have full use of his right arm after a workplace accident 15 years ago. He then posted the sickening footage on to Facebook. 'He left him in the alley like a piece of garbage,' said prosecutor James Murphy at an earlier hearing. 'To them it was funny, they laughed.' Judge Joseph Claps ruled in that the three teens were 'accountable' for the death of Mr Mora. 'It’s a sad travesty that Mr. Delfino . Mora died because of the actions of people who apparently think that . what they were doing was a game,' he said. 'Well, it wasn’t a . game for Mr. Mora and his family.' The one-minute recording of the attack, which was posted on to Facebook, was the most damning piece of evidence presented during the case. Laughter from the three teens charged in the brutal death could be heard on the tape. Going to jail: The second of three men charged in the ""Pick 'Em Out and Knock 'Em Out"" slaying of a 62-year-old father of 12 has been sentenced to 27 years in prison after pleading guilty . Chilling: Malcolm recorded the brutal attack on a cellphone, before posting it on Facebook. One other friend is now awaiting trial . Mr Mora, who had been collecting soda . cans when he was approached by the youths, had emigrated to Chicago in . the 1980s from Michoacán, Mexico. He . supplemented his disability payments by collecting the waste cans early . in the morning and was attacked just blocks from his home. He was a father to six girls and six boys, who range in age from 17 to 40, and was also a grandfather. Speaking in July after the first teen was convicted, Mr Mora's son Emanuel said: 'We . feel a little bit of peace in our hearts. The judge made the right decision. But on the other . side, we still feel a little bit down because with this decision, it’s . not going to bring our father back.'","Nicholas Ayala, 18, was one of three teens playing 'Pick 'Em Out and Knock 'Em Dead' last July .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A former soldier and game hunter shot himself dead in an apparent suicide following a domestic incident which led to a four-hour stand-off with armed police. Allan Ellis, 50, a licensed gun owner and butcher, threatened to harm himself when police arrived at his home following reports of a domestic incident at 10.55pm on Wednesday. Officers sealed off the residential street in Bacup, Lancashire, and coaxed a woman – believed to be his wife Heather- from the property as a negotiator tried to reason with Mr Ellis. Allan Ellis, 50, a licensed gun owner and butcher, threatened to harm himself when police arrived at his home following reports of a domestic incident. After four hours of negotiations, the former soldier took his own life . The former corporal with the Scots Guards spoke with specialised police officers for about four hours until negotiations broke down. Armed officers then entered the terraced house and found his body in an upstairs room at 3am on Thursday. Police confirmed they are not treating his death as suspicious and said no one else was injured in the incident. Mr Ellis' next-of-kin have been informed and are being looked after by a police family liaison officer. The former soldier served in the Army from 1980 to 1993 when a serious injury forced him to change career. He owned a game shop and went into hunting venison, rabbit, boar and other game, which he supplied to farmers' markets across East Lancashire. He also organised deer hunts, shooting events and ran a catering stand at food festivals. A Lancashire Police spokeswoman said the case has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), as is routine when a death occurs following police involvement. Police said the death of Mr Ellis (above) was not being treated as suspicious and said no one else was injured . She said: 'An investigation is under way and the family of the deceased are being supported by police liaison officers.' Neighbours spoke of their shock at hearing of Mr Ellis' death. An elderly resident, who has lived in the street for 40 years, told the Lancashire Telegraph: 'My husband went out at about 4.30am and there were three police cars outside. 'It really shocks you knowing that that's happened a few doors down. It's just awful. It must be terrible for Heather and her daughter.' Another resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's terrible to think it's happened right on your doorstep.' Mr Ellis is thought to originally be from the village of Rushyford, in County Durham, and named his game dealing and shooting ware store in Burnley Road East after his hometown when he opened it 12 months ago.

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A newspaper sales director who 'terrorised' a shopkeeper and ‘viciously’ smashed up an off-licence has managed to get his conviction successfully wiped from Google using the EU’s controversial 'right to be forgotten' ruling. Patrick McVeigh and his older brother Terence, both from Leeds, admitted causing affray in 2001 and were jailed for nine months and ordered to pay £300 in compensation. However, while the Leeds Crown Court case was widely reported in the media, the former newspaper sales boss has now managed to get record of his conviction wiped from the UK’s biggest search engine. Patrick McVeigh, a former newspaper sales director who was convicted of affray in 2001, has successfully managed to get reports of his offence wiped from Google's UK search results under the 'right to be forgotten' McVeigh, who was 30 at the time, and his brother had been on their way to watch Leeds United at Elland Road in the Holbeck area in February 2001 when they walked into the off-licence, removed CCTV cameras and caused carnage – smashing up displays, throwing bottles of liquor and hurling a till to the ground. The men, who were part of a much larger group, also contributed to causing injury to shopkeeper Dolat Patel who was left needing stitches when a bottle hit him in the lip. The brothers were convicted after video footage taken outside the football ground identified them and was handed to police. While reports of their convictions remained published online for many years, they have now been wiped from the search engine, the Daily Telegraph said, after McVeigh successfully used Google’s 'right to be forgotten' form - which lets people apply to get themselves removed from search results. The ability to remove information from the site came into force in May after a landmark ruling by the European Court of Justice which said people were entitled to the 'right to be forgotten'. It means people can have Google search results removed if they feel they tarnish their reputation. Following McVeigh’s successful application in getting his conviction wiped from the site, a disclosure notice now appears in search results for his name. Hundreds of thousands of people have requested links are removed from Google UK since the European Court of Justice's ruling in May. People can apply for results to be removed if they feel they tarnish their reputation . ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe,’ it states on Google.co.uk. However, those using Google.com see no such message and reports of McVeigh’s conviction still appear on the site. Since July 18, more than 91,000 applications have been made to the search engine requesting for links to be removed from Google’s European sites. While Google said it was unable to comment on individual cases, it is understood more than 12,000 requests – involving 44,000 urls - came from the UK while around 17,500 – involving 58,000 urls -came from France.

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A woman who tipped flour over her black neighbour and told her: 'You are now white British' in an unprovoked racist attack has been jailed. South African-born Pamela Bower was sitting in her garden having a cup of tea in Gillingham, Kent when Kellie Wells climbed over her six foot garden fence and began abusing her. Maidstone Crown Court heard how 42-year-old Wells told Miss Bower, who has lived in the UK for 15 years: 'Go back to your country you gorilla creature.' Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard how Kellie Wells threw flour at South African-born neighbour Pamela Bower - who has lived in the UK for 15 years - and told her: 'Go back to your country you gorilla creature' Miss Bower, 38, said: 'She had an ice cream container. She threw it at me. It hit me on the head. I was covered in flour. I said: 'What have I done to you?' 'Her friend was laughing and pointing at me. Kellie said: 'You are now white British.' I went in the house. I was upset.' Miss Bower said she called the police but had a shower and washed off the flour after being told officers would not arrive for two hours. They did not turn up until the next day and Wells was charged with racially-aggravated harassment. The court heard the mother-of-three had also threatened to burn down Miss Bower's home. She admitted racially-aggravated harassment but denied throwing flour when she appeared in court yesterday. The judge sentenced her to 33 weeks in jail and made her the subject of a restraining order for 10 years. Recorder Gordon Reed told her: 'Your behaviour was humiliating and highly offensive. In my judgement this is at the high end of the scale. Mother-of-three Wells, 42, who has 19 convictions, threw white flour over Miss Bower and told her: 'You are now white British'. Wells was jailed for 33 weeks at Maidstone Crown Court and handed a restraining order . 'Your conduct has a number of aggravating features. She was in her own home - the one place she was entitled above all else to feel comfortable and secure. 'It led to the point where she was scared to go home and she was feeling constantly stressed. She didn't feel she could go into her own garden. 'There is little evidence you show remorse. Overall, this was appalling conduct. One cannot overstate the seriousness of it. It simply cannot be tolerated.' Andrew Forsyth, prosecuting, said Wells, had 19 convictions for 27 offences, mainly for shoplifting. She failed to comply with community orders on a number of occasions and was in breach of a suspended sentence for battery involving an attack on a taxi driver. But, despite the breach, Recorder Reed decided to make the 28-day sentence concurrent instead of consecutive.","South African-born Pamela Bower was in her garden when racially abused .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A man had his £5,000 Rolex watch stolen as he lay dying in hospital while doctors desperately tried to resuscitate him. David Davies, 68, was taken by ambulance to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, during the early hours of August 7 after suffering from a serious heart condition. However, as the father was being treated in the resuscitation area next to the hospital's A&E department, his watch was stolen. David Davies, 68, was being resuscitated at St Richard's Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, in the early hours of August 7 after being admitted with a heart condition when his £5,000 Rolex watch (above) was stolen . Sussex Police said the watch was either stolen from his wrist or removed by doctors and placed with his belongings before later going missing. The force said he was wearing the watch when he was admitted to hospital and was still wearing it when he was taken down to the resuscitation room. Mr Davies died a short time later and despite a thorough search of the area, and checks with staff who were on duty at the time, his watch has not yet been found. Police have now launched an investigation into the disappearance of the family heirloom, which has devastated Mr Davies' family. Mr Davies' son John said: 'As a family we are devastated at the loss of David and cannot believe that this has happened during our time of grief. 'We would appeal to anyone who has information about the missing watch to come forward. 'David dearly loved the watch and its loss has added to the stress and grief that the family are already going through.' Detective Constable Mark Burgess urged anyone with information about the watch to come forward. He said: 'This is a silver Submariner Rolex, valued at some £5,000, but even more importantly, was treated as a family heirloom having been in the family since 1985. 'If you have any information about the theft, or if you have been offered such a watch locally since last Thursday, we would very much like to hear from you.' Mr Davies died a short time later and despite a thorough search of the area at St Richard's Hospital, West Sussex (above), and checks with staff who were on duty at the time, his watch has not yet been found . The Western Sussex Hospitals Foundation NHS Trust, which manages St Richard's Hospital, said it was doing everything it could to help with police enquiries. In a statement, the trust said: 'We would like to extend our deepest sympathy to the family at this difficult time and apologise also for the loss of this valuable item while in our care. 'The hospital is doing everything it can to help the police in their enquiries, which we hope will recover the watch as quickly as possible. 'The Trust is unable to make any further comment while the police investigation is ongoing.'

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . This is the dramatic moment a lifeboat had to come to the rescue of two cars which became swallowed up by the sea within just 90 minutes as the highest tides of the year caught drivers out. Two people were forced to climb onto the top of their vehicle's roof as it became completely submerged in the North Sea off the coast of Redcar, near Middlesbrough. At least one of the vehicles had been trying to pull a boat out of the water when it became stuck, the RNLI said. Scroll down for video . Redcar RNLI lifeboat crew was forced to come to the rescue of two vehicles which became submerged in sea water off the coast of Middlesbrough within just 90 minutes as the highest tides of the year so far hit the UK . The crew launched an inshore lifeboat to help rescue the driver and passenger of the car which was immersed . A lifeboat crew from Redcar responded to the first call-out at 3.20pm yesterday after coastguards received a number of 999 calls saying two people were on the roof of a vehicle on the town's beach as the waters came in. The station's inshore lifeboat was launched and on its arrival at the scene its crew found that the trapped people had made their own way to safety on the beach, one of them sustaining a small hand injury. To avoid the owner attempting to recover the vehicle himself in the face of the rapidly rising tide, and to avoid pollution from the vehicle's fuel tank, the lifeboat launching tractor was used to pull it clear of the water. As the crew were standing down, more calls were made to the coastguard reporting that the driver of a second vehicle had got into difficulties while trying to recover a speed boat on to its trailer near the Marine Club at South Gare. The lifeboat re-launched, but on arrival its crew discovered that the driver was safe ashore and the vehicle was being rapidly submerged by the tide. The RNLI said one vehicle had been trying to pull a boat out from the sea when it became engulfed with water . An RNLI tractor had to be used to help pull the vehicles from the water and the drivers escaped unharmed . Dave Cocks, lifeboat operations manager at Redcar RNLI, said: 'Launching and recovering boats, whether it's from the beach or a slipway, needs the right vehicle, a good understanding of what the tide is doing, and plenty of practice. 'Unfortunately it's proved a very expensive afternoon for two car owners. Fortunately, apart from a minor hand injury, no one has come to any real harm today, but the consequences could easily been much more serious. 'And with some of the highest tides of the year right now, today couldn't have been a worse day for this to happen.' The incidents occurred as the highest tides of the year so far hit across the UK due to the 'supermoon' - which occurs when a full moon or new moon has the closest approach to Earth over the year. The incidents occurred off the coast of Redcar, Middlebrough as the highest tides of the year so far hit the UK . The RNLI said the high tides were caused by a 'supermoon' which occurs when the moon comes closest to Earth. The  charity also urged members of the public to keep an eye on tidal patterns to avoid getting stranded . An RNLI spokesman added: ‘It was a super moon and that affects the tide. They are the biggest tides we’ve had so far this year. ‘If the wind was blowing the waves onto the shore it could cause a surge. ‘If people aren’t aware of the softness of the sand, they should be because it can catch them out and a car can sink very quickly. ‘People should stick to using official launching sites, on a good, solid beach.’","Two people forced to climb onto roof of car as it became submerged in water .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A baby boy whose favourite word was 'bath' drowned after being left alone at bath time when his mother became distracted by household chores. Paul Carter-Young, aged 21 months, got into difficulties at the family home in Rossendale, Lancashire, as he splashed about in the tub and popped water balloons unsupervised. His mother Kelly Young, 36, had been distracted folding clothing and sheets and talking to another of her four children in an adjoining room when the tragedy occurred in April. Paul Carter-Young (pictured) was 21-months-old when he drowned at his family home while playing with his toys and water balloons in the bath unattended as his mother folded sheets and clothes in a different room . An inquest heard how detectives investigated the incident but were content that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and that the youngster had been 'absolutely loved' by his parents . She found her son face down in the water when her youngest daughter raised the alarm. Paramedics were called to the family's £300,000 detached home but the youngster was pronounced dead on arrival at Royal Blackburn Hospital. An inquest heard how detectives investigated the incident but were content that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and the boy had been 'absolutely loved'. They concluded Miss Young and her company director partner Paul Carter, 54, led a 'quite a hectic' family life with four children and were 'beside themselves' over their son's death. The toddler had been nicknamed 'Dragon' by the family because he was born in the Chinese year of the mythological creature and loved baths and water. The hearing was told he had been born weighing 5lbs 3oz and with a cleft lip but had surgery at three months old and smiled a week later. He had two sisters, Imogen, 14, and Amelia, and an older brother. The youngster was found face down in the bath at the family's £300,000 family home (above) in Rossendale, Lancashire, on April 10. He was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival . In a statement Miss Young, who was excused from attending the Burnley hearing, said: 'He never cried, he was so strong. Imogen did everything for him. He would whinge and she would tell me what he wanted.' She added that his favourite word was 'bath' and that he would like to pop water balloons while being washed. The inquest heard how the tragedy occurred on April 10 when Miss Young ran a bath for her two youngest children - the toddler and his sister Amelia. Young Paul sat in the bath with his toys and jugs but Amelia had not wanted to get in. Miss Young added: 'We have always had a busy, noisy house. He would love the bath. Dragon always had to be put in the water with jugs and toys. I went to get Amelia, I didn't know why she didn't want to get in. I went to the landing.' She added that she went to look in the bathroom and heard the balloons popping before going to her bedroom and talked to eldest daughter Imogen. She began folding up clothes while shouting for Amelia to get into the bath. Still hearing balloons popping, the inquest heard that Miss Young's other daughter then came in and began talking to her. The young boy was nicknamed 'Dragon' by his family because he was born in the Chinese year of the mythological creature and loved baths and water . She then said she heard Amelia say: 'Mummy Dragon'. In her statement Miss Young added: 'I ran to the bathroom, everything happened very quickly. Dragon was face down in the bath. I scooped him up and held him in my arms, patting his body. I told Imogen to take Amelia away and shouted for Paul to come up.' The youngster was put in the recovery position and his parents attempted resuscitation causing the boy to be sick. Miss Young then ran to a neighbour who was a trainee nurse and banged on the window before returning to the house. The statement read that Miss Young was unable to go up the stairs adding, 'I can't do when my kids get hurt, I just want to run away.' She added that when she saw paramedics carrying him down the stairs she thought he was going to be okay before her partner called her from the hospital to tell her the news. She added that she took the youngster's dragon pyjamas to the hospital and told him: 'I'm sorry'. Pathologist Naomi Carter was unable to say how long the boy had been under the water. In a statement read out at the inquest, Dr Carter said: 'Death is consistent with having drowned. It is not assessable to say how long he was under the water. Bubble bath and large toys may have put him at an increase of slipping.' Detective constable Leanne Lyons, of Lancashire Police, said Miss Young had been 'beside herself ' and had 'thought he would be okay'. She told the inquest that the couple had been left devastated. She said: 'They were blaming themselves, a very natural thing to do. They were distressed, blaming themselves and then supporting each other. 'They had quite a hectic family life. From the offset there was no inconsistency. They understood why I was there. Like in most households bath time can quite easily get out of hand. 'I was quite happy with the explanation that was given at the time. Both the mother and father were clearly devastated. She talked quite openly about how Dragon loved water whereas she had a fear of water and was wary of it.' East Lancashire coroner Richard Taylor said he understood why Miss Young hadn't wanted to attend the inquest and returned a conclusion of accidental death.","Paul Carter-Young was 21-months-old when he drowned at the family home .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A veteran Labour MP has launched a withering attack on the party’s leadership for failing to connect with voters. Former actress Glenda Jackson, 78, said Labour had gone too long without outlining any policies and was still struggling to get through to the public. She said: ‘For far too long, we didn't have a policy to bless ourselves with and we still have this inherent problem that we do have policies but still aren't selling them strongly enough. It’s not playing out there.’ She added: ‘You do wonder who’s advising him [Miliband], sometimes.’ Glenda Jackson sparked controversy after attacking Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons during a special session to honour the former Prime Minister . Glenda Jackson (right) has hit out at Labour's failure to win over voters with new policies . When asked about Mr Miliband’s vision of a ‘one-nation’ Britain, in an interview for the New Statesman magazine, she said: ‘I don’t like visionaries. I was taught the only path a leader will take is up the garden path.’ Ms Jackson, a double Oscar winning actress who famously appeared on Morcambe and Wise as Cleopatra, also hit out at the sexism in Parliament. She said when she spoke up after a male MP had ignored a female colleague it was like ‘as though we had attempted some kind of castration’. Ms Jackson said when she was first elected to the Commons in 1992 she was treated as either an ‘airhead’ or a ‘diva’. She said: I was treated either as an airhead who would fall flat on her face or as some unconscionably egotistical diva who would demand treatment different to everybody else. 'Neither of those assessments bears any relation to me whatsoever.’ Ms Jackson, who has been a Labour MP since 1992, won the Oscar for best actress in 1969 and 1972. She famously appeared on Morcambe and Wise at the height of her fame in the 1970s . Ms Jackson is standing down next year after more than 20 years in the Commons as the MP for Hampstead. She said: ‘I shall be almost 80.. You need somebody younger. This country is in danger of being governed by pensioners like me. I don’t think that’s the best way forward.’","Former actress says Labour went too long without offering any policies .

"By . James Slack for the Daily Mail . Foreign criminals have been rounded up from Britain’s ‘soft’ open jails and put back behind bars to stop them absconding. Over the past 48 hours, more than 20 offenders were moved back to closed conditions. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now imposed a ban on foreign convicts who are subject to deportation orders being placed in open jail. More than 20 offenders were moved from open jails and back to closed conditions to stop them absconding . They will also be barred from taking part in Release on Temporary Licence, whereby inmates can leave a jail in the daytime to find work or undergo rehabilitation because a string of prisoners have failed to return. The move will affect hundreds of foreign prisoners. There are some 800 awaiting deportation. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: ‘We are working hard to return foreign national prisoners to their own countries to serve their sentences. While they remain with us, we must do all we can to make sure they stay safely under lock and key. ‘That’s why I am changing the rules to prevent those foreign nationals who are going to be deported from being transferred into open prisons or getting temporary release. ‘It’s clearly not right that foreign nationals who are going to be deported end up in open prisons where they might abscond and threaten public safety.’ Figures published last month showed a sharp rise in the number of inmates going missing from jail – in the past year there were 225, up almost 30 per cent over the past two years. This included 137 from open prisons, which have been the subject of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out. The most high-profile was Michael Wheatley, known as the ‘Skullcracker’, who sparked a nationwide hunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (pictured) has imposed ban on foreign convicts subject to deportation orders . Officials say the number of foreign criminals who have walked out is around 10 over the past five years. It comes amid renewed controversy over the Government’s record. On Monday, the Mail revealed how the number of overseas inmates escaping deportation rocketed by 50 per cent last year. In total, only 1,310 of the 4,030 overseas convicts considered for removal were sent home. The offenders who were not thrown out last year included 15 murderers, five people guilty of manslaughter, 15 rapists, 140 robbers and 20 people guilty of sex offences against children. The foreign convicts are now avoiding deportation in one in every three cases – a sharp increase on previous years.","More than 20 offenders have been moved from open jails to closed prisons .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Former Manchester United defender Gary Neville believes Wayne Rooney has all the attributes to be a successful Red Devils captain. New United boss Louis van Gaal earlier this week confirmed Rooney as his skipper following Nemanja Vidic's departure to Inter Milan and Neville believes the decision is a wise one. Neville, who played for 602 times for United, said: 'There has been a sharp decline in leadership in football but Rooney has all the attributes. Captain: Wayne Rooney has been handed the armband by Louis van Gaal and Gary Neville is backing him . Leader: Rooney can hold his team-mates to account, according to Neville - and that makes him a good leader . 'By 'leaders' I mean people who are prepared not only to hold themselves accountable but hold their team-mates accountable too,' Neville said in his Daily Telegraph column. 'Rooney is one of a dying breed of footballers who is willing to call his team-mates out. He can take criticism but also hand it out. His approach is the traditional one of not taking criticism personally - and expecting team-mates not to take it personally either. 'Van Gaal will have looked at Rooney and thought: this is a player who is not too proud to listen to criticism and not too shy to dish it out. That is captaincy material, as Van Gaal outlined in his press conference ahead of the Swansea match. The next stage for Rooney is to think like a captain. 'When I think back to his early days at United I remember his personality and cheekiness. Rooney was the only player who would dare pull up a seat at the coaches' table in the canteen and ask Sir Alex Ferguson: ""Am I playing tomorrow, boss?"" The manager would cuff him about the head and say: ""That's nothing to do with you.""' Dressing room influence: Rooney is ready to take up the tough task of skippering the Reds . Rooney, meanwhile, has described being handed the United captaincy as an honour. 'It's a massive role to take on - I'm aware of that, the responsibility of it - and I feel I'm ready at this stage in my career to do it,"" the 28-year-old forward told United Uncovered.

Fans of the Wuthering Heights singer want her to remove the sex offender’s contribution to three songs from any rereleases. Bush’s musical partnership with Harris began in 1982 when she asked him to play the didgeridoo on the title track of her 1982 album Dreaming. Pop star Kate Bush (left) is under pressure to expunge paedophile Rolf Harris (right) from her albums . The pair became friends and collaborated again on the chart-topping 2005 album Aerial when Harris performed the spoken role of the painter on the two tracks ‘An Architects Dream’ and ‘The Painter’s Link’. But fans say they can no longer bear to listen to the tracks after Harris, 84, was found guilty of 12 sexual assaults against victims aged between eight and nineteen between 1969 and 1986. They are now urging the Babooshka singer to ensure his contribution is kept off the albums if they are remastered or reissued. One tweeted: “I feel they (the songs) have now been soiled, and I would like the chance to listen to these tracks without the input of Rolf Harris. “Maybe Kate will do this in future, she has been an avid supporter of childrens’ charities here in the UK (NSPCC springs to mind) so she may want to do this.” Another added: “Rolf Harris made a significant contribution to The Painter’s Link and every time that track officially down loaded, Kate (via her companies) profits from it. That has to a very unwelcome association for Kate. Although she clearly wasn’t aware of Rolf’s criminal activity at the time the recording was made, she must be well aware of it now.” Another fan simply said they would like to listen to Aerial ‘without having to spend time with a sex offender.’ Bush who will next month perform her first live concerts in 35 years was reportedly shocked when she heard that Harris had been sentenced to five years and nine months in prison for the attacks. The star, 55, is believed to be planning to perform ‘An Architect’s Dream and The Painter’s Link when she takes to the stage for 22 nights at the Hammersmith Apollo. Fans are also wanting assurances that the singer’s record label will not release a vision of the song She Moves Through the Fair which she is believed to have recorded with Harris.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Lord Justice Fulford has been cleared of any allegations of misconduct by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office . A top judge who founded a campaign group which helped leaders of the Paedophile Information Exchange in 1979 has been exonerated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office. An investigation was launched in March when The Mail on Sunday revealed Appeal Court Judge and Privy Counsellor Lord Justice Fulford, at the time a young barrister, set up an organisation called Conspiracy Against Public Morals. The group campaigned against conspiracy charges faced by PIE leaders. But Lord Justice Fulford has now been cleared of any allegations of misconduct. The judge sparked anger earlier this year by slashing the prison sentence of a primary school deputy who hoarded films of the sadistic abuse of young children. Stephen Horn, 34, admitted viewing child pornography over 13 years and downloading 20 hours of sickening footage. He was jailed for 18 months in December and banned from having unsupervised contact with any child under 16. Horn appealed the severity of his jail term which was reduced to ten months by three High Court judges including Justice Fulford. The senior judge and two colleagues ruled that Horn had not breached his trust as a teacher because his crimes did not involve his pupils. They also said the Sexual Offences Prevention Order which banned him from unsupervised contact with children was unfair. The judges also quashed the £100 victim surcharge and said it had been unlawfully imposed because some of Horn’s crimes happened before it came into force. In their judgement Judge Fulford and his two colleagues ruled: 'None of the offences involved a breach of trust as a teacher.'","Top judge who founded a campaign group which helped leaders of Paedophile Information Exchange exonerated by investigation .

The maca plant has long been eaten for its purported health benefits. Maca extract was  fed to mice over six weeks and those given the highest dose were found to exhibit the least depressed behaviour. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol decreased while levels of the happy hormone dopamine rose, according to research at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China. Maca, which is available from health food stores, has previously been credited with boosting energy and libido, and clearing up acne. Fans include supermodel Miranda Kerr, who mixes the powder into smoothies. A liquid probiotic supplement has been shown to be effective for sufferers of  Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Symprove – a barley-based drink that delivers four strains of helpful bacteria to the gut – significantly improved pain in patients who had not responded to conventional treatments, according to a study. IBS affects one in five people and causes abdominal pain, bloating, constipation and diarrhoea. There is no cure. The supplement, costing £79 for about four weeks’ supply, relieved symptoms in 60 per cent of patients within 12 weeks, with no unpleasant side effects. ‘This is a real breakthrough,’ said Professor Ingvar Bjarnason, consultant gastroenterologist  at Kings College Hospital and principal investigator of the study published in the Journal Of Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics. ‘Symprove had a profound impact, and for the first time we saw people becoming symptom-free.’ Root of all cheerful: Extract from the South American maca plant has been found to work as an anti-depressant has previously been credited with boosting energy and libido, and clearing up acne . PEOPLE who live on a noisy road have higher blood pressure than those in  quiet backstreets. Each ten-decibel increase in sound is linked to an 11 per cent rise in the risk of high blood pressure, a new study found. And high noise levels in the living room during the day increased the risk of hypertension by 24 per cent. The German Federal Environment Agency investigated the health of nearly 2,000 people. ‘Chronic exposure to traffic noise is associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure,’ said Dr Wolfgang Babisch, who led the study. The reason is unclear, but one theory is that noise has a stress-like effect that releases hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Digging for fitness: Victoria has found gardening tones her arms .

Called Steri-Spray, it uses ultraviolet light  to destroy legionella bacteria that can lurk in shower heads and taps and cause a pneumonia-type lung infection if inhaled. It also purges incoming water of bacteria. Water treatment specialist Ian Helmore came up with the idea after finding a positive legionella sample on a shower during testing at a hospital. It led to all showers being shut for two weeks. His solution is backed by Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis, and Steri-Spray products are now used in 26 of the UK’s 50 NHS trusts.

William Ferridge never found the time to request them when he finished military service in 1946. But 68 years later, close friends applied on his behalf, and he was awarded them at a special ceremony last week. Second World War veteran William Ferridge has finally received his war medals at the age of 91 . Mr Ferridge, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, was a lance corporal with the Royal Corps of Signals and provided battle communications during the war. His medals included the Italy Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal and the War Medal. Speaking at the ceremony in Havant, near Portsmouth, he said: ‘I had just been married when I left the service and had to get a job and earn a living. 'I never got round to applying for my medals – life got in the way. So, this was a big surprise, but a very nice one.’ The presentation comes just weeks after world leaders gathered in Normandy to mark the 70th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 1944. Close friends applied for the medals on his behalf, and he was awarded them at a special ceremony in Hampshire last week . Veterans saluted on the beaches at dawn and downed Calvados at 6.30am - the moment the landings started. During the poignant event, the Queen met veterans and saluted the 'immense and heroic' endeavour of them and their comrades 70 years ago. Barack Obama spoke at a U.S. war cemetery and told how 150,000 fought at time of 'maximum peril for the world'. For many veterans, now in their 80s and 90s, it may have been their annual pilgrimage to honour fallen troops.","William Ferridge was Second World War lance corporal with Royal Corps of Signals .

Busy Sarah-Jane, 29, has had no time to visit a personal trainer since being hired by Simon Cowell to host The X Factor’s sister show, so she’s using a web-based course from BodyBuilding.com. She hopes to shed fat and develop lean arms and a six-pack, and tone her leg muscles in preparation for what will be her first TV role.

New research shows that those in a stable relationship were nearly 60 per cent less likely to suffer with erectile dysfunction. In a study of 1,000 men, doctors  at Turku University Hospital in Finland quizzed them about rates of impotence, lifestyle and other  factors, and carried out a number of laboratory tests. Results showed that 57 to 68 per cent of the men had problems maintaining an erection. Smokers were at highest risk, with  41 per cent having problems. Men in a stable relationship had a 57 per cent lower risk, and those who took part in high-intensity physical activity had a 50 per cent reduced risk. Just how being in a stable relationship could have such an effect is not clear. It has been suggested that marriage may provide an emotionally fulfilling, intimate relationship, which has an impact on physical and mental health. Eating for two: Many new mothers have been found to have as much as 50lb during their pregnancy, when just a  25 to 35lb pound weight gain is believed to be necessary (stock image) Despite government health warnings, pregnant women still gain twice the recommended amount of weight  during pregnancy – largely because many still believe the myth of ‘eating  for two’ and that exercise may be damaging to the unborn child. Researchers, who interviewed expectant mothers, found many  gained as much as 50lb when just a  25 to 35lb pound weight gain is believed to be necessary. Gestational weight gain can cause health problems for the mother and child and is thought to be a contributor to the rise in childhood obesity rates. Dr Jennifer Kraschnewski, of Penn State College of Medicine in the US, who led the study said: ‘Excessive weight gain is a direct, although misguided, result of women’s concern to support a healthy pregnancy. ‘Pregnant women are focused on making sure they are eating enough, which is often too much, and avoiding exercise to protect the foetus.’","Xtra Factor presenter keeps fit by using online training .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . and Leon Watson . Former Asian Football Confederation President Mohammed Bin Hammam is alleged to have paid out £3 million in bribes to football officials to secure support for the 2022 Qatar world cup bid . Leading MPs have called on Fifa to strip Qatar of the 2022 World Cup after it emerged illicit payments of £3 million were made to corrupt officials. John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said: 'There is now an overwhelming case that the decision to where the World Cup should be held in 2022 should be run again.' Conservative MP Damian Collins, who submitted a private member’s bill to Parliament last month that would fight corruption in football, also called for the process to be re-run. A damning email dossier shows how Mohamed Bin Hammam former president of the Asian Football Confederation used the slush fund to garner support for Qatar's bid to host the tournament. The Sunday Times reports that the . bribes helped sway key members of FIFA’s 24-man ruling committee into . giving the green light for the Arab emirate to host the tournament, . despite its lack of football infrastructure. It . is alleged that delegates who decided upon the destination of the 2022 . competition were treated to lavish junkets and large cash payments to . secure their support. The . secret dossier provides evidence of £3 million in cash payments to . football officials across the globe in order to secure support for the . Qatari bid. When the decision was announced, there was shock as the Gulf state has no tradition of football or any suitable stadiums. Also, concerns were raised that with temperatures exceeding 50c, it would be dangerous for both players and supporters. During one . session in 2008, Bin Hammam is believed to have handed over $200,000 . in cash to 25 delegates who had been flown to Kuala Lumpur to discuss . the bid. It is alleged that African football officials received cash payments up to $80,000 from accounts controlled by Bin Hammam. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, right, awarded the competition to Gulf state following a vote in December 2010 . The disclosures come less than two weeks before Brazil is set to host the World Cup and will heap pressure on the tiny desert state. One official sought $232,000 to be paid into his personal bank account which he said would be used to develop football pitches. Bin Hammam was banned from world football 2011 after he was discovered bribing officials during his bid to get elected Fifa president. Fifa is now under pressure to re-examine the Qatari bid as a result of the latest corruption allegations . The Qatari World Cup committee now face an investigation by Fifa's ethics investigator Michael Garcia. The New York lawyer is due to fly out to the middle east next week to investigate the controversial competition bid. Among the shocking allegations, The Sunday Times alleges that former Caribbean football chief Jack Warner was paid $450,000 before the 2010 bid. Qatar, which holds the world’s third-largest natural-gas reserves, plans to spend more than $200 billion on new infrastructure before hosting the sporting event. This is expected to include $34 billion on a rail and metro system, $7 billion on a port and $17 billion on an airport. The stadiums will cost $4 billion, according to the ministry of business and trade. However, the Middle Eastern state of two million people is facing delays and escalating costs related to the event. Work started later than planned on the metro system, and the opening of the new airport is six years behind schedule. It originally announced plans for 12 stadiums, including nine new playing fields and three refurbishments, but that has bee cut to eight. Fifa decided to announce the winners of . the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids on the same day in 2010, when they . awarded the competition to Russia and then Qatar. England had run a campaign to host the competition in 2018, but were humiliated when they received only two votes. Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William played a central role to the failed English bid. Only last month, FIFA president Sepp Blatter admitted it had been a ‘mistake’ to hand the tournament to Qatar after technical assessors had said the searing temperatures could be harmful to players. The revelations emerged as it was reported that police were probing World Cup match-fixing involving Nigeria. A football agent was secretly filmed claiming that Nigerian footballers were willing to rig ties in Brazil for cash, saying: 'I know the games, I know the system.' Members of the Qatar delegation denied that Bin Hammam had any role in their successful bid, while members of his family refused to comment on the issue. FIFA's former president of the World Cup organising committee Jack Warner has been at the centre of corruption allegations . The awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was one of the most controversial decisions in sporting history. Even before . the decision was made, there were persistent allegations of corruption. Six weeks before the vote in Zurich, a World Cup official was caught in . an undercover investigation agreeing to sell his vote to one of . England’s rivals. A . second member of the same committee was recorded asking for . £1.5 million for a sports academy. Both officials were suspended, . meaning that 22 people voted instead of the usual 24. A . whistleblower also claimed that one of the bidders had bought the votes . of three African executive committee members. The former Fifa employee . later withdrew the allegations. Following . England’s defeat, a parliamentary committee held an inquiry into the . failed bid. Lord Triesman, the bid’s former chairman, gave evidence . stating that four Fifa executive committee members had asked for . business deals and favours when negotiating their support. One of those . he named was former vice-president of Fifa Jack Warner. Last month it was alleged Mr Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million (£1.2m) from a Qatari firm linked to the country’s successful bid. The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Warner appeared to have been personally paid $1.2 million (£720,000) from a company controlled by a former Qatari football official shortly after the decision to award the country the tournament. Payments totalling almost $750,000 (£450,000) were made to Mr Warner's sons, documents show. A further $400,000 (£240,000) was paid to one of his employees. It is understood that the FBI is now investigating Trinidad-based Mr Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid, and that the former Fifa official’s eldest son, who lives in Miami, has been helping the inquiry as a co-operating witness. The question of the heat during a summer tournament has also been a one of the controversies raised since Qatar was announced as the winner of the bid in December 2010. Players' union FIFPro has said it will urge its members not to take part if it is played in Qatar's summer, even if air conditioning is installed in the stadiums. Qatar's building projects have also been hit by allegations of migrant construction workers not being given enough food or water, as well as accusations of corruption over the voting procedure to win the bid. Officials have denied the accusations. Overall, the tiny gas-rich state plans to spend about $140 billion on a rail system, a new airport, a seaport, and hundreds of kilometers of new roads for the tournament, in addition to the stadiums that will host the matches. Soul diva Diana Ross entertains the crowd during the opening ceremony for the 1994 World Cup at the Soldier Field stadium in Chicago . The U.S. (2022 bidder) America, which was an initial bidder for 2022, would undoubtedly be popular with travelling fans and it already has the stadia in place. However, the U.S. hosted the cup relatively recently, in 1994, when Diana Ross famously missed an open . goal at the opening ceremony. Australia (2022 bidder) Australasia . has never hosted a World Cup, so . taking the finals there would allow Fifa to say it has taken the game to another continent. Australia, also beaten by Qatar for 2022, put on a spectacular success when it hosted the 2000 Sydney Olympics. However, players and fans would face similar problems with heat as in Qatar if the competition is held there. South Korea (2022 bidder) Twenty years after . jointly hosting Asia's first World Cup, South Korea wanted to do it . again. Along with Japan, Korea was a worthy destination in 2002, but, . like with the USA, the recentness would probably work against them. Japan (2022 bidder) Similarly . to South Korea, Japan's joint host venture in 2002 is unlikely to aid . them, although Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympics. England (2018 bidder) England, a 2018 World Cup bidder, have not hosted a . World Cup since 1966, although it did showcase the European Championship in 1996. It boasts top-class stadia and held the London 2012 Olympics to enormous success. Tensions between the FA and Fifa could be a problem though. Spain and Portugal (2018 bidder) Spain . hosted the World Cup in 1982 and Portugal delivered a vibrant Euro . 2004. Both countries, who bid for the 2018 competition, boast excellent stadia and a genuine footballing . history. Holland and Belgium (2018 bidder) The two lowland countries launched a joint bid to host the 2018 World Cup. The pair hosted Euro 2000, but the tournament was marred by hooliganism and that would count against them. The stadia Belgium offered was also criticised.","Damning dossier exposes alleged corruption during 2022 World Cup bid .

In the first three months of the year 11 Skye puppies were registered with the Kennel Club,  compared with one in the same period last year. But there are now little more than 3,000 of the breed in the world and fewer than 400 in Britain. Top dog: The classic Skye terrier - one of 11 registered with the Kennel Club in this year's first three months . Inspiration: It is believed Skye terriers were the inspiration for Dougal (centre) in The Magic Roundabout . Experts claim about 300 a year need to be born to save the breed from extinction. Meanwhile the total number of wild pandas is 4,000 worldwide. Skye terrier lovers believe children’s TV character Dougal in the The Magic Roundabout was a drop-eared example of the pet. The dog’s revival is being credited to the triumph at Crufts last year of Lampard, a prick-eared specimen which appeared in the Best In Show final seven. Lampard’s owner Sue Breeze, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, said: ‘The latest figures from the Kennel Club show we are succeeding in making the breed more popular.’ Under threat: The Kennel Club hopes the Skye terrier's rise in popularity will encourage dog lovers to take an interest in other endangered native breeds such as the Cardigan Welsh corgi . English Setters are also endangered, the Club warned, with fewer than 300 registered in Britain . She hoped more people would consider a Skye terrier as a pet. She said: ‘A puppy costs about £650 and when you think people are paying over £1,000 for designer dogs they are reasonably priced.’ The Skye terrier is one of the oldest native breeds, dating to the 14th Century. It is generally accepted the breed originated with a local terrier mating with dogs which survived the sinking of a man-of-war from the Spanish Armada. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier, written about by Sir Walter Scott, is now one of the nation's rarest dogs . The best-known Skye terrier is Greyfriars Bobby, famous in 19th Century Edinburgh for supposedly spending 14 years guarding the grave of his police constable master, John Gray. Mary Queen of Scots is reputed  to have hidden one under her skirt when she was beheaded. The Kennel Club is delighted with the terrier’s rise in popularity and hopes it will encourage dog lovers to take an interest in other endangered native breeds such as the Cardigan Welsh corgi, the Dandie Dinmont terrier and the English setter.

Mr Farnell also denies Ms Chanbua's claims that they neglected Gammy and gave favourable treatment to Pipah. 'We bought milk for both babies, we bought nappies for both babies,' Mr Farnell says. Mr and Mrs Farnell have spoken to 60 Minutes about the surrogacy scandal engulfing them, and are expected to detail the events surrounding the birth of their twins via a surrogate mother in Thailand earlier this year. Both have come under intense media scrutiny since the scandal broke, and will reveal how they have been hiding inside their Western Australia home all week while reporters camped on their door step. David and Wendy Farnell did not shower or turn on the computer to ensure no one found out that they were hidden inside. They remained undetected on the two occasions child protection officers came to the Bunbury home to speak with the parents, news.com.au reports. The couple have been sought by the Western Australian Department of Child Protection, who wish to assess the Farnells suitability as parents since it was revealed that David Farnell, 56, is a convicted paedophile. The Farnells also refused to come to the door when the RSPCA took the family dog away, believing the couple had left their home and abandoned their pet. The couple say they fed their dog everyday before it was taken away on Tuesday. It is understood the Farnells have contacted the department this week. The Australian parents of baby Gammy left their home at midnight on Wednesday. On Thursday night, they filmed an interview with 60 minutes, pleading with Australians to 'hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them'. 60 Minutes will make a donation to the charity Hands Across The Water, but the couple were not paid for the interview. David and Wendy Farnell, the parents at the centre of the surrogacy scandal, will speak for the first time about the events surrounding the birth of their twins . The couple spoke to 60 Minutes in a revealing interview on Sunday evening, as they told 'their side of the story' Hands Across The Water have already raised more than $200,000 for Gammy's treatment and care. They will support Gammy until he has completed his education. David and Wendy Farnell, who are at the centre of the surrogacy scandal that has gripped the country, will speak to 60 Minutes this Sunday about the events surrounding the birth of their twins via a surrogate mother in Thailand earlier this year. A preview of episode shows Mr Farnell explaining, 'We wanted to bring him with us.' In the late 1990s, Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, committed while he was in his 20s, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'. Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10. It was not until the women were adults that they made complaints and court documents said the women had suffered 'depression' and 'difficulty forming relationships' as a result of the abuse. But the couple, who will be interviewed on 60 Minutes on Sunday, spoke through the television program to ask 'Australia to hear their side of the story before passing judgment on them.' Meanwhile Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, declined to give an interview with the program, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 'I don't want money from them,' she said. 'I don't need their help.' David Farnell, 56, was convicted of 22 counts of child sex offences in the late 1990s . The couple's interview will come just days after one of Mr Farnell's adult children – a son from his previous marriage – spoke out in defence of his father, saying that the family had not been able to tell their side of the story for legal reasons. Also on Thursday, the son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that it was 'heartbreaking' his father's dark past was being revisited. 'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son was quoted as saying. Ms Pattaramon claims the Farnells, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister. The Farnells initially claimed their daughter, whom they admitted was the same age as Gammy and had been born through a Thai surrogate, did not have a twin brother. They later said they had known about the twin, but were told he only had a day to live and should say their goodbyes to the baby before they left the country, due to civil unrest. Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, says the Farnells did not want Gammy and told her to have an abortion, when they discovered he had Down syndrome . Chanbua smothered him with kisses while he was in hospital getting treatment for a lung infection . The couple also wanted to make it known that they have been cooperating with the Department of Child Protection since Wednesday morning and will continue to cooperate with them. They also wanted it to be known that they had been feeding their dog every day until the RSPCA took her away on Wednesday morning. Officers from the Department of Child Protection were seen visiting the Farnells' South Bunbury home on Wednesday. The Farnells wanted to make it known that they had been cooperating with the DoCP since that time .

"By . Martin Samuel . Daniel Sturridge looked straight out at his audience. Straight in the eye. He measured his words, slowly, to add emphasis. He pronounced every last syllable. ‘I’ll be truthful,’ he said. ‘I am going to do anything in my power to win this next game. I am prepared to do anything and I am talking anything. ‘I’m being serious. It is do or die. It’s a World Cup. I’m hungry, I’m confident and I’m so happy to be out here. VIDEO Scroll down to watch All Star XI: Luis Suarez . Focused: England striker Daniel Sturridge has vowed to do whatever it takes to beat Uruguay . Man on a mission: Sturridge poses following England's training session in Rio de Janeiro on Monday . Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck pose after the England training session . VIDEO All Star XI: Luis Suarez . ‘This means everything to every single individual in this squad. Do I want to go home early? No. I want to win this World Cup like everyone back home wants us to win it and I’d be gutted to go out in the group. ‘It means the world to me to play for England and I’d be devastated if that happened. So, yes, anything. And I’m being totally honest with you guys.’ As the question had concerned Gus Poyet’s assertion that Uruguay would use any means necessary to win a World Cup game - and he produced quite an exhaustive list of dark arts as evidence - it was amusing to watch the colour drain from the faces of the Football Association as Sturridge spoke. Dr Steve Peters and the FA’s media squad are working so hard to control the inner chimps out here and then Sturridge goes and fills the room with talk of monkey business. He clarified, of course. He wouldn’t cheat, he said. Wouldn’t dive, wouldn’t punch the ball off the line to deny a Uruguayan winner - not that he will often be in that position, to be fair - would only act within the laws of the game. VIDEO Sturridge has bigger worries than Suarez . Cool finish: Sturridge connects with Wayne Rooney's cross to pull England level against Italy on Saturday night . Reaching for the stars: Sturridge points to the sky following his strike during England's defeat to Italy . Roar talent: Sturridge, congratulated by Jordan Henderson, lets it all out after scoring for England . Yet, deep down, those in the room knew what he meant. Michael Owen said he didn’t cheat in 1998, either. He just didn’t struggle manfully to stay on his feet when he thought a tumbling alternative might win the game. Suffice to say, if Sturridge had received the same penalty area contact as Steven Gerrard in  Manaus on Saturday, maybe England would be reflecting on a  2-2 draw with Italy. ‘We’re an honest country,’ he said. ‘We go about our business in an honest way. No disrespect to other countries, I’m sure they are honest, too. ‘But we play within the laws of the game. We don’t bend the rules. We play by the book. There’s nothing wrong with that. We’ve gone a long way doing it, from 1966 when we won the World Cup. We played within the laws and that’s how I was brought up, how everyone in our squad was brought up. Tumble: Michael Owen goes to ground under the challenge of Roberto Ayala during France '98 . Daniel Sturridge has scored three goals in his last four England games - against Italy, Peru and Denmark. He averages 0.63 goals per game in an England shirt. ‘We don’t like to cheat to win. We want to play in an honest way. That’s how I feel football should be played. ‘I will stay on my feet. I will never dive on purpose to get some guy sent off. I’m not going to handle a goal to stop the ball going in the net because it’s not in my nature. So not diving, but I will do anything  - just like every single one of my team-mates - as Uruguay will, too. They’re hungry, just like us. And we’ll work our socks off, do more than we’ve ever done before.’ Up at Uruguay’s training base in Sete Lagoas near Belo Horizonte, Luis Suarez - a man who might not have added those calming qualifications at the end of such a speech - was declaring himself 100 per cent fit to face England. He can’t be, of course. If he was 100 per cent on Monday, he would have been around 80 per cent at the weekend and would surely have been introduced by Uruguay’s coach Oscar Taberez when the second Costa Rican goal went in. Never mind. Neither side is going to offer psychological advantage or  candid insights into team selection at this stage and, despite protestations to the contrary, England’s players were definitely guided not to make this match all about one man. Sidelined: Suarez watched on from the bench during Uruguay's shock 3-1 defeat to Costa Rica on Saturday . Sturridge met any direct question about his Liverpool team-mate with a vague, generic reply praising the entire Uruguayan team. So ask Suarez, get Diego Forlan, Edinson Cavani or a bland overview of a starting XI that to most eyes appears less than the sum of one part. Most definitely, there is a risk of thinking that any single man is a team. Yet with Uruguay it is an  undeniable truth that, like  Portugal, an individual has dragged them to this World Cup. Uruguay sneaked in as the final South American qualifiers, via a play-off win against Jordan. Without Suarez, however, they were undone by Costa Rica and in the second half their physically imposing yet clunky defence looked every day of its advancing age. Talisman: Suarez does some stretching during a Uruguay training session on Sunday in Sete Lagoas . England will hope to exploit those same weaknesses in Sao Paulo on Thursday while playing down the fear that Suarez is planning to do the same to them, on the evidence of the 2-1 defeat by Italy. Asked what he will be telling  England’s defenders about his club partner, Sturridge offered that he was unpredictable, a tip as helpful as the knowledge that he will be wearing light blue. Still, there is an element of honesty about it at least. What is the defence mechanism against a player with Suarez’s mesmerising talent? As Bosnia-Herzegovina found against Lionel Messi on Sunday night, the true greats defy containment. For 65 minutes, they gave the little master barely a kick. And then he won the day for Argentina. ‘I think these days there is a lot of unpredictability in the best players’ games,’ said Sturridge. ‘Luis,  Neymar, Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo. You can’t tell players what to do against those guys. ‘Show Arjen Robben down the line and he’ ll go another way, show Robben on his left foot and he’ll go on his right. Star man: Lionel Messi won the day for Argentina as he scored the match-winner against Bosnia . ‘The best are unpredictable and Luis is unpredictable. So it’s not for us to worry just about Luis. We’re the players that are up against him most, the English defenders. We know him better than anyone else at the World Cup. ‘Sure, he’s a world-class player, but we’re facing Uruguay, with  Cavani and Forlan, who is a legend in Uruguay and has done really well in Europe. There are other players who are technically very gifted. ‘Would I want Luis to be injured? Would I want to play against him? It doesn’t really matter. If Luis is fit, good luck to him. If not, there’ll be another hungry player doing his best. We’re worrying about Uruguay as a team, not just him. ‘If they had won their last game against Costa Rica there wouldn’t have been such an obsession about him being fit. If they had won, people would have thought: “Oh, they’re OK without Luis”. ‘Because they lost, people think no Luis is the reason behind it all. But it’s just speculation. He could have played and they might still have lost. ‘Look, we’re playing Uruguay. I don’t think they will be saying to watch out for Daniel Sturridge or Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard. We spoke a lot about Andrea Pirlo before the first game, but it still needed Claudio Marchisio to hit the ball in from all of 25 yards for their goal.’","Daniel Sturridge vows to do whatever it takes to defeat Uruguay .

"By . Martin Samuel . It was rather fitting that the first coach to use the World Cup drinks break to dramatic effect was  Louis van Gaal of Holland. Van . Gaal is what is known as a game-changer. That is the role Manchester . United have set out for him, as the successor to the forlorn David . Moyes. They want the new coach to arrest last season's decline, to . rebuild  Sir Alex Ferguson's team and restore the club to the pinnacle . of English football. Yet Van Gaal is a game-changer in a . literal sense, too. He intervenes, he inspires, he diverts the course of . the matches his teams play. VIDEO Scroll down to watch fiery Van Gaal lose his temper during Holland training . The comeback kings: Louis van Gaal celebrates as Holland beat Mexico late on to progress to the last eight . Not his day: Robin van Persie's performance mirrored one of his poor displays for United last season . VIDEO Dutch party rumbles on . He is a 12th man, a non-playing substitute, whose intrusions into the action are, if not always a guarantee of success, then certainly worthwhile. There is a lazy presumption in the English game that once the team enter the field there is little the manager can do about proceedings. Van Gaal challenges that. He certainly did in Fortaleza on Sunday. In searing heat, the most hostile conditions of the World Cup so far, he used the opportunity of a second-half drinks break to alter Holland's shape against Mexico. He took off Robin van Persie and replaced him with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar; he moved Dirk Kuyt from left wing back to a supporting striker role; he went long on his route to goal. The Van Persie decision was brave. This is, after all, his captain and the player who it is said will smooth his path at Manchester United next summer. Van Gaal needs Van Persie to help sell his often-confrontational style and methods to the rest of the dressing room. Yet it was the direct approach in moving the ball forward that was his greatest risk. Already derided by the grandees of Dutch football, including Johan Cruyff, had Van Gaal played in a less sophisticated way in the final minutes against Mexico and lost, he would have been decried as a philistine. Instead, the end justified the means. Mexico wilted under the pressure, Holland won, Van Gaal's intervention was successful. It is this decisiveness that United are hoping to bottle next season, having faltered under Moyes, who seemed to struggle with the big calls. Moyes failed to replace Van Persie during a poor performance against Newcastle United. 'If I'd brought him off some people would say, ""What are you doing? You are 1-0 down and you're taking off your top goalscorer"",' Moyes admitted. Feeling down: David Moyes looks dejected on the sidelines as he sees United lose again . Making a difference: Van Gaal gives instructions as Holland came from behind to win . Famous pose: United were known for stunning late comebacks in Sir Alex Ferguson's time at the club . It is unlikely Van Gaal would ever factor public reaction into a decision. 'This trainer wants to win,' he said after the match in Fortaleza. 'He . makes the changes and the substitutions he needs. Nothing else matters. It's simple.' He says he . will have no qualms about dropping Van Persie  entirely if he feels . fitness issues have affected the performances of his captain. The way football is developing,  Van Gaal's hands-on approach is more . important than ever. Huntelaar's injury-time winner from the penalty . spot was the 25th goal scored at this World Cup by a substitute. The . ratio going into Monday's fixtures was a goal in every 2.08 games from a . player coming off the bench, meaning football can no longer be . considered 11  against 11. At World Cups in particular, when a . coach has 12 options on the sideline, game management is vital. As . rugby union has its invasion of replacements in the second half, . baseball its relief pitchers to close out the match, and hockey its . rolling substitutes, so football is increasingly demanding of the . coaches. One of the reasons Norwich City grew dissatisfied . with Chris Hughton was his substitutions. In these days of constant . statistical analysis, it was noted that almost a season had passed . without any of the players he had introduced scoring, or creating, a . goal. Jose Mourinho is regarded as one of the most inspired . game managers in football and Van Gaal is the coach who he says was his . greatest influence. Ferguson, the man whose feats the Dutchman must . aspire to as Manchester United manager, was never shy of the bold . gesture either. In this way, already, Van Gaal seems a more . natural fit than the instinctively cautious Moyes. United fell behind 20 . times and recovered to win on four occasions under Moyes. By contrast, . Holland have come back from behind three times already just at this . World Cup. It would appear United have found their man.

It was on Twitter in the early hours of Sunday morning, though, that the Manchester United winger hit the most pertinent note when he described tonight’s meeting with Liverpool in Miami as a ‘friendly’. The quotation marks said everything about the way both teams will approach the International Champions Cup final in Florida. A friendly it is not.

Shock to the system: United were thrashed 3-0 by Liverpool last season and finished 20 points behind them . Big game: Both clubs are expected to be a big pull in America, where pre-season is beginning to heat up . When these two clubs meet it is never anything other than deadly serious and as such the game represents the start of the competitive English club season. Forget Sunday’s Community Shield at Wembley, it is here in America that the first markers of the season will be made. Both United and Liverpool have things to prove this season and it begins in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore — architect of the doomed plan to play a 39th Premier League game abroad every season — will perhaps close his eyes and wonder about what might have been. For the two teams involved though, the motivation will be rather more traditional, certainly more fundamental. Something to shout about: Young said on Twitter that this game would be anything but friendly . Spot on: Darren Fletcher said that 'when United play Liverpool, it is always a big deal' Slalom: Shinji Kagawa takes his turn on the cones as United continued their pre-season preparations with a round of circuit training . United midfielder Darren Fletcher said: ‘It’s Man United versus Liverpool. I know it’s only pre-season and it’s just a summer competition, but when United play Liverpool, it is always a big deal. 'We want to win every match and it is no different when we play Liverpool. The main thing is winning games and getting that mentality back.’ United have more bad memories of last season than they know what to do with. A 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool in March stands out as one of the low points and a sea change in terms of the power balance between two great clubs. Since then, though, United have hired a successful World Cup manager and have breezed through pre-season games against LA Galaxy, AS Roma, Inter Milan. They saw off Real Madrid 3-1 on Saturday in front of 109,318 spectators at the Michigan Stadium, with Young scoring two and Javier Hernandez adding the third. Liverpool have also enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and booked their place in tonight’s final with a 2-0 win over AC Milan in Charlotte with goals from Joe Allen and Suso, although the game was notable for Rickie  Lambert missing a penalty — having scored his 34 previous spot-kicks with Southampton. Relaxed: Van Gaal has made a real impression since joining Manchester United after the World Cup . Bouncing back: United have been impressive in America with Ashley Young in particular playing well . The game throws up an intriguing clash between the two managers as Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers comes face to face with United’s new boss Louis van Gaal — the man he stopped from becoming a director of football at Anfield two years ago. Van Gaal had talks over a sporting-director role when Liverpool were looking for a new boss but when Rodgers was approached he insisted he would not work with someone in that position. When asked about whether it would add spice to the game, Rodgers insisted: ‘It was obviously something before I came in and I was always going to work with a team of people rather than a director of football. ‘It will be a great game because both teams will want to win. You will have two committed teams who are at the stage in pre-season where they are starting to step up a bit.’ Gearing up: Liverpool have seen off Olympiacos, Manchester City and AC Milan in the Champions Cup . VIDEO Liverpool v Manchester City highlights . Liverpool will find a United team highly motivated and confident enough to suggest that a journey from seventh to first in the space of one season may not be beyond them. Fletcher said: ‘I don’t think it’s too much to expect to make the leap back up the table, We will be going out to win the league. Hopefully, we can make amends for what happened last season. 'We have beaten Real Madrid, the European champions, and we now want to go on and beat Liverpool. That is the sort of thing that gives the squad confidence.’ Slip up: Gerrard is likely to be reminded of his untimely error by United fans on Monday . Liverpool’s failure to close out last season’s title provided United followers with some comfort in their year of austerity. Captain Steven Gerrard may be reminded of his part in that failure by rival fans in Miami tonight, but he will be comforted by the 20-point margin that separated the two teams last May.

Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha has vowed to become the player Louis van Gaal wants him to be after spending a year in the wilderness under previous Old Trafford manager David Moyes. Zaha was ignored by Moyes last season, and sent on loan to Cardiff in January after the Scot grew tired of what he believed was a poor attitude. It would appear the 21-year-old has much to prove to his new United boss, too, after Van Gaal waited until the second half of United’s third tour game — a penalty shootout win over Inter Milan on Tuesday — to hand Zaha his first action of pre-season. Re-United: Wilfried Zaha and former Red Devil Nemanja Vidic . Old Trafford lifeline: Zaha was handed a chance to impress against Inter Milan . Van Gaal has told him he must try to become a central striker to fit into his 3-5-2 system this season, and Zaha said: ‘I am used to being a winger, but if a manager wants me to adapt to a new position then I’ll have to. 'It’s not as much running as being a winger so I’ll take it! I have heard he likes to bring young players through so I’m buzzing to hear he will give youngsters a chance. ‘That’s all I really wanted since I came here. I just want to be a Man United player. Hopefully this season I will get the chance.’ Sir Alex Ferguson bought Zaha from Crystal Palace in January 2013. Moyes, however, seemed determined not to play him at times last season. ‘There was . so much pressure on him, so I can’t really blame him,’ added Zaha. ‘To . be honest, if you are not the manager’s cup of tea you can’t do anything . about it. It was definitely not my attitude. Eyes on the prize: Zaha hopes he can force his way into United's first-team plans . Out of favour: Zaha failed impress former manager David Moyes . ‘The manager had his way of playing and maybe I just didn’t suit it. This manager will tell you exactly how he wants it. ‘He . won’t beat about the bush or not tell you anything. He’ll just tell you . and that helps you, instead of isolating you or just not telling you. He will let you know exactly where you are and what you are doing . wrong.’ Van Gaal has no place for traditional wingers in his system and has said he can’t see Zaha as a wing back. For his part, Zaha is happy to still be at the club and vows to change his style. ‘I have worked on aspects of my game,’ he said. ‘One thing is keeping it simple. Losing the ball is not going to help your team. If I try to over-elaborate and lose the ball, that doesn’t help anyone.’ Advice: Louis Van Gaal has told Luke Shaw to get fit .

It is understood Van Gaal told Shaw he would not play until the game against Valencia a week on Tuesday, after failing to prove he was fit enough. However, injury to another defender, Reece James, this week left Van Gaal with little choice but to bring on Shaw, 19, against Inter at half-time. ‘He did a very hard training session on the morning of the game but he said he would play and he still did very good,’ said Van Gaal.","Former Crystal Palace star has been handed a lifeline by the Dutchman .

"By . Martin Samuel . It’s the group from hell, right? We’ve got no chance. Even that gentleman from the Football Association reckoned so. Drew a finger across his throat when the draw was made. We’ll be home before the business end of Wimbledon begins. Anyone for tennis? So let us start with that gloomy grab-bag of presumption. England do not have to steer a path through what the locals would call the inferno in Brazil this month. Even of late, they have had it worse, and qualified. In 2002 in Japan, for instance, Sven Goran Eriksson’s squad were up against Sweden, who they had not defeated since 1968, Argentina and Nigeria. Even in the last campaign, the 2012 European Championship, England faced France, Sweden again and the hosts, Ukraine. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gerrard say the squad has more confidence than four years ago . Group of death: Greg Dyke's slit-throat gesture showed what he thought of England's World Cup chances following the draw but he couldn't be more wrong . They made it through that time, too. Group D – Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica – sounds harder than it is, and not least because the matches come in precisely the right order. England could have had it better when the names came out of the hat, obviously, but they could not have improved on the schedule, a visit to tropical Manaus aside. It is, frankly pointless, however, complaining that a Brazilian World Cup is taking the team beyond its comfort zone into the Amazonian rainforest, as that is what a World Cup outside the Eurozone will always do. There will be heat, humidity, relatively remote locations and steps into the unknown and the sooner English football realises that and stops whinging about the weather every time a major tournament arrives, the more seriously this country will be taken as a competing nation. Not every competition can be held in Germany. And we stunk that joint out, mostly, in 2006 if you remember. So: Italy, Uruguay, Costa Rica – in that order. Got lucky there, didn’t we, whatever the FA’s resident drama queen might say. What if the fixtures had been reversed? Costa Rica in Manaus first, Italy last. Tricky, that. No fear: Wayne Rooney and England struck lucky with their group and should reach the last eight . The first game of a tournament is invariably cagey and Roy Hodgson, England’s manager, is not a natural risk-taker. Yet Costa Rica demand to be beaten, and beaten well, if goal difference is going to come into play as it often can in a tight group. England would be stepping into the unknown. Would 1-0 do? What if it was a draw? And imagine a draw, with Italy to play last. Glenn Hoddle took England to the 1998 World Cup by getting a result against the Italians, but his requirement was a draw in Rome. The fact is, England are playing Italy at precisely the right time, first – and in a location that offers equal disadvantage to all. When Dennis Bergkamp signed for Arsenal in 1995, Sir Alan Sugar, then in his capacity as chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, wondered how the expensive new arrival would fare when the cold weather kicked in. Downbeat: Antonio Cassano's Italy haven't won for seven games and on Wednesday drew with Luxembourg . June 14 - Italy, Manuas (11pm) June 19 - Uruguay, Sao Paulo (8pm) June 24 - Costa Rica, Belo Horizonte (5pm) *All times BST . This appeared to be a world view based on all of Italy being the temperature of Sardinia in July. Bergkamp was arriving from Milan, where a real fur coat is still a fashion accessory at the opera. It is fair to presume that nobody wears fur to the famous Teatro Amazonas opera house in Manaus. Turin, where Italian champions Juventus are based, hosted the Winter Olympics in 2006. Amazonian Brazil is just as inhospitable to most Italian players as it will be to their English opponents. Cesare Prandelli, Italy’s coach, has been working in sweat boxes and attempting scientific exercises in energy conservation just the same. And Italy are, by their footballing nature, cautious to begin with. It is another reason to play them first. Since the war, Italy have been involved in 14 opening fixtures at World Cups and for a supposed footballing powerhouse, have won just half of them. No great shakes: West Brom reject Diego Lugano (left) is Uruguay's captain - which says it all . They have never won any opening group game by more than two goals in that time – not even against Haiti in 1974 – and three of those seven wins have been achieved by a single goal margin. Faced with a dangerous opponent, Italy most often draw – against West Germany in 1962, Poland in 1982, Bulgaria in 1986, Chile in 1998 and Paraguay in 2010. Italy versus England in Manaus is the shortest price of any group game at the tournament to be a 0-0 draw: 7-1. Backing the stalemate is usually a mug’s game because a goal at either end kills the bet, but enough fancy it here for the bookmakers to lay at unappealing odds. Why? Italy are outs of sorts, haven’t won since September and drew 1-1 with Luxembourg in a friendly last week. They are perceived as cautious starters, Hodgson is perceived as cautious. Conditions in Manaus will be oppressive. Easily beatable: Costa Rica keeper Keilor Navas might have a lot of work to do during the tournament . In 13 World Cups England have only lost two opening games. Both times they made the quarter-finals . The pace of the game will be slow, wary, exhausting. If it gets to 70 minutes without a goal all instincts will be to settle. And, having not lost to the most difficult group opponents, England would be on their way. Uruguay are no great shakes. They have a great player, in Luis Suarez and one not far behind in Edinson Cavani, but five teams from nine in South America qualified for this tournament and Uruguay were last through the door via a play-off with Jordan. Nobody knows what shape Suarez will be in come June 19 in Sao Paulo, either. In other words they are beatable. A South American team on its own continent will always be a test but while the ordinary Diego Lugano, formerly of West Bromwich Albion, captains Uruguay, this not a match to be feared, but taken on. Difficult start: Sven Goran Eriksson's England had a tougher group in 2002 than the current team have . Leaving Costa Rica, by which time England’s destiny may be known. If England need to win, they should win. If they need to win by a margin, that should not be beyond possibility either. Qualify and one from Colombia, Ivory Coast, Japan and Greece await in the next round. Jose Mourinho tipped England to reach the last eight, at least, and he is no poor judge. England should have every reason to anticipate and experience the colour and warmth of football’s spiritual homecoming without fear or despair. Nobody is predicting triumph – but disaster should be equally foreign to this campaign. We can have a go. We should have a go. What would be the point otherwise?","England have had worse qualifying groups in previous tournaments .

Part of the way through a group interview with newspaper reporters in America this week, Louis van Gaal paused when presented with a theory about Manchester City’s current eminence in the  Barclays Premier League. ‘I have learned the word “entice”. You are enticing me,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I said “provoke” yesterday but Ryan Giggs said it’s “entice”. That is what you are trying to do.’ Welcome to the world of the new Manchester United manager. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal looking for defensive reinforcements . No quick fix: Louis van Gaal has conducted his first in-depth interview as manager of Manchester United . Address: Van Gaal giving a team talk to his players during a session in Denver on Friday . VIDEO Van Gaal looking for defensive reinforcements . Complex and occasionally contradictory, but rarely anything other than fascinating. It is fair to suggest that life inside the  Manchester United dressing room is currently not dull. Take another example. This time when Van Gaal was asked whether the stereotype of a typical English footballer — fit, fuelled by adrenaline and emotion, but  lacking sophistication — was true. ‘That is your opinion,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You say it, then you say I have to say it. I don’t know because I have to know the players first then I can judge. You can judge because you have been a journalist for many years and have seen the culture. ‘I have said the players under the direction of David Moyes were a lot different from the players under the direction of Alex Ferguson, but also under me. ‘But we shall have to wait and see. From the outside it is fair to say what you have said. But I don’t want to be judging as an outsider. ‘I want to hear that and feel that but at the moment they are doing great.’ Plans: Van Gaal (left) speaks alongside Chris Smalling at the press conference in Maryland . Drills: Jonny Evans (centre), Danny Welbeck (left) and Wilfried Zaha (second left) taking part in the session . Jonny keen to impress: Evans trains between Will Keane (left) and Michael Keane (right) Van Gaal has few complaints about his United players so far. Certainly not in terms of their attitude. He knows the squad he inherited from Moyes is not good enough — calling it ‘broken’ — and is trying to fix it both in the transfer market and on the training field. He says he will not buy players for the short term and is more concerned with nurturing players’ minds on the training field. It will, he says, be a long process but he believes he has evidence it will work. ‘The way you see Barcelona still playing with six players from my time is because I gave a lot of chances to the youth players,’ said Van Gaal. ‘The structure and the culture of the club is Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Carles Puyol, Victor Valdes and Thiago Motta (his players, though Puyol, Valdes and Motta have left). ‘At Bayern Munich it was the same. My players. Every club where I have been, I have struggled for the first three months. After that, they know what I want. How I am as a human being and a manager. ‘I say things as they are, so you have to adapt to that way of coaching. It’s not so easy. I train the brains and not the legs. I’m direct. I am not for running. I am for running with the ball, but they like that of course. ‘A lot of these players are playing intuitively and I want them to think and know why they do something. ‘That’s a process that is difficult and it takes time.’ Hoping to impress: Wayne Rooney has is one of those out to impress his new manager . Boss: Luke Shaw chats to Louis van Gaal as the Manchetser United players warm up . Some coaches obsess about the bigger picture, others scrutinise in astonishing detail. It seems Van Gaal will attempt to do both. Stories of life on tour with the Dutch veteran already include minute changes to seating arrangements in restaurants and an almost frightening obsession with time-keeping. Interestingly, he is an hour late for this interview, but, just as during the World Cup, he is worth it. Over the course of a 25-minute chat he reveals more than it is  possible to chronicle in detail here. He says he was approached about the United job in the 1990s, for example. ‘I was already asked to join United in the 90s because  Ferguson wanted to quit at that time,’ he said. ‘That would have been easier. ‘I don’t think it’s easy now because when you have a club that normally plays from first position, and now you are seventh, then you know the team is not in balance or is broken, or that the confidence or something like that is wrong. ‘I had to follow Bobby Robson at Barcelona. He had won three titles. That was easier. I don’t think  “broken” is a hard word because when you are seventh the team is not happy, and without confidence, and when you are like that you are broken. ‘So now they have me. A new manager, new chances for the players and they want to show themselves unbelievably. That is nice that they want to do that. ‘But we have to make a way of playing football that is not the same as before, and that is difficult for them. They have to perform under pressure. They have to decide  what to do with the ball within one second and that is not easy.’ Power trio: Van Gaal chats with Ryan Giggs and David Beckham last week in Los Angeles . All smiles: The trio looking incredibly cheerful as they pose for a photo . There has been much talk about Van Gaal’s new playing formation at United and it remains valid. It is radically different from what has gone before and the coach is perhaps right to warn of teething problems. What strikes you most about him, however, is his sheer self-belief, a confidence that stretches almost to the point of utter conviction. Certainly we didn’t see that from Moyes, who, in fairness, didn’t have a c.v. like his successor’s to bolster him. ‘I already had a lot of opportunities to work in England,’ said Van Gaal. ‘But at the time the priority was not like it is now. I am already 62, so my career is reaching the end. I was in Spain, Germany and Netherlands so there’s only one football country I wanted to see inside and that was England. I had more offers than just Manchester United. ‘I don’t say it’s a dream, because I am 62 and I know what I can do and I think United know what I can do and I think that is why they have come for me. I am not a child any more, but it’s fantastic because not any coach can work with the  biggest clubs. 'I have experience because I worked in Spain and  Germany with the No 1 clubs. I speak the language and, for me, communication is very important.’ Van Gaal has a reputation for a rather hard-line attitude with the media. So far, it has not been  apparent. He was skilful enough to duck questions about Chelsea and saw the Manchester City one coming like a train hurtling down a mile of straight track. One-nil to him,  perhaps. He knows the threat from across town to be real, though. ‘It does not bother me whether they are 10 metres away or 30 kilometres,’ he said. ‘It is amazing because they were not a big club before but now they are knocking at the door. But that is good, because where there is competition you can be proud when you are the champion. At the end maybe we will be the champions!’","Van Gaal embracing his new role as manager of Manchester United .

'In the second half we didn’t keep the ball in possession. That’s all we had to do, to keep the ball and make the opponent run and run and run. 'It’s very difficult for them in the hot weather but we forgot to that so we brought Roma back in to the match. I am pleased we have won but it was no good.'

United continued their good pre-season form on Saturday with a 3-2 win over Roma here in Colorado. Just as he did in beating LA Galaxy 7-0 last week, Van Gaal played almost entirely different teams in each half at Sports Authority Field today but Zaha was not given a run-out. VIDEO Scroll down to watch fiery Wilfried Zaha in pitch fight with teammate Ravel Morrison . Out of favour: Wilfried Zaha faces a battle to impress new manager Louis van Gaal . Trainers: (L-R) Reece James, Will Keane, Zaha, Antonio Valencia and Javier Hernandez . The young winger is now the only player not to have played a single minute on tour. Van Gaal has even managed to give three goalkeepers at least a half each but hasn’t managed to get Zaha on to the field. The former Crystal Palace player trained fully with his team-mates here yesterday and is not thought to be injured. It would appear, therefore, that he faces a battle to show Van Gaal he is worth persevering with after enduring a difficult season under David Moyes last time round.

He started well enough in South Wales but his form soon dipped and he ended the season on the bench as Cardiff were relegated from the Barclays Premier League. When asked about Zaha, Van Gaal said: ‘I have a lot of strikers. I have six. Maybe he will play centre forward next. He has worked well in training.

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . New seasons bring — among other things — opportunities to replenish or repair reputations. Juan Mata perhaps fits into the latter category. The star signing of David Moyes’ torrid eight months at Manchester United, the Spanish playmaker failed to such an extent last season that the first thing Ryan Giggs did when handed brief control of the team last April was drop him. Mata was, quite simply, the signing that never seemed to fit. Here in America, though, hope springs for the former Chelsea player. New United manager Louis van Gaal has confided to his associates that the 26-year-old is the man he wants to play behind Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie this season and Mata has the look of a footballer ready to make up for lost time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal take charge of Manchester United shooting practice . Chance: After a disappointing season, Juan Mata has a chance to fulfil his potential under Louis van Gaal . ‘It was difficult last season,’ said Mata. ‘We had changed managers but didn’t get the results. But we are starting a new season with a new manager and we aim to put the club back where it deserves to be. Things are changing and everyone is finding their new role in the team. That includes me.’ Mata’s influence at United in the wake of his arrival last January was negligible. When Giggs was appointed interim manager for the last four games of the season, he was right to leave the Spaniard out. Good players should influence games wherever they play and Mata failed to do that. As such, he has much to prove. Nevertheless, Mata’s cause was not helped by the fact Moyes didn’t seem to know where to play him. Often marooned out on the left, he rarely saw any game time behind the two strikers and United suffered as a result. Celebration: Manchester United players celebrate scoring their second of the evening in Colorado . Partners: Mata will get his chance to play the No 10 role this season behind Rooney and Robin van Persie . VIDEO Heat and altitude affected us - Van Gaal . Under Van Gaal, Mata has already been stationed in his favourite spot and on Saturday against Roma he flourished, scoring a lovely goal after a sensational pass from Rooney in the first half.  ‘If I play behind the two strikers I feel comfortable,’ he said. ‘I have played on the left or right but my best season was when I played in that position under Rafa Benitez for Chelsea. I will try my best, during the season hopefully we can play good football and I can do assists and score goals because that is what I have to do. ‘We feel the manager is a great manager who has brought a strong mentality. This club is made for a winning mentality and I think he has it. We are happy with him and the way he works. Everything is new but we are adapting well to his style of football.’ Wide of the mark: Both David Moyes and Jose Mourinho played Mata on the wing, a position he does not enjoy . New State of mind: Mata in action against Roma as part of Manchester United's pre-season tour . Juan Mata mainly played as a No 10 for Rafa Benitez - where he was more effective - while Jose Mourinho and David Moyes mainly used him out wide. Under Benitez (Nov 2012 - May 2013) Games: 25 . Goals: 8 . Assists: 6 . Chances created: 69 . Under Moyes and Mourinho (June 2013 - May 2014) Games: 25 . Goals: 3 . Assists: 6 . Chances created: 58 . With Van Gaal trying to introduce the same playing system at United he used to take Holland to the last four of the World Cup this summer, Mata could be in line to benefit. On Saturday in sweltering Colorado, he linked up beautifully with Rooney and this is an understanding that Van Gaal will hope develops over the coming weeks. Yet United produced a peculiar display at Sports Authority Field. They should have been a couple of goals down early on before scoring three times in nine minutes before half-time and then slipping back into a torpor in the second half. Roma’s first goal, scored from inside his own half by the Bosnian Miralem Pjanic, was a thing of wonder but the more mundane fact is that United were hanging on at the end. ‘We didn’t play a good match,’ admitted Van Gaal. ‘Maybe it was the altitude ... but we scored remarkable goals. Fantastic. ‘In the second half we didn’t keep the ball in possession. That’s all we had to do, to keep the ball and make the opponent run and run and run. It’s very difficult for them in the hot weather but we forgot to do that so we brought Roma back into the match. I am pleased we have won but it was no good. No 10: Juan Mata he enjoyed playing for Rafa Benitez because he played him in his favourite position . ‘The club agreed this game before I got here. I am not used to the hot weather. I was here in 1994 for the World Cup and games were played at noon. It’s not very wise. You have to play football at the right time. I’m sorry to say that.’ United go to Washington on Monday ahead of a game against Inter Milan on Tuesday. After that comes Detroit and Real Madrid on Saturday. If they win both they will be obliged to stay in America three extra days and contest an International Champions Cup final in Miami.

Centre forward Wayne Rooney scored twice against Galaxy at Pasadena Rose Bowl on Wednesday and is hoping to thrive in Van Gaal’s new 3-5-2 system. The Dutch coach has said that this system is designed to incorporate two strikers and a ‘number ten’ and Rooney hopes that will help him forget about the disappointment of England’s World Cup summer. 'Of course the system is good for me,' said Rooney. 'It’s great to hear the manager say he wants to play two strikers as we have a few.

It was a good result and good to get 45 minutes under my belt. Louis van Gaal has been great. 'I’ve only had a few days but he’s a strong guy who has been good in training and it’s been enjoyable. 'He is bringing in a new style of play and wants us all to adapt to that and that’s been enjoyable. It was good to see it work against Galaxy.' Rooney would have hoped to joined United’s tour later, given that progress for England in Brazil would have delayed his arrival in America. However, the 28-year-old claimed this week that he has already put the World Cup – and the criticism that came on the back of England’s early exit – behind him. 'Was I criticised in the world Cup?' he asked. 'I honestly didn’t know. But I think that happens. It’s the world we live in. No messing about: Van Gaal appears to have made his mark on the United squad already since joining . 'I came to understand that a few years ago. I’m not concerned about it at all. It was disappointing the way the World Cup went but I said at the time it was time for me to look forward and concentrate on Manchester United. 'That is what I am doing. I am just trying to get fit and get ready for the season. It was always the plan for me to come on the tour. 'We had a schedule depending on how we did in the World Cup. The Spanish lads are here as well. But it’s great to be here. I have had a good break and I’m happy to be here. 'We have a few weeks before the season starts and all this is just preparing for the first game against Swansea. We have to try and put our efforts in to what Louis wants.' Van Gaal has not indicated yet who he feels will be his captain at United. Rooney, who would have been handed the role had David Moyes still been in charge, would love the job and feels that United can launch a serious assault on the Barclays Premier League title this season. On target: Rooney scored a first-half penalty in United's 7-0 pre-season friendly win against LA Galaxy . 'Of course we can win the title,' he said. 'Last season was a bad one, we know that, but we are confident we can put it right. We have to believe we can win the title. 'Of course I would like the captaincy but it’s the managers decision who he chooses. 'I think he wants to work with the players and then choose a captain from there. I don’t think he was ever going to just walk in and choose a player from the off.  I’m sure he will look at the players now and make his decision in a couple of weeks. 'He’s very honest in training. If you are not doing well in training he will tell you but if you do well he will praise you. 'If you aren’t doing things right in training you need to know so that you can put them right. In Brazil I watched the way Holland were playing and I carried on doing that when I came home. 'However you can watch as much as you want but it’s when you hear him getting his point across in training that you start to learn.'","Van Gaal to meet Ferguson for the first time as United boss this weekend .

Manchester United defender Phil Jones is ready to prove himself a credible replacement for Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic as he prepares to become part of Louis van Gaal’s new three-man back line. With Ferdinand and Vidic no longer at Old Trafford, it will be up to Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans to prove to new United boss Van Gaal that they are good enough to move his team forwards. Van Gaal is hoping to buy at least one central defender between now and the start of the season – with Thomas Vermaelen and Mats Hummels under current consideration – as he looks to impose a new 3-5-2 system on the team he inherited from David Moyes. In contention: Phil Jones started Louis van Gaal's first game in charge of Manchester United . Big chance: Jones wants to replace Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic who have left United . The system got its first airing in the 7-0 tour defeat of LA Galaxy here on Wednesday and Van Gaal has confirmed he will use it when United begin their Barclays Premier League campaign next month. Last night Jones said: 'Of course, replacing those guys is ultimately what I want to be doing. Everyone is trying to impress and hopefully we can start the season off well. ‘You’ve got to thrive on the challenge. ‘We’ve lost two great defenders in Rio and Nemanja. But that’s football and we move on. ‘We’ve got good players to replace them and hopefully we can all step up and improve that. ‘You get used to a new system. This is the first time I’ve played three at the back. ‘Every manager has got his philosophy. We’re all pulling in the right direction and hopefully we’ll have a better season. ‘It’s not a massive difference to what you’re used to. You’re a defender and you’ve got to defend.

VIDEO United will continue to spend - Woodward . Van Gaal believes a 3-5-2 formation is the best way to get the maximum out of his attacking options. Jones, though, knows he must cement a place in the side if he is to justify the fanfare that greeted his arrival from Blackburn in 2011. The United manager has said he will look at everybody in the squad before buying players and Jones said: ‘That’s encouraging for everyone. ‘Everyone is trying to impress and it’s only right that we give everything we’ve got and prove to the manager that we’re worthy of starting the first game of the season. ‘The way this system works, if one of us goes in the other two have got to come round and cover. ‘But it’s the same when you’re playing two at the back, one goes up for a header and the other comes round. ‘Of course, as a defender you need a lot of communication. It’s about talking to the people around you and if we get that right we’ll be good. ‘The lads have been brilliant in training. The gaffer has told us how he wants us to play and the way he wants to play this season. ‘It’s a learning process but we’re all pulling in the right direction.’ United will arrive in Denver on Friday ahead of the second leg of their two-and-a-half week tour of America.

Scholes was part of the coaching set-up at the end of last season as former team-mate Ryan Giggs took over from sacked David Moyes for the final four games in the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch former Red Devil Paul Scholes showing he can still tackle hard . Watching brief: Paul Scholes (left) was on the touchline on Tuesday as Salford City took on Stalybridge Celtic, the team he co-owns, in pre-season friendly . Many people thought Scholes had burned his bridges with the club over the summer, though, after criticising some United players in a World Cup column he wrote for a betting company. Scholes questioned whether Wayne Rooney was already past his best at 28 and why the club had spent £30million on defender Luke Shaw. It is understood, though, that current manager Louis van Gaal and chief executive Ed Woodward still believe the former England star still has something to offer and that Scholes has been told that the club would be happy to talk. Scholes will not be offered a job with the first team coaching pool as Van Gaal is now happy with this immediate staff. Helping out: Scholes was part of Ryan Giggs' coaching set-up at the end of last season . However, United feel that Scholes could offer the club a great deal by returning to work with young players, possibly alongside current coach Nicky Butt.

Caught in the act at the Karaiskakis Stadium, the United chief executive, arm outstretched, looked a little like a fan, a tourist. Woodward, though, took that photograph for a reason.

He said: 'You need to score the first one and I asked two players to take the first ball before ending up with Vlaar.

One of the BBC’s most familiar voices for four decades, James Alexander Gordon, is bowing out from reading the classified football results on radio after having his larynx removed. The 77-year-old has tantalised, delighted and disappointed listeners on Radio 2 and then Radio 5 Live but his voice is no longer strong enough to broadcast after surgery to treat throat cancer.

Hanging up his mic: James Alexander Gordon is one of the most recognisable voices on radio . ""It's with great sorrow that I have to give up the most exciting part of my career, the classified football results,"" said the 77-year-old Scot. ""They have been my life."" Edinburgh-born Gordon, whose delivery often made it possible for fans to predict the fortune of their team simply from the inflection, has often admitted he knows little about football other than the results. Just last year he said he had no plans whatsoever to step down from his role. 'I keep telling the BBC they will have to carry me out on a stretcher. I’ll die with the microphone in my hand,' he said in an interview. But the BBC said today that although his surgery was successful, 'sadly his voice is now not strong enough to broadcast'. Richard Burgess, head of BBC Radio Sport, said: 'This is desperately sad news for everyone at BBC Sport and we know our sadness will be shared by many millions of listeners. 'It’s not an exaggeration to say that Saturdays at 5pm will never be the same again without the warm, melodious sound of James’s voice just after the Sports Report theme on BBC Radio 5 Live. A voice which is, of course, recognised around the globe through the BBC World Service and a voice which embodies authority, clarity and charm. 'For so many of us, James has been a mainstay in our lives - a reassuring and reliable presence every week. He is a broadcasting legend.' Great voice: Gordon's inflection meant you knew exactly how your team had done . Affectionate: Popular presenter Mark Pougatch said Gordon was recognisble even to those disinterested . Mark Pougatch, presenter of 5 Live Sport, said: 'Even people who don’t really even like football knew who James was, even if they didn’t realise it. 'Such was James’s unique style of reading the classifieds, his wonderful inflections and stresses, that even non-believers of the sport knew the result after the home team’s score. 'Nobody else will be able to say ‘Wolverhampton Wanderers’ with quite such mellifluous tones. 'But enough of this ‘James’. To those of us lucky enough to work at BBC Radio Sport, he is JAG. 'And JAG is an institution, a legend and a gentleman all rolled into one.' Gordon, who contracted polio as a child and had to wear leg supports until his late teens, officially retired from the BBC many years ago but has continued as a freelancer. He joined the BBC as an announcer and newsreader after a career in music publishing.

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . ‘Three goalkeepers one problem’ was the headline on one of Madrid’s leading sports papers Diario AS on Friday morning. Real Madrid want to complete the signing of Keylor Navas from Levante but they already have Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez. Over at Marca, the rival of Diario AS, a solution was being offered. Maybe Lopez could be sold to Chelsea, after all it was Jose Mourinho who signed him for Real Madrid in the first place. All well and good apart from the fact that Chelsea already have Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois. The surplus of good keepers, along with the stockpiling of talent at most top Champions League clubs means that Petr Cech, Pepe Reina, Iker Casillas, Joe Hart, Victor Valdes, Diego Lopez, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Wojciech Szczesny could all be sat on the bench for large parts of next season because their clubs also have Courtois, Simon Mignolet, Keylor Navas, Claudio Bravo, Willy Caballero and David Ospina to pick instead. VIDEO Scroll dwon to watch Thibaut Coutois stranded by Eden Hazard's chip . In limbo: Diego Lopez (left) and Iker Casillas (right) will have to do battle with the incoming Keylor Navas . Under pressure: Szczesny (left) and Hart (right) will have to compete with new arrivals at Arsenal and City . You can argue about the details. Hart will probably keep his place ahead of Caballero (although believing that to be a formality is to ignore how Caballero has been among the top three goalkeepers in Spain in each of the last three seasons). Likewise Casillas might keep his place ahead of Navas. And Szczesny could well fend off Ospina’s challenge. But however the chips fall there will be a lot of very good keepers not playing regularly. Atletico Madrid were expected to ease the congestion by signing one of the surplus stoppers but they opted instead for another young talent – Jan Oblak the 21-year-old Slovenian - so there are still too many keepers for the places available and the way the World Cup was dominated by goalkeepers has done nothing to change that. Mexico’s Guillermo Ochoa has earned a move to Malaga after his performance against Brazil. And after finishing third in Fifa’s Golden Glove rating Serio Romero moved to Benfica. Victor Valdes’ injury ruined his proposed move to replace Romero at Monaco. The Ligue 1 club could yet offer Diego Lopez a way out of Madrid. Uphill battle: Courtois (left) and Reina (right) will have to dislodge Cech and Mignolet . Settling for No 2 status is one alternative open to him and maybe, if Cech were to move to PSG, Lopez could end-up as Courtois’ stand-in at Chelsea. But experienced number twos only served to block the progress of young keepers – the highly rated Jordi Masip now finds his path to the first team blocked by Bravo and Ter Stegen at Barcelona. And the senior goalkeepers themselves invariably suffer. Coaches and directors of football might say that is just part of the modern game – top clubs need two first-team keepers.  But the performances of Casillas in the Champions League final and World Cup after a season on the bench during Real Madrid’s league campaign suggest it doesn’t exactly improve personal performance. Most goalkeepers believe they have to be playing every week to reach top form. That’s why Keylor Navas was not interested in a move to Bayern Munich where he would have spent most of this time watching Manuel Neuer.

While many have speculated over new La Liga fixtures managing to put the first Clasico of the season on the weekend that Luis Suarez comes back from his four-month ban. To ensure Suarez played a full-part in that first Real Madrid vs Barcelona game of the season the Spanish League would have needed to schedule it a bit later. If they fixed it they made a pretty bad job of it. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez get locked out of his in-laws house in Barcelona . Return date? Luis Suarez could make his  first Barcelona appearance against Real Madrid . Big draw: Barca fans will be keen to see their new man in action against their fierce rivals . If the game is played on Saturday October 25 Suarez will still not be eligible (it will be the last day of his ban) and if it’s played on Sunday 26 he still will not have trained with his team-mates at least not under the current FIFA restrictions on him so much as running around a training pitch with them. Spanish football will want Suarez on the pitch for what is already being billed as the BBC (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) against SNM (Suarez, Neymar and Messi). But the Spanish League computer has not made that a certainty. It should be game-on however in the second half of the season. When the meeting in the Camp Nou comes around in March we will see the two most expensive forward lines in history battle it out. The game at the Camp Nou falls on the weekend of March 21-22. VIDEO El Clasico fixed for Suarez return date . Not fooling anyone: Suarez holds his teeth after sinking them into the shoulder of Giorgio Chiellini . Cover up! Suarez holds his face to suggest that he had only collided with the Italian defender . October  26 - Real Madrid (A) January 11 - Atletico Madrid (H) March 22 - Real Madrid (H) May 17 - Atletico Madrid (A) As always the Spanish season repeats the first half of the campaign with games in exactly the same order. The first six weeks of the season are usually blocked-out by the League computer preventing a Madrid vs Barcelona match happening too early in the season and therefore the return leg also happening too late. The last six weeks are also blocked preventing a Madrid v Barcelona match coming too close to Champions League semi-finals so that effectively leaves quite a small window of opportunity. Barcelona president Jose Maria Bartomeu was sat next to Florentino Perez at Spanish League headquarters along with the other 18 club presidents on Thursday lunchtime. He will now hope more than ever that when the court of arbitration for sport reviews the Suarez case in the second week in August it will change the draconian ruling that prevents him so much as training. Signed: James Rodriguez was unveiled as a Real Madrid player on Tuesday at the Santiago Bernabeu . He’ll want the European Golden Boot winner as fit as possible to take on Pepe and Sergio Ramos in the old enemy’s amphitheater. Because there are Champions League games the week previous to the weekend of October 25-26 the game will almost certainly be scheduled for the Sunday so it could be some debut for Suarez, albeit from the bench after his four months out of action. 'It’s all still a long way off,' said Real Madrid spokesman Emilio Butragueño. It must seem that way for Barca’s sidelined striker.","Suarez may be able to make his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid .

On Tuesday, Real Madrid added James Rodriguez to an abundance of attacking talent that includes Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. Last season they won the Champions League, breaking the record for goals scored, now manager Carlo Ancelotti has the enviable task of finding room for the winner of the Golden Boot at the World Cup. Reach for the stars: James Rodriguez is the final piece in the most expensive team in world football . Two become three: Bale and Ronaldo will have to make room for one more superstar in the Madrid XI . Expensive: £86m Gareth Bale . Rich: £60m James Rodriguez . Pricey: £80m Cristiano Ronaldo .

The Colombian scored six goals in five games in Brazil, declared an immediate preference for Real Madrid over Barcelona and having just turned 23, he has his best years ahead of him. As galacticos go, he ticks all the boxes. Thousands of supporters packed into the Bernabeu on Tuesday evening to welcome the former Monaco midfielder, who has signed for six years and will earn about £110,000-a-week. For Madrid, signing the Jorge Mendes-managed player and dealing with Monaco owner Dmitry Rybolovlev has been far easier than Tottenham’s chairman Daniel Levy, who made them sweat until the end of last August for the services of Bale. Real president Florentino Perez addressed supporters in the Bernabeu and had his name chanted as if he were another of the club’s cast of superstars. The rest of football was left asking how Real manage the annual outlay and how Ancelotti will now manage to keep all his players happy. The answer to both questions will, in part, be in the sale of players. Just as last year the transfer of Gonzalo Higuain to Napoli and Mesut Ozil to Arsenal helped finance the capture of Bale, so this year Sami Khedira, Angel Di Maria and, if the right offer arrives, Isco, will help pay for the new arrivals. Incoming Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas will require the departure of Diego Lopez or Iker Casillas. Dream team: New acquisition Toni Kroos will make part of the £375million Galacticos side . Delighted: Real Madrid president Florentino Perez unveils Toni Kroos following his move . Real: Karim Benzema signed from Lyon in 2009 and he too is part of the £375m dream team . Skills: Rodriguez showed played up to the crowd with some flicks and tricks out on the pitch . Arrival: Rodriguez poses with a ball during his presentation on the pitch at the Santiago Bernabeu . Money raised in the transfer market, along with Madrid’s shared stranglehold over La Liga television revenue with Barcelona, has long helped keep them on top of football’s rich list, although before the arrival of Ancelotti they were unable to convert that dominance into European trophies. Now the Italian, who in Lisbon last season guided them to their first Champions League in 11 years, will have to accommodate Rodriguez, who operates best as the No 10 in a 4-2-3-1. If Ancelotti opts for that system, the new boy will be flanked by Ronaldo and Bale behind Benzema in attack, and Xabi Alonso or Luka Modric will partner last week’s £24m signing Toni Kroos in midfield. Ancelotti is the master pragmatist and could also play 4-4-2 with a diamond midfield that has Rodriguez at the top and Alonso at the base with Modric and Kroos either side and Bale and Ronaldo up-front at the expense of Benzema. Neither system accommodates Di Maria, Khedira or Isco, who must now be wishing he had followed his former boss Manuel Pellegrini to Manchester City last summer instead of moving to Madrid.

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . James Rodriguez was only 14 years old when he was thrown into a relegation battle in Colombia’s Liga Postobon with his first club Envigado. Unable to keep them up after a 15-year run in the top flight the club that had taken a gamble on the slight-of-frame midfielder found themselves in the second division. The teenager was not about to let them down though. Rodriguez led the team that got the Medellin-based side back into the top division the following season scoring nine goals in 22 games and making South America sit up and take notice of what was clearly going to be the next big thing. VIDEO Scroll down to watch James Rodriguez give the thumbs-up during his Real medical . Galactico: Colombia's James Rodriguez is on the verge of signing for Real Madrid from Monaco . Short stay: Rodriguez signed for Monaco in May 2013 but caught Real Madrid's eye at the 2014 World Cup . Golden Boot: Six goals in Brazil made him the tournament's top scorer and alerted the world to his talents . Argentine side Banfield took the most notice and signed the youngster putting him on a high-protein diet and weights regime to toughen him up for the rigours of league football in Argentina. He made a slow start under Jorge Burruchaga but when the World Cup hero from Argentina’s 1986 success in Mexico lost his job after a string of bad results Julio Cesar Falcioni came in and decided to build his team around Rodriguez. In the 2009-10  season he scored nine goals in 38 games as Banfield won the league. That was enough to earn him a move to Europe and with Jorge Mendes guiding him he landed at Porto for 7.5m euros, despite interest from Espanyol and Udinese. He played in the Andre Villas-Boas team that won the Europa League in his first season in 2011 and he won three leagues in three seasons at Porto playing his way into Jose Pekerman’s Colombia team making his debut in 2011. The success in Portugal persuaded Monaco to pay 45m euros for Rodriguez in 2013  and in his first, and last season, he scored 10 goals in 38 games. In an exclusive interview with MailSport before the World Cup his Colombia team-mate Radamel Falcao picked him out to be a star of the tournament. That seemed like pals, compatriots and club team-mates looking out for one another at the time, but events in Brazil proved otherwise as Rodriguez became player of the tournament in all but name. Tip: Monaco and Colombia team-mate Radamel Falcao backed him to star at the World Cup . Silverware: Rodriguez won the Portuguese league title at Porto under Andre Villas-Boas . Trio: Rodriguez could line up alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in a 4-2-3-1 formation for Real Madrid . His stunning World Cup, scoring six times in five games to win the Golden Boot – including the goal of the tournament against Uruguay – was all the encouragement Real Madrid needed to celebrate winning their tenth Champions League by making him their big signing. President Florentino Perez was always going to wait to see which new star emerged in Brazil before signing this season’s ‘Galactico’ and Rodriguez became that player with a string of sensational displays, some post-knockout emotional interviews, and no shortage of charm. To say he made the right noises after the World Cup would be an understatement. The tears were barely dry after Colombia’s exit against Brazil when he declared: ‘I prefer Madrid to Barcelona’. He then told Marca: ‘I would go to Madrid with my eyes closed. It would be a dream to play for them. The first time I went to the Bernabeu I said to myself: “I want to play here one day”.’ The wheels were well and truly in motion and with Mendes, the agent he shares with his new team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo, at the heart of negotiations the move went through with little or no resistance from Monaco's Russian president Dmitry Rybolovlev. After seeing the BBC forward line of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano shoot their way to Champions League glory aided and abetted by Luka Modric and Angel Di Maria last season all that remains now is for Carlo Ancelotti to find a way of fitting in all his superstars. Conundrum: Real coach Carlo Ancelotti could have trouble finding space for all his star names . Angel Di Maria and Sami Khedira could face uncertain futures at Real Madrid following Rodriguez's arrival . James is happiest in a 4-2-3-1 playing as the No 10. He could line up between Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in a formidable second line of attack behind Karim Benzema and in front of midfield pairing Toni Kroos and Luka Modric. That will be the preference of President Perez. All Ancelotti and the club’s director general Jose Angel Sanchez will have to do then is find a home for, or a way of keeping happy, Xabi Alonso, Sami Khedira, Isco, Di Maria and Jese… just another summer at Real Madrid.

The European champions have just added James Rodriguez to their squad for a cool £60million. The crafty Colombian joins Gareth Bale (£86million), Cristiano Ronaldo (£80million), Karim Benzema (£28million) and Toni Kroos (£24million). Real sell two types of season ticket. One for the club’s 19 league home games and one for all games including home Champions League and home Copa del Rey matches.

The price of the league ticket (Abono tradicional) range from £175 to £1450 and the all inclusive ‘Euroabono’ range from £254 to £1879. You have to be a socio (member of the club) to buy a season ticket and that also costs money with an annual payment of around £120. As there are far more socios than season tickets, waiting lists are long and many members pay their annual subscription to be a member but can do no more than try to buy tickets on a game-by-game basis from season ticket holders who can’t attend matches. A Madrid fan buying the most expensive season ticket for £1879 + £120 membership pays out £1997 and if Madrid reach the semi-final stage of both the Champions League and the Copa del Rey he gets 29 games for his euros at £68 a match.

You’ll only get wet if you’re in the ‘cheap’ seats as most of the ground is covered and if you are close enough to the directors’ box you should just about feel the warmth coming from the overhead heaters.

The club’s lawyers are hoping that FIFA will allow them to make a ‘fast-track’ appeal to the Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS) in Lausanne in a bid to lift the ban on the player training with his new team-mates. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique with the latest on Suarez . Plenty to discuss: Luis Enrique (right) and Andoni Zubizarreta arrive for the press conference . Done deal: Suarez arrives in Barcelona on Tuesday to complete the transfer from Liverpool . But Enrique put on a brave face . at the club’s Joan Gamper training complex saying: 'It’s not a tragedy. It’s not ideal but it does not serve as any excuse. Another player will . take his place with the Barcelona badge on his shirt and represent the . club. 'The ideal situation . is to have all the players at my disposal but we knew that he (Suarez) couldn’t train for four months when we signed him. The season is very . long and there will be time for all players to play.' Asked . if the club had compromised its ‘More than a club’ slogan by signing a . player banned by FIFA Sporting Director Andoni Zubizarreta said: 'The . philosophy has never been about us claiming to be perfect. 'We . accept human beings with all their imperfections. People get things . right and they get things wrong and they can then have the capacity to . learn from mistakes. Standing firm: Former Barca and Spain goalkeeper Zubizaretta defended the signing of Suarez . 'In the . history of this club we have had some good days and some bad days. What . we have always done is learn from our mistakes and turn them into . positives. I am sure that Luis will be a positive force for this club in . the future.' Barcelona’s . situation is a delicate one because they can only use the fast-track . appeal process with CAS if Fifa allow them to. If Fifa turn them down . they would be forced into a much longer appeal process or have to seek . redress in another court. Zubizarreta . said: 'Our lawyers tell us that we have to be very prudent in what we . say about the matter. We have to give them time to mount the best case . before we say any more about the issue.' Lawyers . working on behalf of the player are hopeful that the independent . committee that banned Suarez from all football-related activity for four . months went beyond the limits of its jurisdiction prohibiting him from . working for his new employer. New chapter: Luis Enrique embarks on his first season as Barca manager after succeeding Gerardo Martino . They . will also argue that because the player will need time after his . four-month ban from training with team-mates to have a pre-season, the . ban effectively becomes much longer and therefore punishes the player . and the club more. In his . first press conference since Barça’s return to training the Zubizarreta . also said that the futures of both Xavi Hernandez and Dani Alves . remained up in the air and defended himself against criticism that he . had dragged his feet over signing a new centre-back. Barcelona . have now gone five years without bringing in a new defender missing out . on the likes of Javi Martinez, Thiago Silva and most recently David . Luis along the way. But . Zubizarreta said: 'We are working to strengthen the centre of defence – . but so are 90 percent of Europe’s top clubs. David Luis has been the . only big movement in the market in this position so far but nothing else . has happened. We have to look for players who are better than the ones . we have.'

Real Madrid have agreed to pay Manchester United target Toni Kroos £160,000 a week to take him from Bayern Munich after the player favoured a move to Spain over linking up with his former boss. Louis van Gaal was Bayern Munich coach when Kroos was a young player returning from a successful loan period at Bayer Leverkusen, but the player was put out by the cold welcome he received when he returned to the Allianz Arena. Kroos always felt happier playing for Van Gaal’s successor Jupp Heynckes, who had also coached him during his loan spell at Leverkusen. On strike: Toni Kroos (right), shooting past USA's Jermaine Jones, is set for a move to Real Madrid . Battle: The Germany and Bayern Munich star is one of Manchester United's top targets . The 24-year-old has agreed a five-year deal with the European Cup holders and now Madrid need to close the deal with Bayern who have allowed his contract to run down to its final year and will accept around £20million for the German international. Many fans of the the German champions are bemused the club have allowed the midfielder who made his debut at just 17 to slip away, arguing that he is a better player than Mario Gotze - who they spent £30million on last year snatching him from Borussia Dortmund.

But former Manchester United striker Diego Forlan says he is in perfect shape to stand in if necessary. 'Everything is on course, exactly as we anticipated,' said Pan. Fighting fit: Luis Suarez is making good progress to be ready to face England, says Uruguay doctor Alberto Pan . Injury: Suarez (centre) had an operation on his knee but has been included in Uruguay's World Cup squad . 'He is doing muscle strengthening exercises and feeling no pain.' Suarez spent his first full day at Uruguay’s World Cup training camp Complejo Celeste in Montevideo on Monday where Pan assessed him.

'Until now, all is going according to plan and he will step up the training successively. That will decide when he returns to the team. 'We are confident and we are moving the right way.'
