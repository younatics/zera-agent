"Washington (CNN) -- It took five days for President Barack Obama to address the controversy he caused by saying ""we don't have a strategy yet"" to defeat ISIS. Wednesday, the President attempted to clarify what he meant by specifying that he was referring to ISIS inside Syria while highlighting the U.S. strategy in Iraq of airstrikes to weaken the extremist terror group that calls itself the Islamic State. ""It is very important from my perspective that when we send our pilots in to do a job -- that we know that this is a mission that's going to work; that we're very clear what our objectives are, what our targets are,"" Obama said during a joint news conference with Estonian Prime Minister Taavi Roivas on the first day of his trip to Europe for NATO meetings. Obama went further, saying that before the U.S. acts in Syria, the administration must have ""made the case to the American people and (make sure) we've got allies behind us so that it's not just a one-off, but it's something that over time is going to be effective."" In other words, the President wants to engage coalition partners, create a meaningful military plan and explain it to the public. He also said he might need approval from Congress. Who is ISIS? So why did that take so long to respond to that rare moment of candor that resulted in ongoing criticism from every corner of the political spectrum and provide another opportunity for critics to define his foreign policy as feckless and aimless? Dr. Nussaibah Younis, senior researcher at the Project on Middle East Democracy, said Obama's slow response to his critics is characteristic of his approach to foreign policy. ""Slowly he's getting there,"" said Younis, an Iraq expert who has been warning about the growing threat of ISIS and is critical of the President's ""cautious"" approach to ISIS in Iraq. He wants strategic, limited and immediate airstrikes in Syria. ""The gravity of the situation is filtering through and I think that's progress."" Biden: U.S. to pursue ISIS killers 'to the gates of hell' The President again fell victim to that perception again Wednesday. During that same news conference in Estonia, Obama gave mixed messages of U.S. goals against the group that effectively erased the border between Iraq and Syria. On one hand he said the goal is to ""degrade and destroy,"" then appeared to move back from the ""destroy"" part of the phrase by saying the goal against ISIS is to ensure the group is ""manageable."" It is another instance that opens him up to criticism from those who want aggressive military action as well as confusion on the part of an American public that wants answers. ""He left a little ambiguous what the goal is today,"" David Gergen, a former adviser to four presidents, said Wednesday on CNN. An administration official defended the President, saying he did not deliver two conflicting messages, but noted that this is going to be a time-consuming fight that will begin with managing ISIS's threat and eventually lead to its destruction. Now that this is the second messaging problem the President has had in less than a week when talking about the terrorist group, Major Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said the President's missives must be more clear. ""Words are very, very important,"" Marks said on CNN, adding that his messages are mixed because the U.S.'s lack of a strategy. Regardless of messaging, the President's restrained strategy does have its defenders. Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's ""GPS,"" said that the President's response to ISIS in Syria, which is embroiled in a three-year long civil war, is appropriate. He said one important consideration is whether the brutal regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would be strengthened if ISIS is defeated there. ""In the Middle East, the enemy of your enemy is still your enemy,"" Zakaria said on CNN's ""New Day"" on Wednesday. The external pressure put on Obama to act is harmful, Zakaria said. ""This is where the media pressure actually is unhelpful to having a strong foreign policy,"" he said. After ISIS beheaded American journalist Steve Sotloff, the second American in less than one month, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman wrote that caution is the President's ally because ISIS's actions are ""meant to get us to overreact."" The President will begin to mold his strategy at the NATO summit where he will attempt to organize a coalition to address ISIS in Syria. And next week, Congress is back in Washington where debate about U.S. response to ISIS is expected. Opinion: Why Obama needs to be the explainer in chief .

"Silverstone, England (CNN) -- It was a red letter day for Formula One driver Jules Bianchi at Silverstone this week. The Frenchman donned Ferrari's famous scarlet uniform as he was chosen to deputize for the injured Kimi Raikkonen on the final day of in-season testing. Bianchi, who drives for the back-of-the-grid Marussia team, told CNN he received a phone call on Monday evening asking him to stand in for the Finn, who is recuperating from a bruising crash in Sunday's British Grand Prix. His big chance was widely seen as an audition for a future Ferrari drive -- perhaps as soon as 2016. The 24-year-old did not fluff his lines in Wednesday's session, setting the fastest time and clocking up 89 laps. ""I was consistent and doing good lap time,"" Bianchi said after stepping out the Ferrari F14 T racer. ""I think I showed the team I can work well and I can be quick, but it was a day of testing so it was not the target to compare me with other drivers. ""It was just the target to improve the car and to help the team, so I think I've done my job with that and I'm really happy."" It is not the first time that Bianchi, who has been under the wing of the Ferrari Academy since 2010, has driven in a test for the Italian marque. But despite a reluctance to talk up his Silverstone outing, the call-up seemed to have extra significance because he was chosen to replace Raikkonen, who said after his crash he still wanted to fulfill his testing duties. Fernando Alonso, the team's de facto No. 1, was also not brought back to England to help with the crucial final test of the 2014 season. ""If one day they want me I will be ready,"" Bianchi said when asked if he was hopeful his testing performance would lead to promotion to a Ferrari seat. ""Considering that I'm part of the academy it's the target one day, so I have to show them. ""We'll see because at the moment they have two drivers and they are doing a good job so I don't think it's the plan. ""For the moment I will just focus on what I have do which is with Marussia. I think it's really important to keep going like this. ""It's never easy to stay in Formula One but I hope I show enough to Ferrari that I deserve to stay so they can help me."" Bianchi has impressed since making his debut last season with Marussia, which uses Ferrari engines. At the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix he claimed his first career points -- and the first for the team since it started out as Manor Racing in 2010 -- by finishing ninth. While Bianchi continues to work towards a future at Ferrari, Alonso and Raikkonen are both out of contract at the end of 2015. Ferrari is the only team to boast a lineup of two world champions but the experienced pairing has struggled to deliver results. It has been another difficult season for the once-dominant force in F1. Ferrari president Luca Di Montzemolo went so far as to call it ""painful."" The Ferrari engine has not matched the might of Mercedes -- which leads both the driver and constructor championships -- and team principal Stefano Domenicali resigned three races into the season, triggering structural changes within the organization. Alonso has continued to battle on track, claiming the team's only podium with third in China, but there are question marks over Raikkonen's performance and motivation since he joined from Lotus. The team's 2007 champion has out-qualified Alonso twice but has been beaten by the Spanish double world champion in every grand prix so far. If Bianchi represents the future, it is no wonder Ferrari is already looking ahead.","Jules Bianchi given run by Ferrari at testing session in Britain .

"(CNN) -- Chris Hoy became Great Britain's most decorated Olympian of all time after his victory in the men's keirin took his tally to six gold medals. Hoy fought off a late charge from Germany's Maximilian Levy in the final sprint to cross the line first and then confirmed he is ""99.9%"" certain never to race in the Olympics again. The 36-year-old was roared home by a vociferous crowd in the Velodrome to complete a dream Games for Team GB who won seven of the 10 track cycling gold medals on offer. Earlier in the day Laura Trott added to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event, but home crowd favorite Victoria Pendleton was beaten to gold by Australian Anna Meares in the individual sprint. Follow the action on day eleven with our London 2012 live blog . ""I'm in shock, you try and compose yourself but it's surreal,"" Hoy told the host broadcaster after the race. ""I wanted to win gold in front of my home crowd. I saw everyone stepping up to the plate and thankfully it worked out for me too. ""The keirin is a lottery and you never take anything for granted in it. I can't describe the feelings I have at the moment. This is enough for me, this is the perfect end to my Olympic career. ""I can't put into words what it means to me. It's one of the greatest feelings I have ever had. I'm 99.9% sure I won't be competing in Rio -- how can you top this? ""Glasgow (for the 2014 Commonwealth Games) is another question, as that would be the dream ending for me."" Hoy took the lead with two laps to go and though Levy briefly overtook him on the back straight, the Scot responded to power ahead and take the line. He has now eclipsed the five gold medals won by rower Steve Redgrave to become Britain's most successful ever Olympian. Behind Hoy and Levy, New Zealand's Simon Van Velthooven and Dutchman Teun Mulder could not be split by a photo finish and were both awarded bronze medals. In the women's individual sprint final Meares gained revenge for defeat in the same event four years ago, as Pendleton had to settle for silver in her last race before retiring. But though the Australian won the best of three final 2-0, it was a race tinged with controversy. Pendleton thought she had won the first leg by 0.001 of a second, only to be disqualified by the judges for straying out of the sprint lane. Her coaches argued Meares had nudged into her, forcing the mistake but the decision stood. She was also disqualified from the women's team sprint on Thursday. In the second sprint Pendleton went off early but ran out of power as Meares surged past her to add another gold to the one she won in Athens. It denied Pendleton a fairytale ending to a career in which she won two gold medals, including the women's keirin at the London Games. ""I'm so relieved and overwhelmed with emotion. I would have loved to have won on my final race but I'm so glad it's all done and I can move on,"" she said. ""I think Anna is the best rider of the field and it is the way it should have been, Anna and myself in the final, she's a fantastic competitor. But I'm very glad to be saying that's the last time I'm going to go through that. ""I was really annoyed (at being relegated) because I'm sure she touched me and it caused me to move up. I can't believe twice in the competition I've been disqualified and relegated, it's unheard of."" Prior to Pendleton's farewell race, 20-year-old Laura Trott secured her second gold in her first ever Olympics by winning the multi-discipline women's omnium event. She set a new Olympic record in the the 500m time trial event to beat American Sarah Hammer and add to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit. ""I can't believe this has happened to me,"" she said. ""I'm peaking at the right time and it's all thanks to the coaches, and the support of the crowd and my family.""","Chris Hoy becomes Britain's most decorated Olympian after winning sixth gold .

"(CNN) -- Teenage boys at a Tennessee detention center challenged the authorities there once again, kicking through aluminum panels in their rooms to escape their quarters. The 24 youths broke out of their rooms late Wednesday into early Thursday, but did not escape from the facility, Tennessee's Department of Children's Services said. On Monday, 32 teen boys escaped from the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center on the outskirts of Nashville. Most have turned themselves in or been captured, but six remain at large. In Thursday's disturbance, the boys broke out of their rooms the same way they did Monday, by kicking through aluminum panels installed below their windows, the children's services agency said in a statement. Police and highway patrol officers made a ring around the facility to prevent an escape. Officers from the state's department of corrections handcuffed the 24 youths who left their rooms. Ten of them were identified as leaders of the disturbance and were taken a juvenile detention facility, children's services said. The other 14 boys were brought back inside the facility, where extra guards were put in place. The detention center has faced similar problems in the past with the boys it houses. In May, some teens broke out of a window inside their dorm room, and then flipped a switch to let others out, according to CNN affiliate WSMV. No one escaped the facility that night, but new security measures were put into place. After the latest incident, the commissioner for children's services, Jim Henry, said there are rules in place that restrict guards' ability to manage the teens. He wants these rules, such as one that keeps the teens' doors unlocked, to be rethought, he said.","24 teen boys escaped from their dorms at a detention center near Nashville .

"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers has been moved out of the intensive care unit and into a private hospital room, her daughter said Wednesday. Melissa Rivers, who confirmed Tuesday that her mother was on life support, did not indicate if the change was the result of an improved medical condition six days after she suffered respiratory and cardiac arrest during a medical procedure. ""My mother has been moved out of intensive care and into a private room where she is being kept comfortable,"" she said. ""Thank you for your continued support."" It is not clear if Rivers is still on life support, which ""replaces or supports a failing bodily function,"" according to an explanation from the Cleveland Clinic. ""When patients have curable or treatable conditions, life support is used temporarily until the illness or disease can be stabilized and the body can resume normal functioning,"" the Cleveland Clinic website said. ""At times, the body never regains the ability to function without life support."" Rivers has shared few details with the public about her mother's condition since she was rushed to Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital August 28. A statement Sunday that the family was ""keeping our fingers crossed."" Rivers, 81, stopped breathing during throat surgery at a Manhattan medical clinic last week, according to the New York Fire Department. She apparently suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during a procedure. She was listed in critical condition in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, where paramedics took her by ambulance. Rivers was undergoing an apparently minor elective procedure at the clinic, which is about a mile away from the hospital where she was taken.

"(CNN) -- Babylon was one of the glories of the ancient world, its walls and mythic hanging gardens listed among the Seven Wonders. Founded about 4,000 years ago, the ancient city was the capital of 10 dynasties in Mesopotamia, considered one of the earliest cradles of civilization and the birthplace of writing and literature. But following years of plunder, neglect and conflict, the Babylon of today scarcely conjures that illustrious history. In recent years, the Iraqi authorities have reopened Babylon to tourists, hoping that one day the site will draw visitors from all over the globe. But despite the site's remarkable archaeological value and impressive views, it is drawing only a smattering of tourists, drawn by a curious mix of ancient and more recent history. The city -- just 85km (52 miles) south of Baghdad, about a two hour drive, dependent on checkpoints -- still bears the marks of ham-fisted attempts at restoration by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, and a subsequent occupation by U.S. forces in 2003. ""They occupied Babylon. They wouldn't let anyone in,"" says Hussein Saheb, a guard at the historical sites at Babylon, recalling the day U.S. tanks rolled into view, before forces set up camp. Read more: Is a man-made desert lake an ecological paradise or disaster? Following excavations in the early 20th century, European archaeologists claimed key features such as the remains of the famous Ishtar Gate -- the glazed brick gate decorated with images of dragons and aurochs, built in about 575 BC by order of King Nebuchadnezzar II as the eighth gate to the inner city. The original now stands as part of a reconstruction of the gate in Berlin's Pergamon Museum, whereas in Babylon itself, visitors enter through a replica. Yet remnants of Babylon's former glory remain, with sections of the city's walls still intact. Later excavations and conservation work carried out under Saddam's rule greatly despoiled the site, say archaeologists. Iraqi archaeologist Hai Katth Moussa said that during a massive reconstruction project in the early 1980s, Saddam began building a replica of the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II on top of the ruins of the ancient palace. Like Nebuchadnezzar, he wrote his name on many of the bricks, with inscriptions such as: ""This was built by Saddam, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glorify Iraq."" After the Gulf War, Saddam began building a modern palace for himself on top of ruins in the style of a Sumerian ziggurat. When U.S. forces arrived in 2003, they occupied the palace, which lies adjacent to Nebuchadnezzar's palace and overlooks the Euphrates River, and left their own mark. Today, a basketball hoop remains in Babylon, while concertina wire left behind by the military is used to prevent visitors from climbing over a 2,500-year-old lion statue -- an ancient symbol of the city. Read more: A camel beauty pageant in the UAE . Even in the new Iraq, Babylon faces ongoing threats. Only 2% of the ancient city has been excavated, but those buried historical treasures are threatened by encroaching development. Tour guide Hussein Al-Ammari says an oil pipeline runs through the eastern part of the ancient city. ""It goes through the outer wall of Babylon,"" he says. Yet despite the shortcomings in its preservation, Babylon holds a draw for small numbers of Iraqi visitors -- even if only to enter Saddam's marble-lined palaces, still a novelty 10 years after the dictator's downfall. Zained Mohammed, visiting with her family for the first time from Karbala, told CNN: ""We were just looking for a change of atmosphere, to have the kids see something different."" Babylon is certainly that.","In recent years, the Iraqi authorities have reopened Babylon to tourists .

"(CNN) -- U.N.-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan is promoting a six-point initiative to end the violence, bring in relief, and forge a political process to address grievances in Syria. The U.N. Security Council endorsed a presidential statement last week welcoming Annan's recent appointment as a special envoy on the crisis. It also backed the six-point plan submitted to Syria, which Annan's office said was accepted by President Bashar al-Assad's regime. ""The Security Council calls upon the Syrian government and opposition to work in good faith with the envoy towards a peaceful settlement of the Syrian crisis and to implement fully and immediately his initial six-point proposal,"" the presidential statement said. The six-point initiative is laid out in the statement. A couple of points directly address the aggressive year-long government crackdown against protesters. The United Nations says it now estimates that more than 9,000 people have died in the Syrian conflict. Activists estimate more than 10,000 deaths. One point urges the government to ""respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully as legally guaranteed."" Read the U.N. statement (PDF) Another calls for Syrians to ""commit to stop the fighting and achieve urgently an effective United Nations supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians and stabilize the country."" The government, the plan says, should immediately stop ""troop movements towards, and end the use of heavy weapons (in),"" population centers. It also should pull back the concentrated military deployments in and around population centers, it says. ""As these actions are being taken on the ground, the Syrian government should work with the envoy to bring about a sustained cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties with an effective United Nations supervision mechanism,"" according to the plan. ""Similar commitments would be sought by the envoy from the opposition and all relevant elements to stop the fighting and work with him to bring about a sustained cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties with an effective United Nations supervision mechanism."" Throughout the year, many people have been arrested by the government and activists say those actions have been unfair. The plan urges the Syrian government to ""intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons, including especially vulnerable categories of persons, and persons involved in peaceful political activities."" The plan urges authorities to urgently provide ""a list of all places"" where people are detained. It says the government should organize ""access"" to those places. It should ""respond promptly to all written requests for information, access or release"" of those detainees. The fate of civilians caught in the crossfire of fighting and in the middle of military offensives has been a major concern. Another point in the plan calls for the government to ""ensure timely provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting."" It calls on the government ""to accept and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause"" to allow delivery of relief supplies. Despite the appearance of an armed resistance and some talk of arming them, world powers have emphasized the necessity of a peaceful settlement. Another point in the plan reflects this stance. It urges Syrian authorities to work with Annan ""in an inclusive Syrian-led political process to address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people."" They should ""commit to appoint an empowered interlocutor when invited to do so by the envoy."" The government has restricted the movement of journalists during the yearlong conflict and events reported by activists and the government cannot be independently confirmed. One of the points in the plan demands ensuring ""freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists and a non-discriminatory visa policy for them."" Annan viewed Syria's acceptance of the plan Tuesday as an ""important initial step."" Over the past year, the Assad regime has said it is committed to end the violence but it has continued the crackdown just the same. Annan has stressed that ""implementation of the plan is the key"" and the Assad regime needs ""to put its commitments into immediate effect.""","The plan calls for a Syrian-led political process .

"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's book roll-out the past few days has shown, as expected, that she still commands an army of rapturous fans, but the best news for her this week came from the completely unexpected: the defeat of Republican leader Eric Cantor. Rarely has a GOP primary for a seat in the House of Representatives had such wide repercussions. For Clinton, they almost all run in her favor. Consider just three: . (1) Prior to the Cantor defeat, the GOP ""establishment"" thought they were starting to persuade middle-of-the-road voters that their party is not hostage to the tea party. After all, GOP establishment candidates so far this year have won five of seven Senate primaries where they were challenged by tea party candidates, most notably Mitch McConnell's victory in Kentucky. A public narrative was emerging that tea partiers remained a potent and, yes, welcome force in the GOP but that they aren't in charge. The defeat of Cantor was a thunderclap transforming the landscape. Because Cantor is perceived as a strong conservative, and yet lost to an unknown on his right, the narrative has changed: Now the story line is that the GOP base is not only angry but demands even tougher conservatism and even less compromise. All this plays directly into Clinton's hands. If she formally declares, she can now stand before the electorate and assert with greater credibility that she -- not the GOP -- represents sensibility and moderation, a leader eager to work across the aisle. She even has greater latitude to embrace some of Elizabeth Warren's positions, appealing to the rise of a populist left, so long as she doesn't veer too far from the middle (where most voters still are). (2) Cantor's defeat all but extinguishes lingering hopes that Congress and President Obama can work out a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform. Two post-election polls have suggested that Cantor's perceived openness to immigration reform was not the decisive factor in his defeat, but his opponent certainly seized on immigration as a stick to beat him over the head as an out-of-touch, wrong-headed reform advocate. In the wake of his defeat, it's hard to see how other Republican incumbents will follow Cantor's path. And for starters, they will likely be very wary of voting for immigration reform until dust settles. That, of course, is bad news for the GOP presidential nominee in 2016 and good news for Clinton if she is the Democratic standard bearer. Mitt Romney could only garner 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012, far below the 40% that pundits think is mandatory for victory. Unless it finds a way out of the cul de sac, the GOP share could sink even lower this time. Opinion: Should Clinton embrace Obama's foreign policy? (3) We haven't yet heard from that corner, but one can only imagine that the Cantor defeat, tied so closely to charges that he was for ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants, is prompting second thoughts by Jeb Bush and his many admirers about whether 2016 is the right year for him to run. If Bush's deep belief in immigration reform would tear apart his party in the primaries and make his path to the White House perilous at best, why should he? If Jeb Bush decides not to go, that would be extremely welcome news to the Clinton camp. From the point of view of Democrats, the most obvious threat to a Clinton victory is a Republican governor conservative enough to unite his party but moderate and experienced enough to pull in purple states. Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are the two who come closest to that profile. Conservatives may disagree -- many genuinely believe that a Rand Paul can win -- but Democrats will quietly celebrate if neither Bush nor Christie tops the Republican ticket. It is an oddity of American democracy that a tiny number of voters -- fewer than 8,000 -- in a suburb of Richmond, Virginia, can substantially alter the national outlook. But we live in odd, unpredictable times. No doubt other big surprises lie ahead before November 2016.","Hillary Clinton gets a gift from the Republicans as she rolls out her book .

"(CNN) -- Two bodies found this week in Oklahoma are those of a murder suspect and his slain wife's missing 7-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday. The bodies have been identified as Lester William Hobbs, 46, and Aja Daniell Johnson, authorities said at a Wednesday news conference. The cause and manner of death are still under investigation. Authorities had been searching for Hobbs and the girl since late January, when Aja's mother, Tonya -- Hobbs' estranged wife -- was found dead inside an RV in Geronimo, Oklahoma. On January 26, two days after the body was found, Hobbs was charged with first-degree murder in the killing, and with kidnapping in Aja's disappearance, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. Authorities launched a manhunt for Hobbs, saying that he took the girl in a white 1992 Toyota Paseo. On Monday, the two bodies and the car were discovered in a heavily wooded area of Norman, which is outside Oklahoma City, said Jessica Brown, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation. The city is about 80 miles north of Geronimo. The car had been left in the woods for several weeks, possibly a month, Brown said. Cherokee Ballard, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma state medical examiner's office, said Wednesday that the office used fingerprints to identify Hobbs and dental records to identify Aja. Richard Goss, an agent with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, said authorities would be investigating whether anyone had harbored Hobbs. The girl's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with the girl and that she would keep the child away from Hobbs, the documents said.","Bodies of Aja Daniell Johnson, 7, and man suspected of killing her mother are identified .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A cousin of Afghan President Hamid Karzai died in a bombing Tuesday, a provincial spokesman said, marking the latest killing of a Karzai relative. Hashmat Khalil Karzai, an influential figure in southern Kandahar, died in the blast, Kandahar provincial spokesman Dawa Khan Minapal said. Minapal said a suicide bomber was among a group of people who were visiting Hashmat Karzai at his house for Eid al-Fitr celebrations when he detonated his explosives. Hashmat Karzai was a member of Kandahar provincial council and was a key campaigner and ally of presidential candidate Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai in the south of the country. The killing comes three years after the president's half brother was killed and 15 years after his father was killed. In 2011, half brother Ahmed Wali Karzai was shot to death in his home by a guard. Ahmed Wali Karzai was the Kandahar provincial council chief. A governor's spokesman said he was shot by a guard, who was subsequently shot dead by other guards. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying the guard was working for them. And in 1999, Hamid Karzai's father Abdul Ahad Karzai, a former senator in the Afghan parliament, was shot to death in Quetta, Pakistan. The family has blamed the Taliban for that assassination. Hamid Karzai is preparing to leave office after Afghanistan's presidential election, which took place earlier this year. But both presidential contenders allege large-scale voter fraud. The President condemned the attrack. ""Every day, Afghans are martyred by the terrorists in Afghanistan and my family is not exceptional from this calamity and we accept this sacrifice,' he said. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul; CNN's Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: President Karzai condemned the attack .

"(CNN) -- In a typical, unassuming classroom at Rosemount High School in the suburbs of Minneapolis, U.S. history teacher Josh Hoekstra had a very novel idea about how the subject is taught. The 39-year-old husband and father of three has been teaching U.S. history for 13 years. He's seen firsthand the demise of U.S. history education, now our high school seniors' worst subject. This school year, after watching his students' intense interest in college basketball's March Madness tournament (rather than school), Hoekstra invented his own teaching curriculum, called Teach With Tournaments, to transform U.S. history content into a similar competitive, student-driven tournament. ""There is no reason that teaching U.S. history in the 21st century cannot be an amazing experience for all involved,"" Hoekstra told me. ""Kids need to make a personal connection with the people they are studying. Kids who 'hate history' are the ones who never were exposed to the human side of the people they are studying."" The goal of Teach With Tournaments is simple -- immerse students in the personalities and character of the great men and women of history through competition. For this school year, the tournament focused on one theme: the most courageous figure in U.S. history. Each student chose a historical figure he or she thought best embodies courage in U.S. history, from military heroes such as Alvin York to civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks to humanitarian pioneers such as Clara Barton. Each choice was then paired off in the bracket system. Students were required to research their character's accomplishments and then defend their choice in front of the class. Afterward, the class voted and the winners moved on to the next round, eventually narrowing the field of 64 to one champion. The genius of Hoekstra's plan is that his students are required to use new arguments for each round. Like a good coach draws up a new game plan for each opponent, so too must students innovate and dive deeper into their research. It wasn't long before their competitive juices kicked in. In the first round of the brackets, Tom Burnett, one of the heroes of Flight 93 on September 11th, lost by the slimmest of votes to U.S. Navy SEAL and Medal of Honor recipient Michael Murphy. The girl who represented Tom Burnett was in tears over the outcome. ""This is a student who had become deeply connected to the person she was researching and was overcome with emotion. To see this type of passion from a 16-year-old girl in a public high school classroom is rewarding beyond words,"" Hoekstra said. Over the school year, the brackets whittled down to two final characters, the aforementioned Murphy and WWII hero and Medal of Honor recipient John Basilone. Before the final vote, Hoekstra asked his class for any last arguments. A student with special needs raised his hand and spoke on Murphy's behalf. He praised Murphy for sacrificing his life to save his team in Afghanistan, but he said what really makes Murphy his choice was that when Murphy was in 8th grade, he defended a special needs student who was being bullied. ""For this young man a personal connection was made beyond what was in the headlines,"" Hoekstra recounted. ""Everyone in that room, including myself, learned something because that one nervous student with a shaky voice was emotionally invested in the material."" One special needs student discovered what millions of our students are missing -- a deep, personal connection to American history. In the course of human history, the American story is great and unique, one filled with men and women of courage, character, and compassion. We must bring it to life for other students like Hoekstra did for his. His Teach With Tournaments innovation may very well be one of the tools. Already teachers across the country are using it, Hoekstra says, and it's replicable for any subject or any classroom. (I came to know Josh when he called into my radio show, Morning In America. He uses some of my books in his classroom.) Teachers like Hoekstra are a great influence on their students. Education expert Eric Hanushek estimates that the difference between a great teacher and bad teacher in a child's lifetime earnings is hundreds of thousands of dollars. But more important than paychecks, a great teacher instills in his students character and a passion for self-instruction. In one of Hoekstra's brackets, WWII hero Audie Murphy lost to Louis Zamperini, the brave prisoner of war survivor and subject of the book ""Unbroken."" The young man representing Murphy was heartbroken that he didn't win. Audie Murphy was more than just a war hero, this young man argued. At a young age, Murphy's father left him and his family, leaving Murphy to hunt for food and provide for his many siblings. At the same time, back at his home, this particular young man was watching his own father slowly succumb to cancer. He would soon be without a father and in a similar position as the young Audie Murphy. Like great teachers do, Hoekstra was preparing this boy for more than a history exam. He was preparing him for life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","A history teacher started using a ""March Madness"" style tournament to involve students .

"(CNN) -- Upon his arrival in Damascus, Syria, joint U.N.-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan called Monday for those responsible for Friday's massacre of 108 people in the town of Houla to be held responsible and for his six-point plan to be implemented. ""This was an appalling crime, and the Security Council has rightly condemned it,"" he said in a statement. ""Those responsible for these brutal crimes must be held accountable. I understand that the government is also investigating. It is the Syrian people, ordinary citizens of this great country, who are paying the highest price in this conflict. ""Our goal is to stop this suffering. It must end and it must end now."" Photos: Massacre in Syria (Warning: Graphic images) Annan demanded that the government of Bashar al-Assad ""take bold steps to signal that it is serious in its intention to resolve this crisis peacefully, and for everyone involved to help create the right context for a credible political process. And this message of peace is not only for the government, but for everyone with a gun."" He added, ""The six-point plan has to be implemented comprehensively. And this is not happening."" Annan said he plans to have ""serious and frank"" talks with al-Assad and others. He has met with the country's foreign minister, according to images broadcast on state TV. Annan: Syrian suffering 'must end and it must end now' But a rebel leader said Annan's six-point plan is already ""dead"" following the killings in Houla, a suburb of the anti-government bastion of Homs. U.N. monitors in Syria said 49 children were among the dead. Al-Assad's regime insists it was not behind the massacre and blames terrorist groups. Throughout the uprising against the government, Syria has blamed violence on ""armed terrorist groups."" Opposition leaders say the massacre is the latest in Syria's crackdown against protesters. Syrian U.N. representative Bashar al-Jaafari, who called the deaths ""an appalling, horrific unjustified and unjustifiable crime,"" insisted Monday that the Syrian government is working to find the people responsible. He called on the U.N. Security Council to ""convene to define those who arm, host, harbor and encourage the terrorist groups to continue their violence in Syria and bring them to justice,"" the state-run news agency SANA reported. Deaths continue amid diplomatic deadlock . Jaafari railed against ""member states"" of the Security Council who are helping the opposition. ""Those who are very interested in halting violence and making the comprehensive national dialogue in Syria a success should stop interfering in our internal affairs and should stop arming, hosting, funding and protecting the armed terrorist groups in my country,"" he said. British Foreign Secretary William Hague, who has expressed outrage about the massacre, was in Russia on Monday seeking to persuade Russian officials to pressure the Syrian regime to comply with Annan's peace plan. But after Hague met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, there was no clear sign that international action would ratchet up. ""It sounds very noble to say Russia is supporting the Syrian government, and when it stops supporting the Syrian government, everything will be fine,"" Lavrov told reporters. But in reality, he said, ""We do not support the Syrian government. We are supporting the Kofi Annan plan that addresses both the Syrian government and the armed opposition. ... We have to be objective."" U.N. condemns Syrian killings; toll in massacre rises as violence goes on . After Friday's massacre in Houla, rebel leaders once again implored the international community for airstrikes against regime forces. Meanwhile, residents of Houla were grieving as opposition activists and residents blamed al-Assad's regime for the bloodbath. ""By God, I washed the dead bodies of nine children. One was less than 9 months old!"" a man screamed to a U.N. observer. ""Why are they treating us like animals? We are humans. Did the infant carry an RPG? Was he a fighter? It was a baby, he had a pacifier in his mouth."" Al-Assad regime defined by violence . Images from Houla show a room crammed with the mangled and bloody bodies of children -- some with their skulls torn open. ""After the stuff we've seen, we can't feel anything. ... We're used to the sights now, the blood, the sound of gunfire,"" said another resident, who CNN is not naming because of safety concerns. Pro-government gangs have returned to Houla, where food, water and medicine are in short supply, he said. ""They only thing we have here is the Free (Syrian) Army. It's the only thing that can protect us after God,"" the resident said. The killings reignited international fury against al-Assad's regime for its 14-month crackdown on dissidents seeking an end to his rule. On Sunday, some U.N. Security Council members condemned the Houla attacks ""that involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood"" as well as the killings of civilians by gunshots fired at close-range. In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Israel supports the U.N. Security Council's condemnation of the atrocities in Syria. ""The pictures of the children's mutilated bodies are both shocking and disturbing,"" he told a group of visiting U.S. senators. ""We call upon the nations of the world to unite and act immediately to stop the ongoing massacre of innocents."" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said the United States was horrified by ""credible reports"" of the massacre, ""including stabbing and ax attacks on women and children."" Opinion: Only Russia and China can stop the carnage . And some called Syria's promise of an investigation a farce. ""There's no way a Syrian military commission can credibly investigate this horrendous crime when so much evidence suggests pro-government forces were responsible,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""Annan should insist that Syria grant access to the U.N. commission of inquiry to investigate this and other grave crimes."" Over the weekend, the rebel Free Syrian Army said the Annan plan was ""dead"" after the Houla massacre. ""The joint command of the FSA inside Syria announces that it is no longer possible to abide by the peace plan brokered by Kofi Annan, (which) the regime is taking advantage of in order to commit more massacres against our unarmed civilians,"" Free Syrian Army spokesman Col. Qasim Saad Eddine said in a video posted Saturday. ""This is a clear evidence that Kofi Annan's plan is dead and a clear indication that Bashar Assad and his criminal gang do not understand anything but the language of force and violence,"" Eddine said. He urged the U.N. Security Council to ""issue urgent and swift resolutions to save Syria, its people and the entire region by forming an international coalition mandated by the UNSC to launch airstrikes"" against regime forces and their strategic points. Violence continued Monday, with the Local Coordination Committees of Syria reporting 26 deaths. U.N. officials say more than 9,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed and tens of thousands more have been uprooted since the crisis began in March 2011. Opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people. CNN can confirm neither details from Syria nor the authenticity of videos, as the Syrian government limits access by foreign journalists.

"(CNN) -- Kofi Annan, whose initiative to forge peace in war-ravaged Syria failed to take hold, said he has resigned as the U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy because of ""increasing militarization on the ground"" and ""the clear lack of unity"" at the U.N. Security Council. Annan said he told U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby that he didn't want to renew his mandate when it expires August 31. Syria state-run TV said the nation ""expresses regret for the resignation,"" and Ban said he and el-Araby are looking for a successor to take on the ""crucial peacemaking effort."" In Geneva, Annan said he accepted the job despite its challenges, a task that some had dubbed ""Mission Impossible."" He said it was a ""sacred duty"" to bring about peace, end the killings and abuse of civilians, and set a course toward political change. ""The severity of the humanitarian costs of the conflict, and the exceptional threats posed by this crisis to international peace and security, justified the attempts to secure a peaceful transition to a political settlement, however daunting the challenge. The increasing militarization on the ground and the clear lack of unity in the Security Council have fundamentally changed the circumstances for the effective exercise of my role,"" he said. Obama authorized covert support for Syrian rebels, sources say . ""Yet the bloodshed continues, most of all because of the Syrian government's intransigence and continuing refusal to implement the six-point plan, and also because of the escalating military campaign of the opposition, all of which is compounded by the disunity of the international community. At a time when we need -- when the Syrian people desperately need action, there continues to be finger-pointing and name-calling in the Security Council."" The nearly 17-month-long Syrian crisis started when the regime brutally cracked down on peaceful protesters in March 2011 and morphed into a nationwide uprising. Among the five permanent members of the council, Russia and China have persistently disagreed with tough action against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad that is favored by the United States, Britain and France. The utter failure of world diplomacy and Syrian leaders to end the fighting has resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe. Opposition groups say that more than 20,000 people have died, thousands have been imprisoned by the regime and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes. U.S. boost humanitarian aid to Syria . The conflict is now internationally regarded as a civil war between an armed resistance movement and al-Assad's regime. ""Without serious, purposeful and united international pressure, including from the powers of the region, it is impossible for me, or anyone, to compel the Syrian government in the first place, and also the opposition, to take the steps necessary to begin a political process. You have to understand: As an envoy, I can't want peace more than the protagonists, more than the Security Council or the international community, for that matter,"" Annan said. The appointment of the former secretary-general in February was supported by world powers and the Syrian government. After he took the post, he helped formulate a six-point peace plan for Syria that included a cease-fire. The United Nations established the U.N. Supervision Mission in Syria to monitor the efforts to forge the plan. The plan called for establishing a cease-fire between al-Assad's government and the opposition, allowing humanitarian groups access to the population, releasing detainees and starting a political dialogue. It also called for government forces to withdraw from city centers. Despite an initial and small drop in violence after his plan was announced, fighting raged nonstop. The terrain became so dangerous in Syria that U.N. monitors had to suspend their observation missions. In an opinion piece published Thursday in the Financial Times, Annan said regional and international players have ""clear common interests"" in a ""managed political transition."" He said al-Assad ""must leave office."" Read more: From rocks to RPGs . Russia, China and Iran, friends of the Syrian regime, ""must take concerted efforts to persuade Syria's leadership to change course and embrace a political transition, realizing the current government has lost all legitimacy,"" he said. The United States, Britain, France, Turkey Saudi Arabia and Qatar must press ""the opposition to embrace a fully inclusive political process."" ""None of this is possible, however, without genuine compromise on all sides,"" he wrote. ""Syria can still be saved from the worst calamity. But this requires courage and leadership, most of all from the permanent members of the Security Council, including from Presidents Putin and Obama. Is ours an international community that will act in defense of the most vulnerable of our world, and make the necessary sacrifices to help? The coming weeks in Syria will tell."" The Annan initiative disappointed opposition groups. Rafif Jouejati, English-language spokeswoman for the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said Annan's replacement ""will be equally constrained by Assad's failure to adhere to any sort of plan, and the ongoing complicity of Russia, China and Iran in mass killings and exodus in Syria."" ""The Annan resignation was expected, since his plans have failed. While this may cause discomfort for the U.N. and prove that it was unable to provide a solution for the Syrian people, it means nothing to the Syrian people. The revolution will continue until we achieve our goals of freedom, democracy and dignity. ""It is sad to watch the diplomatic process die in such indignity, but millions of Syrians had indicated that Assad had no intention of implementing any diplomatic or political solution to the current crisis in Syria,"" she said. ""Annan's plan was fatally flawed for several reasons, chief among them that 300 unarmed observers under the near-constant supervision of regime monitors could not possibly have been effective in observing, enforcing or even reporting on a cease-fire, let alone the other tenets of the Annan Plan."" Read more: Syrian regime failed to protect civilians . Vitaly Churkin, Russian ambassador to the United Nations, said he hopes Annan uses the rest of the time on the job to be as effective as possible ""under these very difficult circumstances."" ""We understand that it is his decision. We regret that he chose to do so. We have supported very strongly Kofi Annan's efforts,"" he said. ""I'm very encouraged that the secretary-general is already working on finding a successor for Kofi Annan who would be able to pick up this daunting task of putting an end to the crisis in Syria."" Ambassador Susan Rice, the United States' permanent representative to the United Nations, said Annan took on a ""thankless and difficult task at great personal cost."" ""When the Security Council failed to heed Mr. Annan's repeated calls for collective and significant consequences for non-compliance with its prior resolutions, those members who blocked this action effectively made Mr. Annan's mission impossible,"" she said in a written statement. Catherine Ashton, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said Annan's resignation ""makes clear how unfortunate it has been that the U.N. Security Council was unable to agree to a resolution."" ""The EU continues to support the efforts of the U.N. and the League of Arab States and calls for the early appointment of a successor to carry on Mr. Annan's work towards a peaceful political transition in Syria,"" Ashton said in a written statement. Ban, who was first to announce the move, praised Annan's ""determined and courageous efforts"" and said the news left him with ""deep regret."" He said that Annan worked within the mandate provided to him by the U.N. General Assembly and that he is ""indebted to him and his team for all they have tried to achieve."" But Ban also said the government and the opposition have been determined ""to rely on ever-increasing violence,"" and there have been ""persistent divisions within the (U.N.) Security Council."" ""Kofi Annan deserves our profound admiration for the selfless way in which he has put his formidable skills and prestige to this most difficult and potentially thankless of assignments,"" Ban said. Annan had been secretary-general from 1996 to 2006 and was involved in other initiatives, including the mediation of the election dispute a few years ago in Kenya. Ban said peace can come only if there's a ""firm commitment to dialogue"" among the players in Syria and international unity. ""Tragically, the spiral of violence in Syria is continuing. The hand extended to turn away from violence in favor of dialogue and diplomacy -- as spelled out in the six-point plan -- has not been taken, even though it still remains the best hope for the people of Syria.""

"(CNN) -- Every year, millions of tons of milk deemed unsafe for human consumption are discarded in Europe. Now, a German company is turning the spilled milk into high-end fashion. Anke Domaske, a biochemist turned fashion designer, is the inventor of QMilch -- a fabric made entirely of milk. ""Milk fabric has been around since the 1930s, but the process involved chemicals. QMilch doesn't, and it uses up fewer resources than natural fibers do,"" said Domaske, whose fashion label Mademoiselle Chi Chi is a favorite with stars including Mischa Barton and Ashlee Simpson. The fabric is created from milk which is allowed to ferment before it is turned into a powder. It is then heated and mixed with other natural ingredients and turned into yarn. ""To make one kilo of cotton takes 20,000 liters of water...our process only uses two liters of water,"" said the 29-year-old entrepreneur, who hopes her environmentally friendly fabric will revolutionize the fashion industry. The fabric might use less water than cotton but it is far more expensive to produce -- QMilch costs around $30 per kilo to produce, compared to $3.8 per kilo for cotton yarn. QMilch has a similar feel to silk, and is marketed as a luxury fiber. But, unlike other labor intensive materials like silk -- whose commodity prices fluctuate depending on the markets and the weather -- the cost of QMilch is expected to be stable, which Domaske said is feeding into its popularity. ""We are just ordering machines for producing 1,000 tons per year,"" she said. ""It is scaling up from producing two kilos per hour to 120 kilos per hour,"" she added. The fabric, which Domaske said is non-allergenic, is attracting interest outside of fashion. Makers of hospital and hotel bedding, and even car upholstery firms, are keen to clad their products in the sustainable fabric formerly known as milk.","Every year, millions of tons of milk deemed unsafe for human consumption are discarded .

"(Tokyo, Japan) (CNN) -- A Korean TV show about an alien who arrived on Earth 400 years ago and falls in love with a modern actress becomes one of the top series watched in Hebrew and Arabic. A Thai drama about a sharp-tongued woman who ends up being the maid of a Hong Kong mafia member strikes a chord with Spanish speakers. Viki, a site where dramas, telenovelas, comedies and movies from the globe are translated by fans, gives a glimpse into the cross section of the world's entertainment interests. It's where its 22 million monthly users find TV shows that have never made it on their local television sets. Described as the Hulu for the rest of the world, Viki has seen unexpected trends on the site: Turkish dramas perform well in Croatia. And Viki's largest market for South Korean movies is Saudi Arabia. Southeast Asian viewers love ""Battlestar Galactica."" Colombian telenovelas are a big hit in the Philippines. ""Really good story lines are universal,"" said Viki's CEO, Razmig Hovaghimian. ""There's a reason why Colombian drama travels well to the Philippines."" ""When it travels, it travels with its nuances, its culture and its beauty. I think it creates a wave that's really good for the content owner and it's really good for the culture it comes with."" Crowdsourcing the world's entertainment . The most popular shows on Viki -- many of which are Korean because of more flexible licensing agreements -- have been translated into nearly 70 languages including Cherokee and Greenlandic. The translations are crowdsourced by fans, who devote hours of their brainpower to make shows accessible in different languages. Of nearly 200 language subtitles that appear on the site, about 50 of them are vulnerable, endangered or severely-endangered languages, says Hovaghimian. The translators do not get paid. It's not about money says Nathalia Vela, one of Viki's translators who lives in Colombia. ""I get to practice my languages, learn others and experience other cultures while working with people around the world. ""I really enjoy so much subtitling and knowing that someone will be very happy because their favorite drama is subbed, so that is enough."" Vela estimates she has subtitled nearly 52 hours of content on Viki, usually between English and Spanish. Her favorite shows include ""Master's Sun,"" a Korean drama about a woman who develops the ability to see ghosts after emerging from a three-year coma and ""Nodame Cantabile"" a Japanese drama about two students who meet at a demanding music college. Each series has a designated channel manager like Vela, who is in charge of making sure that the community-submitted subtitles are accurate. After the quality check, the subtitles are locked. Vela says she's been inspired her to take classes in Japanese and French, and she's also learning Korean on Rosetta Stone in Colombia. ""The treasured thing we learned from Viki is that we saw a world where it is run not by money, but run by passion,"" said Viki's co-founder Jiwon Moon. Challenging the language barrier . The Singapore-based Viki, gets its name from the words video and wiki. In 2008, Moon, her husband, Changseong Ho, and Hovaghimian were business school students at Harvard and Stanford when they mulled over language learning challenges. Hovaghimian, who is of Armenian descent, grew up in Egypt watching shows and movies he couldn't understand. ""I was spending Saturdays with my dad, watching Bollywood movies in Egypt and Oshin (morning drama series) from Japan. We wouldn't understand what they were saying,"" he said. The business students wanted to build a way to subtitle content and get shows, film and content to travel beyond the native country. ""There is unmet need for such content distribution,"" Moon said. For years, U.S. movies and TV shows would air in other countries, but it was rare to see for example, a Japanese show in South Africa. And exposure to foreign shows and movies on U.S. stations or cinemas were also limited. ""The diversity of content exposed to U.S. audience is very limited,"" said Ho, who is Korean. ""We believed Korean and foreign content may work -- even for mainstream Americans."" They sought to license content from other countries and use crowd sourced translations to help them spread into different languages. ""Fan subbing has been around a long time,"" Hovaghimian said. ""The way it was done was not really legal or legit."" Viki struck its first content deal on a 2008 Korean show called ""Boys Over Flowers"" about four over-privileged boys at an elite school and a delivery girl who changes their lives. ""That was the right show to start at the right time,"" Hovaghimian said. ""We got worldwide rights for it. And at that point, we knew it was working."" That show has now been translated into 69 languages on Viki such as Magyar, Esperanto and Hmong. Viki had to convince broadcasters that fan-powered subtitles could be trusted and also that there were new foreign markets hungry for their content. ""If we tell people that there are a million people in Egypt that watch a certain anime, they can take that and sell that to a broadcaster or they can try to sell DVDs there,"" Hovaghimian said. They also realized that subtitling on Viki was happening so quickly that they were faster than pirates. ""We realized there is a 72-hour window that if you don't have translations on the content, typically pirate sites create translations,"" he said. ""If we get the translations within 72 hours, we're getting SEO traffic so it was eating into piracy."" Moon and Ho left the company in 2012 to start another company, Vingle. Rakuten, a Japanese company, purchased Viki in 2013. What translates . Viki's most watched show is a Korean drama called ""Playful Kiss,"" a show that bombed when it aired in South Korea in 2010. The show was translated into 40 languages within a few hours of its release on Viki that year. ""If we only licensed popular shows, that would've been a miss,"" Hovaghimian said. ""'Playful Kiss' is our No. 1 show -- something that bombed in the home country. But we listen to the fans, so fans create the channels and they make the requests."" When a certain number of fans request the shows, Viki looks into acquiring rights. The site allows users to watch the shows for free -- bearing in mind they have to endure the commercial breaks or pay a monthly fee to skip the ads. It also distributes the most popular shows with the fan-powered subtitles to Netflix and Hulu in Portuguese and Spanish. Fans on the site can add real-time comments that pops up throughout the show. Hovagmian observed that shows have soared cross-culturally in unexpected places. ""There's something that's resonating,"" he said.","Singapore-based Viki provides TV series and films from around the world .

"(CNN) -- South Sudan announced Friday it was withdrawing its troops from a contested oil-rich area it seized last week in a move that escalated tensions and fears of a return to war with Sudan. ""An orderly withdrawal will commence immediately and shall be completed within three days,"" said Barnaba Marial Benjamin, South Sudan's information minister, adding that his country still claims Panthou, or Heglig as it is known in Sudan. However, Sudan's government said its forces drove out the invaders from the south. ""The armed forces have liberated Heglig town from South Sudanese troops and mercenaries,"" Defense MInister Abdel Raheem Muhammad Hussein declared Friday on state-run television. In New York, Sudan's U.N. ambassador said the South Sudan troops were ""forced to withdraw."" ""They were chased out,"" Ambassador Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman told reporters. ""If you remember a few days back, the president of the South and a number of their officials started to talk about conditional withdrawal, but yesterday they are being cornered, we fought against them and we chased them out. It is not a withdrawal. We chased them out."" The disputed region is on the border between the two countries created last year when South Sudan split from Sudan. Benjamin said South Sudan sent troops into the area on April 10 because Sudan was using it to launch ground and aerial attacks across the border. ""The Republic of South Sudan calls on Sudan to immediately desist from air bombardments and ground incursions into the territory of the Republic of South Sudan,"" he told reporters in Juba, the South Sudan capital. Sudan claims Heglig's oil fields, which account for about half of the nation's oil production, and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir had vowed to ""never give up"" the disputed region. ""And we have said it before, whoever extends his hand toward Sudan, we will cut it off,"" Bashir said Thursday. ""If they do not understand, we will make them get it by force."" Sudanese warplanes have struck targets in South Sudan's border state of Unity during the past week, including an attack on Mayom town, where the United Nations said eight civilians were killed and 22 injured. One bomb hit a U.N. camp, but no one was hurt. Sudan's military spokesman, Philip Aguer, said Friday that Sudan had bombed a central processing facility in the Heglig oil fields. ""Khartoum bombed the CPF yesterday at 5:30 and that facility is still burning,"" he said. The facility is key to pumping oil out of the fields, which accounted for close to half of Sudan's entire production of about 115,000 barrels of oil per day before wells were shut down due to the conflict. South Sudan's seizure of the region and the resulting border clashes and threats raised fear in the international community of renewed full-scale war. The two sides fought a civil war for two decades that led to about 2 million deaths. ""The last thing the people of these two countries need is another war -- a war that could claim countless lives, destroy hope and ruin the prospects of peace and stability and prosperity of all Sudanese people,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. South Sudan split from the government in the north in July, officially breaking Africa's largest nation into two as the result of a referendum last year overwhelmingly approved by voters. The referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended the civil war that pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in the north against black Christians and animists in the south. Tensions run deep between the two nations, which have outstanding issues after their divorce last year. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. The two countries have been locked in negotiations about how much the landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north. Other outstanding issues remain since secession, including the status of citizens of both countries who find themselves living on either side of the world's newest international border. The fate of disputed border areas are also a point of contention. Britain's ambassador to South Sudan, Alastair McPhail, urged both countries to return to the negotiating table. ""We hope the withdrawal will be orderly and that both sides will refrain from further military action,"" he told reporters in Juba. South Sudan's Benjamin also called for ""a more robust international engagement"" in the negotiating process. In New York, Osman said the Khartoum government was ready for ""negotiations, peaceful settlements, provided that they come to their senses, sense of logic and sit down to negotiate without putting any conditions."" Osman also accused the leaders of South Sudan of continuing to act like guerrilla fighters instead of a new government. ""It is high time for the Security Council and the international community to send also a strong message for the government of the South to disassociate itself from the rebel factions and to stop destabilizing"" Sudan and the region, he said. China, which has invested heavily in Sudan's oil industry, has argued for calm and respect for each other's sovereignty, while Princeton Lyman, the U.S. special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan, visited both countries recently to meet government officials. There is ""an enormous amount of very emotional, very powerful rhetoric coming from here in Khartoum raising the stakes in many ways and that's worrisome in and of itself,"" Lyman said Thursday. But he said that based on the discussions he'd had with both sides, it was clear they did not want to return to war. As long-simmering tensions soar, rights group are warning of deteriorating humanitarian conditions. ""The deteriorating situation right now is making the overall humanitarian issues very challenging,"" said Alex Neve, secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada. Neve, who is in Juba, said supply lines at refugee camps have been cut off and failure to get key supplies before the rains will lead to a humanitarian crisis.

"Zango Town, Liberia (CNN) -- At the gravesite in a northern Liberia village, there are no religious or traditional burial rites. No ceremony, no mourning, no family members, and no final goodbyes. Nothing but a group of men dressed in space-suit-like outfits, cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave, they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased. These men are part of the country's Ebola response team, specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus. The virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with Ebola, and it is still transferable even from a dead body. To help combat the spread of the disease, the Liberian government has directed that its citizens should not bury anyone who dies of, or is suspected of having been infected with, Ebola. For months Liberians ignored the directive, fearing that they would be ostracized by their communities if they admitted that their relatives had died of Ebola, but here in Lofa County -- ground zero of the country's outbreak -- almost everyone has witnessed the devastating suffering and numerous deaths caused by the virus. Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community, they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely. Safe burials . ""When it started, it wasn't that easy,"" says Alpha Tamba, an Ebola response coordinator in Lofa County. ""It was kind of difficult for communities to disclose death. People preferred driving us away."" ""We must be grateful for the communities, through the efforts of the local leaders. Now they are disclosing death to us,"" he explains. Today, the team has been called to a village where a woman has died of unknown causes. It may not have been from the deadly virus, but the villagers are not taking any chances. The Lofa County health team arrives carrying gloves, gowns, goggles and diluted bleach. They suit up: from head to toe, no skin is exposed. On their hands they wear three layers of gloves, securing the edges with clear tape at the wrists. Before they enter the house to collect the body, one of them goes in and sprays the house with bleach. Then -- and only then -- can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag, ready for burial. Wailing rents the air as the burial team walks out of the house carrying the body on a stretcher. Some of those crying are the dead woman's family members; for their own safety, they can only mourn from a distance. Town abandoned . A few kilometres away from the village is Zango Town: most of the houses here have been abandoned, their doors padlocked and windows shuttered. Some of the residents abandoned the town in such a hurry that their clothes and floor mats have been left hanging on clotheslines. Kazalee Johnson, a community worker, tells CNN the empty houses belong to people who either died of Ebola or those who fled in terror, for fear of contracting the virus. Johnson says he lost his 8-months-pregnant sister, his brother, niece and many, many others: too many to name. ""They died. They died,"" he says. ""So many people die -- the houses on your right and even the houses on your left. They are all gone,"" says Johnson. It's hard to imagine another area in Lofa county that has been harder hit than this one. But then there's Barkedu Town -- of the 1,000 or so Ebola-related deaths in Liberia, 20% of the victims have died in this single town. Quarantine zone . Home to more than 8,000 people, Barkedu is now under quarantine: no one can go in, and no one can go out. The toll of the isolation is weighing heavily on the community. ""From the time we started receiving death from Ebola -- every activity cease,"" says Musa Sessay, the town's chief. ""Because we do farm here and now there's been no farming."" ""We need food, we really need medicine. But the most important one is medicine because the hospital is closed down, there is no health worker,"" he says. This is what life is like across Lofa: The people are locked in, afraid and alone. And not even the health workers are spared the ravaging effects of Ebola. Sometimes when they are called in to investigate a case, they get there only to discover the victim is one of their own. Ebola nightmares . One of the local clinics had to be locked up after all the healthcare workers based there contracted the virus. Only one survived. ""It is very heartbreaking. You are working for the team at the front and you see them lying down. Day by day, they are dying,"" says Tamba, who admits the harrowing work he does has caused him nightmares. ""Sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but Ebola, Ebola, Ebola -- nothing else,"" he explains. ""Several times I dream I become infected, I see myself in the case management center."" But he says that amid all the bad news, he is beginning to hear happier tidings: an increasing number of Ebola survivors, people who initially tested positive for the virus but -- because they reported it early and because of the medical teams' efforts -- later recovered. These positive outcomes keep Tamba hopeful as he and other health workers continue to tirelessly explain to the community how to prevent infection. ""It is difficult to stand in front of Ebola, but this is the situation we have,"" he says. ""We must do everything we can to kick Ebola out of our country. ""Staying at home or running away from Ebola is not a solution, so we have to face it. We have to fight it. To get it to zero."" READ MORE: Ebola death toll passes 1,550, outbreak worsens .

"Basel (CNN) -- Imagine a world where computing becomes invisible, like your thoughts. A world where the interface between our senses, our minds and brains, and a digital device that emulates human traits or which augments our own capabilities becomes seamless, and the border between ""it"" and ""us"" becomes opaque. Imagine instant access to the world's data and content, without typing or without even searching -- think GoogleNow x100, projected onto your iris. The power of IBM's Watson at the disposal of every doctor, with a blink of an eye or a simple voice command. Anticipatory services that know what you need before you do. Constant reads of my body's status via my wristwatch. Convenient. Incredible. Empowering. Beautiful. Addictive. Indispensable. Scary. Here soon. Vast progress and vast curses . ""Nothing vast enters the lives of mortals without a curse"" Greek tragedian Sophocles once said. And plenty of curses are sure to emerge when it's about wearables, which are powered by big data, the cloud, artificial intelligence, not to forget good old-fashioned capitalism. It is the danger of exponential unintended consequences we must start to consider, because we probably don't have the choice to ""just say no"" -- wearable computing is as certain as mobile phones. In his 1964 book ""Understanding Media,"" Marshall McLuhan famously called media ""the extensions of man."" If we can define wearables as ""media"" then, following mobile devices, wearables are the next logical step in this rapid evolution. Beyond this, wearables are very likely to be followed by some kind of direct connectivity of our brains and neural systems with computers (think brain computer interfaces) and implants. You get the picture. We can see so much more -- and we are seen even more . One of the key challenges with wearables may be similar to what we are already facing in digital media and entertainment. Powerful, smart, internet-connected TVs are ushering in an era when we can see pretty much anything we want on enormous super-HD screens, be it TV programs, movies and videos, photos, Skype conversations, tweets, games or telepresence events. But few of us realize that in return our ""TVs"" (think: visual super-computers) can now also ""sense,"" see and hear us using their built-in video cameras, microphones, data-sucking software and face-recognition apps. Indeed, these TVs will truly know who we are and what we do -- and naturally, therein lies their tremendous value to those that can reach us through them. This is about data not just about content -- we are the ones being watched while we are watching content at ever lower cost. Similar (yet much more wicked) issues are certain to arise with the boom in wearable devices. On the one hand, yes, we can be infinitely better and faster in gauging and understanding ourselves and the world around us using smart watches, fitness bands or smart meters. A nicely designed smart-watch that reminds me of my next appointment, alerts me of urgent developments in my stock portfolio, tells me that I should start exercising more or even predicts how likely me and my date are to hit it off... all of this may seem quite useful, at least to some of us. At the same time, the flip side of this amazing new -- and seemingly free -- convenience is that my smart devices, virtual agents and active AI apps will also get to know me better than any human ever could as far as my raw data is concerned. And these will be technologies that are also self-learning. Data flows in both directions, and increasingly a Faustian bargain is struck than would scare the wits out of George Orwell: trade your privacy for convenience; jump into that amazing data and information worm-hole; achieve super-powers! Watch the first episode of The Future Show with Gerd Leonhard on 'Privacy Failure' here . Google Glass and the nude beach problem . To me, wearable computing devices such as Google Glass are facing what I call ""the nude beach problem."" If everyone around me is using Google Glass I may feel like an odd-ball by not ""being naked"" as well. Conversely, if I am the only that's nude (i.e. wearing Google Glass) and everyone else is fully dressed, I would probably not be very welcome. This may help to explain the chilly reception that Google Glass users have received. We urgently need some new social contracts here -- but unfortunately Google has rarely paid much attention to those thorny side-effects of their amazing inventions. This is why I believe the key opportunities for most wearable computing devices is in business or professional situations where it doesn't really matter if only a few people use it, such as with doctors, firefighters or the check-in staff at the airline counter. In all these cases the clear purpose of technology is to better serve us, rather than for us to better serve the technology and those that dish it up. This will emerge as a key distinction because making humans as readable as USB drives, exploiting massive privacy failure -- whether by design or by unintended consequence -- or proposing the complete eradication of anonymity cannot possibly be in the interest of any business or government except for those that seek totalitarian dominance. This is why those that work on wearables need to ask that all-important question: will these devices and services add real, lasting, human value to their users, or will they just be fancy digital mouse traps, addiction-generators or extensions-of-man that seek to eventually ""be man""?

"(CNN) -- In a case that would have been impossible even five years ago, bad-girl rocker Courtney Love is being sued for libel by a fashion designer for allegedly slamming the woman on Twitter. The suit claims that after a disagreement over what Love should pay Dawn Simorangkir for the clothes she designed, Love posted allegedly derogatory and false comments about the designer -- among them that she had a ""history of dealing cocaine"" -- on her now-discontinued Twitter feed. But as technology evolves faster than the laws that govern free speech online, it's not just the famous who are finding trouble. Consider the case of Amanda Bonnen and her former landlord. Bonnen, an Illinois resident, is accused of using Twitter to tell another user: ""Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment was bad for you? Horizon Realty thinks it's okay."" Horizon Group Management LLC, the company that owned the apartment in question, sued Bonnen for libel over the alleged tweet. Horizon is seeking $50,000 in damages. Legal experts say such Internet-related cases are being watched closely because they confront new and unaddressed areas of American law. For example, how should a libel case be handled when it comes to social media? How can society balance accountability with free speech? And if information -- from private thoughts to public data -- is so readily available, how do we define what constitutes privacy? A time of 'cultural shift' Legal experts said it's difficult for the law to keep up with emerging technology. ""Generally, it is at least five years behind technology as it is developing,"" said Andrea Matwyshyn, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, who tracks the intersection of law and technology. There are several reasons why the law tends to play catch-up, experts said. The first is that it's typically difficult to predict or anticipate technology innovations. Think of the music-sharing battles that began -- and are still going on -- after the advent of Napster. Another reason is that it's difficult to handle cases that deal with the Internet and the Web because it confronts a fundamental schism: Is the Web a unique, separate space or is it really an extension of real space? That concept might be a little bit abstract, but think of it this way: When a person dies, a house, property or car owned by that person can be passed on, relatively easily, to a family member or an identified heir. But what about online property like account profiles, passwords and digital content? ""We really haven't thought about this much because there haven't been many generations of users with copious digital assets to even trigger the need to think about what happens if they pass away,"" Matwyshyn said. Another challenge for the law is the way the Web crosses state and international borders. Let's say a Facebook user in England sues another user in Australia for defamatory comments posted on the site. Who has jurisdiction over the case, which country's laws should be applied: England's, Australia's or those of the United States, where Facebook is based? One last hypothetical: Let's look at a Facebook or Twitter network of 10 people. Half of them are co-workers; the other half are not. One co-worker is offended by something another co-worker said. Do harassment laws apply? Does the company that employs some of the people have any liability? ""There's an increasing breakdown of the traditional social boundaries between workplace and homelife, and personal and public information,"" Matwyshyn said. ""It's a time of cultural shift and this is going to take a while to stabilize itself and shake out."" That process, seemingly, has begun. Anonymity and immunity . In August 2008, a user of Blogger.com, a Google subsidiary, created ""Skanks in NYC."" The blog assailed Liskula Cohen, 37, a Canadian-born cover girl who has appeared in Vogue and other fashion magazines, by featuring photos of Cohen captioned with derogatory terms. Cohen sued Google to learn the name of the anonymous blogger on the grounds that the post was defamatory and libelous. A New York Supreme Court judge ordered Google to reveal the anonymous blogger's name, and Google complied. The case provided insight into the debate between the competing values of privacy and free speech, said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst. ""You have a robust debate on a million different subjects every day on the Internet,"" he said. ""But on the other hand, is that a license to damage people's reputation with knowing falsehood?"" The courts are trying to strike a balance between the two, Toobin said. ""There have been a lot of cases about trying to get behind the anonymity of the Internet,"" he said. ""What the courts are ... saying is that you have to show good reason, you can't just frivolously ask."" Nicholas Thompson of Wired magazine said such cases make it clear that anonymity on the Web does not necessarily guarantee a measure of immunity. ""The more people learn about it, the more they're going to realize that laws do apply online,"" he said. 'A world without anonymity' In 2006, Stacy Snyder was a 25-year-old single mother hoping to begin a career as an educator. She had finished her coursework and was a student teacher. Yet Millersville University, located in Pennsylvania, wouldn't give her a degree. Snyder filed a lawsuit alleging the school denied her a degree because administrators discovered a photo on her MySpace page that showed her wearing a pirate's hat and drinking from a plastic cup, with the caption ""drunken pirate."" She lost her case. According to the decision by the court, the school provided alternative reasons for denying Snyder a degree. Whatever the outcome of the case, it speaks to the broader issue of commingling public and private lives in the digital age, experts say. Thanks to the Internet, it's now relatively easy to find the value of a person's home or the extent of their political contributions. Meanwhile, people use social media applications like Flickr or Twitter to share personal details with the world. The result is a blurring of the lines between what ought to be considered private and public. It is the challenge of ""a world without anonymity,"" said Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at George Washington University, who has written extensively about privacy and the law. He is also the legal affairs editor at The New Republic. ""One thing that privacy protects is the ability not to be judged out of context on the basis of isolated snippets of information rather than genuine knowledge,"" he said. So if the law were to catch up to technology, could it actually remedy these situations? Rosen believes the law can only act on society's consensus. ""The law is only good at policing the most extreme invasions and the most outrageous cases,"" he said. ""It can't take the place of good manners, social norms and etiquette -- the kind of thing that has always governed negotiations about face-to-face behavior. ""We should never expect that the judges are going to save us from our own worst impulses.""","As technology evolves at breakneck speed, thorny legal issues are emerging, experts say .

"(CNN) -- Sudan and South Sudan signed an agreement Friday to soon withdraw their respective military forces from a demilitarized zone between the two African countries, officials from both nations said. Signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the deal was brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki. Defense ministers from both Sudan and South Sudan promised they will implement the agreement over the 14-mile-wide area later this month. ""We will be ... committed, definitely, to implement (the agreement) word-by-word and step-by-step,"" Sudan Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Abdal-Rahim Mohamed Hussein said. His South Sudanese counterpart, John Koang Nyoun, promised too that his nation's forces will be pulled out of the ""14 miles and other areas."" South Sudan became independent from Sudan in July 2011, following a popular referendum and a war that left nearly 2 million people dead. But the two nations have remained at odds on some issues, including defining their borders and oil exports. The upcoming withdrawals will be monitored by the commander of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei, according to the state-run Sudan News Agency, also known as SUNA. Under a 2005 peace agreement that ended Sudan's two-decade civil war, Abyei residents were to take part in a referendum on whether to join the South or remain a special administrative region within Sudan. But disputes over who was eligible to vote prevented a scheduled January 2011 referendum from going forward in the hotly disputed, 4,000-square-mile region between the two countries, . And last April, Sudan and South Sudan slipped close to all-out war in series of air and ground exchanges. Sudan and South Sudan have been under increasing pressure from the African Union and U.N. Security Council to resolve that and other disputes peacefully. In September, the two countries' leaders signed a deal to resume oil exports, but failed to address other issues such as the fate of Abyei. When Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and South Sudan President Salva Kiir met again in early 2013, they agreed to temporary administrative and security arrangements for the Abyei region, including the creation of a police service and a limited governing council.","Sudan and South Sudan will withdraw their troops from a 14-mile-wide demilitarized zone .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Tehran's main bazaar reopened for its first full day of activity after demonstrations this week over the country's plummeting currency. The bazaar was open Saturday, as were money exchange shops. ""The price of the dollar on the open market today dropped to (between) 28,500 and 29,000 rials, but the price of all foreign currencies, including the dollar, is still fluctuating and only a few transactions took place today,"" Mohammad Kashtiarai, head of the National Gold and Jewel Association, told the semi-official Mehr News Agency. Sixteen people were arrested Thursday, a day after police dispersed a crowd at the bazaar, where protesters were blaming President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the high price of the dollar and goods in general. Demonstrators chanted slogans opposing firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and decrying the skyrocketing cost of basic goods. The rial's plummet to historic lows is the result of international sanctions, imposed largely by the United States and the European Union in an effort to pressure Iran to sit down for talks on its nuclear program. Ahmadinejad has insisted that sanctions hurt the people, not the government, and that the country's economy ""has become a tool for psychological warfare."" The rial's value was cut in half from September of last year through last month, the Congressional Research Service said in a report. It has fallen even further since, including a sharp nosedive this week, reaching historic lows against the value of the dollar. But protesters in Tehran blamed Ahmadinejad, chanting slogans against his regime and complaining about high prices. Those arrested ""were the main players in the recent fluctuations in the foreign currency market,"" the Tehran Judiciary said in a statement.","Tehran's main bazaar reopened for its first full day of business after protests .

"(CNN) -- In a world where information is plentiful and abundant, traders are always trying to make money by finding that hidden advantage. Many are betting that 140 characters is all it takes to beat the market. Some professionals in the world of high finance are relying on Twitter and other social media to try to get the edge on the competition. Markets went into a spin last year when someone hacked the AP's Twitter account and sent bogus tweets about an explosion at the White House, showing just how powerful a sentence can be when millions of dollars are put behind it. Twitter has transformed communication across a host of industries, but many industries remain straightforward in how they use it. Especially in the world of commodities. In Chicago, traders trade futures contracts in every kind of product, from corn to pork belly to orange juice concentrate futures. Essentially, they are making bets on the demand and supply of these items at a later date. Every extra speck of information can make the difference. Some traders expressly follow farmers across the American Midwest and try to get a sense of how much soybean or maize is coming in this year's crop. Others actively engage with the people that make the products they trade, looking for that edge, directly tweeting farmers for information on what weather they are having and what crops they are growing. But others are using Twitter to in more innovative ways to stay ahead of the pack. ""Our systems can analyze and determine a Tweet in less than a second from the moment a person tweets,"" says Paul Hawtin, the founder of the investment management firm Cayman Atlantic. ""Analyzing untapped and unstructured data sets such as Twitter gives us a distinct advantage over other investment managers."" Hawtin has been working on a fund based exclusively on using sentiment analysis of Twitter for years, analyzing tweets for relevance and for positive and negative sentiment to base its trades on. His first fund was in July 2010, when the U.S. debt stand-off caused huge turmoil in the financial markets and forced the $25 million fund to close after just a month. Hawtin is launching his second try at such a fund later this year. ""We're in the process of raising Â£5 million ($8.3 million) for the new fund and we've secured Â£1.5 million so far,"" he says. If his first fund had taken off, Cayman Atlantic's simulated real-time account showed that it would have returned 23.8% last year -- impressive, but not as good as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which returned 26.5% over the same period. For Hawtin, the benefits of going Twitter-only are obvious. ""Breaking news, information trends and global events hit the Twitter network before anywhere else,"" he says. Twitter appears to be a special case. They have tried to feed in data from Facebook and Bit.ly, the URL shortener, but to no avail. ""When people tweet they tend to be talking about real-world events as opposed to Facebook which is more personal and relevant only to friends and family."" Others are trying to turn the world of trading into the new Twitter. Yoni Assia founded eToro in 2007 as a social network for investing and sees it as democratizing the space. ""It's about opening the global market and investing and trading in a transparent way,"" he says. ""When you're using Facebook or Twitter, it's about social signals. So not all your friends are ones whose financial investments you really want to copy."" His network allows anyone to trade both virtual and real money, connect with one other and compare investment bets -- and copy the trading strategies of others. EToro, which is not yet available in the U.S. because of regulatory hurdles, has 3.5 million registered users, of which most are using virtual money. About 300,000 are trading with their own cash on the site. It's Facebook-meets-fantasy football for wannabe day traders. Assia thinks we're at the start of a change in how we invest, one that will transform trading decisions to ones not just based off reactions to real-world events or mathematical modelling, but one based on the analysis of social media as well. ""I think in the future you'll have not just fundamental and technical analysis, but social analysis,"" he says. Hawtin, the founder of the Cayman Islands-based hedge fund, concurs. ""We're in the middle of a data explosion,"" he says. ""Trend-following has been a successful trading strategy for over a century and that forms the core of our investment process. What makes us different from any other trend-following hedge fund is the data we use."" With billions to be made, Twitter and social media may end up being one of the democratizing forces in the world of finance.

"(CNN) -- It is 1a.m. at the Manila offices of VXi and nearly everyone is on the phone. Hundreds of employees, each wearing a headset, are answering calls from thousands of miles away, providing technical advice and sales services to customers of some of the United States' best-known companies. VXi is at the center of one of the Philippine's greatest economic success stories of the last decade: call centers. Industry experts estimate that the industry here has grown to $11 billion and employs over 600,000 workers. That's even more than in India. ""You'd be hard pressed to find families that don't have one person in their families employed in the call center industry,"" says Eppie Titong, senior site director at VXi's Manila office. While the Philippines has struggled to grow other industries such as manufacturing or tourism, the country has found it is uniquely positioned to excel in the call center business. Thanks to historical ties to the United States, the Philippines has a large, English-speaking population, with an accent that many consider light or easy for the American ear. Most Filipinos are also familiar with American cultural exports, ranging from American Idol to Krispy Kreme donuts. This informal bond, employers say, makes it easier for them to relate to Americans over the telephone. Philippine culture is also known for its hospitality. ""We are friendly,"" says call center supervisor Audison ""Ives"" Tan Dejos. ""We do care. We have the empathy."" On the economic front, the Philippines is an affordable place to do business. An entry-level call center employee can make about $470 a month, which is a very good salary for the Philippines but far less than their counterparts are paid in the U.S. or Europe. The influx of outsourced jobs is a major gift for a country that struggles to put its more than 90 million people to work. The official unemployment rate is around 7% and many people are forced to settle for part-time jobs. Not that the call center industry is going to fix all the country's employment problems. 600,000 is a drop in the bucket compared to the size of the population and these jobs are targeted primarily at those with a college education. ""Who can provide jobs for moderately skilled workers like high school graduates or less educated workers?"" asks Norio Usui, Senior Country Economist at the Asian Development Bank. ""The Philippines has plenty of such workers also."" For Tan Dejos, whose wife also works at VXi, the work is stressful at times but it allows them to comfortably support their three children. He doesn't mind the night shift, he says, and he likes the challenge of being in an emerging industry. Would he want his kids to work at a call center? ""I would,"" he says without hesitation. ""It's really up to them.""","Philippines has more call center workers than India .

"(CNN) -- The Sauber Formula One team has expressed its sympathy to the loved ones of the track marshal who died Sunday after falling under a crane that was removing one of its crashed cars from the Montreal circuit. The man was helping move Esteban Gutierrez's vehicle during the Canadian Grand Prix when he tripped and fell into the path of the crane, the F1 website reported. He was taken to Sacre-Coeur Hospital but died of his injuries. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the marshal who sadly passed away and we would like to offer our sincere condolences,"" Sauber said on the team's Twitter page Monday. Mexican driver Gutierrez had earlier tweeted: ""My dearest condolences to the family of the marshal who lost his life today, our prayers for him & his family. RIP."" Race winner Sebastian Vettel also offered his condolences. ""The work of marshals is not always seen but it is vital to our sport and without their commitment, time and dedication, there would be no motorsport,"" Red Bull's triple world champion said on his website. Interactive: Montreal track guide, results and standings . The Ferrari team of second-placed Fernando Alonso also issued a statement. ""The winners and losers from this seventh round of the championship, along with the workers and the fans who watched the race from the grandstands or on television, are all thinking of someone who lost their life in an absurd way while involved in what was surely their passion -- racing,"" its website reported. ""Indeed, without the work of people like him, events like Formula One grands prix could not even take place. ""Ferrari wishes to express its condolences for the death of this track marshal too: we are doing it here, via the internet, to invite everyone who shares our passion for motorsport to be thinking of the family and friends of the victim."" Motorsport's ruling body the FIA released details of the incident late Sunday . ""The worker, a member of the Automobile Club de l'Ile Notre Dame, was the victim of an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of this afternoon's Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada,"" it said in a statement. ""The worker was helping to recover a car which had stopped during the race. The recovery vehicle had lifted the car to return it to the pits and while doing this the worker dropped his radio and attempted to pick it up. As he did this, he stumbled and was hit and run over by the recovery vehicle. ""The FIA, l'Automobile Club de l'Ile Notre-Dame and the Formula One Grand Prix du Canada want to communicate their deepest condolences to the family and friends of the victim. The identity of the worker cannot be revealed at this time."" It was the first time an F1 track worker has died since 2001, in Melbourne, while another passed away at the Italian circuit of Monza the previous year. Graham Beveridge was killed at the Australian Grand Prix after being hit by a flying wheel from Jacques Villeneuve's BAR-Honda, just months after volunteer firefighter Paolo Ghislimberti suffered fatal head and chest injuries when a loose wheel from the Jordan of Heinz-Harald Frentzen struck him. Those incidents prompted a major review of safety precautions at F1 races.","Track worker dies after falling under crane during Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina man's decision to put tattoos on his two dogs is drawing yelps of criticism and wagging tails of support across social media. Ernesto Rodriguez, a tattoo artist, said he put the intricate tattoos on the bellies of his two dogs so they could be easily identified if they were lost. ""They both have their tattoos on them just in case anything happens to them,"" Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WGHP-TV. In fact, tattooing is an acceptable form of identification for animals and even is one method advocated by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. ""Have dogs microchipped or tattooed through the National Dog Registry,"" PETA says on its website, pointing out that unidentified animals can fall into the wrong hands. ""It is a crime in some states to perform experiments on animals with tattoos,"" PETA says. The National Dog Registry recommends on its website that a number of the owner's choice be tattooed on the pet in an easily visible spot. But on social media, some of Rodriguez's critics say he took the identification idea too far. ""My opinion is that if you want to mark your dog you don't have to do it so large. The skin on a dog's stomach is thin and will be more painful for the healing process. Nothing wrong with a small marking but a large one is a little much,"" Jennifer L. Ward wrote in a post on Rodriguez's Facebook page. And on Twitter, Kristine Lacoste, managing editor and Buzz editor of Pets Adviser.com, posted, ""It's a pretty big tattoo; seems overboard for just identification purposes, doesn't it?"" Rodriguez, who said the animals were sedated when the tattoos were applied, disagrees. ""It's just art; I'm an artist, I want to put art on my dogs,"" he said. And he certainly has his supporters. Writing on the Facebook page of CNN affiliate WXII-TV, Cheri Iverson said her pets have tattoos applied at local spay-and-neuter clinics. ""I wish their tattoos were this creative,"" Iverson wrote.","North Carolina man put intricate tattoos on his two dogs .

"(CNN) -- Michael Chang is in the record books as the youngest winner of a grand slam but his French Open triumph in 1989 is largely remembered for one extraordinary moment in a last 16 match against Ivan Lendl. Few people gave the 17-year-old Chinese American much chance against the world number one and three-time French Open champion. The odds lengthened still further when the Czech took a two sets lead. But Chang fought back to level at two sets all, despite suffering from cramp at the end of the fourth set. ""I actually knew I was in trouble at the end of the fourth because I started cramping. Our match was about four hours and 37 minutes and against Ivan on clay, that's a pretty long time,"" he told CNN. But it got even worse as the match went into the decider on Court Philippe Chatrier at Roland Garros as Chang recounts. ""In the fifth set, at 2-1 in the fifth set, I almost decided to call it quits, I couldn't serve, I couldn't dig out any balls that were hit in the corners and I walked to the service line, to basically tell the umpire I can't play anymore, I'm done."" But Chang, who has strong religious beliefs, had a sudden change of heart. Unbelievable conviction . ""I get to the service line and I get an unbelievable conviction, just a conviction in my heart and it was almost as if God was saying, what are you doing? ""It dawned on me that if I was to quit then and there, every other difficult time I have there on the court it was just going to make it that much easier to quit. ""And from there, it wasn't so much a matter of winning and losing, my objective that day was to finish the race which was that match, which was that fifth set. Win or lose I had to finish the match."" The resilient Chang started to hit slow looping returns ""moonballs"" to recover and give himself more time and it worked as he forged a 4-3 lead -- until the cramps returned with a vengeance. Trailing 15-30 on his own service, the writing was on the wall when Chang decided on an unconventional approach, which was to decide the outcome of the match. ""Then at 15-30, spur of the moment, I was just like, I'm going to throw an underhand serve in here, cause I'm not doing anything off my first serve anyways. ""Let's see if maybe I can scrape a point. I hit the underhand serve, Ivan was kind of surprised about it, moved, kind of got squeezed in because of the spin and had to come in because the serve was so short. I hit a passing shot, clipped the tape and it went off the top of his racket and the crowd went absolutely nuts !. Mental battle . ""And you can see Ivan going back to the baseline to return the 30-all point and he was kind of going like this (tapping his head) and it became a sort of mental battle."" Lendl did not win another game as Chang closed out the match, but it was another unconventional tactic which sealed his victory as he forged two match points on his opponent's service. ""I had two match points so I might as well take a crack at one of them. I've got a second serve coming, he's got to be a little bit tight, my shots have been going in so I might as well take one good rip at it, I've got another one if I happen to miss it and that's what my mentality was."" Chang's ""tactic"" was to stand right in on Lendl's delivery almost at the service line and it rattled the legendary Czech. ""The crowd started going nuts, they started whistling and stuff like that. He actually looked up at Richard Ins (the chair umpire) and was like hey, the crowd's making a noise, can I hit a first serve, and Richard told him no, and he stepped up and threw the double, double fault."" It was an extraordinary end to an extraordinary match and Chang eventually progressed into the title match against Sweden's Stefan Edberg. Once again he faced an uphill battle as Edberg recovered from a set down to lead two sets to one and was on top in the fourth. ""The fourth set I should have lost, I was down 11 break points and I only had one break point, it just happened to be on set point,"" Chang said. ""And I snuck that one, and then I think Stefan was a little tired in the fifth even though he was up early with a break."" History books . Once it was retrieved, Chang charged through the decider, taking it 6-2 to claim his place in the tennis record books . With the momentous events in Tiananmen Square taking place on the middle weekend of that French Open, Chang wanted to dedicate his victory to the wider Chinese community in his native America and around the world. ""I almost kind of feel that it was almost God's purpose for me to win that French Open. ""I really think it was about putting a smile on Chinese people's faces when there wasn't a whole lot to smile about. That's part of the reason why I think the French Open happened in the way that it did."" It's 23 years since Chang's unexpected triumph - his only grand slam title. He lost to Thomas Muster in the 1995 French Open final and to Boris Becker and Pete Sampras at the Australian and U.S. Open finals of 1996. The 1995 loss to Austrian legend Muster still hurts, but Chang believes it would have been hard to match the impact of his 1989 triumph. ""I don't know if any grand slam win following that one would have been more special. That being said, I would have liked to have won in 1995 in the finals but it was not meant to be,"" he said. Major force . Chang remained a major force on the ATP tour throughout the 90s, a decade which began with a notable triumph for the United States. "" I think the other highlights of my career would have to be winning the Davis Cup in 1990 and a career No.2 in the world, being inducted into the International International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2008 and also meeting my wife Amber through tennis! I have much to be thankful for!"" he added. Chang retired from the main tour in 2003, but still competes on the Champions Tour and in World Team Tennis. He pairs up in mixed doubles with his wife of four years Amber Liu, who is a former two-time NCAA champion from Stanford University. They have a young daughter, ""hopefully there'll be a racket in her hand sometime soon,"" said Chang, who is a keen supporter of junior tennis. He also keeps an eye on the achievements of Chinese players and welcomed Li Na's victory in the women's singles at last year's French Open. ""I do know Li Na a little bit, I did send her a congratulatory email."" Lin connection . Chang is also in content with another Chinese American who is making making the sort of headlines he did back in 1989. Both he and Knicks basketball sensation Jeremy Lin share a strong Christian faith and they have spoken about their wider responsibilities. ""As far as being a role model, I think it's very important for Jeremy to realize that he is just that not only for the Chinese community but also everywhere else. ""To have the opportunity to touch and impact lives is such a honor and privilege and I hope Jeremy will use the platform that he has to inspire and encourage people wherever he goes."" Chang was certainly an inspirational figure during his tennis career and epic triumph at the French Open in 1989 looks set to stay in the record books for many years to come.","Michael Chang won French Open in 1989 aged just 17 .

"(CNN) -- Start-ups often keep the ""beta test phase"" label on their products for a time after the official launch to stress that the product is not finished so much as ready for the next batch of improvements. Gmail, for example, launched in 2004 but only left official beta in 2009, after millions of people were already using it. Jeff Bezos, founder/CEO of Amazon, concludes every annual letter to shareholders by reminding readers, as he did in his first annual letter in 1997, that ""it's still Day 1"" of the internet and of Amazon.com. For entrepreneurs, ""finished"" is an F-word, because they know that great companies are always evolving. ""Finished"" ought to be an F-word for all of us. Because when it comes to our career, we are all works in progress. Each day presents an opportunity to learn more, do more, be more, grow more, often in unexpected or unpredictable ways. Keeping your career in permanent beta forces you to acknowledge that you have bugs, that there's new development to do on yourself, that you will need to adapt and evolve. It is a lifelong commitment to continuous personal and professional growth. Entrepreneurs penetrate the fog of the unknown by testing their products, and their hypotheses, through trial and error. Any entrepreneur (and any expert on cognition/learning) will tell you that practical knowledge is best developed by doing, not just thinking or planning. In the early days of LinkedIn, the plan was to have members invite their trusted connections by email -- an invitation mechanism that would fuel membership growth. But it turned out that the best way to enable viral spread was actually to enable members to upload their address books and see who else was on the service already. For careers, too, you don't know what the best plan is until you try. Lunging at the first well-paid and/or high-status job you come upon may offer immediate gratification, but it won't get you any closer to building a meaningful career. See also: Why ambition could make you rich, but not happy . The business professor Clayton Christensen once told graduating students at Harvard Business School, ""If you study the root causes of business disasters, over and over you'll find (a) predisposition toward endeavors that offer immediate gratification."" At the same time, though, don't do the opposite and think ahead too far in the future. Again, you will change, the world will change, the competition will change. Entrepreneurs deal with these uncertainties, changes, and constraints head-on. They take stock of their assets, aspirations and the market realities to develop a competitive advantage. They craft flexible, iterative plans. They build a network of relationships throughout their industry that outlives their current venture. They aggressively seek and create breakout opportunities that involve focused risk, and actively manage that risk. They tap their network for the business intelligence to navigate tough challenges. And, they do these things from the moment they hatch that nascent idea to every day after that -- even as their companies go from being run out of a garage to occupying floors of office space. Companies act small to retain an innovative edge no matter how large they grow. That is why Steve Jobs famously called Apple the ""biggest start-up on the planet."" To succeed professionally in today's world, you need to adopt this same permanent beta mindset. You need to stay young and agile. You need to draw up plans, but be nimble enough to stray from those plans when appropriate. You must be persistent in fulfilling your vision, but also be ready to shift course based on the changing demands of the job market or economic landscape. You must be ever evolving. See also: Is workplace boredom 'the new stress?' And in the same way that entrepreneurs are always improving and investing in their products, you need to always be improving and investing in yourself. Make a plan to develop skills and experiences that are broadly useful to potential other jobs. Writing skills, general management experience, technical and computer skills, people smarts, and international experience or language skills are examples of skills with what we call high option value -- that is, they are transferable to a wide range of possible options. Once you've figured out which transferable skills to invest in, make a concrete action plan you can stick to, whether by signing up for a course or conference, or simply by pledging to spend one hour each week teaching yourself something. Begin on an experimental side project that you work on during some nights and weekends. Orient it around a skill or experience that is different but related to what you do now. Ideally, collaborate on this project with someone else in your network. Do whatever it takes to keep yourself relevant. Because winning careers, like winning start-ups, are in permanent beta: always a work in progress.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- U.S. safety officials have recalled about 4.2 million Chinese-made Aqua Dots bead toys that contain a chemical that has caused some children to vomit and become comatose after swallowing them. Bindeez, which were named Australia's toy of the year, contain a chemical that converts into a ""date rape"" drug. Scientists have found the popular toy's coating contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic ""date rape"" drug GHB, or gamma-hydroxy butyrate, U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission spokesman Scott Wolfson told CNN. ""GHB is this drug that in low doses actually causes euphoria,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. ""In higher doses, it can cause people to go into a coma. It can cause seizures. It can cause something known as hypotonia, where all your muscles just become very flaccid. ""And it can cause people to become amnestic, ...  which is why it became a date-rape drug,"" Gupta said. ""So this is nasty stuff, and it appears that the chemical is actually converting into it in the body."" The arts and craft beads, aimed at children 4 years and older, have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores as ""Aqua Dots"" and in Australia under the name ""Bindeez Beads."" CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said anyone with Aqua Dots at home should immediately take the toy away from children and contact distributor Spin Master Ltd. to return for free replacement beads or a toy of equal value. For additional information, contact Spin Master at 1-800-622-8339 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday. The toy was named toy of the year in Australia and recently  made Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed Aqua Dots on its Web site as ""out of stock online"" and had removed them from its top toy list. Toronto-based Spin Master stopped shipping Aqua Dots and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they had sold for $17 to $30.  Watch what's known about the beads » . Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. recalled Bindeez Beads on Tuesday after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. ""I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,"" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was sickened by the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old ""swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state."" The toddler was hospitalized and has since fully recovered, the commission added. In the second incident, a child vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. The recall is the latest to target Chinese-made toys.  See if your child has any recalled toys » . Last month, U.S. government safety officials and retailers recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause lead poisoning.

"(CNN) -- When President Obama announced on Wednesday his proposals to curb gun violence, no surprise: Gun advocates condemned it as the first step in a rapid slide toward tyranny. The night before, the National Rifle Association released an ad calling Obama an ""elitist hypocrite,"" because, the ad says, he's ""skeptical about putting armed security in our schools, when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school."" (Obama had said in an interview last month that he was ""skeptical"" that the ""only answer"" was putting more guns in schools.) Republicans and Democrats alike condemned the NRA for using the president's children in a political attack ad, but the ad was actually quite revealing. A sane person might argue that the president and his family require special protection because they face threats the rest of us don't. But the NRA and many of its most fervent supporters don't see it that way. As far as they're concerned, all of us are just as threatened as the person in the Oval Office. The fact that you're an ordinary person and not the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth doesn't mean you haven't already been targeted by an al Qaeda death squad or a murderous drug gang, so you'd better be prepared, not just with a gun but with an entire arsenal of military-style weaponry. But the real threat in the fantasy world some gun owners have spun inside their heads isn't terrorists. You know the people I'm talking about: the ""doomsday preppers,"" the angry tea partiers talking about ""watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants,"" the folks who can't talk about guns for 30 seconds without bringing up Hitler (who, for what it's worth, didn't actually disarm the German people, as so many gun advocates believe). What's important isn't just that these folks are paranoid, it's who they're paranoid about: the United States government. Opinion: Real hypocrites are at NRA . Take, for one vivid example, James Yeager, the CEO of a Tennessee company called Tactical Response. In response to the prospect of stricter gun laws, he posted a YouTube video saying, ""If that happens, it's gonna spark a civil war, and I'll be glad to fire the first shot. ... I'm not letting my country be ruled by a dictator. I'm not letting anybody take my guns. If it goes one inch further, I'm gonna start killing people."" And who is it, exactly, whom he'd be killing in this fantasy of his? His neighbors? No, he'd be killing the duly constituted authorities of the United States. He's talking about -- maybe dreaming about -- the day when police officers or members of the U.S. military come to his door, so he can kill them. (Yeager later apologized after Tennessee officials suspended his concealed carry permit.) OK, so this guy is an extremist. But there are thousands, maybe millions, of gun owners out there whose sentiments are only a notch or two more restrained. These people talk a lot about liberty and freedom and love to call themselves patriots, but they seem to have a real problem with democracy. In a democracy, if people are proposing a law you don't like, you criticize it, you argue against it, you campaign against it, you vote against the politicians who support it. But if you believe in democracy, you don't threaten to start killing people if it passes. You don't say that if you don't like a new law, you'll start an insurrection to overthrow the government. Yet that's exactly what some people are saying, and it isn't just some lonely nut with a webcam and a YouTube account. People like him are spurred on by a conservative media that encourages them to believe that every Obama administration effort they disagree with isn't just something objectionable, it's the very definition of dictatorship. Opinion: Gun control is on all of us . If you're a regular listener to conservative talk radio, you've heard Barack Obama compared to Hitler and Stalin innumerable times, over every issue from health care to taxes (after Obama's press conference, one Fox News Radio host tweeted, ""Freedom ends. Tyranny begins.""). Since his election in 2008, supposedly respectable politicians have talked about simply refusing to obey laws they don't like, and some even proposed seceding from the union. To be clear, most gun owners aren't stockpiling canned goods and assault rifles in preparation for some kind of societal breakdown that will give them permission to act out the violent fantasies they've been nurturing for years. But many would say that their ""right"" to own any and every kind of firearm they please is the only thing that guarantees that tyranny won't come to the United States. Well, guess what: They're wrong. In today's world, most tyrants aren't overthrown by an armed populace. Nonviolent revolutions can result in a quick transition to democracy, while violent insurrections often result in long and bloody civil wars. And here in America, it isn't 1776, and it won't ever be again. The founders may have thought citizens should be able to keep a musket if they wanted, but they also wrote into the Constitution that the government had the obligation to ""suppress insurrections."" They hoped that our freedom would be guaranteed by our laws and institutions, not by a guy down the block with an AR-15 and a chip on his shoulder. They certainly didn't set up our democracy in the hope that every time any group of people didn't like a law that democracy produced, they'd abandon any pretense of support for our system of government and start killing the cops and soldiers who protect us. There's a word for people who dream about doing that, and it isn't ""patriot."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Waldman.","Paul Waldman: Obama announced gun curbs; gun advocates said it'll be tyranny .
NRA ad calling Obama ""elitist"" because his kids get protection is not sane view, he says .
He says some gun advocates urge resistance to duly authorized law enforcement .

"(CNN) -- Airmen toss dirt bikes out the rear of an airborne plane. Then, a so-called ""bike chaser"" jumps out after them. When U.S. troops take control of an airfield in a combat zone, this often is how it begins. Parachutes unfurl. The motorbikes float to earth along with the bike chaser, who quickly cranks one of the motorcycles to life. Soon, the airfield is secured and ready for incoming U.S. aircraft. That's a typical mission for Air Force combat control teams, CCTs for short. And, along with seizing airfields, they help ground force commanders and pilots pinpoint targets in war zones. These kinds of special forces could be useful on the ground in Iraq, military analysts say, in the event of U.S. airstrikes against Islamic extremists. The Navy has its SEALs. The Army has Delta Force. And the Air Force has combat controllers: a lesser known special ops ground force sometimes referred to as ""ground pounders."" Maj. Charlie Hodges, who served with CCTs in Iraq and Afghanistan, spent a few minutes on the phone with CNN Wednesday to offer an inside perspective on these highly trained, elite squads. ""All of our guys are trained to ride motorcycles,"" says Hodges. Sometimes going to work ""involves jumping out of an airplane, or sliding out a helicopter down a fast rope, or riding some sort of all-terrain vehicle, or going on a mountain path on foot."" Combat controllers are trained to help fighter pilots hit their targets more accurately without killing innocent civilians or friendly troops. That's a resource that military analysts say would be important now in Iraq's efforts to combat ISIS militants. Iraq's government has asked the United States for airstrikes against ISIS, as it encroaches on the nation's key cities. Limited airstrikes might be possible, analysts say, if U.S. forces were inserted where they could accurately identify targets. For days, military sources have said ISIS fighters are dispersed and mixed with local populations, making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes. Retired U.S. Marine Gen. John R. Allen, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The New York Times this month, ""It's feasible for the U.S. to play a limited role with air power with (special operations forces) combat controllers and limited advisers."" On Thursday, President Barack Obama announced the United States had ""positioned additional U.S. military assets in the region."" ""Because of increased intelligence resources,"" he said, the United States is ""developing more information about potential targets associated with (ISIS), and going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it."" The President didn't offer any specifics. Related story: Who are the U.S. advisers heading to Iraq? Let's not forget that at the beginning of the Afghanistan war in 2001, ground controllers teamed up with Northern Alliance fighters to help U.S. pilots target and smash the Taliban. It's surprising: In this age of superaccurate smart bombs and camera-enabled, missile-toting drones, Hodges says human targeting intelligence remains the gold standard. ""People think that because they see it in a Jason Bourne movie"" that technology can do everything, Hodges says. ""But I don't think we're ever going to have a totally,100% air-centric war. I think we're always going to need boots on the ground."" Their job ranks among the most dangerous in the military. Think about it: These guys regularly work near or inside the target zones of some of the most fearsome flying machines devised by man: the A-10 ""warthog,"" the B-2 stealth bomber, the Apache helicopter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the AC-130 gunship. 'It can be kind of squirrelly' Falling safely from the air to the ground with all that gear is no small feat. A typical drop comes with two motorcycles. Bike sizes often range from minibikes with 100 cubic centimeter engines to dirt bikes with 250 cubic centimeter engines. The motorcycles are dropped in packages called ""bike bundles."" Small bikes have parachutes attached to the handlebars. ""It's small enough you can literally pick it up and just throw it out the back of the aircraft,"" says Hodges. ""And that's what they'll do."" Engines are limited to around 250 cubic centimeters, Hodges says, because the combat controllers are riding with 100 pounds of gear on their backs. ""When you have your center of gravity that high, it can be kind of squirrelly,"" he says. ""So we do a fair amount of training,"" starting with a certified Motorcycle Safety Foundation course followed by intensive experience with various four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Bike chasers retrieve and mount the motorcycles and use them to quickly secure the air field runways and clear them of obstacles. ""Hopefully the bike's got an electric start â€” and not just a kickstarter,"" Hodges says. If the bike takes a tumble when it lands, that could temporarily mess up its fuel system, he says, making it troublesome to fire up with a kickstarter. In addition to helping ID air targets, these troops also work to protect civilians and allied forces on the ground. ""If they're being fired on by the enemy, we can bring in aircraft,"" Hodges says. Controllers also have access to special airborne surveillance assets that give them ""eyes in the sky"" for U.S. ground troops who need to know ""what's on the other side of that building,"" as Hodges put it. ""When you're pinned down and can't move, having eyes in the sky to take out the enemy is pretty instrumental in making sure your guys come back alive."" Air control for earthquake victims . Attached to the Air Force 24th Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Florida, these guys are FAA certified air traffic controllers. In 2010, the CCTs deployed to Haiti, responding to a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that left more than 230,000 people dead. At the airport in Port-au-Prince, ""nobody was sure of the structural integrity of the tower,"" says Hodges. ""So they set up in the infield and they landed 200 planes a day â€” all with notebook paper, a card table and handheld radios."" Two-hundred planes a day rivals air traffic at some of the world's busiest airports, including Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson. The camaraderie you might expect between pilots and combat controllers is strong, Hodges says. ""It's always neat when you've worked with a guy here in the States and then go overseas and they call up and you recognize their call sign."" There's also some professional, good-natured rivalry. ""We remind them that they're flying around in their air-conditioned cockpits,"" he says. ""We're on the ground in the heat and humidity, carrying 100 pounds on our backs.""","Combat control teams are the Air Force's lesser known elite special ops ground force .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Sunday that United States needs to focus on Afghanistan in its battle against terrorism. Sen. Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai meet Sunday in Kabul. ""The Afghan government needs to do more. But we have to understand that the situation is precarious and urgent here in Afghanistan. And I believe this has to be our central focus, the central front, on our battle against terrorism,"" Obama said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""I think one of the biggest mistakes we've made strategically after 9/11 was to fail to finish the job here, focus our attention here. We got distracted by Iraq,"" he said. Obama said troop levels must increase in Afghanistan. ""For at least a year now, I have called for two additional brigades, perhaps three,"" he told CBS. ""I think it's very important that we unify command more effectively to coordinate our military activities. But military alone is not going to be enough."" Obama met Sunday with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, a leader the Democratic senator has criticized for not doing enough to rebuild the war-torn nation. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee met with Karzai in Kabul, the capital city, during Obama's first visit to the Asian nation. Karzai's spokesman characterized the senator's message as pleasant. ""They're happy to be in Afghanistan. They reassured the support of U.S. people to Afghanistan,"" Humayoon Hamidzada said. Karzai met with the congressional delegation that includes Obama, and they discussed the achievements of the Afghan government as well as challenges such as terrorism, corruption and illegal drugs.  See a map with photos of Obama's trip » . McCain's senior foreign policy adviser criticized Obama on Sunday for ""stubbornly adhering to an unconditional withdrawal that places politics above the advice of our military commanders, the success of our troops and the security of the American people."" ""Barack Obama is wrong to advocate withdrawal at any cost just as he was wrong to oppose the surge that has put victory within reach. It is a strategy for defeat, and it is the only strategy Barack Obama has ever supported,"" Randy Scheunemann said in a statement. Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan on Saturday to visit American forces under NATO's Regional Command East, the coalition's Combined Joint Task Force said. Obama is joined by Sen. Charles Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, and Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island. In a joint statement released Sunday, the three senators expressed confidence that progress would be made in Afghanistan. ""We need a sense of urgency and determination. We need urgency because the threat from the Taliban and al Qaeda is growing and we must act; we need determination because it will take time to prevail. But with the right strategy and the resources to back it up, we will get the job done,"" they said in the statement. Shortly after meeting with Karzai, Obama left Afghanistan to continue a trip that will take him to the Middle East and Europe. Obama will travel to Jordan, then visit Israel, Germany, France and England. Although Obama is making the trip as a senator from Illinois and not a presidential candidate, it is aimed at boosting Obama's foreign policy credentials.  Watch analyst discuss Obama's visit in Afghanistan » . Obama has made Afghanistan a key focus of his foreign policy, saying he would make it the central front in the ""war on terror"" if elected. Earlier in the day, Obama dined with U.S. troops at an American base in the Afghan capital.  Watch Obama get some ""chow"" » . ""This is my favorite thing to do,"" Obama said as he sat with about two dozen soldiers, sailors and airmen in a military mess hall. Ahead of the trip to Afghanistan, Obama, Reed and Hagel stopped in Kuwait to visit U.S. troops, Obama campaign spokesman Robert Gibbs said. They left Washington on Thursday. In Kuwait, the senators visited Camp Arifjan for about two hours to meet with U.S. Army Central leadership, take a brief tour of the base and talk with soldiers, U.S. military spokesman Lt. Col. Bill Nutter said. The senators also met with about 1,000 military members at a gymnasium, who cheered jubilantly at their arrival. Later, Obama played basketball with some soldiers, drawing cheers from his successful shots.  Watch Obama visit troops in Kuwait » . Asked whether he would have tough talk for the leaders of Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama said he was ""more interested in listening than doing a lot of talking."" ""I think it is very important to recognize that I'm going over there as a U.S. senator. We have one president at a time, so it's the president's job to deliver those messages,"" Obama said. The fight in Afghanistan has become a more pressing issue on the political radar. Three times as many coalition soldiers and other military personnel have died in July in Afghanistan, compared with Iraq. July's death toll for coalition troops reached 22 after the Friday death of a Canadian soldier was announced. Nine U.S. soldiers were killed July 13 in a fight with about 200 Taliban militants in eastern Afghanistan. It was the deadliest attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan in three years.

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- ""This shouldn't be happening"" -- these were the words of a visibly nervous and frustrated sheriff of the court as he rang the outside bell and knocked at the gate belonging to a woman still considered by many in South Africa as the ""mother of the nation."" Joe Maluleke and two other officials arrived at Winnie Mandela's house in Soweto on Tuesday to execute a court order granting a Johannesburg school permission to auction her belongings and pay an old debt. Among the goods meant to go under the hammer were 50 paintings, a round table, chairs and a silver tea set. The problems started when the ex-wife of Nelson Mandela, the country's first black president and an international icon, registered her great niece, Nobantu Vutela, as a boarding student at Abbotts College in Northcliff, Johannesburg, according to court papers filed in 2008. The accommodation fees for the year were 40,000 South African rand -- the equivalent of about $4,000 today. Winnie Mandela, 76, who earns an annual salary of around $90,000, as a member of parliament, was given six months to pay the full amount. It's unclear why she and not the girl's own parents enrolled her into the private school. Despite the documents stipulating that R10,000 ($1000) be paid up front, lawyers representing the school say Mrs Mandela never paid a cent. They started instituting proceedings against her in October 2008. The case dragged on for five years. A lawyer acting on behalf of the school told CNN Mrs Mandela made her first payment last year but that she still owes nearly $5,000 with interest included. Mrs Mandela's lawyer is disputing the interest amount. With dozens of journalists surrounding him, not a single bidder in sight, and Mrs Mandela's bodyguards stationed on the other side of the wall, Sheriff Maluleke knocked in vain. People could be seen moving around inside and outside the house, but nobody came out to let the sheriff in. At one point a car sped out of the premises using a side entrance. It is unclear who was in the car. Maluleke was instructed by lawyers to get a locksmith and force his way into Mandela's house, but he was understandably reluctant. At one point a spectator shouted, ""Why don't you climb over the wall?"" The sheriff's irritated retort: ""And get shot at?"" The tense standoff lasted for about two hours. Maluleke left Winnie Mandela's property empty-handed and dejected. He later admitted that the task he was expected to carry out was a difficult one. ""Is it because she is the mother of the nation?"" he was asked. ""Exactly,"" he responded. Read this: How South Africa avoided 'bloody racial war' On Monday night Winnie Mandela's lawyer Yandisa Dudula had been frantically trying to stop the auction from going ahead. ""Mrs. Mandela has given me a check for R16,000 ($1,696), and another R4,000 ($212) has been given to the sheriff,"" he told CNN. ""The auction is not necessary."" The school's lawyers insisted on getting the money in cash, failing which, they said the sale of her goods would go ahead as planned. Confused neighbors looked on as the spectacle at Mandela's property unfolded. ""We thought she had money, it is very surprising that her goods are now having to be auctioned in order to recoup funds for a debt,"" one of them told CNN. When asked what it is like to live next door ""the mother of the nation,"" the neighbor said, ""We never see her. When the old man (Nelson Mandela) lived in Soweto he would walk around, shake people's hands, greet and talk to them, he even invited us into his home."" ""Winnie keeps to herself, but we still call her 'mother of the nation' and no-one wants to see her humiliated,"" the neighbor said. Commentators say Winnie Mandela has become increasingly isolated, not only by her political family, the ruling African National Congress, but seemingly by her biological family as well. ""Internal tensions within the family could have played a role in no one coming to Mrs Mandela's aid,"" political analyst Somadoda Fikeni told CNN. ""The family is fragmented and recent squabbles over money have further emphasized these divisions."" Two of Nelson Mandela's daughters -- Makaziwe Mandela and Zenani Dlamini -- are currently embroiled in a legal battle over the former political prisoner's money. They have filed court papers in an attempt to remove Mandela's longtime lawyer and friend, 84-year-old George Bizos, and others as directors of companies owned by the Mandela Trust. The children's legal battle over their iconic father's monies has come under heavy criticism in South Africa. Bizos told local media the lawsuit is ""a ploy to resuscitate the sale of Mandela's artworks"" whose proceeds go to the companies at the center of the dispute. Andrew Mlangeni, who was incarcerated on Robben Island with Mr Mandela, told CNN: ""This is a matter that should have been resolved internally within the family."" Makaziwe recently rebutted accusations that her intentions are motivated by greed, telling the New York Times: ""This issue that we are greedy, that we are wanting this money before my dad passes away is all nonsense."" The feud over Nelson Mandela's millions and now the threat of an auction at his former wife's residence underscore the contradictions and complexities in what many consider South Africa's political ""royal family."" Read this: Big brands target South Africa's middle class . This is by no means Winnie Mandela's first brush with the law, although for years many saw her as untouchable. The former freedom fighter was implicated in the 1980s murder of 14-year-old anti-apartheid activist Stompie Seipei. Her then-husband, Nelson Mandela, stood by her, despite a mountain of damning evidence. In 1991 she was convicted of kidnapping Seipei and for being an accessory to assault, but her six-year jail term was reduced on appeal to a fine and a suspended sentence. In 2003 Mrs Mandela was convicted for theft and fraud in connection with an elaborate bank loan scheme where the ANC party letterhead was used to obtain loans for bogus employees including her youngest daughter Zinzi. The conviction carried a jail term, but that sentence too was suspended. A few months ago police confirmed that they have reopened the murder case of two more former freedom fighters, allegedly last seen at her house more than 20 years ago. Their bodies were exhumed in March. In recent years, ""the mother of the nation's"" influence in the country and within the ruling party has waned, and the protection she once enjoyed along with it. Last year she was voted second-last in the party's national executive committee. She had been top of the list at the previous ANC conference in 2007. Still, respected columnist and journalist Justice Malala says he is astonished Winnie Mandela couldn't get help from a single one of her former comrades. Malala told CNN: ""It's great that she was paying for her great niece's school fees but I'm surprised that firstly she didn't feel she could raise the money from her own salary and secondly that no-one in the ANC was willing to help her. She could have also approached the Mandela Trust. Mandela has given money to president Jacob Zuma before when he was in trouble."" Perhaps the most astonishing part of the tale is why her children and grandchildren appear to have stood by and watched as threats of an auction became more serious. Two of her grandchildren, Zaziwe and Swati Dlamini have recently launched a reality show in the U.S. called ""Being Mandela."" They also have a clothing line named ""Long Walk to Freedom"" after their grandfather's autobiography. Their mother Zenani Dlamini, Winnie's eldest daughter, is South Africa's ambassador to Argentina. Despite the family's many ventures and connections, Winnie's lawyer says money isn't always readily available. Winnie Mandela has often courted controversy, but she is still adored by many in South Africa. She endured years of torture, torment, banishment and imprisonment by the apartheid regime while fighting resolutely for racial equality in the country. And despite her legal and financial troubles over the years, very few South Africans are celebrating her downfall. Many of them took to Twitter to express their solidarity.

"(CNN) -- They're still massively undeveloped compared to their Thai neighbors, but Cambodia's islands are starting to get the attention they deserve. Whether you're looking for an all-night party or an underwater adventure among pristine coral reefs, Cambodia's got an island for all types and all budgets. Here are seven of the best. Best island for partying: Koh Rong . Not too long ago Koh Rong's only tourist amenities were a handful of bungalows besides miles of dense jungle and gorgeous white sand beaches. There's still amazing hiking and trekking on the island in the parts of the jungle that loggers haven't destroyed, but in the last few years dozens of cheap accommodations have been built and the place has become a backpacker Shangri-La. Though Koh Rong remains surprisingly undeveloped, at least by Thai island standards, its business owners are notoriously party-friendly, bringing in generators to keep the music going until the wee hours and offering live DJs and free-beer happy hours. A 24-hour bar and a permissive attitude towards ganja have made the island a go-to spot for sun burnt travelers who want to bake on the beach by day and get toasted by night. Getting there: High-speed ferries run from Sihanoukville (Speed Ferry Cambodia, Serendipity Beach Road, Sihanoukville, +855 34 934 744), which takes 50 minutes from shore and costs $15 return. In terms of accommodation, Vagabonds (+855 15 662 437, kohrongvagabonds@gmail.com) caters to the party set while Monkey Island (+855 81 830 991) and Paradise Bungalows (+855 92 548 883) are a quieter option. Best island for relaxing: Koh Rong Sanloem . Koh Rong Sanloem has long been a favorite of expats in Phnom Penh, who head to the quiet island for weekends at Lazy Beach, once the only accommodation option here. More recently, a dozen new places have sprung up on the opposite side of the island, Saracen Bay -- a heart-shaped inlet with calm turquoise surf and beautiful beaches. Fortunately the new businesses are determined to avoid the mistakes made on some of the neighboring islands and are promoting low-impact, sustainable tourism. The result is clean white sand beaches that visitors can have nearly all to themselves. There's not much to do on the island, but that's the point. Days can be spent paddle-boarding, snorkeling or relaxing under a palm tree with a good book. Getting there: From Sihanoukville, many of the Speed Ferry Cambodia ferries to Koh Rong also stop at Koh Rong Sanloem for $20 return. Accommodation options include Paradise Villas (+855 92 548 883), Saracen Bay Resort (+855 16 997 047) and Lazy Beach (+855 016 214 211). More: 12 stylish boutique hotels in Cambodia . Best island for luxury: Song Saa . The nickname of these two small private islands means ""sweethearts"" in Khmer. Fitting, as you'd have to be pretty sweet on someone to take them there, with villa prices topping $3,000 per night. The 27-room resort offers Cambodia's most exclusive island experience, starting with the bottle of champagne awaiting you at check-in. The champagne's included in the price and so is just about everything else, from the transfers from shore and the gourmet meals made from locally-sourced foods to the well-stocked mini-bar and free international calls from your villa. Even better, Song Saa is a model for sustainable development in Cambodia. The resort is helping the local community develop education and waste management programs and has embarked on several conservation efforts, including a marine reserve covering 50,000 square meters around the islands. Getting there: There are twice-daily speedboats to Song Saa (+855 236 860 360) from the Sihanoukville port that are free for guests, or private boats can be organized for $660 or helicopter for $1,320. Best island for nature watching: Koh Thmei . Located inside Ream National Park, Koh Thmei is home to monkeys, civets, lizards, more than 100 different species of birds and several threatened species, including the fishing cat, a wetland feline than makes its home near streams and mangrove forests. The island has only one place to stay, Koh Thmei Resort, and the term ""resort"" is used loosely: it's little more than nine simple wooden bungalows, but it's eco-friendly and solar powered. Guests can hike, bird watch, snorkel or take the two-person sea kayak out for a spin. The resort is even raising ponies that children can ride. There are nearby deserted beaches to visit with occasional views of dolphins swimming along the coast. Getting there: A taxi to Koh Kchhang, the fishing village closest to the island, from Phnom Penh costs $60, or $22 from Sihanoukville. Koh Thmei Resort (+855 97 737 0400) can organize a boat from Koh Kchhang for $12.50. Best island for meeting the green fairy: Koh Ta Kiev . The secluded beaches of Koh Ta Kiev are probably the last place you'd expect to find an absinthe bar, let alone a distillery. Yet this is where you'll find Syn Absinthe, a one-man operation that makes five types of hand-crafted, small-batch absinthe. Visitors can take a distillery tour that covers the entire process, from the wormwood that gives absinthe its reputed psychoactive properties to fermentation and bottling, plus the history of the oft-forbidden beverage. Tours end with a tasting that's served the traditional way, with a live flame, caramelized sugar and cold water. It's possible to visit the island just for the afternoon, but the gorgeous beaches also demand a couple of days' attention, as does the coconut bowling. Those who want to stay overnight can lodge in one of Ten103 Treehouse Bay's tree-top bungalows next to the distillery, but it's best to book in advance. Getting there: Syn Absinthe will be offering a daily boat, The Green Ferry, to the island specifically for tours the coming high season. (Syn Absinthe, +855 97 569 7614) Currently, there is a daily boat to Ten103 Treehouse Bay (+855 88 5044192) from Sihanoukville for $6.50 each way, or private day boats can be booked at local travel agencies, including Best Beach Travel (+855 15 678 924). Best island for diving: Koh Tang . Located about five hours from the mainland, Koh Tang was the site of a 1975 clash between U.S. forces and the Khmer Rouge, the last official battle of the Vietnam War. It's now uninhabited save for a small outpost of Cambodian military personnel, resulting in clear coastal waters with excellent visibility and undisturbed marine life, making it and nearby Koh Prins the perfect islands for diving. The island's eight popular diving sites offer coral reefs and a wealth of underwater creatures, including fantastically colored nudibranches, poisonous pufferfish and dazzling stingrays with electric blue spots. Getting there: Overnight diving trips can be booked to Koh Tang from Sihanoukville with Scuba Nation (+855 34 933 700) or The Dive Shop (+855 34 933 664). Best island for unplugging: Koh Totang . Koh Totang is the island of choice for those who want to totally disconnect from their regular life and do some serious beachcombing. The stunning island has just one place to stay, Nomad's Land, which has only five bungalows. Visitors will be forced to take a much-needed break from email because there's no Internet on Koh Totang. But because the bungalows are solar powered they don't have any noisy generators, either. Showers use saved rainwater, produce is grown in the permaculture garden and there's not much on the agenda other than lying in a hammock, enjoying the view and banishing all thought of life at home. Getting there: From Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville a taxi to Poi Yopon, the fishing village on the mainland, costs $100, or there's a bus from Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville to Andoung Teuk and then a local minibus from there. Nomad's Land (+855 11 916 171) will pick guests up by boat at Poi Yopon.

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Ten days after four Americans were killed in their Libyan city, hundreds marched in Benghazi and took over the headquarters of a radical Islamist group tied to the attack. Thousands of protesters had taken to the street earlier Friday, loudly declaring that they -- and not those behind last week's deadly attack -- represent the real sentiments of the Libyan people. ""I am sorry, America,"" one man said. ""This is the real Libya."" In the evening, an offshoot of several hundred people then headed toward the headquarters for Ansar al-Sharia, a loosely connected radical Islamist group. As militia members fled, the protesters torched a vehicle and took over the group's building without firing a single shot. Some of those involved claimed to have freed at least 20 captives held inside, and expressed their intent to assume control over other Ansar al-Sharia buildings. Army General Naji al-Shuaibi said the citizens, whom he referred to as ""revolutionaries of the February 17 uprising,"" later asked that the Ansar al-Sharia headquarters be handed over to the Libyan army. ""Indeed, we rushed here and we will now take it over,"" said the general. ""There are also other places that we intend to take over (which belong to armed groups) if the revolutionaries and the people allow us to do so."" But some of the protesters gathered at locations that house forces loyal to the national authority, he said, including the headquarters of the Rufallah al-Sihati battalion. Gunfire could be heard at the headquarters, but it was not initially clear who was responsible. Mohamed al-Magariaf, president of Libya's General National Congress, thanked the protesters for helping evict ""armed groups. He also said the Rufallah al-Sihati brigade was actually ""under the command of -- and committed to -- the national authority,"" the case appeared to be one of mistaken identity. Magariaf asked demonstrators to stop their activities and go home. There was widespread speculation that anti-national authority groups capitalized on the euphoria after the takeover of the Ansar al-Sharia headquarters and pushed protesters to move toward locations under the control of the army and the police force. On the night of September 11, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens was one of four Americans slain after a group assaulted the U.S. Consulate in the eastern Libyan city. Seen as the birthplace of the revolution that led to the death of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, Benghazi has in recent months been beset by security issues. Initial reports indicated that, ahead of the consular attack, Ansar al-Sharia had organized a protest to decry an inflammatory film that mocks the Prophet Mohammed and also protest the United States, where the film was privately produced. On Thursday, Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur said eight detained in connection with that assault include members of Ansar al-Sharia, though he added that not all the attackers came from one specific group. Responding to the report from Benghazi, U.S. Sen. John McCain applauded the citizens' efforts Friday and said it represented the true, freedom-loving Libya that he and other U.S. officials involved in the country knew. ""Somewhere Chris Stevens is smiling,"" the Arizona Republican said. ""This is what we knew ... about Libya.""","Protesters ask troops to take control of an Islamist group's HQ, a general says .

"London (CNN) -- British girl Madeleine McCann, who vanished during a 2007 family vacation in Portugal, may still be alive, UK authorities said Wednesday. Madeleine was a few days shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz as her parents dined in a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Despite a huge police investigation, massive coverage in the Portuguese and British media, and a public riveted on social media, she remains missing. London's Metropolitan Police on Wednesday released a new image of the girl created in collaboration with the family that shows how Madeleine might look at age 9. Her ninth birthday is May 12. Timeline of the case . An investigative review formed in May last year has been going through details from the case. ""As a result of evidence uncovered during the review, they now believe there is a possibility Madeleine is still alive and are appealing for anyone who is able to provide direct information as to her whereabouts to contact the team,"" police said in a statement, without disclosing any details on the possibility of new leads. Investigators are combing through about 100,000 pages of information for more details, authorities said. ""The intention is to identify from that material investigative opportunities which we will then present to the Portuguese authorities who retain primacy for the investigation,"" police said. ""Officers have so far identified around 195 such opportunities within the historic material, and are also developing what they believe to be genuinely new material."" Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading a team of more than 35 officers focused on the McCann case, said they ""will continue to put Madeleine McCann at the heart of everything we do."" Redwood has visited Portugal seven times since the disappearance and has regular contact with the girl's parents. The investigation is split equally down two lines -- one assuming that Madeleine is dead, the other that she is alive, police said. Since her disappearance, her parents have appealed for help and said there's a chance she may still be alive. Frequent reports of sightings of her in various parts of the world have sparked frenzies. Last year, a report of a girl bearing a resemblance to the child created a spike on social media. A spokesman for the girl's parents said the latest report is no more credible than other tips that proved incorrect over the years. Portuguese investigators closed the case in July 2008.","Madeleine McCann vanished during a 2007 family vacation in Portugal .

"(CNN) -- Chris and Leslie Creekmore have shared a married life for three and a half years. Earlier this month they shared symptoms of the flu: Aches, nausea, fever. He has fully recovered. She is on a ventilator, fighting for her life. Leslie Creekmore, 29, was 20 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to a hospital in Fort Smith, Arkansas, on January 11 because she was experiencing shortness of breath, her husband said. Her condition worsened; that night she was transferred to the intensive care unit. She was put on a ventilator on January 13. An emergency flight took her to Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis on January 14 where she remains on a ventilator, reported CNN affiliate KSDK. The couple's baby did not survive. Creekmore spontaneously miscarried on January 16, her husband said. Her right lung collapsed over the weekend, Chris Creekmore said. He agreed to let doctors at the hospital talk about the case. Dr. Rosanna Gray-Swain, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, who is not directly caring for Leslie Creekmore but is familiar with her case, said Creekmore remains unconscious. ""It's a little too early to tell what her outcome will be at this point,"" Gray-Swain said. Tuesday, Creekmore underwent surgery to receive a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, her husband said. ECMO is a therapy that provides heart-lung bypass support and circulates blood through an artificial lung back to the body. Chris Creekmore said one of the doctors told him it was a long shot, but the procedure went well, and she came out stable, he said. ""She's being cared for, and her status is still very, very tenuous,"" Gray-Swain said earlier Tuesday. ""If she had had the flu vaccine, she probably wouldn't be here in this state."" Chris Creekmore said he and his wife had researched tips for healthy pregnancies, and they had come across a recommendation to avoid the flu vaccine in the first trimester of pregnancy. He said he asked his wife's OB-GYN in Arkansas in October about the matter, and the doctor told them he was wary of giving flu shots during the first trimester. ""I for one don't count it as a screw-up on his end or anything like that,"" Chris Creekmore said of the doctor who advised delaying the flu shot. The couple did not know that this guidance runs counter to federal health recommendations. Any pregnant woman should get a flu shot to protect against serious complications as soon as the yearly vaccine becomes available in her area, advises the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website flu.gov. Women can receive the flu shot at any point during their pregnancies, regardless of trimester, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the CDC recommendation that all women get vaccinated if they will be pregnant during the influenza season: ""Vaccination early in the season and regardless of gestational age is optimal,"" ACOG says. Flu season may be heading toward peak . No harm has been demonstrated to pregnant women or their babies as a result of the vaccine, the CDC said. Barnes-Jewish Hospital used to recommend that women wait until after the first trimester of pregnancy to receive a flu shot, too, Gray-Swain said. But that policy changed four years ago with emerging evidence that the vaccine was safe for all pregnant women. The flu vaccine protects against many strains during the season from October to March. Pregnant women who receive the vaccine may still get the flu, but it would likely be a milder illness than otherwise, and severe consequences would be improbable, Gray-Swain said. A national effort to prevent the 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of pregnant women who receive flu vaccines, according to the CDC. Less than 15% of pregnant women received a flu shot before 2009; in the next two seasons, more than half of pregnant women got the vaccine protection. Some states hit harder by flu this year . The flu may increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight, the CDC said. ""Pregnancy puts extra stress on your heart and lungs. Pregnancy can also affect your immune system. These factors increase the risk of becoming severely ill due to the flu,"" according to the CDC website. Life-threatening developments like Creekmore's in flu patients are generally rare but not unheard of, Gray-Swain said. ""Pregnant women are five times more likely to end up in the ICU or have severe complications related to the flu than non-pregnant women who get infected with the flu,"" she said. The flu vaccine that is safe for pregnant woman is in injectable form, and it does not contain the live virus, Gray-Swain said. The nasal spray versions should not be given to pregnant women. If you are pregnant, inform the health care staff administering the vaccine before you receive it. Washing your hands after using the bathroom, touching public surfaces and other activities is also important, she said. Pregnant women can also take a drug called Tamiflu. It is most commonly taken to reduce the length of symptoms, but it is also given to people with high-risk flu exposure as a prevention. The Creekmores had planned to call the baby Jera, KSDK reported. The baby was ""too young to be able to be resuscitated,"" Gray-Swain said. She was a ""far too young, far too tiny, but beautifully structured, almost-baby girl,"" Chris Creekmore said. His wife was unconscious during the miscarriage. ""She wanted to know the gender as bad as me,"" Chris Creekmore said, ""but I don't know how -- how in the hell -- I'm going to, when she wakes up, tell her what's going on."" Chris Creekmore's friend set up a GoFundMe page to help the family raise money to support Leslie's care. The response is far greater than Chris Creekmore expected. He thought the page might generate gas money for hospital visits. Now, donations are in the thousands of dollars. If there is money left over from the campaign after he pays his wife's medical bills, Chris Creekmore wants to use the extra funds to help his sister's child, who has a medical condition, and to help support free flu vaccination clinics. His public message is: Vaccinate yourself against the flu. Leslie had planned to get a flu shot at a clinic on January 13, the same doctor's visit as her 20-week ultrasound, her husband said. It would have been the same day that she was placed on the ventilator. Facebook page for support for Leslie Creekmore .

"(CNN) -- Tunisian prosecutors say they'll seek a death sentence for former President Zine El Abedine Ben Ali, now charged in absentia with ordering the killings of anti-government demonstrators. Ben Ali has remained in exile in Saudi Arabia since the January 2011 uprising that forced him from office. He is being tried in absentia in the deaths of dozens of anti-government protesters during the revolt, and the state news agency Tunis Afrique Presse reported Wednesday that prosecutors asked a court to impose a death sentence in his case. In addition, the prosecutor's office said former Interior Minister Rafik Kacem and dozens of other former officials now awaiting a military court's verdict should get the ""maximum"" sentence short of death, according to TAP. Ben Ali already has been convicted in absentia and sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a 1991 case in which 17 servicemen were accused of plotting a coup against his regime. Tunisia's revolt touched off the Arab Spring movements in several other countries that ultimately toppled three other longtime Arab rulers. One of those, former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also faces a possible death sentence on charges he ordered police to fire on demonstrators who demanded his ouster, but lawyers familiar with the case have said it was unlikely the ailing Mubarak would have to face the gallows. Journalist Houda Zaghdoudi contributed to this report for CNN.","Ben Ali has been in exile in Saudi Arabia since his overthrow .

"(CNN) -- The creators of an app that helps people send anonymous emails are coming under fire for a PR stunt that didn't quite go as planned. Over the last couple days, Leak, a new service that allows people to send anonymous emails, sent a number of reporters questionable emails as part of a push to promote the app. An email sent via Leak to a Mashable reporter: ""Dear neighbors, would you mind stop (sic) walking naked at home? We can see you every morning when having breakfast. From someone, anonymously. Sent from Leak."" SEE ALSO: The Beginner's Guide to Whisper . Emails sent to Mashable, as well as reporters from other publications, ranged from nonsensical to more than a little creepy. Leak cofounder Laurent Desserrey confirmed to Mashable the emails were sent to reporters as part of a PR push. ""We decided to send them to some journalists we liked thinking that it was funnier to live the Leak experience than receiving a regular press release,"" Desserrey wrote in an email. He did, however, acknowledge the company may have been a bit ""clumsy"" in its attempts. The app launched last week. Desserrey, who is based in Paris, says it was created in a single weekend with the help of his friend and cofounder Sebastien Thiriet. In a post on Medium Desserrey explains he was inspired by apps such as Secret which encourage anonymous sharing. ""I heard about Secret and started to use it,"" he wrote. ""I loved it and enjoyed the excitement of sharing for the first time my secret garden with everyone. But there is no Secret community in Paris yet, so the experience was a bit frustrating."" While some apps that encourage anonymous sharing have gotten flack for their potential to enable bullying and other negative interactions, Desserrey says he wants Leak to be used for good. ""We wanted Leak to be a really positive and exciting tool,"" he says. ""It's sure that people can send negative leaks, but that is really not what the product is about. It's about saying the truth you're ashamed to say. And if it's getting negative you can block emails from Leak.""

"(CNN) -- A Liberian doctor who received the same Ebola experimental treatment as two Americans has died, officials said. Dr. Abrahim Borbor died Sunday evening after contracting Ebola at a hospital in Monrovia, officials at a treatment facility in the Liberian capital said. Borbor used ZMapp, the same drug given to two Americans who had Ebola. The Democratic Republic of Congo is also reporting new Ebola cases in a northern town, sparking fears that the deadly virus is expanding far beyond West Africa. Two people in Gera tested positive for Ebola, a government spokesman said Sunday. The country's health minister confirmed the cases in a televised statement. ""We're going to provide essential medication in all medical institutions in the area of Gera but also free health treatment for the duration of the epidemic,"" Felix Kabange Numbi said. A lab and quarantine station have been set up in the town, which is about 750 miles from the capital of Kinshasa. The central African nation said its test showed that the strain is different from the one that has killed nearly 1,500 people in the West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. ""This epidemic doesn't have any link to that which is now happening in West Africa,"" Numbi said. There are five identified strains of the Ebola virus; four are known to cause infections in humans: Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and TaÃ¯ Forest ebolavirus. The World Health Organization said the agency's lab is conducting its own confirmation testing that will also determine the strain of the virus found. Experts have described the West African outbreak as the worst in the history of the virus. Ebola first appeared in 1976 in Sudan and Congo, and takes its name from a river in the latter nation. Congo has had six previous outbreaks since the disease appeared on its shores, the World Health Organization said. Africa has been limited to three strains: Bundibugyo, Sudan and Zaire. Last week, 13 people died of a mysterious ailment in the Boende area in Congo, but the WHO said at the time that their deaths were a result of a ""viral hemorrhagic fever of undetermined origin."" Ebola is one of the world's most virulent diseases and is transmitted through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of infected people. The outbreak has forced various nations to take drastic action, including Ivory Coast, which said it is closing borders it shares with Guinea and Liberia for an indefinite period. Senegal also closed its borders over Ebola fears. The closure includes any aircraft and ships traveling to Senegal from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. A major outbreak in Congo would be catastrophic; it shares borders with nine nations, including Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. Borders closing over Ebola fears .

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- This week, there was a massive attempt to gate-crash on the U.S.-Mexico border, part of the ""Bring Them Home"" campaign. A better name for it would be ""Operation Return to Sender."" About 30 young immigrant deportees, intent on re-entering the United States from Mexico to rejoin families or resume their lives, tried to cross the border. Donning caps and gowns or wearing T-shirts that read: ""I Am Undocumented,"" they politely presented themselves to U.S. border agents to ask for asylum -- and essentially dared the authorities to make a federal case out of it. They were quickly apprehended and shuttled away. And -- like the Malaysian jetliner that disappeared -- they haven't been seen since. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents said privacy laws prohibit them from revealing what happened to the uninvited guests. If you think that's the real reason for their silence, I have eight Southwestern states that used to belong to Mexico that I'd like to sell you. The real reason the agency is keeping quiet is politics. No matter what the administration does with those it apprehended, it is going to catch heat. If it lets them stay in the United States to pursue asylum claims, as it did with others who entered the country in similar fashion last year, the right wing will be upset. If it simply deports the immigrants back to Mexico, or locks them up in a detention facility, the left wing is likely to rise up. As it is, many immigration activists at the grass-roots level have had their fill of this administration and its political games. They're frustrated because President Obama broke his promise to Latino voters to make immigration overhaul a top priority; because he seems to think flowery words are just as good as decisive action; and because he is better at removing the undocumented than at finding ways for them to stay in the United States. This month, Obama is expected to reach a dubious milestone: the 2 millionth deportation under his watch. Obama's administration, with its highly aggressive Department of Homeland Security, expanded a program called Secure Communities, which ropes local police officers into enforcing federal immigration law, Arizona-style. The administration has deported more people than the population of Nebraska. Along the way, as collateral damage, it has also destroyed hundreds of thousands of families. That is part of what this protest at the border was all about. Some of those who were removed have refused to take ""go"" for an answer. Perhaps they took the President at his word when he promised to use his executive power to get things done if Congress refused to act. Apparently, those ""things"" don't include something that clearly falls into the purview of the executive branch: stopping deportations. Or perhaps they bought into his rhetoric about how undocumented young people who were raised in the United States are Americans in every way except legal status. If that's true, why can't they come home? Obama has made hash out of his immigration policy by pretending to be lenient toward illegal immigrants while dropping the hammer on them. He can be a nice guy, or a tough guy, but not both. He should pick one and stick to it. That's why the administration -- and its defenders in the self-serving Washington-based immigration lobby -- would like to ignore what happened this week on the border. Every time an immigration activist turns down the rhetorical crumbs offered by this administration and demands something more substantial, it reveals that, on the immigration issue, liberals aren't as liberal as they like to think. It's one thing to say that the system is broken and needs to be fixed so that our borders are secure and people who want to come here legally can do so more quickly and efficiently. It's another to go to bat for those who have been deported. Because these folks were here illegally, it's easy to argue that they got what they deserved. Yet, what should worry Americans is that -- in a misguided attempt to ease the pressure that working-class Americans feel from competing for jobs with illegal immigrants -- Obama has used the heavy club of a powerful agency that was designed to fight terrorism. The administration is seeking, in the 2015 fiscal year, a staggering $38.2 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for a ""continued commitment to the security of our homeland and the American public."" This, to uproot 2 million people who pose no threat to the homeland or the public. For years, U.S. authorities would use their discretion to keep immigrants out of removal proceedings: battered wives who went to police for help, tamale vendors who gathered outside grocery stores, people with green card applications pending, children with U.S.-born relatives. These are the people being deported. Those 2 million deportations also include classes of people that Obama has routinely said will not be deported, such as Dreamers -- those undocumented young people who were brought here as children -- and parents with U.S.-born children. The days of common sense immigration enforcement are over. In the last five years, it's all been about driving up the numbers by any means necessary. It worked. The damage is done. We'll be suffering the aftershocks for generations to come. That's what the protesters on the border were trying to tell us. We need to listen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","About 30 deportees in Mexico went to U.S. border to try to re-enter as a protest .

"(CNN) -- The amazing discoveries from NASA's Kepler planet-hunting space telescope keep rolling in. The latest, announced this week by astronomers, is the discovery of a planet just 10% larger than the Earth orbiting in the so-called ""habitable zone"" of the star Kepler-186. In our solar system, Earth is the only planet in the habitable zone -- the distance from the sun where liquid water can exist on the surface without boiling away (like on Venus), or turning to ice (like on Mars). The new planet, imaginatively dubbed Kepler-186f for now, appears to be in the same kind of Goldilocks place in its solar system. Not too hot, not too cold, just right. 186f could be the closest planet yet found. It could be Earth 2.0. Maybe. The Kepler telescope can detect planets like 186f and tell us their size, but it can't tell us what they're made of or what they're like. Is 186f a rocky planet like the Earth with a thin atmosphere and oceans and continents? Or does it have a thick atmosphere and a small rocky core? Or is it a big metallic body with no atmosphere at all? Or something else entirely? Over the past decade a veritable zoo of planets has been discovered around other stars using a variety of telescopic methods, from hot Jupiters (giant planets close in to their star) to super Earths (rocky worlds many times the size of our planet). Add to that the amazing diversity of planets and moons that we've discovered right here in our own solar system during the past four decades from the Voyager spacecraft and other missions, the variety is astounding. Even if 186f doesn't turn out to be Earth-like, the number of actual Earth-like extrasolar planets out there appears to be staggering. During its four-year mission, Kepler observed just a tiny, random, average piece of the sky, one you would cover with your fist held at arm's length. More than 1,000 planets have been discovered so far from just the nearby stars in that tiny patch of the sky. 186f, for example, is ""just"" 500 light years away -- a veritable next-door neighbor on the galactic scale. If you extend the results of that little survey across the entire, 100,000-light-year-wide Milky Way galaxy, you end up concluding that there are likely to be tens of billions of Earth-sized planets in our galaxy alone. And many of them must be orbiting in their sun's habitable zones as well. Astronomers are scrambling to use other telescopes, on the ground and in space, to try to figure out what 186f and the thousand other new worlds discovered so far are really like. And new space observatories are being planned to try to follow up and expand on the results from the Kepler mission (which stopped collecting new planet data last year). The implications of what they find could be profound, especially if they're able to detect an atmosphere there, and -- the Holy Grail -- especially if that atmosphere contains telltale gases like water vapor, oxygen, or methane, key indicators that the place may be habitable. Just because a planet is in a star's habitable zone, though, and just because it has an environment that is potentially habitable, doesn't mean that planet is necessarily inhabited. But there are astronomers looking out for that possibility, too. It's no coincidence, for example, that the lead author of the study that discovered 186f, Dr. Elisa Quintana, is from a research organization called the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, or SETI, institute. I'm sure other SETI astronomers are making extra efforts to train their radio telescopes on Kepler-186 and those other recently discovered exoplanet systems, to listen for any stray signals. Or, perhaps, they'll find a targeted signal, a cosmic ""hello?"" beamed our way by our neighboring astronomers on 186f, who are also trying desperately to answer the question, ""Are we alone?""","NASA's Kepler telescope discovered a planet that is 10% larger than Earth .

"(CNN) -- There was a time when few travelers visited Colombia, when the country was synonymous with drug lords, when the only English you heard on the streets was spoken by American Marines. That Colombia -- a country of conflict and cartels -- has largely disappeared, replaced by a rejuvenated capital of Bogota and a resilient culture that refuses to be bogged down by the dark days. Premonitions and stereotypes should be swept aside before visiting this South American country of spectacular scenery. Today's Colombia is much more than the ugly Escobar legacy or its famed Andean coffee -- though a cup of cafÃ© will most certainly reach your hands during a trip. 5 luxury vacations in Chile . Here are some important things to keep in mind before visiting the country with the third-largest Spanish-speaking population in the world (about 46 million), after Mexico and Spain. 1. Medellin is the world's most innovative city, officially . Jutting out of a mountainside packed with russet cinder-block slums, the three black shards of Medellin's Espana Library stand out in a sea of shanties. Completed in 2007, the Espana Library has become a calling card for the revitalized city, just one of the examples that led the Washington-based Urban Land Institute to name it the 2012 ""Innovative City of the Year"" in a competition co-sponsored by the Wall Street Journal and Citi. Zipping up to connect the library and surrounding area to the city is the MetroCable, a novel approach to addressing poverty at the grass-roots level. ""Medellin is a city that works hard to tell the world of its capabilities and broadcast its impressive tourism opportunities,"" said Maria Claudia Lacouture, president of trade group Proexport Colombia. 2. Drug culture stereotypes are false and offensive . Drop your ideas of a coke-soaked land still lost in the days of the Escobar gang. While residents of Medellin can recall growing up in a battlefield, where even trips to buy groceries meant dodging violence, Colombia is no gangster's paradise. The coca leaf is still chewed in some rural communities, and coca leaf tea is stocked for tourists, but suggesting that Colombia hasn't moved on from its inglorious past is considered ignorant and rude. Colombia has persevered, though unfortunately so has the drug war, migrating closer to its end market -- the U.S.-Mexico border. 7 luxury vacations in Mexico . 3. Bogota must be seen from Monserrate . Every big city has a perfect vantage point from which to appreciate its immensity. For Bogota, that magic spot is Monserrate. Perched on a mountain dominating the city, Monserrate is home to a church where pilgrims visit a shrine devoted to El Senor Caido (Fallen Lord). From the summit, Bogota's vast gray and red concrete expanse absorbs the green valley that frames it; the sight puts the sprawling proportion of this megacity into perspective. Monserrate can be reached via an aerial tramway, funicular or by climbing on foot. 4. Security has dramatically improved . Since controversial policies implemented in 2006 by former President Alvaro Uribe encouraged paramilitary groups to ""demobilize"" after their conflict with communist guerillas, Colombia's security situation has vastly improved. The country's new image has led to a rise in tourism, with bus trips (albeit on select routes) now considered safe for foreigners. It's common to see military personnel at checkpoints outside cities, but this is once again an improvement that represents the government's control of the country. 5. Real Colombians drink cafe tinto . Colombia is synonymous with coffee, so it's little surprise that the morning beverage is in such high demand that leagues of women walk Colombian cities serving it. At first glance, these women may appear equipped to snuff out pests, but their mobile packs aren't meant for exterminating bugs, they're meant for pouring hot coffee. A real Colombian, you'll inevitably be told, takes the stuff black, or cafe tinto. Insider Guide: Best of Cancun . 6. Salsatecas are best when hot and sweaty . What's Colombia without salsa? Not Colombia. Beginners can take salsa classes to get familiar with the basic steps. Those who can't be bothered with formal lessons will find Colombians to be warm people, even warmer when dancing. Most will be happy to show you some introductory moves on the spot if you're charming enough. 7. Pueblitos are favored weekend destinations . Pueblitos, or small villages, dot the Colombian countryside, serving up a colonial past and antiquated charm not found in cities. From almost every major Colombian urban hub, pueblitos can be accessed via road, making for easy weekend trips. Outside Bogota, Guatavita is a small town near Guatavita Lake that offers idyllic views of casitas, the small houses that exemplify Colombia's countryside. 8. Nothing is more Colombian than aguardiente . If you're looking for a stiff drink, a $6 bottle of aguardiente is the most Colombian way to find it. All departments (administrative regions) in Colombia have license to produce their own aguardiente, a 60%-alcohol spirit that means ""fiery water."" There's no Colombian celebration without aguardiente. Even more local? The unforgettable guayabo (Colombian slang for hangover) de aguardiente. Insider Guide: Best of Mexico City . 9. Colombian climates vary wildly . Colombia may straddle the equator, but that doesn't mean you should leave your gloves and sweater at home. Bogota and Medellin are in tropical highlands and can get chilly at night -- especially Bogota, where heavy jackets and scarves are the norm year-round. Visit the coast around Cartagena, however, and you'll be sweltering. This climatic disparity is reflected in Colombia's cultural composition. Locals come in as many varieties as the weather; there's no one look for a Colombian. 10. Cali is Salsa City . The gravity-defying female assets of Cali's nightclubs thrust out to such fierce degree that they can't be overlooked -- the sultry salsa city is renowned for its talent-laden, sexually dynamic dance floors. Those seeking a more subtle experience can start with a viejoteca, where there's more actual dancing, less physical drama and fewer crazy drinkers.

"(CNN) -- For Christians, the wild celebrations of Mardi Gras come before the solemnity of Lent, a last chance to celebrate before the abstinence marking the 40 days to Good Friday and Easter. Muslims do it the other way around. First comes the month of daytime fasting during Ramadan, then the eruption of joy called Eid al-Fitr, marked with gift-giving, new clothes, donations to the poor, feasting and festivities. But as the sighting of a crescent moon officially marked the beginning of Eid on Tuesday, feelings are decidedly mixed for many Muslims. There's joy tempered with concern on Tahrir Square in Egypt, which saw a successful revolution topple President Hosni Mubarak this year. And there's optimism in Libya, where 42 years of rule by Moammar Gadhafi seem to be coming to an end. But emotions are much more muted in Syria, where the government is clamping down to prevent the Arab Spring from spreading, and there is a sense of gloom in Pakistan, wracked by violence and natural disasters. Egypt . Egyptians are putting a revolutionary twist on the traditional Eid greeting ""Eid Mubarak,"" meaning ""a blessed Eid,"" said engineering student Abdulrahman Khedr. ""People are saying to each other 'Eid Mubarak without Mubarak,'"" he said. Salma Hegab, an Egyptian student at the American University in Cairo, marked Eid in Tahrir Square, the symbolic center of the February revolution. ""It was awesome seeing the Egyptian revolutionaries again with the same determination and enthusiasm,"" she said. But she noticed with some concern that the long-suppressed Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood -- which has emerged as a major force -- was absent from the square. She was struck by a puppet show Brotherhood supporters performed for children in one neighborhood. It was ""full of political implications,"" she said. Traditionally, Eid prayers are a communal affair -- held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques. But in the small village of Menofia, outside Cairo, the imam expressed concern the Muslim Brotherhood held its prayers separately, said Raghda Elkattan. The imam ""mentioned that Islam should not be represented by the various views that started to take a political role in society,"" said the medical student at Cairo University. ""My father talked with the imam who said that he meant to give this kind of speech because he didn't like how the Islamic groups are so many and different."" Libya . Tripoli residents rang in the end of Ramadan with celebratory gunfire. It was ""two times the celebration and two times the joy,"" said medical student Khiria El-Feghi. ""I remember celebrating Eid for the last couple of years in Libya,"" she said. ""People seemed to be happy that it was Eid, but I never saw this happiness deep in their eyes; I felt like there was a sadness deep down."" But this year was different, she said. While Libyans mourned those who died battling the regime of Moammar Gadhafi, a sense of hope permeated throughout. ""When a nation wants something so badly, they will make sure that they get it; even if means lots of death,"" she said. ""Never underestimate the ability of a nation."" Syria . Celebrations were in short supply in Syria where pro-reform demonstrators took to the streets after Eid prayers and were met by brute force, opposition activists said. Security forces violently broke up rallies in Daraa, Damascus and Homs, activists said. ""There will be no happiness while the martyrs' blood is still warm,"" said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an activist group. In Daraa, a focal point in the nationwide wave of anti-government rage, Abu Abdu's three young children asked him, ""Where are our new Eid clothes and sweets?"" ""Just pray to God,"" he replied. ""All we're going to do is visit the cemetery -- that's our Eid,"" he said. Pakistan . Many residents of Pakistan said they are finding little to cheer about this holiday. In Karachi, where ongoing rivalries between three political parties vying for power have left dozens dead, Faisal Kapadia said Eid this year is a ""hollow one."" ""Never have I felt the apathy and sadness I feel now at the death of so many of my brothers and sisters in this last month,"" said Kapadia, a writer and entrepreneur in Pakistan's largest city. Elsewhere in the country, rain-triggered flash floods have ruined crops and destroyed lives. ""I know for a fact that this city and nation are amongst the most resilient on earth,"" Kapadia said. ""But even we cannot just keep getting up from blow after blow of this magnitude."" Zubaida Khan, a teacher in the capital, Islamabad, was envious of the protests sweeping throughout the Middle East. ""We hate the rulers that have hijacked our country,"" she said. ""We would love to have regime change in Pakistan, just like in Libya and Egypt."" But she wasn't optimistic: ""I don't think this Eid will bring about any positive change for Pakistan's future."" However, the Arab Spring revolts have left many Muslims with a distinct optimism about the future. That's a marked change from the decades when Arabs living under autocratic rulers would bitterly quote a verse by Iraqi-born poet Abu Tayeb Al-Mutanabbi asking if Eid will ""be the same and even more sorrow, or will you be the sign of a new day?"" For years, many Arabs assumed the answer was more sorrow. But this year, many are saying Arabs should be proud of what they have accomplished since the last Eid -- and they hold out hope for even more happiness by the next one. CNN's Saad Abedine, Reza Sayah and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Tuesday marks the first Eid al-Fitr since the Arab Spring .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A series of bombings in Iraq, just before a major Muslim holiday, killed at least six people and wounded 44 others on Thursday. The two deadliest attacks Thursday were in the towns of Iskandariya and Yousifiya, south of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. Two bombs detonated in quick succession about 11 a.m. at a busy marketplace in Iskandariya, killing at least two people and wounding 28 others, including children, the official said. Iskandariya, part of Babil province, is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Baghdad. In the second attack, a parked car bomb exploded at a taxi and bus stop in Yousifiya. The blast killed at least two people and wounded 10 others, the official said. As Iraqis prepare to celebrate the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, public places like markets are packed with shoppers. In Baghdad, three bombs attached to civilian vehicles caused casualties. One of the bombs detonated on a highway in eastern Baghdad, killing the driver in the car and wounding two civilian bystanders.

"(CNN) -- Sporting a black t-shirt proudly proclaiming ""Live 2 Break,"" a group of grinning boys form a slightly jagged circle inside a dusty yard on the outskirts of Kigali, Rwanda's capital. Inside the circle a bandana-wearing dance instructor spins from his back onto his chest flaring his legs high in the air in a V-shape. The boys respond to his virtuoso dance moves with claps and cheers before taking to the floor themselves, twisting and turning as they try to perfect their breakdance moves. They are part of an uplifting dance project at Les Enfants De Dieu, a residential care center working to transform the lives of former street children in Rwanda. The center accommodates 126 boys aged six to 18 who, apart from their tough upbringing, share a deep passion for an art form that also originated in the streets: Hip-hop. ""Once their basic needs are fulfilled, they need to nourish their spirit, their self-esteem and their pride in themselves,"" says Nicola Triscott, co-founder of Catalyst Rwanda, a UK-based group that organizes art programs for vulnerable youth. ""I think hip-hop really helps to do that, because it's such a young person's art form -- it came off the streets and it's about one-on-one teaching. There's this great spirit of sharing in hip hop,"" she adds. Read more: Film pioneer helps Rwanda build new identitys . Last year, Catalyst Rwanda responded to the kids' wish to learn how to ""break"" -- hip-hop's original dance form -- by taking legendary British breaker Pervez to the tiny African country. The project was an instant success: For 10 days, the center's courtyards were turned into makeshift dance floors as Pervez taught the children how to develop their breaking skills and allowed them to express themselves. ""I remember the first day when the people came here to teach them how to dance hip-hop, I was really, myself, in heaven,"" says Rafiki Callixte, 43, project manager at the center. He says the children were living a tough, hopeless life in the streets. They had no time to laugh or relax as they always had to take care of themselves. Their story has been immortalized in ""Yes, Man!"" a short documentary film screening Thursday at the Africa Utopia festival in London. ""Now, to see them smiling, without stress, (being) enthusiastic, open, very active and then seeing also some children around appreciating the ones who were dancing, you could understand how dancing is helping them to come out of themselves, to express their inner harmony, their inner happiness and forget the hard life they have experienced."" Old friends meet again . It all began after Triscott received a Facebook message from Callixte in 2010, asking her if she still remembered him. The two had met in the early 1990s in Rwanda when Nicola was traveling across Africa. They became friends and stayed in touch via mail but in 1994, as Rwanda was being torn apart by genocide, their communication broke down. Triscott knew that Callixte was in danger and assumed that he had died, as he hadn't replied to the last letter she sent him in 1994. Callixte was alive and had only lost her address. He had been a teacher before the war, and in the years after the genocide, he embarked on a mission to help his country's vulnerable street children, including those orphaned by the genocide and by HIV/AIDS.

It was while in Kigali that she discovered his inspiring work at the center's children. ""I thought they were an extraordinary group of young men,"" remembers Triscott, 47, who noticed ""how much they loved hip hop,"" so she asked them if there was anything she could do to help. ""We'd really like proper hip-hop dance lessons,"" the boys told Triscott, prompting her to return to Rwanda with Pervez last November. Genocide aftermath . In Rwanda, where 800,000 people died in just 100 days during the 1994 genocide , nearly 43% of the population are children up to 14 years old. An estimated one million orphans and ""other vulnerable children"" live in the country, according to UNICEF. Les Enfants De Dieu says that communities are not often able to deal with the direct and indirect effects of the genocide, leading to thousands of children taking to the streets. Many of them suffer from neglect and abuse, while others resort to drug use. The center, which was founded in 2002, provides the boys with food, a place to sleep and healthcare. It also offers sports training, as well as education at school and vocational training at various centers -- all part of efforts to help the children remove the trauma of street life through rehabilitation. Ultimately, the center's goal is to reintegrate the children into the society once they are entirely rehabilitated. ""Children of the street are children like the others,"" says former street kid Willy in ""Yes, Man!"" ""When they get love, they are children like the others. So, when they get someone who helps them, who takes care of them, they will become a real man,"" adds Willy, 18, who spent four and a half years on the street before going to live at Les Enfants De Dieu. Catalyst Rwanda is planning to bring more professional hip-hop dancers to Rwanda this year to show the children more moves and boost their confidence. Callixte says dancing has given hope back to the children, prompting some to even start composing their own songs. ""They love hip hop so much. Now, many of them are dancing to songs they have made themselves."" He says this is only the beginning. ""When you see them dancing, when you see them smiling, when you see them expressing themselves, when you see them appreciating each other ... you can never think about stopping that project.""","Les Enfants De Dieu is a care center that gives food and shelter to street kids in Kigali, Rwanda .

"(CNN) -- Giancarlo Stanton of the Miami Marlins -- a contender for the National League's most valuable player award -- will apparently sit out the rest of the season after a pitched ball struck him in the face. The impact shattered bones and caused tooth damage, according to the team. The ball, thrown by Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Mike Fiers, hit Stanton during an at-bat in the fifth inning of Thursday night's game in Milwaukee. It appeared to strike him on the left cheek, just below his eye. Stanton fell to the ground, bleeding, and was taken from the field on a stretcher. The team later said on Twitter he'd suffered facial cuts, broken bones and tooth damage. Marlins manager Mike Redmond said Stanton would be out for the rest of the year. ""It's devastating for us. Devastating,"" he told reporters in a Fox Sports Florida video posted on the team's website. ""I mean, for his season to end like that, that's not good.""

"(CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president tapped Al-Baji Qa'ed Al-Sebsi as the country's new prime minister Sunday, after the previous prime minister resigned amid protests, state-run media reported. Former Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi's resignation Sunday came a day after three people were killed during protests in the capital, Tunis. ""I am resigning today because I am not willing to be a person that takes decisions that could cause casualties,"" he told reporters Sunday. He also questioned ""why a lot of people considered their main target to keep attacking the government, although a lot of its members agreed to join in this critical time."" Three people were killed Saturday and nine others injured during mayhem in Tunis, according to an Interior Ministry statement cited by the state-run news agency, Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP). More than 100 people were arrested in the area around Habib Bourguiba Avenue, in the city's center, and accused of ""acts of destruction and burning,"" the ministry said. Protesters had gathered in the area to demand that the interim government step down and the current parliament be disbanded. Demonstrators were also asking for suspension of the current constitution and the election of an assembly that can write a new one, as well as organize the transition to democracy. Protests in Tunisia erupted late last year. Fed up with corruption, unemployment and escalating prices of food, people began demonstrating en masse after the self-immolation suicide of a fruit cart vendor in December. By January 13, Ben Ali -- who had ruled Tunisia since 1987 -- turned executive power over to his prime minister and fled the country.","NEW: Interim president chooses new prime minister .

"(CNN) -- In The World According to Dennis Rodman, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whom he just saw on his second trip to the country, is quite likable. ""He has to do his job, but he's a very good guy,"" Rodman said Monday at a news conference, announcing plans for a ""basketball diplomacy"" event that will involve players from North Korea. Meanwhile, Kim presides over one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. As Human Rights Watch puts it, Kim's succession as supreme leader after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011, ""had little impact on the country's dire human rights record."" People are subjected to torture and thrown into prison camps based on political charges. Those who have managed to escape describe horror that includes beatings, starvation and executions. As CNN has reported, Kim Jong Un appears to have changed nothing in the camps. U.S. citizen Kenneth Bae knows first-hand.  He's currently in one, charged with ""serious crimes"" and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly trying to bring down the government through religious activities. Bae's family says he owned a tour company and was in North Korea for work. The accusations against him were spelled out on state-run media, which is the only kind of media that ""very good guy"" Kim Jong Un and his country allow. Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . Par for the course in North Korea, where people have no freedom. In 2012, ""Defectors continued to report extrajudicial killings, disappearances, arbitrary detention, arrests of political prisoners, and torture,"" the U.S. State Department Human Rights Report says. ""The judiciary was not independent and did not provide fair trials. There continued to be reports of severe punishment of some repatriated refugees and their family members. There were reports of trafficked women among refugees and workers crossing the border into China. ""The government made no known attempts to prosecute officials who committed human rights abuses."" Meanwhile, much of the country starves. More than 25% of North Korean children under the age of 5 suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2012, according to the National Nutrition Survey of North Korea, a report backed by UNICEF, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. The report also found nearly one in three women suffered from anemia. The North Korea we rarely see . Rodman: Come with me . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, journalists would realize that his rosy description of Kim is really the right one, if only they'd go over there and see for themselves. ""You write what you hear, but you don't see what you write,"" Rodman complained, saying he wants to bring a journalist on one of his trips to visit his friend. Yes, that's the problem, Mr. Rodman. North Korea is aching for journalists to roam freely around the country and report to the world what things are really like. ""My military minder tells me to turn my camera off, and it soon becomes clear why,"" CNN's Paula Hancocks wrote last month on a trip to the ""hermit kingdom."" ""The poverty I see through the bus window is not the view of North Korea the regime wants to be seen. ... Buildings are in disrepair; some barely look inhabitable. Residents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road, many seeming to have little to do. A number of official-looking men dressed in brown Mao suits stand silently on street corners. ... Despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas, you could still sense the local community being monitored."" ""It was a tightly restricted, carefully stage-managed tour rich with propaganda and political theater and little else,"" CNN's Ivan Watson wrote in July of his five-day trip to Pyongyang. ""It offered virtually no insight into what life is like for ordinary citizens who live in this rigid dictatorship."" ""We were not allowed to leave the confines of the Yanggakdo International Hotel unless we were riding a government bus. During my five days in North Korea, the authorities did not even allow me to see what the country's currency looks like."" ""Our three-man crew was assigned two very polite minders who accompanied us everywhere outside of the hotel and made no secret about the fact that they had veto rights if we were to take pictures of something that they didn't approve of,"" he added on CNN's GPS blog. ""So they would basically tell us what we could and could not take pictures of."" Rodman: Kim just wants to talk . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim Jong Un just wants to talk. ""It's about trying to open Obama's and everyone's minds,"" he said Monday, aiming some of his remarks at the U.S. president. ""You don't have to talk about politics. ... Meet him or even give him a call. That's all he wants."" Meanwhile, Kim might be even more bellicose than his father was. On CNN's GPS blog, three analysts say an analysis of language used in the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency ""shows the use of terms such as 'war' and 'nuclear' far more prevalent than terms such as 'peace' and 'reconciliation.' "" A U.S. defense official said North Korea has been using ""warmongering rhetoric."" Rodman: I held Kim's daughter . In The World According to Dennis Rodman, Kim opening ""his heart and mind"" and allowing Rodman to hold his daughter ""for the first time in history"" is something to celebrate. Never mind that the existence of said child has been shrouded in secrecy. North Korea's regime is so restrictive that even state media haven't mentioned the possibility that their leader might have had a daughter. And speaking of children, Rodman shared an interesting detail Monday involving the ""basketball diplomacy"" event he's putting together with Paddy Power, an online betting company. ""The marshall"" -- the term Kim goes by -- ""gave me anything I wanted,"" he said. Kim told him, ""We've got 150,000 kids will do anything for you on the field. We've got 95,000 people will be in the stadium watching this game."" A dictator telling a foreign basketball player he can instruct 150,000 kids, who will comply: In The World According to Dennis Rodman, that's a good thing. Still, reason for hope . Any effort to, as Rodman says, ""bridge a gap"" with North Korea can be construed as a good thing. ""I said to him, 'Your grandfather and your father did some bad things ... but you are trying to change,' "" Rodman said at Monday's news conference. Kim has an ""image"" to keep up, he added. Maybe, one day, Kim Jong Un will knock down the walls behind which his country tries to hide its reality -- including the desperation, pain and horror described by defectors and refugees. Struggling for survival, family tries to feed child mice . But for now, Kim's propaganda machine is ratcheting up, as CNN has reported. Rodman says Kim asked him to do one thing: ""Tell the American people we're very cool."" Mission accomplished, Mr. Rodman.","Dennis Rodman calls North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""a very good guy""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Thirty-two of the world's best football teams are now competing for the iconic golden World Cup trophy -- but the planet's most populous nation is not among them. Team China failed to qualify for the ""beautiful game's"" showpiece event in Brazil. In fact China's World Cup dream turned into a nightmare as early as 2011, when it was eliminated in a regional qualifying round. But for all the interest in football in this country of more than one billion people, it is a huge source of frustration that they can't field a competitive national team. ""China's weakness in football is a pain point and there is certainly an ambition to improve,"" said Scott Kronick, President of Ogilvy Public Relations Asia Pacific. Indeed, a multitude of Chinese -- from the state president, to a Peking University student, to a Beijing taxi driver -- share one Chinese dream: that Team China will one day win in the World Cup finals. Finals flop . China reached the finals only once back in 2002. I remember that heady year. There was a heroes' welcome for the national team, many of whom became icons with fat commercial endorsements. There was deleterious display of national pride accompanied by soaring expectations for Team China. But their debut turned out to be an embarrassing dud: they were knocked out after the group stage without scoring a single goal. Still, these setbacks have not deflated the football fever here. ""There is a huge following for international football in China because local fans celebrate global talent,"" said Kronick, a long-time Beijing resident who plays football in a local amateur league. ""The World Cup is about 'nationalism' at its finest, absent politics, and that's what makes it enjoyable."" Global game . Chinese football fans have been enjoying the action in Brazil despite matches taking place after midnight, Beijing time. By hook or by crook, local fans are finding ways to stay up late for the games. Some took paid leave, others found excuses to stay home, such as getting doctors to sign sick-leave certificates. A man asked to take the day off ostensibly to attend a teacher-parent conference. Some managers say work place productivity has dropped lately. A few companies have simply conceded defeat, agreeing to a staggered work schedule to allow for some employees to stay in late, and come in late. ""The World Cup matches are played in the wee hours,"" said Wang Chen, a venture-capital manager. ""If the staff can't get good sleep, work will be affected, so I pushed back working hours, hoping to arouse their work enthusiasm and efficiency."" ""The World Cup is the biggest sporting event on the planet, so regardless of where you are in the world, you can't escape the excitement and passion surrounding the event, and China is no exception,"" said Misha Sher, director at MediaCom Sport, who manages partnerships for football icon, Pele, on behalf of his own management, Legends10. Sher credits football's popularity here to an increasingly popular Chinese professional league, and to the extensive media exposure of top-level players and games through TV and digital channels like CCTV and Tencent. ""They bring the game into the homes of hundreds of millions of fans, who are now engaged around the World Cup,"" he said. Cash kicks . Enthusiasm for the game brings commercial windfalls. The World Cup advertising revenue for Leshi, one of China's largest video websites is estimated to reach RMB100 million yuan ($16 million), said its top executive Qiang Wei. This summer alone CCTV, the state television network, could rake in as much as RMB1.5 billion yuan ($240 million) in advertising revenue -- 50% more than their earnings from the 2010 World Cup. ""Given the interest generated by the World Cup, many companies are tapping into the passion and emotion created by the competition to connect with consumers,"" said Sher, who recently accompanied Pele to Beijing. Coca Cola has used its sponsorship with a World Cup Trophy Tour, where they took the trophy to over 90 countries and held consumer events. McDonald's ran point of sale promotions, which offered World Cup tickets to winners. Other brands created various content, featuring international and national team players to connect the brand to the event. The competition for advertising and commerce is not limited to sports brands. On the eve of the World Cup, an electric bike manufacturer in southern China brought Pele to Beijing to hitch on the World Cup bandwagon. ""They knew local residents are crazy about football and a legend like Pele endorsing their brand make them more endearing,"" explained Kronick. Since the month-long competition opened in Brazil, legions of Chinese sports fans have been gathering for viewing parties in their living rooms, in factory and school dormitories, and in restaurants and bars, many of which have opened late for the fans to watch matches live on Chinese television. Of course, not all of these sleep-deprived folks are bona fide football fans. A posting on Baidu, China's largest search engine, noted that the Chinese have recently coined the word ""wei qiumi,"" or ""fake soccer fans,"" referring to people who watch the game only once in a while, who care more about the final scores rather than enjoying the actual games, and who think celebrity players play a more important role in matches than the coaches.","China's national team has reached the World Cup finals only once, back in 2002 .

"(CNN) -- As an expression of hard power, they don't come bigger or more fearsome than the USS George Washington. The U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carrier can base as many as 75 warplanes, has a combat load of 97,000 tons and is manned by 6,250 battle-ready crew. But as an expression of soft-power, the Nimitz-class carrier is finding its influence in its Asian theater of operations goes far beyond the range of its fearsome arsenal as it assists the Typhoon Haiyan relief operation -- known as Operation Damayan -- in the Philippines. Equipped with everything from a 51-bed hospital ward and an operating theater to dentists' surgeries, according to Jane's Defense, the USS George Washington is leading a flotilla of U.S. Navy support vessels in support of the effort. The projection of U.S. power on the world stage, especially in the context of a humanitarian disaster such as Haiyan, represents a public relations goldmine for the U.S. military, at a time when the U.S. is perceived as losing influence in the region to China. It may not be the only navy helping in the aftermath of the disaster -- Britain and Australia have both committed vessels to the relief effort -- but considering the Washington's traditional links with the Philippines as a former colony (and for many decades one of its most important strategic bases) the relief effort has a special resonance. ""The U.S. extending its soft power in the region as well as directing the relief operation are not contradictory objectives,"" Philippine political analyst Ramon Casiple told CNN. ""The Philippines and the U.S., of course, have a long history so there is an expectation that they would help because they've helped in previous chapters in our history."" He said even the region that is the focus of the relief effort -- eastern Leyte province -- has special meaning for the U.S.-Philippines relationship. ""This is the area where General MacArthur's forces landed during World War II when he fulfilled the promise of returning to the Philippines after ousting the Japanese. ""But while there's an expectation, there is also a gratefulness for this help."" Criticism has been leveled at China for its ham-fisted handling of its relief contribution, initially pledging $100,000 in humanitarian support. Although it later raised the amount to $1.6 million, analysts have said that it has allowed its spat with the Philippines over the Spratly Islands -- claimed severally by Malaysia, the Philippines, China, Taiwan and Vietnam -- to cloud its judgment. The donation, which does not meet even that of furniture store, Ikea, which has pledged $2.7 million through its charitable foundations, has dented its global image at a time when American influence is seen as declining in the region as China steps into the breach. Analysts say China has missed an opportunity to win hearts and minds though non-traditional forms of diplomacy of which the supply of emergency assistance can form a crucial component. ""One reason China's efforts to develop its soft power have failed is the utilitarian way Beijing approaches the rest of the world. Instead of using culture, adept diplomacy and trashy movies to seduce other countries, China hands out cold, hard cash,"" said analyst William Pesek in a recent Bloomberg View. ""All the investment poured into railways in Indonesia, tunnels in Brazil, power grids in Cambodia, hydroelectric projects in Laos, bridges in Vietnam, roads in Zambia, factories in Malaysia, airports in Myanmar, and mining rigs in Uzbekistan comes with a high cost. In return, China demands complete docility. That's the message being sent to the Philippines now."" Meanwhile, the victims of Haiyan are happy to find help where they can. ""If you are talking of those western allies aligned with the US then you have the same level of commitment to humanitarian aid,"" Casiple said. ""The others, meaning these countries not so aligned to the Philippines or those such as China that have issues with the Philippines, are a bit more reticent. ""But the main thing to remember is that they are giving aid.""","One of U.S. Navy's largest vessels, USS George Washington, is leading typhoon relief effort .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man armed with a rifle, boxes of ammunition and a machete was arrested Friday after allegedly threatening to kill former President George W. Bush, according to a federal court complaint. Benjamin Smith, a resident of upstate New York, threatened to ""kill, kidnap and inflict bodily harm"" on Bush, the complaint said. Smith also professed a love interest in Barbara, one of the former president's twin daughters, according to the complaint filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. ""Bush will get his,"" Smith allegedly screamed as he was being arrested, said the complaint. The U.S. Secret Service was alerted to the threat after Smith's mother found a note in the home they share in which he allegedly wrote that he's ""going to work for George W. Bush and the Pentagon,"" the complaint said. Smith also allegedly wrote: ""I have to slay a dragon and then Barbara Bush is mine... America is finished. Obama, Etc."" Smith's defense lawyer, Peggy Cross-Goldenberg, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. It was not clear whether Smith remained in custody Saturday evening. Smith's mother reported that a rifle was missing from the house and that she did not know where her son was. Using cell phone tracking, the Secret Service located Smith, who they say had driven to Manhattan. On Friday, agents found Smith sitting in his car in Manhattan, with a loaded .38-caliber rifle, two boxes of ammunition, a container of gasoline and a machete, according to authorities. During questioning, Smith told Secret Service agents, ""I'm divorced and not currently seeing anyone, but I am working on a relationship with Barbara Bush,"" the complaint said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans in Washington say they are breathing a sigh of relief now that the Kansas secretary of state has ruled that the Democratic Senate candidate will stay on the ballot in November even though he dropped out. It's a case of political whiplash for national Republicans, who just hours earlier scrambled to send strategists to Kansas when it suddenly became a head-to-head race between incumbent Republican Pat Roberts and an independent candidate with libertarian views, who would likely pull GOP votes from Roberts. The matchup appeared to make it harder for the GOP to seize the Senate majority. Now a GOP strategist tells CNN that Republicans believe keeping Democrat Chad Taylor on the ballot is ""enormous"" because he was only getting 30% of the vote when he was actively campaigning. Republicans predict the Democrat will still get about 10-25% of the vote on Election Day, making it easier for Roberts to beat independent candidate Greg Orman. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to get Republicans elected to the Senate, was already dispatching veteran GOP strategist Chris LaCivita to Kansas, a GOP source tells CNN. The source called it just the first move to try to help bolster Roberts' campaign, which national Republicans worry is lackluster and ill-equipped to run an unexpectedly competitive campaign. Republicans had also enlisted help from former Sen. Bob Dole, the longtime senator from Kansas and a former Senate majority leader, who was already scheduled in the state this week. A source close to Dole tells CNN he is playing the role as ""super consultant"" to Roberts, an old friend. The Senate race in Kansas just got more interesting . 5 Senate races to watch in 2014 . Republicans were moving fast because of the national importance of the race in the GOP quest to regain control of the Senate in November. The GOP has to pick up six seats to take over the Senate. Their advantage has been that they are only playing defense in two states: Kentucky and Georgia. Adding Kansas to the list has many implications, most immediately with money. After 30 years in Senate, McConnell tries to run as 'candidate of change' Republican resources are already spread thin because there are so many neck-and-neck races where they are spending campaign cash -- mostly where they are playing offense trying to pick up Democratic seats everywhere from Louisiana to Alaska to North Carolina and New Hampshire and beyond. When Roberts narrowly won a GOP primary race earlier this year, Republicans thought he would have relatively smooth sailing towards re-election. Kansas is so conservative, it has only been represented by Republican senators for three quarters of a century. U.S. Chamber ramps up efforts in key N.C. Senate race . But then Orman began to climb in the polls. The three-way race was already making things tougher for Roberts, but on Wednesday night, Taylor abruptly withdrew, paving the way for a head to head matchup between Roberts and Orman, an independent running on a libertarian platform. Republican strategists tell CNN they had to drag Roberts over the finish line for his GOP primary race, and they hope he understands that he has to work harder than before to win re-election.","Kansas secretary of state rules Democrat must stay on ballot even though he dropped out .

"(CNN) -- The wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas said Tuesday that she reached out to Anita Hill, whose accusations of sexual harassment almost derailed Thomas' high court nomination 19 years ago. In a statement to CNN, Virginia ""Ginni"" Thomas said: ""I did place a call to Ms. Hill at her office extending an olive branch to her after all these years, in hopes that we could ultimately get past what happened so long ago. That offer still stands, I would be very happy to meet and talk with her if she would be willing to do the same. Certainly no offense was ever intended."" Hill, a law professor at Brandeis University, turned the message over to campus security, a university spokesman said. According to a source at Brandeis who spoke on condition of not being identified, the message left over the weekend said: . ""Good morning, Anita Hill, it's Ginni Thomas. I just wanted to reach across the airwaves and the years and ask you to consider something. I would love you to consider an apology some time and some full explanation of why you did what you did with my husband. So give it some thought and certainly pray about this and come to understand why you did what you did. OK, have a good day."" Hill, who formerly worked for Clarence Thomas, testified at his 1991 Senate confirmation hearing that he used inappropriate sexual language around her. The testimony dominated the hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which deadlocked on the nomination to send it to the full Senate without a recommendation. The Senate approved Thomas' nomination on a 52-48 vote. Charles Radin, the Brandeis director of news and communications, said Hill received the voicemail message and turned it over to the campus Department of Public Safety, which then turned it over to the FBI.

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Opposition leader Chokri Belaid routinely received death threats for his outspoken criticism of Tunisia's Islamist-led government. He talked about the bullying on his frequent television appearances but said he didn't fear for his life. But on Wednesday morning, a gunman shot and killed Belaid in front of his home as he was leaving for work, according to an eyewitness. Belaid's political allies and even his Islamist opponents are decrying the murder as an assassination, sparking new protests in the cradle of the ""Arab Spring."" Tunisia's president: 'The extremists are a minority of a minority' The killing of Belaid, 48, has shocked the nation. Police had fired on protesters, killing some of them, during the December 2010-January 2011 revolt that drove the country's longtime strongman into exile. But the targeted slaying of a politician crossed a new line. Video showed outraged protesters filling the Avenue Habib Bourguiba in Tunis and pouring into the streets of other Tunisian cities. Some of them revived the iconic slogan of their revolution, crying: ""The people want to topple the regime."" Read more: Who will win battle for the new Tunisia? Angry clashes broke out in front of Tunisia's Interior Ministry, where police used tear gas to disperse the protesters. Sympathizers not interested in politics also turned out to mourn the popular public figure and express their shock about the violence that has marred the country's heated -- but otherwise previously peaceful -- public debate. Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, himself an Islamist and head of the moderate religious party Ennahda, quickly condemned the bloodletting on state television. By Wednesday night, Jebali had sacked his Cabinet and called for new elections, leaving himself at the head of a caretaker government. ""Belaid was killed, but the real target behind the assassination is the Tunisian revolution as a whole,""Jebali said of his political adversary. ""He represented the true values of dialogue, respecting and embracing others in rejecting violence. This is a political assassination."" Inside a dictator's palace: Fake diplomas, sports cars, stuffed leopard . But his expression of indignation did not stop angry protesters from storming Ennhada offices. Belaid's brother, Abdelmajid Belaid, blamed Jebali's Ennhada party for the killing. Belaid's death was ""a clear message to Tunisians ... shut up, or we kill you,"" Abdelmajid Belaid said. He said his brother ""has been been receiving threats of murder for a long time,"" including a text message Tuesday. And Chokri's widow, Basma, told Tunisian state TV: ""We are damned. The political struggle is damned in Tunisia. Chokri Belaid sacrificed his soul."" Belaid's support went beyond his own party, the secular-leftist Democratic Patriots. He was the voice of a large coalition of secular opposition parties known as the Popular Front and had a reputation for decrying violence. Interior Minister Ali al-Areed vowed to track down the killers and joined the chorus of moral indignation, calling Belaid's killing ""an attack on all Tunisians."" At the same time, he asked that protests remain peaceful: ""We do not want the country to fall into chaos,"" he said on Tunisian state TV. Read more: How a fruit seller caused revolution in Tunisia . French President Francois Hollande also condemned the assassination, saying Belaid's murder deprived Tunisia ""of one of its most courageous and free voices."" Belaid had fought throughout his public life for liberty, tolerance and respect for human rights, Hollande said, with the deeply held conviction that dialogue and democracy must be at the heart of the new Tunisia. Hollande said France, Tunisia's onetime colonial ruler, is concerned about the increase in political violence. He urged respect for the ideals that drove the country's revolution. And in Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland called for Tunisia's government ""to conduct a fair, transparent and professional investigation"" of Belaid's killing. ""It's also important to note that a broad base of Tunisian political parties and actors have also condemned this violent act,"" Nuland said. ""There is no justification for an outrageous and cowardly act of violence such as this. There is no place in the new Tunisia for violence."" One of Belaid's neighbors heard the first shot discharge in the quiet Tunis suburb of Menzah 6. He looked out of his apartment to see a gunman fire two more shots at close range. At least one bullet hit Belaid squarely in the chest, said Dr. Hedi Tebourbi. The physician felt certain he must have died right away. A man waited close by on a motorbike for the gunman to hop on, Tebourbi said. They sped away from the scene. An ambulance took Belaid to a nearby hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead. Journalist Houda Zaghdoudi reported from Tunis. CNN's Saad Abedine and Ben Brumfield reported from Atlanta, and Laura Smith-Spark from London.","NEW: Tunisia's prime minister sacks Cabinet, calls new elections .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Jason Diamond knows what it's like to be sought after. The Beverly Hills plastic surgeon -- first made famous by reality show ""Dr. 90210"" -- has operated on a range of A-list celebrities (though he declines to name them). Yet even he was unprepared for the clamor that met him when he first visited Dubai in what was meant to be a one-time gig as a guest surgeon. ""For that week, I literally had people waiting until 2am for a consultation. The waiting room was filled 20 people-deep all day long,"" he recalls. That was in 2009. Since, Diamond has returned to the city every two to three months as part of a partnership with the American British Surgical and Medical Centre. Over the years, he has enlisted the Who's Who of Beverly Hills surgeons to join him at the practice. ""Every time I go, I don't even sit down. I'm running around from 7am until midnight. The demand is literally out the door,"" he says. In the last couple of years, Dubai has become a nip-and-tuck hub. Where once residents from throughout the GCC would venture to Beverly Hills, Brazil or Beirut for treatments, these days, they're staying closer to home to have work done. ""In Lebanon, I'd say it's been about a 30-40% drop [in business],"" says Dr. Sami Saad, the national secretary for the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) in Lebanon. ""A lot of surgeons are leaving. They're moving to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Kuwait. These countries are safer and more attractive for plastic surgeons,"" he says. The Botox Brigade . Diamond notes that these days, ""there is no paucity of plastic surgeons"" in Dubai. According to the Emirates Plastic Surgery Society, their membership has jumped from 60 in 2006 to 150 this year. In fact, there are more cosmetic surgeons per citizen in the UAE than in either Brazil or the United States -- two nations lauded for their love of the scalpel. ""The market is very saturated,"" notes Dr. Luiz Toledo, a plastic surgeon who moved his practice to Dubai from Brazil in 2005 who is also on the scientific committee of the Emirates Plastic Surgery Society. ""Every day I get emails [from surgeons] saying, 'I heard Dubai is good for business. I want to come and visit, do some work, then come back home.' Everybody thinks Dubai is this mecca full of rich people. They think they'll come over and find gold on the streets. It's not like that; it's hard work,"" he says. Despite the influx, experts say demand for plastic surgery is on the rise. According to the Dubai Health Authority (DHA), in 2012, medical tourists made up 8.7% of total health sector revenue, with many seeking cosmetic procedures. ""The industry is growing very fast,"" notes Vasilica Baltateanu, founder of Dubai plastic surgery consultancy Vasilica Aesthetics. She says the city's healthcare market is expected to grow 11.4% over the next two years. A beauty smorgasbord . As Dubai is one of the most multicultural cities in the world (200 different nationalities call the emirate home), it's no surprise that surgeons are noticing a broad demographic willing to go under the knife. ""Last year, I saw patients from 73 nationalities, which is a record,"" says Toledo. Though patients come from as far afield as Africa and Eastern Europe, the majority, he says, come from the GCC, with many making the trip from Saudi Arabia. Diamond also reports having operated on many Saudi woman, who traditionally wear a veil in their day-to-day lives. ""In America, you're not exposed to too many people who cover their face, and you assume those who do don't care about their appearance because they never show it off. But once you get to know the culture, you realize they're not that different from us. Middle Eastern women love looking good just as much as American women do,"" he says. And it's not just women investing in their looks. Surgeons in the area have reported seeing a growing number of men in their clinics, as well as teenagers (Baltateanu estimates that 15% of plastic surgery patients in the UAE are under 23). She adds that in her experience, Arab patients are often more gung-ho than their Western counterparts. ""In Europe, America and Australia, people will try to adopt their lifestyle first. Liposuction, for instance, would be a last resort after you've tried everything else. Here, it's more, 'I've gained some weight, I'll get some lipo,' and they'll get the treatment four or five times, which is when it becomes dangerous,"" she warns. Part of her job, she says, is discouraging patients from over-indulging in treatments.","Dubai has dethroned Lebanon as plastic surgery capital of Middle East .
There are nearly 3 times as many plastic surgeons in Dubai as there were in 2006 .

"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers didn't consider herself to be one of the boys. And for that, we can be grateful. Over the course of her nearly 50-year career, Rivers rummaged through, flipped over and laughed at all the facets of being a woman -- from the '60s-era pressure to marry to the reality of aging in a youth-obsessed business -- without ever succumbing to the expectations of what a woman stand-up comedian was ""supposed"" to sound like. ""Every woman in comedy is indebted to her,"" Amy Poehler, ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran, said upon Rivers' death Thursday at the age of 81. ""She was there at the beginning and funny to the end."" Joan Rivers dies at 81 . The path Rivers helped carve leads us straight to female stand-up powerhouses such as Kathy Griffin, Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer, all of whom are as fearless in their humor, and whom they direct it toward, as Rivers was. But when Rivers began her stand-up career in the late '50s, that brazenness was unheard of -- for women, at least. ""I was talking about having an affair with a married professor and that wasn't a thing a nice Jewish girl talked about,"" Rivers told author Yael Kohen in Kohen's book, ""We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy."" ""I was talking about my mother, desperate to get my sister and me married. I was talking about my gay friend Mr. Phyllis, and you just didn't talk about that. It sounds so tame and silly now, but my act spoke to women who weren't able to talk about things."" Initially, Rivers wanted to be an actress, and took up temp work while she pursued her goal. But when a fellow secretary pointed out that she could get paid for all the jokes she was landing around the office, Rivers tried her hand at comedy. ""I had no idea what I was doing. The white men were doing 'mother-in-law' and 'my wife's so fat ...' jokes,"" Rivers recalled in a 2012 Hollywood Reporter essay. ""When I went onstage, that just didn't feel right. So I just said, 'Let me talk about my life.'"" Rivers: A pointed, pioneering comedian . She wasn't alone: George Carlin, Woody Allen and Bill Cosby -- classic comedians who were then on the rise -- all mined their personal lives for laughs. But although they were ""coming up at the same time"" as she was, and had similar instincts about humor, Rivers still didn't quite fit in. ""I never was one of the guys,"" Rivers wrote in THR. ""I was never asked to go hang out; I never thought about it until later. They would all go to the Stage Delicatessen afterward and talk. I never got to go uptown and have a sandwich with them. So, even though I was with them, I wasn't with them."" And maybe all the better for it. Once she got her big break in 1965 on Johnny Carson's ""The Tonight Show,"" Rivers made a name for herself as a woman who would talk frankly and freely about what that meant. The female body, her sex life, the politics of dating and relationships -- everything was fair game, and she saw no need in putting anything delicately. A 1967 appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" might seem dated with its references to the single life, but Rivers' indignation at the disparity between men and women is righteously honest (and, honestly, not that out of place with today). ""The girl has to be the one that's bright, and pretty, and intelligent, a good sport -- 'Howard Johnson's again, hooray, hooray!'"" Rivers sarcastically pantomimed to the audience's delight. ""It just kills me! A girl, you're 30 years old, you're not married, you're an old maid. A man, he's 90 years old, he's not married, he's a catch. It's a whole different thing, isn't that so?"" she asked, as the audience applauded. Joan Rivers: Hollywood mourns a friend . That chatty style made Rivers an obvious pick for her own talk show, and she proved it as Carson's guest host and frequent stand-in on ""Tonight."" It was there, as one People magazine critic proclaimed, that she could be ""the bitchy queen of late night whose humorous bark left bite marks."" After shifting perceptions through Carson's show, Rivers stepped out on her own in 1986 with ""The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers."" The program only lasted for eight months, but it nonetheless broke the rules; Rivers was the first woman to command her own late night talk show, and is still to this day one of the few women who've broken into late night TV's notorious boys club. ""You have to be extraordinarily strong without them seeing you be that,"" Rivers told CNN of her experience in late night in 2013. ""You're a lion tamer. You have to be in total command, but you still have to be feminine, and you still have to be funny, and you still have to be inquisitive -- it's a very tough thing, and it's tough for women because you don't expect a woman to take control. Still."" But they are. From Chelsea Handler, who's ending a top run on E! to build something new at Netflix; to Schumer, who just earned her first Emmy nod for her Comedy Central show; to media titans like Ellen DeGeneres and Whoopi Goldberg -- the women who followed Rivers haven't all been as controversial, but they have all shown traits of her dogged persistence. Opinion: Joan Rivers gave misfit girls a permission to dream . Kathy Griffin is perhaps one of the most shining examples. Like Rivers, Griffin has a talent for nailing celebrities to the wall with a smile, while simultaneously flaying herself. Nowhere was that more evident than her Emmy-winning reality show, ""Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List,"" a self-deprecating examination of how Griffin was trying and failing to climb the Hollywood ladder. It's not hard to imagine that if Rivers had been born a few decades later, she would've made a similar show. (After all, Rivers kept working hard right up until her passing, starring in reality shows with her daughter, Melissa, and gleefully torturing celebrities on E!'s ""Fashion Police."") Reflecting on Rivers in the comedian's 2010 documentary, ""A Piece of Work,"" Griffin summed up the late legend's impact thusly: ""Much in the way that Phyllis Diller paved the way for her,"" she said, ""I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for Joan.""","Joan Rivers helped break the mold for women in comedy .
She got her start speaking ""to women who weren't able to talk about things""
During her stand-up, she spoke frankly about being a woman .
The following generations of women comedians have thanked her for opening doors ."
"(CNN) -- Ewwwww. That about sums up how people are describing conditions aboard the Carnival Triumph on Tuesday as tugboats slowly drag the stricken cruise ship toward Alabama -- and freedom for its 3,143 passengers. Some on the ship reported sewage sloshing around in hallways, flooded rooms and trouble getting enough to eat after a fire in the ship's engine room Sunday left it drifting in the Gulf of Mexico. Passengers dragged their mattresses onto the ship's open deck to stay cool and get away from the nasty smells inside. ""The odor is so bad, people are getting sick and they're throwing up everywhere,"" said Brent Nutt, whose wife is aboard the ship. But not all passengers share the same dire view of the situation. A poster on the cruising forum cruisecritic.com said her sister reported passengers have enough food and are ""enjoying the extended vacation."" The fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late January, when it had an issue with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted to Carnival senior cruise director John Heald's website. The company also recently repaired one of Triumph's alternators, the company said Tuesday. However, there's no evidence the alternator problem and the fire are linked, cruise line spokesman Vance Gulliksen said. Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill told reporters on Tuesday evening that the cruise line is using its full resources to assist passengers and family members in a ""very challenging"" situation. ""No one here at Carnival is happy about conditions on board the ship,"" Cahill said. ""We are very sorry about what is taking place."" Carnival expects the ship to arrive in Mobile on Thursday afternoon. Sunday's fire came as the Triumph steamed about 150 miles off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on the way back to Galveston, Texas. The ship was on the third day of a four-day cruise. ""We all woke up and panicked,"" passenger Donna Gutzman told CNN Houston affiliate KPRC. ""A couple other alarms went off and we started seeing smoke."" Read related: Cruise safety drill results in 5 deaths . Triumph's automatic fire extinguishing system kicked in and soon contained the flames, and no injuries were reported, Carnival said. But the fire knocked out the ship's propulsion system and left the vessel slowly drifting in the Gulf until a second tugboat arrived Tuesday, joining one that had come earlier. The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Vigorous is also sailing nearby to provide assistance if necessary. The tugboats are towing the Triumph toward Mobile at a rate of 5 mph to 8 mph, Vigorous Cmdr. Greg Magee told CNN Tuesday. The cruise line said the ship was listing at 2 degrees, an improvement from a previous 4.5-degrees reading. Winds are causing the list, it said. Technicians aboard the ship were trying to restore power and provide more onboard facilities, Gulliksen said. Passenger Ann Barlow said the staff on the Triumph was doing a good job, but flooded rooms, hot, humid conditions, long lines for food and overwhelming odors were making things tough for passengers. ""It's disgusting. It's the worst thing ever,"" she told CNN Monday. Barlow's husband, Toby, said she told him there was ""sewage running down the walls and floors"" with passengers being asked to defecate in bags and urinate in showers due to the lack of functioning toilets. The air conditioning is also out. But things were getting better, according to Nutt and Gulliksen. Read related: What caused the Costa Cruises ship disaster? Gulliksen said Tuesday that there is running water -- cold only -- in some cabins. Most of the 23 public restrooms are working, said Cahill, along with some toilets in forward and midship cabins. The ship's poolside restaurant was open until 10 p.m. Monday night and reopened again at 7 a.m. Tuesday. And, Gulliksen said, ""Carnival Triumph's entertainment staff has planned various activities to keep guests entertained."" There are 1,086 crew members on the ship. Carnival also brought meals aboard from two other cruise ships, the cruise line said Monday. Earlier, Carnival said in a statement that hot coffee was available, among other options. Carnival initially planned to tow the ship to Progreso, Mexico, but strong currents that had pushed it 90 miles north by Monday night prompted the decision to move the ship to Mobile instead. The change also made it easier on the 900 passengers who don't have passports, the cruise line said. Passengers will get a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and most expenses aboard, and a credit for another cruise, Carnival said. Carnival said it will provide 20 charter flights Friday to get disembarked passengers to Houston so they can take other flights home. About 1,500 hotel rooms have been reserved in Mobile and New Orleans. Sheila Gurganus, general manager of the Mobile cruise terminal, said medical personnel will be on hand to help anyone in need. There were no requests for such aid Tuesday afternoon, she said. Other agencies will help expedite the passengers' return home. The incident has forced Carnival to cancel the ship's next two departures, refund bookings for those trips and offer those passengers discounts on future cruises. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency. In 2010, the Carnival's cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The USS Ronald Reagan ferried 60,000 pounds of supplies for the ship's passengers and crew as the ship was towed to San Diego. Cahill told reporters the Splendor and Triumph incidents are very different. The Splendor had an explosion in a diesel generator. Richard Burke, chairman of the engineering department at the State University of New York's Maritime College, told CNN he had ""no reason to believe that Carnival in any way is not a first-class operator. Nor do I believe that their ships are not good ships. I think they are just being unlucky right now."" Read also: Eight icy getaways .

"(CNN) -- Almost 70 years after the U.S. military dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, effectively ending World War II, the site of the devastation remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. And it appears to be getting more popular. According to a recent report in The Japan Times, visits to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum by foreign tourists hit a record high of 200,086 in 2013. Local officials confirm that the memorial site is attracting an increasing number of tourists to study the burnt wreckage, painful witness testimonies and human shadows left permanently visible after the atomic bomb explosion's incandescent destruction. A number of factors lay behind the site's continuing hold on travelers. Some people describe Hiroshima as a gripping, educational and emotional example of ""dark tourism,"" ""grief tourism"" or ""battlefield tourism,"" which includes Nazi concentration camps in Europe, Cambodia's torture prison and killing fields, West African slave ports and Manhattan's 9/11 crater. Most tourists gaze in mute awe at Hiroshima's Atomic Bomb Genbaku Dome, which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The now-iconic structure, designed in 1915 by a Czech architect, was the city's Industrial Promotion Hall. When the United States dropped the bomb on August 6, 1945, it exploded just above the building, but didn't totally destroy it because the immediate blast and heat buffered the air at ground zero. TripAdvisor calls Peace Memorial a top Japan attraction . About 363,000 tourists visited Hiroshima City during 2012, according the most recent statistics. Americans comprise the largest number, followed by Australians and Chinese, according to statistics for the city and surrounding prefecture. Countless Japanese also visit. ""The name 'Hiroshima' has been well-known among foreign countries from its history, and recently word-of-mouth effect from visitors adds more reality to it,"" Hiroshima Convention and Visitors Bureau representative Taeko Abe told CNN in an e-mail. ""In recent years, word-of-mouth information from Internet and so on also has a strong influence. ""For example, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum ranked number one ... for the ranking of 'the most popular tourist spots in Japan for foreign tourists' at the travel website TripAdvisor two years in a row."" The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and A-Bomb Dome appeared at the top of a 2012 TripAdvisor list of Top 20 Travel Destinations for Foreign Visitors in Japan. The Peace Memorial Museum ranks number-two (behind the ""shrine island"" of Miyajima, also in Hiroshima Prefecture) on the site's current list of Top 20 Must-see Attractions in Japan Awarded by Inbound Travelers. Nightmarish displays . The atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima from an American B-29 bomber. The explosion obliterated nearly everything within 10-square kilometers (six square miles) in the downtown area, killing 60,000 to 80,000 people. Radiation poisoning eventually sickened others, resulting in an estimated final total death toll of 135,000 people. Across the Motoyasu River, which flows in front of the A-Bomb Dome, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum displays evocative exhibits, including a blistered and fused tricycle that a four-year-old boy was riding during the blast that burned him to death. Photos and documentary films, nightmarish drawings by survivors, scientific explanations of the explosion, plus other artifacts including melted glass and charred clothing, hint at the unimaginable. ""This museum was established by the city of Hiroshima to convey the reality of the atomic bombing to the world, and contribute to the total abolition of nuclear weapons, and realization of lasting world peace,"" Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum director Kenji Shiga told CNN in an e-mail. The museum's growing popularity among tourists is due in part to ""the weaker yen and various tourism-promoting activities conducted by the national and local government,"" Shiga said. ""We also consider the high reputation of TripAdvisor, which attracts a lot of foreign visitors, as one of the biggest reasons"" that more travelers arrive each year, he said. From devastation to hope . The concept of ""peace"" is one of Hiroshima's biggest attractions. ""Hiroshima City has achieved a remarkable recovery from that devastation, although the first atomic bomb in history was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and has pursued everlasting world peace for mankind,"" said Abe of the Hiroshima Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""Visitors say they feel its most powerful message, that of hope, and appreciate anew the importance of peace,"" he said. ""The impression of Hiroshima that visitors take away seems to be affected by whether they have had the opportunity to meet and communicate with local people,"" Abe said. Bruce Bottomley, 45, an English instructor from Canada, has visited the Memorial Museum, A-Bomb Dome and related sites during repeat trips to Hiroshima. ""My strongest memory is of the watches that stopped at the moment the bomb detonated,"" he said. ""The burnt metal lunch boxes of the young students with the petrified rice still inside is a quiet, jaw-dropping sight. ""I don't know what it is, but I can feel and sense it when I am there. The tales of survivors with photographs are striking and even shocking to a degree. ""I couldn't help think of my grandfather and what he would have been doing in Canada at the same time there was such tragic destruction,"" said Bottomley, who has also visited the second atomic bomb blast memorial in Nagasaki. Making the bombing 'real' for new generations . ""I visited Hiroshima in July 1998, during my first visit to Japan,"" said Evan Hayden, 34, an American graphic designer who teaches English in Nagasaki. ""My student group went to the Memorial Museum, the Peace Memorial and the Peace Memorial Park. We saw the [origami] paper cranes while there. ""It made the bombing more of a reality for me and my fellow high school students. Only reading about it in textbooks, and seeing footage on TV, made the event seem abstract and remote. ""It was profound to see artifacts such as a mangled, charred tricycle, as well as people's shadows burned into concrete from the blast,"" Hayden said. Difficult history . Debate about whether or not the United States should have dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki continues to swirl. ""I'm against the fact that Japan was bombed, of course, but at the same time, the war kept going in a nasty direction and neither Japan nor the U.S.A. was backing down,"" said Hayden. ""A tragic story."" Hiroshima's memorial is ""not a fun thing to do on one's vacation, obviously, but it is an important experience that people can learn a lot from,"" he added. Some remain reluctant to visit the site. ""If I do have the chance, I don't know if I will make a visit or not,"" said Maki Hakui, 43, a Tokyo-based Japanese publisher and translator. ""I should go as a Japanese citizen, taking my daughter with me. Honestly speaking, I feel very reluctant to go, as I know that it will be a tough experience for me,"" she said. Today, Japan's National Tourism Organization describes Hiroshima's atomic bomb site simply as, ""Negative cultural heritage that tells of the mistakes humanity has made.""

"(CNN) -- Seth Casteel never expected his photos of dogs to make a big splash, but then again, he never expected one of his canine clients to jump into a pool during a shoot. Casteel, 31, is the photographer behind a quirky collection of images of dogs caught in the act of diving, swimming, splashing and generally goofing off in the water. What makes the photos different from anything you've seen before is Casteel's perspective: below the surface, with the dogs lunging toward the camera in pursuit of a toy. Dogs are an interesting subject, he says. ""They enjoy the benefits of 21st century living, staying in a warm house, sleeping in the bed with you,"" he says, ""but getting in the water brings out the wildness in them."" Casteel's soggy dogs shot to stardom on February 9, when someone posted a few of his pictures on the social sharing site Reddit and they became an overnight viral hit, spreading to Facebook, Google+ and Twitter and in short order reaching 150 million views. His website (www.littlefriendsphoto.com) crashed under the weight of a huge increase in traffic. ""By the morning of February 10 the pictures were everywhere,"" he said. ""It just went nuts. It literally happened in the blink of an eye."" Suddenly he was receiving requests and offers from all over the world. One of those offers was a book deal from Little, Brown and Company, which on October 23 published ""Underwater Dogs,"" a 132-page coffee-table book ($19.99) dripping with drenched dogs. A 2013 wall calendar also is on sale. ""I would have never known something like this could happen,"" Casteel said. ""I went from not having enough work to having too much work."" Casteel said he wants to show the unique personality of each dog he photographs and tell its story. ""I'm interested in how emotional they are and how similar to humans they are,"" he said. Before the shooting starts, Casteel spends time getting to know the dog and earning its trust. ""I show up, we start playing fetch, we become pals and we just move it to the water,"" he said. Casteel wears a wet suit and snorkel mask, and sometimes uses diving weights to keep himself from floating. Then he tosses a toy and starts shooting. Cooling off in the dog days of summer . He never knows what he's going to get. Sometimes it takes two hours in the water to get a good shot, as it did with a pug named Duncan. On the other hand, Duchess, the wide-eyed black Labrador on the cover of the book, gave him that stellar image within three minutes, he said. ""I could have a great shot immediately -- or not,"" Casteel said. ""But that's what I love about it."" Some of the photos are downright frightening or otherworldly as the rambunctious animals bare their teeth and flail their paws in pursuit of an elusive tennis ball or other toy. ""You might get something silly or you might get something terrifying,"" the photographer said. ""Some kids think those really kind of primal, edgy shots are funny."" The way Casteel got into dog photography is a story in itself. ""For me, it's been like destiny if you believe in that sort of thing,"" he said. While working in advertising at Sony Pictures, he started volunteering at a Los Angeles-area animal shelter. Casteel shot flattering portraits of animals awaiting adoption, a departure from the usual shelter photos of terrified animals in small, dark cages. Nicer pictures, ones that brought out the animals' personalities, resulted in more adoptions, he said. ""We've gotten fantastic results from showing positive photographs,"" he said. Soon after, he and a stranger cooperated to corral a stray Weimaraner that was running around on a busy road. After the dog was safely out of traffic, the men chatted, Casteel mentioned his shelter photos and the stranger hired Casteel to take pictures of his dog. Referrals led to similar gigs. It was at one of those private shoots that a dog first jumped into a pool, and a new career was born. (The New York Times recently hired Casteel to go to Alaska to shoot the sockeye salmon migration. A major difference between photographing dogs and photographing fish, he joked, is that ""the salmon certainly aren't interested in a tennis ball."") His work at the shelter also led Casteel to create a nonprofit organization called Second Chance Photos, through which he trains shelters in the art of pet photography. That work has taken him all over the United States as well as to Australia and Great Britain, he said. ""I really enjoy it because it gives me freedom to explore what I'm passionate about."" ""I don't even call it a job. It's my life,"" he added. ""It's kind of a dream-come-true thing for me."" How do you think your pooch would fare in an underwater shoot?

"(CNN) -- Ernie Bender was lean and athletic; he skied and walked a lot, and would go snowshoeing every Wednesday with his friends. A golf course superintendent, he lived in Vail, Colorado, with his wife and three sons. One evening in 2000, he and his buddies decided to snowshoe up Vail Mountain and ride the gondola down. Bender complained of indigestion on the way up, which was odd because his last meal had been lunch. He told his friends he needed to sit down before getting on the gondola. After the group got in the cable car, he lost consciousness. Bender was not a smoker and only drank a glass of wine every now and then. His blood pressure was always fine. His physician had told him that his cholesterol was fine, too, but that he might need to watch it, his wife, Kim Tofferi, remembers. But despite appearing healthy, Bender died of a heart attack at age 47. ""We did not see that coming at all,"" Tofferi said. ""That was a tough one -- just when Dad was starting to become a good male role model for (their sons)."" Heart attacks may seem like a senior citizen phenomenon, considering that about 82% of people who die of coronary heart disease are at least 65, according to the American Heart Association. But sudden heart problems can occur much earlier in life, too. ""The Sopranos"" actor James Gandolfini, 51, died in Rome Wednesday of an apparent heart attack. Actor Michael Clarke Duncan died in September at age 54, having never recovered from the heart attack he suffered on July 13. Sage Stallone, son of actor Sylvester Stallone, died of atherosclerosis, a condition that brought on a heart attack, according to the Los Angeles County coroner. He was 36. Heart attack risk goes up in men older than 45 and women older than 55, but it can happen even earlier. While lifestyle modifications help reduce risk -- eating a healthy diet, maintaining good blood pressure and normal weight, not smoking -- sometimes it's not enough. Family history is a big risk factor that can't be changed. Bender's father had a triple bypass surgery more than a year before Bender's death, Tofferi said. And men are more likely to have heart attacks than women. What causes a heart attack? A heart attack happens when the blood that flows to a section of heart muscle gets blocked. That section of heart muscle begins to die without a quick restoration of blood flow, according to the National Institutes of Health. Heart attacks are often the result of coronary artery disease, which occurs when a waxy substance called plaque builds up in the coronary artery. An autopsy revealed that Bender had severe blockage, Tofferi said. The location in the artery involved plays a role, said Alan Ackermann, a cardiologist in Miami. If there's a huge clot producing such extensive damage that the heart stops beating, it could only take a matter of minutes to be fatal. Heart attacks in the United States are uncommon among people younger than 55, but the numbers could rise because obesity is a growing problem, said Dr. Lee Goldman, Hatch Professor and dean of the faculties of health sciences and medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Being overweight leads to Type II diabetes and increases in blood pressure and bad cholesterol. Heavy smoking is also a strong risk factor for heart attacks. Refraining from smoking and not becoming obese are key for avoiding heart attacks, he said. If you are obese, make sure your cholesterol and blood pressure are under control. ""There's no better prevention than addressing the reversible risk factors,"" Goldman said. When a person who's especially young dies of heart problems, such as in their thirties or younger, something other than blockage to the heart may be at work, Ackermann said. The heart could be enlarged or thickened, or there may be a congenital abnormality that would predispose the person to die suddenly. Because younger people don't believe they're at risk of heart attacks, they might not get themselves to a hospital right away when experiencing warning signs. Who will get a heart attack is still somewhat mysterious . There's still a long way to go in terms of determining who is most at risk of a heart attack, he said. ""More often than not, the first symptom of heart disease could be heart attack,"" Ackermann said. ""That is a huge gap in the profession that we're still dealing with."" Red wine, minus the alcohol, may lower blood pressure . A recent study showed that a test called a coronary calcium scan can be effective in predicting cardiovascular risk. This scan identifies specks of calcium in the arterial walls, which are an early sign of plaque buildup. It's relatively cheap -- about $200 -- but does involve some radiation exposure. Ackermann recommends it for women as young as 50, and for men 45 and older. But if you have a strong family history of premature heart disease, it may be best to start even earlier in the forties. One of Ackermann's patients, Osvaldo Gomez, had his first heart attack at age 43. He drove himself to the hospital in 2008 when he started having pain in his chest, back, arm and jaw. He didn't know he had heart problems, but his grandparents and two uncles on his mother's side had cardiovascular disease. The event was scary, but Gomez didn't follow his doctor's recommendations. His second heart attack was a month later. ""The second time, he was noncompliant with diet and his regimen of smoking,"" Ackermann said. ""I wasn't surprised. When he was very compliant, he does great."" In the past four years, Gomez has had three stents and four balloon angioplasties. Stents can improve blood flow and treat narrow or weak arteries. A balloon angioplasty is a ballooning of the vessel to open it. ""I've seen the results of me not taking care of myself,"" Gomez said. A more heart-healthy lifestyle . These days, Gomez is on a low-cholesterol, low-fat diet. He exercises six times a week, with at least 40 minutes of cardio and 20 to 30 minutes of weight lifting. He has quit smoking. Practicing these behaviors ""keeps you out of the hospital and keeps you out of trouble,"" he said. Tofferi, whose husband died after snowshoeing in 2008, watches out for trans fats and has warned her three sons about heart risks. They are in good shape, she said, and none of them smoke. ""They know, with Dad having a heart event that early,"" she said. ""I hope I've impressed them -- or just general health knowledge has impressed them -- with the importance of taking care of yourself.""","Heart attack risk goes up in men over 45 and women over 55 .
It can happen even earlier: Sage Stallone died at age 36 .

"(CNN) -- ""Who did that to you?"" a bicyclist in Waukesha, Wisconsin, asked the 12-year-old girl he found bloodied and lying near a wooded area. His words were captured on a recording of the 911 call he made, which has now been released. The cyclist explained to the 911 operator that the girl told him she'd been stabbed multiple times. ""Is she awake?"" the operator asked, ""Is she breathing?"" ""Yes, she's breathing,"" the cyclist said. ""She says she can take shallow breaths. She's alert."" Was there anyone around, a possible assailant? the operator asked. ""I don't see anybody,"" the cyclist answered. Police say they have the suspects who attacked the girl, stabbing her 19 times. They were her friends, authorities say, two other 12-year-olds: Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier. Geyser and Weier had concocted a plan to kill their friend so that they could impress a ghoulish character called Slenderman, according to authorities. Weier explained to police that Slenderman was the leader of a web site called creepypasta and in order to please him, a follower had to kill a person, according to a criminal complaint in the case. In reality, Slenderman is a fictional character and Internet meme that appears in horror stories, videos and images. ""Both suspects had a fascination with a fictitious character that often posted"" to websites dealing with stories about death and horror, Waukesha's police chief Russell Jack has said. Geyser and Weier were arrested hours after the victim was discovered, according to the complaint. They have been charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, according to court documents filed Monday. The two are being charged as adults and appeared in court Monday where bail was set at $500,000 for each, Waukesha County District Attorney Brad Schimel said. Waukesha police Capt. Ron Oremus told CNN Wednesday that investigators are searching through digital evidence including iPads and cell phones. Anthony Cotton, Geyser's attorney, told CNN Tuesday that he's spoken briefly with his client. She is housed at a juvenile facility for females, he said. Her family is in ""shock,"" the lawyer said, adding that he expected Geyser to undergo a mental evaluation. Attempts to contact an attorney for Weier have not been successful. The condition of the victim has been updated to fair at Waukesha Memorial Hospital, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Wednesday. Brother says sister loved Slenderman . Weier's older brother, William, told the Daily Mail Wednesday that he knew about his sister's interest in the character Slenderman. She liked to watch online videos about the spooky character with long tentacle-like arms and a blank face, said William Weier, a makeup artist who works for a local variety show. ""If you looked at my younger sister you'd see a normal, happy 12-year-old,"" he told the Mail. ""She's just got a couple of weird interests. Personally, I think she found Slenderman on YouTube, took an interest and then read up on it."" Anissa Weier also liked the web site creepypasta.com, her brother explained to the Mail. Creepypasta is a play on the term ""copypasta,"" which is derived from the keyboard action ""copy-paste."" Creepypasta is horror fiction written with the Web in mind and, often, comes in a style that makes it look like a news or true crime story. On Tuesday morning, a lengthy statement about the Wisconsin case appeared on www.creepypasta.com. The statement expressed condolences for everyone involved and stressed that the site does not condone or encourage violence in any way. But it also noted that ""it's hard to justify pinning blame on an entire genre of writing."" ""She loved Creepypasta, she loved the Slenderman stories, just anything a bit creepy,"" William Weier reportedly said. ""But I don't see why it changed from dream to reality."" Planning an attack . Weier and Geyser attended the same middle school as the victim and had a sleepover at the home of one of the suspects Friday night, according to the police chief. According to the criminal complaint, the suspects had been planning the attack since February. They first thought to kill the victim by placing duct tape over her mouth while she was sleeping and stabbing her in the neck, the complaint says. They also considered killing her in a park bathroom where there was a floor drain that could make cleanup easier, the complaint says. The girls ultimately decided to carry out the attack in the park while playing a game of hide-and-seek. ""As they left for the park ... (the victim) was walking in front of them and Geyser lifted up the left side of her white jacket and displayed the knife tucked in her waistband,"" the complaint says. ""Weier stated she gave Geyser a look with wide eyes and, when asked what that meant, Weier stated, 'I thought, dear god, this was really happening.' "" When can kids understand reality vs. fantasy? 'One millimeter away' from death . The victim was stabbed near her heart, and she was ""one millimeter away from certain death,"" the complaint says. When the bicyclist found her, the girl pleaded, ""Please help me. I've been stabbed."" She was in extreme pain and could only answer yes or no questions, the complaint says. Authorities searched for the two other girls, and a sheriff's officer found them walking near Interstate 94, Jack said. He declined to say whether the suspects had blood on their clothes, but added: ""There was evidence that was readily apparent when the two were taken into custody."" That evidence included a large kitchen knife inside a purse, according to the complaint, which Geyser identified as one of her mother's old purses.

"(CNN) -- Jose Maldonado was getting off the bus when the suspects exited the Stockton, California, bank with their hostages. Police had already arrived at the Bank of the West, the witness told CNN affiliate KOVR-TV on Wednesday, but authorities couldn't take out the assailants, not with their guns trained on a customer and two bank employees. ""There was three guys, had three guns and three hostages, and they had the guns to the hostages' heads,"" Maldonado told the Sacramento station. ""They were petrified. Their faces were white. They were just so scared."" Climbing into a Ford Explorer belonging to one of the hostages, the robbery suspects made one of the hostages drive. Police ""surrounded the car, and they just couldn't shoot at them because they were so close to the hostages. They just drove right out of the parking lot,"" Maldonado said. The security guard who called the police had been tied up inside the bank amid frightened patrons and tellers, authorities said. As the suspects fled, a 12-year-old was left stranded in the parking lot after her mother, who had gone inside to withdraw money, became one of the three hostages. The girl texted her father saying, ""They took mom,"" a man who identified himself as Devin J., one of the woman's cousins, told a local television station. For the next hour, police would chase the SUV on surface streets and interstates through Lodi to Acampo, then 20 miles back to Stockton. Gunfire from a semiautomatic ""AK-47-type assault rifle"" and other weapons struck 14 of the 50 or so squad cars that gave chase, police said. Several police cars and an assault vehicle were disabled in the chase and gunfight, police said. What concerned Stockton Police Chief Eric Jones most was the perpetrators' recklessness and wanton violence, he said. Two female hostages either jumped or were thrown from the vehicle -- one shot, one grazed -- and the third victim, the mother, was killed. It wasn't clear whether police or the robbers killed her, but one suspect acknowledged using her as a human shield, Jones said. The other two hostages are expected to survive, he said. Asked why police opened fire on the men when they held a woman hostage, police spokesman Joseph Silva told reporters, ""There was a fear for safety, not only for our officers, but also for the community."" Jones added during a Thursday news conference that it was ""frankly amazing"" no officers were hit, though some had close calls. More than 20 officers were on paid leave as of Thursday per department policy following a shooting, he said. The suspects, who were gang members or associates, were armed to the teeth, the chief said, and appeared to be out for blood. ""The suspects had mass amounts of ammunition, either taped to or strapped to their bodies. The gunfire on our officers was relentless,"" he said. They not only hit homes and cars on busy streets with their bullets, but they also lost police at one point and used the opportunity to attack rather than escape, Jones said. Rather than pressing the pedal to the floor, putting distance between them and the dozens of officers tracking them, they stopped to set up an ambush, he said. ""They briefly lost officers and then stopped off of the roadway off-ramp and turned and had their weapons aimed at the officers who were soon to make the turn looking for them,"" he said. Fortunately, a police commander in an unmarked car saw them setting up their trap and fired on a gunman leaning over the back of the SUV, sparking another pursuit, Jones said. ""That officer likely thwarted a deadly ambush,"" he said. Witnesses abound. Some saw one of the hostages lying on the ground. Others saw officers in hot pursuit through California streets and highways. Many heard the deadly gunbattle that brought the chase to its end. ""It sounded like firecrackers at first,"" one witness told CNN affiliate KCRA-TV. Another told the station, ""I could see the car getting blasted. I could see all the little sparks and everything off the car."" Amateur video obtained by CNN affiliate KOVR shows the final moments. It sounds as if someone set off a long string of firecrackers as puffs of smoke rise from the blue Ford Explorer facing off with police cars. Then the gunfire stops, and the only sound on the video is the wail of police sirens. ""It sounded like five minutes of straight gunfire,"" Sam York told KCRA. ""It seemed like it wasn't real."" One of the suspects had been killed, police said. Another was injured and would die later at a local hospital. Neither has been identified, but one was 27, the other 30, police said. They were both documented members of the NorteÃ±os street gang, and the 27-year-old, the primary shooter, had an arrest record, Jones said. The NorteÃ±os are a problem in Stockton, he said. The surviving suspect, Jaime Ramos, 19, of Stockton was wrapped in a yellow blanket and escorted to a police car, where he was taken to San Joaquin County Jail and booked on felony charges of murder, kidnapping, robbery and attempted homicide of police officers. He is expected to make a court appearance Monday. Ramos is an associate of known gang members, and he revealed to police that he was uninjured in the gunfire exchange because he used the last remaining hostage as a shield, the chief said. Police recovered four guns at the scene, Jones said: the assault rifle, a .45-caliber Glock, a .45-caliber Ruger and a 9-mm Ruger. Many questions remain, namely whether police or the suspects killed the woman found inside the assailants' SUV, but Jones told the media it could take ""some time"" to answer that particular question. His officers, along with state and federal authorities, were investigating every angle, he assured reporters. No matter what they learn, Jones said, one thing is certain: Authorities did not want the situation to end the way it did. ""They put our entire community and nearby communities at risk for a very long time,"" he said. ""We obviously hoped for a peaceful resolution, but these assailants wanted no part of a peaceful resolution."" Suspect in fatal Illinois bank robbery charged . FBI nabs serial bank robbery suspect .

"(CNN) -- The world heard of the plight of a Sudanese Christian wife and mother who, while eight months pregnant, was arrested and sentenced to public flogging followed by execution. Her crime? An Islamic court in Khartoum found her guilty of apostasy, that is, leaving Islam and converting to Christianity. It's a crime punishable by death, according to some interpretations of Islamic law. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim Ishag, 27, who is married to an American, was released, rearrested, and then released again. It's still uncertain whether her nerve-wracking ordeal is over yet. But Meriam's plight is nothing new or isolated. Asia Bibi, a Christian mother of five, has been languishing in prison since 2010, sentenced to death in Pakistan for ""blasphemy."" Her husband and children went into hiding after death threats. 7 terrible countries for Christians . Persecution of Christians is one of the greatest human rights violations in the world today -- and certainly the one least known in the West. Religious hostilities are on the rise around the world, against Muslims, Hindus, Jews, folk religion followers and more. But the situation is so bad for Christians that the normally diplomatic Pope Francis just asserted: ""The persecution of Christians today is even greater than in the first centuries of the Church, and there are more Christian martyrs today than in that era."" To those familiar with the true history of early persecution -- when Christians were habitually tortured to death, set on fire, fed to lions and dismembered to cheering audiences -- his statement may seem exaggerated. But even today, as in the past, Christians are being persecuted for their faith and even tortured and executed. In Egypt, while Christians were ushering in the 2011 New Year, Islamic terrorists bombed the Two Saints Church in Alexandria, killing 23 worshipers and injuring about 100 people. Coptic Christians and Muslims alike protested the bombing. Since then, dozens of Coptic churches have been attacked, some torched to the ground. In August 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood and its Islamist allies attacked and destroyed dozens of churches in retaliation for the Coptic Church's endorsement of the anti-Brotherhood revolution, which was joined by tens of millions of moderate Muslims. In 2010, Our Lady of Salvation Church in Baghdad was attacked during Mass, with 58 worshipers killed and hundreds wounded. Lesser known is that, since U.S. forces ousted Saddam Hussein in 2003, militants have threatened and attacked Christians so often that many have fled the country in fear. In Syria and Iraq alone, Islamists like ISIS have been making life a living hell for ""unbelievers."" In Nigeria, the Islamist organization Boko Haram has in recent years attacked hundreds of churches, reserving the worst attacks on Christmas and Easter church services. A January, 2014, Pew Research Center study on religious discrimination across the world found that harassment of Christians was reported in more countries, 110, than any other faith. Muslims were close behind. Open Doors, a nondenominational Christian rights watchdog group, ranked the 50 most dangerous nations for Christians in its World Watch List. The No. 1 ranked nation is North Korea, then Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, Pakistan, Iran, and Yemen. More disturbing is that three of these countries -- Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya -- were ""liberated"" in part thanks to U.S. forces, while in the fourth, Syria, the U.S. is actively sponsoring the ""rebels,"" many of whom are not even Syrian and some of whom have been responsible for attacks and kidnappings of Christians. It seems that when some Arab states fail, hostilities against Christians rise. Of the top 50 nations documented for their persecution of Christians, 41 are Muslim majority or have sizeable Muslim populations, such as Ethiopia and Kenya. It's important to note that Islamic extremists are the culprits within their borders. Other countries, especially communist ones like North Korea, China, and Vietnam, are intolerant of Christians; churches are banned or forced underground, and in North Korea, exposed Christians can be immediately executed. Nothing integral to the fabric of these societies makes them intrinsically anti-Christian. Something as simple as overthrowing the North Korean regime could possibly end persecution there -- just as the fall of Communist Soviet Union saw religious persecution come to a quick close in nations like Russia, which if anything is experiencing a Christian Orthodox revival. Opinion: Christians face abuse around the globe . The reason Islamic radicals persecute Christians can be traced to culture and politics, but also to extreme interpretations of Islamic religious texts that are used to justify that persecution. The majority of the world's Muslims reject such intolerant readings, but a small minority of Islamists is enough to terrorize the even smaller number of Christians living in Muslim majority nations. One reason Meriam Ibrahim was not flogged and executed might be that her case became a cause celebre, thanks to the media. There is a familiar pattern. Back in September 2012, two other Christians under arrest and awaiting execution in the Islamic world were released. Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani, charged with apostasy and sentenced to death in Iran, was eventually released. A teenage Christian girl known as Rimsha Masih, charged with blasphemy in Pakistan, was freed. In each case, freedom came only after widespread international condemnation. The world must condemn the persecution of all religions -- all cases must be exposed to the light. It's incumbent on nations to control religious discrimination within their borders. And if it's the regime itself that endorses or inflames religious hostilities, the rest of the world must pay attention and denounce it. Most important, Western nations must make foreign aid contingent on the rights and freedoms of minorities. After all, if we are willing to give billions in foreign aid, often on humanitarian grounds, surely the very least that recipient governments can do is provide humanitarian rights, including religious freedom.","Raymond Ibrahim: Sentencing a Christian mother to death is nothing new or isolated .

"(CNN) -- Until recently, fears of peak oil and dependence on Middle Eastern suppliers were the key factors shaping our energy policy, pushing governments to scramble for fossil fuel alternatives. Then came shale gas, tar sands, and other unconventional sources. Industry found ways to affordably extract fuel for decades to come. So many are now imagining an end to the energy crisis. That's a dangerous mistake. First, even the most optimistic predictions leave our grandchildren exposed to an uncertain future. More immediately -- and maybe more importantly -- burning fossil fuels is the number one cause of global warming and its catastrophic consequences. We need to innovate alternative energy sources now more than ever ... and our choices are limited. There are few viable options that will preserve the levels of prosperity that modern industrial economies have come to expect. Solar, advanced nuclear fission, and fusion offer the best hope but, unfortunately, none are ready for large-scale deployment. All need time-consuming innovations so we cannot afford to hesitate; research must be ramped up across the board and government must keep up the pace. Of our three most promising technologies, fusion would be the biggest prize. It is in many respects the perfect energy source. Sea water provides millions of years of fusion fuel. Fusion reactions are safe, they emit neither radioactive waste nor greenhouse gasses and fusion reactors would take up relatively little space. The catch is fusion is very hard to do. Two isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) must be held at 200-million degrees until they collide and fuse to make helium. It is not easy to build a device that runs at ten times the temperature of the Sun, but it is possible. In fact, the European experimental facility, JET -- hosted in the UK, has already done it. For a couple of seconds, it generated 16 megawatts of fusion power -- enough to supply around 8,000 homes. This is an astonishing achievement. We must now extend that duration and power and innovate technologies to make fusion electricity at a price that the consumer will pay. We're working flat out on the first of those goals. Seven international partners representing more than half the world's people are constructing the critical experiment right now in Southern France. Called ITER -- it is designed to reach a self-sustaining fusion burn -- the last scientific hurdle to fusion power. Construction will complete in 2020 with a fusion burn expected by 2030. There are other approaches to fusion -- for example the laser experiments at the National Ignition Facility in California -- but for many of us in the scientific trenches, the fusion burn on ITER is expected to be the defining moment. But what about our second objective of economic viability? ITER isn't meant to achieve that goal. In addition to clearing our last remaining scientific hurdle, we need to advance a parallel engineering agenda into key reactor technologies that will enable commercial fusion power plants to reliably deliver electricity in a highly competitive market. This means technological advances in areas such as structural and functional materials, power conversion, and reliability. China and Korea are on the job but the U.S. and Europe are reluctant to face the engineering issues. Certainly, cost increases on ITER haven't helped. If we continue to starve the technological research agenda of funds, however, we risk delaying fusion power and ceding technological leadership to China and Korea. It goes without saying that resources are limited in our recession-ravaged economies ... but disinvesting in seed corn is obviously self-defeating. What can we afford? The world energy market is approximately €5-€10 trillion ($6.5-13 trillion) a year. The total world spend on energy research is about 0.5% of this -- strikingly low. Fusion research including ITER construction is less than €1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year -- not even 0.05% of the market. We are, it seems, not taking the threat of climate change and energy shortages seriously. In this context, the roughly €200-500 million ($260-650 million) per year needed to vigorously pursue the parallel track of technology innovation in fusion seems absurdly small. We often hear that Thomas Malthus' dire predictions about population growth were wrong because humans innovated solutions to food shortages. Will we innovate ourselves out of our long-term energy constraints too? Only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Cowley.","Fusion power is, in many ways, the perfect energy source, says Steven Cowley .

"(CNN) -- The player tumbles to the ground, writhing around as if he has been mortally wounded. Television replays, however, show that his opponent has made no contact at all. It's an ever-increasing sight on football grounds around the world, and -- in the English Premier League, at least -- it's becoming an increasingly emotive issue. Santi Cazorla was labeled a ""con artist"" after his theatricals earned Arsenal a match-turning penalty kick in a game against West Brom on Saturday. Earlier this season, Liverpool's Luis Suarez was the subject of countless negative headlines as he went to ground in the penalty area, and Tottenham's Gareth Bale has been booked four times for diving -- double that of any other EPL player. The scourge of trying to win free-kicks, and especially penalties, in such a way has long been a thorn in football's side, with fans often outraged by what they see as sporting fraud. CNN's very own Arsenal fanatic Piers Morgan took to Twitter to decry Cazorla's actions, saying he was ""ashamed to see an Arsenal player cheat so badly."" One man who has also never been short of opinions on the subject of cheating is former World Anti-Doping Agency chairman Dick Pound. The Canadian lawyer presided over WADA from its inception in 1999 until 2007, a year when cycling's governing body tried to sue him for critical comments about its former chief Hein Verbruggen. Pound had earned the wrath of Union Cycliste Internationale for saying it could do more to target doping, but his words were comprehensively borne out years later by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency's report into Lance Armstrong, in which everyday items such as butter (apparently short-hand for the hormone EPO) and olive oil (the vehicle for absorbing testosterone) took on very different meanings. Pound believes there are five main reasons why athletes resort to performance-enhancing drugs -- considered by most sports fans to be the worst form of cheating. ""There are reasons but then there are also excuses,"" he told CNN. ""1. A desire to win at all costs -- even if that means lying. 2. For financial reasons -- with professionals trying to extend a career. 3. National pressures -- as exemplified by the old East German system. 4. Individual pressure from coaches -- who get paid better if they coach winners, and that can apply for administrations too. 5. Finally, they dope because they believe they will not get caught -- they believe they are invincible."" On the latter point, the sad truth is that many do successfully beat the drug testers, as did Armstrong and his former U.S. Postal teammate George Hincapie, who confessed all in a plea bargain in October. 'Leveling the playing field' ""Early in my professional career, it became clear to me that, given the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by cyclists at the top of the profession, it was not possible to compete at the highest level without them,"" said Hincapie, who decided to end his 18-year top-level career. His account tallies with the view of Ellis Cashmore, a professor of culture, media and sport at Staffordshire University in England who has conducted research into the use of drugs in sport. ""I don't think there's a conscious motivation when people dope to gain an unfair advantage. My strong belief is that they are trying to level the playing field, knowing that there are so many others doping that they will be disadvantaged if they don't,"" says Cashmore, whose low opinion of drug testers and high hopes for healthier athletes makes him that rarity -- a public advocate for the use of drugs in sports. ""I won't divulge names but one sprinter, who doped with impunity, told me: 'For several years, I was coming fourth or fifth despite training as hard as I could. Yet I knew that the people beating me weren't training as hard nor did they have the same athletic capacity.' "" So the sprinter doped -- with the ""leveling the playing field"" argument used by many sportsmen, including Ben Johnson's coach Charlie Francis, who said the disgraced Canadian was left with no alternative given the riddled nature of athletics at the time he was winning, then losing, the 1988 Olympic 100 meters final. The plunge into drugs is also tempting because it tends to lead to ever-increasing fortunes, with better performances leading to better results and hence greater earnings. ""If you use drugs, it's because you want a shortcut -- a shortcut to everything,"" says South African athlete Hezekiel Sepeng, a silver medalist at the 1996 Olympics whose career ended in controversy when he tested positive for an anabolic steroid. ""Once you start winning, sponsors will be attracted and then money will come. It is an easy way to make money. Some athletes will dope for four to five years without being caught and will make a lot of money in that time,"" the former 800m specialist, now 38, told CNN. ""The big problem in South Africa is that our sportsmen compare themselves internationally. They are young, they've heard about doping and their mind tells them that they need drugs to beat the rest -- it's all about meeting goals and people wanting quick money."" Pre-USADA, Armstrong had amassed a $70 million fortune according to Forbes magazine, while fellow American Marion Jones had several multimillion-dollar sponsorship deals before the sprinter's drug admission prompted her supersonic fall from grace. 'Sophisticated skulduggery' At the other end of the scale, lying to earn more money is rampant in African football, where countless ""promising"" players have concocted false -- and younger -- ages in a bid to appear more enticing to any potential Western suitors (and thus secure a way out of poverty). This year Somalia was thrown out of the 2013 African Under-17 Championship qualifiers, while Niger was disqualified from the 2009 tournament for fielding a 22-year-old and its host Nigeria dropped several of its squad following age tests. While that might seem an almost understandable form of cheating, the infamous actions of Soviet pentathlete Boris Onishchenko at the 1976 Olympics are anything but. The three-time Soviet world champion employed sophisticated skulduggery as he rewired his epee so that it would score points when it did not deserve to, as he tried to turn the silver medal he had won four years previously into gold. His ""desire to win at all costs"" earned him the nickname ""Dis-Onishchenko"" -- though little was heard of him after the Montreal Games. It is unclear whether Onischenko had acted with the help of the Soviet team, a subject that had great relevance at the time given the ideological battles -- and sporting subterfuge -- of the Cold War. Onischenko aside, the 1976 Olympics were also notable for the second-place finish in the medal table achieved by East Germany. A country of just 16 million, it was one of the dominant powers in sports such as swimming and track in the 1970s and early '80s -- which was later explained by the state-sponsored doping system that was uncovered after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Many athletes were unwittingly doped, with British newspaper The Guardian reporting in 2005 that an estimated 800 later suffered serious health issues. The most public face of the scandal was Heidi Krieger, a female shot-putter who was given so many steroids that she later opted to have a sex change and is today known as Andreas. While East Germany's rulers felt sporting glory suitably reflected the successes of their political ideology, so prompting their top-down approach, soccer star Diego Maradona did it the other way -- waging war, quite literally, single-handed. After his ""Hand of God"" goal in the 1986 World Cup helped Argentina beat England, one of football's all-time greats justified his deception by referencing his country's unhappiness over the 1982 Falklands War. Argentina lay claim to the islands, which it calls Las Malvinas, over which the British have sovereignty. As clearly seen, the pressure to succeed often takes sportsmen and women into unexpected territory. We are often told that tiny factors make the difference in top-level sports, yet the measures used to gain them are often anything but insignificant. Examples abound -- but how many can prove the point better than Nelson Piquet Jr.'s intentional crash in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, following team orders, which enabled Renault teammate Fernando Alonso to win the race after the safety car came out? With F1 teams spying on one another, boxers loading their gloves with weights, marathoners crossing the finishing line without running the distance, rugby players using fake blood capsules to feign injury (and so enable a team substitution) and Spain's 2000 Paralympic basketball gold medalists later stripped of their title after nearly all their team were revealed to have no disability, arguably the very concept of ""sport"" has been defeated. There may even be a measure of sympathy for the international sports bureaucracy -- the men and women running global sport's governing bodies. They would seem to need a full-time investigation unit to weed out all the ingenious methods being used to cheat. With that in mind, is it any wonder that FIFA -- as it tackles the debilitating threat of organized match-fixing in soccer -- has enlisted the help of worldwide police agency Interpol in recent years?","Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla's theatrics reignite debate about diving in football .

"(CNN) -- Whether you're a high schooler or Ted Kaczynski, a soccer mom or a Rocky Balboa fan, you've likely embraced the hooded sweatshirt at some point in life. For all its comfort and simplicity, the hoodie leads a dual life. Utilitarian and homogenous in form, hooded garments have been wardrobe staples of monks and hip-hop stars, Silicon Valley programmers and tycoons alike. Yet it still carries a social stigma that has made it the object of legislative bans and political speeches. Now, amid widespread outcry over the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin, the hoodie has become a symbol of social injustice. Focus in Trayvon Martin case shifts to Washington . In the month since the 17-year-old was shot to death by a neighborhood watch patrolman, protesters nationwide have worn hoodies in a nod to the shooter's description of Trayvon Martin. George Zimmerman told a 911 operator that he saw a ""suspicious"" person wearing a ""dark hoodie"" moments before he shot the teen in what he said was self-defense, according to police. Martin's family and supporters said they believe race played a role in the shooting. What witnesses say in the Trayvon Martin case . But those who participated in what have been called ""hoodie marches"" across the country this past week sought not only justice for Martin or possible prison time for Zimmerman. They wore the hoodie in solidarity against racial profiling and Florida's ""stand your ground"" gun law. They marched in the name of anyone who wears hoodies at the risk of being perceived as ""suspicious."" Protesters demand justice . The hoodies continue to show up at rallies, on Senate floors and in churches, and the list of prominent people joining the movement is growing. Clay Aiken wore a hoodie in an interview Monday night on ""Access Hollywood,"" and LeBron James tweeted an image of Miami Heat players wearing hoodies with the words #WeAreTrayvonMartin, #Hoodies and #stereotypes. Former talk-show host Geraldo Rivera triggered a debate over the role Martin's hoodie might have played in his death, opining that ""his hoodie killed Trayvon Martin as surely as George Zimmerman did."" Rivera apologized for his comments, calling them ""politically incorrect,"" but stopped short of retracting his claim that parents of black and Latino youngsters in particular should ""not let their young children go out wearing hoodies."" But, even before that fateful February night, hoodies were already wrapped up in negative racial connotations, said Imani Perry of Princeton University's Center for African American Studies. ""While it is clear that hoodies are a popular form of attire for Americans of all ethnicities and ages, it is a style that has become particularly popular for black and Latino youth,"" she said. ""Because of the pervasive and trenchant racial stereotypes associated with black young people, especially males, their styles are often singled out for criticism, as signs of criminality and misdeeds,"" she said. ""But in truth this is simply another form of stigmatization against the person underneath the clothing, and only superficially has anything to do with the clothing."" Even without the racial aspect, hoodies have an image problem, thanks to their association with criminal activity, said Cynthia Jasper, professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Suspects in hooded clothing frequently appear in surveillance camera footage of armed robberies and law enforcement sketches of wanted criminals. Among the most memorable was Kaczynski, the ""Unabomber"" who engaged in a mail bombing campaign that spanned nearly 20 years but who first entered the public realm in a forensic sketch of a man with hoodie and sunglasses. Hollywood tends to magnify the stereotype by recycling it in scenes depicting violence and crime, furthering ingraining it into the public's collective conscience, Jasper said. People in turn impose those associations onto the wearer, regardless of the person's intention. ""When people interpret your way of dressing, hoodie or whatever, people interpret that as something you control,"" she said. ""You can't control how tall you're going to be or your hair and eyes, but you can control what you put on your body, and your clothing is interpreted as representing who you are."" It's often not a fair association, she said, but it's still the one most people conjure up within seconds of meeting someone as a way of processing and categorizing the person in front of them. ""We have to organize our world, and there's so much that comes before us every single day,"" Jasper said. ""It's a shortcut to help us organize the magnitude of information that comes at us."" The history of the hoodie . Hooded garments weren't always shrouded in nefarious intent, though their function of obscuring the wearer goes back to the Middle Ages, when monks and scholars wore hoods to shield their faces. Hoods served as protective items for farmworkers into the 19th century, worn as part of jackets or overcoats, said Mark-Evan Blackman, assistant professor of apparel design at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. The knitted, hooded sweatshirt was popularized in the 1930s by apparel manufacturer Champion for the working class and evolved into sportswear for the mass market over the course of the 20th century. Hoodies as we know them became part of youth popular culture in the early 1970s in New York when graffiti artists wore them to hide their identities as they ""bombed"" buildings and walls, said hip-hop scholar Halifu Osumare, director of African-American studies at the University of California-Davis. The same era marked the hoodie's major film debut. The 1976 release of ""Rocky"" featured the working-class title character in well-worn gray sweats as he trains through the streets of Philadelphia and makes his memorable ascent up the stairs of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. As hip-hop culture spread in the 1980s, the hoodie became part of the look associated with street style. When hip-hop went mainstream, penetrating homes in white middle-class suburbia and beyond, hoodies remained a key part of hip-hop's global commercialized look, with rapper Eminem memorializing the hoodie's oversize style in the 2002 film ""8 Mile."" Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is another famous white man to make the hoodie a mainstay of his look. When he first entered the public sphere, Zuckerberg was rarely seen without a hoodie, although he has been transitioning to blazers and sport jackets more recently. Nowadays, not a single suburban high schooler, soccer mom or Walmart shopper would seem out of place in a hoodie. Nor would Kanye West, for that matter. Hoodies can be found in big-box stores for less than $10 or emblazoned with the high-fashion logos of Hugo Boss, Ralph Lauren or Juicy Couture for north of $100. The flipside of its generic mainstream appeal lies in its association with crime and mischief. In the last decade, politicians in the United Kingdom, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, endorsed campaigns to ban hooded tops and baseball caps in public places. When current Prime Minister David Cameron was stumping for his party, he argued for addressing the underlying causes of what drove people who wore hooded garments to break the law. Critics branded it Cameron's ""hug-a-hoodie"" message, but he still won office. Even as hip-hop moved away from its urban roots, its ""commodification"" in mainstream pop nurtured the legend of the ""gangster bad man,"" Osumare said. ""The hoodie has become one of those cultural markers of the gangster outlaw. It is part of the construction that happens within capitalism in terms of how things are bought and sold in the marketplace,"" she said. ""So now when people see a black man with a hoodie in the street, it becomes an image of a potential thug or gangster. You have these stereotypical images in mind not of what everyone is actually like but what capitalism has promoted as part of this style trend."" Meanwhile, the hoodie has been appropriated by nearly every fashion genre, from skateboarders to grunge rockers and high-end designers, said Blackman, the Fashion Institute of Technology professor. For some, it's not necessarily a fashion statement but simply a practical garment to be worn as a layer or an overcoat, he said. ""I don't think there's anything intrinsically sinister about hoodies,"" he said. ""But for certain purposes, for certain types of people, the hoodie has wide range of applications."" Indeed, it all boils down to who's wearing it, Osumare said. ""It's all part of the demonization of the black male and the creation of this stereotypical image of him walking down the street in the hoodie,"" she said. ""It happens all the time, and this is what's behind the protests. People don't see it as an isolated incident; they see it as a historic trend.""","Protesters in Trayvon Martin case have worn hoodies in solidarity against racial profiling .

"(CNN) -- They were a Parisian group of artists that gave birth to the Impressionism art movement, so it is perhaps fitting that one of their devotees records the French Open with those broad brushstrokes. Year after year, Joel Blanc makes the short pilgrimage from his Paris studio to the Stade Roland Garros for the tennis year's second grand slam, aiming to encapsulate the tournament's magic onto his canvas. In a style reminiscent of those Impressionist forefathers, he brings to life in his paintings what he witnesses taking place in front of him on the famous red clay courts. ""When I begin the painting, I don't know exactly what will happen but I know what I want to introduce in the beginning. After, it's a story of life,"" he told CNN's Open Court show. ""I know how it begins, but I don't know how it finishes."" A key principle of Impressionism was to paint outdoors rather than inside a studio, so it's a style tailor-made to Blanc's own way of working. It's an approach that has won over tennis stars such as Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal -- both fans and owners of the Frenchman's paintings -- or television companies, who invite him to cover sporting events. Making his first visit to depict the action on the main court of Philippe Chatrier in 2004, Blanc has returned every year since, attracted by both the stadium and the French Open's allure and charm. ""Roland Garros is my favorite place,"" says the 68-year-old. ""It's very special, it's near to my studio, I'm like a neighbor. ""It's like a fascination in Paris, the time of Roland Garros in Paris is very special so there is a real attraction,"" he says. ""I am very proud to be there."" The painter had to wait some time, however, before that short pilgrimage from his studio could become a reality. In the same way that the original artists of the Impressionism movement, established in Paris in the 1870s, initially drew criticism for their apparent trivial approach to art, Blanc had his own detractors -- his parents. They wanted him to forge a career as a surgeon or dentist rather than become an artist -- something that ultimately put him in good stead years down the line. ""I have to thank them for that as they obliged me not to be an artist just like that, they obliged me to learn anatomy at school,"" says Blanc, who was born in Toulon in the south of France. ""But all those years of learning actually gave me the great freedom for painting -- from horses to the body, from landscape to anything I have to draw. I know the proportions, I know everything. I'm able to do it."" From the late 1880s the public's perception became more favorable towards the Impressionism movement, much like the trajectory of Blanc's career. Following an education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Blanc first developed his passion for capturing the moment in equestrian events -- making a living out of depicting horses and their riders. And in keeping with the tradition of Impressionism, he also often found himself recreating scenes from the French countryside. It was not until far further down the line, though, at the age of 57, that Blanc got his real break as an artist when he was invited to cover the World Athletics Championships in Paris in 2003 by French television station France 2. ""I knew this was what I wanted to do. I was supported by the runners as I put all my body into my work, so I was like one of them,"" he recalls. ""This woman asked me to finish a painting and give it to a 100-meter runner at the end, so I finished it in 10 seconds and gave it to him!"" That success prompted another invitation from France 2 to cover the following year's French Open. ""In my work, I need to have a challenge and draw something that other people can't do, so I turned to sport,"" he says. ""What I feel when I do this type of painting is a communion with what I draw. ""I have to be not inside (the athlete) but it's something like communion -- my eyes and my hand. I don't take care of my hand, it's only a problem of mind."" Blanc, who has covered other sports such as golf and rugby, thrives on the unpredictability of capturing these instant action moments. ""Every sport has its own specialty. For example, polo ... it's like a fight, it's very quick and the movement of horses change in a second,"" he says. ""So if you don't decide what you want to represent, it's like rugby, it changes very quickly. If you don't decide quickly, you are lost. You have to clear your mind in every sport."" When Blanc first put his easel on the side of a tennis court, he was unaware of the endless possibilities that were about to unfold both on court and in his mind. ""The first time I thought, like for golf, that tennis was always the same,"" he says. ""I have been painting Nadal and Federer for years and years when they were always in the final, in Monte Carlo and at Roland Garros, and I could say it's always the same story. ""But it's not, because there is an adaption from one to the other and the strategy of each one is very specific, and the movements then change. And the movement has to be taken in the very instant."" Sport is by nature cyclical, adds Blanc, but the same events every year bring fresh inspiration. ""If something new doesn't happen then the people will be bored by that, but every time we all witness something new without fail.""","Joel Blanc paints live at the French Open every year .

Bay Village is a suburb of Cleveland, Carey's hometown and the city where ""The Drew Carey Show"" was based. A video of the prank shows the teen standing outside a garage door in his underwear when someone from the rooftop dumps a bucket of murky brown fluid over his head. The 15-year-old boy's mother told CNN affiliate WJW-TV in Cleveland that the video was discovered on her son's cell phone. ""He was embarrassed because he did not know what the contents were until afterwards, and then he didn't want anybody to know,"" the mother told the station. ""They used his phone to tape it, and they put it up on Instagram."" The stunt appears to be a spoof of the ALS ice bucket challenge in which participants get a bucket of ice water dumped over their heads.

According to the ALS Association, the Ice Bucket Challenge has raised more than $110 million. The Bay Village police said it has been interviewing witnesses and trying to identify those involved. ""Preliminary information suggests this occurred prior to the start of the school year at a home in Bay Village,"" the department said. ""We understand the collective community anger. It is the hope of our community that this anger will be channeled into a positive action and supporting organizations such as Autism Speaks."" The Bay Village Schools superintendent said the school district is ""heartsick over the cruel actions taken against one of our students.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government wants to declassify certain broad statistics about its electronic surveillance programs, hoping to prevent Google and Microsoft from releasing more-detailed information about government data requests, CNN has learned. The government on Friday is expected to ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court -- the secret court overseeing the programs -- to accept its plan as a compromise, a U.S. official with knowledge of the plan said. In the compromise, the government would release how many metadata requests, broken down by types of requests, it has made of telecommunications and Internet companies, the official said. Opinion: Does our government trust us? Metadata includes time and duration of calls, and other basic information -- not the actual substance of the information, which would require a separate search warrant. The court gave the government until Friday to come up with a position on Google and Microsoft's request to release, on their own, statistics on the metadata requests the government made of them under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The data would be broken down by request type -- such as whether they were made through criminal investigations, FBI national security letters or court orders. Microsoft lashed out at the government's moves to limit how much data the companies can release. Brad Smith, Microsoft general counsel, in a blogpost said the company would stand with its rival Google to challenge the government and ""will move forward with litigation in the hope that the courts will uphold our right to speak more freely."" The companies have engaged in talks with government lawyers for weeks. Smith said the companies want to ""publish information that clearly shows the number of national security demands for user content, such as the text of an email,"" separate from metadata requests. He said the companies believe such information can be published without putting national security at risk. Smith said the companies ""remain concerned with the Government's continued unwillingness to permit us to publish sufficient data relating to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act orders...We believe we have a clear right under the U.S. Constitution to share more information with the public. The purpose of our litigation is to uphold this right so that we can disclose additional data."" NSA misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court . The government opposes releasing how many requests it makes to each company. It hopes that the solution it will propose Friday -- releasing statistics on request types in the aggregate, but not company by company -- will suffice. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Thursday that the government would seek to declassify broader statistics. ""Our ability to discuss these activities is limited by our need to protect intelligence sources and methods,"" he said. ""FISA and national security letters are an important part of our effort to keep the nation and its citizens safe, and disclosing more detailed information about how they are used and to whom they are directed can obviously help our enemies avoid detection"" The surveillance programs were brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the United States and is now in Russia under temporary asylum.

"(CNN) -- Labor Day used to be a big deal for the Democratic Party. For much of the 20th century, organized labor was at the heart of Democratic politics. Unions were a driving force that gave the party its heart and its muscle. Unfortunately for Democrats, the importance of organized labor has diminished dramatically since the 1970s. Union membership has declined from nearly 30% of the workforce in the 1960s, according to the Congressional Research Service, to what the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs at about 11% today. Politically, unions have become more controversial among Democrats: Once the status quo among Democrats, now they are often seen as outliers. Many Democrats since the 1960s, including some environmentalists and civil rights advocates, concluded that unions were too often in opposition to their goals. Even though he came from a progressive background, President Obama has repeatedly disappointed union leaders with his failure to support key proposals that would make it easier for unions to grow. The loss of organized labor's clout within the workforce and among the Democrats has been a devastating loss for the party. As the party turned away from this constituency and hesitated to support policies that would reverse the damaging trends that have hindered union membership, they have lost an animating force that could help sustain them in their struggles against a rightward bound Republican Party. The relationship has a long, important history. The union movement was pivotal to the success of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s. FDR and northern Democrats pursued policies greatly benefiting the organization of industrial workers in Northern states like Michigan and Wisconsin. In 1935, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act (also known as the Wagner Act), which formally gave workers the right to join a union and created the National Labor Relations Board, ensuring that employers allowed legitimate elections to take place. In 1936, Roosevelt said: ""The Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom. Labor Day symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality."" While FDR's policies benefited workers, including the new Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, labor came out in droves for the Democrats. They rallied workers on Election Day, encouraged their members to show support for the party that had helped them, raised money to help Democrats succeed, and their lobbyists on Capitol Hill constantly helped round up votes for a liberal agenda that ranged from bills that directly benefited workers to other measures with even greater constituencies. At the height of its power, the civil rights movement relied heavily on union leaders like Walter Reuther to win support for legislation in Congress. Unions were not simply useful allies; their core mission embodied the basic goals of the Democratic Party after FDR. The entire point of collective bargaining was to create an economic system that would ensure a base of financial security for a large number of workers. Unions could fight for the kinds of jobs that would create a ladder for hardworking Americans to enter into the middle class. Without unions and the kinds of policies they helped Democrats find support for, leaders like Reuther realized, there would be very little to prevent the middle class from gradually withering away. From a very early moment in the centuryâ€”long before economist Thomas Piketty was publishing his controversial book on inequality, ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" â€”unions insisted that the organizational basis of economic opportunity depended on workers acting in unison. The situation for organized labor took a terrible turn starting in the 1970s. Many of the industries that were most heavily unionized in Northern states weakened. Owners moved factories and their jobs to Southern states, which had tough right-to-work laws that made it illegal to force workers in an organized workplace to join the union and pay dues, or transported business overseas. Many of the most vibrant parts of the economy, such as the service and high-tech sector, did not offer unionized jobs. Federal policies were no longer hospitable to unions. Conservatives turned to legislation like the Taft-Hartley Act (1947) to squeeze union power. Some workers from unions turned to the Republican Party as part of the backlash to liberalism that unfolded after the 1960s. As labor became less important, a large number of Democrats became cool to unions. President Carter angered union leaders in the late 1970s when he pushed for fiscal austerity and didn't back legislation that would have protected boycotts. President Clinton clashed with unions over issues, including the NAFTA free trade treaty, while President Obama disappointed many when he didn't push for the Employee Free Choice Act in 2009 and 2010. This tension is one that Democrats need to ease. Not only would the party benefit from healthier, more harmonious ties to the union movement, but also benefit from making the expansion of union membership and protection of labor rights a more central part of its national agenda. In an era when so many Americans worry about growing economic inequality and are desperate for answers to how the federal government and the private marketplace can stop the damage to the middle class, stronger support for unions would be a powerful step for Democrats to take. ""As unions shrank,"" wrote Harold Meyerson, ""inequality grew."" Democrats could offer a real alternative. It would offer a stark contrast to a Republican Party that has been extremely aggressive, at the national and state level, in its attacks on unions and the organization of the workforce. Only if Democrats take this step will they be able to nurture the part of their political coalition that was once so strong but is now so frail. Only then will Democrats once again start to celebrate and appreciate the importance of Labor Day to their party.","Julian Zelizer: Democrats and unions used to link their fortunes for mutual gain.

"Paris (CNN) -- A woman stabbed and killed a French kindergarten teacher in her classroom as students watched Friday morning -- the last day of school before summer break, the French education minister said. The teacher, 34, identified only as Fabienne, was stabbed in front of her students, allegedly by a parent of a child who attends the school in Albi in southwestern France, Education Minister Benoit Hamon told reporters at a news conference. A suspect was taken into custody, Hamon said. He didn't name the suspect or talk of a possible motive, but said she was the mother of a child who'd been attending the school only for a month and a half. ""It is my role, and it is the role of the government, to ensure that in the future we better protect our schools and shield (them) from violence,"" Hamon said. Fabienne was married with two young children and was a ""fantastic teacher,"" Hamon said. French President Francois Hollande expressed dismay and said public servants would look after the children who witnessed the killing, according to his office. A psychiatric unit has been set up to assist people in the community, Hamon said. Albi is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northeast of Toulouse.

"(CNN) -- Last week Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas officially submitted the statehood request asking that the United Nations recognize ""Palestine"" as an independent state. But while Abbas's raising of the document during his speech drew applause at the General Assembly, the United States has already promised it will veto the Palestinian statehood bid at a Security Council meeting Monday. Why is this move happening now? The Palestinian Authority leadership says they are making the request for statehood now for a few reasons. Firstly, they argue that over the course of the past two years the Palestinian Authority has made great progress in building the infrastructure necessary for maintaining a sovereign state. They point to the various improvements in governance, security, and physical infrastructure as indicators of their readiness. Palestinians also point to the September 2011 date that U.S. President Barack Obama laid out over a year ago as the deadline for the successful negotiation with Israel for a two-state solution. The Quartet of Middle East peace, made up of the U.N., European Union, Russia, and the U.S. also set this month as the target date for a negotiated deal. With that deadline not having been met Palestinian leaders argue that that the best way to enhance the chances for peace moving forward is for international recognition of a Palestinian state. Who is agreeing with the Palestinians' demand, and who is disagreeing? In the 15-member Security Council, the one body that can confer full U.N. membership, the Palestinians enjoy the support of a majority of the countries. But the United States, which as one of the five permanent members holds veto power, has pledged it will vote down the statehood bid, ending the Palestinians' chance to win full membership. In the General Assembly, where a vote would be non-binding, the Palestinians enjoy the support of more than 120 of the 193 members and passage of a statehood resolution would be all but assured. Why do the U.S. and Israel oppose the call? Both the U.S. and Israel consider the Palestinian strategy a unilateral move that will only hinder the possibility of reaching a peaceful settlement to the Middle East conflict. U.N. action, both countries argue, does not take the place of direct negotiations. Speaking recently to reporters, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: ""We believe strongly that the road to peace and two states living side by side does not go through New York, it goes through Jerusalem and Ramallah."" Israel calls for peace talks amid Palestinian statehood push . Surely, if the U.S and Israel don't agree then it won't mean any difference on the ground? Without the acknowledgement of Israel and the U.S., United Nations recognition of a Palestinian state based on armistice lines that existed before 1967 is largely a symbolic move. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected these lines as the basis for a Palestinian state, calling them ""indefensible."" Therefore the borders, airspace, and movement of people in a new ""Palestine"" would continue to be controlled by the Israeli military and it would be unlikely to change the presence of about 300,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank. If a Palestinian state is recognized, what could that mean for relations/negotiations with Israel? Many believe recognition of a Palestinian state would exacerbate already poor relations between the Palestinian Authority government and Israel. Some politicians in Israel have called for unilateral responses to the Palestinian bid including the outright annexation of territory in the West Bank, the withholding of tax revenue collected on behalf of the Palestinians, and the cancellation of various parts of the 1993 Oslo accords that created the Palestinian Authority. Potential moves like this and what some believe could be a rising level of Palestinian frustration at unmet expectations could add a great deal of tension on the ground and contribute to the possibility of an outbreak of violence. Palestinian Authority leadership maintains that recognition would help put pressure on Israel to be more reasonable in future negotiations. Is there risk in this move for the Palestinian Authority? Beyond the potential response from Israel, the Palestinian bid at the U.N. is risky. The U.S. is opposed to the move and lawmakers in congress have threatened to pull the plug on hundreds of millions of dollars in annual American aid. Others say the move will unrealistically raise expectations of Palestinians and, if little actually changes on the ground, could contribute to regional tensions. The Palestinian Authority could also risk losing support from its own people. The Hamas political faction, which controls Gaza, does not support the U.N. strategy and there are concerns among the Palestinian refugees in the region that the statehood bid could compromise their ""right of return"" to their homeland. Would U.N. recognition give the Palestinians anything substantive? Recognition by the United Nations could potentially give Palestinians greater access to international bodies like the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council. Venues like these could serve as a place for Palestinians to file legal challenges to Israeli practices and exert more international pressure on Israel. What's the current state of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians? Currently there are no talks going on between Israeli and Palestinians. Talks fell apart a year ago over disagreements on the issue of Israeli West Bank settlements. Coming off a self-imposed 10-month halt in settlement construction, Israel said it would not renew the freeze. This led the Palestinians to quit the negotiations. In an effort to head off the Palestinian's statehood request at the U.N. the United States and various European countries have been engaged in 11th hour diplomacy to get the talks restarted but few expect a breakthrough deal.","Palestinians request U.N. recognition of ""Palestine"" as new member state .

"(CNN) -- Budget-conscious travelers rejoice: Hostels aren't what they used to be. Forget cafeteria-style meals, windowless rooms and the college dormitory approach to decor. Think more along the lines of handcrafted cocktails by the pool, complimentary bike rentals and design so stylish you'd swear you were in a boutique hotel.

More often than not, guests will catch a band playing in the bar area or at Gym& Tonic, a small venue within Kex equipped with old-school punching bags (it also doubles as an art gallery and movie theater). Then there's the occasional pop-up concert. In fact, Russell Crowe once showed up to belt out some tunes with rock legend Patti Smith. Even comedian Ben Stiller has been seen there nursing a pint of local stout. Don't worry: There are peaceful activities, too. Like yoga and meditation.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York religious leader pleaded guilty Monday to operating an illegal money business, officials said. Rabbi Saul Kassin, 89, the chief rabbi of the Shaare Zion congregation in New York City, was arrested in an FBI-led corruption investigation in 2009. Kassin admitted in federal court that he accepted bank checks in exchange for checks of a lesser value from a charity he operated and controlled, the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey said. On Monday, he pleaded guilty Monday to illegal cash transmission -- a lesser charge than the original complaint of money laundering, his lawyer Gerald Shargel said. Prosecutors said Kassin operated an unlicensed money transmitting business in his home from mid-2007 through 2008. Using the bank account he controlled for the Magen Israel Society charitable organization, Kassin accepted checks, deducted a 10% commission and then issued the difference to other organizations, authorities said. The rabbi was discovered as part of an FBI undercover investigation, ""Operation Bid Rig,"" which made news in July 2009 when 44 civic leaders and public officials were arrested on the same morning for public corruption and money laundering. Among the 15 arrested for money laundering, five were rabbis who were alleged to have laundered collectively more than $3 million, officials said at the time. Their alleged dealings stretched to Israel and Switzerland, authorities said. One high-profile arrest involved Peter Cammarano, the youngest mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey. He was arrested after just three weeks in office. Cammarano, who accepted $25,000 from a government witness who posed as a real estate developer, was sentenced to two years prison in May. Kassin, who has agreed to forfeit the $367,500 seized from the organization's account in 2009, may face up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He is expected to be sentenced on July 12.","Prosecutors say Kassin operated an unlicensed money transmitting business .

"(CNN) -- It's happened again. A multimillion dollar jackpot is won and I can't help but feel a touch of sympathy and admiration for the winners. Especially the three from Maryland. It's hard to be unaffected by the circus of speculation surrounding them. The rampant jealousy by those commenting is palpable. And the questions. Always the questions like a feeding frenzy. Everyone wants to know how a winner will spend the money. Everyone speculates how they would spend it if they won. It's the ongoing topic of conversation around the water cooler: The heated argument about taking the lump sum or regular payments. And it's all so very familiar. Nineteen years ago my father won the lottery. Three ticket holders split $18 million in the Washington State Lottery. His share was $6 million. Of course now people shrug. Eighteen million is nothing now, right? And $6 million is chump change. But then it was a very big deal. The winners' pictures were in the newspaper. Everyone was interviewed. A reporter asked each one what they were going to do with the money. I wish my father had said, ""None of your business."" I wish my father had said, ""No comment."" I wish he'd had the option of staying anonymous. He mentioned in passing that he was probably going to share it with family. His saying that caused expectations to rise and relatives oozed out of the woodwork. Acquaintances cornered us and shared their financial woes. Representatives of charities and churches descended like a plague of locusts. Our family became the target of scams. From that moment on my identity became permanently entwined with my father's. Not just as his daughter, but as the daughter of a lottery winner. It's a testament to my father's Norwegian heritage that he persevered. Having money didn't change him, but I noticed it certainly changed those around him. It altered people's perceptions of him. After winning the lottery my father was treated like a sage. As if his luck was a talent. Like choosing the correct numbers was a well thought out decision on his part. As a writer I absorbed all this. It even was the subject of a novel I wrote called, appropriately enough, ""Lottery."" The passage of time allows for reflection. After reading about lottery winners who are slain or who commit suicide or go bankrupt, it seems the Maryland trio have it all figured out. Stay anonymous, try not to respond to any questions, and whatever you do, don't quit your day job. For those who still have questions around the water cooler? My father spent some of the money sending family members to college. And he took the payments rather than the lump sum. For the past 19 years he has received more than a quarter of a million dollars a year. He's 91. This year will be his last check. After all this time the furor has died down. I reflect on this and the fact that I wish all the best to the winners and hope they do succeed in remaining anonymous. And I hope their lottery win really does allow them to realize their dreams. By the way, if you're wondering whether I buy lottery tickets, the answer is no. No I don't. I think one lottery winner in a family is enough. Don't you? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patricia Wood.","Patricia Wood: Lottery winners face rampant jealousy and endless speculation .

"(CNN) -- Maybe it was Beyonce, or maybe it was the Beatles. (Actually, it was probably both.) The Grammy Awards attracted 28.5 million viewers to CBS on Sunday night, which is essentially a modern-day record for the annual music awards show. CBS described it in a press release as ""the second largest audience for the awards broadcast since 1993."" Awards shows in general have been on a ratings upswing in recent years. One oft-cited reason is that, since they're big live events, they stand out in an increasingly on-demand television world. Sunday's telecast would have been the biggest since 1993, period, were it not for the tragic circumstances of the 2012 Grammys. That year, Whitney Houston died less than 24 hours before the awards telecast, causing a dramatic surge in viewership the next day. (The average viewership was about 40 million.) The Grammys are typically the second most popular awards show of the year behind the Academy Awards. This year's average viewership was just a smidge higher than last year's average of 28.4 million. (CBS pointed out that a more apples-to-apples comparison was between this year and 2010, the last time the Grammys were scheduled in January instead of February to avoid the Winter Olympics. In 2010, 25.9 million viewers tuned in.) For CBS, the ratings increase this year may justify the network's controversial decision to tape-delay the Grammys in western parts of the United States. Most awards shows are broadcast live coast-to-coast, something that matters more than ever nowadays because millions of people like to converse about the shows on the Internet while they're watching. But CBS continues to delay the Grammys until prime time begins out West, when it says more people are at home and able to watch. CBS' news release on Monday cited data from Nielsen's SocialGuide service that labeled the Grammys ""the biggest social television event of the 2013-2014 TV season to date, with Twitter recording more than 15.2 million tweets during the Eastern and Central time zone broadcast alone."" The network did not say how many tweets there were during the Mountain and Pacific time zone broadcast. With regard to the West Coast tape-delay, Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman, pointed out that the Grammys is a performance-driven show, and that the social media chatter during the East Coast broadcast ""often drives more awareness and interest to viewers elsewhere."" ""We're continuing to do what works, delivering a broadcast that can be watched by the most amount of viewers,"" Ender said.","CBS described it as ""second largest audience for the awards broadcast since 1993""

"(CNN) -- A year ago Wednesday, Malala Yousafzai was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head. She nearly died. Now, the 16-year-old advocate for girls' education is a popular favorite for the Nobel Peace Prize to be awarded Friday. To mark the anniversary of the shooting, her memoir, ""I am Malala,"" came out Tuesday. The phrase has become a battle cry for the right to an education around the world. The memoir follows her odyssey from near-death to global fame in just a year's time. It also gives a vivid account of her everyday life in Pakistan's Swat Valley and how she developed a love for education. Her public fight to get that education and for the right of girls to get one, too, is what put her at odds with the Pakistani Taliban. They banned girls from schools in the Swat Valley in 2009. Malala anonymously blogged for the BBC in opposition to that order, drawing the Islamist militants' rage. Malala turns the other cheek to the Taliban . New threat . The Taliban renewed their death threat against her Monday. Spokesman Shahidullah Shahid said the teenager was targeted because she was used in propaganda against the Taliban. ""If there is any opportunity we can target, she would be on our hit list again."" The Taliban have denied Malala was targeted for promoting education for girls. ""Taliban are not opposed to girls education, if it's within the ambit of Shariah and Islamic education, but they could not support anti-Islamic agendas and Westernized education systems,"" Shahid said. The militant group destroyed over 170 schools between 2007 and 2009, the U.N. said. Malala answers . In an interview with Malala on ""The Daily Show"" on Tuesday, Jon Stewart asked her what she would do if a Taliban assassin came calling again. ""I'll tell him how important education is, and that I even want education for your children as well,"" she said Tuesday. And I would tell him, 'that's what I want to tell you, now do what you want.'"" Fighting the Taliban is important, but through peace, dialogue and education, she said. But the Taliban often prefer to let their guns do the talking. Malala has lived outside of her homeland ever since she was shot last year. Malala at U.N.: The Taliban failed to silence us . Her odyssey . The gunman who climbed on board that school bus wounded Malala in the head and neck. The driver hit the gas. The assailants got away. Malala was left in critical condition. Doctors fought to save her life, then her condition took a dip. They operated to remove a bullet from her neck, and as brain swelling threatened her life, a surgical team cut out a section of her skull to relieve the pressure. After surgery, she was unresponsive for three days. She was flown to the U.K. for intensive medical treatment and multiple surgeries to repair the damage the bullets had done. Doctors there covered the large hole in her skull with a titanium plate. Malala has kept the piece of skull that had been removed as a souvenir of her fight. It is nothing short of a miracle that the teen education advocate is still alive and even more astounding that she suffered no major brain or nerve damage. Global stage . The attempt on Malala's life propelled her and her cause onto the global stage. Beyond her hospital room in her new home in the UK, a world sympathetic with her ordeal transformed her into a global symbol. An avalanche of support poured in, including from world leaders. The U.N. started a global education program for girls called ""I am Malala,"" the name she has chosen for her biography. This year, the Malala Fund was created to support education for girls around the world. She recovered and addressed the United Nations in New York on her 16th birthday, July 12. ""They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed,"" she said. ""And then, out of that silence, came thousands of voices."" Gordon Brown: How Malala forced terrorists onto defensive .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- In Japan, a country where structure, conformity and security are bedrocks, it is often hard for individuals to break free and follow a more idealized path. It is especially difficult when that path turns out to be somewhat ... eccentric. So we salute Hideaki Kobayashi, who took the courageous step a few years ago of dressing up -- like a 15-year-old schoolgirl. Complete with ponytail, knee-high socks, penny loafers and a cute red kerchief, his outfit is the epitome of Japanese girls' school uniforms. His thinning white hair and beard, which frame his round, middle-aged man's face, however, add something a little different to the look. By and large, he's found that his unusual appearance, which he says makes him ""feel comfortable,"" is accepted on Tokyo's streets. Now a patent-holding computer engineer, an accomplished photographer and presumptive music producer, Kobyashi's life hasn't always been this way. ""When I was in university I majored in mathematics and I was very introverted,"" he tells me as people crowd round to take photos -- he poses for up to 100 a day. ""I never talked to people. I feel much more myself wearing this. ""Japan(ese) society is all about conforming to the other people. (Japanese people) feel suffocated conforming to society."" For such a conservative country, the capital does have pockets of individuality, especially around the Harajuku area, where tourists often gather to snap pictures of some of the city's more out-there residents. Cosplay is a big thing in Japan, and many enthusiasts gather in the neighborhood's Yoyogi Park to show off their ensembles. But even here, the 51-year-old stands out. Certainly Kobayashi's style is unique, and draws a lot of attention, even in Harajuku. He tells me that it took him two hours to walk from Shibuya's famous crosswalk to the neighborhood, usually a 15-minute stroll, because of all the people stopping to take photos with him. ""Comfortable, relaxed and happy"" Lola Fantappie, a tourist from California, encountered Kobayashi in the Akihabara district, the beating heart of Japan's otaku (geek) culture and no stranger to societal outliers. She says that she was struck by his contentedness. ""He just seemed so comfortable, relaxed, and happy... I don't know, embracing life. I think it's great."" And his unique take on life -- and dress code -- has garnered some unlikely admirers. Waseda Juku, a private tutorial center in Tokyo, might be a far cry from the Japanese public school system, which still largely operates by the old maxim, ""the nail that sticks out gets hammered down,"" but still, to draft in an elderly cross-dresser as a motivational speaker is a huge step for a Japanese educational institution. The school's staff learned of Kobayashi's many talents, and Alexander Blackhall, an administrator at the school, said they were drawn to the ""rich character behind the facade"" as well as the potential this brave man had to teach their charges something about being themselves. ""(He) just sends such a positive message,"" Blackhall says. ""It's really useful to young people, particularly here in Japan -- this voyage of self discovery."" Kobayashi calls it the key to a rich and happy life. ""If thereÂ¹s something you want to do, do that,"" he says. 'Be yourself' Historically, cross-dressing has played an important part in Japanese culture. Onnagata -- male kabuki performers who played the female role -- were, and remain, a staple of the art. A more modern flip-side to this can be found in the Takarazuka revue, an all-female troupe which acts out campy musicals using an all-female cast in the town of Takarazuka in Osaka prefecture, as well a satellite theater in Tokyo. Variety shows on TV here also mine a rich seam of cross-dressing, and it's common in anime (Japanese cartoons) as well as manga (comic books). But while men dressing as women is accepted in Japanese pop culture, Kobayashi says that real life reactions can be different -- he says sometimes people shout insults on the street, and notes that he's been stopped by the police as many as ten times. Despite the negative attention and discrimination, he thinks it's worth it. It's still outweighed by the positivity of the throngs of people eagerly posing with him as he skips from Shibuya to Harajuku, and by the kids he's able to reach with his message of tolerance, and how liberating being a non-conformist can be. He says his story proves you donÂ¹t have to be conventional to be accepted. ""ThatÂ¹s my message,"" he says. ""Be yourself.""

"Paris (CNN) -- Christian Dior has started proceedings to fire designer John Galliano after he was filmed making anti-Semitic comments in a Paris restaurant, the fashion giant said Tuesday. The company condemned his ""deeply offensive statements and conduct"" in a statement announcing the plan to fire him. The statement came hours after Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman condemned Galliano's praise of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. ""I love Hitler,"" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. ""Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead."" The comments were reportedly made at a Paris cafe last year. Galliano's lawyer, Stephane Zerbib, said Tuesday that Galliano formally denies that he is anti-Semitic. Zerbib declined to comment further. ""I am deeply shocked and disgusted by the video of John Galliano's comments that surfaced today,"" said Portman, who appears in ads for Miss Dior Cherie perfume. ""In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr. Galliano in any way. ""I hope at the very least, these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful,"" she said. Before the video surfaced on Monday, Christian Dior already had suspended Galliano for allegedly making anti-Semitic remarks in another incident. The fashion house said Friday that Galliano was suspended from his duties pending the outcome of an investigation into remarks the designer allegedly made last week. Galliano was arrested Thursday night following an argument in a bar in Paris' Marais district, a prosecutor said. Police arrested him on charges of assault and making anti-Semitic comments after a couple pressed charges. The designer was taken to a police station, and a test revealed he had a high level of alcohol in his blood, the prosecutor said. Galliano has been released but may be summoned in the coming weeks. Zerbib said his client has denied the accusations. Announcing Galliano's suspension, Dior President Sidney Toledano said, ""The House of Dior declares with the greatest firmness its policy of zero-tolerance regarding any anti-Semitic or racist statement or attitude.""

"(CNN) -- On June 28, 2007, Nokia was the top selling mobile-phone company in the world, people stopped working when they left their computers, Android phones didn't exist, and high-powered executives were addicted to thumbing on their BlackBerrys. The next day, Apple's first iPhone went on sale. At $600, it was a luxury item at first. But five years later, the phone's dramatic impact can be seen in our daily lives, schools, factories and boardrooms. To date, more than 217 million iPhones have been sold, and they're being used by construction workers to read blueprints, doctors to diagnose patients, governments to improve services and parents to quiet their kids in restaurants. To ring in its 5th birthday, here are five ways the iPhone has made a mark on the world. Photos: Our mobile 'addiction' A new way of interacting with computers . In 2007, we were a nation of skilled texters, banging out OMG-filled coded messages at lightning speeds on numerical keypads and physical keyboards. The iPhone was lacking either of those, instead offering a nothing-but-screen keyboard. It was a classic Apple move toward dead-simple usability, and it helped bring a slice of computing to a whole new audience, including technophobes, kids, senior citizens and people with visual or hearing impairments. Suddenly, users could navigate their phones with a few swipes of the finger. Kids intuitively seemed to know how to use it. And the phone ushered in a new wave of touchscreen devices. After the hefty price tag, the lack of a physical keyboard was the first complaint many reviewers lodged against the iPhone. It didn't scare off consumers, though, and Apple sold a million iPhones in less than three months. Typing speeds on the iPhone still may not rival a pair of BlackBerry thumbs at their peak, but predictive-text software, spell check and, later, cut and paste have made it a usable alternative. In October, Apple tried to shake up input again with the introduction of the Siri voice-assistant feature. The voice-recognition technology encouraged users to speak commands and questions instead of of tapping them in on the screen. Rise of the app . The iPhone's killer feature was not that tough, expansive glass touchscreen. It was the mobile operating system, iOS, and the tightly controlled App Store released a year later in 2008 that made the iPhone into, well, whatever you wanted it to be. The original device was useful enough: It shipped with a built-in Apple apps for checking the Internet, weather, e-mail, texts, stocks, calendars and the time. But when the App Store opened, people suddenly had access to a stockpile of well-designed third-party apps, and developers were able to build an astonishing variety of custom apps. With the right app, an iPhone could track the sun, sync shopping lists, be a drum machine, take restaurant reservations, be a cash register. Meanwhile, Apple's TV ads made ""there's an app for that"" into a catchphase and a headline cliche. In classic Steve Jobs style, Apple took complete control of the sales and app-approval ecosystem. Apps have to be approved by Apple before they can be sold, meaning fewer spam apps and viruses make it through to consumers. It also means the company can reject apps as it pleases -- say, when a feature competes with an Apple product -- to the occasional displeasure of the developer community. The App Store has also created a new mini-economy. Apple has paid out more than $5 billion to developers, and that's after taking a 30% cut off all app sales for itself. Today, there are more than 650,000 mobile apps available in the App Store, ranging from free to $1,000 for specialized business applications. 24/7 Internet . The iPhone ushered in an age of all Internet, all the time. For better or worse, it's blurred the lines between work and home lives, made communication a round-the-clock habit and led to a host of new rules about when and how it's appropriate to use smartphones (not while walking, driving, playing trivia or on a date, please). The phone, whose price soon dropped to $200 or less with a two-year wireless contract, gave users instant access to a multitude of ways to communicate: texts, e-mail, Twitter, Instagram, Grindr, Foursquare, Facebook, FaceTime. There's even a so-so phone on there. Mobile phones had limited Internet access before the iPhone, but the device's browser was a huge improvement, displaying webpages more like they actually looked on a desktop computer. All this connectivity brought a new disorder: smartphone addiction. A recent study by gadget-resale site Gazelle found that 15% of respondents would rather give up sex than go without their iPhones for a weekend. That type of titillating stat is not surprising to anyone for whom the iPhone is the last thing they see at night and first thing they check in the morning. Supply-chain activism . As Apple grew from underdog into the largest company in the world by market cap (it made $108 billion in 2011), its manufacturing chain was pushed to greater and greater limits -- and into the spotlight. The Foxconn plants in China that produce Apple's iPhones, iPads and other products were called out in the press and by activist groups for poor working conditions, long hours and low wages. While bad press for Apple, the controversy drew much-needed attention to electronics supply chains. The Foxconn plant was called out for producing Apple products, although it also assembles products for other major electronics companies including Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony and Intel. To quell the backlash, major tech companies are feeling the pressure and changing how they operate. When he took over as Apple CEO, Tim Cook agreed to allow a third party, the Fair Labor Association, audit its China factories and address any issues that were found. And just this week, Google unveiled a media-streaming device, the Nexus Q, which is made in the U.S. An industry revived . The iPhone may have helped kill the BlackBerry, but it gave birth to a new beefed-up genre of mobile devices. Google went on to release its own more developer-friendly mobile operating system, Android. Microsoft threw its hat into the ring with Windows Phone OS. Most major mobile phone companies now produce touchscreen smartphones. Some might say the iPhone and its cousin, the iPod Touch, helped spawn the larger iPad, with its identical touchscreen interface. That hit device was birthed in 2010 and quickly created a new gadget market, leaving rivals scrambling to catch up. Now Amazon, Google and Microsoft all have new or forthcoming tablets. The iPhone's popularity as a portable gaming device -- oh, how we love flinging virtual birds at virtual pigs! -- also helped usher in a new era of mobile gaming. Five years after the iPhone hit the market -- and the culture -- the tech industry as a whole is thriving and innovating. It probably won't be another five years before the next big thing shakes up technology again.

"(CNN)  -- Howard Unruh, a World War II veteran accused of killing more than a dozen people in a deadly shooting spree in New Jersey 60 years ago, died Monday, authorities said. He was 88. Howard Unruh died Monday in a nursing home in Trenton, New Jersey. Although he was never found competent to stand trial, authorities and witnesses say Unruh methodically walked Camden's 32nd Street on the afternoon of September 6, 1949, targeting several business owners on a hit list and firing at others who crossed his path, including children. The weapon of choice was a German-crafted Luger pistol. The last victim was 2-year-old Tommy Hamilton, who happened to be looking out the window, according to accounts of the 20-minute spree compiled by TruTV's Web site. (TruTV, like CNN, is a part of Turner Broadcasting.) Another boy was killed while getting a haircut. The barber, 33-year-old Clark Hoover, had been on the list. Though the case never went to trial, Unruh was considered by some as the first single-episode mass murderer in the United States. Unruh's mental status was reviewed by the courts, reviews that always resulted in his continued commitment, according to the Camden County prosecutor's office. He died Monday at Providence Nursing Home in Trenton at 3:35 p.m. after an extended illness, officials said. Ron Dale was inside a shoe shop off 32nd when the gunman came through the door and fired twice at shoemaker John Pilarchi, 27, who died instantly. ""He shot the shoemaker, turned around, looked at me and walked out the door,"" Dale, who was 8 at the time, told CNN Radio. ""It just wasn't my turn."" It was the weekend before school started. Dale said he ran home but knew that his big brother and other kids would be getting haircuts and doing other stuff for first day of school. ""Back in those days, there was no such thing as people going around with guns like they do today,"" said Dale, now a military veteran and retired ironworker. Even as police scrambled to catch the gunman, he reached his apartment, where he barricaded the door. Witnesses had identified the shooter as Unruh, described as 28-year-old recluse and ""religious nut,"" according to the accounts compiled by TruTV. Dozens of police officers surrounded the two-story building that housed Unruh's apartment, which sat next to the pharmacy owned by Maurice and Rose Cohen. The couple and Maurice Cohen's mother were all killed in the spree, but their 12-year-old son, Charles, survived by hiding in a closet. Officers, armed with rifles and machine guns, riddled the building with bullets. He finally surrendered after police tossed cans of tear gas through a bedroom window. During questioning, he gave County Prosecutor Mitchell Cohen a play-by-play of the massacre, according to the Tru TV accounts. Unruh had left his home that day, he told Cohen, with one bullet in the chamber, 16 loose bullets and two clips of eight, because his neighbors ""had been making derogatory remarks about my character."" After a battery of tests were conducted, Unruh was diagnosed with ""dementia praecox, mixed type, with pronounced catatonic and paranoid coloring"" and was ruled criminally insane, making him immune from prosecution. Ron Franscell, a Texas-based author, has researched the Camden massacre for a book about victims who have survived mass killings in modern American history. He's walked Unruh's ""walk of death"" and interviewed several witnesses of the shooting. Franscell described Unruh as a strange character who was a good soldier in World War II. ""But he does odd things while he's there; he keeps detailed notes of the Germans he kills,"" he told CNN Radio on Monday. He returned home a changed man. Unruh was an introvert in his neighborhood, known to dress up in a suit and tie, with combat boots and a Bible tucked under his arm. He would walk around the streets and quote scripture, Franscell said. ""He's not right. ... He just came back a little different."" Among the Camden survivors Franscell spoke with was Charles Cohen, the son of the slain pharmacist. Franscell said Cohen coped by stashing scores of newspaper clippings on the 1949 shooting into a suitcase. Through the years, Cohen ""really saw a day in the future when Howard Unruh would die and he saw it as a release for him,"" Franscell said. ""His hope was to see Howard Unruh's day come so he could take that suitcase out and bury it. Cohen never saw that day. He died two months ago. CNN Radio's Ninette Sosa contributed to this report.","Howard Unruh accused of killing more than a dozen people in New Jersey in 1949 .

"(CNN) -- Arizona set itself up for yet another self-inflicted political wound, international humiliation, costly boycotts and historical shame now that its legislature has passed a bill giving people the right to discriminate. The bill was written by the Center for Arizona Policy and a Christian legal organization called the Alliance Defending Freedom. They were inspired, in part, by the case of a New Mexico wedding photographer who was taken to court after refusing to shoot a gay commitment ceremony. The bill seeks to shield Christians from members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community who dare to seek equal protection under the law. Specifically, the bill protects all individuals, businesses and religious institutions from discrimination lawsuits if they can show that their discriminatory actions were motivated by religious convictions. Under the guise of religious freedom, however, the bill would enable businesses potentially to discriminate against virtually anyone -- not just Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, agnostics and atheists, but also unwed mothers, Rastafarians and Budweiser T-shirt wearers. This bill is arbitrary, capricious and antithetical to the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood that inform our documents of freedom. It will lead to marginalization and oppression by allowing bigots to deny gay people access to virtually any business or service. The road to Indian genocide, Jim Crow, Japanese-American internment, the Holocaust and other iterations of human persecution began with laws that isolated and dehumanized entire groups of people. Arizona's race relations and cultural politics are often misunderstood by the rest of the country. Racial diversity and progressivism exist within the predominantly white and conservative power structure of the Grand Canyon State. This has created an interesting dynamic. Arizona has sometimes made racial and cultural inroads ahead of the national curve, while fear of major demographic shifts, including a growing LGBTQ community, and the erosion of white privilege have unearthed racial stereotyping, homophobia and xenophobic policies. Many outside the state misunderstand this dynamic, assuming we are a wholly backward place without understanding that it is much more complicated than that. Nevertheless, Arizona now has the dubious designation as the first state to pass an anti-gay bill that seeks to shun and segregate in the name of religion. Similar legislation has been put forward in Idaho, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee. The Arizona measure is the only bill that has passed. There is a saying: ""history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes."" The rhythm of chauvinism and acrimony in Arizona endures. The state long resisted creating a holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., which it finally did in 1992. It is not too late to shift course, however. Gov. Jan Brewer has the power to put Arizona back on the right side of history. The ""right to discriminate"" bill now sits on her desk. The bill passed Thursday, She has five days to reject it or sign it into law. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew C. Whitaker.","Matthew Whitaker: Arizona legislature approved a bill that would allow discrimination .
He says the bill shields those who show religion prompts their discrimination .
He says bill aimed at LGTB community but could affect many groups .
Whitaker: Arizona complicated, not as biased as often depicted ."
"(CNN) -- Many beloved books, new and old, are being transformed in movies this year. Tales from Lois Lowry's classic young adult tale ""The Giver"" to the popular dystopic novel ""Divergent"" are making feature film debuts.

Cast: Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin . What it's about: A 13-year-old boy and his depressed, divorced mother (Winslet) encounter an escaped convict (Brolin) who becomes part of their lives and initiates a romance with the boy's mother. What to expect: Directed by Jason Reitman (""Juno,"" ""Up In the Air""), the film version seems like a romance-soaked melodrama. One of the film's key scenes centers on pie-making and has been turned into a marketing campaign urging fans to make the ""Labor Day"" peach pie. ""Vampire Academy"" Author: Richelle Mead . Movie release date: February 7 . Cast: Zoey Deutch, Lucy Fry, Sarah Hyland . What it's about: Part of a six-book series, ""Vampire Academy"" centers on young vampires who are trained keep the peace against a group of evil bloodsuckers. The first incarnation follows a half-vampire/half-human named Rose Hathaway who is tasked with protecting a princess. What to expect: The film falls somewhere between ""Twilight"" and ""Clueless,"" with paranormal teens and the tagline ""They Suck at School."" It's also a new look for ""Modern Family"" star Sarah Hyland, who puts her fast-talking teen skills to fresh use. ""Winter's Tale"" Author: Mark Helprin . Movie release date: February 14 . Cast: Colin Farrell, Jessica Brown Findlay, Russell Crowe . What it's about: A gang member named Peter Lake encounters a beautiful woman while attempting to rob her house in the early 20th century. After falling in love, he finds out she's dying from consumption. After her death, Peter gains mysterious powers and sets out to save her.

Movie release date: March 21 . Cast: Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Kate Winslet . What it's about: In a dystopic version of Chicago, people are split into seven clans based on their personality traits. A young girl named Beatrice Prior (Woodley) is marked as a ""divergent"" who doesn't fit into one category, kicking off a rebellion against the sect-driven government. What to expect: This is the first adaptation in the ""Divergent"" trilogy, and it looks to be an epic young adult action film on the level of ""The Hunger Games."" The film will probably be one of the biggest book-to-movie editions of the year, based on the popularity of the series. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" Author: John Green . Movie release date: June 6 . Cast: Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort . What it's about: A 16-year-old cancer patient named Hazel (Woodley) falls in love with another patient.

The book follows the family's unlikely aptitude for French cuisine and their rivalry with French chef Madame Mallory. What to expect: Oprah Winfrey is among the film's producers, so the adaptation will probably be heartwarming and family-friendly. Mirren plays the commanding Madame Mallory and has presumably been working on her French accent. ""The Giver"" Author: Lois Lowry . Movie release date: August 15 . Cast: Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsgard, Taylor Swift . What it's about: In a dystopian future, society has eliminated pain, emotion and color. A young boy named Jonas is named the Giver, a position responsible for keeping the memories of the community safe. The young adult novel follows his struggle to abide by the strictures of society. What to expect: Most of the film's hype has come from the casting of Swift in a bit part, but the 1993 novel has been a longtime favorite and will probably be more centered on Jonas, played by newcomer Brenton Thwaites. It will be interesting to see how director Phillip Noyce handles the book's explanation that there is no color in this society. ""This Is Where I Leave You"" Author: Jonathan Tropper . Movie release date: September 12 . Cast: Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Rose Byrne, Adam Driver . What it's about: Four siblings reunite in their childhood home after the death of their father to sit shiva for a week in the Jewish tradition. As they fulfill their father's last wish, problems from the past are confronted. What to expect: Director Shawn Levy helmed comedies ""Date Night"" and ""The Internship"" so will naturally embrace the humorous nature of the story. Plus, the pairing of Fey and Bateman should be undeniable. ""The Maze Runner"" Author: James Dashner . Movie release date: September 19 . Cast: Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario . What it's about: The first in a series of young adult books, ""The Maze Runner"" follows a group of teenagers who wake up in a place called the Glade that exists inside a giant maze. The group has to deal with power issues as well as how to escape the maze (and why they are in there to begin with). What to expect: An action-packed thriller akin to ""The Hunger Games,"" with more mystery about what's going on in this dystopic society. The cast is mostly unknowns, which may make this a star-making flick. ""Gone Girl"" Author: Gillian Flynn . Movie release date: October 3 . Cast: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike . What it's about: The popular novel follows the troubled marriage of Nick and Amy Dunne. On the eve of their fifth wedding anniversary, Amy goes missing, and Nick becomes the prime suspect in her possible murder. What to expect: Flynn wrote the screenplay and has said she veered away from the book's surprise ending for the movie version. David Fincher, who also directed the adaptation of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" will probably bring a dark sensibility to the movie. ""Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" Author: Judith Viorst . Movie release date: October 10 . Cast: Jennifer Garner, Steve Carell, Bella Thorne . What it's about: The funny children's picture book tells the tale of 11-year-old Alexander's worst day as he deals with a series of unfortunate events like waking up with gum in his hair. What to expect: The film will expand on the classic book, detailing how Alexander's family members are also having their own terrible, horrible days. Garner and Carell play Alexander's parents, perfect for some kid-friendly comedy. ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1"" Author: Suzanne Collins . Movie release date: November 21 . Cast: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth . What it's about: The final book in ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy has been split into two movies, so Part 1 will tell only the initial half of Katniss Everdeen's rebellion to overthrow the Capitol in the aftermath of the Quarter Quell shown in ""Catching Fire"" last year. What to expect: It's hard to know how much of the story this film will recount, but expect more audacious costumes in the Capitol and more intensity from Lawrence as she channels Katniss' struggle to become the rebellion's leader. Part 2 won't come until 2015.","Many classic books will be made into films this year .
The batch kicks off with ""Labor Day,"" released on January 31 .
Culminates in highly anticipated ""Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1"" in November ."
"(CNN) -- Hundreds of student protesters barricaded inside Taiwan's Legislature for the past four days say they are disappointed by the government's failure to respond to their ultimatum Friday. The demonstrators, mostly university students, are protesting against the ruling party's push for a trade pact with China, which they claim will hurt the island. The movement has been dubbed the ""Sunflower Revolution"" by Taiwanese media. The group leading the protest -- The Coalition of Student and Civic Groups against the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement -- announced the ultimatum on Thursday, demanding that President Ma Ying-jeou withdraw the controversial trade agreement and issue an apology by noon Friday. As the deadline passed, no direct response from Ma was given, and student protesters appeared on Taiwanese television expressing their disappointment. They said they would continue to occupy Legislature and would announce their next move at a press conference to be held at 6 p.m. local time (E.T. 6 a.m.) Friday. The protesters entered the main assembly hall inside the Legislative Yuan in Taipei on Tuesday night and blocked the entrances with chairs, according to images and accounts filed from the scene with CNN iReport. Police responded but had not dispersed the protesters, who also filled the streets around the Legislature in the center of Taipei. By March 19, Taiwan's state news agency reported that 38 police officers were injured when more than 400 protesters took over the Legislature. Four protesters were arrested in two unsuccessful attempts to evict them, the news agency reported. Police said there were more than 2,000 protesters both inside and outside the building, with a equal number of officers on the scene. ""We do not want to clash with the police,"" said protester and iReporter Shanny Chang, 19. ""We just have to let the government know that never try to fool the people."" One CNN iReporter said that after the protesters took over, hundreds gathered outside the building, with some making speeches and singing songs. In a video, a young woman sings Bob Dylan's song ""The Times They are a-Changin',"" which many associate with the protest spirit of the 1960s. ""She played the Dylan song because she thinks the lyrics match the ongoing events happening in Taiwan,"" said iReporter George Chang, 24, who shot the video. ""Bob Dylan isn't really that popular in Taiwan, especially not to the 8th grade generation, what Taiwanese call children born after 1991, but to the older generations I think he isn't a stranger to them."" The trade pact was signed last year in Shanghai to ease investment and trade between the two longtime adversaries, mainland China and Taiwan. But opponents have voiced concerns that not only will Taiwan's economy be hurt as businesses and investments flow to China, but the island's democratic system could be undermined by closer ties with the mainland. ""The trade agreement was not supervised by the people of Taiwan, and benefits only big companies and harnesses our jobs,"" Chang wrote. ""But I do agree we need to open Taiwan to the world, even China too. But NOT this way, not by signing an agreement that is not fair to us and was negotiated by people who have no profession in these territories. We must rewrite the agreement and make it work for the both of us, towards a peaceful future between the strait of Taiwan."" An iReporter identified as kwarrior, an Asian-American living in Taiwan, wrote that the government's handling of the trade agreement ""was unconstitutional and a blatant violation of the people's rights. ... I care deeply because my parents are Taiwanese and they always loved their nation like no other. I am personally affected because I value the rights of the people to voice and make changes in a democratic country."" In a statement, Amnesty International urged security forces to show restraint. ""The situation is clearly tense. ... While police have a duty to maintain order and to protect the safety of the public, the response must only be proportionate to the threat. Force should only be used as a last resort. The authorities must ensure the rights of all those protesting are upheld and respected,"" said Roseann Rife, the group's East Asia research director. Last month, Taiwan and China held their highest-level talks in more than six decades, marking the first government-to-government contact since the pair's acrimonious split in 1949. Wang Yu-chi of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees the island's China policy, met with his mainland counterpart, Zhang Zhijun of China's Taiwan Affairs Office. After the meeting, China's state news agency Xinhua said the two sides had agreed to open a regular communication channel. ""We should both be resolute to not let cross-strait relations suffer any more twists and turns and never let (the relationship) go backward,"" Zhang was quoted as saying. Previous contact between the two sides has been conducted through semi-official foundations or through political parties, not by government ministers acting in their official capacities. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has never ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. Taiwan also calls itself the Republic of China. Relations between the two sides have improved since Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou came to power in 2008. On Wednesday, Ma called for the passage of the trade pact. CNN's Rachel Rodriguez, Maggie Blaha and Daphne Sashin contributed to this report.","Student protesters' ultimatum to Taiwan's government passes without a response .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch could be put up for sale, according to the investment company that owns a controlling interest in the estate. The 2,700-acre property, nestled in the rolling hills and cattle ranches of Santa Barbara County, California, was Jackson's refuge from the world from 1988 until he essentially abandoned it after he was acquitted on child molestation charges in 2005. The zoo and amusement park rides, including a Ferris wheel and a railroad, are long gone, but Neverland remains an important pilgrimage for die hard Jackson fans from around the world. A constant flow of flowers, cards and gifts are left at the closed gate. Tom Barrack's Colony Capital got a major stake in property when it bailed Jackson out of financial trouble in 2008, a year before the singer died while preparing for a comeback concert tour. Barrack ""is considering"" selling he rural property, which is surrounded by rolling hills and cattle ranches, but it has not yet been listed for sale, according to Owen Blicksilver, the spokesman for Colony Capital. A video tour inside Neverland . Jackson's estate still owns a minority interest in Neverland, but there is no indication from its executors that they are considering buying out Colony Capital's stake to preserve it. ""We are saddened at the prospect of the sale of Neverland which, under the agreement negotiated during Michael's lifetime, Colony has the right to sell,"" the Jackson estate said in a written statement Thursday. The estate's statement said it would ""maintain Michael's family home in Encino, including its iconic recording studio there,"" as part of his legacy. It also pointed to other legacy projects such as Cirque du Soleil's Michael Jackson ONE show in Las Vegas. ""We hope and trust that any new owners of Neverland will respect the historical importance and special nature of this wonderful property,"" the Jackson estate said.Â ""Michael's memory lives on in the hearts of his fans worldwide."" Jane Fonda: Jackson bought Neverland after visiting my ranch . While Jackson vowed in his last years to never return to Neverland, some of his family members pushed for his burial there after his sudden death on June 25, 2009. He was finally entombed at Forest Lawn in Glendale, California. Jackson was close to losing the land in 2008 when Barrack agreed to put up a reported $35 million to pay the mortgage and help fund the entertainer's lifestyle. The deal gave Barrack's Colony Capital control of the property. Jackson's death from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic came during preparations for his ""This Is It"" tour set to debut in London in July, which Jackson hoped would revive his performance career and restore is wealth. Colony Capital has paid the salaries of the small staff that maintains Neverland, including the security needed to keep the curious out. What could become of Neverland with a new owner? The area is home to a lot of grazing cattle, although a few miles away several hotels and restaurants thrive in the Danish-themed tourist village Solvang. A California state legislator proposed in 2010 that the California Department of Parks and Recreation should consider acquiring Neverland as a state park. The proposal was never pursued.","Company controlling Neverland ""is considering"" putting the estate up for sale .

"(CNN) -- Jason Priestley played Brandon Walsh on ""Beverly Hills 90210"" from 1990 to 1998. Having long since hung up his Peach Pit uniform and Beverly Hills Beach Club cabana boy polo shirt, his character became a journalist and departed to take a job at the Washington Bureau of the New York Chronicle, and Priestley left the show four episodes into the series' ninth season. ""I felt that the character of Brandon had kind of run his course. I had explored everything I wanted to explore with him,"" Priestley told CNN while promoting his new book, ""Jason Priestley: A Memoir"" (HarperOne) at the New York Bureau of CNN. ""In retrospect, I do regret leaving. Understanding what I do now about story and character, I believe that [Aaron Spelling] was pushing the story in a direction that would have had Brandon and Kelly end up together at the end of the show and I think I probably should have stuck around to its fruition."" Fans of ""90210"" surely remember Kelly Taylor's (Jennie Garth) ""I choose me"" speech following Brandon and Dylan McKay's (Luke Perry) showdown for her affections. Brandon wanted Kelly to marry him. Dylan wanted to take her on a trip around the world. But Priestley believes Executive Producer Aaron Spelling had always envisioned Brandon and Kelly riding off into the sunset. ""I think my departure also hurt Aaron's feelings,"" continued Priestley. ""Aaron and I had worked very closely together for a number of years. He gave me a lot of opportunities, and I feel like my departure hurt his feelings and I never meant to do that."" Among the opportunities Spelling afforded the Vancouver-born Priestley was the opportunity to direct several ""90210"" episodes -- 15 in total. In fact, Priestley directed two of the series' most iconic: The one where Dylan's wife, Toni Marchette (Rebecca Gayheart) was killed in a mob hit mix-up in which Dylan was the target; and the episode where Donna Martin (Tori Spelling) lost her virginity. ""Everyone remembers the candles,"" Priestly, 44, said of the episode in which Donna had sex for the first time. ""But I could only have, like, six candles because they didn't want to pay for a fire marshal, which would have cost $350."" Yep. $350. So six candles it was. ""So I had that one candelabra,"" recalled Priestley, ""and I kept moving it around for every shot and through the magic of Hollywood it looked like a lot of candles!"" As the director, as well as Spelling's friend, Priestley was under the added stress of directing a scene in which the TV legend's daughter loses her virginity -- albeit her alter ego. ""I was in a difficult spot,"" he said. ""I wanted to be respectful, but it had to be sexy. I was kind of walking on eggshells that day."" Priestley also contributed to the dialogue of the show. True ""90210"" devotees should recall that Brandon had quite a few catchphrases, and Priestley was kind enough to reflect on such Brandon Walsh-isms as: . ""Stop the bombing!"" ""Seldom right and wrong again."" ""Right church, wrong pew."" ""Dim sum and den some."" ""It's funny that you bring all those sayings up,"" said Priestley. ""Part of the fun of working on 'Beverly Hills, 90210,' for me, was that I got a lot of freedom from our executive producer, Chuck Rosen, to add things, change things. I got a lot of freedom to be creative. My theater training was all improv, that's sort of the world I came from, so the Brandon Walsh-isms you speak of, a lot of them came from me! I've been saying, 'Stop the bombing!' for a long time."" Another reason Priestley regrets leaving ""90210"" is because the series needed Brandon's Eagle Scout ways to offset the onscreen chaos. ""I think there was no more moral center to the show,"" Priestley said of Brandon's departure. ""There was no more lynchpin. There were no more Walshes in the Walsh House. It kind of didn't make sense anymore. So, I regret leaving the show for all those reasons."" Though it premiered nearly a quarter-century ago, ""90210"" continues to resonate with audiences. ""It's certainly not the fashions,"" said Priestley. ""I think there were a lot of universal life lessons and truths in that show, and I think that's maybe why it's stood the test of time."" The book goes into all manner of ""90210"" tell-all, such as Shannen Doherty's shenanigans and what led to her firing. Brenda's bon voyage had nothing do do with Doherty's hard-partying ways and nightclub fights. Spelling actually thought that any publicity was good publicity. Rather, it was her chronic tardiness that held up production, costing Fox a ton of money. Spelling gave Doherty many chances, but in the end, it was a business decision. Priestley also writes about who he keeps in touch with (pretty much everybody, but he and Luke Perry are particularly close), his five-year romance with actress Christine Elise (who played the unstable but later redeemed, esteemed Cousteau Institute scholar Emily Valentine), and his not so warm and fuzzy feelings about Tori Spelling's husband, fellow Canadian Dean McDermott. Priestley is at peace with being forever associated with Brandon Walsh. ""I'm OK with it,"" he told CNN. ""It's baggage I carry with me. But I find as my career goes on, and I have more and more successes in other arenas and with other characters, I find that Brandon becomes less and less part of my life. I find that a lot of people associate me with 'Call Me Fitz' these days."" ""Call Me Fitz"" is an award-winning HBO Canada half-hour comedy -- available to Americans on DirecTV -- in which Priestley plays an immoral, Sinatra-idolizing used car salesman. ""Jason Priestley: A Memoir"" also recalls the prefame days of having Brad Pitt for a roommate, Priestley's later battles with alcohol (he once spent five days in jail on a DUI), and the 2002 race car crash that nearly cost him his life. Additionally on the professional horizon, Priestley's feature directorial debut, ""Cas & Dylan,"" a road trip comedy starring Richard Dreyfuss, will hit theaters later this year. Priestley is married to makeup artist Naomi Lowde. The couple has a young daughter and a young son. ""My kids are my greatest achievement,"" Priestley told CNN. ""I love being a husband and a father. That aspect of my life has been a joy.""","Jason Priestley told CNN he let Aaron Spelling down when he left ""Beverly Hills, 90210""

"(CNN) -- A massive iceberg that broke off an Antarctic glacier in July is now moving toward the open ocean and could pose a threat to busy shipping lanes, researchers reported. The huge berg is estimated to be about 270 square miles (700 square kilometers) in area, about the size of nation of Singapore or double the size of the city of Atlanta. ""An iceberg that size could survive for a year or longer and it could drift a long way north in that time and end up in the vicinity of world shipping lanes in the Southern Ocean,"" Robert Marsh, a scientist at the University of Southampton in England, said in a press release this week. Detecting the dangers of Greenland's giant icebergs . Marsh is part of a team of scientists who have been given an emergency grant to track the iceberg and predict its path so ships traveling through the area can be alerted. Researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute, using images from the German Space Agency's TerraSAR-X satellite, reported in July that the iceberg was separating from the Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier. It had been kept close to the glacier by sea ice, another researcher, Grant Bigg from the University of Sheffield, told the BBC. But the end of the Antarctic winter has melted some of the sea ice and given the berg a route to the open ocean, he said. ""In the last couple of days, it has begun to break away and now a kilometer or two of clear water has developed between it and the glacier,"" Bigg told the BBC. The calving of the massive berg has been a long process. The crack that produced it was first detected by a NASA plane in October 2011. The researchers say this will be the first time to track the path of such a massive iceberg, something that will be more important as the effects of global warming increase.

"(CNN) -- With no way to counter toxic jellyfish that brought intense pain and partial paralysis during an attempted 103-mile ocean crossing from Cuba to Florida, endurance swimmer Diana Nyad said Monday that she will not make another attempt at the feat. ""I can't beat those guys. They're too much for me,"" Nyad said. Nyad, 62, swam 82 nautical miles of the 103-mile crossing before two stings from what her team identified as potentially lethal box jellyfish forced her out of the water Sunday morning. In a frequently emotional news conference in which she removed her shirt to reveal sting marks, Nyad said she initially planned to muscle through the intense pain. But she said she eventually had to give up as the toxins began to cause partial paralysis and made it increasingly difficult for her to breathe. What's a Portuguese man-of-war? Nyad still had a wheeze Monday, said one of her doctors, Clifton Page of the University of Miami. Toxins from the stings also affected members of her crew trying to help her. ""This was a life-threatening situation we were in,"" Page said. Nyad stopped the swim Sunday morning after 40 hours in the water. ""It's not easy for me to let go of this dream, and I'm in distress about it,"" she said. She said it was ""naive"" of her not to anticipate problems from the jellyfish, which she said are proliferating throughout the world's oceans because of climate change. Unlike sharks, which her team countered with divers and electronic devices, no good tools exist to fend off jellyfish, Nyad said. She said she knows she could complete the crossing were it not for the creatures. She said the last two years of training were not wasted. ""It's been a grand, elevating, life-confirming experience these last two years,"" she said. Nyad began her attempt Friday evening from Havana's Hemingway Marina, expecting to spend about 60 hours in the water. It was her third attempt to complete the swim. Her first, in 1978, was brought to an end by strong currents and bad weather after almost 42 hours in the water. She made a second try in August, but she was pulled from the water after 60 miles and almost 29 hours of swimming. She blamed a shoulder injury she suffered early in the journey and an 11-hour-long asthma attack. She said people inspired by her efforts should continue to train their bodies, test their wills and dream big. And, said said, not being able finish the crossing against such odds was no sign of failure, for her or her team. ""There's so much boldness in living life this way, and we did it all, and no one can take it away from us,"" she said.","Swimmer Diana Nyad says she will not attempt Cuba-to-Florida crossing again .

"Washington (CNN) -- If nothing else, the latest ISIS act of barbarism brought a quick political consensus, and added pressure on President Barack Obama: Caution in the face of repugnant horror just won't do. The president responded Wednesday in his first public remarks since the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff. He promised results while pleading for time to deal with Islamic terrorists in Iraq and Syria. ""Our objective is clear: That is to degrade and destroy ISIL so it's no longer a threat,"" Obama said during a news conference in his trip to Estonia. ""It's going to take some time, it's going to take some effort,"" he said. His comments came the day after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle called for action. ""We must use every tool at our disposal, short of introducing ground forces in combat roles, to put an end to the threat they pose to our national security,"" Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said in a statement Tuesday. Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, rarely on the same page as Shaheen, also called on Obama to respond, and quickly. ""There is no disease that becomes easier to treat the longer you wait,"" Rubio said. But whether increased bipartisan pressure will translate into a dramatically new and bolder administration approach is an open question. ""He is not going to plunge America into another trillion-dollar social science project because two American journalists have been killed, no matter how horrific it is,"" said longtime State Department hand Aaron David Miller, now a scholar at the Wilson Center. ISIS video shows beheading of American journalist . Still, given the second barbaric beheading in a few weeks and the growing political calls for more decisive action, Miller said, ""You can't imagine him not responding in some way."" The rush of statements from politicians shared similar language calling for action and a better explanation of U.S. policy. 'Let there be no doubt, we must go after ISIS right away,"" said Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, the senior senator from the home state of American journalist Steven Sotloff. ""It is long overdue for the Obama administration to present to the Congress, the American people, and our allies around the world a comprehensive strategy to respond to the horrific threat ISIS poses,"" moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins said in a statement. What can the U.S. do against ISIS in Syria? And Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, already among the Republicans suggesting Obama has been too timid in responding to the ISIS threat, said it was time to stop debating whether to use U.S. air power against ISIS leadership targets in Syria. ""Condemnation is not enough to deal with this scourge. It is time we act decisively,"" Graham said. The GOP hawk said airpower had proven to be effective against ISIS targets on a limited basis in Iraq and said now: ""It's a tactic that should be aggressively pursued both in Syria and Iraq. Mr. President, if you can't come up with a strategy, at least tell us what the goal is."" The timing also adds to the pressure on the President. ISIS released the video showing the purported murder of Sotloff as Obama traveled to Europe to attend a NATO summit, where responding to ISIS is a top agenda item. Miller sees sad irony in the fact that a president who made a name for himself in politics with innovative uses of social media to communicate ""is now forced to respond because of this cruel and savage use of it."" Obama 'cautious' approach on ISIS is panned . As the commander in chief traveled, a top State Department official urged patience even in the wake of the apparent Sotloff beheading. ""Obviously, ISIS is a very sophisticated organization,"" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Brett McGurk told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""You cannot just go in militarily and start dropping bombs, and hope that it's going to work out. You have to have a very sophisticated approach to this."" In the short term, veteran diplomats and intelligence experts acknowledge the pressure on the White House to respond with force will be intense, but they cautioned the menu of options might not be terribly appealing. ""I'm not sure there is a one-off airstrike or small set of airstrikes that would achieve much right now,"" Miller said. ""And I don't think they are ready, in terms of identifying the targets, for a sustained and comprehensive set of strikes in Syria right now."" Why a strategy to fight ISIS in Syria will take time . Given that the options are hardly appealing, Miller said the President's often-criticized caution makes considerable policy sense. ""But his risk aversion is politically a disaster for him."" While mulling new military and diplomatic moves, Miller and others suggested a growing urgency for the president to set a speech or some other event to explain in detail the ISIS threat and his deliberations. ""It took 10 years to take down al Qaeda,"" Miller said. ""Given some of the advantages ISIS has it will probably take 20. He will be handing off to the next guy or woman who is going to have to continue the fight. But he has got to figure a way to lay out a strategy, and explain the generational aspect. That is something a president needs to do."" Apparent ISIS executioner: 'I'm back, Obama'","The second video of an American beheaded by ISIS prompted fast calls for more action .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabian officials beheaded and then publicly displayed the body of a convicted killer in Riyadh on Friday, an act that prompted a stiff denunciation by a leading human rights monitor. The Saudi Interior Ministry said Ahmed Al-Shamlani Al-Anzi was sentenced to death and then ""crucifixion"" -- having his body displayed in public -- for the kidnapping and killing of an 11-year-old boy and for the killing of the boy's father, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. Amnesty International issued a statement deploring the punishment, with the group's Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui saying in a statement it is ""horrific"" that beheadings and crucifixions ""still happen."" Even though the word ""crucifixion"" is used to describe the public display, the act has no connection to Christianity and the crucifixion of Jesus. The bodies are not displayed on crosses, Lamri Chirouf, who researches Saudi Arabian issues for Amnesty, explained. The Saudi Interior Ministry asserted that Al-Anzi's body was displayed as a warning that those involved in similar crimes would suffer the same fate, the press agency reported. The ministry said Al-Anzi kidnapped the boy and held him for a ""malicious purpose"" at a grocery store where he worked. He tied rope around the boy's neck and strangled him to death, the ministry said. When the boy's father came to the store looking for his son, Al-Anzi axed the father repeatedly until the man died. When police came to arrest Al-Anzi, Al-Anzi resisted arrest by threatening them with a knife. Police later discovered that Al-Anzi had been previously convicted of other crimes, including possession of pornographic videos and sodomy, the Interior Ministry said. Chirouf, the Saudi Arabian researcher for Amnesty International, said his understanding of how the Saudi government carries out crucifixion jibed with Saudi Press Agency's account. Government officials do use crucifixions, or public displays of executed bodies, as a tool to deter people from committing such a crime, he said. This latest case was classified as an offense of rebellion, one that basically rejected all of the rules of religion and society, he said. Chirouf said those crucified are beheaded first and then their heads are sewn back on their bodies. Then, the corpse is mounted on a pole or a tree. The English-language Saudi Gazette newspaper said the body was placed on public display throughout the evening and Chirouf said it was his understanding that the body was to be displayed for a few hours. In its denunciation of the punishment, Amnesty International deplored the ""extensive use of the death penalty"" in Saudi Arabia. ""King Abdullah should show true leadership and commute all death sentences if Saudi Arabia is to have any role to play as a global leader or member of the G-20,"" Sahraoui said. The group asserts that ""trial proceedings"" in the country ""fall far below international fair-trial standards."" ""They usually take place behind closed doors without adequate legal representation. Convictions are often made on the basis of ""confessions"" obtained under duress, including torture or other ill-treatment during incommunicado detention,"" Amnesty International said. ""Those who are sentenced to death are often not informed of the progress of legal proceedings against them or of the date of execution until the morning when they are taken out and beheaded."" Amnesty International said there were 102 executions in Saudi Arabia in 2008 and is aware of 136 people believed to be awaiting execution. It says there has been ""a high number of executions of migrant workers and other foreign nationals, in particular from Asia and Africa."" Al-Anzi was a Saudi national, said Chirouf -- who added ""nobody knows how many people are on death row"" in Saudi Arabia.","Man executed for kidnapping, killing boy and killing of the boy's father .

"(CNN) -- Football's world governing body FIFA has provisionally suspended outgoing Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer for 90 days ""based on the fact that various breaches of the Code of Ethics appear to have been committed"" by the American. The former general secretary of CONCACAF, the body which governs football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, has been barred from taking part in ""any kind of football-related activity"" for a maximum period of 90 days. The decision was taken by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- which opened investigation proceedings against Blazer, 68, in response to a report filed by the CONCACAF Integrity Committee last month. ""The decision was taken following a request made by the acting deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the Ethics Committee, Robert Torres, based on the fact that various breaches of the FIFA Code of Ethics appear to have been committed by Chuck Blazer and that a decision on the main issue could not be taken early enough,"" read a Fifa statement. The announcement comes less than one week after fellow FIFA executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando of Sri Lanka was banned for eight years for unethical behaviour. The CONCACAF report alleged that Blazer, who has been provisionally banned pending a full disciplinary hearing, received at least $15 million in addition to other funds that were used to buy and rent luxury apartments. Blazer, who has been the most senior American official at FIFA for the last 16 years, had previously said that he will give up his seat on the Executive Committee when his term expires at the end of this month. He resigned as CONCACAF's general secretary in 2011, after serving with the body for 21 years. In April, the head of CONCACAF's integrity committee, David Simmons, described Blazer and his former boss, Trinidadian Jack Warner, as being 'fraudulent in their management' of the continental organization. The former colleagues fell out in 2011 when Blazer reported Warner and Asian Football Confederation chief Mohamed bin Hammam to FIFA's Ethics Committee, accusing the duo of trying to bribe Caribbean delegated to support the Qatari bin Hammam in that year's FIFA presidential election. Blazer's accusations led to the downfall of bin Hammam, the resignation of Warner as a FIFA vice president and CONCACAF leader, and sanctions against several Caribbean football officials. Now however, Blazer finds himself in the dock alongside Warner. Last month, Simmons accused both men of abusing their ""position and power"" -- with Warner said to have failed to disclose the creation of a $25.9 million CONCACAF center of excellence on his land, while Blazer was accused of mismanaging funds. Both men have denied any wrongdoing. FIFA has been affected by numerous corruption scandals in recent times, which do not only involve the likes of Warner, Blazer and Manilal. Last week, former president Joao Havelange - who ruled the organization between 1974 and 1988 - resigned as FIFA's honorary president after the 96-year-old was ruled to have taken bribes in a report by ethics chairman Eckert.","FIFA provisionally ban Executive Committee member Chuck Blazer for maximum of 90 days .

"Kamaishi, Japan (CNN) -- Ikuo Fujiwara stops in front of the wreckage of the Buddhist temple, brings his hands together and prays. The monk bursts into tears, an involuntary act, as he asks heaven what he can do to comfort his destroyed hometown and begin to rebuild his house of worship. Fujiwara needs heaven to speak to him, for he must preside over Kamaishi's first mass burials in memory. Behind his temple, the sound of heavy machinery digging giant ditches for unmarked coffins echoes through the shattered remains of the 300-year-old building. ""We don't have enough places to cremate the bodies,"" says Fujiwara. ""So temporarily, we're burying the bodies here."" The ditches sit within 50 meters of the Buddhist burial plots, where cremated remains lie underneath grey headstones. This is a sacred practice that every Japanese person expects at death, explains Fujiwara. A Japanese funeral is elaborate, formal, and ritualized in the Buddhist faith. So the wide ditches and the coffins, which will eventually lie in them side by side, are an unbearable insult in the minds of ordinary Japanese citizens. But ordinary expectations have been abandoned in Japan's tsunami zone, where entire towns were decimated by a wall of water that struck in the wake of a magnitude-9.0 earthquake March 11. ""I feel very sad about this,"" says Fujiwara, adding that the mass graves are only one component of the overwhelming pain felt throughout Kamaishi. ""My friends and my temple members, I don't know yet how many of them I lost. And the town is destroyed. I'm concerned if we can rebuild."" Fujiwara doesn't look like the monk of this temple, wearing a fisherman's boots and winter coat. The tsunami destroyed all of his robes. Like many of the tsunami victims mourning the dead, he can't dress in proper funeral attire. Fujiwara says he will still try to administer the most respectful service he can offer to the survivors who will line the ditches. But he knows in the minds of many of those families, it will never replace a proper Japanese Buddhist ceremony. However, city health leaders say they have no choice but to bury the dead in mass graves. Thousands of bodies pulled from the rubble have been stored in school gymnasiums-turned-morgues. About 17,000 people remain missing, so officials believe more bodies will be recovered. Even if they can be identified, the crematoriums on Japan's northern coastline are either damaged from the tsunami or already full. A shortage of gas has meant bodies can't be taken to other parts of the country for cremation. Stressing the burials will be temporary, cities have begun the process of placing bodies in mass graves to prevent disease outbreak. Tadaharu Kinoshita, searching through Kamaishi's morgues for his brother, says it hurts his heart to think of his kin lying in a mass grave. But there is a greater indignity, he says. ""My one hope is to find his body,"" says Kinoshita. ""If he remains missing, we'll never really know. Even if he's in a mass grave, at least then, we'll know.""","Buddhist funerals typically are highly ritualized .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. House passed a bill Thursday that would amend the health care law to bar federal funding for health plans that provide abortion services. The vote was 251 in favor and 170 against. The bill, the Protect Life Act, was sponsored by Pennsylvania Republican Joe Pitts and gathered overwhelming Republican support. Only two Republicans voted against it, along with all but 15 Democrats. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi condemned the bill during earlier debate, arguing that if it passed, ""women can die on the floor and health care providers do not have to intervene."" Democrats opposed to the bill charged that the GOP majority was ignoring the nation's top priority and instead spending time on a bitterly divisive issue. ""Instead of focusing on jobs, Republicans are continuing to wage their war on women,"" California Democrat Barbara Lee said on the House floor. But GOP leaders emphasized the House spent the bulk of the week on proposals like the three free trade agreements that passed Wednesday aimed at boosting job creation. They explained Thursday's vote was simply following through on a campaign promise that House Republicans made when they outlined their agenda in the run-up to the 2010 elections. ""We've done four or five solid job-creation bills this week and this bill was part of our Pledge to America. We are keeping our word to the American people, and we are going to do it,"" House Speaker John Boehner said. Supporters of the measure argued that the health care law contains a loophole that allows those receiving federal subsidies to use the money to enroll in health care plans that allow abortion services. Abortion rights advocates maintain the bill is unnecessary because existing laws already bar any taxpayer money from underwriting abortion procedures. During the health care debate, President Barack Obama signed an executive order stating no federal funds could be used in the new health care exchanges created in the law. Pro-abortion-rights groups like Planned Parenthood also maintain the bill adds a new restriction. Currently, hospitals that receive federal funds but don't have facilities to treat women who may need emergency abortion services are directed to transfer those patients to a health care facility that can treat them. The Pitts bill removes that requirement. A day after the House passed the three trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea with sizable bipartisan votes, debate in the House chamber on the abortion bill Thursday was heated and at times became personal. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-California, who revealed last year that she suffered a miscarriage and required a procedure to end her pregnancy, accused Republicans of being ""absolutely misogynist"" for bringing up the bill. But Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, responded, ""The misogyny comes from those who promote the killing of unborn babies."" Foxx said the bill was not about taking away any existing rights, but restricting the use of federal money. She cited opinion polls showing that more than three-quarters of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortions. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, disputed Democrats who repeatedly argued that Obama's 2010 executive order made it clear women would have to use private funds to pay for any abortion services. ""It is flawed because executive orders can disappear as quickly as they are issued. But the Protect Life Act will create a solid framework that will safeguard taxpayer dollars,"" Ros-Lehtinen said. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill and the White House issued a veto threat on the Protect Life Act on Wednesday.","Bill passes with overwhelming Republican support .

"(CNN) -- Whenever anything involves the ""Star Wars"" franchise, there are certain expectations that need to be met to satisfy die-hard, and even casual, fans. So when a new video game wants to bring ""Star Wars"" to life like never before, that's setting the bar really high. ""Kinect Star Wars"" tries to use the power of the Kinect controller for the Xbox 360 to put players into the action, using full-body motions to wield lightsabers, drive podracers and, unfortunately, dance for Jabba the Hutt. The game has a few high points but also has more disappointments than a bad motivator on a defective R2 unit. There are five sections to the game, offering different styles of gameplay and a complete campaign in each. One section, Duels of Fate, is locked at the very beginning, but quickly unlocks after players complete the first mission in the Jedi Destiny section. Jedi Destiny is where players learn how to use their body movements to control the Force and use their lightsaber. Players start out as training Padawans (those who are just learning how to use the Force) and are quickly thrust into a conflict with the Sith. When the Kinect controller works, the actions are seamless and fluid. The animations look somewhat similar to what you'd see in a ""Star Wars: Clone Wars"" cartoon, which means they are easy on the eyes and familiar. Force actions are fun to use. Grabbing a battle droid with the Force and flinging it into a group of its mates is quite enjoyable. However, when the Kinect controller failed to read my actions properly, no amount of flailing in front of my screen would alleviate my frustration. More often than not, I couldn't control the action as well as I would have liked, and I ended up many times just wading into groups of enemies and waving my lightsaber around. There are times during Jedi Destiny when you control a speeder, gun turret or X-wing fighter for battles, but the controls seem sluggish and make it difficult to accurately pinpoint shots. Rancor Rampage was probably the most fun out of all the segments. Players act as a freed rancor (Remember him? The monster in the pit at Jabba's lair?) and get to smash people, droids and buildings with abandon. Here is where flailing about actually works to your advantage. The rancor smashes the ground to level opponents, charges through buildings with abandon and, yes, eats people to gain health. The controls felt responsive to the appropriate moves, providing the best one-to-one movement experience out of all the game segments. The podracing section is pretty straightforward. Players act as the driver and use their motion to control speed, direction and ramming abilities. The storyline occurs years after Anakin Skywalker won his race in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace,"" but many of the characters are still around and add some great dialogue in between races. The feel of being in a podracer is well animated and would be fun, except that holding your arms out continually to control your racer gets tiring and painful. The races are rather long, and you'll need to take breaks often just to rest your shoulders. Galactic Dance Off is the least ""Star Wars""-like segment of the entire game. It is pretty much any Kinect dancing game, given a ""Star Wars"" coating. Modern dance songs are slightly tweaked to include ""Star Wars"" characters or plot points. Some of the dance moves are named after Force moves, and even iconic characters are dragged onto the dance floor. From a straight gameplay perspective, the dancing works and will be enjoyable to those who like those games. For someone hoping to have a ""Star Wars"" experience, the Dance Off is best avoided. It seemed to be more game padding than substance. Duels of Fate puts you in one-on-one lightsaber battles with different foes from ""Star Wars"" lore, advancing your way through the ranks to face off against the dark lord himself, Darth Vader. If any part of the game was going to appeal to fans, it was going to be this one. However, this segment is plagued by the same problems found in Jedi Destiny. The motions appear off at times, it is hard to string together actions for a successful hit, and the feel of the action is less than enjoyable. Overall, ""Kinect Star Wars"" has so much going on that it's is likely to have something that appeals to almost any style of gamer. It is just unfortunate that the two areas where the gameplay actually works best are the two segments that do the worst job representing the ""Star Wars"" canon. Maybe we expect too much from a ""Star Wars"" title when we want it to reflect exactly what we've seen in the movies and television. Maybe our imagination's desire to put ourselves in the place of Luke Skywalker or Darth Maul can't successfully be translated into a video game. The right ideas are here for what could have been a fulfilling experience. However, the Kinect controller, for all the good that it does in other titles, lets the player down and doesn't see through with the promise of a new hope for the gamer/fan experience. ""Kinect Star Wars"" is available now exclusively for the Xbox 360 and can be played only using the Kinect controller. It is rated ""T for Teens"" because of mild language, mild suggestive themes and violence.

"(CNN) -- A team of 30 searchers will soon begin digging in an area in Portugal near where Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007, a source close to the investigation told CNN on Tuesday. British police are leading the hunt for Madeleine, who was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in the country. On Monday, media gathered outside a cordoned-off section of the beach resort town of Praia da Luz, in Portugal's Algarve region. A blue tent will cover the search area, and dogs will aid the search, the source told CNN. The land is extremely dry and covered in stones. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, left the girl and her younger twin siblings asleep in the apartment on May 3, 2007, while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Her mother checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing. CNN understands that London's Metropolitan Police will be in charge of the new digging operation in abandoned terrain close to where Madeleine disappeared. A large investigation team is expected to also use radar in the search. Portuguese police searched the area soon after Madeleine's disappearance, and it is understood they will intervene only if remains are found. Sources told CNN that British police were working on the assumption that Madeleine was dead, while their Portuguese counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of Portugal by a non-Portuguese national who had been in the country for a short time. Scotland Yard -- as London's Metropolitan Police are known -- has not commented on the latest development, other than to confirm that British officers would be in Praia da Luz this week. On May 22, its head of specialist crime and operations, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, told media there would be ""specific police activity"" in Portugal in the coming weeks, relating to Madeleine's disappearance. ""It should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in Portugal will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened,"" he warned. ""What you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation."" Rowley said the senior investigator in the case, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, and his team would be traveling to Portugal but would not be commenting on the investigation. He reiterated that Portuguese police had advised Metropolitan Police that they did not brief media on current investigations. ""They clearly stated that if the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) provide any briefings or information on the work they are undertaking on our behalf, or if reporters cause any disruption to their work in Portugal, activity will cease until that problem dissipates,"" Rowley said. ""We have made it clear to colleagues in Portugal that we will not be giving operational updates,"" he said. ""If media interfere with police work, that work will stop."" In July 2013, Scotland Yard reopened its investigation into Madeleine's disappearance after a two-year review of the original probe. Portuguese police reopened their investigation last October. At the time, the Metropolitan Police said the two police forces' investigations would run in parallel. Madeleine's parents launched a massive publicity campaign to find their daughter after she went missing and say they continue to believe she is still alive.","Thirty searchers to be involved, source says .

"(CNN) -- The two boys abducted by their parents and taken to Cuba were ""well cared for"" on their trip, their grandmother told reporters. The children, Chase and Cole, don't know they were abducted, Patricia Hauser said. All they know is they were on an ""adventure,"" she said Thursday. The boys -- 2 and 4 -- appeared in front of reporters after Hauser spoke, smiling and showing off toys. ""We have not asked the boys anything about the journey. We are just letting them tell us as things come out if they feel like talking,"" said Hauser, who along with her husband was given legal custody of the children April 2. Police say their father, Josh Hakken, broke into the home where the boys were living with their grandparents a day later, tying up their grandmother before whisking the two children away. Authorities say they traveled to Cuba on a sailboat. Authorities reunited the boys with Hauser and her husband on Wednesday after Cuban authorities turned the parents and the children over to U.S. officials. Boys reunite with grandparents . Hauser thanked U.S. State Department and Cuban officials for their work to find the children and bring them back to Florida. ""They called us from Cuba and let us talk to the boys before their plane even left,"" she said. ""Many tears were shed in that room from us."" She said the family would not have any more news conferences or interviews, and asked that the media and public respect their privacy. ""We are trying very hard to shield the boys from media coverage, and we want them to get back to their normal everyday schedules and just be normal carefree boys again,"" she said. According to search warrant documents released Thursday by Florida authorities, Hauser told investigators that Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, had ""previously discussed suicide."" The documents, citing the boys' grandmother, also allege the boys' father tied her to a filing cabinet with plastic cable ties before abducting the children ""with force."" Thursday night, an attorney for the Hakkens agreed to the prosecution's request that the Hakkens remain jailed without bond until trial. The next hearing is May 30. The judge also appointed a public defender to represent the couple after they said they wouldn't be able to pay for a lawyer on their own. Later, the state attorney's office filed formal charges against the Hakkens, including two counts of felony kidnapping. Given Florida sentencing guidelines, a conviction on the kidnapping charges could mean the Hakkens will spend the rest of their lives behind bars. Among the 11 counts, the couple was also charged with burglary, false imprisonment and child abuse. Police: Parents talked of 'journey to the Armageddon' The circumstances leading up to the ordeal began in June when the family was staying at a hotel in Slidell, Louisiana. Responding to a call, police officers found the parents ""acting in a bizarre manner,"" Slidell police said in a statement. Inside the room where the boys were, authorities found narcotics and weapons. ""They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon,'"" police said about the parents. Louisiana authorities took the children from their parents after that incident. About two weeks later, the father showed up at a foster family home with a gun and demanded the return of the boys, Slidell police said. He fled after the foster parents called 911. Over subsequent months, the parents ""did not participate in the system,"" said Sheriff David Gee of Hillsborough County. He did not offer details. ""As a result of that, the authorities in Louisiana gave custody to the grandparents,"" he said. That transfer became official on April 2, when a Louisiana judge terminated the suspects' parental rights. Early the next morning, Patricia Hauser told police, Josh Hakken entered her Florida home, tied her up and sped away with the children and the family dog in a silver 2009 Toyota Camry. They met up with Sharyn Hakken, sheriff's investigators said, and eventually ended up on a 25-foot sailboat named Salty. The boat's seller later tipped off authorities after word got out about the alleged abduction. It was at the Hemingway Marina just west of Havana, on Tuesday, that CNN found the family -- hunkered inside the boat, under the watch of Cuban security forces. That morning, U.S. officials in Havana told CNN that they were afraid the children could be in danger from their parents. Armed Cuban security agents watched over the family most of the day until the parents and children were led away peacefully that afternoon. Boys 'fine, happy and sleepy' on return to U.S. Cuba and the United States are divided by far more than the Straits of Florida. But this week, U.S. officials repeatedly expressed their appreciation for the Cuban government's ""extensive cooperation."" The Cuban Foreign Ministry said the boat pulled into the marina in bad weather Sunday. The two governments shared information, which led to the return of the family and their dog to the United States.

VBS.TV is the broadband television network of VICE. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- We had heard about a drug in Colombia that essentially eliminates free-will in humans. It is called scopolamine and it seemed to us to be so completely out there--like a plot device in an awful Jack Black movie. In fact, it sounded so horrible and strange that we wanted to go down and try it out. So the producers and I compiled a laundry list of embarrassing chores for me to complete while under the influence and, chuckling hysterically to ourselves, got on a plane and headed for Bogota, Colombia. Once we landed in the Colombian capital, it took all of about 60 minutes to realize there wasn't going to be any more laughing. The fear that the mere mention of scopolamine struck in the locals was palpable and startling. As we dug deeper into this drug's story, following the evolution of the plant and its uses, we began to appreciate the gravity of ingesting it. And we became fearful. We heard harrowing tales from victims and perpetrators alike, sat with prostitutes who calmly explained administering the drug to unsuspecting johns, and visited the home of a man who confessed in chilling detail to murdering someone who had dosed him with the drug. It was difficult to believe at times, but we spoke to countless law enforcement officials and medical professionals who verified all that we'd heard, and who also expressed their frustration and fear with what they saw as a growing problem. See the rest of Colombian devil's breath at VBS.TV . After a week of chasing this story across the city, we were rattled. By the time we met up with our local contact, a dealer named Demencia, I had little to no interest in going through with the plan as conceived. Still, he bought a gram of the drug, and when he returned to the car and began to open it, all the horror stories of the week came rushing at me. It occurred to me we were sitting in a car full of expensive video equipment on the outskirts of Bogota with a known drug dealer we had just met, and in his possession was arguably the most dangerous drug in the world. Fortunately for us, Demencia turned out to be a rather trustworthy drug dealer, and we made it out of Bogota unscathed, our mental faculties intact, the scopolamine dispatched safely into a nearby toilet. We have not, however, been able to shake the stories we heard.","Journalist heads to Colombia to learn about drug, originally intending to try it .

"Camp Verde, Arizona (CNN) -- Several participants in a 2009 ""sweat lodge"" ritual that left three people dead were collapsing and ""having issues"" in the superheated environment, a survivor testified Thursday in an Arizona self-help guru's manslaughter trial. ""I mentioned several times that I thought people were having issues and needed help to leave, and they didn't wish to leave,"" Melissa Phillips testified. She said she could hear ""a snorting breath sound"" from one of the participants, Kirby Brown, who died after the October 2009 event. Phillips said during the event, one of her friends had collapsed ""and couldn't feel her legs, and her husband was really concerned. So I asked the angels to help me and I did the breathwork affirmations that I was taught."" Phillips was the first witness in the trial of James Arthur Ray, who faces reckless manslaughter charges stemming from his ""Spiritual Warrior"" retreat outside Sedona, Arizona. The sweat lodge hosted a purification ritual for participants modeled on Native American customs. Prosecutors argued that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches, and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature, causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heatstroke. Brown, 38, of Westtown, New York, and James Shore, 40, of Milwaukee, died the night of the October 2009 event, while Lizbeth Marie Neuman, 49, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, died nine days later. At least 15 others who took part fell ill, but more than 40 others were uninjured. Ray, 53, had conducted his Spiritual Warrior Retreat for six years at a cost of about $10,000 to participants. The sweat lodge, 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide, was built to accommodate up to 75 people. There was a pit in the center where heated rocks were placed, and Ray poured water over the stones to create steam. Defense attorney Luis Li told jurors as the trial began Tuesday that the deaths were ""a tragic accident -- not a crime."" But prosecutors maintain Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to their deaths. Under cross-examination, Phillips acknowledged signing a release form that warned of an ""inherent risk"" of injury in some activities in Ray's program. But she said she wouldn't have taken part ""if I had thought my life could be in jeopardy."" She also said she had left the lodge at one point, but went back in. When she finally left, ""I couldn't walk immediately. and I was shaking and I was overheated and not feeling well,"" Phillips said. Paramedics had been called by that time, and when one told her she may have suffered carbon monoxide poisoning, ""I freaked out."" ""I decided I had medical insurance and would go to the hospital and get checked out,"" she said.

"London, England (CNN) -- British singer Morrissey was hospitalized overnight after reportedly collapsing on stage during a concert, medical officials said Sunday. Morrissey was discharged about 1 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) on Sunday, ""much improved,"" said Great Western Hospital manager Teresa Harding. ""He was admitted ... as a precautionary measure,"" she said, refusing to reveal anything further about his condition or the reason he was hospitalized. The 50-year-old recording artist, who seldom uses his full name Steven Patrick Morrissey, was scheduled to perform in Swindon, west of London, on Saturday night. According to fan accounts on various Web sites, the singer collapsed after the first song. ""Morrissey is in stable condition after his collapse in Swindon Saturday night,"" said a statement on his Web site. ""Thanks go out to all his well wishers, more information will be posted as soon as it is available."" An ambulance was called to the concert venue just after 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), a spokeswoman for Great Western Ambulance told CNN. ""He was treated on the scene and then taken to hospital,"" she said, declining to say anything about the singer's medical complaint. She said the ambulance service takes 60 to 70 percent of its patients to hospitals, rather than treat them at the scene. She asked to be identified only as a spokeswoman for the ambulance service, in line with British custom. Morrissey was the frontman of the seminal 1980s band The Smiths, before embarking on a successful solo career. In a 2002 piece, British music magazine NME named The Smiths ""the most influential artist ever"" -- ahead of the Beatles. The singer has canceled or rescheduled more than a dozen planned concerts this year, according to his Web site.","Morrissey taken to hospital after collapsing on stage during concert .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- The British journalist expelled from Russia was denied entry when he came back to the country because ""he violated a number of rules concerning the work of foreign correspondents,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said on its website Tuesday. Luke Harding, the Moscow reporter for the Guardian newspaper, was detained by Russian authorities, locked in a cell for 45 minutes, and then put on a plane back to London, according to an article in the Guardian Tuesday.  He had been returning to Moscow after spending two months in London reporting on the U.S. diplomatic cables published by the website WikiLeaks. The British Foreign Office said the incident occurred on Saturday. Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor, said in a statement that Russia's move was ""a very troubling development with serious implications for press freedom."" But the Russian Foreign Ministry statement said the rules allegedly violated were set down in 1994 and are ""well known"" to all working journalists in the country. ""In particular, having applied for and received the extension of his accreditation at the end of November last year, Harding left Moscow for London for his own business without receiving a (new) foreign correspondent press card issued in his name, although he knew he should have done that. ""Therefore, if L. Harding is still interested in working in Russia during the validity term of his Russia visa, he needs to settle the issues related to his accreditation with the Russian Foreign Ministry Information and Press Department. ""If L. Harding complies with these rules, which are the same for all foreign correspondents, there will be no problems with his entry to the Russian Federation,"" the statement said. In a statement to Parliament, Britain's Minister for Europe David Lidington made reference to the accreditation issue but not specifically the foreign correspondent press card. ""Indeed, last November the Guardian approached us for support to secure Mr. Harding's reaccreditation as a journalist when his accreditation had been withdrawn. We made representations at a senior level and in the event, Mr. Harding was granted an extension of his accreditation as a journalist."" Lidington said Harding had not been ""given any explanation for his exclusion"" and deplored any restrictions on free media and freedom of expression. ""We understand that Mr. Harding had previously been warned by the Russian authorities about several alleged violations of his status as a journalist -- including visits without permission to border zones and classified areas,"" he said. Lidington said Harding ""knows Russia well and has, over the last four years, given readers of the Guardian genuine insight into that country."" Assigned to Moscow since 2007, Harding covered many events, including the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia and the twin suicide attacks on the Moscow metro system in 2010. He also wrote a number of controversial articles, including one on the speculation surrounding the alleged secret wealth of Russia's powerful prime minister, Vladimir Putin. Last year, Harding was reprimanded by Russian authorities for unauthorized travel to areas closed to journalists. ""It is worrying that the Russian government should now kick out reporters of whom they disapprove. Russia's treatment of journalists -- both domestic and foreign -- is a cause of great concern,"" Rusbridger said.

"(CNN) -- Steve Jobs, who resigned as CEO of the world's largest tech company late Wednesday, is often identified as the singular face of Apple -- the man who is the energy and creative spirit behind the company. But Apple is much more than just Steve Jobs. Jobs himself has said so in the past. ""Apple is an incredibly collaborative company,"" Jobs said in an onstage interview at a tech conference last year. ""We're organized like a startup. We're the biggest startup on the planet."" Not everyone buys this argument, of course, and Apple stocks fell 5% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after his resignation was announced in a letter. Jobs has been elected as Apple's chairman, but some observers question how much he will be able to contribute due to health reasons. The 56-year-old went on a medical leave of absence earlier this year, his third time as CEO. At the AllThingsD tech event last year, Jobs boasted that Apple's corporate structure doesn't include committees, which is a common practice among big business for distributing the responsibility for strategy among key executives. A different person leads each hardware, software and business division, he said. ""Teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks to come through with their part without watching them all the time,"" Jobs said at the time. ""We're great at figuring out how to divide things up into these great teams that we have and all work on the same thing, touch bases frequently and bring it all together into a product."" Furthermore, Apple has a succession plan in place. Tim Cook, the operations wizard who is replacing Jobs as CEO, already has proven himself an adept manager. Cook filled in as interim CEO during Jobs' three medical leaves. Jobs announced his most recent absence in January, and Cook has taken over his duties since then. Apple has set business performance records during every quarter this year. In his resignation letter, Jobs wrote that he strongly recommended Cook's appointment. ""I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it,"" Jobs wrote. ""And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role."" ""Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and valuable technology company,"" Art Levinson, an Apple board member, said in a statement, adding that the board ""has complete confidence that Tim is the right person to be our next CEO."" The CEO of any company has an important role, but Apple is structured in a way where it's less so, according to Jobs. Jobs' influence touches practically all facets of the company, analysts say. In the onstage interview, Jobs described his role as having to meet with the various units and contribute ideas. But what features make it into the next iPhone or iPad is often determined by the people who are dedicated to working on their respective products, he said. ""If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions, and you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy,"" Jobs said. ""The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don't stay."" At Apple, the good people Jobs is referring to are part of the ""top 100,"" a group that convenes regularly at off-site locations to share ideas, according to a recent Fortune article. A smaller group of executives also meets weekly to discuss the business, Jobs said. ""We all meet for three hours once a week, and we talk about everything we're doing,"" Jobs said. ""And there's tremendous teamwork at the top of the company, which filters down to tremendous teamwork through the company."" As Jobs' managerial presence dwindles, Apple is in no immediate danger, because his thinking has been ingrained into many of the company's 46,600 employees, industry analyst Tim Bajarin said in a statement. Apple outlines its product plans five years in advance and ""has a deep bench of executives who know how Steve Jobs thinks, what his vision is for the next decade and are more than capable,"" Bajarin wrote. Jobs and others have indicated that Apple is poised to continue producing popular products, and so most consumers won't notice a change, Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester Research analyst, said in a recent interview. ""I don't think the average person cares what's going on with Apple's leader,"" she said. Apple is driven by ""core values,"" Jobs said last year, not by one man. ""We have the same values now, as we had then,"" he said. ""We're a little more experienced, certainly beat-up, but the core values are the same.""","Apple founder Steve Jobs says he is not the sole decision maker at Apple .

"(CNN) -- If you're looking to upgrade your car this year, you can ignore fuel injection, turbo charging, power steering and a streamlined chassis -- the new breakthrough that will improve your ride is an iPad. OK, it might be a slight exaggeration to say Apple's much-vaunted tablet computer is helping re-shape the motor industry, but as manufacturers try to cram more technology into vehicles, they are looking at devices like the iPad to help them. While the dashboards of many cars of today are groaning with gizmos such as satellite navigation, DVD players and MP3 interfaces alongside traditional odometers, tomorrow's vehicles are likely to replace the lot with a single computer. This year's Geneva Motor Show saw several new vehicles integrating the iPad into their dashboards, most notably Volkswagen's classic campervan update, the electric-powered Bulli microbus, and the Pixel microcar produced by Indian manufacturer Tata. CNNMoney gallery: Hot cars of the Geneva Motor Show . The iPad installation is part of a wider industry trend to fit Internet-connected computers into vehicles, a move that offers seemingly limitless opportunities for hauling the automobile into the digital age. But in the race to hook drivers up to the Web, there are concerns that the impact these distractions will have on safety are being overlooked. And, as rising fuel prices hike the cost of motoring, will such technology be jettisoned to save cash? The good news for gadget freaks is that computers are here to stay, says Gary Wallace, of ATX Group -- a leading developer of in-car telematics (devices that send and receive information). They not only appeal to buyers, he says, but also ensure efficiency. ""People want entertainment options and they want to be able to take what they're getting on other devices, whether its their laptop or iPad or iPod or smart phone, into the car,"" Wallace said. ""And that certainly is a powerful driver for the market."" With an Internet connection, he says, comes the option not only to monitor performance or control certain vehicle functions from a remote desktop, but also to outsource functions like satellite navigation or entertainment to another computer. ""We're looking at more offboard solutions; using connectivity into the vehicle to download offboard entertainment instead of trying to jam it into the central stack. You shed weight out of the vehicle which adds to fuel efficiency."" While vehicle manufacturers are starting to experiment with Internet connectivity, full deployment is dependent on the advent of so-called fourth generation -- or 4G -- wireless networks that will permit the data transfer speeds needed by moving vehicles. These networks -- offering downloads up to 10 times faster than 3G systems used by the latest smartphones -- are expected to start rolling out later this year in the United States. Some European countries such as Finland have already begun limited trials. But what about the safety issue? Do in-car computers mean drivers will be too busy poking their friend on Facebook to pay attention to the road? Alan Stevens, a research scientist at the independent Transport Research Laboratory in England, says that although vehicle manufacturers take safety very seriously, gadget- thirsty consumers are less conscious of the risks. ""There is certainly an eagerness to bring technology into vehicles because it is something consumers are now looking for -- something like iPod connectors are more important than another air bag,"" he said. Says Stevens, the danger is not so much from equipment fitted by manufacturers, but ""after-market"" or ""nomadic"" devices -- such as cellphones or navigation systems -- bought separately and installed by drivers. For vehicles using iPads or computers running Google's Android software, this could include apps downloaded without manufacturer's approval that distract drivers away from the task at hand. ""The point of these Internet devices are they are very attractive, they pull you in and they're not designed to be tasks that can be easily chunked in half-second glances,"" says Stevens. ""It's partly physical, not looking in the right place, and its partly mental not having enough spare capacity to deal with the unexpected situations."" That said, many technological innovations coming onto the market are concerned with improving vehicle safety. Not least voice-activated functions being developed by several automakers including Ford, which debuted its ""Sync"" system at Geneva. There's more to come, according to Wallace, with cars being developed that can notify insurers as soon as they are involved in accidents, saving money by speeding up the claims process. Systems are also being developed by General Motors and BMW that can alert emergency services, assessing how severe a crash is. These could even be integrated with electronic medical records. But even as technology marches on, not all is here to stay. Wallace says some gadgets, like devices showing real-time traffic data, can fall out of favor. And, like so many tape decks, eight-track cartridges and in-car record players (which briefly existed in the 1950s) before it, the iPad could soon be driving off into the sunset.","New vehicles displayed at Geneva motor show have iPads incorporated into design .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- The tiny Gulf state of Qatar will amend its labor laws in an effort to improve the living standards of migrant workers, its Interior and Labor ministries said Wednesday. The changes are based on recommendations published in a report by international law firm DLA Piper which Qatar commissioned last year to review workers' conditions. It followed months of criticism by rights groups and media reports alleging abuse and exploitation of laborers as the country prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. Among the notable amendments: expatriate workers no longer need their employer's permission to leave the country or to change jobs. DLA Piper's report said the old restrictions could ""result in a situation where migrant workers are 'trapped' in Qatar, with an abusive employer, and without means of exit or the ability to legally transfer to another employer for months."" Regulations over ""exit stamps,"" which are needed to leave the country, are also being eased under the proposed changes. ""It is alleged that employers / sponsors are using this [Exit Stamp] authority to prevent migrant workers from leaving Qatar thus giving rise to circumstances of apparent forced labor,"" DLA Piper's report said of the requirement for employers to issue an Exit Stamp. The amendments need to be approved by the consultative body known as the Shura Council, then the government, before they become law. No time frame has been given. The changes have been met with a lukewarm response from Qatar's critics. Amnesty International said it was a ""missed opportunity"" by Qatar. ""Proposed reforms announced by the Government of Qatar fall far short of the fundamental changes needed to address systemic abuses against migrant workers in the construction, domestic and other sectors,"" it said in a statement. The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) called the proposals ""cosmetic"" and added that ""modern slavery will still exist in Qatar."" ""There is no freedom of association, no minimum wage, and no effective labour compliance system,"" a statement said. Amnesty's researcher James Lynch added: ""While some of the measures announced today are positive and if implemented would improve conditions for workers, they do not go nearly far enough."" Ali Al-Khulaifi, Director of Planning and Quality Department at the Ministry of Labor, said that minimum wage would continue to be determined by the individual agreements between Qatar and home countries of migrant workers. When asked about trade unions he said they were still studying the options.","Qatar will amend its labor laws to improve the living standards for migrant workers .

"(CNN) -- In rural Boulder County, Colorado, Loretta Ford felt as if she were an epidemiologist, a sanitation department and a health inspector -- but in title, she was a nurse. She and colleagues carried everything, including the baby scales, as they set up temporary clinics in churches, schools and wherever else they could. In the 1940s and '50s, there was no one else taking care of these basic community needs except Ford and her fellow public health nurses. As she gained experience, Ford realized that more nurses should be able to have specialized training so they could make basic decisions on their own about the health status of patients. Ford, 90, the co-founder of the nurse practitioner movement, is being inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame on Saturday in Seneca Falls, New York. Thanks in large part to her efforts, there are more than 140,000 nurse practitioners working in the United States today. Many can prescribe and diagnose as doctors can, but their nursing background emphasizes health promotion and patient empowerment. ""I'm pretty proud of them. I get a lot of credit for 140,000 nurses and I don't deserve it,"" Ford said in September. ""They're the ones who fought the good fight. They took the heat and they stood it and they've done beautifully."" Who are the nurse practitioners? Nurse practitioners are allowed to have independent practices in 16 states and the District of Columbia, and that number is growing -- two joined the list in 2011. In all states, they can prescribe most medications, although in some states they must collaborate with a physician for prescriptions (The Center to Champion Nursing in America has this map showing restrictions). There are 6 million visits to nurse practitioners every year, according to the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners. They are in high demand, because there is a shortage of primary care doctors in the United States, where a huge chunk of the population is approaching old age and high obesity rates are aggravating diabetes and heart disease levels. Although the training is different from medical school, nurse practitioners do invest a great deal of time in education: usually a bachelor's degree in nursing and then two to four more years getting a graduate-level degree, sometimes in a specialty area such as family practice. About 93% of nurse practitioners have graduate degrees, and there is currently a proposal by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing to require a doctorate-level degree to become a nurse practitioner by the year 2015. The nurse practitioner philosophy is a holistic approach to the health of the patient, Ford said. Nurse practitioners focus on health, functionality and daily living, and giving the patient feedback. ""The end result, of course, is to empower the patient or the family or the person to advance to self-care and to be responsible for that,"" Ford said. Ford had wanted to be a teacher, but because of cost concerns she went to nursing school instead. During World War II, she worked as a nurse at various U.S. Army and Air Force bases. When the war ended, she attended the University of Colorado School of Nursing and earned bachelor's and master's degrees. Ford's journey . The 1960s were a time of social and political upheaval, and Ford saw that chaos as an opportunity to start something new. She collaborated with pediatrician Dr. Henry Silver to start the nation's first pediatric nurse practitioner program in 1965 at the University of Colorado's Schools of Medicine and Nursing. They were interested in expanding public health nurses' roles, emphasizing prevention and health promotion. ""Here she is practicing in rural Colorado, she sees a need for a new profession, a better way of doing things, something that could really enhance health care and bring health care to more people, and so she created the whole profession,"" said Penny Kaye Jensen, president of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners. ""That's just an inspiration to all of us."" Her colleagues were concerned that she was working so closely with a doctor in this program, Ford remembers. They feared the model would become more about nurses being supervised by physicians rather than serving as colleagues and partners. There were also a lot of questions about whether state laws would permit what they were teaching: Could nurses use devices like stethoscopes? Could they make decisions about the health status of children? ""There was great concern, I think, that the kind of direction that we were taking was much more medical than nursing,"" Ford said. ""It's not easy when you have to buck some of the old prejudices and some of the demands of faculty that's set in its ways, so to speak."" At the same time, professional organizations were calling for nurses to be specialists in clinical areas and more independent in making decisions, but also interdependent in a team relationship with doctors. ""These are all things the profession was saying, but the rhetoric and reaction were quite different,"" Ford said. ""It took a while before there was more acceptance of it in schools of nursing."" Ford always thought nurse practitioners would be able to practice independently; it's only recently that autonomy has been legalized in several states, but there has always been a clear need, she said. ""A lot of them were doing it anyway. Now this has legitimized it,"" Ford said. ""We were the 'Lone Rangers.' We had to make decisions."" Ford at Rochester . After the success of her program in Colorado, Ford became the founding dean of the University of Rochester School of Nursing in 1972. By the 1980s, nurse practitioner programs had started cropping up all over the country. Kathy Rideout said that when she joined the nursing school faculty at Rochester in 1985, a nurse practitioner practicing independently was still unheard of, and there was no national certification. Rideout had done her education at the University of Pittsburgh, but the Pittsburgh area didn't have many nurse practitioners. Rochester, on the other hand, was full of them, thanks in part to Ford. Rideout, now interim dean of the school of nursing, remembers Ford taking the time to interview her when she came to the school. The younger woman was anxious, but Ford immediately calmed her. Ford wanted to know what her dreams and passions were. ""She has a quiet leadership style. She is a listener, she is a great thinker and she has the ability to really put you at ease,"" Rideout said. ""That's really at the heart of who she is."" Ford retired about a year later, but has remained involved with the University of Rochester School of Nursing through financial support, mentorship, fundraising and other activities. The school now has nine specialty nurse practitioner programs, including child psychiatry, which helps fill a need for mental health services in rural upstate New York, Rideout said. But the field seems to be getting broader, so nurse practitioners are trained in more general areas first with the option to specialize, she said. Nurse practitioners today . The four components of Ford's vision for nurse practitioners -- the ability to assess, diagnose, treat and evaluate -- have not changed since the early days, but the extent to which they do those things has evolved, and so has their independence, Rideout said. One of those nurse practitioners who operates with that relatively recent independence is Angie Golden, who has had her own primary care family practice near Flagstaff, Arizona, for eight years. What she does is similar to a family practice physician, but her nursing background has given her an emphasis on ""the caring and the curing of health care,"" she said. About two years after Golden became a nurse practitioner, a patient came into her office who confirmed all the reasons she had wanted to go into the field. The patient had been struggling with chronic back pain and had seen various health care providers, but couldn't find the right combination of therapies that would allow her to resume her work as a jewelry sculptor. Golden worked with the patient to attack the problem from many angles: pain medicine, physical therapy, acupuncture and meditation. The alternative approaches helped the patient feel more in control of her pain, and she did go back to work. ""When you get to work with a patient to help them find the therapies that are going to let them have the quality of life that they want, I just don't think it gets any better than that,"" said Golden, who is also the president-elect of the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners. Julie Willardson, 36, who received her nurse practitioner doctorate degree in May, came into the field because she was frustrated that, as a home care nurse, she'd have to wait several days -- sometimes even a week -- to get a doctor's order to request laboratory work or other relatively simple procedures. Having practiced in multiple nursing specialties and attained this advanced education, Willardson doesn't regret having chosen nursing rather than medical school. ""I've had patients tell me things they've never told anyone in their life. It's really been an honor,"" Willardson said. ""I'm sure doctors love being a doctor, too, but I don't know if they get the full human side of medicine."" In fact, a 2010 Gallup Poll found that Americans view nurses as the most honest and ethical professionals, rating them higher than medical doctors and police officers. As for Ford, who had wanted to go into public school teaching, she's glad her life took her the way of nursing before giving her teaching opportunities in higher education that have left behind a lasting legacy. Nursing, she said, has enhanced the quality of her and her families' lives, and given her the privilege of meeting and serving many interesting people. ""It's amazing the strength these patients have, and stamina and optimism in the face of some very dire prognoses. They're admirable,"" she said. ""I've been blessed.""","Loretta Ford, 90, is being inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame on Saturday .

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 21 militants were killed in Pakistani airstrikes Sunday in a volatile area close to the Afghan border, officials said. Ten militants died as jets targeted their hideouts in the Khyber tribal district, Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations reported. The strikes demolished four hideouts, officials said. Separate strikes killed 11 militants and destroyed two terrorist hideouts in another remote village in North Waziristan, sources said. Drone strikes kill 8 in Afghanistan, Pakistan . North Waziristan is a Pakistan Taliban stronghold in the country's loosely governed tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. The area is dangerous and hard for journalists to reach, making it difficult to independently verify the military account. Military and local sources on the ground said the militants were affiliated with the Pakistan Taliban. Militants from Tehreek-e-Taliban, or TTP, have long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government and have claimed a number of violent attacks. Early this year, the government suspended peace talks with the group. Pakistan's northwestern region is home to loosely governed tribal areas. It's also a base for foreign fighters and a refuge for members of the militant Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- After a lukewarm reception from television buyers, 3-D technology is pushing its way onto small screens. As Nintendo plans to launch with the first major gadget that can show three-dimension visuals without the need for special glasses in the U.S. on Sunday, two large Asian electronics manufacturers are following suit. HTC has unveiled the EVO 3D, a follow-up to Sprint Nextel's breakout smartphone. It has a 4.3-inch touchscreen, which can display eye-popping 3-D without needing glasses. Users will also be able to capture photos and videos in 3-D using a pair of cameras on the back. Like the original EVO, the 3D version will run Google's Android operating system and connect to Sprint Nextel's fast 4G data network. LG Electronics has been working for a year and half on a 3-D smartphone of its own, said Yongseok Jang, the South Korean company's vice president of strategy. The Optimus 3D, as it's been called, will launch on AT&T Mobility's network with the name Thrill 4G. AT&T says it will be available in the ""coming months,"" and a price hasn't been set. LG developers spent a great deal of time fine-tuning the pair of 5-megapixel cameras to accurately capture 3-D media, Jang said. Calibrating the cameras to produce good-looking stills and video is more difficult than pulling off a glasses-free display, he said. The EVO 3D prototype we tested at the CTIA Wireless conference this week shot blurry video. HTC is still working on that aspect, which will probably take several more months to perfect, said Trevor Van Norman, a Sprint marketing director. The EVO 3D will be available this summer, he said. Nintendo's 3DS also has a pair of cameras for capturing scenes in 3-D, and it works quite well. Being the first out of the gate to offer a mainstream glasses-free 3-D gadget, Nintendo expected to find competitors, and it soon did when LG announced its phone. ""I wasn't frustrated or irritated by it,"" Hideki Konno, a Nintendo producer who played a key role on developing the 3DS, said through a translator in a recent interview. ""I mean, considering the technology was out there in the world, I wasn't even really surprised by it."" The Japanese game company plans to fend off competitors by partnering with media publishers that can offer more games and movies in 3-D. ""You need not only the capabilities; you need the content,"" Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of America's president and operating chief, said in an interview. ""They're not going to have the great gaming content that we have."" For their phones, LG and HTC are lobbying game developers to create 3-D software for Google's Android smartphone platform. Owners also will be able to download the thousands of games already available for Android. LG expects to include a few games packaged with the Thrill 4G and have at least 10 games available when the device is made available to purchase, Jang said. With a team led by Jang, LG also persuaded Google to make YouTube videos produced with 3-D cameras available in a separate app and allow the phone's users to upload their own, Jang said. ""Instead of being at the mercy of Hollywood studios to bring 3-D content, why don't we enable our customers to create their own 3-D content?"" Jang said. Google's YouTube team also helped LG tweak the quality of the videos produced by the phone, he said. The EVO 3D will have about a half-dozen 3-D games at launch in addition to the full ""Green Hornet"" film, Van Norman said. The phone will also have the YouTube 3D application. HTC touts on its website: ""You look better without the 3D glasses,"" as a hand tosses a pair into a trash can. LG's initiative, too, was designed to eliminate the need for wonky glasses, Jang said. ""All our TV guys and our mobile-phone guys, we try to solve that problem -- to force people to wear glasses,"" Jang said. ""Watching 3-D stuff should not be a sit-up experience."" Both LG and HTC are planning to debut tablet computers that can, like their phones, capture 3-D with a pair of cameras. However, the tablets require users wear dorky, two-toned glasses in order to view the 3-D content. HTC's tablet, with its 7-inch touchscreen that requires glasses for 3-D viewing, is called the EVO View 4G and will be available on Sprint. Jang from LG, which is bringing a tablet to T-Mobile USA's network, said implementing glasses-free 3-D on the G-Slate's 9-inch screen was ""a cost issue."" However, by enabling the device to capture 3-D pictures and video, Jang hopes the excitement carries over into LG's TV business, which has struggled to sell 3-D sets. T-Mobile, the G-Slate's exclusive carrier, believes that it's still ""early days"" for 3-D technology and that issues will be solved over time with new devices, said Desmond Smith, a senior product manager for the company. Samsung Electronics hasn't ventured into the mobile 3-D territory yet. ""There has been a big push for (3-D) on the TV side, but we haven't done anything on the phone side,"" said spokesman Kim Titus. Omar Khan, the strategy chief for Samsung Telecommunications, said mobile devices will be more valuable in the 3-D space as a way to capture content in that format, rather than to view it. ""I think it's still pretty early,"" he said.","HTC and LG are prepping smartphones that can display 3-D without needing glasses .
The two companies are also working on 3-D tablets, but those will require glasses .
Nintendo executives say HTC and LG will struggle to find 3-D content ."
"(CNN) -- Brazilian footballer Neymar has given the thumbs up to political protests during this summer's World Cup in Brazil -- as long as they are peaceful. Demonstrations -- some violent -- have been taking place all over Brazil since last summer's Confederations Cup, raising concerns about security at the upcoming tournament. They were originally organized to protest against increases in travel fares, but have since gone on to include demonstrations against staging the World Cup in Brazil, corruption in government and a lack of social spending. ""My opinion is that protesting, there's no problem with it, as long as it is peaceful without violence, without vandalism,"" said Neymar, who was talking to CNN at a Castrol Footkhana event. ""If it's for Brazil getting better, they have to protest,"" added the Brazilian, who plays for Spanish club Barcelona. Smaller scale protests are still continuing, with many people earlier this month showing their disapproval following the death of a young man allegedly beaten by police, as city authorities attempt to drive armed gangs away from communities and restore authority ahead of the World Cup. To make matters worse for FIFA and organizers of the tournament, three of the 12 stadiums to be used this summer have yet to be finished. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has also spoken about the political backdrop in Brazil, arguing that any demonstrations taking place during the competition would have a negative impact on his squad. ""I don't know if it's the right time,"" Scolari said in an interview on TV show Fantastico. ""It could [affect my players], big time."" Winning the World Cup for the five-time winners would help Brazil banish the memories of the nation's darkest sporting hour -- letting a lead slip to allow Uruguay to become world champions in 1950, the last time the tournament was held on home soil. ""My advice is that they cheer for the national team until the end because they are important and we need them so that we can put more pressure in the game which will help us,"" added Neymar.","Neymar supports Brazilians right to protest during 2014 World Cup .

"Ansan, South Korea (CNN) -- They left school two weeks ago on a field trip with hundreds of classmates. They came back Wednesday without the scores of students who died at sea. About 70 survivors from the sunken South Korean ferry visited a memorial at the Danwon High School in Asnan -- the high school that sent 325 students on a field trip to Jeju Island. Inside the hallways, it didn't take long for the tears to flow. Many students sobbed as they walked past images of their classmates and hurried back onto waiting buses. For these students, school will never be the same. Losing hope . The ferry, en route from Incheon to Jeju, sank April 16 on the country's southwest coast. Any hope for survivors largely hinged on the possibility of air pockets within the sunken ship, which was carrying 425 people. Hundreds of relatives camped out near a harbor in Jindo, waiting for news. But after officials said there were no more air pockets, the grim reality set in. ""All we are asking for is bring the dead bodies out,"" a father wailed Tuesday. ""We know they are not alive now."" Videos capturing ferry's final moments fuel fresh outrage . Images of ferry captain abandoning ship are shocking . Lots of blame, no answers . As the web of blame widens, even the country's president is apologizing for the disaster that has killed at least 228 passengers. Another 74 people are missing, the South Korean coast guard reported early Friday. ""I am losing sleep as there is no news about saving more lives and because there are many families who don't know whether their loved ones are dead or alive still,"" President Park Geun-hye said Tuesday. ""I am at a loss for words for an apology that can be enough to console the pain and suffering even for a little while over insufficiency in efforts made to prevent the accident and also in the initial response to the accident,"" she added. ""We'll fix the problems and change our practices so we'll have safer nation and won't let them die in vain,"" Park said. South Korean authorities arrested have arrested three people on suspicion of destroying evidence connected to the ferry sinking. Investigators also raided a Coast Guard office in a probe of how officials handled the first emergency call from a passenger. The director and two other people with the Korea Shipping Association's Incheon office were arrested and accused of destroying evidence related to the probe of Chonghaejin, the company that owns the ferry. The Korea Shipping Association is a trade group that promotes the interests of the country's shipping industry. The site raided was the Coast Guard building in Mokpo, which includes the South Jeolla province emergency center -- a facility that provides 119 services, akin to the 911 emergency service in the United States.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Strolling between shelves crammed with his records, Zero Freitas pauses and finds another piece of music that he just must take home. He is walking through a warehouse where there are about 250,000 records. The room seems to stretch away with his records but it is only a fraction of the collection. Most of his five million records are in a former candle factory nearby, and another 100,000 are kept in his home -- for personal listening. Freitas pulls from the shelf a copy of ""The Country Blues of John Lee Hooker."" ""Marvelous,"" he chuckles. ""This is rare. I'm going to have to take it home."" Which is a problem of sorts. Freitas is trying to consolidate and catalog his massive vinyl collection, but every day he ends up finding some treasure or other that he sneaks out of the cataloging collection and off to his private stockpile at home. ""What I have at home is what I have mined over the course of my life,"" Freitas tells CNN at his warehouse in Sao Paulo. ""These days, it's things that appear out of nowhere, that I didn't even know I was looking for."" Freitas, 62, calls himself ""a hunter of lost sound."" He is a Brazilian bus magnate whose obsession has turned him into the owner of the largest known record collection in the world -- an estimated five million singles, albums and old 78s. ""Everyone thinks I'm obsessed with albums,"" he says. ""But really it's an obsession with memory and history, of Brazil and all of human kind."" For years he bought records -- sometimes individual albums and sometimes entire vinyl collections -- unnoticed. In high school, he already had 3,000 and by the time he was 30 he had amassed roughly 30,000 albums. A recent agreement with Brazilian authorities has allowed him to import whole shipping containers full of aging records and his collection has ballooned. When major international collectors or iconic shops like New York's Colony Records sold off their stockpiles, nobody really knew where they were going. But earlier this month, the New York Times revealed that Freitas was the eclectic buyer behind many of the transactions. ""Now I'm being hunted,"" Freitas laughs. He says most of the interest has come from sellers, but also from people searching for an obscure piece of music. He says: ""90 percent of the time, people are looking for something from their childhood. It's often culturally irrelevant music, but for that person extremely important. Freitas now wants to make his records available to the public as early as next year -- in a kind of listening library that he'll call a Musical Emporium. He has hired 17 interns to help him. Most of them history students. Wearing plastic gloves and surgical masks, they clean and dust the vinyl discs, photograph the covers and painstakingly catalog each album. They get through about 500 records a day and have so far cataloged about 250,000. A drop in the bucket. Freitas thumbs through some of the records from his personal collection that he brought in to show us: ""Wedding Album"" by John Lennon and Yoko Ono; a signed copy of Duke Ellington's ""New Orleans Suite;"" and not one, but four copies of the first album made by Brazilian crooner, Roberto Carlos, ""Louco por Voce."" ""Just the other day, we found an autographed Arthur Rubinstein that I didn't even know existed!"" he says, referring to the classical American pianist. But one of his most treasured discoveries, he says, is a rare recording of soprano Bidu Sayao, signed by the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Freitas bought it on eBay for one dollar.","5 million records stored in two warehouses and his home .

"(CNN) -- Razia Jan is fighting to educate girls in rural Afghanistan, where terrorists will stop at nothing to keep them from learning. Despite the threat of violence, Jan continues to open the doors of her Zabuli Education Center. She and her team are providing a free education to about 350 girls, many of whom would not normally have access to school. CNN asked Jan for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Razia Jan: I was in Bamiyan (an Afghan town northwest of Kabul) when I got a call in my room. I could not believe my ears. I started to cry, then I felt a great joy, and I started to laugh. I started to jump up and down. It is the greatest honor to be among these selfless human beings. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean to the Zabuli Education Center? Jan: It has given me more strength and determination to go forward to continue giving these girls an opportunity to get education and gain self-respect. It has given me a lifetime opportunity, a golden chance to continue my struggle to break the vicious cycle of violence against women and girls by providing education in a country where women have no rights to exist as an equal. I see a ray of hope that will shine all over the world and make them aware of a very small accomplishment that is changing the lives of these girls. From the day I opened the doors of the Zabuli Education Center, my effort was and is to provide security and the best education for these girls. Hopefully, they will have a better future. ... I'm the luckiest person in the world to get this honor and to help these kids. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Jan: All the money will go to the (Razia's Ray of Hope) foundation so we can continue to educate these girls. We've never closed the school, even during the holidays, so the girls are there during the winter. I want to buy them boots and jackets; all of them walk to school. And I would like to buy a new van for the teachers to transport them. My (big) goal is to build more classrooms. Every year I have 55 or 60 new girls, and space is really limited; they're small rooms. Also, I want to do adult education for the young women who have never been to school. I would like to start and help 20 to 25 women. Let's make their life a little better. These are very small things, but I think each step will make things better for each woman and each girl. It's changing their world. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Jan: All my life, I tried my best to be a helping hand to people and animals in need, even though what I have done was in the very small way that I could afford. It took a lot of determination and courage to build the first girls school in an area where the girls did not count. Now, with hard work, I have proven to the men of seven villages surrounding the school that this is the best thing that's happened for their daughters to get educated.

"(CNN) -- At least 230 people were killed and 190 injured when an oil tanker flipped over and exploded in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a government spokesman said Saturday. While the spokesman, Mende Omalanga, said five of the dead were United Nations peacekeepers, an official with the U.N. mission in the capital of Kinshasa contradicted the report. ""No U.N. members were killed"" in the explosion, said Madnodje Mounoubai. The tanker flipped over Friday afternoon, said Omalanga, the country's minister of communications. It was attempting to overtake a bus in Sange, in South Kivu province, on the country's eastern border. When oil began to spill from the overturned tanker, local residents attempted to collect the oil. One was smoking a cigarette, causing the tanker to explode, Omalanga said. The largest group of victims had been sitting in a bar near the accident site watching the World Cup match between the Netherlands and Brazil, he said. Some of the injured were being treated locally in surrounding villages, but most were sent to the nearby town of Uvira, Omalanga said.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton gave a full-throated endorsement of Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf on Thursday, delivering a fiery speech that hit Wolf's Republican opponent, pushed the larger Democratic midterm message and, at times, highlighted herself. Clinton's first public campaign rally was a noticeable departure for someone who, until now, has shied away from appearing on stage with candidates. In Florida, New York and Illinois, the former first lady has opted to tout candidates in tight races behind closed doors. Wolf, however, is a safer bet for Clinton, as most polls have the Democrat up by double digits over Republican incumbent Tom Corbett. ""I am here for one reason, as a proud woman for Wolf,"" Clinton said, touting the Democrat's focus on education and women. ""When you strip it all away, that is what this election is all about,"" she later added. Her speech, though, also sounded strikingly similar to stump speeches Clinton gives when touting herself. The former first lady talked up her Pennsylvania roots (her father's side of the family was from Scranton) and noted the importance of turnout by subtly referencing her failed 2008 presidential election. ""From my perspective, you can't count on things turning out the way you wanted,"" Clinton said. ""You've got to work for it."" And while two large Wolf for governor signs stood on stage in front of the roughly 900 attendees, the crowd clearly was more excited to see Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential candidate. Hillary Clinton's midterm campaign schedule . ""Listen, I am the one running for governor,"" Wolf said, half joking, when Clinton peeked her head around the curtain behind the stage and the crowd erupted in applause. Clinton touted Wolf as a ""fresh start,"" someone who would fight for Pennsylvania families and workers and ""turn around"" the state. ""I am pleased that you are all here supporting that campaign,"" Clinton told the supportive crowd. ""Because you are convinced, as I am convinced, that Tom Wolf is the right leader and the right time for Pennsylvania's hard-working people."" Before the public endorsement, the former first lady headlined a high-dollar, closed fund-raiser for Wolf. Campaign aides would not confirm how much money was going to be raised, but in the past Clinton has raised as much as $1 million for candidates. Clinton's event with Wolf offered a dramatic contrast to the time she spent with Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday in Chicago. While Clinton and Wolf stood in front of a cacophony of television cameras and cheering supporters, Clinton and Quinn spent most of their time together behind closed doors at a private fund-raiser. The only time Clinton and Quinn did spend in public was when the duo made an unannounced stop at a college Starbucks. One camera was invited. Clinton shook hands with well wishers and posed for pictures, while Quinn urged students to vote in November. The former secretary of state posed for countless pictures and many students asked her for selfies. Unlike Wolf, who is ahead in every poll, Quinn is an incumbent with an uphill battle to keep his job. The trend is more than just Quinn and Wolf, too. Last week in Miami, Clinton appeared behind closed doors with Charlie Crist despite the fact that the Democrat's campaign would have loved the image of the Florida gubernatorial hopeful standing with the former secretary of state. Crist's race to unseat Republican Rick Scott is close in nearly every poll. What's more, Clinton will appear next week in Michigan at an event with Gary Peters, the Democratic Senate nominee. Most polls have Peters up double digits over Republican Terri Lynn Land. That event will be open to the press.","Hillary Clinton endorsed Tom Wolf in the Pennsylvania governor's race .

"COCOA, Florida (CNN) -- Ask just about any college student, and they'll tell you they'd jump through hoops to avoid taking a class that meets Fridays. Brevard Community College used $267,000 in energy savings to add 10 new full-time faculty positions. So, it was welcome news to students when Brevard Community College in Cocoa, Florida, decided to experiment with a four-day workweek. A year ago, as energy costs headed up and the school faced cuts in state funding, college President James Drake, who drives a hybrid, decided to give the shortened workweek a try. It worked out better than anyone could have imagined, Drake says. ""If it weren't for the savings that we have netted from energy management and the four-day workweek, we would not have been able to do several of the vital things that are going to help us attract and retain even more students,"" Drake said. Brevard Community College began the four-day workweek during the 2007 summer session. The following fall and spring, it added a half-day but then went back to the four-day work week again this summer. iReport.com: Are you working a four-day week? Over that year-long period, by closing on Fridays and turning down the air conditioning and heating systems, the college saved $267,000 in energy costs. The savings allowed Brevard to hire 10 full-time faculty members.  Watch: Shorter work week boosts morale, productivity » . ""It was a great thing for me, because I became a full-time faculty,"" Betty Blaschak said. Blaschak teaches at Brevard's cosmetology school, where scissors and combs are moving a mile a minute as students learn how to style hair. Brooke Stile is one of those students, and taking classes four days a week instead of five makes a huge difference to her. ""The fact that I have that day, that one day, it's just so much nicer, and I just don't have to drive all that way to Cocoa,"" Stile said. Stile, who is a single mom, saves a 50-mile round trip with the four days of classes. She spends the extra day with her son, which means one less day she has to pay for child care. She says she can also get more done. ""The bank is only open till noon on Saturdays, so instead of doing it on Saturdays, I can do it on Fridays,"" Stile said. ""And go grocery shopping and there's not going to be a lot of people there.""  See who else is trying a four-day workweek » . Evers, who drives nearly 100 miles a day from Orlando, Florida, to take a biology class at Brevard, saves gas and says the Friday off is a win-win. ""I get an extra day to go to work, and I have an extra day to study,"" Evers said. The four-day workweek at Brevard has yielded even more positive results: There's been a 44 percent reduction in staff turnover, according to Drake. ""We have had a 50 percent increase in applications for employment during the same period this year as opposed to last year,"" Drake said. Mili Torres, the director of enrollment at the Cocoa campus, says her staff members rarely miss work. ""Absenteeism has actually gone away almost in my department,"" Torres said. However, the longer workdays of a four-day workweek have created some problems for people who need child care. For them, the school provides flex scheduling, which allows staff members to come in and leave earlier or later, depending on what is convenient. Drake says he often receives calls from other colleges and universities wanting to know how it's working. It's working so well that when the fall semester begins, Brevard Community College will shift to a year-round four-day workweek. Across the country, businesses, institutions and even one state are considering or have moved to a four-day workweek. In Utah, the state government has just gone into its second week of shutting down 1,000 buildings on Fridays. The state believes it can save $3 million by moving to a four-day workweek. But just as important as the savings is how employees are affected.  Watch: Utah first state to try four-day workweek » . Although the change has been a welcome relief to some workers, it's created hardships for others. Mylitta Barrett, a single mother, says the switch means she spends less time with her three sons. Barrett now needs a sitter in the mornings to care for her severely disabled son, Joseph, until his bus comes and says she has less time for her other boys as well. ""You can't make up the soccer game that I missed on Monday because you were working and didn't get home until seven o'clock at night,"" Barrett said. After 15 years with the state, she says she depends on the medical coverage and can't consider quitting. ""I don't like being thrown in this position where my life is going to get more difficult because of energy savings or whatever reason they decided to do this,""  Barrett said. But Barrett said she knows that hers is an extreme situation and that her supervisors are being as flexible as they can. Whether the four-day workweek will prove to be just a short-term solution to rising energy costs or is here to stay, only time will tell.","Brevard Community College began the four-day workweek in summer of 2007 .

"(CNN) -- Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman seems to think the world has had enough of his giant inflatable rubber duck. Following up on the recent launch of his supersized floating hippo in London's River Thames, Hofman's latest project -- Moon Rabbit -- is now on display in Taiwan. The location is fitting. The artist's giant inflatable rubber duck took Taiwan by storm -- even conquering a real storm along the way -- last year. Hofman's latest animal-themed installation is part of the Land Arts Festival, an annual outdoor arts and culture event held southwest of Taipei in the northern county of Taoyuan. This year, the event is taking place at a former naval base and features artwork from international and local artists, including Li Zhen and Zhang Huan. Festival art dots the base's old bunkers as well as a 3.6-kilometer (2.2-mile) airplane runway. It's the first time the public has been allowed to visit the usually restricted naval base, home of the secretive Black Cat squadron from 1961 to 1974. Bunny on the bunker . Hofman's enormous yet adorable Moon Rabbit lies on a grass roof bunker, gazing at the moon. ""It's made from tyvek mostly -- a waterproof paper-like material,"" says Hsin-yi Hu, exhibition manager at Blue Dragon Art Company. The Taiwan-based company was responsible for bringing Hofman's new work to the festival. ""Hofman hoped to recreate the fluffiness of a real rabbit and we used over 12,000 pieces of tyvek on the piece,"" says Hu. ""The naval base is very windy. With the fur swinging in the wind, it actually makes the rabbit look more alive."" The Moon Rabbit was inspired by Chinese folklore associated with the Mid-Autumn Festival, which took place earlier this week. According to legend, the rabbit lives on the moon and is the companion of the moon goddess Chang'er. It's the second year Taoyuan has hosted the Land Arts Festival. Commonly known to international travelers as the home of Taipei's international airport, Taoyuan will be promoted and recognized as a special municipality by the government by the end of the year. ""Taoyuan has been an important industrial city in Taiwan,"" says Hu. ""But under the new status, it has been keen to strengthen its arts and culture scene as well."" In addition to art installations, the festival features creative markets, workshops and performing arts.

"Namib Desert, Namibia (CNN) -- It's thought to be the world's oldest desert. The sun has been beating down on it for at least 55 million years and it covers an area of around around 31,200 square miles. The Namib Desert is an unforgiving landscape but it's where Rob Johnstone chooses to spend his spare time. As the sun begins to set, the astronomer drives out to an abandoned airstrip in the middle of the desert and sets up his complicated telescope as the remnants of the day's light disappears. ""This landscape is ideal for stargazing,"" says Johnstone, ""because if you look around you, you can see a 360-degree panorama of the horizon."" ""We really have an unobstructed view of the night sky. There's literally no light pollution whatsoever. It's completely dark. That is what we're looking for and that is what makes this area so incredibly special."" The Namib Desert is largely unpopulated, extremely calm and, therefore, incredibly dark. This makes it one of the best places in the world to stargaze. Read more: Ghost towns and wild horses in the desert . ""This is where the stars shine - they don't twinkle, they shine,"" Johnstone says. He spends as much time as possible gazing at the skies: ""I haven't discovered anything of importance yet, like maybe a comet or dwarf planet, but I'm still young -- I've got plenty of time left."" Last year, the International Dark Sky Association selected this area as an international dark sky reserve, which means it has one of the darkest skies measured on Earth. It is the first place in Africa to be given the title and one of only four other places in the world. Johnstone first decided to pursue astronomy when he saw Halley's comet in 1986. Now he travels around Namibia, providing stargazing and astronomy education through his company, Space Observation Learning Namibia. His goal is to have more young heads in the clouds. ""Nobody looks up anymore,"" Johnstone laments. ""When you look up into the night sky through a telescope like this, it makes you feel very small, especially when you find out how big some of the stars are. Antares, which is a red supergiant star, is 550 times bigger than our own sun."" Namibia's night sky is one of its greatest tourist attractions, but with the country's increasing development comes the threat of light pollution. Introducing too much light to the area will damage ecosystems as well as stargazing opportunities. Night-time lighting can disturb the sleep patterns of animals, which can alter feeding and mating behavior. Absalom Vilho is an environmental educator at Nadeet, the Namib Desert Environmental Education Trust. He lectures visiting students about how to lessen light pollution and has made it his mission to teach fellow Namibians about sustainable lifestyles that will keep the sky pristine. He feels a very personal attachment to the Namibian sky. ""If I think back to when I was young, I was always told stories by my grannies associated with something to do with the stars up there,"" he says. ""It's something I grew up with from a young age. I don't want to wake up one day and find it gone."" Though funding is a challenge, along with keeping up with the latest equipment, Johnstone is also determined to enlighten more people about Namibia as an ideal location for stargazing. For him, one glimpse into deep space makes it all worth the effort. ""I think the one big question everybody asks is 'are we alone?' -- Is there other life out there? ""You know, given the size of our milky way galaxy, which is 100,000 light years in diameter, and the fact that almost every single star we see is a double star -- in other words it's two stars orbiting each other -- and there are planets orbiting around those, it suddenly makes you feel not alone anymore.""","Namib Desert is one of the best places in the world to stargaze .

"(CNN) -- While their peers were playing video games or panicking about the prom, a group of young whiz kids has been prioritizing medical innovation. From Maryland to Dubai, these social-minded prodigies are winning prizes at international science fairs, developing medical innovations and picking up advanced degrees in hopes of saving lives. Here are eight of the most impressive kids from around working towards a healthier tomorrow. Joshua Meier, 18, New Jersey . Stem cells are valued for their ability to develop into specialized cells, and have the potential to treat Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injury and other conditions. But artificially generated stem cells have short lifespans that limit their medical usefulness. Joshua Meier's award-winning research, which started off as a class project when he was just 14, identified the genes linked to this cell aging process. Meier, who will begin studying biology and computer science at Harvard this fall, hopes that his research can be applied to other cells, and eventually lead to real-world solutions, like treating cancer. ""Cancer is a disease where cells keep growing and growing and growing,"" Meier says. ""But if we age cancer and stop its growth, then that's a potential treatment."" Adeeb Alblooshi, 10, Dubai, United Arab Emirates . It was a trip to the beach that sparked Adeeb Alblooshi's inventing career. When his father -- who had suffered from polio -- could not go swimming because of his prosthetic leg, Adeeb, then six, made him a waterproof alternative using an enhanced medical wax coating. Soon after, he created a small vibrating robot to help his mother clean small spaces. It wasn't long before the media, and subsequently the Dubai government, came calling. With the government's supervision and funding, he's come up with five more inventions since then, including a seat belt that monitors a passenger's heart rate and alerts the authorities when it's too high or low. Since April, he's been on an international scientific tour with the Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology, which has had him attending academic conferences, meeting with researchers, and even attending space camp at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Alabama. ""I've learned a lot, but most importantly, I'm having fun while doing it,"" he says. Samantha and Michelle Marquez, 18 and 15, Virginia . For Samantha and Michelle Marquez, science is a family affair. The daughters of a chemist and a chemical engineer, the two were always encouraged to ask questions and hunt down answers. A school project when she was in seventh grade led Samantha to create ""celloidosomes,"" three-dimensional structures built out of living cells, which act as a container for other particles. She suggests that these capsule-like structures could be used for organ repair and as innovative way to deliver drugs to the body, but anticipates that there could other applications too. ""I like to think that the celloidosomes is really just one very small pebble in the beach,"" she says, ""a very small grain of sand in the beach that's going to be the movement towards bottom-up engineering for medicine."" Michelle, on the other hand, decided to explore elements that couldn't be touched: music and emotions. Her research analyzed brain activity and found that highly complex sounds -- or chaotic noise -- triggered the part of the brain associated with negative emotions, while low-complexity music triggered the part of the brain associated with positive emotions. Both sisters were recognized at the prestigious Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF), but there's little sibling rivalry at play. ""I think it's been really great to see Michelle blossoming into the young woman, the young scientist that she is,"" Samantha says. ""I think she's kind of paving her own journey."" Sandile Kubheka, 21, Newcastle, South Africa . While others his age were just getting into the swing of university life, Sandile Kubheka, then 20, had become South Africa's youngest doctor, four years ahead of schedule. Since then, Kubheka, now 21, has been honored with a slew of awards for his community work and medical achievements, and was nominated for an MTV Africa Music Award for leadership. These awards acknowledge not just his obvious precocity, but the time he's put in outside of the classroom, especially when he was a student. On weekends, he was helping under-serviced communities, taking care of patients at a student-run clinic; during his December holidays, he was volunteering in the labs of rural hospitals, to serve the community and hone his own skills. These days, he's had to cut back. He spends most waking hours completing an intensive two-year internship at Grey's Hospital in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, but he finds time to act as an ambassador for the South African National Blood Service, and set up a trust fund to help youth in developing nations and rural regions get into engineering and medicine. ""Now that I've started working, it's harder to balance that,"" he says laughing. ""But as soon as I've got that balance, I want to get back to the community."" Tony Hansberry, 20, Jacksonville, Florida . Tony Hansberry was likely the only 14-year-old boy making a difference in gynaecology. Attending a high school with a program geared towards medicine gave Hansberry the chance to intern at the nearby UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida. There, he was challenged to improve how the vaginal cuff (the top of the vagina) is sutured after a hysterectomy. Typically, the cuff is sewn together with a horizontal stitch to decrease the risk of infection after surgery, but Hansberry suggested that a vertical stitch might be faster. When demonstrating his method on a mannequin, he was able to suture the area three times faster than the traditional method. It proved so much more effective that the supervising doctor still uses his method today, having nicknamed it the ""Hansberry Stich."" Now 20, Hansberry is studying chemistry at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University. He hopes to become a surgeon someday, and make a difference in the lives of others. ""That's what I love about the idea of medicine,"" he says. ""The fact that you can change so many lives with just your hands."" Jack Andraka, 17, Maryland . Jack Andraka was aged just 14 when he started developing an easy early-detection test for pancreatic cancer. By the end of the school year, he succeeded. The test, developed under the guidance of a Johns Hopkins professor, takes just minutes to complete, and Andraka claims it is faster, cheaper, and more sensitive than the current medical standard. Though his invention has yet to undergo peer-review or rigorous testing, it earned Andraka not only the $75,000 grand prize at the Intel ISEF in 2012, but also the attention of every major news organization, frequent speaking gigs (check out his TEDTalk here), and a seat on ""The Colbert Report."" It seems the whole world is waiting to see what he does next. Andrew Almazán Anaya, 19, Mexico City, Mexico . Andrew Almazán Anaya is best known for becoming a qualified psychologist at 16, but in his eyes, he still has a lot to accomplish. ""[I studied] not only because I wanted to learn more, or I liked the subject -- I have to make this knowledge useful for future,"" says Almazán Anaya, who is also an MD. This is why, for the last five years, he's been part of a team trying to perfect islet cell transplantation in diabetics -- working to prevent the cells from being rejected by a recipient's immune system. While the team awaits the OK to move from testing on mice to larger animals, Almazán Anaya has more time to dedicate to ""Centro de Atención al Talento"" (the Talent Attention Center), a group that pushes for the early identification and support of gifted children, where he serves as head of psychological research. He hopes his internationally recognized work will spread awareness about gifted kids, and equip them to make the most of their potential, as he has.","We look at eight of the world's most impressive young medical pioneers .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- She has reported from the front lines of conflicts around the world, interviewed world leaders, and investigated the important issues of our time. And on Tuesday, CNN's Christiane Amanpour received an honor from Queen Elizabeth II in recognition of her work. Christiane Amanpour's award recognizes her services to journalism. Amanpour received a CBE, or Commander in the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, ""for services to journalism."" The queen bestowed the honor on Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent, at a ceremony in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace, London. Wearing a white skirt suit and formal brown hat with a bow, Amanpour approached the queen and bowed. The queen, dressed in a bright blue dress, then pinned the medal on Amanpour's lapel. ""I'm incredibly thrilled and very proud,"" Amanpour told CNN afterwards. Amanpour and the queen briefly chatted during the ceremony, and Amanpour revealed afterwards that the monarch asked about CNN. ""I reminded her that she had actually opened the CNN London bureau, our new London offices, back in 2001 and she had a broad smile when I reminded her of that,"" Amanpour said. The medal is a blue and gold cross on a red ribbon with the motto, ""For God and the Empire."" The award was created in 1917 by King George V, who wanted a way to recognize the large numbers of people in the British empire who were helping in the effort during World War One. The CBE ceremony is formally called an ""investiture,"" with 20 held each year for those receiving the award. Amanpour said it was ""moving"" to witness active military personnel receiving the same award Tuesday -- as well as the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest military award. The award is considered a major honor for a British citizen and is one rank below knighthood. The British Cabinet Office, which approves the list of recipients, said the CBE rewards a ""highly distinguished, innovative contribution"" in the person's area of activity. Amanpour said she is especially proud that the award simply recognizes her work in journalism. ""I think that's what's important to recognize in the current climate,"" she said. ""With so much lack of seriousness, so much weight put to sensationalism and tabloidism, I think this is -- I say for myself personally -- a really nice moment to recognize that actually serious journalism is being recognized."" Amanpour has reported on most crises from the world's many news hotspots including Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Somalia, Rwanda and the Balkans. She recently completed a year-long investigation into religious extremism titled ""God's Warriors."" Amanpour has said she shares the honor with colleagues and friends who believe in the same kind of journalism, as well as those who have died or been hurt reporting from the front lines. But Amanpour -- born to an Iranian father and a British mother -- says it's also a great personal honor.

"London, England (CNN) -- More than 30 letters and cards written by the late Princess Diana were up for auction Saturday in London, revealing personal details such as how she liked to open presents early and that she had trouble coping with media attention. Most of the correspondence was to Diana's personal beautician, Janet Filderman, but the auction also includes notes to her chauffeur, Steve Davies, and Christmas cards with family portraits sent while she was still married to Prince Charles. ""Of course I opened your present!"" Diana writes in a letter to Filderman on June 28, 1985 -- three days before the princess's birthday. ""I have never been able to keep a parcel until the big day & I am not going to start at 24!!"" The letters date from 1984 to 1990, and show that the two women exchanged many gifts including flowers, picture frames and opera tickets. Diana frequently mentions in the letters that she liked opening gifts early. ""I rushed home to open your Christmas present, which I thought was quite good considering the 25th is actually two weeks away!!"" Diana wrote December 14, 1985. She refers to her son, Prince William, who was 3 at the time: ""I could not resist opening my present, as a parcel of any shape or form has never been safe with me & I fear that William has also picked up this dreadful habit from his mother, as I find wrapping paper undone in the most extraordinary places!"" On her birthday in 1988, Diana thanks Filderman for the gift of a letter opener and says she actually waited to open it on time. Estimates for the correspondence start at £200 ($314) and go up to £1,200-£1,500 for a letter Diana wrote in 1987 about her problems with public attention. The princess struggled with that until the day she died in a Paris car wreck 10 years later, after the paparazzi chased her car. ""I wish that I could cope with the media & peoples (sic) thirst for knowledge of us, but after six years I find everything that much more of a struggle & just cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" Diana writes to Filderman after a trip to Spain. ""I know there are a million people worse off than me & that I should do all that I can for them, but at the end of the day I have to live with myself & emotionally at the moment I am upside down & confused (so boring for those around me) & putting on this act is desperate, but if it keeps people off my back then surely it must be worth it,"" she writes. International Autograph Auctions, which was organizing the sale after being approached by Filderman, called it ""a letter of extraordinary and revealing content."" The auction also reveals intimate details about Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry. In one letter to Filderman just before Christmas 1988, Diana thanks her for sending treats to the boys and says ""the peanuts have been attacked."" On Christmas Day the year before, Diana thanks her beautician for sending a picture frame because she takes so many photos of her ""small men,"" the two princes. Included in the auction are thank-you letters written by young William and Harry, both on children's stationery and in a childhood script. ""Thank you for the James Bond video it is brilliant. Thank you. See you soon. With love from William,"" reads one letter, written on commercially printed ""thank you"" stationery that features a teddy bear writing with a quill at the top. The letter was written to Davies, their chauffeur, likely after William's ninth birthday in 1990, the auction house said. There is also a note from Harry to Davies from September 1990, when the prince turned 6. On stationery with a smiling elephant at the bottom and the words ""Thank You"" printed at the top, Harry writes, ""I love the video and sweets. Love from Harry.""","Newly auctioned letters offer fresh insight into Princess Diana's life .

"(CNN) -- Viola Davis got a nod for best actress from the Academy this year for her role as Aibileen Clark in ""The Help,"" and she must win, despite the controversy about the movie and the role she plays in it. If you believe what you read on blogs, black women long to be represented on screens large and small as rounded, complex characters, rather than wise, downtrodden burden-bearers and hot-blooded angry sex machines. Some say they want more black people telling black stories, which would be reasonable, if it were true. I have been black a long time, and I can tell you that black folks are a persnickety lot. To get consensus, things have to be done The Right Way -- but there's no consensus on what that looks like. However, we seem to know what it is not. Lee Daniels' ""Monster's Ball"" and ""Precious"" contained the wrong message (white people saving black people) and ""For Colored Girls"" was tainted by Tyler Perry, a gifted director and storyteller given to more commercial fare, whom some saw as the wrong messenger. The Popes of Blackness rarely agree on anything. One thing is certain -- Davis takes on a difficult role and breathes life into a hero who is inspiring, enraging, familiar and extraordinary. It is odious that the nominating committee gravitates to black people playing into conventional stereotypes. Nevertheless, that is not Viola Davis' fault. Given the state of the union, I think most any actor would be lucky to get work as a tree, forget about the layered role of a conflicted domestic in America's civil rights-era South. It is an incredible part, and Davis nails it. Not everyone is happy about that. You may recall that back when the film was released in theaters, the aforementioned Popes espoused their disgust for a black woman acting as a domestic, which naturally made white audiences curious, turning both the movie and the novel it was based on into something of a sensation. I'm not sure why white folks loved ""The Help"" so much -- maybe because many of them grew up with an Aibileen of their own. Films outside the comfort zone of mainstream black audiences seem to attract mainstream patronage en masse. Not that it matters, but from ""Birth of a Nation"" to ""The Color Purple"" and ""Glory,"" black outrage often translates to box-office gold. Maybe mainstream audiences are more willing to confront difficult stories objectively, as opposed to bringing all their discontent and political baggage and such while shouting expletives at the movie screen. I don't know what some black folks want from a film -- the Hollywood machine is an ugly marriage of art and business, propaganda and entertainment. People going to the cineplex in search of edification or some ethereal, cathartic moment of spiritual actualization should be in school or church -- because they expect more than they reasonably should from a movie. Author Kathryn Stockett once referred to her novel as ""civil rights fiction,"" which sounds more like bad PR coaching than a claim to take too seriously. The film, like the novel, is not about civil rights -- it is about prejudice, privilege and the price of dignity. It is about the things you learn about people when you step out of your comfort zone. The actress Octavia Spencer does her part, but Viola Davis carries this film on her back. Some may be discouraged to see a black woman get an Oscar nod for playing a house cleaner -- never mind that women in their 40s of every stripe are having a hard time everywhere in Hollywood. Viola Davis is a gifted actor -- smokin' hot! -- but not buxom, biracial or conventionally beautiful. She already has a truckload of Tony and other theater awards, just got a SAG award, and works steadily. Her nomination pushes an opening door even further, soliciting an appreciation for the beauty of dark skin, full eyes and lips, and a new beauty aesthetic for Hollywood to consider. ""The Help"" is decried for being a work of white liberal guilt porn, schmaltzy and sentimental -- which it is. But so what? There are flaws in the film, but Viola Davis is not one of them. Join the conversation on Facebook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of jimi izrael.","Viola Davis is nominated for an Oscar; jimi izrael says she must win .

"(CNN) -- It's early in the morning on a sunny mid-January day and Khensani primary school is buzzing once again. Cheers and laughter fill the schoolyard as groups of arriving pupils line up in rows under a big red kiosk. After a long summer break, it's back to school time -- and rules need repeating. ""The school starts at 10 to eight,"" principal Fannie Sebolela reminds the students sporting immaculate blue and crimson uniforms. ""You are supposed to be here by half past seven,"" he continues, ""so no late-coming because we have now started."" Khensani primary is a no-fee school at the heart of the Soshanguve township, some 20 minutes north of South Africa's administrative capital city Pretoria. This is a disadvantaged area, ringed by informal settlements where poverty and HIV prevalence is high. Read this: S. Africa's first black dean teaches reconciliation . When Sebolela took over leadership of the primary in the late 1990s, Khensani was an ailing and run-down school that was struggling to keep its doors open. But now, thanks to the hard work and determination of its principal, the school has become the pride of the region -- Sebolela has transformed Khensani into a model institution that is one of the top performing schools in the country. ""Every year we are making an improvement and this is what actually made more parents say 'I am taking my child to Khensani primary school,'"" says Sebolela. ""And yes, we want to change everything but it's not possible to accommodate every learner."" Sebolela's remarkable achievements have been acknowledged by his peers with several awards, including a win at South Africa's National Teachers Awards recognizing his excellence in primary school leadership. ""I firmly believe that nothing yields better results than working very hard,"" says Sebolela. ""You've got to work very hard for you to achieve anything and this is what I am striving throughout the way."" From gardener to top educator . Most of Sebolela's students, aged five to 12, come from very poor homes, much the same as he did. The award-winning educator was raised in a single parent family by a domestic worker mother. Poverty prevented him from staying in school so Sebolela went on to become a gardener, paying for his education with the money he made -- Sebolela did his Bachelor of Arts at the University of South Africa before gaining a Masters Degree from the University of Pretoria and a PhD from the University of Johannesburg, to name just a few of his educational qualifications. Read this: Elite boarding school aims to create Africa's future leaders . It took him 18 years. ""Most of the people think when you are a principal, you are coming from a well-to-do family,"" says Sebolela. ""It's not like that,"" he adds. ""It's how prepared are you, how do you see life -- you've got to see life beyond where you are and nothing is impossible. This is what I tell everybody, especially my children at school: if you want to achieve something, nobody will actually stand in your place. It's you who can turn things around."" Changing lives . Sebolela says one of the ways he manages to ensure his school keeps on achieving great results is to continually upgrade the facility and make sure his pupils have access to competitive teaching materials -- from new display boards and books to functional computers and bigger classrooms. Government schools struggle to maintain standards on the amounts of financial aid they receive from the education department. This has prompted Sebolela to often turn elsewhere --especially in the local business community -- to find support for his initiatives. ""I don't ask a donation or a sponsorship but I want to partner with this people,"" he says. ""As a partnership, there is a common goal that we want to achieve and that is education. And of course many people are eager as long as they see that the school is doing well. You've got to show people how well are you prepared and what is it that you are doing and probably they will assist you."" And although Sebolela is sometimes frustrated by the challenges he faces as he tries to keep his school in top shape, he refuses to give up. ""I don't fold my arms, and then sit and cry, I am going out and doing something,"" he says. ""And it's only that my resources are limited but I am prepared to go extra mile -- should I get any resource I would make it to the fullest and I think I would be able to change the lives of this community around.""

"(CNN) -- With Republicans back in control of the House of Representatives, a new power structure will emerge over the next few weeks. Republicans needed 39 seats to gain the majority, and are projected to gain 60 seats, the biggest shift in more than a half-century. House Republican Leader John Boehner is poised to lead the House Republican agenda, which promises to cut spending, repeal parts of President Obama's health care program and push targeted tax cuts for small businesses, which they say will lead to job growth. Boehner is known as a fiscal conservative who made spending reforms a key point of his campaign for House leadership. With may voters angered by what they see as out of control Washington spending, Boehner has reminded reporters that he's never requested any earmarks for his Ohio district. He has also been a powerful fundraiser for his party, which has solidified his position. As the magnitude of the Republican takeover was becoming clear, an emotional Boehner told supporters, ""Across the country right now, we are witnessing a repudiation of Washington ... a repudiation of Big Government ... and a repudiation of politicians who refuse to listen to the people."" ""He is the real deal,"" said Republican strategist Mary Matalin. ""He will run that place not seen since the likes of [former Speaker of the House] Tip O'Neill."" Boehner, who will likely be voted speaker by his party when Congress returns on November 15, twice during his speech said that despite a landslide Republican victory in the House, it was not a time for a victory lap. ""Listen, I'll be brief, because we have real work to do -- and this is not a time for celebration ... not when one in 10 of our fellow citizens are out of work ... not when we have buried our children under a mountain of debt ... not when our Congress is held in such low esteem,'' Boehner said. And while, as his aides said, it was too early to pop the cork on any champagne bottles, Boehner is already using the Republican victory as leverage against the White House. ""We hope President Obama will now respect the will of the people, change course, and commit to making the changes they are demanding,'' Boehner said. ""To the extent he is willing to do this, we are ready to work with him."" Boehner, the House Republican leader, watched much of last night's results with wife Debbie at the National Republican Congressional Committee's command center at Washington's Grand Hyatt Hotel, where he also started calling Republicans who won their races. The 10-term congressman also made Skype calls, including one to a group of Tea Party activists from his home district. ""I'll never let you down,'' he told the crowd to a standing ovation before signing off. Virginia's Eric Cantor is expected to become the next majority leader, the second-ranking position in House leadership, replacing Democrat Steny Hoyer. Cantor echoed Boehner in his victory speech to a hometown crowd in Richmond, Virginia. ""The future is in our hands, so let's roll up our sleeves, let's get to work, and the result must be to return America to the land of opportunity, responsibility and success,"" he said. Cantor is currently the Republican whip and the current deputy whip, California Republican Kevin McCarthy, said he will run for the post. McCarthy served as the head of recruiting for the House GOP for the midterm elections and led the effort to craft the GOP agenda project, called the ""Pledge to America."" Texas Republican Pete Sessions, who ran the GOP campaign committee, has also expressed interest in the whip position. Indiana Republican Mike Pence, who has made some high-profile appearances in Iowa and is considering a bid for higher office, potentially president or Indiana governor, is considering stepping down from his current position as the No. 3 Republican to focus on his future. Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling, a conservative who has bucked his leadership in the past as a former chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, is expected to run for the post. In effort to have diversity at the leadership table, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers, the vice chair of the Republican conference, will likely retain a similar post as the highest-ranking woman in the leadership. Because the freshman class will be large and includes a lot of conservative and Tea Party candidates, House GOP leaders are discussing including a seat at the leadership table for a representative from that group. But, it is unclear what position would be or who would get it, although one thought if it could go to the president of the freshman class. California Republican Darrell Issa, an outspoken critic of Obama, is expected to get the chair of the Oversight Committee. He said in a statement after the vote, ""The American people have sent a clear and direct message to Washington that they want less spending, limited government and more accountability. ""The mandate is clear: Advance an agenda that will create real jobs, not government jobs, but real jobs to get our economy moving again."" Issa has already said he plans to investigate the Obama administration's handling of the Wall Street bailout, the BP oil disaster and health-care reform. Other expected committee changes include: . Appropriations: Could be a fight between Jerry Lewis of California, the current ranking member, and Hal Rogers of Kentucky, the top Republican on the Homeland Security subcommittee. But both men have long histories of requesting earmarks, something Boehner is seeking to ban. The vote on this chairmanship could become a fight by those who want to show that GOP leaders are serious about cutting spending. Energy and Commerce: Since Texas Republican Joe Barton isn't expected to get a waiver of a three-term limit, the panel is likely to be a battle between Fred Upton of Michigan and Cliff Stearns of Florida. Budget: The chair should go to Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who is popular and well-respected by GOP members, but Boehner has distanced himself from Ryan's controversial proposal on entitlement reform. Ways and Means: The current ranking Republican, Dave Camp of Michigan, is expected to take the chair of the tax-writing committee. Financial Services: Spencer Bachus of Alabama is the current ranking member. Armed Services: Howard ""Buck"" McKeon of California is the ranking GOP member. Homeland Security: Peter King of New York is the top Republican. Judiciary: The current ranking Republican is Lamar Smith of Texas.","House Republican Leader John Boehner is expected to become the new House Speaker .

"(CNN) -- ""How do we explain this to children?"" The question echoed across the country Saturday night after a Florida jury cleared George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Trial watchers outside the Sanford courthouse cried and hugged after the verdict, which followed 16½ hours of deliberations. But the decision sparked shock and outrage well beyond Sanford in a case that has been racially charged from the start. Zimmerman's supporters applauded the jury for siding with the neighborhood watch volunteer's claims that he shot the teen in self-defense. Others said prosecutors failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. But their voices were drowned out by those who viewed the trial as a referendum on race that confirmed what some said they knew all along: . ""Can't be surprised... Black life has no value in this country,"" rapper QTip said in a tweet that was shared more than 2,000 times. 'Sanford has changed for the better' Demonstrators gathered Saturday in New York, Tallahassee, Chicago and other major U.S. cities for mostly peaceful protests, while civil rights groups and leaders, from Rev. Al Sharpton to Rep. John Lewis, expressed disappointment with the verdict Saturday. Images of people in hooded sweatshirts flooded Twitter and Instagram tagged with combinations of #hoodsup #JusticeforTrayvon and #RIPTrayvon. The 17-year-old was wearing a hooded sweatshirt when he left the home of his father's fiancee on February 26, 2012, to buy Skittles and a drink from a convenience store. He was on his way back when Zimmerman spotted him walking through his gated community and called 911 to report a ""suspicious"" person in a ""dark hoodie."" He was not charged until a groundswell of protest forced officials to reexamine the case. People took to the streets in ""hoodie marches"" and more than two million people signed a Change.org petition asking Florida prosecutors to bring charges against Zimmerman. A lawyer for Martin's family said Saturday the petition showed support for the idea that ""a black 17-year-old child should be able to walk home from the store and not be shot. ""I think they may have saved the life of another child -- because I think that from now on, if there is someone who wants to follow someone with a gun, I think they'll think twice about it. And so for those people, I say thank you,"" Natalie Jackson said Saturday night. ""Sanford has changed for the better. And I think there is grace and dignity in what these people did in the peaceful protests."" A legacy of racial profiling . Others, however, saw less cause for hope in the case's outcome, calling Martin the latest victim of racial profiling in a legacy that includes Rodney King, Sean Bell and Oscar Grant. For many, the verdict confirmed that ""walking while black is a crime punishable by death,"" as Twitter user Lola Ogunnaike said in a tweet that was shared more than 300 times. ""There will be a great deal said about what the verdict in this trial means, but most fundamentally we should understand that it means validation for the idea that the actions Zimmerman took that night were rational, the conclusions he drew sound, and that a black teen-ager can be considered armed any time he is walking down a paved street,"" author and educator Jelani Cobb said in a New Yorker column shortly after the verdict. ""The decision the six jurors reached on Saturday evening will inspire anger, frustration, and despair, but little surprise, and this is the most deeply saddening aspect of the entire affair. From the outset—throughout the forty-four days it took for there to be an arrest, and, then, in the sixteen months it took for the case to come to trial—there was a nagging suspicion that it would culminate in disappointment. Call this historical profiling."" Cobb was one of many who learned of the verdict after leaving a screening of ""Fruitvale Station,"" a film about the police-shooting death of Oscar Grant four years ago in Oakland, California. ""Not surprised. But distraught. Saw 'Fruitvale Station' tonight. How ironic to come home to this verdict,"" author Judy Blume said on Twitter. Of the verdict, Michael B. Jordan, the actor who plays Oscar Grant, said ""I cannot believe this is the America I live in right now."" Social media erupted in response to the verdict, although chatter began earlier in the day during deliberations. ""The fundamental danger of an acquittal is not more riots, it is more George Zimmermans,"" New York radio host Jay Smooth, founder of WBAI's Underground Railroad, said in a tweet that has been shared more than 8,000 times. ""Like, I think, a lot of us, I pretty much expected this. Doesn't make it ANY easier to take,"" he said after the verdict, echoing the sentiments of many. Mothers and fathers of various races wondered what this meant for their children. ""Here's hoping that all those kids out there in America buying Skittles with their #hoodsup stay safe tonight,"" Lauren Sir said. When stand your ground doesn't work . Critics brought up the story of a Florida woman who was sentenced to 20 years in 2012 for firing a warning shot to scare off her abusive husband. Marissa Alexander unsuccessfully tried to use Florida's controversial ""stand your ground"" law to derail the prosecution. Debate has swirled over the law, which allows those who believe they are in imminent danger to use deadly force to protect themselves. But a jury convicted Alexander of aggravated assault after just 12 minutes of deliberation. The case, which was prosecuted by the same state attorney who handled the Trayvon Martin case, gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who said the African-American woman was persecuted because of her race. But amid the sorrow, messages of peace and hope emerged. ""Change doesn't roll in on wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle. So we must straighten (our) ... backs & work 4 freedom,"" Cory Booker, mayor of Newark, New Jersey said, quoting Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. ""Bigotry & hate won't just quietly disappear - nor be defeated by more hate.

"Washington (CNN) -- At pricey fundraisers -- where there's plenty of freedom to offer an unvarnished view of the world away from the cameras -- President Barack Obama is sounding increasingly pessimistic about his party's chances in the midterm elections. At a Thursday fundraiser at the Los Angeles home of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Obama complained Democrats have a ""congenital disease"" during midterm cycles, repeating a diagnosis he has used before. ""We get depressed too easily,"" Obama joked. ""We're terrible at paying attention to midterm elections,"" he continued. The gloomy mood is understandable. Former top Cabinet secretaries, and even Jimmy Carter, are hammering his policies. Key Democratic candidates are avoiding him, and in at least one case, unwilling to say if she voted for him. Next month's elections loom at a moment of great hand-wringing for the president's party. Understanding full well Obama's unpopularity is a drag on some Democrats in tight congressional races, White House officials are signaling to party leaders and campaign managers alike there will be no consequences should they run away from the president in order to win. Obama has yet to acknowledge his own weak standing with the public at any of his political events. Instead, the president appears to blame what he describes as obstructionist Republicans and a polarized, vapid news media. ""We live in such a cynical time, partly because of how the media is now structured,"" Obama said at Paltrow's home. ""We only listen to folks who feed our biases and our inclinations. And bad news tends to attract the most attention,"" he added. At an earlier event in the day, Obama used stark language to label House Republican refusals to pass immigration reform ""suicide."" The president seemed to retool at least part of his midterm pitch, after declaring his policies are ""on the ballot"" in November, a line that his former strategist David Axelrod called a mistake. In Hollywood, there was a re-write to that declaration. ""My name is not on the ballot,"" Obama said in Los Angeles. ""But our values and our ideals... are at stake,"" he added, avoiding any reference to his ""policies."" Democratic candidates in critical races across the country are scrambling to distance themselves from both Obama and his policies, especially in the south where the president remains deeply unpopular. In Kentucky, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to answer whether she had ever voted for Obama during an appearance before the Louisville Courier-Journal editorial board Thursday. ""You know, this election isn't about the president,"" Grimes said. ""I was actually, in '08, a delegate for Hillary Clinton,"" she added. As he starts his own midterm push, the president is sticking to friendlier turf. In California, he made an unannounced stop at the campaign office of Democratic congressional candidate Ted Lieu, a state senator running for the seat vacated by outgoing Rep. Henry Waxman (D) California. ""California is right at the heart of the battle for control of the House,"" Obama said to volunteers at Lieu's call center. ""Because of just the day-to-day work you're doing, making phone calls, making sure our voters turn out, answering people's questions about what the issues are, it makes a difference -- that's how I was able to get elected."" White House officials reject the notion that the president's mood is grim. Obama's message at upcoming public campaign events will likely differ in tone and substance from remarks he makes at fundraisers, another official added. Obama will campaign with Connecticut governor Dan Malloy on October 15, White House officials announced Thursday. Obama's advisers argue the president still has the ability to excite base Democratic party supporters who were instrumental to his two successful runs for the White House. Steering clear of Obama, they argue, is also a gamble. ""We're not bringing him in to suppress voter turnout, if that's what you're asking,"" Malloy quipped to the Connecticut Post. As soon as the president steps onto the stage in Connecticut, the president's rhetoric will be placed under a microscope. ""Not a great way to go out of office, angry and blaming the system,"" former presidential adviser and CNN political analyst David Gergen said. ""My sense of it is he's on an emotional roller coaster,"" Gergen added. Once the midterms are over, Gergen suggested a reshuffling of top White House staff to buoy the president's prospects for his final years in office. ""If he shook it up a little bit, that would help,"" Gergen said.","Obama sounds increasingly pessimistic about Democrats' chances in the midterms .

"Editor's Note: Benjamin Todd Jealous is the president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which advocates for the rights of all persons and for an end to racial hatred and discrimination. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and wife Lia Epperson Jealous at the Image Awards in February. (ESSENCE) -- My 3-year-old daughter scampers into my lap. ""You are a silly goose ball, Daddy,"" she says laughing, delighted with her characterization of her father, who she thinks is a president just like Obama . When I explain to her that he is the big president and I am a little president, she gazes up at my 6-foot, 4-inch frame and says, ""You aren't little, Daddy  , you are a big president, too."" The love I hold for my precocious daughter defies words. I already know that when my baby starts dating, no man will be good enough for her. I'm not one of those dads who will hold her to some racially imposed requirement. I want her to choose whoever makes her happy, complements her soul, and respects her dignity as a woman. If that person happens not to be black, so be it. But I do want her to have a choice of African-American men. The disproportionate number of black men swept into the prison system threatens that hope.  Watch concern about marriage, apology for slavery » . According to The Sentencing Project, one in three black men born today can expect to go to prison, if the current trend continues. It goes without saying that we have to take responsibility for instilling values in our children that will help them stay out of the criminal justice system. It's a fact that the majority of young African-American men are not in jail, and millions are in college or working. Still, on any given day, one in every ten black men between ages 25 and 29 is incarcerated. And while black men remain disproportionately targeted by the criminal justice system, black women are one of the fastest growing prison populations. Much of this growth has come as a result of nonviolent drug offenses. Kemba Smith's now-familiar story is typical. She fell in the wrong crowd at school and got drawn into an abusive relationship with a drug dealer. Eventually, after enduring the relationship for four years, she was indicted and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. She was sentenced to 24½ years behind bars with no parole. Kemba served nearly seven years in a federal prison, gave birth to her son in jail, and only regained her freedom after former President Clinton granted her clemency following a worldwide outcry over her case. While Kemba is free today, raising her son, writing and advocating for other young women, her story is not unusual. One of every 100 African-American women 35 to 39 is in prison or jail, compared with 1 in 358 white women of that same age group. As more young black mothers get caught up in this dragnet of incarceration, many of their children are doomed to a foster care system that may bounce them from home to home, then kick them out at 18 to fend for themselves. Changing this paradigm is our moral responsibility and it's fiscally smart. It is cheaper to send nonviolent drug offenders to a drug treatment facility where they can get help than send them to prison. This is a perfect storm for change, a rare confluence of moral imperative and fiscal necessity. The economic and political shifts in our country have opened the door to advance policies that we thought would take decades to push through. President Obama has already indicated his support for eliminating the crack and cocaine sentencing disparity that metes out mandatory prison time to poor black people while letting whites go with a slap on the wrist for basically the same offenses. We triumphed this year in overturning the draconian Rockefeller drug laws in New York, which for 35 years forced long mandatory prison terms on first-time nonviolent drug offenders, most of them blacks and Latinos. This month we are celebrating our Centennial Convention in New York, our birthplace. Like the dreams of the past that many insisted were beyond reach, the struggle to right our nation's criminal justice wrongs is a bold vision. For the sake of our sons and daughters in the next 100 years, we cannot rest until this dream is embraced and won. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Todd Jealous.","NAACP Pres. Benjamin Jealous: Wants daughter to be able to marry black man .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- As the trial surrounding Michael Jackson's death gets underway, Las Vegas is about to make a revelation of its own: A Michael Jackson slot machine, to be unveiled next week. It's just a coincidence that the release of the Michael Jackson King of Pop slot game on Tuesday is occurring along with the trial of the performer's physician, Conrad Murray, who's charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, said a spokesman for Bally Technologies. The Los Angeles trial, exposing stark details of Jackson's last moments, began this past week. With iconic images of his sequined glove and dancing shoes, the Jackson slot machine exemplifies state-of-the-art gaming, with a surround-sound chair that even vibrates to the pop legend's music, the manufacturer said. The machine also has four high-definition screens for wagering and displaying his videos such as ""Beat It."" A University of Nevada Las Vegas gaming analyst who reviewed the machine Friday predicted it is ""going to be a popular game for a lot of people"" -- though it is ""unfortunate"" that the game is being unveiled during the manslaughter trial, the analyst said. Another expert on Vegas gaming noted how slot machines are programmed to guarantee a return for casinos. ""Slot machines generally speaking are the most profitable for the casino, and they are the most cynical in their design,"" said Marc Cooper, an associate journalism professor at the University of Southern California and author of ""The Last Honest Place in America: Paradise and Perdition in the New Las Vegas."" ""That the manufacturers of these machines would extend the cynicism from math to popular icons should not be surprising to anybody,"" Cooper said. The Jackson game is being introduced Tuesday at the Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas. Bally plans to show 150 games in total, with the Jackson slot machine among its top features, the firm said. Bally executives said Saturday that the timing was accidental. ""We started the process about a year ago,"" said Mike Mitchell, vice president of game design at Bally, adding that's when the firm negotiated the licensing of Jackson's music and videos with several parties, including Jackson's family and estate. The game will be in casinos by early 2012, he said. Added Bally spokesman Mike Trask, referring to the manslaughter trial: ""It's a sad story for everybody. No matter what you think of Michael Jackson and what you think of everything going on, there's no question that he was an amazing entertainer and he was an icon of American pop culture. It's going to be a fun and thrilling game that millions of players are going to enjoy playing all over the world."" The game emphasizes an immersion experience in which players sit in a chair with Jackson's music piped into speakers behind the headrest, and the tunes are intensified with subwoofers and thumpers, said Bally video game designer David Schultz. The music list is composed of six songs: ""Billie Jean,"" ""Beat It,"" ""Smooth Criminal,"" ""Bad,"" ""Dirty Diana"" and ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,"" according to Bally. The game is designed so that during bonus rounds, Jackson's sequin glove shows the player where to touch the screen to spin a gaming wheel, designed like an album, to try to win a credit, Bally spokesmen said. A celebrating Jackson also moonwalks across the screen and gives the player wild symbols, spokesmen said. The game targets people who grew up to MTV and recall Jackson's original videos, Bally executives said. ""These were groundbreakers, and they still hold up,"" said Bally game producer Chris Guerrero about the Jackson videos. ""It's amazing to watch them each and every time."" Said Trask: ""The person who was 18 when 'Beat It' came out is now 40 and now has more discretionary income and is excited about this game."" The minimum bet is 40 cents, with a maximum of $4, Bally officials said. Because the game will be networked with other Jackson machines across Nevada -- a so-called wide-area progressive game -- the jackpots will start at $750,000 and extend into the millions, Bally officials said. Mitchell deemed the game a ""blockbuster."" ""We think the Michael Jackson brand, along with the energy and entertainment value, combined with the jackpot, will give us a huge hit,"" Mitchell said. David G. Schwartz, director of the center for gaming research at University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said the game is being rolled out just as the global audiences are watching the televised manslaughter trial and learning the stark circumstances of Jackson's death. Jackson died at age 50 in 2009 of an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, in combination with sedatives. ""It's kind of unfortunate because there's people talking about the last hours of Jackson's life,"" said Schwartz, ""but I don't think there's too much they can do about the timing of it because of the expo next week."" Schwartz tested the game Friday at Bally's invitation, he said. ""I've never seen anything that integrates that kind of video content right into the game,"" Schwartz said. ""It's just a fun game because you basically got Michael Jackson, the music and the dancing that is part of the game. That's why I think it's going to be a popular game for a lot of people. ""It has an 'immersive' aspect that is coming out in a lot of games now,"" said Schwartz, who reviews gambling trends for Las Vegas publications and on his blog and dgschwartz.com website.","Bally Technologies Inc. will unveil next week Michael Jackson King of Pop game .

"(CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday. The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. Information gleaned from them will be given to the FBI, she said. Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit. Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon. The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot. ""Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio,"" the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. ""When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried. Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon."" It was not immediately known whether the alleged remarks are audible on the voice recorder. But federal regulations state that planes manufactured since 1991 must record cockpit chatter on microphones. The JetBlue plane was new and would be subject to the rule. The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours. About 3Â½ hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant. He then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom. By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states. From the cabin, Osbon tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit ""and he banged on the door hard enough that the FO thought he was coming through the door,"" according to the affidavit. But the door held and, over the PA, the first officer ordered passengers to restrain Osbon. Several did just that, subduing the pilot in the forward galley. Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement. He has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment, the airline said Wednesday. A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday. JetBlue has repeatedly praised the first officer, along with an off-duty captain who stepped in to assist and other crew members. Some passengers have referred to the first officer as a hero. But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label. ""Knowing my son, he would think that he's not a hero. He just did what he was paid to do,"" Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd. ""That's just his job, and he loves his job. He's just a quiet man."" He called his parents the night of the incident, his mother said. ""He was pretty shaken up, and he couldn't say much."" The incident took place on a significant date for the family -- the 10th anniversary of the death of Jason Dowd's older sister, who died of cancer, Jean Dowd said. ""I know he was thinking of her, too, at the time this was all going on,"" Dowd said. The incident ""has been earthshaking for us, too,"" she said. ""To lose him would have been terrible for us."" Jason Dowd, 41, who is married and has two young children, has not made a public statement. He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said. After the incident, the flight made the emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times. ""He loved to fly, a love which he got from his dad,"" Judy Osbon said in a statement. ""He also took his piloting very seriously and was very good at it. I've only known Clayton to be a cheerful, conscientious and caring person."" Her stepson was upbeat the last time they spoke, she said. Osbon's father, Ronald, who was a pilot, and a passenger were killed in a 1995 airplane crash in Florida, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot radioed he was losing power on both engines and was out of gas. The aircraft crashed near Daytona Beach Regional Airport. CNN's Aaron Cooper, Mike M. Ahlers and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of flight's captain .

"(CNN) -- Contrary to the Hollywood image in movies like ""Minority Report,"" technology hasn't served law enforcement particularly well over the years. Fragmented and complex operating systems have challenged police officers to manually enter information into multiple programs. And yet officers still struggle to retrieve the information they need -- especially in the field, where it can be a matter of life or death. A large number of law enforcement agencies are still hindered by antiquated technologies. But agencies that have upgraded their operating and investigative systems have been tremendously effective in ensuring the safety of their citizens. Police forces like the Guardia Civil in Spain and An Garda Siochana in Ireland were early technology adopters and now benefit from some of the most efficient police operations and investigative systems in the world. These are the police forces of the future -- the ones that others will be modeling themselves after in the years to come. Accenture recently studied police forces from around the world and found that in every region, police are hungry for new technology. They see tech such as analytics, biometrics (identification of humans by their characteristics or traits) and facial recognition as keys to effectively fighting crime and maximizing the time officers spend in the field. Despite the reality of reduced budgets, law enforcement agencies that adopt new technologies can prevent crimes more effectively and solve crimes faster. ACLU raises privacy concerns about police technology tracking drivers . Video analytics . What many people don't know is that there's a solid infrastructure of closed-circuit TV in most cities. Historically, these CCTV cameras -- both publicly and privately owned -- have been used retrospectively to examine crime scenes for evidence. Images from street cameras along the Boston Marathon route helped identify the two bombing suspects there last April. In California, the San Diego Trolley Corporation now safeguards light-rail passengers with a video-analytics system that can alert security guards when it spots suspicious behaviors, such as an unmarked vehicle in a pedestrian zone. Cities such as London and Singapore also are testing pilot programs to apply predictive analytics to video feeds. Singapore's government and economic leaders recently launched a one-year ""Safe City"" pilot program to bring automated analytics to existing CCTV infrastructure across the city. The program will apply predictive analytics to video feeds to detect which of a multitude of street incidents, such as crowd and traffic movements, pose real concerns for public safety. These video feeds also will identify environmental threats to public safety, such as fire or flooding, as they arise. When a serious incident is identified, an alert will be sent to the authorities. This program enables real-time information sharing and will give law enforcement deeper insight into public safety across Singapore's densely populated urban landscape. It also will increase police ability to anticipate and respond to incidents as they occur. Police embracing tech that predicts crimes . Data mining and predictive analytics . Other cities are using statistical analysis and predictive modeling to identify crime trends and highlight ""hidden"" connections between disparate events. This helps police gain a more complete picture of crime, predict patterns of future criminal behavior and identify the key causal factors of crime in their area. Police in Richmond, Virginia, adopted an advanced data-mining and predictive-analytics program in 2006 in an ambitious campaign to reduce crime. In the first year of use, the city's homicide rate dropped 32%, rapes declined 19%, robberies fell 3% and aggravated assaults dropped by 17%. Police in Memphis, Tennessee, also applied predictive analytics -- which relies on data-analysis software to predict where crimes will likely take place -- and saw immediate results. Serious crime in that city fell 30% between 2006 and 2010. Such technology also has been hailed for helping to lower crime rates in Los Angeles since its introduction by the LAPD in 2011. And Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, uses an analytics model that brings together location-based crime and traffic-crash data to develop effective methods for deploying law enforcement and other resources. Using geo-mapping to identify ""hot spots"" -- areas with high rates of crimes and car accidents -- the parish saw the number of fatal drunk-driving crashes fall from 27 in 2008 to 11 in 2009, with a corresponding increase in drunk-driving arrests. Biometrics and beyond . Next on the horizon of law-enforcement technologies is biometrics, including facial recognition. The same software that has been used to identify high rollers and cheats in casinos, for example, can now be used to single out people banned from football stadiums or terrorists on a watch list at key border-control points. Similar biometrics, including iris recognition, are now used to match passengers to their digital images on e-passports at border crossings all over the world, something that was unthinkable a decade ago. While not all police investigations resemble ""CSI"" today, the potential for technology to reduce crime is real and proven. Although reduced budgets are making it harder for some police forces to adopt new tech tools, all law enforcement agencies must prepare their officers to embrace new technologies as they become available. Our future safety depends on it. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ger Daly.","Police forces around the world are fighting crime with new data-mining tools .

"(CNN) -- Read this article in Spanish on CNN en EspaÃ±ol . Hispanic teens are more likely to use illicit drugs such as marijuana, ecstasy and cocaine, compared with their African-American and Caucasian counterparts, according to a new study. The study was released this month by the Partnership at Drug Free organization. It says that 54% of Hispanic teens reported having used an illicit drug, followed by African-American teens at 45%. Caucasians came third at 43%. Why? There is no definitive answer, but there are contributing factors involved, according to William Raikes, assistant director of consumer research at The Partnership at Drugfree.org. A larger percentage -- 62% of Hispanic teens -- have been offered drugs such as ecstasy, crack/cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine at least once, compared with 53% of Caucasian teens and 46% of African-Americans. When it came to Hispanic parents, 21% said they were OK if their teen ""smoked marijuana sometimes,"" compared with 11% of African-American parents and 6% of Caucasian parents. ""Parental permissiveness is another factor we document as being linked to teen substance abuse. Hispanic parents appear to have some misconceptions regarding prescription drug misuse and abuse,"" Raikes said. ""Both of these factors could have an influence on a child's substance abuse."" Some of these factors are well-documented predictors of substance abuse, such as a teen's perceived risks and social disapproval, according to the study. ""Perceived risks"" weigh how risky a certain behavior -- such as substance abuse -- appears to a teen. ""Social disapproval"" measures a teen's approval of his or her peers' substance abuse. Both of these measures have been shown to precipitate actual substance abuse. Hispanic parents reported the highest rates of problems establishing rules that prohibit drug use. However, Hispanics adolescents received less punishment for their drug use, the report states. Hispanic parents are just as likely as others to have conversations with their children about the risks of addiction. The disparity between drug use and warnings are because the talks are focused on trying to prevent the abuse of these substances by their children and not on prevention, according to the study. Hispanic teens are more likely to encounter substance abuse in their daily lives. Specifically, having access to substances, to have friends who abuse substances, and to have been offered substances. This could influence a teen to perceive substance abuse as a normal behavior, increasing their chances to engage in the dangerous activity. This trend is occurring throughout the country, not one geographic area that is more susceptible to substance abuse than others. Although certain drugs have a tendency to be more prevalent in certain areas -- for instance marijuana is more prevalent on the West coast than in the Midwest. ""Hispanic teen substance abuse however, is a national trend and Hispanic parents throughout the country should heed the call and talk to their kids,"" Raikes said.","Hispanic teens are more likely than African-Americans, Caucasians to use illicit drugs .

"(CNN) -- Each year Yi Jiefeng does what she can to stop China turning into a desert. For the last 12 years the native of Shanghai has planted saplings in Inner Mongolia trying to reforest the region, but also to keep the memory of her dead son alive. In 2000, Yi's only son was killed in a traffic accident in Japan. Yi almost succumbed to grief, but instead decided to devote her life to living out her son's dream of planting trees in the deserts of Inner Mongolia. ""He was fond of nature since he was a little boy,"" Yi said of her son, Yang Ruizhe. ""He was concerned about natural things such as wind, rain, plants, and animals."" Through the non-profit organization Green Life, the project has changed from being a tribute to her child to a campaign to raise awareness of the land degradation that is rapidly turning China's grasslands into barren plains. After the tragic accident Yi used the insurance money from Ruizhe's death -- 30 million Japanese yen -- to set up Green Life in 2003. It wasn't easy at first, said Yi, but in the past 11 years the group has planted more than one million trees. ""In the beginning, I did this charity as a mother who wanted to realize her son's dream,"" said Yi. ""But later I realized that China has a really serious desertification problem ... If the situation keeps getting worse, how can 1.3 billion Chinese people possibly survive? So we felt a sense of social responsibility. "" Read more: Bringing smiles to tsunami survivors . Almost a quarter of China, an enormous 2.6 million square kilometers across 18 provinces, is classified as desert. In the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia alone, sandy plains accounts for an area greater than the size of Germany. Overgrazing, population growth, logging and droughts are largely responsible, according to researchers. One of the biggest challenges for Yi has been fundraising. She and her husband have invested most of their life's savings in the project and sold two houses to keep the initiative going. ""Because we have limited funds, we can only afford a small operation team while there is a lot to do,"" said Yi. ""I'm 66 years old now. But I have only an average of three to four hours of sleep every day. Sometimes I don't even have this amount of sleep. It's all for saving money for the project."" Yi and her husband began their endeavor with little knowledge of agriculture and their first planting season was not a success: rainfall that year was less than 200mm and the saplings were blown over by strong winds and the shifting sands. But after seeking help from local forestry specialists in the second year many saplings took root in the harsh landscape. ""It seemed that my son's spirits bestowed good fortune on us -- it rained heavily when we finished,"" said Yi. ""Ever since, we would go and plant trees every year, and it rained every time. This made the survival rate stay above 85% even till now."" Since 2008, there has been an increase in volunteers and donors, which Yi says gives her and her husband strength and enables the project to keep running. Among them are a number of parents who lost their own children, including one mother who lost her college-aged daughter to cancer, and another mother whose son committed suicide. ""It is easy to break a chopstick, but they become unbreakable when we put all of them together,"" said Yi. ""Everyone on the planet has his or her own weaknesses, but with one complementing the other, we will eventually get a big force. Environmental problems especially need this kind of power from people with benevolence.""

"(CNN) -- There are a lot of things in my freezer. Animal sperm isn't one of them. Though, to be fair, I've never actually checked the full ingredients of a Klondike Bar. And now I have concerns. There's a polar bear on the packaging. I admit that it's an irrational new fear, but it all stems from several popular online reports this week about Japanese scientists at Kyoto University creating a very specific sperm bank for endangered species using new innovations in freeze-drying. But, while my freezer probably doesn't contain any animal sperm, soon we might be seeing science freezers that do. Science freezers, of course, being the technical description for freezers that hold ... science. ""Steve, reach in there and grab me a vial of science."" Working with the city's zoo, Japanese researchers at Kyoto University have now successfully freeze-dried sperm from chimps, a slow loris, and a giraffe. And when it comes time to bring the little swimmers back to life, they simply have to let them thaw out in water. Like you would a frozen chicken cutlet. But, in this case, a chunk of sperm. I say 'chunk' because I assume they come in bricks, and if you had enough of them you could build a decent backyard Sperm-gloo in the winter. You have your uses for frozen sperm. I have mine. Chunks or not, the way this technology actually works is that it uses a specially developed preservative which allows the frozen future animal to be stored at a relatively high temperature that's actually just above freezing. Really, then, this new way of doing things doesn't even require a freezer at all. You can literally put it next to your leftovers in the fridge. Though, drunkenly grabbing the wrong Tupperware in the middle of the night could prove disastrous. ""Leftover fettuccini alfredo? Don't mind if I do!"" The current alternative is liquid nitrogen. But that requires lots of equipment and significantly more energy. Thus, lead professor, Takehito Kaneko, has been working on this new method for over a decade, developing a way to incorporate the special buffer preservative within the freeze-drying process, all while maintaining both the sperm and its genetic information for decades at a time. You know, to create a vintage market. (Pro Tip: 2013 was a good year for walrus.) And now that Kaneko and his fellow scientists seem to have this system down, they're gearing up an endangered species sperm bank so that we can more efficiently confuse and aggravate an already pissed-off planet. ""Look, y'all, I'm tired of giant pandas. Get these weirdos off of me!"" ""Shut up, Earth. They make good web videos."" But never mind this tragic little home in the solar system, the Kyoto scientists are even thinking about colonizing other planets with some of our rarest species. Because, you know, what Mars really needs is a lemur. You're welcome. Professor Kaneko has only experimented with animals, and admits that he's unaware of any human application for this technology. But that's probably a good thing. Because when we do finally decide to create a whole new ecosystem in space, it's probably far better off with turtles and sloths. Humans would just stand around twerking giant space rocks and Instagramming it back to everyone waiting on the mothership. Because then -- and only then -- will we know the Red Planet is officially ours. At least I'm pretty sure that's how we'll claim everything in the future. ""Welcome to CarMax. I see you like the silver Honda."" Now, as Kaneko's endangered animal sperm bank moves forward, he's keen to get his hands on a bunch of larger animals that are at risk. Like elephants and tigers and rhinos. The zoo has 132 different species for him to choose from, so that's a lot of de-sperminizing. And it's only half the battle -- the next step in the process is figuring out a way to use this new technology to freeze-dry the female's eggs as well. So, who knows when we'll eventually get to beam our weirdest little creatures into the cosmos. But when we do, I assure you it will be delightfully unnecessary. You're welcome.

"Wuhan, China (CNN) -- Professor Kou Zhangbing conducts a health check. He tenderly calls the patient over with a tap of his hand, checks tongue and teeth for injuries, eyes for mood, and skin for scratches. As a treat, he hands out a salted fish. ""The most important thing we can do is to keep them healthy,"" he says. Kou is one of a handful of Chinese scientists trying to save the finless porpoise, a freshwater species found in the Yangtze River. Rarer than China's giant panda, this famed species now teeters on the brink of extinction. Recent surveys suggest that there are a mere thousand animals left, down dramatically from similar surveys conducted just six years ago. ""If proper measures aren't taken they will be extinct in 10 years, but to be honest, we only have five years to take action,"" said Zhang Xinqiao of the World Wildlife Fund. Professor Kou and his colleagues research the rare mammal in a series of deep blue pools at the Institute for Hydrobiology in Wuhan. They are trying to understand these curious creatures and possibly breed them for the wild. ""I spend more time with them than with my family,"" said Kou, ""They have become an indispensable part of my life."" It's mating season, so they dance underwater and act a little strange. Occasionally, a porpoise swims right up to the viewing glass and all but presses its face against it. The porpoise's face is set in a permanent quizzical smile. Dark and forward-facing eyes carefully monitor the movements of its visitors. Porpoises are smaller and stouter than their dolphin cousins; they have shorter beaks, and live in smaller groups. Those groups could be getting even smaller in the wild. Asia's longest river is also one of its most polluted. Scientists estimate that about 800 million tons of wastewater is dumped into the Yangtze every year. Pollution, overfishing, and intensive development on the Yangtze have all combined to push the porpoise near extinction. ""All of these human activities have destroyed the natural habitat of the finless porpoise, taking away their food supply and even injuring and killing them directly,"" said Zhang. He said the prospect of survival in the Yangtze is bleak, but he clings onto hope for the species. That hope, such as there is, can be found West of Wuhan in Tian-e-Zhou oxbow lake. Once part of the Yangtze, the lake was formed from a bend in the river and then separated from the main stream. ""This is the best chance we have to keep the species alive,"" said Gao Daobin, an official in charge of the park. ""We only have this animal in China and kids will start asking questions when they learn about it. They will ask 'why did it go extinct?'"" It's no idle fear. The Baiji dolphin, a regal animal with its trademark pointed beak, went functionally extinct in the Yangtze in 2006. Scientists believe there may be individual animals in the murky water, but it could never sustain the species. So the finless porpoise is the last remaining freshwater cetacean left in China. Gao shows us a breeding pen separated from the lake by just a net. A handler drops individual fish into the mouth of the captive porpoises. They have to make sure to give exactly the right nutrients. They will be released into the lake, where the fewer than 40 porpoises could represent their last stand. ""Nobody cared about them in the past, but attitudes are changing. Now, if they go extinct, all of our years of work will be meaningless,"" said Gao.","Researchers in China are working to protect the finless porpoise from extinction .

"(CNN) -- A song featuring pop star Rihanna was dropped this week from the ""Thursday Night Football"" pregame show to make time for discussion of the Ray Rice domestic violence incident, a spokesman for the NFL Network said. Alex Riethmiller said the 2009 Jay Z song ""Run This Town,"" which features Rihanna, will return to the broadcast next week. The chairman of CBS Sports, which will simulcast the game, told Sports Illustrated that the broadcasters weren't overreacting to the scandal over the NFL's reaction to the Rice incident. ""We thought ... we needed to have the appropriate tone and coverage,"" Sean McManus said. ""A lot of the production elements we wanted in the show are being eliminated because of time or tone."" Timeline of key events in the Ray Rice story . Rihanna was the victim of domestic violence in February 2009 when she was assaulted by her then-boyfriend, Chris Brown. Some critics questioned the appropriateness of the song being a part of the telecast for a game involving the Baltimore Ravens. Opinion: Why does she stay? That's the wrong question . The Ravens on Monday cut Rice after video of the running back punching his now-wife was posted by the website TMZ Sports. After beating Rihanna with his fists, Brown entered a guilty plea to one felony count of assault and was sentenced to probation, counseling and community service. Rice was admitted into a pretrial intervention program in New Jersey that involves counseling. If he successfully completes one year in the program, the felony charge of assault will be wiped from his record. Jay Z won two Grammy Awards for ""Run This Town.""

"(CNN) -- Ligwina Hananto wakes up at 5am for morning prayers with her family, gets the kids off to school, and then charges off to work on the several other jobs she is actually paid to do. ""Most people only have dreams and dreams are goals without a deadline, without any action. So that doesn't work, if you want to dream something, you dream big and then you make it into a goal and so you set a deadline, when you want to have it and how you want to achieve it, and then you start working on it,"" Hananto said. She doesn't just dream big, she executes and that is exactly what she advises her clients at QM Financial to do. In her late 20's Hananto went from being a stay at home mom to running her own company that now boasts hundreds of clients. ""It took time and after thirteen clients I ran out of cousins to contact! So I said to my partners at that time, 'we need to expand to different areas here,'"" said Hananto. She ended up marching down to a local radio station in Jakarta and throwing out an idea. ""I said to them, 'I want this to be an honest radio talk show [host]; if one company wants to sell their products and if I think that product sucks, I get to say it on air.' And they loved it; they were like, 'Oh like Suzie Ormond?' 'Yes, yes, like Suzie Ormond but with the hijab,' I said."" Hananto is a practicing Muslim and one of Indonesia's young movers and shakers. She says when her traditional Muslim husband wanted her to stay at home and be a mother and housewife, she agreed. With the pressure of having to make money off her shoulders Hananto said it gave her the ability to dream and try out different businesses. She tried seven different business, all failed. Then she found her passion by remembering what she loved doing when she was in school. ""Actually when I was in high school, I actually wrote down when I grow up I wanted to become a businesswoman who works with people's money. I didn't even know that there's a profession as a financial planner,"" she said. The Indonesian government is banking on people like Hananto. Indonesia is betting on its young minds to help its economy boom in the coming years. Half of Indonesia's population is under 29-years-old. ""We call this the 'demographic dividend', which I think will put us in good shape to have productivity increases for the next ten, fifteen, even 20 years in the future,"" Marie Pangestu, Indonesia's Trade Minister, told CNN. Donny Pramono fits into that demographic. At 26-years-old he capitalized on something he thought was missing from Indonesia's marketplace. ""They didn't really believe yogurt was going to be a big hit,"" Pramono said. Investors didn't believe then but they do now. In two and a half years, Pramono's ""Sour Sally"" brand yogurt has gone from one store to 26 in Indonesia and it's about to go international opening its first store in Singapore in December. But there are still hurdles for Indonesia's young people. About 14 percent of the population still lives below the country's poverty line and poverty is most concentrated among those with little or no formal education. Pangestu warns the education system needs to be improved to give its up-and-comers the tools to compete. As for young CEO's Hananto and Pramono they brought back business know how from universities abroad and have been experiencing the taste of success ever since. ""Because I started young and I'm still young I think success is not just a destination for me,"" Pramono said. ""Success is a journey, and so it's never ending.""","Around half of Indonesia's population is under 29 .

"(CNN) -- The table was set with an unhealthy serving of his favorite foods: fried chicken, baked beans and an extra-large helping of macaroni and cheese. For some people, alcohol and cigarettes are unhealthy vices. For Ben Boukari Jr., food was his addiction. ""To me, food was like a best friend after a long day at work,"" Boukari wrote in his CNN iReport. It was September 2010. At 6-foot-3-inches, Boukari weighed 379 pounds. His waist was 52 inches around and he was already outgrowing his 3XL shirts. He had always been overweight, a trait that earned him the nickname ""Big Ben"" from his friends in grade school. He likes to say he had a ""signifi-can't"" weight problem. ""I would tell myself I'm going to enjoy eating this weekend, but come Monday, I will make my lifestyle change. I must have made myself this promise hundreds of times."" Just a few months earlier, at 26, Boukari had been the youngest official ever elected to the Alachua City Commission in Florida. He was serious about his promise to serve his community, but he somehow couldn't keep the promises he had made to himself. That afternoon, while Boukari sat eating his usual oversized lunch at his older brother Bryan's office, his brother looked at him and served up some tough love. ""How can you take care of people's business if you can't take care of yourself?"" Bryan remembers saying. He worried that his younger brother's political accomplishments would be overshadowed by his obesity. His words made Boukari think about how others perceived him. ""No one wants to be overweight,"" Boukari said. ""I didn't want the public to see me like that. ... That very moment has changed my life."" The commitment . Boukari decided he would keep his promises this time, and the next day began his journey toward a healthier future. He started by dramatically changing his eating habits, switching to a diet low in carbohydrates and limiting himself to smaller portions. He cut out sugar and consumed just 20 carbs per day, primarily eating vegetables and meat. On a typical day, he had boiled eggs for breakfast, a grilled chicken salad for lunch, and a steak with vegetables for dinner. Boukari also made it a point to avoid stepping on a scale. He knew his weight loss would be a slow journey and refused to be discouraged by a number. ""The first three months were the hardest,"" he said. ""You've got to believe it's going to work."" That belief helped Boukari push past what he called the ""wall."" Before he knew it, sticking to the diet was natural. Despite having a sweet tooth, Boukari said he never ""cheated"" and he means never -- Boukari refused to eat his own birthday cake for two years. ""You will have friends that will say you deserve a cheat day. No you don't,"" he said. ""You cheat when you have reached your absolute goal."" After nine months of hard work and extreme discipline, Boukari decided to step on the scale in June 2011. He had lost 90 pounds. ""I was ecstatic,"" he said, surprised that he weighed less than 300 pounds, a number he hadn't seen since his freshman year of high school. The weight loss gave him a boost in confidence and a sense of achievement he hadn't felt since being elected city commissioner. The plateau . But after a few more months of dieting, the scale barely budged. It was time for him to switch things up. When a friend invited Boukari to work out with him in October 2011, he decided to integrate exercise into his routine, knowing that he couldn't quit if he had a partner who expected him to show up. ""When I make a promise, I keep it. Telling him I would be there locked me into going."" Boukari honored his promise and four days a week, he and his friend got together at the local high school's track to exercise. The high intensity routine was brutal at first. They were doing 50 yards of lunges, 50 yards of backpedals, sprinting for 50 yards and power walking one mile around the track to help him reach his target heart rate. Up to that point in his life, Boukari hadn't even managed a single push-up. The second win . To stay motivated, he turned the compliments from his friends, family and peers into fuel -- fuel to get him through his tough workouts, to curb his cravings and to keep the promise he made to himself to lose the weight and keep it off for good. ""Every single day since 2011, someone has made a comment regarding my weight loss. That person had no way of knowing at the time, but it was this positive encouragement that kept me going,"" he said. After just one month, his hard work and diligence started to pay off. In November 2011, Boukari did his first push-up. ""My body was changing and the weight was just coming off."" He stuck with his new exercise regimen and by May 2012, Boukari had lost another 50 pounds. He was down to 234 pounds, had dropped 14 inches off his waist, and tossed out his 3XL shirts to make room for his new size: large. In order to satisfy his sweet tooth, Boukari has become the master of finding alternatives that satiate his cravings without compromising his progress. A piece of sugar-free candy, a low-carb dessert or diet soda is enough to do the trick. To compensate for these treats, he increases physical activity and keeps the portions extra small. The city commissioner takes pride in his new self-image, acknowledging that the weight loss has made him care more about himself. These days, his weight fluctuates by 10 or 15 pounds -- today he weighs about 250 -- and he says he would like to lose another 25 to 30 pounds. After that, he expects to work on maintaining his weight loss the rest of his life. ""We are all very proud of Ben for putting his mind to this goal and continuing to achieve it every day,"" said Boukari's older brother Bryan. ""He's still Big Ben, but he's just big in a different way now; he's got a big personality.""","Ben Boukari loses 145 pounds with a strict low-carb diet .

"Beijing (CNN) -- I was at the last public speech by the former U.S. ambassador to China Gary Locke. During the Q & A session, a Chinese student asked the outgoing ambassador to compare the Chinese dream and the American dream. The ambassador said he didn't know much about the Chinese dream, so he talked instead about the American dream. Like Americans, the Chinese people also have their dreams -- a powerful country, a good education, a happy family, or a bountiful harvest. Yet the dreams of the ordinary Chinese have never been articulated as powerfully and eloquently as the American dream, until Xi Jinping came into power. OPINION: China's awkward 'banana' slip . Xi first mentioned the term ""the Chinese dream"" during his tour of an exhibit at the National Museum of China in November 2012, shortly after he became leader of the Chinese Communist Party. That exhibit is called the Road to National Rejuvenation, and Xi said the Chinese dream is the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Then on March 17, 2013, Xi fully spelled out his thoughts about the Chinese dream in his first public speech as the newly elected president of China. ""The Chinese dream is the dream of the whole nation, as well as of every individual,"" he said. ""The Chinese dream, after all, is the dream of the people. We must realize it by closely depending on the people, and we must incessantly bring benefits to the people."" Publicity campaign . After his speech, the Chinese dream has entered the daily discourse of both the Chinese government and the ordinary Chinese, thanks in no small part to the government's massive publicity campaign. There were countless speeches, contests, essay competitions, scholarly conferences, and TV shows that had the Chinese dream as the central theme. If there had been a contest for the most popular Chinese phrase in 2013, the Chinese dreams would probably have won the title. Apart from nationwide publicity, there are other reasons why the Chinese dream has become a household phrase. It is much less elusive than Mao Zedong's Thoughts, Deng Xiaoping's Theories, Jiang Zemin's Three Represents, or Hu Jintao's Harmonious Society; it is a term that can be understood by any Chinese. Besides, who doesn't have dreams? Thus it easily resonates with the Chinese people. Finally, Xi promised to realize the dream by depending more on the people and bringing more benefits to them. Thus Xi's dream, at least in its rhetorical form, is a dream for the people, by the people, and of the people. Who doesn't like such a dream? Reforms . And Xi meant what he said, at least in one area and that is corruption, the most urgent issue facing the Chinese community party. He has launched an unprecedented crackdown on corruption, and 20 high-ranking officials -- vice-minister level and above -- have been investigated or punished within a little more than year. He also signed two documents -- Eight Regulations and Six Bans -- that have significantly improved bureaucratic efficiency and sharply reduced public expenses on receptions, overseas travel, and vehicle purchases. Because of Xi's tough campaign, China's entertainment businesses, particularly top-end restaurants, clubs, and hotels, have suffered enormous losses, over which the ordinary Chinese are rightfully gloating. Rampant corruption, be it bribery, buying and selling offices, illegal land grabs, or abuse of power, is certainly the biggest scourge of China today, leading to rising discontent and unrest as well as declining public trust in government. Most importantly, corruption seems to have made it increasingly difficult for the ordinary Chinese to have their dreams come true. Restoring confidence . China is becoming economically and militarily much more powerful, and the average Chinese is living a much better life. Yet at the same time more and more Chinese seem to have lost faith in the government and the future of China. A prosperous and powerful China should be a land of opportunities for its people, but actually it appears to have become a land of anger and despair for an increasing number of Chinese. Thus Xi's articulation of the Chinese dream and his campaign against corruption can be viewed as the first steps by the new Chinese leadership to restore public confidence in the party and the government. Thus far, his policies have won enthusiastic support among most Chinese, and Xi has become arguably the most popular leader since Deng Xiaoping. If the dreams of the ordinary Chinese today -- like those of their ancestors in ancient China -- depend on the good luck of having a sage leader, however, that means China is still under the rule of man, not rule of law. When that leader steps down, or if that leader makes disastrous decisions, the dreams of the Chinese people will be in jeopardy. With immense popular support at the moment, President Xi should initiate institutional reforms that empower every Chinese to have dreams and to have those dreams come true. These reforms will not only set China on a path of sustainable political and economic development, but also enable the Chinese people to be truly proud of the Chinese dream, just as Americans are proud of the American dream. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tao Xie.","March 14 marks one year since Xi Jinping was officially appointed China's president .

"(CNN) -- Stephen Prothero, a Boston University religion scholar and author of ""The American Bible: How Our Words Unite, Divide, and Define a Nation,"" is a regular CNN Belief Blog contributor. As President Barack Obama puts the finishing touches on his second inaugural address, one in which aides say Obama will take a ""hopeful"" tone, here are Prothero's picks for the top five U.S. presidential inaugural addresses: . 1. Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural (1801) If you think partisan politics are bad today, you should have seen the election of 1800. Desperately trying to hold onto power, Federalists accused Jefferson of all sorts of infidelities to God and country, blasting him as an infidel and intimating that he might be a secret Jew or Muslim. Soon each side was questioning whether America could survive rule by the opposing party. The election ended in a tie between Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr. (At the time, the Electoral College cast its ballots without distinguishing between president and vice president, and the two Republicans each got 73 electoral votes, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives.) It took 36 ballots before the House awarded Jefferson the presidency. Into this maelstrom, Jefferson delivered perhaps the most conciliatory inaugural address in U.S. history, ""better liked by our own party than his own,"" in the words of Massachusetts Federalist George Cabot. ""Let us then, fellow citizens, unite with one heart and one mind, let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things,"" he said in a classic expression of our great tradition of conciliation. ""Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. ... We are all Republicans. We are all Federalists."" Bibles, oaths and parades: Inaugural trivia . 2. Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural (1865) The Gettysburg Address is the greatest speech by America's greatest orator, but Lincoln's second inaugural contains some of his most profound thinking. In this address, which according to Frederick Douglass ""sounded more like a sermon than a state paper,"" Lincoln thinks out loud about the ways and means of Providence in the midst of the bloodletting of the Civil War. A lesser man might have denounced the Confederates as evildoers, or called God to his side. Instead Lincoln coolly observed the battleground where theology and the military meet: ""Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. ... The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes."" After this astounding flight of theological humility, Lincoln ended his remarks with another great statement of conciliation, urging his fellow Americans, North and South, to act ""with malice toward none, with charity for all."" Good advice, that, for civil wars and culture wars alike. Quiz: How well do you know your inauguration history? 3. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first inaugural (1933) Like Jefferson and Lincoln, FDR delivered his first inaugural address in a moment of crisis, though this time the crisis was economic rather than political or military. In an era before food stamps and Social Security, the Great Depression had put two out of every five Americans out of work. Farm prices were collapsing. Factories were closing. The banking system was convulsing. The stock market was crashing. Into this grim situation FDR delivered hope. ""This is a national consecration,"" he began, and then got right to the point: ""So, first of all, let me assert my belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance."" Strictly speaking, this sentiment makes no sense. Fear itself aside, there is always plenty to fear. But Roosevelt struck the right chord for the moment, and his reassuring words paved the way for the massive overhaul of the federal government now known as the New Deal. 10 inaugural moments that mattered . 4. John F. Kennedy's inaugural address (1961) John F. Kennedy's first and only inaugural was a Cold War speech that barely mentioned domestic policy. It takes us back to a time when the lines between liberals and conservatives were harder to draw -- when an upstart Massachusetts Democrat like Kennedy could run to the right of the sitting Republican president and war hero Dwight D. Eisenhower on foreign policy. It also recalls an era when presidents would actually call for sacrifice. Today politicians tell us what our country can do for us, or they demand that our country leave us alone. Kennedy told us to put the interests of the nation above region, party, and even self. ""Ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country,"" he said, in a line that inspired a generation to enter into the newly formed Peace Corps and other forms of public service. In a less known but equally apropos line he said, ""Civility is not a sign of weakness. ... Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us."" 5. Ronald Reagan's first inaugural (1981) Ronald Reagan's first inaugural address isn't on its own terms a classic. But it was historic in the sense that FDR's first inaugural was historic. While FDR paved the way for the New Deal, Reagan set the groundwork for its gradual dismantling. Ironically, FDR was Reagan's hero. But here Reagan turned on the big government FDR had ushered in, giving the policies of his predecessor a clear rebuke. ""In this present crisis,"" he said, ""government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem."" Reagan's first inauguration came on the same day that 52 American hostages were released from Iran. So the celebrations were particularly keen. But in retrospect the day was most important for ushering in the Reagan Revolution and the fears of big government and high taxes that continue to haunt us today.","In the wake of election tie, Thomas Jefferson delivered most conciliatory address .
Frederick Douglass said Lincoln's second inaugural ""sounded more like a sermon""
Franklin Roosevelt's first inaugural delivered hope amid the Great Depression ."
"(CNN) -- An HIV-positive German pop singer went on trial on Monday accused of failing to tell sexual partners about her condition, causing one of them to become infected. Nadja Benaissa, 28, former singer in the girl band No Angels, is charged with causing grevious bodily harm and attempted bodily harm, a court spokesman told CNN. Benaissa had unprotected sex on five occasions between 2000 and 2004 with three people and did not tell them she was infected, Agence France-Presse reported the charge sheet as saying. She had allegedly known her status since 1999. Benaissa admitted not telling sexual partners she was HIV-positive but denied intending to infect anyone, according to AFP. ""I am sorry from the heart,"" she told the court, according to media reports. One of the three men Benaissa allegedly slept with has since been confirmed as having HIV, prosecutors told an earlier hearing, AFP reported. German newspaper Bild reported that Benaissa's attorney read a statement in which she said she believed there was little chance of her passing on the virus and did not want it made public because of the harm it might cause her daughter and the band. Bild also reported that one of Benaissa's alleged victims told the court he had unprotected sex with Benaissa on about three occasions. He said he went to the doctor after learning of Benaissa's condition from her aunt, and discovered he had contracted the virus. He told Benaissa: ""You have borne so much suffering in the world,"" according to the newspaper. No Angels became Germany's most successful all-female group after being formed on the international television show ""Popstars"" in 2000. The band reformed in 2007 and competed in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. Benaissa is appearing in youth court because she was 17 at the time of the first alleged offence. The fact that Benaissa was HIV-positive was not made public until her arrest in April last year, AFP reported. She spent 10 days in custody after her arrest before being released on bail. The trial is expected to last five days and hear from witnesses including fellow members of No Angels.","Pop singer Nadja Benaissa allegedly infected one partner with HIV .

"London, England (CNN) -- Lionel Messi's form with Barcelona has been sensational again this season, scoring 34 league goals to help the club retain the Spanish title, but the burning question is whether he can reproduce that on the biggest stage. Messi, the 2009 FIFA world player of the year, has been hailed as the natural successor to Argentina legend Diego Maradona, who is now his national coach. He played in all 18 of Argentina's World Cup qualifiers but netted just four times as La Albiceleste struggled to reach South Africa by snatching South America's fourth and final automatic place in the last round. Some critics have questioned whether Maradona is capable of getting the best out of Messi, but the 23-year-old told CNN's Pedro Pinto that the two have a close relationship. ""The truth is that Maradona has always been very nice to me, even before he was our coach and I took my first steps as a professional,"" Messi said. ""Now that I have him as a coach, he's even more close and he gives me a lot more of his confidence than he did before."" Is Messi better than Maradona? The comparisons with Maradona have been inevitable, especially after Messi's stunning goal against Getafe that evoked memories of his sometime mentor's solo effort against England 24 years ago. ""He's a legend in Argentina, everyone from a young age knows who Diego Armando Maradona is. At first, it was strange to have him as our coach. The truth is he was a little imposing. ""But afterwards, we started getting used to him and he's been our coach for a while, so now it's normal. Also, he's really close to the players, he's one of the guys, so there's no problem."" He wears the No. 10 shirt made famous by Maradona, who won the World Cup for Argentina as captain in 1986 with a series of dazzling displays in Mexico. ""It's very special for me to wear the shirt of the national team. I think it's a beautiful responsibility to be playing with this shirt, especially with such a football-crazy country watching everything we do. It's something very beautiful,"" he said. Maradona has had well-documented troubles with drugs and his party lifestyle, even being kicked out of the 1994 World Cup, but Messi maintains a much lower profile off the pitch. ""I've always had my family really close by, and my friends,"" he said. ""The truth is that I've never been one to go out much, to go out partying. I've never had those problems because, yeah, my family has always helped me out with that."" The Rosario-born forward said that he is hoping to make the World Cup ""mine"" despite the weight of expectations on his shoulders. ""I pray. Hopefully, it will be my World Cup, Argentina's World Cup and that we hit the ground running and play up to peoples' expectations and win the World Cup,"" Messi said. Who will be the World Cup's best player? Messi acknowledges that Barcelona's free-flowing style under coach Pep Guardiola gives him more chance to shine than with Argentina, where he has a different role. ""They are different systems and different styles and everything, no? At Barcelona, Guardiola decided to use me more in midfield and that's when I had more touches on the ball and played more around the front of the area. And well, I've had the luck to be able to score more goals,"" he said. ""People have an opinion and I respect it. I'm the first person who wants to do well with my national team and perform like I do with Barcelona. I know that this is a really good opportunity for me and I'm going to try to do it."" Messi insists he feels no extra pressure going into the World Cup, with Argentina's first Group B match against Nigeria on June 12, as the intense media cauldron in Spain has prepared him well. ""I already live with constant pressure to play well, to win titles and, as a result, I don't worry about pressure,"" he said. ""I do believe that Argentina isn't Messi alone. It's a group where everyone is going to keep moving forward. ""Once I step onto the pitch, I try to concentrate and get myself into the game. Sometimes, it's hard, but I try to stay focused when I step onto the pitch."" Who will win the World Cup? Argentina are not among the favorites after struggling to impress under Maradona, and Messi admits that European champions Spain, five-time World Cup winners Brazil and 1966 titleholders England are the teams to beat. ""I think that right now, the strongest sides going into the World Cup are Spain, England and Brazil. They had a strong, easy qualifying and are very tough,"" he said. ""But you have to show up in the World Cup, and in the World Cup anything can happen.""","Lionel Messi tells CNN he is determined to live up to high expectations in South Africa .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- An unscripted, shocking moment during last year's MTV Video Music awards dominated Sunday night's show, with Kanye West and Taylor Swift putting their feelings to music. Lady Gaga, who carried home eight MTV trophies, ensured she would not be overlooked with frequent costume changes, including one with a raw beef hat, dress and handbag. An animal rights group said it would ""likely be crawling in maggots."" Taylor Swift sang a ballad of forgiveness for West -- the rapper who interrupted her acceptance speech at last year's show, while West's song seemed to acknowledge his reputation as a jerk. ""Who you are is not what you did,"" Swift sang. ""You're still an innocent."" ""Let's have a toast for the scumbags,"" West sang in the hook to his song. It was the only line in the hook that was not too expletive-laden to be reprinted. Swift, who has built a career writing songs about men who have done her wrong, penned her song -- ""Innocent"" -- earlier this year ""about her feelings about last year's VMAs,"" her representative told CNN. Her song was immediately available on iTunes and will be on her next album ""Speak Now."" There was no immediate information from West's representative about his song, which ended the show. West also was the target of jokes from show host Chelsea Handler. She lampooned the rapper by offering tips on how to fend off people stealing the spotlight. Another celeb made fun of her own bad behavior early in the show. Lindsay Lohan, fresh out of jail and rehab, appeared in a backstage skit with Handler, who was wearing an alcohol- . detection bracelet like the one Lohan recently wore. ""Wake up, Handler, pull it together,"" Lohan said as she slammed Handler against a wall. ""You're a menace. Do you think anyone will work with a drunk? Take it from me, they don't."" Handler made her first stage entrance wearing a model of a house on her head, a joke aimed at Lady Gaga, who is known for creative and often bulky costumes. Gaga's first costume included a feather Mohawk and a heavy hooped dress with a train. She wore it when accepting the best female video award. She struggled to reach the stage for her second award -- for best pop video -- because of her second dress, which she explained was ""too heavy to walk in."" Near the end of the show, when Gaga accepted the best video award, she was dressed in raw meat from head to toe, including her handbag. The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals issued a statement Monday saying someone should tell Lady Gaga that there ""are more people upset by butchery than impressed by it -- and that means a lot of young people will not be buying her records if she keeps it up."" ""Meat is the decomposing flesh of an abused animal who didn't want to die, and after time spent under the TV lights, it would smell like the rotting flesh that it is and likely be crawling in maggots -- not too attractive, really,"" PETA said. Eminem, who opened the show in a duet with Rihanna, won for best male video and best hip-hop video. Teen singing sensation Justin Bieber took the stage outside of the Nokia Theater in downtown Los Angeles during the first hour. He was surrounded by hundreds of screaming teen female fans, a scene familiar to Bieber. He was later given the best new artist award. ""Coming from a little town in Canada, I never thought I'd be in this position,"" Bieber said. ""Jersey Shore"" cast members provided humor from a hot tub. Handler jumped in the tub with the four, including Snooki and the Situation. Last year's show is remembered mostly for what was not planned. West, who walked the red carpet with a bottle of cognac in his hand, jumped on stage after Swift was announced the winner over Beyonce in one category. ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm gonna let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time,"" he said, snatching the microphone from Swift after she had won her award. Swift stood onstage, speechless, clutching her award. The cameras panned to a shocked Beyonce, while the audience booed and later chanted ""Taylor."" Though Beyonce later afforded the teen singer another opportunity to finish her speech, the West backlash had begun. It cost him his spot on a concert tour with Lady Gaga. Other MTV awards this year included: best rock video to 30 Seconds To Mars; best art direction to Florence + the Machine; best cinematography to Jay-Z and Alicia Keyes; best special effects to Muse; and breakthrough video to The Black Keys.","NEW: Lady Gaga dresses in raw meat to accept her last award .

"(CNN) -- Outdoor sporting goods retailer Bass Pro Shops is being sued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for allegedly engaging in a pattern of hiring discrimination against African-American and Hispanic job applicants, the EEOC said in a statement Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The EEOC alleges the discrimination has been ongoing since November 2005. EEOC Chairperson Jacqueline A. Berrien said the federal agency will protect the rights of job applicants, and that ""excluding qualified individuals from employment because of their race or ethnicity or in retaliation for exercising protected rights are fundamental violations."" The lawsuit alleges qualified applicants were denied positions such as cashiers, as well as for various management positions. It goes on to claim that managers in Louisiana and in the Houston area believed that ""hiring black candidates did not fit the corporate profile."" The EEOC also believes that managers at some stores retaliated against employees who were in opposition to the discriminatory practices and in some scenarios fired or forced employees to resign. Bass Pro Shops issued a statement denying the allegations and maintaining that the company had cooperated fully with an EEOC investigation. ""The EEOC's allegations are contrary to our profound respect for and commitment to our team of experienced and knowledgeable associates, and we are determined to prove them wrong,"" Mike Rowland, vice president for human resources, was quoted as saying in the statement. ""Fundamental fairness and good faith should require that the EEOC reveal the evidence on which its claims are based before filing a lawsuit that will be long, expensive and disruptive,"" Rowland said in the statement.","EEOC claims outdoors retailer discriminated against black, Hispanic job applicants .

"(Ars Technica) -- The white plastic MacBook is officially dead for good after Apple notified resellers that it will no longer be available to educational institutions. The 13-inch machine was essentially killed off for most of the public last July, but the budget laptop continued to be available to schools for the last six months. Now, however, the machine has officially been EOL'd (End of Lifed), bringing the old iBook legacy to an end once and for all. As noted by MacRumors, Apple informed resellers of the product EOL on Wednesday, saying they had ended the educational distribution channel for the machine. It's unlikely that Apple has been actively manufacturing white MacBooks up to this point, either -- it's not public how long the company did manufacture it (if at all) past last July, but its cancellation this week was likely due to the end of whatever remaining supply was available. When Apple made the white MacBook unavailable to the public last year, it was on the same day the company introduced its 11-inch MacBook Air for $999 -- the same price the as the MacBook. Apple doesn't typically like to sell Macs for much cheaper than that for extended periods of time, so it was only a matter of time before the white MacBook bid the world farewell.

"(CNN) -- Actor Ed Begley Jr., best known for his roles in ""St. Elsewhere,"" ""The West Wing,"" and ""Best in Show"" (he's also twice appeared on ""The Simpsons""), is the star of ""Living with Ed."" It's a reality show that follows him and his wife Rachelle Carson, as they attempt to live the green life on the outskirts of LA, while competing to out-eco neighbor Bill Nye. Begley has been a committed environmentalist for decades and is the author of ""Living Like Ed: A Guide to the Eco-Friendly Life."" CNN asked him what it takes to ""live like Ed"" and his take on the current state of environmentalism. CNN: What do you hope to achieve with ""Living with Ed""? Begley: To engage viewers with entertainment, then give them a ""take-away"" or two every show that will save them money and help the environment. CNN: When did you ""go green"", and why? Begley: I did it because my father, Ed Begley, Sr. was a conservative that liked to conserve. We always lived in a modest home. We turned off the lights, turned off the water, saved string, tin-foil, we threw precious little away. So, by the time Earth Day came around in 1970, I was primed and ready to take some additional steps, and do more. It's worth noting that my father died a few days before the first Earth Day, so I did it to honor him, as much as anything else. CNN: The show has been very successful -- have you been surprised by the level of interest? Begley: Yes. I've tried other ""green"" shows in the past. None of them worked. I credit ""Living With Ed"" success to the addition of my wife to the mix. CNN: Right now it seems like environmentalists are losing ground to climate change deniers over global warming, with the email scandal at the University of East Anglia. Some polls show less people believe the science than a year ago. Do you ever get despondent? What gives you hope? Begley: I find it a bit unsettling that the deniers are winning, for now. But, I think more people will understand our role in climate change over time. I just hope it's not too late. CNN: Do you think one of the problems is that people feel overwhelmed -- both with fear for the future and the level of effort required to think about the moral, ethical dimension of all their consumer choices? If so, how can we move beyond this? Begley: It's human nature to resist change. We did with our efforts to combat smog in the early 1970s. But finally people realized that we wouldn't go broke cleaning up the air, if we did it right. They soon became aware that there were jobs making catalytic converters, combined-cycle gas turbines, spray-paint booths and cleaner fuels. We need to remind folks of our success in improving air quality and how similar clean-tech industries can spur the economy again today. CNN: If you could ask CNN readers to do one thing, what would it be? Begley: Get out of your car as much as you can. Ride a bike, if weather and fitness permit. Take public transportation, if it's available near you. CNN: Do you think we should stop eating meat? Begley: I stopped eating meat in 1970, and I'm a very healthy 60-year old man. It can be good for our health, and the health of the planet. CNN: In the end, do you think making personal changes to our lifestyle will be enough? Or do we need a lead from government? Begley: Personal action is one important component [but] Government and industry must also do their fair share. CNN: Do you think that any big environmental legislation is likely in the U.S., given the scale of opposition? Begley: Sadly, there will be no strong environmental laws passed anytime soon, as the extractive industries have been successful at convincing folks that we can't afford them. To give another prospective, [I'll not] only quote an oil man but the name of T. Boone Pickens who said, ""We can't drill our way out of this problem"". CNN: If you had the chance to whisper some advice in President Obama's ear, what would it be? Begley: Be true to the environmental ethic that you forged in the Senate. Do what's right, and great good will come of it; hopefully, sooner, rather than later. CNN: Do you have a message for climate change skeptics? Begley: Let's agree to disagree. Let's pursue fiscally sound green technology for the following reasons: to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, to clean up the air in our cities, to put money in our pockets. And if you do it right, you just bought an insurance policy to protect you against climate change, if the many scientists who believe in it are correct. CNN: Arguably, we are moving into politically uncharted territory now, and the scale of the global co-operation required to deal with global warming, biodiversity loss and the other environmental problems we face is unprecedented in human history. Do you think we can do it? Begley: Yes. But, we must act now. Tomorrow is too late.","Actor Ed Begley Jr has been a life-long environmentalist .

"New York (CNN) -- The editor of Essence Magazine defended Wednesday her recent hiring of a white fashion director -- a first for the 40-year-old publication that celebrates black women. The hiring of Elliana Placas first sparked outrage when a former Essence employee posted a note on her Facebook page decrying the decision. ""It's with a heavy heart I've learned Essence Magazine has engaged a white Fashion Director,"" former Essence staffer Michaela Angela Davis wrote. ""I love Essence and I love fashion. I hate this news and this feeling. It hurts, literally."" Essence editor-in-chief Angela Burt-Murray wrote in an opinion piece posted Wednesday on African-American news site theGrio.com that Placas initially joined the magazine six months ago to run the fashion section on a freelance basis before being hired permanently as fashion director. ""I got to see firsthand her creativity, her vision, the positive reader response to her work, and her enthusiasm and respect for the audience and our brand,"" Burt-Murray said. ""As such, I thought she'd make an excellent addition to our team. And I still do. This decision in no way diminishes my commitment to black women, our issues, our fights."" Critics of the decision raised concerns over the lack of African-American women in fashion as part of their outcry over the hiring of Placas. ""The fashion industry is not diverse -- it is an elite, closed world and there is very little place for black women,"" Davis told CNN. ""At Fashion Week, there was one seat for Essence. One. Black women's image and beauty has either been ignored or defiled and that one seat should be filled by someone who can represent the style, history and body type of black women."" Davis is adamant that she is not a racist, but instead concerned that a position where an African-American woman might be able to start and build her career has been lost. ""Essence was the first magazine that says in their brand that it is for black women and their motto when I worked there was 'where black women come first,'"" Davis told CNN on Wednesday. ""This is not about being racist, this is about wanting a place where black women can grow and flourish and go out and help diversify,"" she said. Burt-Murray said in her opinion piece that she shared concerns ""about the lack of visibility of African-American women throughout the ranks of the fashion industry, which is overwhelmingly white."" ""I, too, want to see more of us on the mastheads of all the magazines, seated in the front rows of the shows, designing our own fashion lines, and contributing our special flavor and flyness to the world of style,"" she wrote. Burt-Murray also wrote that she has seen strong reactions in the past from readers when it comes to matters of race and the magazine. Recent examples of reader outrage included a profile of rapper P. Diddy and his longtime girlfriend Kim Porter, which some readers found promoted having children out of wedlock and a negative image of black couples, and guest columnist Jill Scott voicing her opinion about black men who date outside of their race, which some readers felt was reverse racism. Likewise, the decision to hire Placas has not escaped scrutiny. However, despite the outrage, Davis insists that readers not drop their support of the magazine yet, writing in a second Facebook post, ""We need Essence today as we did 40 years ago. I don't believe this is the time for a boycott."" Burt-Murray noted that past issues that should have sparked such outrage were often overlooked. She cites several in-depth reports the magazine conducted on issues plaguing the African-American community, including black children falling through the cracks in under-performing schools, the increase in sex trafficking of young black girls in urban communities, inequities in the health care services for black women or how HIV is the leading cause of death for black women ages 18-34. ""The things that really are the end of our world apparently aren't,"" she wrote. ""While the response to these important stories may not always be as strong as we would like or lead to immediate change, Essence remains committed to telling these stories. ""Forty years ago Essence was founded to empower, celebrate, and inspire black women to climb higher, go further and break down barriers. Our commitment to black women remains unchanged as we continue to stay laser-focused on those principles -- no matter who works with us."" Davis said she feels readers should still support Essence, but says there's no reason why the magazine should be immune to criticism. ""I hate that I'm even having this conversation because I love Essence -- it was my home,"" Davis said. ""But I spoke out for all the black girls who called me crying because what does this say to them?"" Meanwhile, Burt-Murray is standing by her decision to hire Placas. ""We remain committed to celebrating the unique beauty and style of African-American women in Essence magazine and online at Essence.com,"" she wrote. CNN's Julie Cannold contributed to this report.","The editor calls Elliana Placas ""an excellent addition to our team""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate on Thursday handed President Bush his first veto override -- authorizing $23 billion in new water projects. The Army Corps of Engineers works on levee improvements in New Orleans, Louisiana. The vote was 79-14. Approval by two-thirds of the Senate, 67 members, was required for passage. Bush spiked the measure Friday despite its overwhelming bipartisan support, calling it too costly and complaining that the 900 projects it authorized would overtax the Army Corps of Engineers. But the House of Representatives passed it again Tuesday on a 361-54 vote -- well beyond the two-thirds margin needed for an override -- and the White House said it was resigned to seeing the bill become law.   See a chart of recent and historical vetoes » . Supporters said the projects authorized under the Water Resources Development Act are necessary to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, restore the Everglades and Great Lakes fisheries and build flood-control projects nationwide. They said it has been more than seven years since Congress passed a major water resources bill. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a Democrat from California who was responsible for shepherding the bill through the Senate, said the Senate was sending the president a message. ""You should respect the Senate, the House, the Congress and American people because we are elected, too,"" Boxer said.  ""We are close to the people. We know what their needs are."" Florida Sens. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Mel Martinez, a Republican, said they also decided to vote to override the veto, noting that the bill authorizes nearly $2 billion for Florida projects, most of it related to the Everglades.  Watch Senate override Bush's veto » . ""It's time for us to save one of the great natural wonders of the world,"" Nelson said at a news conference. Before Thursday's vote, two senators from states hard-hit by Hurricane Katrina -- a Republican and a Democrat -- urged their peers to override the veto. ""This is about flood protection, this is about water and sewer projects, it is about doing something about water and the proper salinity in the Gulf of Mexico. ""These are good, deserved, justified projects that should go forward,"" said Sen. Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, whose home in Pascagoula was wiped out by the storm. ""A quarter of the state probably wouldn't even exist if we didn't have flood control projects,"" Lott said. Nearly every president has had trouble with water resource programs, and Bush was ""just trying to hold the line on spending."" Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said the bill has overwhelming support from both sides. Landrieu said the bill will lay a foundation for reconstruction after the storm, which killed more than 1,800 people in Louisiana and Mississippi. The measure will fund projects including the reconstruction of levees around New Orleans, Louisiana, and closing off the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet -- a manmade channel blamed for funneling Katrina's storm surge into the city's Lower 9th Ward and neighboring St. Bernard Parish. In his veto message, Bush complained that Congress added about $8 billion in projects to the bill in committee after each house had passed its own version. ""American taxpayers should not be asked to support a pork-barrel system of federal authorization and funding where a project's merit is an afterthought,"" he said. In a statement issued after Thursday's vote, the White House said,""No one is surprised that this veto was overridden."" But, White House spokeswoman Emily Lawrimore said in the statement, ""It's obvious that the bill doesn't make difficult choices and doesn't set spending priorities. We don't believe it's a responsible way to budget."" Bush's veto of the water projects bill was the fifth veto of his presidency. All of those came in his second term, according to Senate data. Bush has vetoed fewer bills than any president since James A. Garfield, who issued no vetoes during his seven months in office in 1881. Congress unsuccessfully attempted to override three of the president's previous four vetoes. E-mail to a friend .","Senate negates veto of bill that helps Gulf Coast, Everglades, Great Lakes .

"(CNN) -- Taking time out to eat a homemade chocolate cake is hardly the conventional way to win an ultra-endurance marathon, but don't tell Emelie Forsberg. Her quirky and offbeat approach -- she competes sporting a hair band adorned with flowers -- has proved a breath of fresh air in the male-dominated sport of Skyrunning, where she has become world and European champion. Fleet of foot, she makes light work of massive mountains such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn -- running with a permanent smile etched across her face -- because for Forsberg this truly is a labor of love. ""It's my biggest passion, you create a relationship with nature, "" the Swede tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I love to be in the mountains because it gives me a feeling of freedom and what is real."" Worryingly for her rivals, Forsberg admits that the other reason for her cheery disposition is that she also has plenty of room for improvement. ""I'm smiling because I'm so happy to get to do what I love the most,"" she says. ""And also because I'm very bad in pushing myself over the limit. I'm always pretty comfortable, I don't want to suffer! I can remember only one or two races when I was really hurting."" And the flowers in her hair? ""In Sweden we only have them for two months, so it's always nice to have beauty around you,"" the 27-year-old explains. ""It's just a nice thing to have in the hair, it's a nice touch."" Forsberg is also aware that the majority of the competitors in Skyrunning mountain races are men and she likes to strike a feminine chord. But her appearance and friendly disposition belie a fiercely competitive instinct, and she has not only been dominating the women's competitions but also regularly placing in the top 10 against all opposition. Forsberg's other major passion is baking, stemming from her time as a chalet girl at a ski resort. Her personal website is a mixture of running anecdotes and ""recipes from a mountain lover"" for her favorite treats such as cinnamon cakes and apple pie. She tries out her efforts on her boyfriend Kilian Jornet, who just happens to be the the dominant male competitor on the world Skyrunning circuit with a string of big race victories and records. ""I love sweet things and my boyfriend loves sweet things, so it's a win/win situation,"" she says. ""I can bake as much as I want and I know what's inside and how good it is and only with good ingredients."" Back in 2010, on her way to her first victory in a mountain marathon, Forsberg naturally thought it would be a good idea to take a treat with her on the way. She spent 20 minutes at the summit to chomp through that chocolate cake before continuing to the finish. Her undoubted talent drew her to the attention of professional Skyrunning outfit Team Salomon, although Forsberg admits she had little knowledge of the discipline and the existence of a circuit. ""I got an invitation to Team Salomon (in 2012) to join them for a training camp and I was like, 'Yeah! I'll try that,' "" she recalls. ""I got to realize that Skyrunning is a very big sport here in Europe and it's actually bigger than cross-country skiing is in Sweden and for me, cross-country skiing is really big."" An almost overnight success, Forsberg now lives with Jornet in the French ski resort of Chamonix, under the shadow of the imposing Mont Blanc, the perfect training ground for the sport's golden couple. And for Forsberg, her idea of a perfect day is most people's idea of purgatory: an eight-hour run on mountain trails at high altitude. She spends up to an average of six hours per day, week on week preparing for her heavy racing program. ""I wore out seven pairs of shoes last summer,"" she reveals. Skyrunning has three main disciplines: a vertical race, which is entirely uphill; a standard event held over between 20-40 km, involving an ascent and descent; and the blue riband ""ultra"" held mostly over 80 km. Forsberg excels at all the distances and is now tackling longer races -- her biggest challenge being a 30-hour-plus 170 km test, during which even she admitted she had doubts about finishing as the going got particularly tough. Her love of natural surroundings became engrained from an upbringing on a rugged coastal region in eastern Sweden, with her family home surrounded by ""hilly terrain and wild forests."" There was not much time spent watching television or sitting by a computer and, with her grandparents on her mother's side from Lapland, she spent a lot of time in the mountains as well. ""I have always been fascinated about mountains, the views and just the freedom you get there, and when I was finished high school I moved to the mountains and I just started to train there,"" Forsberg says. ""I went up to summits, I went climbing and so I started Skyrunning -- but I didn't know that I was doing it. I just did what I loved."" As a student, Forsberg gained a degree in biology, but her Masters deposition is on hold while she concentrates on training and racing professionally -- particularly given her recent successes. They have bought her widespread acclaim, but an incident in September 2013 served notice of the dangers of extreme sport and sparked some adverse publicity. She and Jornet were attempting to climb the Aiguille du Midi, a near 4,000m mountain in the Mont Blanc region, when they ran into trouble near the summit in rapidly deteriorating weather conditions. Dressed only in light jackets and wearing just running shoes, they were left trapped on a rock face in driving winds, snow and fog. Rather than taking more risks by rappelling (abseiling) back down the mountain while freezing cold, the pair decided to call out the local mountain rescue team and sit tight. With conditions too bad for a helicopter to operate, they had to wait seven long hours before receiving assistance. It was a salutary lesson of the power of nature. ""We underestimated the conditions,"" Forsberg wrote on her personal website. ""The stupid mistake was I did not take a lot of extra warm clothes."" ""We are people. We make mistakes and learn from them. But this is still the way I love to be in the mountains. Light and fast."" After the Skyrunning season finishes, the adventurous duo spend their winters competing in ski mountaineering races, which combine alpine and cross-country skiing -- Forsberg competed in the latter Olympic discipline growing up in Sweden -- and climbing selected peaks. ""I first tried it two years ago and I got really hooked and I've reached a pretty good level,"" she says. ""I can live from that during the winter and it's a really nice complement for Skyrunning as well."" For Forsberg's rivals there is yet more cold comfort in her future ambitions on the circuit. ""Each race I want to improve, each race I want to do again, but for sure I want to improve and I have so much more I can improve on, so this is my motivation."" With such distances to be covered, and over uneven terrain, to the uninitiated there appears to be the prospect of physical burnout, but Forsberg tells another story. ""I have never been injured despite racing almost every weekend. Skyrunning has less impact on your body than road running where the movement and impact is so repetitive."" The sport's governing body will be keeping its fingers crossed that Forsberg stays clear of mishaps and lays a trail for other young women to make their mark. Lauri Van Houten, the vice-president of the International Skyrunning Federation, summed up her appeal. ""I've rarely seen such unbounded love of the mountains in anyone,"" Van Houten told the UK's Guardian newspaper last year. It's a love that shows no sign of abating, and Forsberg is already setting herself new goals, longer races, scaling ever higher peaks as fast as possible. She is inspired by Jornet, a 26-year-old from the Catalonia region of Spain who has set a series of mind-boggling records. Last year, Jornet ran up and down the Matterhorn in just two hours 52 minutes, smashing the previous best time. Forsberg now also holds the women's records for routes on the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc and is particularly proud of her efforts. ""It's not all about the records but I really like to move fast in the mountains and then when you reach the record, it's 'Wow!' It's pretty amazing to be the woman who is fastest up and down on the mountains, for sure,"" she says. ""Racing wise, my first year Skyrunning I won the world championship, and last year I was the European champion in both long and short distance and second in the vertical, so it's a lot of titles but it's not only about the titles, it's about what you do to get there."" That ""journey"" to the top of such a challenging and at times dangerous sport involves long and lonely hours of preparation, but it appears Forsberg's very raison d'etre has been satisfied. ""It's my life, it's my passion, I love mountains."" It's as simple as that.","Emelie Forsberg is a world and European champion in Skyrunning .

"Washington (CNN) -- The danger of Islamic radicalization inside U.S. prisons ""remains real and present,"" said Rep. Peter King of New York, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. But during a Wednesday hearing on the subject, others said there are only a few cases in which prison radicalization has been linked to terrorism. ""Prisons have not served as a major source of jihad radicalization,"" according to Bert Useem, a Purdue University sociology professor. Useem said that since the September 11 attacks, 178 Muslim Americans have been prosecuted for terrorism or related charges, but there is evidence in only 12 cases that prison radicalization was a factor. ""If prisons were a major cause of jihadist radicalization, we would expect to see a lot of it, but we don't,"" Useem added. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, says that judging from the information he's seen, ""the risk of terrorism originating from Muslim converts in U.S. prisons is small."" Thompson and several other Democrats on the panel also complained that the King hearing focused only on Muslims in prisons and did not address other groups such as gangs and white supremacists. ""I actually believe that the focus on one particular group on the basis of race or religion can be deemed as racist and discriminatory,"" California Democrat Laura Richardson said, adding that members of other groups could pose threats as well. King blasted back that when Democrats were last in control of the House and his committee, they never brought up threats from some of the groups they were mentioning now. King also distinguished radical Muslims from other groups, saying Muslim radicals could be connected to terror groups overseas. Do King's hearings betray American values? Michael Downing, who heads the counterterrorism unit for the Los Angeles Police Department, told the committee he takes the threat of radicalization in prison very seriously and thinks ""we are on the front end"" of a growing problem. Downing and other witnesses called for an in-depth study of the problem and for standards on vetting prison chaplains and on reading materials and videos that prisoners are allowed. ""There's radical material inside the prison system still. Anwar al-Awlaki's material is inside the prison systems,"" Downing said in reference to the Yemeni-American cleric who U.S. officials contend is a key member of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. He is accused of involvement in the plot to blow up an airliner headed into Detroit in December 2009 and the 2010 plot involving explosives placed in copiers on planes headed for the United States. King cited a number of terrorism cases involving prison radicalization, including that of Michael Finton, who pleaded guilty in May to wanting to blow up a Springfield, Illinois, courthouse; James Cromitie, who was convicted in a plot to use surface-to-air missiles against a troop transport aircraft in New York and detonate explosive devices at a Jewish community center and a synagogue; and Jose Padilla, who was convicted in Miami in 2007 of providing material support to terrorism. Hearings recall my life in internment camp . Another case cited by King and the committee's witnesses involved Kevin James, who was serving time in a California prison where he formed a radical group called JIS and recruited a fellow prisoner named Levar Washington. When Washington was paroled, he recruited a couple of other men, and they plotted to attack a military recruiting station and a Jewish target. James was involved with the plot while he remained behind bars and was later convicted for his actions. Kevin Smith, a prosecutor on the James case, said James taught himself about Islam and because of his charisma was able to entice others to join his plot. Smith said the prison system was not able to interfere with James preaching about Islam to fellow prisoners. Perhaps the most emotional moment in the hearing came when Rep. Hansen Clarke, D-Michigan, talked about childhood friends who went to prison but were never able to get their lives back on track. Clarke said too many people go to prison when they should be treated for mental illness or drug use. ""We are spending too much money incarcerating young men, young black men whose lives can be saved,"" Clarke said. ""It's not about Islam. It's about the sentencing policy. It's about this prison system.""","Rep. Peter King cites ""real and present"" danger of radicalization of prisoners .

"(CNN) -- A prominent Iranian literary translator is missing, just weeks after being released from Tehran's notorious Evin Prison, a source close to him said Monday. The individual said Mohammad Soleimani Nia, 40, hasn't been seen since he responded to a call from authorities last Wednesday to retrieve personal belongings that had been confiscated. He was to pick up items, including his driver's license, computer and passport at an office near Evin Prison. The source gave this chronology of events leading up to his disappearance: . -- In late November 2011, Soleimani Nia was questioned by security and intelligence officers. Friends and family aren't sure of the motive behind that questioning, because phones are monitored in Iran and Soleimani Nia was tight-lipped about the experience, which resulted in his being barred from leaving the country. -- On January 10, officials called him to the Revolutionary Court. The court hears cases of smuggling, blaspheming, inciting violence or attempting the overthrow of the Iranian government. -- After arriving at court, Soleimani Nia was accompanied by security guards to the home he shares with his parents in Karaj, outside Tehran. The guards searched the house, seizing electronic devices and documents, and prohibited Soleimani Nia from speaking to his parents. -- Soleimani Nia was then detained on unknown charges, then released on bail in May. He was freed after agreeing to suspend a hunger strike after 28 days. During part of that time, he reportedly was held in solitary confinement in Evin Prison, notorious for its harsh conditions. This, the next chapter in Soleimani Nia's on going saga, has many people close to him deeply concerned. ""We don't even know if he made it (to the office near Evin Prison) or if he was just kidnapped as soon as he left the house,"" the source said. ""This is very disturbing. To this point, no authorities have taken responsibility regarding this and we don't know where he is."" Associates have previously described Soleimani Nia as being physically delicate. Firoozeh Dumas, an Iranian-American author whose best-selling book ""Funny in Farsi"" Soleimani Nia translated for the Iranian audience, described her friend as ""a very gentle soul"" and ""a model citizen, who loves his country, his family and culture."" ""Mohammad Soleimani Nia is also the most nonpolitical person I have ever met,"" Dumas said. ""He translated 'Funny in Farsi' simply because he wanted to share with his fellow Iranians a book that he had enjoyed in English,"" she said. Soleimani Nia also is considered a tech pioneer by his peers; he is credited for launching an Iranian social networking website comparable to LinkedIn called U24, a portal for Iranian professionals seeking jobs. ""Given the high unemployment rate, he should be celebrated for his desire to help the Iranian economy. If he lived in America, he would be called a nerd. In Iran, he's a prisoner,"" Dumas said. CNN tried calling the spokesman for the Iranian foreign minister but has yet to receive an official response regarding Soleimani Nia's case.","Mohammed Soleimani Nia hasn't been seen since Wednesday, a source says .

"(CNN) -- American fitness guru Jack LaLanne died Sunday afternoon at his home in Morro Bay, California, according to his long-time agent, Rick Hersh. He was 96. The cause, said Hersh, was respiratory failure due to pneumonia. LaLanne had been ill for the past week. His wife, Elaine, was at his side, along with his family and friends, Hersh said. No funeral arrangements were announced, but his agent said plans were being made. LaLanne spent decades talking about the healthful benefits of exercise and fitness. He opened his own health spa in California in 1936, years before the fitness craze swept the United States. LaLanne even designed the world's first leg-extension machine, along with several other pieces of fitness equipment now standard in the fitness industry. He was born in San Francisco on September 26, 1914. A self-confessed sugar- and junk-food addict as a child, he went on to study bodybuilding and weight-lifting by the time he was in his late teens. From the 1950s through the 1980s, LaLanne performed multiple feats of strength and endurance. His first such stunt was an underwater swim the length of the Golden Gate Bridge, loaded with 140 pounds of equipment, in 1954. He went on to stage many attention-getting events, including completing over a thousand pushups in a little over 20 minutes, and towing 65 boats filled with thousands of pounds of wood pulp in Japan. LaLanne had his own workout program, ""The Jack LaLanne Show."" First broadcast nationally in 1959, the show went on to run for three decades. In his later years, he was easily recognized because of late-night infomercials on on the benefits of juicing. He also made many appearances on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" and was a friend of the talk show host. ""There was no one like Jack LaLanne,"" King said Sunday night. ""He would go on forever ... a true guru. I guess Charles Atlas from the old comic books would be the predecessor for Jack LaLanne."" But it wasn't simply LaLanne's physical prowess that impressed King. ""Elderly people were encouraged by him because he just kept on going,"" King said, adding that modern fitness celebrities owe a debt of gratitude to the original impresario of exercise. LaLanne's wife of 51 years released a statement on her husband's passing: ""I have not only lost my husband and a great American icon, but the best friend and most loving partner anyone could ever hope for,"" Elaine said.

"STOCKHOLM, Sweden (CNN) -- I am sitting in a Stockholm hotel over a breakfast of meatballs, eggs, crisp bread covered with salty caviar paste, toast with a dollop of lingonberry jam and a cup of strong Swedish coffee. Life is good. Boats line up along the waterfront outside the five-star Grand Hotel in Stockholm, Sweden. But there is little time to linger. I have one day to explore Stockholm before catching a flight back to the United States, a bonus excursion squeezed in after a trip to another country in Europe. My plane landed at Stockholm-Arlanda Airport the day before under gray skies, a steady drizzle and a temperature hovering around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Not a promising start. It's late May, but the first walk around the city requires three layers of clothing and an umbrella. Thankfully, the sun reappears for my full day of sightseeing, and I get a taste of the long Scandinavian summer days, with sunrises bathing Stockholm in light before 4 a.m. and soft twilight hanging around until 11 p.m. this time of year. From my guidebook, I know that Stockholm is built on 14 islands that separate the Baltic Sea from Lake Mälaren, earning it the nickname ""Venice of the North."" Still, strolling around the pedestrian-friendly city is a surprise: You're never far away from a beautiful waterfront walkway or a bridge or the cries of seagulls, but walk along any busy street, and you feel the hustle and bustle of a thriving European capital.  See photos of the Old Town, the Royal Palace and other Stockholm sites » . The crowds include lots of blond and blue-eyed Swedes but also feature plenty of Middle Eastern, black and Asian faces. I start exploring Stockholm by heading to where it all began in the 13th century: Gamla Stan, the Old Town, ""one of the best preserved medieval city centers in the world,"" according to the Stockholm Visitors Board. Gamla Stan offers winding, cobblestoned streets full of cafes, restaurants and shops that sell everything from amber jewelry to mock Viking hats. The buildings are painted in striking yellows and oranges, while impossibly narrow side alleys tempt visitors with hidden galleries and private eateries. Always crowded with tourists and locals, it's a great place to people watch. The Old Town is also home to Kungliga Slottet, the 600-room Royal Palace and official residence of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. Crowds gather at noon to watch the elaborate changing of the guard ceremony, which features the Royal Guards in pointy helmets marching to the palace's courtyard accompanied by a military band on horseback trumpeting their arrival. Surprise excursion . To give my feet a break, I plan to take in the sights from the water by boarding one of Stockholm's many sightseeing boats, which ferry tourists to the most visited spots around the city. There are several operators to choose from, and most give you the option to either stay on board for an hour round-trip or ""hop on, hop off"" all day. Because I want to stop and visit the Vasamuseet, one of Stockholm's most popular museums, on the island of Djurgården, I choose the latter option, paying 100 kronor -- about $13 -- for my ticket. Suddenly, I'm in for an unintended adventure. A boat arrives at the appointed time, and everyone lines up at the dock, so I join them and hop on board. It's not until we're well on our way that someone starts to check tickets and points out that I'm on the wrong boat. Oops. Instead of heading toward the museum, we are en route to Stora Fjäderholmen, a charming little island in Stockholm's archipelago. Thankfully, it's only 25 minutes away, and the ferry turns right around for a return trip to the city. Lesson learned: Many boats dock at tourist spots in Stockholm, so be careful which one you board. From shipwreck to art . Once back from the surprise excursion, I am finally on my way to the Vasa Museum, home to the majestic warship Vasa, which capsized just after it sailed for the first time in 1628 and spent more than 300 years at the bottom of Stockholm's harbor. Salvaged in 1961, it prompted a restoration that's been called the largest jigsaw puzzle in the world. Magnificently ornate and seemingly ready to fire its cannons as it sits on display, the ship looks like something straight out of ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Outside the museum, an arts and crafts fair tempts visitors with fried herring sandwiches. The fish, prepared in a variety of ways, plays a big role in the Swedish diet. Marinated herring was a tasty part of the breakfast buffet at my hotel, offered in mustard or sour cream sauce. Grocery stores also stock a wide selection of pickled herring sold mostly under the label Abba, which might make you think the former Swedish pop group is branching out in a new direction but is actually made by a company founded in 1838. For a final stroll, I hop back on the boat, head to the city center and walk along Drottninggatan, a busy pedestrian-only street full of restaurants, shops and fashionable Stockholmers. It's finally time to linger.","Stockholm is built on 14 islands that separate the Baltic Sea from Lake Mälaren .

"(CNN) -- Throughout my career as a doctor I have traveled from the mountains of Yemen to its deserts. I have seen first hand what happens when children give birth to children. I have seen the tombstones of girls who died too young because they married too young. Yemen is one of only two countries in the world with no legislation on a minimum age of marriage. With a national dialogue underway to establish a new constitution, there is now a chance to establish a safe age of marriage, protecting young girls who are currently married off as young as 9 years old. As I advocate to end child marriage in Yemen, I always remember my best friend at school. We would talk about our future and what we wanted to be when we grew up. We had big aspirations, as young girls should. My friend was the smartest girl in our class. Everything felt possible. But when she was 13, she was told to leave school to prepare for her wedding. Her dreams ended. We were all so upset. I still remember her wedding day as we tried to support her. It was such a sad day for us all, a stark comparison for so many whose wedding day is remembered as the happiest of their lives. I was lucky. My parents did not want me to marry as a child. They were my firewall, protecting me from the pressure of all the people in my community who said I should marry. They were determined to give me a brighter future. As I carried on my studies, and became a doctor, the image of my friend's wedding always stayed with me. So many girls in my country don't have the right to say ""No, I don't want that man or this kind of life."" My friend moved away and we didn't stay in touch. My friend's story is not unusual. The UN estimates that one in three girls in Yemen are married before 18. Around the world, approximately 14 million girls are married as children every year. The right to choose . To think of all the girls in my country who are forced into marriage, lose their personalities, their happiness and just have to obey what they are told to do, is what drives me forward in my work. Child brides don't talk about it, but they suffer. A recent study in Yemen has shown that girls who have their rights taken from them in this way do not forgive their parents, and there is a breakdown of family relationships. As a doctor I see the complications young girls are suffering from as they give birth before their bodies are ready. Girls not Brides, a civil society network campaigning against child marriage, suggests that girls under 15 are five times more likely to die giving birth. Read more: Yemeni girl goes on YouTube to plea for education, not marriage . Yemen has one of the highest maternal death rates in the world. According to the White Ribbon Alliance, one in 90 women die in childbirth in my country. I cannot bear to continue to watch young women giving up their lives and having to give birth too young. We must support our girls and women by providing better maternal health care, access to family planning and safe abortion. We must work together to end early marriage so that all girls have the right to choose when and whom to marry and are able to finish their education, strengthening the bonds that are so important to us, with our friends and our family. We know how to fix these problems. We can tackle many issues if we tackle early marriage. Together in partnership with the White Ribbon Alliance in Yemen and many other activists we have been campaigning for a safe age of marriage for many years. Since the uprising in 2011, a new constitution is being drafted in my country. This is an opportunity to establish a minimum age of marriage. But it is a narrow window of opportunity. Too often girls have no voice, no choice, no access. I am determined to help them have a better future. My friend did not fulfill her dream, but by ending child marriage together we can make sure that girls in Yemen and around the world can fulfill theirs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nawal Ba Abbad.","Campaigners in Yemen want law against child marriage in the country .

"(CNN) -- Night had fallen when the men heard the sounds on the mountain. First it was a chime, then a recitation of verses, followed by the crackle of wood burning. They scrambled to the summit to see what was happening. There, seated with his palms together and facing west, was their friend. Flames leapt around the peaceful man, engulfing him. It was just as he'd intended. The year was 527. This story of Daodu, a Buddhist monk, is told in James Benn's ""Burning for the Buddha: Self-Immolation in Chinese Buddhism."" Benn, an associate professor of religion at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, writes that the act of setting one's self on fire dates back in Chinese Buddhist tradition to the late fourth century. But no matter how old, self-immolation still leaves people horrified, riveted and moved. The popular uprising that led to the toppling of Tunisia's government began after Mohamed Bouazizi, an unemployed 26-year-old college graduate, ignited himself in protest and died earlier this month. Since then, a wave of self-immolations has rolled through North Africa, with other incidents in Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania. ""There's something so primal, so dramatic. ... It's meant to be noticed,"" said Carolyn Marvin, a professor who's specialized in freedom of expression at the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. It seems to ""demand some kind of reparation."" Though the history of self-immolation may run more than 1,500 years deep, the Western world woke up to it in the 1960s. The iconic June 1963 image of Thich Quang Duc, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk, surrounded by flames in a busy Saigon intersection was seared into Western consciousness. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhists by the South Vietnamese government, and his actions are often seen as having helped spark the regime's overthrow later that year. Others followed his example, not just in Vietnam but in the United States, too. In March 1965, an 82-year-old woman, Alice Herz, protested the ongoing Vietnam War by setting herself on fire on a Detroit, Michigan, street corner. Norman Morrison, 31, ignited himself eight months later outside the Pentagon, beneath the office window of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. The following week, Roger Allen LaPorte, 22, did the same in front of New York City's United Nations building. In other countries, too, self-immolations have played a part in political and social movements. There was Jan Palach, a 20-year-old student who in 1969 very publicly set himself on fire in Prague, Czechoslovakia, protesting Czech apathy five months after the Soviet occupation. Homa Darabi, a 54-year-old woman, did it in Iran in 1994 to demonstrate for women's rights after the Islamic Revolution. And a group of five burned together in 2001 at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, though three survived and the motivations are a matter of debate. See more images of provocative political protests . People have reportedly self-immolated in response to Communist regimes in Romania and Hungary, taxes in Sweden, the kidnapping of children by Chilean police. It's been done in Italy to protest the Catholic church's condemnation of homosexuality, in India to protest a film screening, and in the United Kingdom after an asylum claim was rejected. The list of locations, and reasons, goes on. But beyond political or social motivations, can faith inspire someone to burn themselves alive -- as it apparently did for Daodu in 527? Of the well-known U.S. cases, which represent a diversity of backgrounds, it's next to impossible to say. Herz, the 82-year-old Vietnam protester, was an immigrant of Jewish descent and had reportedly spent time in an internment camp during World War II. Morrison, who died outside the Pentagon, was a Quaker. LaPorte, who protested in flames in front of the United Nations, was a former seminary student and a member of the Catholic Worker Movement . In other cases, self-immolation has been more clearly linked to religious belief. Though outlawed in India for nearly two centuries, some Hindu communities practiced the ritual of sati -- in which a widowed Hindu woman would throw herself, or be thrown, on her husband's funeral pyre. In Buddhism, the subject of self-immolation is controversial, said Robert Sharf, the chair of the Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Many (Buddhist) schools strongly condemn suicide,"" he said, ""but at the same time, in East Asia, self-immolation has been practiced on and off for well over a thousand years."" Like most religions, he said, the canonical literature is so vast that, if you dig deep enough, you can find teachings to fit your needs. Enter the Lotus Sutra, considered one of the most significant Buddhist scriptures in East Asia. There's a small passage in one chapter that speaks of a Medicine King, one with great spiritual and moral wisdom. ""The Sutra tells us that as an offering to the Buddha and to display his insight that the body is not a permanent, unchanging self, he poured fragrant oil on himself and allowed himself to be burned by fire,"" wrote Buddhist monk, author, teacher and peace activist Thich Nhat Hanh is his book, ""Peaceful Action, Open Heart."" ""This is a quite radical demonstration of his freedom and insight, one that was made out of a very deep love,"" he wrote. And it was this part of the Lotus Sutra that Vietnamese monks and nuns pointed to when it came to self-immolation in the 1960s. But people don't burn themselves to death ""simply because the Lotus Sutra says to do it,"" emphasized UC Berkeley's Sharf. ""While it is an extreme and contentious practice, some Buddhists regard it as the ultimate form of self-sacrifice, justified in times of social crisis to bring about political transformation."" As for the recent self-immolations in North Africa, As'ad AbuKhalil said they are about sought-after change, not about religion. ""Western media still highly exaggerate the role and influence of Islam in political behavior and actions (and even violence by) Arabs and Muslims,"" said AbuKhalil, a political science professor at California State University, Stanislaus, and a blogger for a site called The Angry Arab News Service. ""The Tunisian uprising is clearly a secular event, and the Islamists have no role whatsoever in it. Not all actions by Arabs are derived by Islamic notions and principles."" He said there's ""no basis in Islam for self-immolations"" and that the practice came from ""Asian non-Muslim societies."" What's happening now ""reveals not an attempt to express oneself Islamically, so to speak, but to express oneself in an act that draws attention and sympathy and shows the outrage experienced by the oppressed Arab population."" Marvin, the Penn communications professor, echoed his sentiments. ""These young men represent a fairly dispossessed class,"" she said. ""It's as if they're offering up all that they have, their bodies, on behalf of the needs of their group."" Though the intentions of those who ignite themselves cannot always be known, some trends can be surmised -- especially when those who act don't succeed in dying. CNN's senior international correspondent Nic Robertson wrote in late November about a surge in female self-immolation cases in Herat, Afghanistan. ""They had set fire to themselves, so oppressed and desperate were they to escape abusive bad marriages,"" he wrote. The number of cases ""had doubled in the past year,"" a doctor told him. Some stories of self-immolations have become iconic. They, like the case of Bouazizi, seemed to galvanize others and force change. But not all do. In the United States, decades past Vietnam, at least two additional cases are thought to have been, at least in part, politically motivated, although the mental states of those who acted have been questioned. Malachi Ritscher, 52, lit himself on fire near a downtown Chicago, Illinois, expressway in 2006. The musician and activist was said to be protesting the war in Iraq, but he was also reportedly a recovering alcoholic who battled depression. Ten years before Ritscher set himself ablaze, a middle-aged woman did the same on Penn's campus in front of an outdoor sculpture of the peace symbol, Marvin said. She was Kathy Change. ""She was a very tall, willowy woman who would dance,"" across the campus,"" Marvin said. ""She left a suicide note. And the saddest part of it was she had this idea that if she burned herself it would stop everyone in their tracks, and everyone would be good to each other."" Paul Root Wolpe, the director of Emory University's Center of Ethics in Atlanta, Georgia, was a sociology professor at Penn at that time. In a letter he wrote to the student paper, The Daily Pennsylvanian, Wolpe -- who would later be asked to speak at Change's memorial service -- challenged students to not simply write her off as ""deranged."" ""She was the 'Dancing Lady' who often floated through campus waving a banner, spouting some vague references to love and political change. She was one of those characters who bring color to a college campus -- hard to ignore, but easy to dismiss -- and her final protest had the same character,"" he wrote. ""Let us, for a moment, give her the respect of taking her act seriously. What is it you would sacrifice your time and effort -- if not your life -- for?""","Self-immolations are in the news, after Tunisian's act spawns others in Africa .

"(CNN) -- You've probably seen it hundreds of times over this long holiday weekend: . You're driving down the highway or along a hometown street, and from the car in front of you someone heaves a pile of garbage out the window. Maybe it's the driver of the car, balling up fast-food wrappers and paper bags and tossing them high into the air as his car speeds merrily along. Or maybe it's someone on the passenger side, opening the window and lofting a soft-drink can or glass bottle somewhere in the direction of the side of the road, barely missing your hood. It's like an aerial barrage, everywhere around you, all the trash being thrown from all the cars onto all the roadways. ... What? You say you didn't see anything like that? You say you didn't observe a single person throw a single load of garbage from a car window? Right. Chances are, the scenario described above seems like a bad dream, something you didn't witness and would not want to. And therein lies a tale. There was a time in the United States when those piggish actions -- using highways and local roads as garbage dumps, reflexively throwing trash from car windows without considering there was anything wrong -- was quite commonplace. People did it because -- well, they did it because so many other people were doing it. Why did things change? Lost in all the recent coverage of the 50th anniversary of the death of President John F. Kennedy, and its ramifications for U.S. history, was a sidelight that, in retrospect, had a fairly remarkable effect on the way we live. When Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, moved into the White House at the end of 1963, they faced an almost impossible task. The nation was in mourning for the glamorous young president; suddenly Kennedy and his elegant wife, Jacqueline, were no longer living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and it was going to be tough for anyone to measure up. Johnson, a rough-hewn type from Texas, struck the country as the antithesis of Kennedy in terms of style and personal smoothness, and Lady Bird knew that neither she, nor anyone else, could replace Jackie Kennedy in the nation's affections. But what Lady Bird Johnson -- born Claudia Alta Taylor in rural eastern Texas in 1912 -- managed to do during her years as first lady has had admirable consequences that are felt even today. And one of those consequences was the garbage you didn't see being thrown out of car windows this holiday weekend, and the piles of trash you don't see building up by the sides of roads and highways every day of the year. Mrs. Johnson decided that she would use her position as the president's wife to push hard for improvements in what she thought was an area ignored in the public consciousness: highway beautification. Not that she especially liked that word ""beautification."" She thought that it made her projects seem a little trivial. Yet she firmly believed, as she once said, that ""Ugliness is so grim. A little beauty, something that is lovely, I think, can help create harmony, which will lessen tensions."" Much of her efforts centered on planting wildflowers along highways, and limiting roadside junkyards and garish billboards. She persuaded her husband to advocate legislative policies on behalf of her projects, and if there was one thing Lyndon Johnson knew how to do, it was get his way with legislation. The Highway Beautification Act, passed in 1965, was sometimes referred to as ""Lady Bird's bill."" A lasting benefit of her endeavors was Americans' realization that casually littering roadsides with garbage and refuse from cars was just not acceptable. The Highway Beautification Act did not outlaw littering on a federal level, but the impulse behind the legislation led to nationwide discussions about how to combat litter. ""Beauty belongs to all the people,"" President Johnson said at the signing ceremony, ""and so long as I am president, what has been divinely given to nature will not be taken recklessly away by man."" There had been ""don't-be-a-litterbug"" initiatives before Lady Bird Johnson moved into the White House, but having her as the voice of highway beautification, and having her regularly proclaim her support for the anti-littering efforts, made people pay attention. More than one child of the era, riding in a parent's station wagon, was -- in whimsical tones but with serious intent -- admonished, when he or she tossed wrappers out the window: ""Lady Bird wouldn't like that."" And more than one parent heard the same thing from his or her child, when the parent was the garbage-tossing offender. What is impressive is how dramatically habits have changed. Certainly there still is highway litter; adopt-a-highway and sponsor-a-highway programs have become well known ways to combat it, as have hefty fines. Ours is not exactly a polite, filled-with-constant-consideration-for-others society. Yet the kind of highway slobbishness that once was an unavoidable part of daily life -- the what's-the-big-deal hurling of trash from moving cars -- today carries a stigma that previously was lacking. Seeing a person throwing garbage from car windows now is kind of like seeing a person pulling out a cigarette on an airplane. It just comes across as immediately wrong. Lady Bird Johnson died in 2007. Although you don't hear her name much these days, she really did make a difference in the way her fellow Americans live. And she did it by opening people's eyes to what they should have been seeing all along. (Now, if some future first lady -- or first husband -- would only devote herself or himself to the issue of people texting and talking on phones as they drive. ...) The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene: There was a time when drivers threw garbage out the window without a thought .
That rarely happens now. Thank Lady Bird Johnson, who made highway beautification a cause .
He says LBJ pushed Highway Beautification Act; helped make people more aware of littering .
Greene: Lady Bird is unsung, but she helped stop behaviors that we wouldn't tolerate today ."
"(CNN) -- Brittni Garcia's family didn't go out for walks; they went out for dinner. And when they were at home, they enjoyed watching movies, playing board games and eating big Mexican-style home-cooked meals. This lazy lifestyle led Garcia to weigh more than 200 pounds by the eighth grade. ""My mom always said, 'You are a big girl. You are just big-boned,'"" said the 25-year-old information specialist. ""So I just accepted it."" Through high school and college, her weight continued to rise. But even at 235 pounds, Garcia didn't think her weight was a problem -- until she couldn't fit into her ""fat shorts"" anymore. That was December 2009. It was a typical night for Garcia. She was studying for finals in her sorority house at Eastern Illinois University and wanted to change into some comfortable clothing. She found her red pajama XXL shorts that she normally wore to bed. As she struggled to pull them up, she realized they were too tight and uncomfortable -- her ""big, comfy shorts"" no longer fit. ""Tons of emotions ran through my head,"" she said. ""I was afraid that was the way my life was going to be."" That's when Garcia's mentality changed. Being overweight was no longer normal for her. Heart disease runs in her family, and she realized it was time to address her weight now before it turned into a bigger health problem. ""I wanted to lose weight to challenge myself and show myself I can change, and not change for the world,"" Garcia wrote in her iReport. ""This time, it was for me."" Getting in shape wasn't going to be easy. Going to the gym had been one of her biggest fears for a long time. She was self-conscious about how she looked and sounded when she ran. ""It was hard for me to breathe,"" Garcia said. ""It was embarrassing."" Team loses 400 pounds for Winter Games . Embarrassment about her weight extended to other areas of her life. Although she was president of her sorority, Garcia always felt like she stood out. ""All the sorority girls had cookie-cutter form, and I looked different,"" she said. ""It was really hard for me to connect."" Garcia's involvement in Greek life perpetuated her unhealthy habits; she often went to bars and restaurants to mingle with her college friends. It was difficult to break the cycle, but she found supportive friends who also hit the gym. ""What I tell people is that you find new friends at the gym,"" she said. ""If you don't have the support, it's really hard to do it on your own."" Garcia found one of her biggest supporters through her sorority. She met Nicholas Monreal at a Greek function, and they began dating when she was at her heaviest. But the days of social functions, bar visits and restaurant outings are long gone for the couple. ""He was there when I realized I wanted to change,"" she said. ""To this day, our dates are to the gym. We see excitement in going on walks and runs."" The couple has been together for four years; he proposed in December. Monreal has noticed a significant difference in Garcia over the past few years -- not just physically. ""She's more energetic ... and she's more willing to try new things,"" he said ""She's just working very hard, and she's a better person for it."" On the right track . Since the beginning of 2010, Garcia has lost 107 pounds. There were setbacks, the biggest of which came this past August when she was in a car accident. She completed three months of physical therapy and wasn't able to go to the gym and do her daily routines for a month and a half. She was angry at first -- mad at the person who hit her car and stalled her progress at the gym. But she got over her initial anger, and Garcia went on a walk. This time, she wasn't alone. Her fiance, her parents, her sisters and her aunt encouraged her to stay active. As a result, Garcia went on walks with them and did yoga at a gym. Girl loses 65 pounds in fight against childhood obesity . After getting back on track with her daily workouts, Garcia realized she also had to better manage her eating habits. ""For the longest, I would go to the gym and go home to eat whatever I wanted,"" she said. ""That's not how it works. I had to learn to eat differently and to learn to like new foods."" She started doing research on proper nutrition. She read books and online articles, shopped at health foods stores and learned to prepare meals that helped her maintain a healthy diet. Now for two hours every Sunday, Garcia grills chicken, cooks vegetables and packs fresh fruit in preparation for the upcoming week. ""(I) make eating as simple as possible,"" she said. ""If there are a lot of ingredients, I don't want it."" The next step . Down to 128 pounds, Garcia has been left with a lot of loose skin -- particularly around her stomach. She is doing CrossFit exercises and weight training to tighten up the area. She's also checking off some other goals. One of the most rewarding moments in Garcia's weight loss journey was completing her first 5K run in 27 minutes. When she first started training, running three miles took her 48 minutes. Today, she can complete it in less than 25. ""I hadn't been able to walk a lap, let alone run it,"" she said. ""And now when I finish a workout, I really get emotional and I can't believe that I could do it."" She isn't stopping there. Garcia wants to complete a half marathon as well as the Warrior Dash in June. As a result, she might take a pool break in between. ""I really want to fit in my bikini comfortably this summer,"" she said. Today, Garcia doesn't shop at plus size clothing stores anymore. She was able to drop from a size 22 to a size 6. And what happened to her XXL ""fat shorts?"" She ditched them for a pair of small exercise shorts. To those just starting their weight-loss journey, she offers this advice: . ""Once you start, don't give up. The hardest thing to do is to continue. If you have a bad day, don't make it a bad week."" Father, son lose 260 pounds after weight loss surgery .

"(CNN) -- While an art student at Dumlupinar University, Turkish illustrator Murat Palta watched ""Star Wars"". As with the generations of fans that preceded him, he was struck by the film's epic quality. Though the movie is set in the future, Palta was reminded of the colorful Ottoman miniatures that illustrated Turkish literature from the 16th century. Gallery: Cult classics reimagined as Ottoman miniatures . ""I kept on trying to imagine what 'Star Wars' would look like if it was placed in the Ottoman era, so I decided it would be good to illustrate it,"" he recalls. Palta soon got hooked on reimagining Western cult classics in the Eastern tradition. For his graduation project, he expanded his portfolio to include antique-style versions of several cult classics, including ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Inception"" and an array of Scorsese and Tarantino movies. ""I guess I just really like movies,"" he admits. ""I just wanted to make fun of them, but not in a mean way."" There is an underlying playfulness throughout his illustrations. Each took a full day or two to complete using a combination of handmade stencils, watercolors and Photoshop. In his rendition of ""Scarface,"" Al Pacino shoots down his foes while wearing a fez. His ""Goodfellas"" gangsters drive horse and buggies instead of cars and in ""The Shining,"" Danny rides a bicycle made of wood. ""The first time I mentioned my project to my teachers, they didn't understand it,"" Palta admits. ""They said, 'why don't you illustrate Turkish movies?' I told them there's no point. I wanted to combine not just the two cultures -- Western and Eastern -- but the two styles: modern and traditional."" They were impressed when they saw the finished product, however, and Palta, since graduated, has moved on to display his work (he's gearing up for an exhibition in Florence, Italy at the Vaia Balekis Contemporary Art Gallery). The project is also far from over. ""I'm still working on it,"" he admits. ""I think next I'll illustrate 'Lord of the Rings' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' or maybe 'Pan's Labyrinth.'""

"(CNN) -- Bill Murray dances to his own music -- or, it turns out, to a good hip-hop tune with strangers. The actor popped up at a birthday party in Charleston, South Carolina, over the weekend, getting down with the crowd to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's hit ""Turn Down for What."" Murray is making as much of a name for dropping in on events as he has for some of his more more famous films like ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Caddyshack."" His appearance this time doesn't quite count as crashing, as it seems the birthday boy invited him through the party's chef, who is a friend of Murray's. The mercurial Murray didn't have to travel far -- he owns a home in Charleston -- for the latest stop on his ongoing comical mystery tour. For those keeping score, the funnyman has turned up at a Charleston bachelor party where he offered the groom some relationship advice, a Manhattan karaoke bar, a student house party in Scotland, a kickball game on New York's Roosevelt Island and an event at SXSW where he bartended, just to name a few. There's even a website dedicated to collecting Bill Murray stories, both the real and the fictitious (which, it turns out, sound a great deal alike). The Toronto Film Festival declared September 5 to be Bill Murray Day in part to ensure that he'd show up to promote his latest movie, ""St. Vincent."" Despite being an acclaimed actor, Murray has no agent or official representation and is not on social media. So good luck getting him as the cool factor at your next kegger unless you can do what execs have to when casting him in a Hollywood film: pick up the phone and give him a call.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton said Thursday that obtaining economic equality for women should become a ""political movement"" that is the ""lifeblood of this election and any election."" Flanked by other high-profile female lawmakers and a former aide, Clinton ramped up her usual message on gender equality by making a call to action. ""Political candidates and office-holders do pay attention when people vote on issues that are of concern to them,"" Clinton said during a roundtable at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. ""And that sound so simplistic, but ... when we can turn an issue into a political movement that demands people be responsive, during the election season, it carries over."" Clinton added: ""We have to make these issues part of every political debate."" Economic equality is a topic that Clinton talks about on a regular basis, but rarely in such political terms. As Democrats prepare for the midterm elections -- where control of the U.S. Senate is on the line -- the former secretary of state and presumed frontrunner for the presidential nomination in 2016 has put women's issues at the forefront to her message. Clinton to decide on 2016 presidential run around end of year . Clinton used a similar tone early this week in Iowa, where she said women should make their own health care decisions and that raising the minimum wage should be a women's issue because the majority of women hold those jobs. ""We need people to feel like they are part of a movement, that it is not just about an election,"" Clinton said at the Center for American Progress roundtable. ""It is about a movement, a movement to really empower themselves, their families and take the future over in a way that is going to give us back the country that we care so much about."" Also at the roundtable were House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Sens. Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, and Neera Tanden, a former Clinton aide who now is president of the think tank. Clinton's calls for a movement on women's empowerment were echoed by the women on the panel. ""We need a call to action to ask 6 million more women to be voting, 6 million more women to he heard,"" Gillibrand said, adding that women need ""to speak up, need to demand action.""

"MIAMI (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton covered all her bases in Miami on Thursday: She padded her wallet with a paid speech, pitched her memoir with a book signing and fundraised for a Democrat in a critical presidential state. This is becoming a familiar formula for Clinton. In October alone Clinton has four trips planned -- to Miami, Chicago, Las Vegas and San Francisco -- where she will combine a paid speech with either a book event or a fundraiser for a Democratic candidate or group. The strategy is part logistical, part practical for Clinton. But as she considers a presidential run in 2016, it is also calculated. Campaigning for Democrats in 2014 allows her to curry favor with her party ahead of 2016, while selling her book and speaking to paid gigs lets her raise her profile (not that it is needed) and toy with talking points in front of supportive audiences. Clinton ended her day Thursday in Florida at the sprawling Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables at a fundraiser for Charlie Crist, Florida's Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democratic candidate for governor. The event was closed to the press, but according to multiple sources in the room, Clinton both touted Crist as the right choice for governor and spoke about bigger picture issues like the a woman's right to choose, growing the middle class and the importance of the space program to Florida. The audience responded well to Clinton's fundraising calls, according to those in the room, and a Crist campaign spokesman told CNN that the event raised roughly $1 million for the Democrat's effort. The most expensive table at the event cost $50,000. Clinton also said, according to one source, that she believed in ""redemption and second chances,"" a remark that was seen as an acknowledgment of Crist's past as a Republican who called on Bill Clinton to resign the presidency during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The former Secretary of State started her day, however, at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, a white washed, swanky establishment were the Clinton was paid to appear before 1,200 people at the Commercial Real Estate Women Network Convention. The event was announced in May, long before her appearance with Crist was announced last month. Her speech to the women's group focused almost exclusively on attaining an equal playing field for women in business, sports and politics. Clinton called for paid leave, affordable childcare and equal pay for equal work during her speech -- all issues that would likely make up corner stones of a hypothetical presidential run. ""I believe if we don't dare to compete,"" Clinton told the women, ""we will never know what we are capable of doing."" She later implored the women in the audience to take risks: ""I cannot tell you how important it is for women like us, all of you and me and other like us, to model that risk taking. To get out of our own comfort zones, to be willing to fail. I have done that, too, on a very large stage."" The crowd was receptive, with one woman holding up a sign from Clinton's failed 2008 presidential campaign. ""You look beautiful,"" one woman screamed at the start of the speech. ""I think it is a grandmother glow,"" a loose and comfortable Clinton retorted. Shortly after the event, Clinton and her relatively small traveling entourage whisked across town to Book & Books in Coral Gables to sign copies of her memoir ""Hard Choices."" While Clinton's book events have become more sporadic than they were over the summer, the Miami event was added long after Clinton's attendance at CREW was confirmed. Over a thousand well-wishers braved the suffocating humidity and soaking rain to shake hands with Clinton and exchange pleasantries. Outside the event, Ready for Hillary -- the super PAC trailing Clinton to book events -- signed supporters up. ""Looks like there are some teeth coming in,"" proclaimed Clinton when she was presented a toddler. ""Goodness you are well dressed today,"" she joked to a man dressed in a blue stars and stripes sport coat. As for 2016 -- a question that came up a handful of times -- Clinton dodged and laughed. ""I'm waiting for you to announce, I hope it will be soon,"" said one woman. ""Thank you,"" Clinton responded. And just like that, after less than 12 hours in Miami, Clinton and her entourage were back to New York. All in a days work for a women who has books to sell, money to make and Democrats to support. Oh yeah, and a 2016 presidential campaign to consider.","Hillary Clinton was in Miami on Thursday for a fundraiser, a book event and a speech .

"(CNN) -- It's a beautiful fall morning looking out over the Avenue KlÃ©ber, just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe. I've checked into Room 309, a Grand Deluxe guestroom at The Peninsula Paris, on a brisk, blue-sky day that makes you want to stroll the streets with a stop at the boulangerie for a pain au chocolat, or two. But that might prove difficult. I'm not in Paris. I'm in Hong Kong, in an identical mock-up of the hotel's Paris rooms. The room's large, with three-meter ceilings you might find inside a century-old Beaux Arts building. There's a dressing room that's as big as the oval-shaped white marble bathroom next door, where the clock above the vanity is set to Paris time. In the bedroom, there's a stack of French magazines in a rack next to the sofa. It does feel like I'm in the French capital, even down to the exact street views you get from the real property. Peninsula's Paris hotel doesn't open until August, but the project team at The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels (HSH), Peninsula's parent company, designed and built this fully functioning model room back in 2011. Test before release . This is where Peninsula tries out new ideas and technology for a full year, before releasing its designs into the world. I'm the first journalist allowed access to see how the concept works. Such is the confidentiality surrounding these unseen rooms, I'm sworn to secrecy as a condition of my visit. The Paris property's pictures aren't even made available to me. This is basically a place to make mistakes, so they don't get made in the real world. ""What happens if you wake up in the middle of the night? Do you bump your knee on anything? If you're in the bathroom, does it all work?"" asks Clement Kwok, CEO of HSH. For example, the ""Dior grey"" carpet originally laid will never see action. When the housekeepers came in to vacuum, it grew bald patches. The built-in television cabinet flanked by a hidden mini-bar and built-in espresso machine (with bilingual instructions) replaces a design that featured a fireplace and an in-mirror hidden TV. The team learned that watching TV during daylight hours was impossible, due to the glare from the mirror, which stretched up to the ceiling. Eventually the fireplace was cut too, and the single-panel door design was revised because it was too heavy to lift. What I see, and what will appear in Paris, are two ivory-colored panels that split and slide up and down. Peninsula has been building these rooms at a location in Hong Kong with every new property or major renovation since the 1990s, including the construction of its tower rooms in Hong Kong (1994), and its hotels in Tokyo (2007) and Shanghai (2009). To visit Shanghai, I just have to go next door, where the colors are richer and bolder, and the accents Art Deco, in keeping with the hotel's location on the Bund. Tokyo's modern lines and Zen touches must be around here somewhere, though my hosts remain tight-lipped. Rooms full of secrets . I later learn the Tokyo tester room has been demolished. With construction in its final stages in Paris, and the Shanghai hotel open for more than three years, these rooms haven't seen as many visitors lately. But in 2011 and 2012, the Paris mock-up would have been busy with members of management teams and special guests staying one or two nights. Chairman Sir Michael Kadoorie, whose family opened the first Peninsula in Hong Kong 85 years ago, has stayed overnight in the Paris, Shanghai and Tokyo models. Even couples have shared the king-sized bed. At the end of their stay, guests are asked to fill out a questionnaire that can take hours to complete. Executives give their suggestions directly to the project team, or, in the case of COO Peter Borer, experiment with changes themselves onsite. Peninsula says Borer moved around and angled different sofas, armchairs, and coffee tables until he was satisfied with the setup. There was also debate over the look and feel of the curved bathroom in Paris and whether it was worth the wasted space (its predecessors in Shanghai and Tokyo are rectangular, though the guestrooms have a similar overall layout). Other changes were initiated from feedback that the room didn't feel ""Parisian"" enough. The color scheme was changed from beige and bronze, to grey and chrome, and the wall coverings, carpet, and some of the furniture was adjusted. And there were lots of other small tweaks, including the addition of a built-in reading light in a floor lamp. A world of mock-ups . Peninsula isn't the only hotel company to build and test model rooms. Starwood Hotels & Resorts which owns St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton, and others brands, has a design lab at its U.S. headquarters that features test rooms for some of its hotel lines, though not for each new property. And while Peninsula won't disclose how much it costs to build, test, and maintain the model rooms, its CEO says they are an investment worth making. ""The purpose of doing all of this is not to add more gold and silver into the design,"" Kwok explains. ""It is very focused on ergonomics, which is the sheer convenience of staying in that room and whether everything works."" My Paris stroll and fresh croissants will have to wait. I head down a short hallway past some Eiffel Tower-inspired art, open a mirrored door, and step back into the Hong Kong sunshine. The Peninsula Paris, the luxury hotel group's 10th hotel, is set to open on August 1. Peninsula is also planning properties in London and Yangon, Myanmar.","Peninsula Paris rooms ""tested"" in Hong Kong before release .

"(CNN) -- Zac Brown is a foodie. He sings about fried chicken, pecan pie and cold beer. Food and music are two things that are very close to this Grammy-award-winner's heart. ""I grew up singing as soon as I could talk. I grew up in the kitchen as soon as I could stand."" Brown told CNN while sitting in his tour bus strumming his guitar before a recent show at Chicago's Wrigley Field. It was his love of music and food that got Brown thinking about a better experience for some fans at his shows. He thought the traditional ""meet-and-greets"" were impersonal and did not allow for a performer to really know fans. So, he teamed up with his friend and chef, Rusty Hamlin, to create the ""Eat & Greet."" Brown also throws a giant music and food festival . ""What we love about the Eat & Greet is that it completely turns the table around on the fans"" Brown said ""We're eating with them and serving them, hanging out with them. That is the best fellowship we can create."" So where does chef Rusty get enough food to feed 150 selected fans in a strange town with only a few hours to prepare? ""My forte is to make a huge meal for a lot of people off the top of my head"" Hamlin explained as he headed in to the open air Greencity Market in Chicago. ""It is nerve-racking and it's very challenging, but why make it easy? This is my life, this is what we do."" For nearly five hours the chef bobbed and weaved through the various tents sampling fresh ingredients and looking for inspiration for this night's feast. ""Got some black garlic...it's fermented garlic""...""It's a rat-tail radish...It's got a really spicy kind of radish bite to it."" Finally some inspiration rolled over Rusty and he dialed up one of his assistants back at the kitchen outside Wrigley. ""How are you, buddy?"" he asked the voice on the other end of the phone ""We're gonna do a mixed beet salad today so I'm gonna need one of those large pots of water going."" In his phone Rusty carries the menus from every Eat & Greet since 2009. He mixes and matches to come up with something new every night) Hamlin's stage is 54-foot semi that has been converted in to a state- of- the art kitchen with all of the bells and whistles. Her name is ""Cookie"". Throughout the afternoon, Hamlin directs a staff of cooks as they start making the meal that will feed 150 people before the concert. It is a show in and of itself. ""Rusty's personality is way too big to be stuck back in a kitchen some place."" Brown said when describing his friend before they went out to talk to the gathered crowd who would enjoy this meal. For over an hour band members stand behind tables spooning large helpings of Rusty's food on to fans plates and Zac Brown stands at the end of the line talking to each and every person as the pass by. They are not curt conversations. People linger and talk food and music. There is one rule. No pictures or autographs. Brown says he thinks that takes away from really listening to everyone. ""I love that connection that is made and hopefully it's something they remember. A lot of times I'm playing and I walk out to the edge of the stage and people are looking at me through their phones so they're filming instead of being in the moment."" Brown reflected. ""It's kind of like going back to analog interaction, which I love."" And for fans lucky enough to break bread with the Zac Brown Band a picture is the last thing they needed to take away. Lisa Dent who attended the Wrigley Eat & Greet had a rave review. ""They had a rat-tail radish. I've never seen one, I've never consumed one. It was awesome!"" When the lights dimmed and the band walked through the ivy covered walls of the 100-year-old Wrigley Field it was time put down the plates and pick up instruments and play. After nearly three hours the band was playing the last song of the night and, once again, singing about fried chicken, pecan pie and cold beer.","Grammy-winning musician wanted a better experience for some fans at his shows .

"(CNN) -- As a Latina activist I was devastated to learn the President would delay executive action to keep undocumented immigrants with no criminal record from getting deported. He'd promised he'd do it, our community expected it, and the country's economy needed it -- especially as Republicans have abdicated their obligation to pass real and lasting legislative reform for our broken immigration system. But as a political strategist, I understand why the President delayed his decision. Let's be clear: This is Obama's promise delayed, not broken. The decision was indeed political. But unlike his critics on both sides of the aisle -- the activists who, like me, are deeply disappointed, and Republicans who hypocritically accuse him of giving Latinos a slap in the face -- I believe it was political for the right reasons. The President's action was a political ""Hippocratic Oath:"" first do no harm. There are a handful of vulnerable Democrats in very red states that are fighting to be re-elected, and control of the Senate is in the balance. Hanging on to a Democratic-controlled Senate is essential to the future of any legislative fix on immigration. It is also essential to keeping the President's Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, in place. If Republicans take over the Senate, Latinos -- indeed the entire country -- can kiss any possibility of real reform goodbye and can expect an immediate full frontal attack to repeal DACA. The President said on ""Meet the Press"" that the reason for the decision was that the politics on the issue had changed since he made the announcement in the Rose Garden in June. He is right. By June, public attention to the influx of unaccompanied minors was just starting to hit a crescendo. And Republicans were masterly in injecting cynicism as well as downright lies into the discussion of the cause of the influx and the security at the border. When the President finally makes his announcement before the end of the year, the American people, understandably distressed about what has been happening at the border, will deserve a full accounting on the realities of border security, the undocumented flows into the country, why our economy needs immediate action and why we need to achieve real legislative reform in the long run. With everything going on in the foreign policy arena as the country confronts a brutal terrorist organization in ISIS that is seeking to do us harm, as well as the politicking of midterm elections upon us, there is no room in the public square for a real dialogue that would explain and sustain the President's Executive Action and draw support to the reasons to work toward real reform. The President will need to lay out facts and figures that prove the border is safer and more secure now than ever before. These would include: . -- Under both President Clinton and President George W. Bush, the undocumented population grew at an unprecedented level. Even after the summer influx of undocumented children, under President Obama, the growth has been net negative. -- The flow of unaccompanied minors now is less than it was in February of 2013. -- There has been an unprecedented surge in resources at the border under President Obama that includes doubling the number of Border Patrol agents and tripling the money that goes to technology and infrastructure. -- The border is safer today and border crime is down from 10 years ago. He should reiterate the benefits of letting undocumented immigrants work and contribute legally to our economy. He should explain that in the long run, these immigrants should have to get right with the law, pass a background check, pay a fine and back taxes, learn English, and then get in line behind others who are following current legal procedures in order to become a U.S. citizen (key elements to real immigration reform). The President should underscore that passing real immigration reform will inject more than $700 billion into our economy over the next 10 years, and $1.4 trillion over the next 20, reduce the deficit by almost a $1 trillion in the next 20 years, raise wages, as undocumented workers will no longer be taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers, and boost our overall global competitiveness. There is a reason why most (even conservative) economists support immigration reform and why the business community has joined with the faith community, law enforcement leaders and labor in an improbable alliance of partners working toward this type of reform. While I am disappointed the President's executive action is not coming sooner--and any family ripped apart in the interim is one too many -- we also have to consider two things that will make it improbable that an undocumented immigrant without a criminal record in the interior of the country would be immediately removed: . 1) The 2011 new Department of Homeland Security policy that made it administration policy to deprioritize non-criminal undocumented immigrants and focus resources on removing the most dangerous criminals from our midst. In fact, of the 370,000 undocumented immigrants removed last year, all but 10,000 had criminal records -- and yes, that is still too big a number. This is why we need real reform now. 2) Since June, the removal architecture of the immigration system -- enforcement agents, and immigration judges -- has moved from the interior to the border to deal with the influx of unaccompanied minors more fairly and efficiently. I know these assurances are not enough for immigration activists seeking immediate relief. But even Latinos who are as deeply saddened as I am that we will not see action for another several weeks, at least, understand that what we will be getting from President Obama is far more effective and real than what we have gotten so far from Republicans who have turned their backs on our community and the American economy. If not for GOP inaction, immigration reform would be a reality today. So amigos, let's be confident President Obama will act before the end of the year. If he doesn't, I will be the first one to join you in a picket line at the White House.","As an activist, Maria Cardona devastated that Obama deferring executive order on immigration .
As a strategy, though, she gets it. He didn't want it used by GOP as election issue to win Senate .
She says if GOP wins, kiss immigration reform and DACA goodbye. Advocates, be patient .
Cardona: If he fails to deliver after vote, she'll join immigration activists, hold him to account ."
"(CNN) -- Diwali is one of the most important Hindu festivals in India -- but the colorful customs and meanings associated with it can vary dramatically depending on whether you reside in the countryside or the city. On the streets of densely populated conurbations like Mumbai, Diwali -- popularly known as the Festival of Lights -- is often a raucous affair, marked by a cacophony of firecrackers on the streets and a flourish of ceremonial gambling in the home. The wealthier urban dwellers splurge on gold, jewelry, clothes and expensive gifts such as electronics, which they buy for themselves and their loved ones. In the quiet tribal villages, such as those dotted around the vast state of Maharashtra in the west of India, the celebration is generally a more simple affair, defined by humble offerings and wholesome feasts. Few, if any, firecrackers are burst and many follow their own particular tribal traditions. Most villagers try and buy new clothes, but few can afford gold, jewelry or elaborate gifts. Are you an expert on Diwali? Take the quiz . Common traditions . There are some Diwali rituals common across most of the subcontinent. In both city and countryside, small clay oil lamps (or diyas) are placed at the thresholds of homes, shops and offices throughout the five-day affair to celebrate the legend of the return of the Hindu god, Lord Rama, to his kingdom after 14 years in exile. According to mythology his people lit diyas to welcome his return. Hindus in cities and villages also believe that during Diwali the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, will visit their homes if they are lit, clean and beautifully decorated. Windows and doors are left open to let the goddess in and homes are cleaned from top to bottom. Brightly-colored rangolis are drawn using fingers on the ground at the entrances to homes and offices. These geometric designs are usually symbols of nature and their purpose is to welcome guests and to encourage Lakshmi inside. Gambling card games are often played in both villages and cities, as it is generally considered auspicious to gamble during Diwali. This springs from a legend that a Hindu deity played a dice game with his consort on the fourth day of Diwali and she won. Some Hindus believe Lakshmi can be invoked through gambling. Place your bets . Gambling parties are an especially popular pastime during Diwali in Mumbai. The parties typically start at 10pm in bungalows and farmhouses and continue until 5am. ""Bets can start as small as Rs 20 (40 cents) and as big as Rs 5,000 ($93). In a night people can lose up to Rs 50,000 ($930),"" explains Vikram Mehta, 30, founder of Red Om Entertainment in Mumbai. ""People don't mind losing -- it's part of the ambiance and people are having fun. Everyone dresses up, everyone is on holiday, everyone is inviting each other to their homes, there is a lot of warmth."" A range of games are played, the most popular being Teen Patti (three-card brag) with Blackjack and poker also favorites. ""People sit on mattresses on the floor. There are rooms where the kids play for fun and then other rooms with the higher stakes,"" Mehta says. The houses are decorated with diyas, people dress in traditional Indian dress, servants wander round with platters of kebabs, biryani and Indian sweets, he adds. Across the country Indian sweets -- known as mithai -- are exchanged and people have large family gatherings in their homes. More from CNN Celebrates: Your frighteningly fun Halloween shots . New year, new accounts . Diwali also marks the start of the new Hindu financial year and many businessmen, traders and shopkeepers, open new accounts books. Businessmen in certain states, particularly Gujarat, worship their accounts books. There are various other rituals celebrated in towns and villages on each of the five days. For example, on the last day of Diwali in many parts of India, a sister cooks for her brother and he bestows gifts on her in celebration of the love between siblings. ""The modern world is changing and festivals are the only way to keep our culture and traditions alive. For us Diwali is the victory of good over evil, the returning of good back into our lives and starting a new year with a positive approach and forgetting all the bad that has happened,"" says 45-year-old Mumbai housewife Heena Damle. ""You have tables ready with sweets to offer if someone comes to your home,"" adds her nephew Pranav Damle, 29. iReport: Diwali's lights and colors . Lighting up the night . Typically fire crackers are set off from dusk, often throughout the night. The noise is believed to herald the defeat of evil and catch the attention of the gods. 19-year-old rag picker Santosh, whose family migrated from a Maharashtrian village to Mumbai, says: ""People in the villages have limited means, so it's not very spectacular. In Mumbai, the rich celebrate it with a lot of pomp. We witness huge fireworks and can get such fancy crackers."" Some, however, are concerned that the original traditions of Diwali are being lost in cities. Inir Pinheiro is managing director of Grassroutes, which promotes responsible village tourism, and will take 60 urban Indians on trips to three tribal villages in Maharashtra this Diwali. He says many of them want to ""see an unadulterated way of celebrating Diwali, a less noisy place and to reconnect with the people."" ""I think people in the cities are beginning to realize there is a lot of show in the way it is celebrated and a large materialistic aspect to it. People want to see if there is something more to the celebration,"" Pinheiro says. Hopes for the harvest . In the 500-person village of Purushwadi in Maharashtra, one of Pinheiro's selected rural destinations, families of five typically live in two-bedroomed stone houses. Dutta Kondar, 27, a farmer from the Mahadeo Koli tribe, says that Diwali is a ""celebration of the end of the harvest of kharif (rain-fed crops)."" Since harvest is when the villagers make money, villagers carry out Lakshmi puja (prayer ritual) on their assets at Diwali, giving thanks and praying for a good harvest to come. ""We conduct a small puja of our cattle, grain and cash,"" Kondar says. Family members hold a plate of offerings to the gods and chant prayers while rotating the plate around the assets, he explains. ""To make sure our bodies are prepared for the winter, we eat lots of oil and sweets,"" Kondar adds. ""Whenever anyone enters their house, the villagers offer each other sweets. But they don't buy presents for each other - money being a big constraint,"" Pinheiro says. Village values . Like many rural villages across India, Purushwadi has its own particular rituals. Pinheiro says one of the most popular is the local singing ceremony. ""This is when children go round the houses holding hand-made lanterns made of sticks and twigs and they sing Marathi songs for the benefit of residents of the homes. In return they are given oil and grain,"" Pinheiro says. ""The difference in how Diwali is celebrated in the villages is that it is done with more simplicity. It is the rare occasion when they buy clothes and eat nice food and they are celebrating after many months of hard work.. In the cities it is less community-oriented, noisier and more about spending money and showing off,"" Pinheiro adds. Join CNN to document the events that bring us all together.

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old girl from Arizona has called out Dick's Sporting Goods for failing to include female athletes in its 2014 basketball catalog -- and she's getting plenty of backup on the Web. McKenna Peterson's letter to the company, which her father later tweeted, drew attention to the lack of gender equality in the ads. ""I think that girls should be treated as equally as boys are treated,"" she wrote. ""I, myself, enjoying playing and watching basketball, WOMENS basketball."" The self-proclaimed ""Fabulous Basketball Player"" has been praised on Twitter for bringing attention to the issue. Although the basketball catalog does include women, they are portrayed in passive or supportive roles: ""sitting in the stands"" or ""mentioned once in the catalog on page 5 for some shoes"" or as ""cheerleaders on some coupons,"" McKenna wrote. ""It's hard enough for girls to break through in this sport as it is, without you guys excluding us from your catalog,"" she added. The Petersons say they may take their business elsewhere unless Dick's resolves to include more women in its advertising; McKenna even named several of her favorite professional women's basketball players who would fit the bill in the letter. ""Maybe my dad will take me to some other store that supports girls to actually PLAY basketball and follow their dreams and not sit on the sidelines and watch the game to get my next pair of shoes and equipment,"" McKenna wrote. UPDATE: McKenna's father, Chris Peterson, tweeted out a response note the family received from Dick's and expressed his disappointment with the ""form letter.""

"(CNN) -- If you've never been to Tokyo's Hotel Okura, you're missing out on one of the true accommodation stars of Asia -- a beautiful time capsule of a hotel that glorifies the design and service of Japan in the 1960s. It's one of my favorite places to stay in the world. Next August, however, its main building is slated for tearing down to make way for a new, bigger hotel in advance of the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. Okura's problem is also its main appeal -- it seems stuck in time. Built in 1962, before Tokyo's last Olympics, the hotel is a masterpiece of Japanese aesthetics and modernist design that's remained largely untouched over more than five decades. It's hard not to fall in love with the elegance of the main lobby, lit by hanging, hexagonal lanterns and furnished with chairs and tables that resemble plum blossoms. The map with a Seiko clock -- displaying time zones in cities across the world -- still includes Leningrad as an option. The Bar Highlander whiskey lounge serves cocktails that have long fallen out of favor elsewhere in the world. Devoted staff look after customers with a level of devotion that's rapidly disappearing elsewhere. After helping me buy tickets to a baseball game in Yokohama last year, I was given a packet of directions not just to the city or the stadium, but to my actual seat. Not the time nor the place for progress . I even love all the things about the Okura that annoy my friends and colleagues. Though the rooms have been renovated since the '60s, they feel cramped and outdated by modern standards. Sending the most petite lady on staff to deliver 100 kilos of camera equipment to my room isn't a great display of hotel management. And the room service menu is, I think, the most expensive in Asia. (For the money, that better be the best burger in the entire world.) Somehow the origami turtle on my pillow seems to make up for all manner of faults. On the whole, though, the Hotel Okura makes up for in character whatever it lacks in efficiency or modern amenities. In Asia, a part of the world defined by an ethos of tear-it-down and build-it-back-bigger (and faster and more tech savvy), the Hotel Okura pays homage to best of the way things used to be. The hotel says the new building will maintain the traditional Japanese aesthetic and the concept of the lobby, but it seems impossible that a new building will be everything the old one was. I know there's a time and place for progress and renovation. I just don't think it's this time or this place. The folks at Monocle magazine have started a petition to save the old Okura. I hope they succeed. If they don't, I'll be booking a room next August to say goodbye.

"(CNN) -- The mother of Kenneth Bae has left North Korea ""more anxious than ever"" to bring her imprisoned and ailing son home. In a statement she released Tuesday, Myunghee Bae said she was able to visit her son three times and was relieved to see his health was improving. ""I was happy to see him and to hold him, but it broke my heart to leave him behind,"" she said. ""I am more anxious than ever to bring him home. His year-long imprisonment has taken a heavy toll not only on Kenneth but on the whole family; every day the pain and anxiety continue to carve a deep scar on all of our hearts."" Earlier this year, Bae, a Korean-American, was sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp for what the government called ""hostile acts."" His family had not been able to see him for almost a year since his November 3 arrest in North Korea. Myunghee Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, said that she pleaded with the North Korean authorities to let her visit her son, and expressed gratitude for granting permission. She arrived late last week, with the goal of encouraging her son who has become ill, according to a website dedicated to Kenneth Bae's freedom. In a prison interview released in July, Kenneth Bae had spoken of health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. He looked noticeably thinner and wore a blue prison garment streaked with sweat and dirt. His family say he has lost more than 50 pounds. ""My heart was broken into pieces when his prison interview was released on July 3,"" said his mother, in an earlier statement. ""His appearance was very shocking, he looked so different, and he lost so much weight. I could not believe that prisoner was my son."" Bae was moved to a hospital for serious health problems, his sister, Terri Chung had told CNN in August. In previous interviews, Chung has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain, kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. He was already dealing with diabetes. His family and friends have asked North Korea for mercy and the United States for help in securing his release. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae. In August, the two countries appeared close, but North Korea rescinded an invitation to a U.S. envoy. Ambassador Robert King, President Barack Obama's special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, had been expected to fly to Pyongyang to try to win his freedom. In previous instances, North Korea has released Americans in its custody after a visit by some U.S. dignitary -- in recent cases, former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Bae was arrested last year after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a port in the northeastern corner of North Korea. His sister says that Bae is the owner of a tour company and was in North Korea for work. The North Korean government accuses Bae of setting up bases in China for the purpose of ""toppling"" the North Korean government, encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government and conducting a ""malignant smear campaign."" The country's state media also says that Bae had planned what it called a ""Jericho operation"" to bring down North Korea through religious activities. They have suggested that Bae could have been sentenced to death, but avoided it through ""candid confession of his crimes."" ""I plead with our government to do everything in their power to secure my son's release soon,"" Myunghee Bae said Tuesday.","Myunghee Bae said she was able to visit her son three times .

From the top of 11,166-foot Lone Peak Mountain, there's nothing below you but wide-open slopes and powder bowls with sweeping views across Montana and Wyoming. Between the town's two ski resorts -- Big Sky and Moonlight Basin -- there are three mountains used by an average of only 2,500 skiers per day ... it works out to 2 acres per skier. That means long, floating runs and nonexistent lift lines. Sunset: 7 warming winter trips . 2. You've never seen so much powder . Low humidity and moderate temperatures give Big Sky its characteristic ""cold smoke"" powder (it's also the name of a local microbrew). On top of that, the area gets dumped with 400 inches of this light, fluffy stuff annually. Compare that with 350 in Park City, 309 in Telluride, and 300 in Aspen. Mammoth Mountain in Southern California gets as much snow, but with three times the crowds. Sunset: Glacier National Park's top wow spots . 3. The après-ski scene has a Wild West twist . Cowboy boots, horseshoes over doorways, antler coatracks, and drinks with names like Moose Drool and Range Rider Red Big Sky's restaurants don't let you forget you're in cowboy country. Dig into T-bones the size of a Stetson at the Corral Bar & Steakhouse, a 1946 log restaurant with wagon-wheel chandeliers. Another favorite is Buck's T-4 Lodge and Restaurant, with its stone fireplace, smoked-trout appetizers, pan-seared deer sirloin, and yes, more wagon-wheel chandeliers. 4. You mix up your skiing with a winter safari . Ski vacation or wilderness trip? Here you get both. To see the wild side of the Gallatin Valley, saddle up with Jake's Horses to clop along the Gallatin River. The bears are hibernating, but keep an eye out for bighorn sheep, coyotes, eagles, moose, and elk that migrate from Yellowstone National Park to warm up at the lower elevation. 5. You step out of your skis and into cowboy boots . Sure, you could stay at a slopeside condo, but there are places with more Montana flair. The 320 Guest Ranch, 12 miles outside of Big Sky, has cozy log cabins along the Gallatin River. After a dinner of local beef, elk tenderloin, or cornmeal-crusted trout, head out on a sleigh pulled by hearty draft horses. Burrow under blankets and listen to the wrangler's ranch tales, while you cruise through the forest and enjoy hot cider and chili. Getting there . Big Sky is 56 miles south of Bozeman airport. Nonstop flights to BZN are available from Denver, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. Big Sky Resort (full-day ski pass $79; bigskyresort.com) is at 1 Lone Mountain Trail; Moonlight Basin (ski season opens Dec 12; full-day pass from $55; moonlightbasin.com) is at 1020 State 64.

"(CNN) -- It's a landmark that most players can only dream of, but for Lionel Messi it was just a matter of time. In a career already groaning under the weight of milestones, Messi duly passed another one on Saturday scoring his 400th goal for club and country as Barcelona smashed six unanswered goals past Granada at the Nou Camp. The landmark strike came in the 61st minute of the match -- heading in Dani Alves' volleyed cross -- to put Barca 4-0 up after a goal from Ivan Rakitic and two from Neymar had all but wrapped up three points before the break. Neymar completed his hat-trick in the 66th minute before Messi tucked away his 401st career goal late on to complete the rout and seal Barca's biggest win in La Liga this season. Messi, still only 27 years old, has now scored 359 goals in competitive matches for Barcelona and 42 for Argentina. ""I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,"" Messi said on his official Facebook page. ""Thanks for all the congratulations on scoring 400 goals with FC Barcelona and the Argentinian National Team. I'll continue working hard to reach more targets,"" he added. 'Magic wand' Barca manager Luis Enrique was quick to heap praise on his midfield maestro. ""I don't think if we added together the goals we have scored on the playground it would reach 400,"" Enrique said after the match. ""Messi is someone who has been touched by a magic wand and he is desperate to enjoy playing football."" The four-ton mark was passed by his La Liga rival Cristiano Ronaldo last January, but the Argentine has bragging rights after reaching the total in just 525 appearances compared to the Portuguese who took 653 games. As one landmark is reached another substantial record heaves into view as Messi looks to pass Telmo Zarra's all-time La Liga goal-scoring record of 251. Barcelona's win puts them top of the table with 16 points and a very healthy +17 goal difference -- a stat helped not only by recent high-scoring wins but also by clean sheets in their opening six league games. Two points behind are last year's champions Atletico Madrid who also romped to victory on Saturday. Diego Simeone returned to the dugout following a touchline ban to see his team maintain their unbeaten start to the La Liga season with a 4-0 win against Sevilla. First-half goals from Koke and Saul Niguez put Los Rojiblancos in control before two late second-half goals sealed all three points -- a Raul Garcia spot kick made it three in the 82nd minute before Raul Jimenez made it four in the last minute of normal time. The win keeps lifts Atletico to second, one point ahead of Valencia who travel to Real Sociedad on Sunday. City rivals Real continued their recent run of form with a 2-0 win at Villarreal -- Luka Modric and Ronaldo on target for the visitors. Carlo Ancelotti's side are now level on 12 points with Celta Vigo who beat Elche 1-0 on Friday. Chelsea march on in EPL . Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Chelsea continue to dominate proceedings this term, picking up a fifth win in six matches with a 3-0 defeat of Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa's Â£32 million ($52 million) price tag is looking increasingly cheap as the Spanish striker netted for the eighth time since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer. Costa's 59th minute strike gave Chelsea a two-goal cushion after Oscar had opened the scoring in the seventh minute. Willian scored a third 11 minutes from time to ensure Jose Mourinho's side remain three points clear at the top of the table with 16 points. Former Chelsea man Frank Lampard was on target again for his new club as Manchester City beat Hull City 4-2. The win keeps Manuel Pellegrini's side five points adrift of the top. Manchester United also won on Saturday beating West Ham 2-1 at Old Trafford to move up to eighth in the table. Goals from Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie gave Louis van Gaal's side only their second league win of the season. Rooney was later shown a red card for a reckless tackle on Stewart Downing and will miss the next three league matches. The day's two big derby matches ended in 1-1 draws with Liverpool and Everton sharing the points at Anfield while Arsenal had to come from behind against Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates.","Lionel Messi scores twice to pass 400 goals for club and country during career .

"London (CNN) -- Twenty-four people were arrested Wednesday during a London student protest over increased tuition fees, authorities said. The arrests were made on suspicion of public order offenses; offensive weapons; breaching the peace; being masked; and ""going equipped,"" or possessing equipment used for a criminal purpose, London's Metropolitan police said. The protest was expected to involve thousands of demonstrators in central London. About 4,000 officers were deployed, and authorities said they were ready to use rubber bullets on protesters if violence broke out. ""We're always concerned there will be trouble,"" Simon Pountain, Metropolitan police commander, said before the protest. ""It would be remiss of me not to have dealt with that in my planning for the event to make sure that I've got sufficient resources on duty to be able to deal with any eventuality. That's why I've got 4,000 officers available ... we'll be able to deal with any of those issues if they do arise. You've seen in previous protests where things can escalate and disorder can arise.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Few American presidents have been greeted with the enthusiasm Europe demonstrated for Barack Obama on his election. In part, it was a reaction against his predecessor -- George W. was never loved in the EU -- but there was also the feeling that Obama was a genuine multilateralist. Europeans, who welcomed Obama as the candidate of change, didn't expect him to agree with them on everything, but they believed that he would at least listen to them. So now that the showroom gloss is beginning to wear off Obama at home, now that U.S. poll respondents are indicating that the first dents and scratches are visible in the previously gleaming bodywork, how is he being seen between Ljubljana and Lisbon? In Europe's capitals, as in many places, there was something of a gulp when the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, a feeling that it was being bestowed in hope of what was to come rather than in recognition of what had been achieved. That said, Obama remains far more popular personally than Bush, whose Iraq war adventure with the eager assistance of British Prime Minister Tony Blair led to splits among Europe's leaders. On the diplomatic circuit, the movers and shakers will still fight for invitations whenever the president swings through European cities. On the plus side, there was a big welcome, except perhaps among some of the Eastern European states, when the president scrapped the missile defense plans with installations in Poland and the Czech Republic, indicating that he wanted to talk to Moscow rather than lob bricks over their neighbor's wall. Europeans, who don't possess America's military might and who nearly always, in Winston Churchill's words, prefer ""jaw, jaw to war, war,"" also welcomed Obama's early overture to Iran indicating that if Teheran would unclench its fist, then America was ready to extend its hand. After the strong influence the climate change deniers appeared to have with the previous administration, Europeans were especially pleased that Obama said he would come to the climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark. They were impressed with the way he helped to broker a deal at the G20 summit in London in April, something he managed to do without throwing his weight around. It is a measure of the president's continued pulling power that the Europeans, who have seemingly grudged every extra pair of boots the NATO secretary general has persuaded them to dispatch up until now, are to stump up around 7,000 additional troops for the war in Afghanistan alongside the 30,000 more committed by a president who has now more than doubled the U.S. contingent there. But while Europe's diplomats and politicians know that the president, too, has to strike political balances, and while they recognize that shared values across the Atlantic won't always mean shared interests, a few niggles are creeping in. For all the talk about resetting relations between Washington and Moscow, the Europeans are worried that the crucial December 1 deadline passed without a deal renewing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty for monitoring nuclear arsenals. On Afghanistan, Europe's political leaders were muttering behind the scenes as the president took a long time making up his mind about the extra troops. To them, he seemed to be dithering; and with anti-war opinion building in their own backyards, he made their own lives more difficult while they awaited his decision. Some criticism has come into the open. For example, Bob Ainsworth, Britain's defense minister, has refused to commit the U.S.'s leading ally in Afghanistan to a pullout timetable beginning with the president's promised date of July 2011. Paddy Ashdown, who knows a bit about these things as the international community's former high representative in Bosnia, reckons that the president failed to produce a political strategy to go along with his military one. Obama, said Lord Ashdown, was trying to appeal simultaneously to two different audiences. He wanted to tell the folks back home in Peoria, Illinois, that the troops would be home in 18 months, and he wanted to tell the Taliban that an extra 30,000 troops were on their way to make life tough for them. The problem was that the folks back home would focus most on the extra 30,000 troops going out, and the Taliban would focus on the fact that they would start leaving in 18 months. Taliban leader Mullah Omar is supposed to have said: ""The enemy has the watches; we have the time."" Insurgents tend to have a longer time scale than democratic politicians, who only too soon will be facing electors once more. The Europeans, while they like much about Obama's style, are growing just a little uneasy about how things will pan out under his presidency. ""It's early days, but perhaps a little less talk and a little more do might be welcome,"" one former Downing Street insider told me. They weren't expecting Superman in the White House, certainly not at a time of major economic recession. They still feel that the new president is a man they can talk to. But they can see that power is moving inexorably from the the G8 to the G20, where Europe's influence will be diluted by major new players like China and India. They may become a little sensitive as the president is seen to cozy up to the new players. The Europeans also can read the Pew surveys in the U.S. showing that a greater proportion of Americans would like their nation to pull back from a world role and ""mind its own business"" than did so even during the Vietnam war. They will watch Obama now to see how he resists the pressures of isolationism. The slight unease one senses now in Europe's capitals is, in a sense, less a personal slippage for Obama than a growing recognition of the weakness of a debt-ridden U.S. economy and of the inability of the world's strongest military power to contain Islamic insurgencies or to find and dispose of Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar eight years after the mass murders of 9/11. The U.S. may still have the military might. But even America has to look at the costs column these days. And when the likes of French President Nicolas Sarkozy inveigh against the evils of the ""Anglo-Saxon economic model,"" they have Wall Street just as much in mind as they do the city of London. Obama, though, doesn't have to worry yet about his personal popularity in Europe. He remains a beacon of hope to many Europeans. And he will probably remain rather more popular in Europe than he is at home because it is in tackling the back-pocket issues with their own electorates -- like health care -- that most politicians make their enemies. That may, however, be little consolation to a president with a second term to win in due course. Blair, after all, remained hugely popular in the U.S. But so discredited did he become back home that he was forced to step down and hand over power to Gordon Brown.","President Obama was widely supported by many European countries .

"(CNN)   -- At six foot five, with his shock of blonde hair shaved into a fat Mohawk and talking in a languid Georgian drawl, Omar Jarun looks like he was once part of an all-conquering college basketball team. But the 26-year-old American doesn't play basketball. Or at least not well. ""I played recreational basketball for one season,"" he told CNN. ""People told me I should try it because of my height. But I wasn't any good at it."" Instead life had a different path for Jarun, one that would take him far from his native Peachtree City, Georgia. On Sunday he will line up as a defender for the Palestinian national soccer team as they take on Afghanistan in a match that, just one year on from the World Cup final in South Africa, represents one of the first steps towards qualification for the next tournament in Brazil in 2014. Besides being Palestine's first World Cup match on home soil, Sunday's encounter will have extra significance for Jarun. It will be the first time he has ever set foot in the West Bank and he plans to visit his ancestral town of Tulkarem. His team traveled for 24 hours to be able to play their first match against Afghanistan. The game was moved from Kabul to the tiny aluminum smelting town of Tursunzade in southern Tajikistan -- a few miles from the Uzbek and Afghan border -- for fear of violence in Afghanistan. Palestine won 2-0 and now have a good chance of qualifying for the second round where they would play Thailand. The return match, to be held Sunday in Ramallah, will also be a landmark: Palestine's first ever World Cup match on home soil. ""My dad taught me to play the game. He would always take me and my brother out and we would always play around the back yard,"" Jarun says. ""I kicked football in high school, and I was actually pretty good at it. They wanted me to pursue it in college but I didn't really want to. I wanted to play with a team, I really wanted to play soccer."" Jarun's remarkable story began in Kuwait. Along with his sister, his American mother and Palestinian father, he fled the country in 1990 when Saddam Hussein's forces invaded the kingdom and sparked the first Gulf War. ""I remember bombs going off. Missiles shooting off near the apartment. I remember grabbing my bear, me and my sister running to my dad's bedroom and saying: 'What's going on?'"" he recalled. ""The next morning my dad would come in shaking from the bombs going off. Because we are American, my mom managed to get the entire family in to the U.S. We left everything behind. My parents had nothing."" Growing up, Jarun soon discovered his love for soccer, playing for AFC Lightning, the same youth team that nurtured U.S. internationals Clint Mathis and Ricardo Clark. His Arab heritage was seldom an issue, he says, but he noticed a change after 9/11. ""By looking at me, I look like a white boy,"" he laughed. ""You don't get judged immediately like my father does. Like an Arab. He gets judged right away. But you look at me and you don't think I'm Arab. ""Before 9/11 there were no problems, really. I had always established myself as an American from the Middle East. After 9/11 it was very difficult. My dad would tell me: 'Be careful what you say.' I would get double, tripled-checked at the airport. You know it's for safety for the country, so I don't have many complaints about it."" After stints playing for the Atlanta Silverbacks, Vancouver Whitecaps and then in the Polish league, Jarun returned to the U.S. and joined F.C. Tampa Bay in America's second tier league. But by now he had become an international footballer. A scout from the Palestinian Football Federation discovered him while on a tour looking for professional players from the Palestinian diaspora that might qualify to play for the national team. ""At the time, when I thought of the national team I thought I could play for the U.S. national team at some point but I never really got the opportunity, so I took this one. I really had no idea I'd be in the Palestinian national team,"" he said. ""I knew it wasn't going to be the best set-up, I knew it wouldn't be particularly professional. But I could do my part. I didn't know what I could do for the Palestinian people apart from play football. So when they told me I could play for the Palestinian national team I said yes."" Many will be surprised that Palestine even has a national team. In 1998 FIFA, world football's governing body, recognized Palestine, making it one of the few international bodies to place it alongside other nation states. But following the outbreak of the second intifada in 2000, and the imposition of restrictions for residents of the West Bank by the Israelis, the local league was cancelled and national team players were prevented from traveling abroad to fulfil their fixtures. When qualification for the 2006 World Cup began, so many players were prevented from leaving Gaza and the West Bank that only nine could start against Uzbekistan in a match in Doha, Qatar. Today the team is a patchwork of bureaucracy. They fly on seven different sets of papers that make moving through every border, be it Jordanian, Israeli or Tajik, a tough task. One, Roberto Bishara, plays for Palestino in the Chilean first division, a team set up by Palestinian immigrants. Three others are Israeli Arabs who have played in Israel's first division while most of the rest play in Jordan or for teams in the newly professional West Bank Premier League. The coach, Mousa Bezaz and his assistant are French Algerian; eight players and the goalkeeper coach are from Gaza, which is controlled by the militant Palestinian movement Hamas and in many ways cut off from the outside world. Others have an East Jerusalem ID, a separate identity reserved for those Palestinians who live in the divided city or have family there. Gaza-born players who now play in the West Bank have recently been refused re-entry when trying to come home via Jordan. Arguably the team's best player, defender Abdel Latif Bahdari, was repeatedly refused permission to leave Gaza through Egypt due to a ban on visas for men aged between 18 and 40. By the time he finally got out it was too late for him to make the team. Jarun recalls first meeting his teammates. ""Their first impressions were: 'Who the hell is this guy? How the hell is this guy Palestinian?' But they welcomed me in like I was one of the brothers. It wasn't like I was an outsider. No one was judging each other. ""They could tell I had good intentions for the team. Being an American I can explain to people in America what was going on in their country."" Jarun believes victory on Sunday will do far more than send Palestine into the next round. ""I think the match is huge man. Sport brings countries together and I don't know a better way for the world to know about Palestine apart from this soccer team,"" he explained. ""Coming from outside, I feel that this is such a big step for this country. We can show that the Palestinians are normal people.""","Palestine's soccer team plays Afghanistan in a World Cup qualifying match .

"(CNN) -- Long before he was accused of murder, Oscar Pistorius was toasted the world over for his triumph over a disability. His lightning running speed -- which took him all the way to the Olympics despite using carbon legs -- attracted sponsorships worth millions. But as his murder trial dragged on, his popularity plummeted and sponsors abruptly dropped him. Now that a judge has found him guilty of negligent homicide, what's next for the man known as the Blade Runner? When will he be sentenced? Judge Thokozile Masipa granted him bail Friday, and set sentencing for October 13. Sentencing is not a one-day affair in South Africa. The prosecution wanted him held without bail, saying he sold his immovable assets, and that makes him a flight risk. The judge disagreed. Will he return to competitive running? Though he has been running during the trial, he has not been involved in any competitions. He's said he runs because it relaxes him and gets his mind off things. It's unclear if he will return to competitive running. He is known to be a fierce, passionate competitor -- driven by a need for speed and adrenaline. Has he reached out to Reeva Steenkamp's family? Pistorius says he's tried to, but her family is not ready to talk to him. Her mother, June Steenkamp, has confirmed that. During the trial, he tried to reach out to them, her mother said. Pistorius' sister, Aimee, also tried to pass a note to Steenkamp, but she shunned it. ""It won't bring my daughter back,"" she told the Daily Mirror. ""We just want to know the truth."" On Friday, the second day of the verdict, Pistorius made another attempt at greeting her relatives in court. What about his sports endorsements? Pistorius had coveted endorsements both overseas and in his home country. With his negligent homicide conviction, they probably won't be coming back. His most prominent sponsor was Nike, a deal reportedly worth about $2 million and signed in 2012. But it also turned into a liability during his murder trial. Nike's ad referred to him as ""the bullet in the chamber,"" words you don't want associated with you when you're accused of shooting your girlfriend to death. Nike dropped him in February of last year. Others followed suit, including M-Net Movies. The South African TV channel had featured him in an ad campaign. How much time is he facing? There's no legal maximum (or minimum) sentence for culpable homicide, said Kelly Phelps, a CNN legal analyst. A typical sentence is five to eight years. But it is a principle of South African law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person, as opposed to the crime. That makes predicting a sentence difficult. Will he get special treatment in prison? If observation is anything to go by, the double amputee may be put in the same area as the general population -- even blind prisoners are placed with sighted prisoners in South Africa. But, ahead of his release on bail last year, the African National Congress Women's League said the athlete benefited from special privileges, adding that his family could visit him outside visiting hours, unlike relatives of other inmates. Can both sides appeal? Pistorius can appeal the verdict or the sentence, potentially to the supreme court and even eventually to South Africa's constitutional court. But the state can appeal only if it believes the judge has misinterpreted the law in reaching her verdict. The right to appeal depends on whether, based on the facts of the case, the initial judge or magistrate believes a different court could possibly reach a different verdict. South Africa's highest court, known as the constitutional court, was once just for cases regarding constitutional matters, but a recent act of parliament broadened its responsibilities. CNN's Emily Smith and Richard Greene contributed to this report.","Pistorius has reached out to Reeva Steenkamp's family .

"(CNN) -- St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch juggled two roles on Wednesday: overseeing the presentation of evidence in the Michael Brown case to a grand jury and responding to the flurry of attacks and calls for his recusal from the case. McCulloch went on the offensive after Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon tried to deflect calls for the prosecutor's ouster by saying it was up to McCulloch to recuse himself. McCulloch's deep ties with local police and perceived favoritism of law enforcement in criminal cases have led to concerns about his ability to be impartial in the Brown case. Should he recuse? In a statement sent to the media on Tuesday night, Nixon said, ""From the outset, I have been clear about the need to have a vigorous prosecution of this case, and that includes minimizing any potential legal uncertainty."" ""I am not asking St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch to recuse himself from this case. There is a well-established process by which a prosecutor can recuse themselves from a pending investigation, and a special prosecutor be appointed. Departing from this established process could unnecessarily inject legal uncertainty into this matter and potentially jeopardize the prosecution,"" Nixon said. McCulloch's response: Nixon needs to ""man up."" ""It's the typical Nixon doublespeak,"" McCulloch said during a radio interview with The McGraw Show on KTRS. ""He says nothing and he's ducking."" McCulloch said the state of emergency Nixon declared on Saturday gave the governor authority to remove McCulloch from the case. McCulloch said Nixon should ""just make a decision."" ""He doesn't need a reason,"" McCulloch said to KTRS, ""all he has to do is a simple yes he's out, or no he's not out, and let's move on. The Brown family deserves that and the rest of the community deserves it."" McCulloch firmly stated he is not removing himself from the case. ""I have absolutely no intention of walking away from the duties and responsibilities entrusted to me by the people of this community. I've done it for 24 years,"" he said. The clock is ticking for a decision, according to McCulloch. Now that the presentation has begun, recusing the main prosecutor could complicate matters even more. ""The most devastating thing that could happen, is if a week from now, a month from now he (Nixon) decides that he's taking me off this case and everybody is starting over. Stand up, man up,"" said McCulloch, ""This family deserves nothing less than that."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Grand jury presentation . Wednesday marked the first day of evidence presentation to the grand jury, a process that will likely continue into the fall. ""We will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury,"" McCulloch said on KTRS. ""Every statement that a witness made, every witness, every photograph, every piece of physical evidence. Absolutely nothing will be left out, so the grand jury is making their decision based upon absolutely everything and we'll go from there."" But not all the evidence is ready to be presented, according to McCulloch, which is why prosecutors will have to present in parts. ""As things are completed they'll be presented to the grand jury,"" said McCulloch during an interview with CNN affiliate KMOV. ""But we want to get the process started, and not wait until absolutely everything is done before we even start it."" Overwhelming Volume of Evidence . The evidence in the shooting death of Michael Brown involves investigations from multiple agencies, including the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis Police Department, FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice. Asked how many witnesses have been interviewed so far, McCulloch told KMOV, ""I don't know. Dozens and dozens, maybe hundreds."" He said the FBI has been successful at locating witnesses in the Canfield apartments, near where Brown was killed. ""The federal government is doing their independent investigation, and so they're also talking to witnesses, and ultimately that will be made available to us,"" McCulloch told KMOV. ""They're doing their own forensic testing. They've done their own or will do their own post-mortem examination, and those results will be provided, all to the grand jury."" Grand jury time line . McCulloch estimated prosecutors will finish presenting the case by mid-October, a time line that brings its own set of challenges with the grand jury calendar, because the current session ends in early September. ""We will be presenting what we can, between now and the end of their term, which is early September,"" McCulloch told KTRS, ""after that, their term is extended just for this case and that's all they will be doing. They can meet for as long as they want, as long as they want to meet."" ""We present the full case to the grand jury and should there be an indictment, the full case will be presented to the trial jury so that they make the decision,"" McCulloch said. ""I don't decide if somebody is guilty or not guilty. I present the evidence to a jury and the jury makes that decision."" Magazine: The Aftermath in Ferguson .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway last summer was sane at the time of the alleged crimes, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said in a report released Tuesday. Anders Behring Breivik was charged last month with committing acts of terror and voluntary homicide. He is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo, then going to Utoya Island outside the city and systematically gunning down 69 more people, many of them teens and young adults. The mass killing on July 22 was the single largest loss of life in Norway since World War II. Breivik has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carrying out the attacks, according to the judge handling his case previously. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. However, the court sought a second opinion because of the importance of the question of sanity to Breivik's trial. The two psychiatric experts recommended he spend four weeks under 24-hour psychiatric monitoring, according to court documents released in February. The Tuesday report said Breivik was not psychotic at the time of the crimes, does not suffer from a psychiatric condition and is not mentally challenged. ""There is a high risk for repeated violent actions,"" said the report from Terje Torrissen and Agnar Aspaas. Breivik's trial is set for April 16 and is expected to last up to 10 weeks. If he is convicted, his punishment will be based on the determination of his sanity. It may not be possible for him to receive the maximum punishment if he is deemed insane. Authorities have described Breivik as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to him posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway's Labour Party. Breivik showed some of his extremist views during a February hearing, which began with him entering court with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute. He insists nobody could believe that he was insane, and describes questions about his mental condition as ridiculous, his attorney, Geir Lippestad, has said. Breivik claims the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, Lippestad said. The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp.

"London, England (CNN) -- With only days to go before the U.N. High Level Panel puts forward its recommendations on development goals beyond 2015, after the current Millennium Development Goals expire, progress towards gender equality and increased empowerment of women hangs in the balance. It is vital that this issue does not slip down the global agenda but retains its rightful position as one of the key, stand-alone development goals. The current goals contain a specific commitment to women's equality and empowerment, which has -- while not perfect -- succeeded in putting the subject firmly on the global map, giving impetus and strength to organizations working in this field, in their relations with governments, their ability to push against cultural barriers, and their capacity to raise funds for their work. That's why we've seen some progress in recent years. More girls are going to school, and the gender gap in formal education is closing in the majority of countries. In some areas such as North Africa and the Middle East, more women than men are enrolled in tertiary education, but women have yet to catch up in political representation, technology, access to capital and management skills, to name but a few examples. In the discussions that are taking place about what will replace the Millennium Development Goals post-2015, there are voices arguing for abandonment of this stand-alone commitment to women's equality, in favor of a more generalized commitment to tackle 'inequality.' Were these voices to carry the day, the negative effect on progress towards gender equality would be substantial, but crucially it would also undermine the cause of reducing 'inequality.' This is because improving the status of women is crucial to tackling the very inequalities that it is suggested the new goals should focus on. Whether it's making sure that children have access to education or health care, or bringing in more income for the family, so many of these core development goals are primarily delivered by women. Women are on the road to becoming drivers of their economies, running businesses, and creating jobs and opportunities within their communities and beyond. According to the World Bank, we need to create 600 million jobs globally by 2020, mainly in developing countries, just to keep up with population growth. But we will inevitably fail to achieve employment targets unless many more women have economic opportunities. The more power they have, the more they can deliver. I have seen for myself how women's financial independence delivers benefits to their families and to wider society. On a recent trip to Israel and Palestine, I spoke with some women entrepreneurs and asked them what they spent their money on and they said their families. On educating their children and taking care of their health. On investing back into their businesses and hiring additional employees. Not one had spent the income on themselves.Families, communities and economies suffer when women are treated as unequal to men. Furthermore, without female role models for future generations of women, progress will not just stall -- it will reverse. Leveling the playing field -- where women and men have equal chances to become economically, socially and politically active, make decisions, and shape policies -- is likely to lead over time to more representative, and more inclusive, institutions and policy choices and thus to a better development path. In order for us to achieve real progress in development, gender equality must be a standalone goal. I am not alone in this view. There are many others who have been calling for the same for months. The OECD has called for women and girls to be front and center in the post-2015 framework. The Gender and Development Network has convened 85 of the UK's leading development NGOs and gender experts to ensure women's empowerment is promoted in the next framework. Their most recent report argues that the next framework must tackle the underlying causes of gender inequality to achieve sustainable change. U.N. Women have called for a goal that includes issues specifically about women, such as eliminating violence against women and girls, expanding women's choices and opportunities, ensuring their full participation in decision-making at all levels, and including targets and indicators that specifically relate to women. As the High-Level Panel on Post-2015 Development issue their recommendations, we must keep up the pressure. Women are at the heart of every family. They are the mothers, the carers, the managers, the peacemakers. But they can deliver so much more. As we look ahead to a new framework, we cannot afford to let gender equality slip off the world agenda. Our future depends on it. Give women equality of opportunity and the rest will follow.","With Millennium Development Goals to expire, U.N. High Level Panel will meet to discuss post-2015 goals .

"(CNN) -- Julie Quiroz, a 14-year-old U.S. citizen, has been separated from her mother for nearly two years. Her mom was deported to Mexico for being in the United States illegally. Julie Quiroz is one of an estimated 4 million ""citizen children"" in the United States, according to new study. At the age of 12, Julie was forced to decide between her country and her family. With the help of a Christian philanthropist, she chose to stay in the United States. ""It's really, really hard to leave your family,"" she told CNN by phone. A study issued Tuesday provides one of the most comprehensive looks at ""citizen children"" like Julie who are caught in the cross hairs of the nation's illegal immigration battle. Nearly 4 million children who have at least one parent who entered the U.S. illegally were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens as a result, according to the study conducted by the Pew Hispanic Center. That's about three quarters of the estimated 5.5 million children of illegal immigrants inside the United States, according to the study. About 1.8 million children of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, the study found. ""Among children whose parents are unauthorized immigrants, one in three is poor. The [poverty] rate of children of unauthorized immigrants is similar whether the children are unauthorized immigrants or U.S. born,"" the study says. Roughly 12 million illegal immigrants are in the United States -- about 4 percent of the nation's population. The study found that the majority of illegal immigrants, about 7 million, come from Mexico. Shuya Ohno with the Washington-based advocacy organization National Immigration Forum said the study underscores how the nation's immigration situation is ""not so simple."" ""This really highlights the fact that so many undocumented families are of mixed status -- that there is a U.S. citizen in the direct family,"" he said. Undocumented immigrants make up more than 5 percent of the U.S. work force, according to the study, based on March 2008 figures from the U.S. Census Bureau. The children of illegal immigrants make up an even greater share of students in America's primary and secondary schools, with nearly 7 percent enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade. That figure has jumped, from 5.4 percent in 2003. In states near Mexico's border -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada and Texas -- about 10 percent of the student population are the children of illegal immigrants. The study also found that these children are more likely to live in a two-parent home, compared with the rest of the nation. ""The vast majority of all children with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent live in two-parent families (80 percent),"" the study says. ""This is similar to the share of children of other immigrants who do so (84 percent) and higher than the share of children with U.S.-born parents (71 percent)."" The study comes as the Obama administration considers comprehensive immigration reform. Obama has supported a combination of enforcing laws and opening up the system. He wants to see a pass for citizenship that would mean having an illegal immigrant pay a fine, learn English and then get in line for citizenship. Critics refer to that ""path to citizenship"" as amnesty. In the case of Julie Quiroz, she was born in Washington state, lived there her entire life and went to school there. But her mother, Ana Reyes, entered the United States illegally before Quiroz was born and U.S. immigration officials deported her in 2007. Two of her brothers were also deported. Her 7-year-old sister, who is a U.S. citizen, is living in Mexico with her mother. ""She is getting no education or very little -- and pretty much has lost all of her English language skills for being out of the country now for almost two years. It's just awful,"" said Joe Kennard, the philanthropist who came to Julie's aid. Kennard formed a group called Organization to Help Citizen Children, which works with churches along the U.S.-Mexico border to provide support for children whose mother or father is deported to Mexico. Julie has been living with his family over the last year in Texas. He has urged Obama to issue an executive order to stay the deportation of any undocumented parent of a citizen child to prevent the separation of families. ""It's the only humane thing to do,"" he said. Immigration officials have long maintained they are simply enforcing the laws on the books and it's the fault of the parents for putting children into such a predicament by not following proper immigration channels. Julie, who first told her story to CNN last year, said she speaks to her mom nearly every day by phone and communicates with her via e-mail. ""I miss them a lot,"" she said. ""I mean big time!"" She last visited her family in Mexico City at Christmas. She said she hopes to  be a lawyer for immigrants one day ""to help make their dreams come true, to make a better life here."" Her message to citizen children: ""Stay strong. If they separate you from your family, you can still try to be together."" She added with a sigh, ""It's not right what they're doing -- separating families."" -- CNN's Thelma Gutierrez contributed to this report.","Pew Hispanic Center study: 3 in 4 ""illegal"" immigrant children are U.S. citizens .

"(CNN) -- An avalanche in northern Norway swept six French skiers down a mountain, killing at least two of them, police said Monday. ""We have located two dead people in the avalanche, and one has been dug out alive,"" Astrid Nilsen with the Troms Police District told CNN. ""We have also located three more avalanche pagers that we are working on digging out, but we are not sure that there will be anyone with them in case they lost their pagers in the avalanche."" Skiers carry pagers to help authorities locate them in such situations. Police, civilians and helicopters were involved in the search in the mountains of Djupvik in the community of Kafjord in Troms. ""It is a good weather here today so we are hopeful we'll find them,"" said Torstein Skogvang, a police spokesman. Authorities were notified around 2:30 p.m. (9.30 a.m. ET) of the avalanche, he said.

"(CNN) -- In the digital age, war isn't contained to the ground. The Israeli government on Sunday said it has been hit with more than 44 million cyberattacks since it began aerial strikes on Gaza last week. Anonymous, the hacker collective, claimed responsibility for taking down some sites and leaking passwords because of what it calls Israel's ""barbaric, brutal and despicable treatment"" of Palestinians. ""The war is being fought on three fronts,"" Carmela Avner, Israel's chief information officer, said on Sunday in a press release. ""The first is physical, the second is the world of social networks and the third is cyberattacks. ""The attackers are attempting to harm the accessibility of Israel's government websites on an ongoing basis. When events like the current operation occur, this sector heats up and we see increased activity. Therefore, at this time, defending the governmental computer systems is of invaluable importance."" Israel and the military wing of Hamas have been criticized for using ready-to-share images on social media to spread spin about the conflict, which has claimed the lives of about 100 Palestinians and three Israelis since the back-and-forth violence began again Wednesday. There is some dispute about the effectiveness of the cyberattacks. Israel says the attacks have largely been unsuccessful. ""We are reaping the fruits on the investment in recent years in the development of computerized defense systems, but we have a lot of work in store for us,"" Israel's finance minister, Yuval Steinitz, said in a written statement. Reuters quotes him as saying only one website was down for 10 minutes. CNN iReport: Instagram users wage peace in Israel . Anonymous, meanwhile, posted a list of more than 650 Israel-based websites it says it has taken down or defaced since last week. ""They've knocked down websites, deleted databases and have leaked e-mail addresses and passwords,"" Casey Chan wrote Friday for the tech site Gizmodo. ""It's a whopping takedown."" A post on an Anonymous Twitter feed Monday morning said another set of hackers had defaced the Israeli versions of several Microsoft websites, including Bing, MSN and Skype. Visitors to Bing's Israeli site on Monday morning saw an anti-Israel rant instead of a search-engine homepage. ""Microsoft is aware of the site defacements and working to get all sites fully functional,"" a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""At present, we have seen no evidence to suggest the compromise of customer information but will take action to help protect customers as necessary."" A page associated with Anonymous also posted a new threat: ""November 2012 will be a month to remember for the (Israel Defense Forces) and Internet security forces. Israeli Gov. this is/will turn into a cyberwar."" Some observers took this as a sign of an escalating digital battle. ""Beyond mere 'denial of service' tactics that blocked sites with floods of junk data, the hackers also ramped up their attacks to penetrations of any vulnerable target available to them, resulting in tens of thousands of Israeli citizens' and supporters' private data dumped onto the Web,"" wrote Andy Greenberg from Forbes. Others said most of Anonymous' threats have been ""hollow"" so far. ""Today, Anon lacks the talent and semi-cohesion it once boasted across the net, and its most recent online crusade is an embarrassing reminder,"" Sam Biddle wrote for Gizmodo on Monday. ""This is less a war than the hacker equivalent of egging someone's house and then smoking weed behind a Denny's."" The group is calling its campaign #OpIsrael. ""While the Israeli government almost certainly has backups of the aformentioned databases, these attacks as well as the defacements show Anonymous isn't just doing its usual spree of overloading target sites,"" writes another tech blog, TheNextWeb. ""OpIsrael appears to have gotten multiple hackers involved who are interested in doing actual damage, or at least something that is slightly more permanent than just a 404,"" which is the code that appears online when a website won't load. Greenberg, from Forbes, makes the important point that none of this digital damage compares to the loss of life on the ground in the Middle East. ""Anonymous' attacks, of course, hardly register compared with the physical damage inflicted by both sides in the Gaza conflict,"" he wrote.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Police arrested 11 people in central and northern Italy on Friday on suspicion of recruiting Kurds to join the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK -- the outlawed separatist group fighting for a homeland in southeastern Turkey. Of those arrested, 10 are Kurdish -- mostly from Turkey -- and one is an Italian with a criminal record, Italian authorities said. Searches related to 16 others are under way, according to police. This comes as a two-year investigation led to the dismantling of three camps in Italy and one in France to train recruits for the PKK. The camps in Italy were old, isolated farm houses. In one camp, authorities found 70 people being indoctrinated into the PKK. An investigation into their identifications is ongoing. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority, numbering more then 12 million people. For many years, the Turkish state denied their existence, calling them ""mountain Turks."" The PKK has been locked in a bloody conflict with Turkey since the 1980s, and more than 30,000 people, mostly ethnic Kurds, have been killed in the conflict. Full coverage in Turkish: CNN Turk . The international community, including the United States and the European Union, considers the PKK a terrorist organization. The rebel group continues to operate in Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq, and the Turkish military has in the past bombed PKK targets around Iraq's border with Turkey.

"(CNN) -- Norway's police are facing tough questions over their response to last Friday's terror attacks, in which 76 people died. First, Oslo was rocked by a huge blast outside government buildings, which left eight people dead. Less than two hours later, a gunman reached Utoya island, some 20 miles away, and proceeded to fire on the mostly teenage participants of a political summer camp for well over an hour. Reporters, particularly from the foreign press, have asked why it took an hour from the police first being alerted for armed officers to arrest the suspect, 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik. Among their questions have been why a helicopter was not used to take elite officers to the scene, rather than them travelling by road, and whether problems with a police boat -- which meant civilian vessels had to be commandeered -- delayed the response. Some have also asked whether the response to the bombing in the Norwegian capital took priority over the Utoya alert, with emergency phone operators and resources already tied up as frantic calls started to come in from young people under fire on the island. Sissel Hammer, chief of police for the Nordre Buskerud district, which covers Utoya, told reporters Wednesday that her officers and members of an elite police unit had done their best to get to the island quickly. ""I don't think we had any chance to be there faster than we made it,"" she said. Responding to the situation in Utoya was ""the highest priority"" for local police, and was not affected by events in Oslo, she said. Her staff had done a ""very demanding job"" both during and after the event, she added. At the same press conference, Haavard Gaasbakk, who was a commander on the scene, described how he grabbed his equipment and raced to the embarkation point for Utoya when the alarm was raised. A problem with the engine of the police boat meant the 10 or so emergency personnel who had met there had to take two privately owned motor boats instead, he said. However, these made the 700-meter crossing of the deep Tyrifjorden lake faster than the police boat would have done, he said. As they approached, the police heard ""a lot of shooting"" from the southern part of the wooded island, with gunshots ""coming fast and thick,"" Gaasbakk said. Officers ran toward the shooting and were about 350 meters away, in very difficult terrain, when they started to shout to the suspect, he said. Suddenly they saw him in front of them with his hands above his head and his weapons -- a rifle and an automatic pistol -- on the ground. The gunman was arrested by one officer as the others sought to find out of whether he was working alone and started to give first aid to a ""conveyor belt"" of the injured, Gaasbakk said. He spoke of his pride in the way police and local citizens rallied to help the injured. Hammer said an evaluation of the police response would be carried out later this year. A day earlier, police spokesman Johan Fredriksen rejected criticism of the police response to the massacre in Utoya. ""I don't think this could have gone faster,"" he said. ""I don't see how that would be possible with the distance and with these conditions. We always try to be better but I don't see how we could have done this faster."" He said the police had only one helicopter, which is kept at Gardemoen airfield north of Oslo, and that it would not have been suitable to transport a team of counter-terror officers from the capital to the scene. ""It took time to get the staff in. It was filled with irrelevant equipment for the purpose and has never been used for such operations,"" he said of the helicopter. ""I am of the opinion it would not have been any quicker to use it."" The former police inspector for Oslo, Finn Abrahamsen, told Norwegian reporters he felt it was a pity the helicopter was on the ground on the day of the attack. Anstein Gjengedal, of Oslo police district -- which pays for the national police helicopter service from its budget -- acknowledged it was flying less hours than it used to because of budget constraints. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg announced an independent commission of inquiry Wednesday, which he said would take an exhaustive look at what had happened and report back within a year on what lessons could be learned. But he rejected the suggestion that his country was naive and unready for potential attacks, saying Norway's security forces were aware of the danger of violent attacks and were prepared for them.

"(CNN) -- A former manager for the private contractor that provides guards for the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan said he tried to blow the whistle more than a year ago about inadequate staffing and improper behavior by guards, including going to brothels and sex trafficking. Images released by a watchdog group show raucous partying and sexual hazing by private embassy guards. James Gordon filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court Thursday claiming he was forced from his job illegally in February 2008 by ArmorGroup, North America (AGNA) -- a security contractor owned by Wackenhut Services Inc. Gordon said he asked the company and the U.S. State Department in investigate activities in Kabul by the company's guards, but there was no follow-up investigation. Gordon's suit, which seeks back pay and unspecified punitive damages, follows separate reports last week by a watchdog group that the contractor allowed mistreatment, sexual activity and intimidation within the ranks of private guards hired to protect the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan. A spokeswoman for Wackenhut at its Florida headquarters released a statement saying Gordon had resigned voluntarily and that his departure was not tied to whistleblowing nor was there retaliation by the company. ""We found that Mr. Gordon's factual allegations and legal claims were overstated, ill-founded, not based on any personal knowledge, or otherwise lacking in legal merit. We chose not to accede to the demands of Mr. Gordon and his lawyers and instead to let them present their case in court if they chose to do so,"" the Wackenhut statement said. Gordon spoke to a Washington news conference by telephone Thursday, saying he is working for another security firm in Kabul but declining to give any further details. Explaining his lawsuit, Gordon said, ""I set out two years ago to see to it that the U.S. Embassy in Kabul was protected. I am hoping that the public airing of this lawsuit will bring us closer to that goal."" Last week a watchdog group, the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), released photographs showing raucous partying and sexual hazing by private embassy guards. POGO sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and briefed reporters on its findings, which it said were based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul. In the wake of POGO's actions, the State Department said the behavior shown in the photos was ""disgusting"" and launched several investigations and said it had removed some of the private guards from the country. Meanwhile the same company continues to guard the U.S. Embassy, a contract worth more than $180 million a year. State Department Spokesman P.J Crowley said in his daily briefing in Washington that the department had ""aggressively overseen"" the contract for embassy guards and had issued nine so-called ""cure notices"" to correct specific deficiencies since the contract began in 2007. ""At no time was the security of the embassy ever threatened or compromised,"" Crowley said. But Gordon called the assertion ""ludicrous."" ""If you hire a guard force that is placing you at risk because of their behavior, and is also inadequate with regard to the fact of language difficulty between elements of the guard force, I don't see how anyone can say the government is getting what they are paying for and it doesn't compromise the integrity of the embassy itself,"" Gordon said, referring to reports that some of the private guards hired by the contractor were non-English-speaking Gurkhas from Nepal. ""If the guards can't communicate with each other, how are they going to communicate in a disaster? How are you going be able to properly respond to a scenario if you have to use pantomime to properly convey a message to a member of the security force? It is ludicrous for anyone to say that is a safe environment and an effective security force,"" Gordon said. Crowley said State Department officials had interviewed more than 150 guards since pictures were released last week by the watchdog group, and that a total of 16 people had been kicked out of the country. But Crowley would not comment on the new claims that private guards had patronized brothels and allegedly been involved in sex trafficking, with Crowley saying he would not discuss any matters that might be under litigation. In his lawsuit Gordon said one employee ""had to be forcibly removed from a brothel in Kabul during working hours."" Gordon said he tried to have that person dismissed but found other ArmorGroup personnel, including ""the AGNA medic and the program manager himself had frequented the brothels with him."" ""On the heels of this incident I learned that there had been an outbreak of sexually transmitted disease among AGNA guards in 2007 that had never been reported as required to the State Department, and that the guard force routinely frequented brothels,"" Gordon said Thursday. Gordon said the company resisted ""with outright hostility"" his efforts as a manager to impose a no-brothel policy. And Gordon said he asked both the company and the State Department to investigate whether guards were personally involved in sex trafficking, and that to his knowledge nothing was done. ""United States law, known as the Trafficking in Victims Protection Act, prohibits contractors from procuring commercial sex while working on the contract,"" Gordon said in a statement. ""Many of the prostitutes in Kabul are young Chinese girls who were taken against their will to Kabul for sexual exploitation."" Gordon said a trainee had boasted that he could purchase a girl for $20,000 and turn a profit after a month. ""I immediately notified both the State Department and AGNA's president, and urged the company to thoroughly investigate whether sex trafficking was occurring among the guard force ... To my knowledge neither AGNA nor the State Department conducted a follow-up investigation,"" Gordon said. Another former manager of guards in Afghanistan spoke with Gordon during the news conference. The second manager, John Gorman, is not involved in Gordon's lawsuit but said he wanted to highlight what he called fraud, deception and incompetence, as well as what he called ""sexually deviant behavior"" exhibited by people hired as guards in 2007. Gorman, who said he is a former U.S. Marine, also said he was forced out after he tried to spread the alarm about embassy security. ""Knowing full well that our jobs were on the line, we went to the embassy out of a sense of duty and patriotism,"" Gorman said. He said he went to the embassy to report problems after first complaining to ArmorGroup North America about what he called the company's ""inability to provide for the security and safety of the U.S. personnel."" ""In any interaction I have had with corporate officials from AGNA, no one -- no one -- ever mentioned or indicated a concern for the actual safety of the embassy. The greatest and only concerns were the profit margin,"" Gorman said.","Ex-manager sues firm he claims forced him from his job illegally after whistleblowing .

"(CNN) -- Tencent, the world's third largest Internet company by market share, launched its popular instant messenger service in English, Japanese and French. The launch of QQi Instant Messenger is an international version of its Chinese QQ instant messaging services, which has 600 million subscribers -- the largest instant messaging subscriber base in the world. Versions in Korean, Spanish and German are planned to be released early next year, a company spokesperson said. Tencent is also planning the release of its first English language social networking site in early 2011. Marc Violo, product manager for QQi, said the launch marks a tentative step toward bringing products from the hugely popular Chinese Internet company to an overseas audience. ""We have no intention of trying to compete with Skype or MSN instant messenger,"" Violo said. ""We're looking to expand our reach outside of China to get involved with people who are interested in China."" Already QQ has users in 212 countries, most of who come from the U.S. and Europe, Violo told CNN. Tencent has partnered with popular English-language web sites in China -- such as travel provider CTrip and state-run newspaper China Daily -- to draw more traffic from overseas consumers. ""And if you want to instant message someone living in China, you have access to 92 percent of the online population here,"" Violo said. The company is also working on a partnership with Canada-based StumbleUpon, a content discovery service company. QQi hopes to have ""between 7 and 10 million subscribers"" by September, Violo said. A beta version, released last year targeting expatriates living in China, has 2 million subscribers. Tencent is not the only Chinese Internet company with international ambitions. Baidu, China's largest search engine, launched a search service in Japan several years ago. The company has plans to expand into other regions, including Latin America, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, according to Baidu spokesperson Kaiser Kuo. ""We are looking at markets where Google is not dominant,"" Kuo said. ""Our preference is for markets with languages that are not Latin-based, so we have a leg up there."" In November, Baidu CEO Robin Li said he hoped that in 10 years, the Chinese search giant would become a household name in 50 percent of the world. With Chinese Internet companies' plans to do business abroad also come challenges that analysts say they are unsure China's domestic web giants will ultimately ever be able to overcome. The obstacles relate to the Internet censorship policies inside China that require companies to monitor and remove sensitive content from websites and block user behavior deemed inappropriate, political or otherwise. ""This is one of the key issues for all of these really rich Chinese Internet companies trying to go overseas,"" Bill Bishop, a Beijing-based independent media consultant, said. ""When they go into developing markets, it is one thing (because) there is a less sophisticated user base. When they go into the United States, they are carrying a huge amount of baggage and Google added a few tons to that baggage last year."" Read more on Google in China . Companies, like Tencent, have no choice but to follow Chinese Internet law or be shut down. Tencent, for example, blocks chats or posts containing sensitive words from its servers. ""For sure, I think all of the chats are monitored by QQ,"" Lu Gang, co-founder of OpenWeb.Asia, a working group focusing on the Asian Internet industry. ""If you type in sensitive key words, the messaging will be blocked. I think more and more people realize the problem, but still no one will give up QQ because it is part of the Internet culture in China. If you are not using it, you will lose lots of contacts in your social life.""

"(CNN) -- The editor in chief of a newspaper in Benghazi, Libya, was shot and killed Monday morning, the latest in a recent campaign of killings across the city. Muftah Buzeid was also a prominent analyst who frequently appeared on TV talk shows speaking out against Islamist extremism. His last such appearance was Sunday night. Many Libyans are outraged over the killing, which is likely to add to the support for renegade Gen. Khalifa Haftar and his campaign against terrorism. The deaths have mainly targeted security forces but also activists, journalists and judges. The city has been almost emptied of Westerners as diplomatic missions shut after the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate that killed American Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Officials and many residents blame the violence on Islamist extremist groups that have grown in size and influence since the 2011 revolution that overthrew longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. A weak central government has not been able to secure Benghazi or bring the perpetrators of the near-daily attacks to justice. Ten days ago, Haftar launched a surprise ground and air assault on Islamist militia positions and bases in Benghazi, including attacks on Ansar al-Sharia, the group blamed in the U.S. Consulate attack.","Muftah Buzeid frequently spoke against Islamic extremism .

"(CNN) -- Soccer and technology don't normally mix; FIFA, the international football body, has long dragged its studded heels over efforts to introduce microchip sensors into match refereeing. So when Japan based its entire World Cup 2022 bid on a dazzling display of computer wizardry that doesn't yet exist, it was taking a gamble. Japan, which is vying with Australia, Qatar, South Korea and the United States for the 2022 tournament, will find out on December 2 whether its ambitious proposal paid off. But any sense of victory will be tempered by the Herculean task the country now faces in trying to turn a package of ideas, which appear to be stolen wholesale from science fiction, into science fact. At the heart of Japan's bid is a plan to broadcast entire games to stadiums on the other side of the world in what appears to be life-sized holograms. Promotional videos shown on the 2022 bid website show ghostly players chasing the ball while crowds of fans look on -- reminiscent of the classic Princess Leia hologram scene in ""Star Wars."" Japanese organizers say each game will be filmed by 200 high definition cameras, which will use ""freeviewpoint"" technology to allow fans to see the action unfold from a player's eye view -- the kind of images until now only seen in video games. Meanwhile on the terraces, supporters will be able to use in-ear computerized translators to talk freely to fans from other countries -- a device that mimics the ""Star Trek's"" universal translators or the Babel Fish of ""Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" ""We think that now it's time to give something back to the world, and our starting point is to deliver the joy of football not only to the hosting country but all over the world,"" says Suminori Gokoh, director of the 2022 bid committee. But can Japan actually deliver on these fantastic promises? And will they really enhance the enjoyment of what is already known as the beautiful game? With limited information on how they intend to achieve their goals, leading scientists in the field of three dimensional and holographic television have been left slightly perplexed over the proposals. ""The 'freeviewpoint' is definitely going to be feasible, there's a lot of work being done on that,"" said Phil Surman, a scientist working on 3D television projects at Britain's De Montfort University in Leicester. ""But the rest is rather speculative."" While 3D broadcasts that don't rely on special glasses (known as auto-stereoscopic television) are currently possible, these involve projecting twin images directly at individuals. Viewers must remain in one spot or wear tracking devices to ensure the images are beamed at them. Says Surman, while this is possible for small groups, it's tricky on a larger scale. ""I really can't see how that can be done,"" he told CNN. Professor John Watson, a 3D television expert at Aberdeen University, agreed it was unlikely on a large scale. ""There has to be head tracking, so if you move your head the images has to move with you and you're not going to keep your head in position during a football match -- you're going to jump up and down, particularly if your home team scores. ""There's also an obstacle with nausea, some people looking at these autostereoscopic displays can become disorientated, there are human factors like that which have to be taken into account."" Professor Nasser Peyghambarian, whose team at the University of Arizona recently succeeded in producing rudimentary moving holographic images, is more optimistic. ""This is very aggressive planning, but I actually like it because they put a stick in the ground. But they are proposing something that doesn't exist right now and they're proposing to do it in 12 years,"" he told CNN. ""I believe it is achievable, The only question that remains to me is is it going to be affordable to the public?"" But what will the fans think? Says Jonathan Wilson, football obsessive and author of ""Inverting the Pyramid: A History of Football Tactics,"" they'll love it, but only if they really care about the game. ""Speaking as a tactics geek, the problem watching games on television is it's very hard to see the shape of the teams so if you're trying to assess the way the game's going, if you're trying to assess the space, how a team's shape's doing and their defense and organization, then this will clearly be beneficial. ""Whether most fans will care about this I don't know."" While real-time language interpretation might be more achievable given that computers are already capable of handling basic translations, linguists speculate they could have trouble handling football's unique vernacular. Says Damian Fitzpatrick, who runs a language website that focuses on the phraseology of football, the idioms deployed by fans are often baffling to speakers of the same language. ""Some of my north American colleagues have difficulty with certain football phrases such as 'early doors;' 'gatecrash the top four' and, of course, why is it that parrots are the sickest of all creatures?"" he told CNN. Despite the ambitious scope of the 2022 proposal, there is one problem that not even Japan's scientists have come up with a solution to: how to silence to Vuvuzela.","Japan says it will broadcast World Cup 2022 games in ""full court"" 3D .

"(CNN) -- Libya's National Transitional Council handed over power Wednesday to the General National Congress, the national assembly formed by last month's elections. The ceremony in a conference center in Tripoli marked the country's first peaceful government transition since before Moammar Gadhafi seized power in 1969. Wednesday's event was held on the 20th day of Ramadan, a date chosen to mark the anniversary of the start of the liberation of the capital city from Gadhafi's grip. Gadhafi's son seeks travel ban waiver, lawyer says . NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil and the oldest member of the body, Mohammed Ali Salim, signed documents marking the event. Jalil then walked to the microphone and announced that the NTC had handed over the ""constitutional powers of running the country"" and that the GNC was, from that moment, the ""sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people."" As he spoke, the crowd rose to its feet and broke out in cheers, with some chanting ""Allahu Akbar!"" (""God is Great!"") Others chanted a line that had become famous during the revolution: ""The blood of martyrs will not go wasted!"" Many cried at the empowerment of the new assembly, which represents the country's first body formed in a free and fair election in more than 47 years. Interim Prime Minister Abdul Rahim al-Kib appeared moved as he hugged Jalil. The special representative of the secretary general of the United Nations to Libya, Ian Martin, smiled as Jalil announced the handover. Members of the 200-person body took the oath of office en masse, and Jalil told them what they already knew: they face major challenges in security and disarmament. Militias who helped oust Gadhafi continue to operate without government oversight, still hold thousands of detainees and continue to carry out arbitrary detentions. Libya rebels move onto Syrian battlefield . On Sunday, unknown individuals attacked the residence of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Misrata. None of the seven staff members inside the building at the time of the attack was hurt, but the building suffered extensive damage, the ICRC said in a statement. The attack marked the fifth in less than three months against the ICRC in Misrata and Benghazi and led Ishfaq Muhamed Khan, the head of the ICRC's delegation in Libya, to suspend operations in those two cities. In addition, a bomb exploded Saturday in central Tripoli in what officials said was a local dispute. And last week, a bomb exploded near a security headquarters building in Benghazi. Officials reported defusing two other bombs around that time, including one found in the basement of the Tibesti Hotel, which is frequented by government officials, foreign delegations and nationals. It was not clear when the GNC's first official meeting would be held. One of its first jobs will be to elect a speaker and deputies. It will have 30 days from its first official session to appoint a prime minister. It is also tasked with overseeing the drafting of a constitution.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Consumer technology giants are battling to provide the place where you store your files, and Apple is not about to be left out. Capping a slew of software announcements on Monday, Apple unveiled iCloud. The free service lets users synchronize documents, photos and applications between Apple devices over the Internet. Music purchased through the iTunes Store can be downloaded from any device connected to your account, and for an annual fee, tracks bought from other stores, ripped from CDs or procured through other means can be synchronized. When iCloud drops this fall, Apple will join Amazon.com and Google, two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services. For music, Apple has the incumbent's advantage. ITunes is the world's most popular jukebox software, highest-volume music retailer and already has cozy ties to the record industry. That relationship enabled Apple to secure the deals that competitors are still negotiating for. Those agreements resulted in iTunes Match, which was Apple CEO Steve Jobs' signature ""one more thing"" to end his presentation on Monday. (""It's a small thing,"" he said.) ITunes Match will allow people to pay $25 per year to sync as many as 25,000 songs not purchased through the iTunes Store between their computers and gadgets. ""It takes minutes, not weeks,"" Jobs said. The weeks-long process Jobs is referring to is the offerings from Amazon and Google. Because they haven't secured rights with the record labels, they took an alternate route with their services. Amazon's Cloud Drive and Google's Music Beta require users to upload their entire libraries to each service before they can be accessed from Web and mobile jukeboxes. Apple, instead, uses a ""scan-and-match"" procedure, finding which of your songs are also sold in the iTunes Store and giving you the keys to access those. For the remainder of live recordings and other obscure songs you have, the system uploads them, just like other services do, but at a fraction of the time. ""We think we've got a great system here,"" Jobs said. ""This is the first time we've seen this in the music industry."" Music files bought from Amazon can be automatically stored in a user's Cloud Drive. Google does not have a music store. Cloud Drive offers 5 gigabytes (about 1,000 songs) free, and provides an extra 20 gigabytes for a year to customers who buy an album from Amazon's MP3 Store. Each gigabyte after that costs $1. Google's Music service is free this year if you can procure an invitation to join, and Google has not announced pricing for after that. Apple's iCloud provides 5 gigabytes at no charge for e-mail, documents and backup file storage. Music, books, apps and pictures don't count against that total. ICloud will only store photos for 30 days. Apple did not say how much it will cost to lease Internet hard-drive space after filling up on e-mail and such. ""We want people to see what these devices can really do and what the software can do. So we're making it free,"" Jobs said. Amazon's Cloud Drive can also store photos and video, but those files do count against a user's total. Amazon has e-book and app stores that provide similar syncing features as part of the package, but it doesn't offer e-mail. Google breaks its offerings up into a series of applications and storage lockers. Music Beta is currently storing 20,000 songs free. Gmail provides 7.6 gigabytes of free storage and sells more. Google Docs can keep a gigabyte of files free and charges 25 cents for each extra gigabyte. Picasa Web Albums has an equivalent pricing scheme for photos. Google also has an e-book store and has begun offering video services beyond YouTube for home movies. Microsoft also offers e-mail and document storage. Apple has integrated iCloud tightly into the mobile and computer systems it makes, starting with Mac OS X Lion and iOS 5, which debut next month and in the fall, respectively. Files are saved and pushed to Apple's servers automatically. Apple will also have websites for accessing e-mail, calendar and other features, as well as allowing Windows-PC users to sync photos to a folder. Don't bet on seeing apps for Google's Android phones or for BlackBerrys. Apple has tried this sort of thing before with MobileMe, which cost $99 per year and was less ambitious in scale. It was viewed as a flop and experienced some embarrassing outages. Shortly after the launch of the now three-year-old Web service, Jobs assembled the team who developed it and told them: ""You've tarnished Apple's reputation,"" according to a story in Fortune magazine. Jobs acknowledged the failure humbly and with good humor on Monday. ""Why should I believe them? They're the ones that brought me to MobileMe,"" Jobs said, mimicking the potential response to iCloud from critics. ""It wasn't our finest hour. Let me just say that. But we learned a lot."" Amazon and Google have a proven track record in delivering vast amounts of information over the Web. But Jobs says Apple is ready this time. ""If you don't think we're serious about this, you're wrong,"" he said, before transitioning to pictures of a massive facility Apple built in Maiden, North Carolina: ""This is our third data center that we just completed. ... It's rather large.""","Apple is preparing to launch iCloud, an Internet storage service .
Amazon already has Cloud Drive, and Google has a variety of services .
iCloud is tightly integrated into Apple software but seemingly less so in other platforms ."
"(CNN) -- The most influential show in the history of television never finished a season among the 20 most popular programs in the Nielsen ratings. In its most popular season, ""Hill Street Blues,"" which ran from 1981 to 1987, came in 21st place. And yet, according to a group of veteran TV critics and college professors who study the media, it was the TV series that most changed the direction of television programming. Meanwhile, other series such as ""ER"" and ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" both monster hits that were the most popular shows in several seasons, failed to get even one mention from the panel of a dozen professional TV watchers queried by CNN. In all, 46 shows were cited as having a strong influence on TV but none was mentioned as often as ""Hill Street Blues."" That NBC series ""paved the way for TV drama to grow up and be truly adult,"" said Matt Roush, TV critic at TV Guide Magazine. It was ""the prototype for a serious complex view of inner-city crime,"" added Elayne Rapping, professor of American studies and media studies at the State University of New York. Others cited its large diverse cast at a time when this was a rarity and said it laid the groundwork for complex network dramas. Here are the next most influential shows chosen by the panel: . 2. (tie) ""I Love Lucy"" This is the show that pioneered the multicamera approach to situation comedies, said Ken Tucker, TV critic for Entertainment Weekly. It created ""the template for all sitcoms to come,"" added Neal Justin of the StarTribune in Minneapolis. 2. (tie) ""The Sopranos"" Up until it got on the air, ""nobody had ever tried to make a show in which the protagonist was not merely unsympathetic, but actually evil,"" said Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald. ""Now, from 'Dexter' to 'Sons of Anarchy,' it's a common practice."" 4. ""The Tonight Show"" Whether with Steve Allen or Johnny Carson, it ""established the model for late-night talk comedy programming still in use today,"" said Robert J. Thompson, professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University. 5. (tie) ""All in the Family"" It set a standard for sitcoms because ""it managed to mirror all the tensions and contradictions, both essential and timely, of life in America while it boldly addressed a time of great political change,"" said Mary McNamara, TV critic for the Los Angeles Times. 5. (tie) ""Survivor"" Though it premiered in the summer, said Mark Dawidziak of the Plain Dealer in Cleveland, its huge success ""led to the reality boom of the last 12 years and paved the way for series like 'American Idol' and 'Dancing With the Stars.' "" 7. (tie) ""The Cosby Show"" Not only was this the top-rated show for five consecutive seasons but panelists give it credit for reviving the situation comedy and for being the first series to feature a family headed by black professionals. 7. (tie) ""60 Minutes"" This long-running show finished in first place for three consecutive seasons, establishing the format for all TV newsmagazines to come. Meanwhile, says Dave Walker of the Times-Picayune in New Orleans, ""it inadvertently turned TV news from a public service into a profit center."" 7. (tie) ""Friends"" Panel members praised its fresh approach to ensemble comedy, which looked deceptively simple. ""It made network executives think that any show built around five or six attractive people would be a hit,"" said Maureen Ryan, TV critic for AOL. 10. (tie) ""The Today Show"" It invented morning television and woke up network executives to the profit potential at that time of day. 10. (tie) ""American Idol"" Though TV had amateur talent shows before, such as ""Star Search"" and ""Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts,"" this series demonstrated the enormous potential of the genre. Several panelists gave a nod to MTV's ""Real World"" for creating the modern reality show in which nonactors are placed in pre-planned situations. Other shows receiving honorable mention for their influence on the TV industry: ""M*A*S*H,"" ""The Simpsons,"" ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show,"" ""Law & Order,"" ""Lost,"" ""Your Show of Shows,"" ""The Milton Berle Show,"" ""Sesame Street,"" ""The Shield,"" ""American Bandstand"" and the UK original version of ""The Office.""

"(CNN) -- An Indiana man is demanding a direct apology from a Transportation Security Administration agent in Florida who, the man says, spilled his grandfather's ashes during an airport bag check and then laughed off the incident. And John Gross is also demanding that the TSA release any security surveillance tapes of the incident, tapes that the federal agency said simply don't exist. Gross, 30, was returning home from visiting family in Orlando, Florida, on June 19, carrying with him a portion of his grandfather's ashes that had been passed along by an uncle -- a ""real sentimental kind of guy,"" said Gross -- when he approached TSA screeners. A female agent wearing blue latex gloves inspected the contents of his bag, says Gross, including the jar clearly labeled ""Human Remains."" Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' ""I said, 'Please be careful, these are my grandpa's ashes,'"" Gross told CNN Wednesday. But, he said, the agent proceeded to stick her finger in the jar then accidentally spilled its contents on the airport floor. She then laughed, according to Gross, not an uproarious cackle, but a chuckle that he found offensive nonetheless. ""She thought it was funny,"" he said. ""I wanted to smack her."" While not directly contradicting Gross, the TSA said it believes his sequence of events is incorrect. Triumphs and woes: A timeline of the TSA's evolution . ""Our initial review concluded that the circumstances as described in some reports are inconsistent with what we believe transpired,"" an initial statement from the TSA said. That pronouncement prompted Gross, who said he would otherwise be content to drop his contention, to once again assail the agency. ""I don't want this to continue,"" he said Wednesday in an interview with CNN, but ""now I'm really heated because the TSA is coming back and saying there's inconsistencies in the reports."" Report: TSA security breaches mishandled . The TSA statement added that ""under no circumstances should a container holding remains be opened."" ""TSA recognizes the importance of screening human remains with utmost respect and dignity while remaining vigilant of our security mission to protect the traveling public,"" its statement said. TSA spokesman David Castelveter said Tuesday that there is no surveillance video relevant to the episode, and the agency followed that on Wednesday by adding that the security cameras in question are being upgraded. Gross, however, said he believes the agency is concealing the truth. ""If they don't have any tapes, it obviously shows they are hiding something,"" he told CNN. The situation calmed later Wednesday, after Gross said he received what he viewed as a ""sincere"" and ""heartfelt"" apology from a TSA administrator, but he was still bothered by the federal agency's public declaration that his story had ""inconsistencies"" with what the TSA said happened. And he still wanted ""the apology from the person who did it ..."" As for the spilled ashes of his grandfather, Gross said he did the best he could to recover as much as possible. ""I couldn't get a broom and dust pan, but I picked up the bigger pieces on the ground and I put them in the jar,"" Gross said. ""But not everything.

"Detroit (CNN) -- A Nigerian man accused of attempting to detonate an explosive device in his underwear aboard a Christmas 2009 flight to Detroit will head to trial on October 4, a federal judge said Tuesday. Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab was ordered to attend the Tuesday afternoon hearing in U.S. District Court in Michigan, despite the his efforts to not appear. In September, AbdulMutallab told U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds he did not want to be represented by the public defenders assigned to his case and wanted to act as his own lawyer. Edmunds agreed, but appointed a standby counsel for him in case he needs help. Last week, AbdulMutallab's standby lawyer requested that the suspect not attend Tuesday's hearing. ""As long as (the) defendant chooses to represent himself in this matter, he must appear at court for all proceedings,"" Edmunds wrote in her court order. AbdulMutallab has been indicted on charges that include attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. He was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route to Detroit from the Netherlands on Christmas Day 2009. According to an indictment, he went into a restroom shortly before the plane was to land, and when he returned to his seat he said his stomach was upset and pulled a blanket over himself. Prosecutors allege he then tried to ignite an explosive device that was hidden in his underwear. Passengers and flight crew members subdued him. U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt.
