"By . Hugo Gye . One of golf's most prestigious tournaments could be under threat after a group of travellers started living on the course where it will take place in a few weeks. Seven caravans and a handful of vans were today parked at the entrance to the Royal Aberdeen Golf Club, which is set to host July's Scottish Open. The event will feature some of the sport's biggest stars, including Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickelson, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood. Camp: A group of travellers is parked at the Royal Aberdeen Golf Club, where the Scottish Open will take place . However, one local councillor suggested that it might take months to move the travellers on, because the owners of the course must obtain a court order first. 'They have pitched up on one of the most prestigious golf courses in the world and all because they know there's nothing we can do about it,' said councillor Willie Young. 'We are doing everything possible to attract the best tournaments and the best players to the north-east. 'What message does this send to people when you see caravans at the front door? The travellers are actually now laughing at us because they know we can't do anything to stop them.' Travellers: The club has applied for a court order to move the trespassers on from its land . Venue: The Scottish Open will be hosted by the venerable club in July . Police said they visited the site after the travellers first arrived yesterday morning, but they are unable to move them on because they are on private land. The golf club has applied for a court order to force the travellers to leave, but insists that the Scottish Open will go ahead as planned. However golfer Douglas Ibbotson, who has worked as a caddy during professional competitions at the club, expressed concerns that the camp could affect the club's future. Stars: Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson are among the golfers set to play at the Scottish Open . 'I think the Scottish Open will go ahead but it's not good for the area and there's a possibility it could disrupt the event and put a downer on the golf,' he said. 'Having travellers in the area has been terrible with lots of waste getting left all over the place very close to where I live. 'I'm massively excited for such a big event to be held in the area and if the traveller site prevents it from coming back it would such a shame.'","Seven caravans and vans are parked at the Royal Aberdeen Golf Club .

Yesterday, . senior officers at Cowcaddens Fire Station described the battle to save . the building. Initially, two people were reported missing, so . firefighters were sent to search. But once it was established they were safe, a rearguard operation to stop the blaze spreading and save the artefacts began. Assistant . Chief Fire Officer David Goodhew said: ‘It is always difficult fighting . a fire in a Grade 1-listed buildings as the priority is always to try . and preserve the structure. ‘The Art School was always going to present us with a challenge and we knew it would be a hugely complex challenge. Better safety: A state-of-the-art suppression system in the Mackintosh building was scheduled for completion by the end of summer . Taking care: The salvage operation continued, with the sight of each surviving treasure greeted with delight . Valuable: Concerns had previously been raised over fire safety issues within the historic building, especially as it had so many priceless works of art . Reconstruction: It has been confirmed replica studios will be built so students' degree projects can be reproduced exactly as they were before the fire . ‘It is not a building designed with . fire safety in mind and the things that  make it so attractive, like the . wooden panels, offer firefighters a significant challenge. 'The bravery of the crews involved was just remarkable.

Despite the complexity of the building, fire crews knew every detail of the interior due to years of planning. The GSA is listed as a top priority in terms of firefighting and senior officers have spent years building a 3-D profile, so they knew exactly where to go. Area Commander Paul Tanzilli said: ‘There was more a risk with this one, but we immediately decided to set up a human shield to contain the fire to the West Wing. ‘The bravery of the crews involved was just remarkable. They never flinched.’ Group Commander Iain Goodlet said: ‘I had a quick look inside to assess where the fire had taken hold and then ordered the firefighters in. ‘It was a question of getting the right resources in terms of staff and equipment and containing the blaze. 'When you are dealing with a building of such historic importance it is always more difficult.’ Work to install a bespoke fire prevention system had been due to restart within days, the Glasgow School of Art has revealed. A state-of-the-art suppression  system in the Mackintosh building was scheduled for completion by the end of summer. Attempts to install it had to be halted last year after workmen discovered asbestos in the A-listed structure. Work had to be abandoned as students were due to return to their studies and could not be put at risk. Up in flames: Firefighters tackle a blaze at the iconic Charles Rennie Mackintosh building last Friday . Yesterday, the school confirmed it had raised the funding for the fire suppression project through the generosity of donations from art lovers around the world. The tailor-made scheme had been designed to help extinguish any blaze within a matter of minutes, although a spokesman admitted it was ‘tragically ironic’ given Friday’s blaze. She insisted there was no way of knowing if the new system would have ultimately made a difference and prevented the spread of the fire. It is understood the new system would not have involved sprinklers, for fear they could have been  accidentally set off, posing an even greater threat from water damage. Blaze: Fire crews tackle a major fire at the Glasgow School of Art. The school stated that everyone in the building escaped to safety and there were no reports of any casualties . Concerns had previously been raised over fire safety issues within the historic building, especially as it had so many priceless works of art. Art impresario Richard Demarco said: ‘Having spent £55million on a new building, they should have spent whatever it takes to get a sprinkler system in the Mackintosh building before now. ‘Every square inch should have been safeguarded and it’s inexcusable if penny-pinching got in its way.’ It has been confirmed replica studios will be built so students’ degree projects can be reproduced exactly as they were before the fire. Artist and former GSA student Peter Graham arrived at the scene yesterday with a gold covered book to gather the thoughts of those affected by the events.

But this store is actually a charity shop, which opened its doors yesterday in Stockton-on-Tees with the promise that it is unlike all other charity shops in the area. Daisy Chain sells a range of goods, including furniture, clothes and books while raising cash for the charity of the same name, which supports children with autism and their families. Scroll down for video . The upmarket Daisy Chain charity store in Stockton-on-Tees, which boasts its own coffee shop . The shop operates on a plush split level and sells quality second hand furniture as well as clothes and books . The idea to open the shop came from the chair of the charity's trustees, Albert Dicken, one time managing director of the Dickens Home Improvement chain . Opening the shop was the idea of the charity's chair of trustees, Albert Dicken, the one-time managing director of the Dickens Home Improvement chain. Charity chief executive Judith Haysmore said: 'We are going for the experience. 'We have a coffee shop and it doesn’t smell like a charity shop and it doesn’t feel like one. 'Our tag line is shop, donate, volunteer. We are hoping that people will come along and donate something, buy something, have a coffee and a think about volunteering to help local families. Proceeds raised from the shop will go towards the Daisy Chain charity, which supports children with autism and their families . 'The charity needed a sustainable income so we can still be there for the parents supporting them - I also think it will raise a lot of awareness about autism.' The store sells a wide range of secondhand goods as well as some new items. Shoppers are able to purchase sofas, dining room furniture and even wallpaper as well as other household accessories such as cushions, mirrors and clocks. There is even items for the garden such as patio sets and barbecues. The . volunteers who work in the Daisy Chain superstore with store manager .

One of the first customers in the store was Julie Brookes, 45, whose son Ian has been helped by the charity. He suffers from Aspergers Syndrome, a form of autism, which affects how suffers react in social situations. Mrs Brookes said: 'I think the store is fantastic - and the money raised is going to such a good cause.' Upmarket charity shops such as this one in Stockton-on-Tees are on the rise, with the number of charity shops rising by 30 per cent since 2008 . The number of charity shops in Britian has increased by 30 per cent since 2008 and they have performed well financially against other High Street shops. More and more stores are sprucing up their shop floors to give themselves more of a boutique or superstore feel to draw in customers. In some stores, gone are the disorganised rails of old clothes and piles of books as they have been replaced with bright, modern interiors with some even selling one-off vintage items and unwanted designer goods. Last year, David and Victoria Beckham donated more than 20 boxes of clothes, bags and shoes to the Red Cross charity shop in Chelsea in London to support the Typhoon Haiyan appeal. Shoppers wanting to get their hands on some of the couple's old designer clothes queued around the block in a bid to buy some of their unwanted items. In addition, the charity Oxfam has eight shops, which they describe as boutiques, selling one-off, sometimes vintage clothes to help their cause. Retail guru Mary Portas also took on charity shops in one of her TV series saying they needed to become 'less smelly' if they were to help revive the High Street. Ms Portas, helps to runs 11 stores for Save the Children, agreed that charity shops had a ‘vital role’ to play saving the high street. And last year she said: 'If you create a charity shop that is a beautiful, respectful place people will give you great stuff and actually respect it in a better way, which in turn makes more money for charity.'","Daisy Chain sells quality second hand furniture and even has a coffee shop .

"By . Carl Markham . World Cup organisers insist an incomplete roof at Sao Paulo's Itaquerao Stadium will not affect it hosting matches when the tournament begins in June. Constructors completing the project have admitted they will not finish the intended design until after the tournament but the event's local organising committee have stressed this will not be a problem. The Itaquerao Stadium will host the opening match between Brazil and Croatia on June 12 before England face Uruguay there a week later. Unfinished busniness: The roof at the San Paulo's Itaquero Stadium will not be completed before the World Cup . On Sunday it underwent its final test by staging a Brazilian league match between Corinthians and Figueirense, which was affected by rain and hail storms forcing those among the restricted crowd of 40,000 not under cover of the roof to seek shelter elsewhere. 'The only aspect of the roof which will be unfinished is the inner liner, not impacting the effective protection of the stands,' said the local organising committee in a statement to Press Association Sport. 'A glass finishing will also not be concluded, which similarly does not jeopardise the effectiveness of the roof. It's a riot! Protests near the stadium continue after spiralling costs saw the budget grow from £35m to £320m . 'It is important to highlight that there is no obligation, neither from FIFA nor from the local organising committee, that FIFA World Cup stadia offer roofs protecting 100 per cent of the stands. 'Therefore, the architectural design of Arena de Sao Paulo, as well as of all other 11 stadia, does not guarantee that all the public will be immune to rain, which would be possible only in indoor arenas. 'Likewise, it was never foreseen in the project that the complementary stands had roofs.""' A league match was also held at Arena Pantanal in the western city of Cuiaba on Sunday, meaning all venues have now undergone pre-tournament tests. Couldbe a Suar point: Roy Hodgson's England play Luis Suarez's Uruguay at the Itaquerao Stadium on June 12 . The Itaquerao Stadium, which will have a capacity of nearly 70,000 when it holds the tournament opener, has been dogged by problems since construction, the cost of which has rocketed from £95million to an estimated £320million, began in 2011. Earlier this year a worker died while installing some of the 20,000 temporary seats required for the opening game, prompting officials to briefly halt construction after two previous fatalities at the venue late last year when a crane collapsed. While the stadium itself is now operational, reports suggest there is a lot of work still do to outside the venue in relation to infrastructure.","The roof at Sao Paulo's Itaquerao Stadium will not be completed before the World Cup starts .

The barn is approached from oak electric gates leading to a gravelled driveway, and its Indian stone patio includes an eight person jacuzzi spa tub. Snape Castle was first built in 1426 when Ralph de Neville, fourth Lord Neville, gave it to his younger son, George Neville, first Lord Latimer. It was for a brief period owned by King Richard III in the 15th century, while the heir Richard, second Lord Latimer, was still a child. Most of the castle is now in ruins, but there are two private residences in the South Wing.

Neville, the third Lord Latimer, in 1534. Her . first marriage, to Edward Borough, had ended with his death in 1533 - . and she became a widow again when Lord Latimer died in 1542. She then left Snape Castle and became King Henry VIII's sixth wife the following year – but he then died in 1547. Soon after she married her fourth husband Thomas Seymour. But she died after childbirth aged 36 in 1548 in Gloucestershire. Catherine was step-mother to Henry's children Edward, Mary and Elizabeth. When her only biological child, a daughter with Seymour, was born in 1548 she named her Mary in honour of her step-daughter. She has been credited with campaigning tirelessly for the restoration of the line of succession in the new Act of Succession of 1544. It allowed Mary, then Elizabeth, to take the throne after their brother Edward.","Property on grounds of the 15th century Snape Castle near Bedale in North Yorkshire boasts 4,000 sq ft of space .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The FA are fully behind UEFA’s intention to put up a candidate to fight Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency in next year’s election. English football’s ruling body believe anything is better than Blatter, 78, being handed a fifth term in office and will support whoever UEFA decide should stand. The FA stance is similar to their position during the last FIFA election in 2011, when former FA chairman David Bernstein stood alone in making a congress speech opposing Blatter standing alone for the presidency. Out! The FA are behind UEFA¿s intention to put up a candidate to fight Sepp Blatter . Blatter, who is likely to announce he wants to carry on at the FIFA congress in Sao Paulo after receiving stage-managed endorsements from a number of confederation leaders, is almost certain to win with many votes already in the bag. But if, as expected, UEFA chief Michel Platini doesn’t stand, several credible Europeans are said to be prepared to take on Blatter. The FA, England and St George’s Park management all give a stock answer to the lack of use by the national team of their £100million training centre outside Burton. They are there for two days in the World Cup build-up. The glib excuse is that SGP was not meant just for the senior side but constructors Bowmer & Kirkland, who built the state-of-the-art facility, are among those perplexed at its lack of use by the squad. League Two play-off losers Burton, on the other hand, are at SGP four times a week. ....................................................................... Certain blazers on the FA international committee have accompanied England for entire tournaments. But this summer chairman Ivan Gazidis, aware of his Arsenal commitments, will be in Brazil for only a short period, as will Tottenham’s Darren Eales. Committee men Robert Coar, David Barnard, Peter Barnes, Keith Lamb and Barry Taylor will rotate duties between Miami and Rio.   ....................................................................... Relationships between the FA and the Premier League are always strained and the sexist emails saga will only add to that. David Gill, a Premier League representative on the FA, made it clear at a special meeting before the FA council last week how annoyed he was about FA independent director Heather Rabbatts saying in public that PL chief executive Richard Scudamore should ‘consider his position’. Rabbatts could hardly remain silent when she chairs the FA inclusion board, whose members had been the most vocal on the affair. Rabbatts has now been mandated by chairman Greg Dyke to lead for the FA on inclusion discussions with Scudamore. The PL are still considering whether to complain to the police over temporary secretary Rani Abraham selling the email exchanges involving Scudamore and lawyer Nick West to the Sunday Mirror. They have the backing of clubs to do so. It is thought Abraham viewed as many as 900 emails in Scudamore’s personal premierleague.com account.    ...................................................................... Jose’s a no-show... Jose Mourinho and his excitable Chelsea assistant Rui Faria were due to attend the Championship play-off and had seats reserved at the pre-match lunch in the VIP Wembley Suite. It is understood they would watch Derby striker Patrick Bamford, a loan signing from Chelsea. But neither showed up and Bamford played only a minute of Derby’s defeat by QPR after coming on as a substitute in added time.

Januzaj said after the game : ‘It's my job to play one touch, to dribble, to entertain the crowd a bit.’ 'I wasn't under much pressure. I'm used to playing in front of 80,000 at Manchester United. I am happy with my debut.’ Belgium manager Marc Wilmots admitted, however, that a starting place in the side is not a guarantee for Januzaj. 'He . gives us an extra dimension,' said Wilmots, but warned Januzaj was . still far off getting his spot. 'He faces a lot of competition.'

"By . Alex Kay . Follow @@Alex_Kay_DM . Didier Deschamps is big on eye contact. As he answers each question he locks an intense gaze on you with the focus of a man who knows what it takes to win the World Cup. Deschamps did that, of course, as France captain in 1998 and now he is the man in charge of Les Bleus, looking to become only the third man after Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer and Brazil’s Mario Zagallo to win the tournament as a player and manager. Opponents: Deschamps' side face Ecuador, Switzerland and Honduras in Group E . Greatest achievement: Deschamps (right) lifts the World Cup in 1998 with France on home soil . Not that he thinks he has any chance of achieving that with a team who were dumped out in the group stage in 2010 and qualified for Brazil only by the skin of their teeth. ‘I’m going to Brazil with lots of ambition but I’m a realist, too,’ says the 45-year-old, whose side have been drawn with Switzerland,  Honduras and Ecuador in Group E. ‘There are countries that are much better than us on paper. We can’t hide from the truth. The only match that France won in the group stage of a World Cup in the last 12 years was against Togo in 2006. ‘I can’t talk about winning the World Cup, There are teams who are far ahead of us, including a team who won the last World Cup and the last two European Championships (Spain). There are six or seven. To win it for us would be viewed as a miracle.’ After a few minutes in his company it is clear why the former Marseille, Juventus and Chelsea midfielder is so keen on eye contact. Delighted: Patrice Evra looked in a good mood ahead of the training session . Rivals? Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris (right) arrives with Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud . Deschamps revels in human interaction, something he feels has become lost among current players and something he blames for their  reputation as spoilt, difficult and badly behaved. Samir Nasri, not selected for the World Cup because of his attitude, will surely take note. ‘Managing players is harder these days because of the arrival of new technology,’ says Deschamps. ‘They are all using it in their spare time so they become more isolated and selfish. They share less, they talk less. They have apps, their phones and the internet but they are less used to talking to people. ‘Nowadays you never see players playing cards. We used to sit around playing cards together all the time. But I can’t fight that, I have to adapt and change. ‘So I have to find new ways of getting people to interact because it is still healthy to know whether the guy sitting next to you at dinner has a wife or kids or whatever.’ Out of reach? Deschamps admits France need a miracle to win the World Cup . Focused: Sagna (right) with Rio Mavuba in training with the French squad on Sunday . What Deschamps feels all his players have in  common is vast amounts of money and meddling entourages. And it is the latter which concerns him most. ‘Yes, they have a lot of money but who gives it to them? It is not their fault. Where the problem comes is if a player is given lots of money before they have achieved anything in the game. Because money gives them power. ‘What has also changed is that there are so many people around players these days: the agent, the mother, the father, the brother, the sister, the uncle, an adviser. ‘You get 20 or so people who are living off the player, their lifestyle is supported by him. And they don’t always give him good advice. They need to keep him happy because they need money so they will tell him he is the best and the most beautiful even when he is not. ‘That makes a coach’s job hard. It makes the coach look like an idiot for saying the opposite. It makes relationships a lot harder.’ Idol: Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has a picture taken with a fan in Clairefontaine . France, of course, are no strangers to difficult relationships. Their last World Cup campaign was blighted by a players’ strike after coach Raymond Domenech sent home Nicolas Anelka. There was also talk of unrest throughout their recent qualifying campaign, which ended with a nail-biting 3-2  aggregate play-off win over Ukraine. The same accusations were not  levelled at the now immortalised class of ’98, though Deschamps thinks that winning is the only real difference between then and now. ‘We were seen as a really good team because we won,’ he adds. ‘We were a bunch of competitive guys all together going after the same prize. We were individuals with a common goal. ‘You have to find those kind of players because the danger is you end up with people who are going after individual goals rather than collective ones. ‘These guys are privileged to be playing for France at a World Cup.’ In search of that balance,  Deschamps has blooded plenty of young players over the past two years with mixed success. There have been defeats by Spain,  Germany, Uruguay and Brazil but there was also a recent victory over Holland and a return to form for Real Madrid striker Karim  Benzema, who had previously been dropped by the manager. However, the form and morale of some of his key Premier League players is not so good. Captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has endured a frustrating year at stuttering Tottenham, Bacary Sagna’s future is up in the air, Olivier Giroud’s form at Arsenal has disintegrated since he was caught with an underwear model in his hotel room ahead of a game, and Newcastle duo Loic Remy and Momo Sissoko are caught up in the increasingly bitter atmosphere at St James’ Park. It is a problem of which Deschamps is fully aware. Back then: Deschamps said in his day the players would constantly play cards, but now with new technologies they are isolated and selfish . ‘For the sake of their confidence, it would be a lot better if they didn’t have problems at their clubs but unfortunately that is what has  happened. And they might be pleased to get away from that in some ways. It is what happens. The only thing is that normally if the club have a good season, the player has a good season. I will have three weeks with them after the end of the season to make sure they are OK.’ Another hot topic of debate in France is the international form of Franck Ribery. While he has dazzled for Bayern Munich, he has not for his country. Lionel Messi would no doubt sympathise. ‘Franck is very experienced — he was there in 2006 and then in  the tougher times,’ says  Deschamps. ‘He is a leader for us. He is one of the best players in the world but he is a very nice guy, very smiley. And on the pitch he can make a big difference. Him playing as well for us as he does for Bayern is not just down to him, it is down to the rest of the team. ‘We have to help him, too — not just make him feel like he always has to be the one  to win the game  and make the difference. Aiming high: France are outside favourites for the World Cup . ‘You can’t just try to make him another Zidane. It is like looking for another Platini or another Fontaine. Following on from a great generation of players is hard. I had that after Platini retired. We missed the 1990 and 1994 World Cups.’ What about Deschamps making a difference, using his victory from 1998 to inspire his team to great things? ‘They are such good memories. Winning the World Cup is the most wonderful thing a footballer can ask for. That experience of course helps me but I never talk about it to my players now. ‘I have to adapt and deal with the players and the moment. It is part of my past, a wonderful thing but not something that has  anything to do with my players now. I can’t be the same as Aime  Jacquet (France’s World Cup- winning coach). He is different to me and my players are different to our team back then. ‘Every manager I’ve had is a reference point for me — good or bad. There are some that have had more influence than others but I have my personality, too. And you have to adapt. The same thing doesn’t work in two places. Italy had the biggest influence on me but I like my team to be more attacking. Better days: Deschamps (background) trains with Marcel Desailly at the 1998 World Cup . ‘I want us to have the ball. That won’t always be possible — if we are playing Spain for example — but that is what I am looking for.’ Deschamps has been busy watching endless videos of Switzerland, Ecuador and Honduras — he and Laurent Blanc are the only members of the 1998 squad who are in management — and he is in no doubt about who the favourites are. ‘The Swiss are the favourites for our group. They have been better than us in the past two years. That’s why my goal has to just be beating Honduras on June 15. Honduras might not seem scary to most people but we have to take them seriously. ‘I won’t pretend that we couldn’t  have had a harder draw but I remember that we had a very good draw, too, in 2010 — and that didn’t end well. We cannot underestimate these teams. They are not there by accident. Three Lions: Deschamps says England are more likely to win the World Cup than France . ‘The same teams are the favourites to win it: Spain, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Germany, Holland . . . ’ And what about England? ‘After that come England and Belgium! I’ve met Roy Hodgson plenty of times and they are a strong team still. But what is certainly a problem for the national team is the Premier League. The best players are foreign so there aren’t many English players. ‘But the top players are playing for top clubs so they are used to high demands, to the necessity of winning every match. It is the same for my team.’ That’s why you feel his eyes remain firmly on the prize.","Didier Deschamps leads France to the World Cup this summer as manager, and was a winner as captain in 1998 .

Andy Murray hardly needs any extra incentive when he steps out at the French Open, but he got it anyway on Monday night when Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka was humbled. The Swiss was Murray’s scheduled last-eight opponent until he fell to a dismal 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-0 defeat to Spain’s Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, opening up that whole quarter of the draw. Nobody has done more this season to puncture the aura of the ‘Big Four’ than Wawrinka, who followed up his  Melbourne triumph with victory at the Monte Carlo Open in April. In climbing to world No 3 he has amassed a 6-0 record against top-10 players in 2014, and that stands intact because Garcia-Lopez is ranked only 41st. Wawrinka’s error-strewn first-round performance as the light faded emphasised how consistent Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Murray have been in winning round after round in the Grand Slams over the last 10 years. Down and out: Stanislas Wawrinka never looked comfortable in heavy conditions in Paris . Over and out: Wawrinka's defeat by Guillermo Garcia-Lopez opened the draw up for Andy Murray . The pressure of turning up at a major . with the expectations  created by what he did in Australia appeared to . have withered Wawrinka, while the unseeded Spaniard showed how dangerous . the rank-and-file can be. For . Murray, Tuesday afternoon will be the first time since 2011 that he . goes into a Grand Slam  without Ivan Lendl in his corner. A good run at .

Argentinian qualifier Facundo Bagnis defeated Frenchman Julien Benneteau 6-1, 6-2, 1-6,  3-6, 18-16. The 144-minute deciding set took longer than the first four put together. Golubev . would like to inflict the latter on Murray, and the weapon he will . employ is his forehand which, when it runs hot, is potent enough to . cause anyone problems. ‘I . have to play my tennis,’ said Golubev, whose parents are both doctors. ‘Every match you can be different with the tactics, with the small . things, but basically I will attack. I’m not going to stay behind the . baseline five metres just waiting for his mistakes.’ The . glitz of the Grand Slams will have seemed remote to James Ward . yesterday, and the closest he came to any glamour was having the brother . of  Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna in his corner.

After . playing an excellent first set the British No 3 was slightly . unfortunate to be forced off for rain, which did not just stop his . momentum but made the clay slow and heavy, which better suited the . rock-solid Spaniard. ‘Look, . I’m 27; I’m not 32. People sometimes forget that,’ he said of his . top-100 prospects. ‘I’ve had injuries in the past when I’ve had chances, . but it’s not an excuse.

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . ARSENAL DON'T DESERVE RAMSEY... HE SHOULD PLAY ALONGSIDE BALE . BARKLEY, SHAW AND WICKHAM PROVE YOUNG TALENT CAN FLOURISH . Ryan Giggs has been a joy to watch and part of me was saddened when he announced his retirement – I was disappointed I wouldn’t be able to see him play again. But I bet deep down he wonders what might have happened had he moved away from Manchester United. By the turn of the century he had already won everything he could win at United. He was winning medals season after season, nobody questioned his greatness. Retirement: Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs announced his retirement after a 24-year playing career . Won it all: Giggs may wonder what would have happened had he moved away from Manchester United earlier - he had won everything there is to win with the club by the turn of the century . Only Giggs could change that but he chose not to. Was that loyalty? Maybe. But it’s not hard to be loyal to a club paying you handsomely and dominating trophies. David Beckham left the comfort zone of Old Trafford and won titles for Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Among the greats who were winning trophies but still chose the brave option and changed clubs and countries are Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo (both Brazilian and Portuguese versions), Ronaldinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Move: David Beckham left United and won League titles with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain . Winner: Giggs eventually won 34 major honours with United, including 13 league titles, the last in 2013 . So in his mid-20s, after creating history and winning the Treble with United, what was stopping Giggs leaving his legacy and legend status at United totally intact and moving to another European giant to do it all again at a different club? There would have been no shortage of takers. I guess the comfort zone is hard to leave. And in turn it makes me wonder how Giggs will be viewed by his new manager Louis van Gaal. Some have suggested the decision to make Giggs assistant manager was made for Van Gaal, rather than instigated by him. New boss: Louis van Gaal has made Giggs his new assistant manager at Old Trafford . Experience: Patrick Kluivert (right) can draw on more experience than Giggs having played in five countries . The new boss will appreciate the inside information on the club culture at Old Trafford I’m sure. But David Moyes had similar input at his disposal and look what happened to him. I don’t think getting the gossip on who Giggs likes and doesn’t like at United will be high on the new manager’s list of priorities. The real issue is this: can Giggs have the all-round knowledge and experience to bring much else to the job? Compare his experience with that of Van Gaal’s current assistant with the Dutch national team. Transition: Giggs has made the move to the coaching staff but deciding to stay rather than moving on when he was younger means the Welshman's place among the very best is in doubt . Patrick Kluivert played in five different countries, experiencing great success, as well as disappointment. I’m not saying Kluivert was a greater player than Giggs, but he can draw on a broader football experience in his coaching career. Giggs could have done all that, but he chose not to. He will be a Manchester United great, and a Premier League legend, but his place among the greats of Europe isn’t certain.","The Manchester United legend might wonder what would have happened had he moved away from Old Trafford .

"By . Mark Prigg . Ebay did not tell customers about the cyber attack that compromised the details of 145 million users immediately because it thought the customer data was safe, the site's boss has revealed. The auction site initially believed that customer data was safe as forensic investigators reviewed a network security breach discovered in early May, global marketplaces chief Devin Wenig has revealed. He declined to say when the company first realized customer data was involved or how many days it took them to prepare Wednesday's public announcement about the massive breach in which hackers accessed data belonging to all 145 million eBay users. Scroll down for video . Ebay initially believed that customer data was safe as forensic investigators reviewed a network security breach discovered in early May, its boss has revealed. The eBay database was hacked between late February and early March. It gave hackers access to encrypted passwords and other non-financial data. This included eBay customers' name, encrypted password, email address, home address, phone number and date of birth. However, the database did not contain financial information or other confidential personal data. Cyber attackers accessed the information after obtaining ‘a small number of employee login credentials’. The online market place added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members' accounts. But security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud. eBay became aware of the hack a fortnight ago but is still unsure exactly how it happened. It is unclear why it has taken eBay so long to make users aware of breach.'When we found out that there was, we moved swiftly to disclose,' he added. 'For a very long period of time we did not believe that there was any eBay customer data compromised,' Wenig tole Reuters in the first comments by senior executives since the company disclosed the breach this week. 'When we found out that there was, we moved swiftly to disclose,' he added. The auction site has been blasted for an 'inexcusable delay' in taking action after it was revealed that its servers were hacked three months ago - compromising the personal details of 15 million British users. The email, home . addresses, passwords, phone numbers and birth dates of every eBay . account holder - 145 million worldwide -  are now in the hands of the hackers. The company has told users to urgently change their passwords amid the biggest criminal raid ever carried out . online. It has been revealed that hackers accessed eBay databases by using the accounts of company employees as long ago as February. MPs have rounded on the American company for the 'inexcusable delay' in informing its customers. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, told the Telegraph: 'We . have urged companies to take much more seriously the threat of hacking. It is inexcusable that a company as important as eBay has failed to . inform its customers immediately that this has occurred. We need a full . explanation. 'We will be writing to them to ask how this happened and whether this problem has been resolved.' In a statement on their website, the . US auction site said it was asking all its users to reset their . passwords after an attack ‘compromised a database containing encrypted . passwords and other non-financial data’. Often consumers use their eBay . password for a host of other websites, including their banks, so they . may also need to make changes to these to protect their accounts from . being hijacked. Paul . Martini, the chief executive at iboss Network Security, said that the . online auction site was the 'golden goose of hacking targets'  due to . the sheer amount of information which is held. He . said that the damage could have already been done and warned that while . hackers may  not be taking money or goods out of eBay - they may be . using personal information to target other sites. An eBay spokesman said: . 'We discovered unauthorised access to our corporate network earlier in . May and immediately began a forensic investigation which discovered this . issue leading to yesterday’s announcement. The auction site added that it had no evidence of there being unauthorised activity on its members' accounts. But security experts are warning hackers could still use personal details to commit identity fraud . 'eBay is a global marketplace and this thorough investigation worked as quickly as possible.' The company . owns and runs the internet payment system PayPal, but claimed that this . was not involved in the raid, saying: ‘PayPal data is stored separately . on a secure network, and all PayPal financial information is . encrypted.’ The firm has . 145million active users and accounted for £126billion worth of commerce . in 2013. A spokesman added: . ‘Working with law enforcement and security experts, the company is . aggressively investigating the matter and applying the best forensics . tools and practices to protect customers. ‘Information . security and customer data protection are of paramount importance to . eBay Inc, and eBay regrets any inconvenience or concern that this . password reset may cause our customers.’ The cyber attack was made between late February and early March, giving hackers access to eBay customers' name, encrypted password, email address, physical address, phone number and date of birth. The firm said it will be emailing users later today to inform them of the breach . ‘Our customers are our highest priority; and to . ensure they continue to have a safe, secure and trusted experience on . eBay, we will be asking all users to change their passwords. ‘There is no evidence that any financial information was accessed or compromised; but we are taking every precaution.’ But . Graham Cluley, independent security expert, said: ‘Obviously they’ve got . hold of names, addresses and dates of birth. All of this can be used to . commit identity fraud. ‘If . they have your password, and you have the same password for other . websites, hackers could access your email, your Amazon account and who . knows what else.’ And . internet security expert Paul Martini said: ‘eBay users must act and . follow the advice to change their passwords. But the damage could have . already been done, as the time lag is months between the cyber breach . and the discovery of the breach. ‘It . could well have been viewed as the golden goose of hacking targets. Its . popularity means that it holds personal details, making its a potential . gold mine.’ He added: . ‘Cyberhackers may not hit the obvious target of siphoning money or goods . out of eBay; they may take the personal information gained from the . database and target other popular sites.’ The . internet is still recovering from the Heartbleed bug, a flaw in the . OpenSSL encryption on computers that protects user information when . someone is online. The flaw . had been present for two years undetected, and offered hackers a way . into personal accounts across the web. UK parenting website Mumsnet was . the first to admit they had been a victim of the bug. Fixes, or . ‘patches’, have since been applied across the web as sites recover from . the breach in security. What personal details were stolen? Hackers gained access to eBay customers' names, encrypted passwords, email addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers and dates of birth. It is unclear whether all, or any, of the details were taken but security experts are warning people to assume the worst. Are my credit cards details safe? The firm said that the infiltrated part of the network did not contain any financial details, so in theory, yes. Will changing my password solve the problem? Changing passwords will stop hackers from being able to use any login details that were stolen. However, they could still use names, addresses and birth dates to commit identity fraud. It’s a good idea to change passwords following any attack such as this. It’s also important to update login details on any sites that use the same password. If a hacker has your password and email address they could use it to attempt to access other sites that use the same combination. As a rule, the same password should never be used across different sites. Should I change my PayPal password as well? PayPal, which owns eBay, has confirmed its accounts and customers have not been affected by this cyber attack. However, as a matter of course, it’s good practice to change all related passwords across different sites, including PayPal. Which countries are affected? At the moment, we can assume that all eBay customers worldwide will be affected by this breach, until eBay says otherwise. Is this hack a result of the Heartbleed bug? When Heartbleed was exposed, eBay announced its customer’s account were secure and had not been affected. This suggests the latest hack is a separate attack. How did hackers steal the information? It is unclear how the hackers got hold of the information but eBay said it is working with forensic teams to get an answer to this question. Why did it take so long for eBay to inform customers of the breach? MailOnline has contacted eBay for an answer to this question. It is unclear what caused the delay. Typically, following cyber attacks, a firm will investigate the breach to try and determine how many people are affected, and the severity of the attack, before issuing advice.","Attack made between February and March and affects 145 million users .

"By . Mark Prigg . At first glance, it looks like something from a sci-fi films - an entire nebula trapped inside a stone. However, in fact the incredible object is an opal, found in Oregon. It was sold by auction house Bonhams for $20,000, described as 'suitable for mounting as a stunning and unique pendant.' The breathtaking Contra Luz Opal was found in Oregon, which appears to have a nebula inside it . The Eagle Nebula, one of the two largest and sharpest images Hubble Space Telescope has ever taken . 'The clear, transparent crystal body having a fine, firey play-of-color that is gem quality,' the auction house said. Contraluz is opal where you see the play of colors suspended inside by illuminating the back of the stone. In most opal the light has to fall on the front of the stone to see the play of fire. 'The piece has a botryoidal jasper formation which forms a unique inclusion,' Bonhams said. The 'nebula' inside is caused by Jasper, a microcrystalline variety of the mineral Quartz. It often contains an abundance of impurities, and therefore some regard it as a rock instead of a mineral. Weighing approximately 119.0 carats and measuring 46.0 x 44.0 x 10.1mm, the stone was auctioned last year for $20,000 . Weighing approximately 119.0 carats, it measures 46.0 x 44.0 x 10.1mm. The Opal was mined in Opal Butte, Oregon. The deposit at Opal Butte has been known since the late 1800's. Opal is a hydrated amorphous form of silica, and its water content may range from 3% to 21%. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most commonly found with limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl and basalt. The national gemstone of Australia, which produces 97% of the world's supply, the internal structure of precious opal makes it diffract light; depending on the conditions in which it formed, it can take on many colors. Precious opal ranges from clear through white, gray, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta, rose, pink, slate, olive, brown, and black. Of these hues, the reds against black are the most rare, whereas white and greens are the most common.","4.6cm wide Opal was found in Oregon, and sold by Bonhams for $20,000 .

"By . David Kent . Gareth Bale described lifting the Champions League trophy with Real Madrid as ""a dream come true"" after he scored the decisive goal in Lisbon. With a pulsating final between city rivals Real and Atletico Madrid finely poised at 1-1, Bale struck five minutes into the second period of extra time to break the hearts of the recently-crowned Primera Division champions. Having missed several chances throughout normal time, including a clear-cut opportunity when through on goal when the tie was still goalless, Bale held his nerve to steer a header into an empty net after Angel di Maria's shot was saved by Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Champion: Gareth Bale describes Real Madrid's 4-1 Champions League win vs Atletico as a dream come true . Rising high: Bale (right) put Real in front with a header in the second half of extra time at the Stadium of Light . Screaming from the rooftops: Bale's goal helped Madrid create history and win a tenth European crown . Marcelo's strike and Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty gave the scoreline a rather flattering look as Real claimed a 4-1 victory and finally sealed the dream of 'La Decima', their 10th European Cup triumph. When asked what it felt like to lift the trophy, Bale told UEFA.com: 'A dream come true, literally. When you're a little boy you dream of lifting the Champions League, and to lift the 10th one for Real Madrid is special. It's one that will go down in history. 'It's an amazing feeling to win the Champions League. And yes, it was a hard fought game, they made it very difficult for us, but yes, we showed our character that we've got in the team and eventually we were able to win. Europe's finest: Bale posted a serious of Tweets of Real's celebrations after the Champions League final . Boyhood dream: Bale's tweets included dressing celebrations (left) and Real's parade in Madrid (right) 'We always . were praying that we'd get a goal, and it was obviously great that we . did. We left it late, but it made it that extra bit more special. 'It . was a difficult extra time, everybody was tired, but we showed our . character again, and we were able to lift ourselves for the last 30 . minutes. We got the momentum and got a few goals to win the trophy.' Real boss Carlo Ancelotti commended the attitude of Bale. His persistence impressed Ancelotti, who said: 'It was very important because he had tried before, but he was unlucky in front of goal. 'But he turned up when he was needed.' It is the second time that Bale has scored the winner in a cup final in his first season with Real, with his solo goal against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey earning rave reviews. Bale's strikes in showpiece encounters will go a long way to silencing the critics that doubted his ability to live up to his world record £85.3million price tag, and Ancelotti is confident the former Southampton and Tottenham man is capable of improvement. 'All season Gareth has been good and he will be better next year,' Ancelotti added. 'We're very proud of having won this for all Madrid fans. Happiness is giving happiness to those who always follow us. The fans are very happy and that makes us happy. All smiles: Real boss Carlo Ancelotti praised Bale for his performance in the Champions League final in Lisbon . 'I have had a fantastic group of players who have always been professional and they showed that in this match too. Not only those who were delighted to be playing, but also those who were not playing. 'We've worked hard this season to achieve this.' Atletico had looked on course for a famous double as, having wrapped up the Primera Division title last week, they took a 36th-minute lead on Saturday night through Diego Godin's header. Yet their failure to extend the lead ensured they were on the back foot for much of the final half hour and their defence was finally breached in the third minute of stoppage time when Sergio Ramos headed home from a corner. Chin up: Atletico boss Diego Simeone said he was proud of his players despite their defeat . From then on, there was only going to be one winner, with several Atletico players showing visible signs of fatigue. Yet Atletico boss Diego Simeone, who was involved in an ugly on-field spat with Real defender Raphael Varane before the final whistle, was proud of his players. 'This fixture doesn't deserve one tear, when you give your life, there's nothing to say,' Simeone said. 'It's part of the game. You can win, you can lose. We lost but know that we gave everything. That exalts us and gives us the ability to continue growing.'","Gareth Bale says winning the Champions League is a 'dream come true'

"By . Mark Prigg . Climate change is threatening U.S. landmarks from the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour to the launchpads at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A new study has revealed the full extent of the crisis facing America's most cherised landmarks - and says almost two dozen are at risk. They include Boston's historic districts, the Harriet Tubman National Monument in Maryland and an array of Nasa sites including the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The new report says the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour (left) to the launchpads at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center (right) are at risk, also named were The Castillo de San Marcos (top middle), the oldest masonry fort in North America and parts of Boston . Landmarks at risk include the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York Harbor, which was the entry point for 14 million immigrants from 1886 to 1924. Sea level has risen 12 inches (30 centimeters) around New York City over the past century, the report said. Then came Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which flooded most of Liberty Island and all of Ellis Island, destroying most of their infrastructure and forcing their closure for months. New York is now rebuilding electrical systems on the islands 'as much as 20 feet above sea level and designing the heating and air conditioning systems to withstand flooding,' the report said. Other sites at risk include the first permanent British colony in North America at Jamestown Island in Virginia, and historic Charleston, South Carolina. Another is Fort Monroe, where the first African slaves arrived in 1619 and where 250 years later they were given refuge as 'contraband' of the American Civil War, a move that paved the way for the abolition of slavery. Also under threat are the César Chávez National Monument in Keene, California with floods, rising sea levels and fires, scientists said on Tuesday. National Landmarks at Risk, a report published by the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, highlighted more than two dozen sites that potentially face serious natural disasters. 'The imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation's heritage and history,' Adam Markham, director of climate impacts at the union, a non-profit organization for science advocacy in Washington D.C. and the study's co-author, said in a statement. The report is not slated for publication in a scientific journal, said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist who co-authored the report. It said that reducing carbon emissions could minimize the predicted risks posed by climate change. 'We must prepare our cherished landmarks for these worsening climate impacts and take steps to make climate resilience a national priority,' the scientists wrote. Where could be affected? 'At the same time, we must work to minimize these risks in the future by reducing the carbon emissions that are causing climate change and its accompanying impacts.' The report highlights 30 at-risk locations chosen because the science behind the risks they face is robust, and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts already affecting the United States' cultural heritage, the team said. At some sites -  such as Liberty and Ellis Islands and Cape Hatteras - steps have already been taken to prepare for these growing climate risks. At many other sites, such efforts have not yet begun. 'As these case studies illustrate, climate change is no longer a distant threat for others to worry about,' the team said. 'The consequences are already underway, with serious and growing risks to the places and communities we care about.' Alaska: Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Kivalina -- Bering Land Bridge National Monument and Shishmaref . California: Groveland -- César E. Chávez National Monument -- NASA Ames Research Center . Colorado: Mesa Verde National Park . Florida: Castillo de San Marcos, Fort Mose, St. Augustine's historic downtown, and the Lincolnville Historic District in St. Augustine -- Prehistoric shell structures at Ten Thousand Islands and Canaveral National Seashore -- NASA Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral . Hawaii: Kaloko-Honokōhau and Pu'uhonua o Hōnaunau National Historic Parks . Louisiana: NASA Michoud Assembly Facility . Maryland: Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument -- Historic Annapolis and U.S. Naval Academy . Massachusetts: Boston's Faneuil Hall and the Blackstone Block Historic District .

South Carolina: Charleston's Historic District . Texas: Johnson Space Center . Virginia: Historic Jamestown -- Fort Monroe National Monument -- NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Langley Research Center . The report concluded that action must be taken now. 'If future generations of Americans are to experience the joy and wonder that these extraordinary places engender, we must act now to protect them from the impacts of climate change today and prepare them for expected additional changes tomorrow. 'We must also take steps to minimize the risks of climate change in the future by taking immediate action to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving up the planet's temperature. 'The historic legacy of the United States is at stake.' Drastic change: The Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC one day may only be accessible by boat . Jamestown, Virginia - the first permanent English colony - could be completely inundated due to rising sea levels, and the nearby Fort Monroe, 'will become an island unto itself within 70 years,' Markham said. In the western United States, rising temperatures have led to an increase in wildfires by melting winter snowpacks earlier, leaving forests drier for longer, the report said. Among California's 20 largest fires since 1932, a dozen have happened since 2002, the report said. An unrelated report published on Monday showed that the California drought has cost thousands of jobs and $1.7 billion to farmers in the state's Central Valley. Governor Jerry Brown has partly blamed climate change for the drought. Earlier this months Scientists warned that vast glaciers in West Antarctica are locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming – and created incredible images show the effect the melt would have on some of the U.S’s classic coastal city areas. Experts say the melt could add 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 meters) to current sea levels in a few hundred years and the images illustrate the impact this increase would have on cities including Miami, Boston and San Francisco. The photographs were developed by Pittsburgh-based digital artist Nickolay Lamm, based on sea level-rise mapping data from Climate Central. Watery Boston: This image shows what the city's Back Bay would look like if sea levels rose by 12 feet, with roads leading to the bay completely submerged . Soggy playing conditions: AT&T Park in San Francisco would need to become a water polo venue, according to Nickolay Lamm's digital imaging . Flooded: The San Diego Convention Center would be completely unusable if sea levels rose by 12 feet, with water almost encroaching onto the road next to it . Venice Beach: Los Angeles' famous coastal hot-spot might only be navigable by canoe in the future, with the beach totally submerged by the waters of the Pacific . Road to nowhere: Miami's Ocean Drive is a popular spot for a stroll and a cruise, but in a few hundred years it might be better suited to fishing expeditions . In the shocking pictures the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C is surrounded by water, Ocean Drive in Miami looks like it would only be navigable by boat and Crissy Field in San Francisco is mostly under water. And you'd need waders to walk around The San Diego Convention Center, according to the predictions. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Some scientists believe that a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is affecting wind patterns around Antarctica, driving warmer waters towards the continent. Bob Ward, from the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Although such extreme sea level rise is only likely to occur after several centuries of global warming, these startling images should help U.S politicians and the public to understand the scale of the risks created by climate change.' Alarming: The Boston Harbor Hotel will need more than a few sandbags in the future to keep the water out, if Climate Central is correct .

Tara from Dallas, Texas, who declined to give her first name or age to CBS News, said the body trend - sparked by naturally-slender celebrities including Cara Delevingne and Alexa Chung - is what 'every girl' lusts after, despite it being physically impossible for most. Indeed, even after hitting the gym five days a week and eating healthy, the blonde found her legs still touched above the knees so she paid Thrive Institute $999 to 'magic her thin'. Scroll down for video . Body trend: Young women are turning to 'fat-zapping' laser treatment on their legs in a bid to achieve the impossibly thin 'thigh gap' look . The clinic recently invested in a Zerona Cold Laser device, more frequently used by women to tone the stomach and arm area. The slimming gadget - approved by the FDA for aesthetic treatment in 2010 - uses Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) that ‘pokes’ temporary holes in the walls of fat cells, causing them to collapse. The expelled liquid fat is then used as energy or processed via the liver. Zerona is about half the price of liposuction and manufacturers say it does not cause any pain or swelling. Make me thin! Tara (pictured) who declined to give her first name or age to CBS News, said the body trend is what 'every girl' lusts after despite it being unachievable for most . Nothing was working: Indeed, even after hitting the gym five days a week and eating healthy, the blonde found her legs still touched above the knees so she paid Thrive Institute $999 to 'magic her thin' Zapping the fat away: Thrive Institute in Dallas - the clinic Tara visited - recently invested in a Zerona Cold Laser device, traditionally used by women to tone the stomach and arm area . Now it appears young women are hoping it will help shave inches off their legs as they look to emulate their favorite super-skinny celebrities. Tara was told she would see the results in about two weeks after going in for six 40-minute sessions. As she was filmed having her thighs 'lasered' in a bikini, she exclaimed, ' I can't feel a single thing.' Clint Herzog, the owner of Thrive Institute appears optimistic that Zerona will be in high-demand over the coming months as beach season hits. 'Everybody . has one part of their body that it's really hard to get fat off right? And that's where Zerona comes in,' he said.

Manchester United will give supporters a glimpse of Louis van Gaal in action when they broadcast Holland's friendly against Ecuador live on their in-house channel this Saturday. The Dutch coach is expected to be unveiled as David Moyes' successor next week after the club revealed they would not announce anything immediately. MUTV are handing fans the opportunity to see exactly how Van Gaal is setting up his side ahead of the World Cup - even if they are billing the screening as Robin van Persie coming up against team-mate Antonio Valencia. Watching brief: Manchester United are screening Louis van Gaal's Holland against Ecuador on Saturday . The man to watch: Striker Robin van Persie will play for the Dutch as they prepare for this summer's World Cup . It will be shown at 7.30pm live from the Amsterdam ArenA. Van Persie is Holland's captain and talisman up front, while Valencia provides a potent threat down the right for the South Americans. There is some speculation as to how Van Gaal will operate in Brazil, which could have an impact on how United go about trying to regain their Champions League status next season. His default formation is the popular 4-3-3, but the former Barcelona boss admitted this week that he had spoken to van Persie about a potential switch to 3-5-2. 'I discussed changing the formation with Robin as I talk about these matters with my captain,' he said, while there is talk that the 30-year-old could be handed the armband at Old Trafford this summer as well.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . For Jordan Henderson, the road to Rio has been a road to redemption. From a disappointing England debut, a big-money move that threatened to go awry and an unflattering cameo in Sir Alex Ferguson’s autobiography, he has returned to Roy Hodgson’s plans with a timely late run. Henderson’s rapid progress and his midfield understanding with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard mean he is likely to play a vital role for Hodgson in Brazil. Heading to Brazil: Jordan Henderson hopes to complete his road to redemption at the World Cup . Midfield pair: Henderson and Jack Wilshere could like up for England together in Brazil . It would complete the circle neatly if he were to start the first group game against Italy in Manaus, a year after he captained the country in a disastrous European Under 21 Championship. ‘There was no dressing it up; we didn’t do as well as we should have done,’ said Henderson. ‘I looked at myself and what I could’ve done but quickly shifted focus on to helping Liverpool have a good season.’ He became a driving force in the team who pushed Manchester City closest for the title. Many believe Liverpool would not have thrown the title away had Henderson not missed three of the final four games after a red card against City. Going the distance: Henderson and Steven Gerrard helped Liverpool push for the title this season . It was one more setback, but he is strong on the rebound. Two years ago, as a late call-up for Euro 2012, he suffered a tweet from Joey Barton, who claimed: ‘If Henderson is in, any Englishman not currently in the squad can feel aggrieved.’ Then Fergie questioned his peculiar gait and running style. ‘It was a bit strange,’ said Henderson. ‘I didn’t buy the book but I read what it said and I took it as a bit of a compliment because he said he was watching me and thinking about buying me.’ United didn’t buy him but Liverpool paid £16million to Sunderland in 2011, although Brendan Rodgers was prepared to sell him to Fulham two years ago. If that move had gone through, Henderson would have been preparing for the road to Rotherham in the Championship. Middle man: Henderson could partner Gerrard in midfield for England . There was advice and support from Gerrard and sessions with Liverpool sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, who will be with the England squad in Brazil, to rebuild his confidence. ‘In football you are going to have times where you have got to be strong,’ said Henderson. ‘I always believed I was good enough to be playing for Liverpool and England. ‘Going to Liverpool, you expect to play well every week and that was new for me, the hardest thing to deal with. The big players at Liverpool help you a lot but you have to deal with stuff on your own.’ Over time he convinced Rodgers. ‘I was performing well; the gaffer just kept playing me,' he said. An England recall followed. Despite not playing in the qualifying campaign, Hodgson picked him to start a friendly against Denmark in March. It was his first full cap since his debut under Fabio Capello in 2010. ‘I was more mature,’ he said. ‘I felt as if I’d improved from then until Denmark. I was only 20 when I made my debut. It was a hard game. From then until Denmark I felt as if I’d improved. I was a different person really.’","Henderson looking for starting spot at World Cup to complete impressive season .

"By . Mark Prigg . Microsoft has unveiled a new 'megatablet' it hopes will take on the iPad. Costing from $799 to $1949, the Surface Pro 3, Microsoft's third attempt at a tablet, will have a screen measuring 12 inches diagonally, up from 10.6 inches in previous models. Microsoft says it is also thinner and faster than before - but did not, as expected, also launch a smaller tablet. Scroll down for video . That's a handful: The Surface Pro 3 has a screen measuring 12 inches diagonally, up from 10.6 inches in previous models. Microsoft says it's also thinner and faster than before. The tablet also has a newly redesigned keyboard case . The Surface Pro 3 has a 12-inch ClearType Full HD display . 5MP and 1080p HD front- and rear-facing cameras . 4th-generation Intel Core processor . Up to 8 GB of RAM . Up to nine hours of Web-browsing battery life . Optional surface pen . Redesigned keyboard case . Microsoft announced the device at an event in New York, and it will go on sale in June. The Surface is an important part to new CEO Satya Nadella's mobile-focused strategy. Microsoft is trying to boost sales of Windows tablets and phones to stay relevant with consumers as computing habits change. At a presentation in New York, Nadella made it clear that Microsoft, which recently acquired Nokia's handset business, is committed fully to making its own devices, despite a lack of success for its phones and tablets so far. 'We are not building hardware for hardware's sake,' said Nadella, at the event. 'We want to build experiences that bring together all the capabilities of our company.' 'Surface Pro 3 is a tablet and a laptop,' the firm said. 'Multiple processor, RAM and storage options intersect with a sleek design that, with a simple snap or click, transform the device from a perfectly balanced tablet to a full-functioning laptop and back again — all in a beautiful package that is 30 percent thinner than an 11-inch MacBook Air.' 'So many people carry both a laptop and a tablet but really want just one device that serves all purposes,' said Panos Panay, corporate vice president, Microsoft Surface. 'Surface Pro 3 is the tablet that can replace your laptop — packing all the performance of a fully powered laptop into a thin, light and beautifully designed device. 'You’ll love being able to carry a single device for your next class, workday or weekend getaway knowing you have all the power you need.' Satya Nadella, Microsoft Corp chief executive, unveils the latest models of the Surface tablet in New York - and says the firm will keep making hardware . However, Microsoft, which is recasting itself as a 'devices and services' company, has not made much headway on the devices side, except for its Xbox game console. The Surface, launched in October 2012 and refreshed last year, has about 2 percent of the tablet market, failing to make a dent on Apple's iPad. Microsoft has only 3 percent global share in smartphones, chiefly through Nokia. The first Surface came out in late 2012 to lackluster sales. The Surface 2's debut last October came with a greater marketing emphasis on tasks people normally tackle on laptops, such as creating documents and editing movies. The Surface Pro 3 is 9.1mm thick . The Surface Pro 3 has a 12-inch screen, and also an optional pen. It is Microsoft's third attempt at a tablet. One of Microsoft boss Satya Nadella's first jobs was to revealed the firm had brought its Office software to the iPad for the first time. Office for the iPad, a software suite that includes programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and works on rival Apple Inc.'s hugely popular tablet computer. The app allows reading and presenting of documents for free, but will require a subscription to Office365 to enable writing and editing. Investors have so far reacted well to Nadella's 'mobile first, cloud first' strategy to recast the software maker as a 'devices and services' company, sending its shares up 9 percent since he took the helm. So far he has stressed the services side of the business, making the momentous move to put Microsoft's Office suite on Apple Inc's iPad. This was popular with Wall Street and more importantly with consumers, who performed 27 million downloads in a matter of weeks.However, the firm is struggling with hardware, and has just 3 percent of the global market share in smartphones. Given that tiny market, some investors believe Microsoft should not waste time and money on the low-margin hardware business. ValueAct Capital, which led the shareholder revolt last year which culminated in previous CEO Steve Ballmer's retirement, has lobbied against Microsoft's hardware effort, including its costly acquisition of Nokia's handset business. The 'megatablet' also works with a special pen . 'Nadella is off to a golden start as CEO, although turning around the tablet and mobile business over the next 12 to 18 months remain his two key Herculean tasks,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. 'If the turbulence gets too rough on the tablet and/or mobile segment, we can potentially see some strategic changes on the horizon around the hardware business.' Despite unspectacular sales, there are signs that Microsoft's Surface Pro 2, which runs the full Windows operating system, is starting to attract Microsoft's core business customers. 'There's certainly tons of interest in the Surface Pro as an Ultrabook (lightweight laptop) replacement that has tablet capabilities,' said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at a Microsoft event in San Francisco, to launch Office for the iPad . 'It is the No. 1 model I get asked about, it's going to have a lot of eyes on it.'Even if the Surface never dominates the market, Gownder thinks Nadella and Microsoft are right to persevere with hardware, if only as a way of showing other device makers how best to make use of Windows. 'Microsoft would be nuts not to have devices in the mix. 'The danger is in not exploring,' said Gownder. The Surface 'is an important product to basically show what their overall vision is for Windows, and also to offer businesses and consumers another choice.'","First two versions of tablet have seen disappointing sales .

"By . Damien Gayle . As chief political correspondent for Sky News, Jon Craig is surely aware of the hazards posed by recording his reports within earshot of Big Ben. The clocktower rings in every quarter hour and, on each and every hour of the day, the sound of its great bell resonates across Westminster and beyond as it enumerates the time. But it seems to have nonetheless come as a surprise to the Mr Craig when Big Ben's chimes came as he was in full flow of delineating the day's events in politics. Ever the professional: John Craig delivers his report on David Cameron's trip to Brussels . But what's this? Something dismays the veteran reporter who shuts his eyes in rage . Why you! Craig turns his head to Big Ben, whose chimes have ruined his recorded segment . 'Oh, f***ing hell,' he blurted, angrily turning his head to Big Ben in footage that was broadcast to the nation on Sky News last night. Mr Craig's obscene outburst prefaced a brief awkward silence followed by a quick cut back to the studio, where newsreader Lukwesa Burak was staring down the camera witheringly. 'We do apologise for that,' she said. 'That was a much earlier recording and our apologies here from Sky News. Moving on...' Mr Craig had been trying to report on Prime Minister David Cameron's trip to Brussels, Belgium, to meet European Union leaders and discuss the rise of eurosceptic parties in last week's elections to the European Parliament.

Oh dear: The viewers are treated to Mr Craig's naughty boy face as he realises the obscenities he has uttered . Producers, it later emerged, had mistakenly aired an out-take. A full report, with no obscenities, was broadcast later. Ms Burak later admitted on Twitter to being 'slightly thrown' by the unexpected expletive. She tweeted: 'We do apologise for that. The perils of distracting individuals being a nuisance whilst recording outdoors. We're all human!' But it is in fact not the first time that Mr Craig inadvertently turned the airwaves blue when discussing Tory politicians. In 2011 he accidentally called Jeremy Hunt a very disparaging name after getting his C's mixed up with his H's. Not impressed: Mr Craig's obscene outburst prefaced a brief awkward silence followed by a quick cut back to the studio, where newsreader Lukwesa Burak was staring down the camera witheringly . Having reminded Londoners of the passing of time for the past more than 150 years, the resounding peals of Big Ben are a feature of the UK capital's soundscape that few could fail to anticipate. Since 2012 the 315ft tower itself has officially been known as the Elizabeth Tower, in honour of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. It was raised as a part of Charles Barry's design for a new Palace of Westminster, after the old one was destroyed by fire on the night of October 16, 1834. It takes its nickname, Big Ben, from the colloquial name for its 13½-ton Great Bell, which hangs at its pinnacle and whose toll is one of the quintessential sounds of London.","Newsreader forced to apologise after footage was broadcast on Sky News .

Above, a grab from a video a Tim Hortons customer took of the calf . Fast friends: The little moose cozies up to Tim Hortons customer Shirley Erkila . He says he and his friends attempted to release the baby moose back into the wild several times, but the newborn just kept reappearing and getting dangerously close to the road. Rescuer: Mr Desgroseillers says he tried to release the moose back into the wild several times but it kept following him . Mr Desgroseillers then tried to contact an animal shelter, but it seemed the place was closed. He later learned that he accidentally called the animal hospital next door instead. Not knowing what to do, Mr Desgroseillers decided to take home the moose until the shelter opened the next day. That night the moose slept in Mr Desgroseillers bed and would get up often to cry. 'She slept about half an hour at a time and then she was up for two hours whining so I had a really rough, rough night,' Mr Desgroseillers told CTV News. The next morning, Mr Desgroseillers loaded the little moose into his truck and headed for the shelter - but decided to stop at a Tim Hortons doughnut shop first for some breakfast. The moose caused quite a stir with the early-morning coffee crowd, who came out to gawk and pet the little calf. One woman, Shirley Erkila, took video of her petting the moose outside the coffee shop and called it a once-in-a- lifetime experience. 'I basically felt blessed to be in a position to have crossed a path with that little animal. I felt I need to share that with other people,' Mr Desgroseillers said.

He weighs 25 pounds and is being cared for round-the-clock by a team of three nurses. They have named him Oliver. 'Only three people can be with him right now because he needs to bond,' said Adeline Charpin, an intern at the wildlife rehabilitation facility in Lively. 'We're doing all we can.'

Bella Amato and Chiara Tisamo were right behind Mathilda when she was crossing Warringah Rd, Narraweena in Sydney just after 7pm on Saturday. 'She kind of went about like three or four metres up in the air and flipped and she went head first and hit a brick fence,' Bella said. 'I thought I was imagining everything and I looked at Chiara and just went like – ""did this happen?""'. The girls explained how they were crossing the road when the pedestrian lights turned from a clear green to a flashing red, but Mathilda carried on crossing. 'You just have that instinct to just keep running because she was so close to the path,' Chiara explained. But before she could reach the other side, a car pulled out from behind the waiting traffic, hitting the young girl who was rushed to hospital with severe head injuries shortly afterwards. 'All of a sudden just this car came out of nowhere just speeding past and it just hit her,' Bella said. Bella's mother, Sogna Amato, also told Channel Nine about the terrifying phone call she received form her daughter at the scene. 'All I heard was screaming and crying, she was just screaming 'Matilda, the car, the car!""', Ms Amato said.

At a dizzying height of 2000ft the bridge . on Fleetwith Pike is among the most elevated in the world, and at 350ft . is the longest in Europe. The bridge, dubbed the the Lake District Skywalking Burma Bridge, links two peaks of the mountain together and forms part of Honister Slate Mine's Via Ferrata Xtreme experience.

Via Ferrata is Latin for Iron Way and the original routes consisted of a series of metal cables, rungs, ladders and bridges across the Italian Alps which soldiers used to carry munitions and supplies to their allies during both World Wars. The route on Fleetwith Pike is the first in the UK. Sky high: Thrill seekers have been lining up to traverse this rope bridge on Fleetwith Pike in the Lake District, which, at 2,000ft is twice as high as the Shard . Head for heights: Mountaineer Alan Hinkes traverses the bridge, which stretches 350ft between two mountain peaks, making it the longest in Europe . Dizzy: The tip of Fleetwith Pike, home of the via ferrata route is 2,126ft high, compared with the Shard in London which measures 1,016ft . Scale: The bridge, dubbed the the Lake District Skywalking Burma Bridge, links two peaks of the mountain together and forms part of Honister Slate Mine's Via Ferrata Xtreme experience . The Via Ferrata at Honister Slate Mine was first opened in 2007, when a cable was positioned along the mountain face, using tracks originally used by miners to traverse the peak. Its name meaning 'Iron Way' in Latin, via ferrata routes consist of rungs, cables, ladders and bridges positioned into mountain ranges and were originally used by soldiers during both World Wars as a means of getting across the Italian Alps and the Dolomites. At the outbreak of the First World War the Dolomites were part of Austria Hungary, and fierce battles were fought between Italy, part of the alliance, and Austria in the mountain range, with both sides trying to gain control of the peaks where observation stations and guns could be positioned. Trenches, dugouts and other relics of the First World War can still be found alongside many via ferratas in the Dolomite region. Today via ferrata routes remain popular with climbers, particularly in Italy, Germany, France and Spain, as they enable thrill seekers to climb technical rock faces without the need for a large amount of training and with only minimal amounts of equipment - such as helmets and harnesses. The Lake District route was the UK's first, but has not been without controversy. Plans to make the route larger by including a 1.2km zip wire were blocked by Lake District National Park planners in 2011, and a revised plan rejected in January 2013. Opponents argued against it on environmental grounds and said the proposed zip wire was too close to a walking route from the Honister pass to Haystacks, Alfred Wainwright's favourite fell. Lake District mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, who supported the expansion scheme, quit his role as Vice-president of the Friends of the Lake District after the group opposed the extension, which was originally proposed by the late mine owner, Mark Weir, who was killed in a helicopter crash in March 2011. Iron way: Via Ferrata is Latin for Iron Way and the original routes consisted of a series of metal cables, rungs, ladders and bridges across the Alps . Purpose: On the original via ferrata routes a series of metal cables, rungs, ladders and bridges were installed on the mountains to help soldiers ascend and descend treacherous climbing routes across the Alps . Area: The bridge cuts through the picturesque surroundings of the Honister pass, home to the Honister slate mine and often dubbed the wettest place in England . History: The bridge links two peaks of Fleetwith Crag, the side of which has been commercially quarried for its high-quality green slate since the 1750s. Slate mining and quarrying at Honister did stop in 1986, but restarted in February 1997 . Safety first: All visitors to the via ferrata are given safety equipment including a helmet and harness and are accompanied on their journey by a guide . Popular: Via ferrata is popular among many thrill seekers because it does not require a huge amount of training, and enables climbers to reach elevated peaks they might otherwise not be able to . Controversy: Plans to make the via ferrata route larger by including a 1.2km zip wire were blocked by Lake District National Park planners in 2011, and a revised plan rejected in January 2013 .","Bridge linking two peaks of Fleetwith Pike in Cumbria is among the highest in the world and the longest in Europe .

"By . Mark Prigg . A badly injured sea turtle's prospects are looking up - thanks to a new prosthetic fin designed by an Israeli team and modeled after the tail of a U.S. fighter jet. The green sea turtle, named 'Hofesh,' the Hebrew word for 'freedom,' was caught in a fishing net off Israel's Mediterranean coast in early 2009. With his two left flippers badly wounded, rescuers had to amputate, leaving him with a pair of stumps that made it difficult to swim. Scroll down for video . Hofesh, the Hebrew word for 'freedom,' swims with a prosthetic fin at the Sea Turtle Rescue Center in Michmoret, Israel. The prosthetic is modeled after the wings of a U.S. fighter jet. Inspired by the design of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-22 Raptor warplane, researchers designed the new prosthetic with two fins. Researchers originally designed a prosthetic based on a fish's dorsal fin. The contraption provided some improvement, but Hofesh still had trouble breathing and rising to the surface. Then, inspired by the design of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-22 Raptor warplane, they designed a new prosthetic with two fins. The device, somewhat resembling the aircraft's wings, was strapped onto Hofesh's back, allowing him to move easily around his tank. Yaniv Levy, director of Israel's Sea Turtle Rescue Center, said Hofesh was initially fitted with a diver's fin, but it provided little relief and he bumped into things as he tried to swim. Shlomi Gez, an industrial design student at Jerusalem's Hadassah College, read about the animal on the Internet and wanted to help. He designed a prosthetic based on a fish's dorsal fin. The contraption provided some improvement, but Hofesh still had trouble breathing and rising to the surface. Then, inspired by the design of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-22 Raptor warplane, Gez designed a new prosthetic with two fins. The device, somewhat resembling the aircraft's tail, was strapped onto Hofesh's back on Thursday, allowing him to move easily around his tank. The 'stealth' addon being put on Hofesh's back . 'I discovered it worked better than one fin on the back,' Gez explained. 'With two fins, he keeps relatively balanced, even above the water.' Levy said that Hofesh will never be able to return to the wild. However, he shares a tank with a blind female turtle named Tsurit, and researchers are optimistic the pair will mate, potentially adding to the local population of the endangered green sea turtles. The green sea turtle, named 'Hofesh,' the Hebrew word for 'freedom,' was caught in a fishing net off Israel's Mediterranean coast in early 2009. With his two left flippers badly wounded, rescuers had to amputate, leaving him with a pair of stumps that made it difficult to swim. He said it is difficult to say exactly how old the two turtles are, but they are estimated to be between the ages of 20 and 25, and approaching the age of sexual maturity. 'We have great plans for this guy,' Levy said. 'They will never go back to the wild, but their offspring will be released the minute they hatch and go immediately into the sea and live normally in the wild,' he added.","Green sea turtle named Hofesh had both his left fins amputated .

"By . Kate Lyons . and Freya Noble . The Gold Coast's 'Bum Crack Bandit', who made headlines when she flashed her backside during a robbery, has been sentenced to six years jail for shooting a man in a drug deal gone wrong. Eboni Pydde, 21, made headlines in 2011 when CCTV footage captured a distinctive tattoo on her buttocks as she robbed the Coomera Lodge Hotel late on the night of 27 December 2011. Pydde and several associates smashed one of the pub's windows with a crowbar to gain entry, before stealing alcohol, cans of Red Bull and a cash pool from the gaming area. Scroll down for video . Eboni Pydde was today sentenced to six years in jail for an armed robbery that took place in 2011 . Dubbed the 'bum crack bandit', Pydde is serving time for shooting a motorcyclist after she robbed a pub on the Gold Coast . The 21-year-old, pictured in green, covered up for court on Tuesday . CCTV footage showed Pydde, dressed in a hoodie, thongs, and low-slung jeans vault the bar to retrieve the alcohol, revealing her bum crack and a tattoo in the process. Crown Prosecutor Brendan Campbell told the Brisbane Supreme Court that while the robbery was taking place a motorcyclist, Luke Norris, arrived at the hotel to take part in a pre-arranged drug deal with one of the other burglars.

Mr Campbell said that Mr Norris bought half a gram of speed for $200 before preparing to leave on his bike, when he was shot at, reported The Australian. Mr Norris told the court that he saw Pydde hanging out the rear window of the car holding a small silver gun. Pydde was seen vaulting the bar before stealing alcohol and cans of Red Bull . Pydde (left) shot Mr Norris from the rear window of her car as he was preparing to ride off on his motorbike. She has been sentenced to six years in jail for the shooting . She wore a hoodie and low-slung jeans during the robbery. The jeans revealed her bum crack and a distinctive tattoo, which police used to help identify her . He was shot three times, hit in the hand and upper arm and sustained fractures to his bones as well as nerve damage, requiring several surgeries. Pydde was arrested on April 15, 2012. Her barrister, Damian Walsh, said Pydde was a 'psychologically damaged' young woman who had depression and indicators for PTSD as a result of the sudden death of a family member and a traumatic assault she endured at the age of 16. Justice David Boddice said Pydde's actions were 'highly dangerous' and malicious and of particular concern because there seemed to be no motive behind the shooting. Pydde has already served more than a year in jail and Justice Boddice took that into account during sentencing, saying she might be eligible for parole on December 1, after she had served 20 months behind bars. The woman's brother, Dion, is facing an unrelated murder charge.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Sea levels could rise far more rapidly than expected because canyons under Greenland's ocean-feeding glaciers are deeper and longer than previously thought. This was the warning issued by Nasa after researchers in California created the most detailed map to date of Greenland's vast canyon network hiding beneath its ice sheets. Their map revealed new valleys that sink below sea level, which can make glaciers more susceptible to melting, according to the study. Scroll down for video . The topography of West Greenland is shown in this graphic with hidden valleys in blue. On the right is the bed topography beneath the ice sheet. On the left is the urface topography and ice velocities . After Antarctica, Greenland's ice cap contains the second largest mass . of frozen freshwater in the world. The ice sheet ice sheet covers 660,000 sq miles (1,710,000 square km), or roughly 80 per cent of the surface of Greenland. Currently, melting from Greenland accounts . is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise. Researchers estimate half of Greenland's outlet glaciers could undergo . significant melting. UCI and Nasa’s latest study shows southern . Greenland's ragged, crumbling coastline is scored by more than 100 . canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean . A number of other glacial valleys found in the study are deeper and wider than those shown in earlier maps, and are located farther inland at an average distance of 41 miles (67 km). The findings mean some of Greenland's scenarios for melting ice need to be revised, the researchers said. Currently, melting from Greenland accounts is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise. Researchers estimate half of Greenland's outlet glaciers could undergo significant melting. The IPCC said last year that sea levels are likely to rise by between 10 and 32 inches (26 and 82 centimetres) by the late 21st century, after a rise of just seven inches (19 centimetres) since 1900 . However, older ice sheet models predicted the speedup would be temporary because the glaciers would soon melt back onto higher ground and stabilise. On the left is a first attempt at mapping topography buried beneath a glacier of South Greenland in 2001. The centre image is second attempt with data from Nasa Operation IceBridge flights. The right image shows the latest mapping technique revealing the presence of a deep canyon that connects the ice to the ocean . Map of Greenland is shown here. The ice is in white, ice-free land is in brown, and floating ice in blue . ‘The glaciers of Greenland are likely to retreat faster and farther inland than anticipated, and for much longer, according to this very different topography we have discovered,’ said Mathieu Morlighem, a scientists at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), . UCI and Nasa’s latest study shows southern Greenland's ragged, crumbling coastline is scored by more than 100 canyons beneath glaciers that empty into the ocean. Many canyons are well below sea level as far as 60 miles (100km) inland. Higher ground, where glaciers could stabilise, is much farther from the coastline than previously thought. Buried under the Greenland Ice Sheet, the subcontinent's bedrock topography has been estimated using soundings from ice-penetrating radar. However, the wet and fractured ice along the southern coastline cluttered the radar soundings so that large swaths of the bed remained invisible. To overcome that problem, Professor Morlighem and his colleagues devised an advanced technique to create a more accurate map. The technique makes the best use of several kinds of data: ice thickness measurements derived from airborne radar; satellite radar interferometry data on the speed and direction of ice movement: and estimates of snowfall and surface melt to the sea. By combining the different types of data, they were able to map the bed topography along Greenland's margins with unprecedented precision and detail. Currently, melting from Greenland accounts is thought to account for around 10 per cent of sea level rise. Researchers estimate half of Greenland's outlet glaciers could undergo significant melting . ‘The ice will stay in contact with the ocean for longer than we thought’, Professor Morlighem told Live Science. ‘Greenland is more vulnerable than we thought, but we can't say by how much.’ In August, a 466 mile-long (750 km) chasm on the same scale as parts of the Grand Canyon was discovered beneath the Greenland ice sheet. The canyon, which is as deep as 2,620ft (800m) in places, is thought to predate the ice sheet, which has itself been around for millions of years. In another study offering another sea-level rise warning, vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries, according to scientists. In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data of what researchers call 'the weak underbelly of West Antarctica' shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. The coastal ends of the glaciers rest on bedrock below sea level, holding back a vast weight of ice and making them vulnerable to melt, he said. 'It does seem to be happening quickly,' says University of Washington glaciologist Ian Joughin, lead author of a separate study into the same phenomenon. 'We really are witnessing the beginning stages.' It has the characteristics of a meandering river channel, although it dwarfs the UK’s largest river, the Severn, which is less than half the length and far more shallow. The canyon was found after scientists analysed radar signals collected by Nasa and researchers from the UK and Germany over several decades. Professor Jonathan Bamber, of Bristol University’s School of Geographical Sciences, said: 'With Google Streetview available for many cities around the world and digital maps for everything from population density to happiness one might assume that the landscape of the Earth has been fully explored and mapped. 'Our research shows there’s still a lot left to discover.'

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It may look like an modern art installation in a gallery, but this shell-shaped clock is designed to make telling the time easier. According to two designers, Westerners read in a straight line and often calculate mathematical equations in a long string too, so can find it unnatural to navigate a circular clock face. To solve the problem, the Amsterdam-based artists created the Linear Cycle Clock, which features a revolving ‘shell’ indicating the passing hours. Time for a change? Two designers in Amsterdam, the . Netherlands, have created the Linear Cycle Clock, which features a . revolving ‘shell’ that indicates the passing hours . While the shell slowly rotates around a central point like the hands of a clock, it points out the hours on a linear plate, so people only have to glance at the arty timepiece to tell the time. Of course digital displays already offer people a quick way to tell the time, but most are not so aesthetically pleasing. Sadly there is no way to mark the passing of seconds on the shell clock but the object is a thought-provoking art project, rather than a commercial offering, Gizmodo reported. Designers Boaz Cohen and Sayaka Yamamoto, of studio BCXSY . said: ‘This unique time display offers a playful alternative to one of . the most known objects to men and may draw some more attention and . increase awareness to our advance through time.’ Playing it straight: While the shell  (pictured left and right) slowly rotates around a . central point like the hands of a clock, it points out the hours on a . linear plate, so people only have to glance at the arty timepiece . Many designers have put their own spin on the clock – from a menagerie of smartwatches offering functions as well as telling the time, to giant installations that track the lunar cycle. The world's first moon clock is being planned, that will use tidal power to display the moon's phase on its 'face'. It is intended to sit at the historic . centre of time at Greenwich, London and would be made of three . concentric glass rings with LEDs beneath the surface, producing light . powered by tidal turbines if it is built.

Its mechanical arms then erase the time from this board, before starting again - and each time the robot writes, the numbers correspond to the real-world time as its being written. Designers in Washington DC have recently launched a watch that replaces hands with ball bearings so that it can be used by visually impaired people – as well as those who want to tell the time subtly.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Practically anything - from gadgets to shoes - can be made waterproof using a special coating, but this coating eventually wears off leaving items at risk from water damage. Now engineers have created a way to not only make such objects permanently waterproof, but make the material so resistant to liquid it causes water to physically bounce off. By adding tiny structures to the surfaces of everyday items, the researchers claim they have created the 'most extreme form of waterproof' - and it could one day be used to protect boats and planes. Scroll down for video . Researchers in Utah have created a technique to make any surface super waterproof. Existing waterproofing involves spraying surfaces with a coating, but by adding tiny structures to the surface instead, droplets bounce, pictured, rather than roll off . The super-hydrophobic surfaces the researchers are testing in the lab fall into one of two categories: surfaces with micro posts, or surfaces with ribs and cavities one tenth the size of a human hair. To create these micro-structured surfaces, the professors use a process similar to photo film development that etches patterns onto CD-sized wafers. The researchers then add a thin water-resistant film to the surfaces, such as Teflon, and use ultra-high-speed cameras to document the way water interacts when dropped, jetted or boiled on them. The researchers said that slight alterations in the width of the ribs and cavities, or the angles of the rib walls can significantly change the water responses. 'People know about these surfaces, but why they cause droplets or jets . to behave the way they do is not particularly well known,’ Professor Crockett . said. ‘If you don’t know why the phenomena are occurring, it may or may . not actually be beneficial to you.’ The technique was devised by Brigham Young University's mechanical engineering Professor Julie Crockett along with colleague Professor Dan Maynes based in Utah. ‘To create a superhydrophobic surface, you can’t just do that with a coating like Teflon or wax, you have to actually put a structure on it,’ explained Professor Crockett. ‘In nature, lotus leaves do this really well, so what we do in the lab is similar to what we observe on the lotus leaf – we have these structures, and we have water sitting on top of them.' Professor Crocket continued that superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a multitude of different ways. In her lab, the team used rib and cavity structures, as well as posts that the water sits on top of, like a ball. As the water droplet falls on to Professor Crocket’s superhydrophobic surface, it spreads out like a traditional drop on a surface. But, unlike typical droplets, the structure causes it to come back together again until it lifts off the surface completely. Professor Crockett explained that water molecules are more attracted to themselves than the surface she has created, meaning they pull together before rolling straight off the surface. Brigham Young University . Superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a multitude of different ways.  In the Brigham Young University lab, the team used rib and cavity structures, pictured left, or ones made of tiny posts, pictured right, that the water sits on top of like a ball . As water droplets fall on to superhydrophobic surfaces, pictured, they spread out like a traditional drop would. But, unlike typical droplets, the structures built into the surface causes the water to come back together again until it forms a ball and lifts off the surface completely . ‘Traditional waterproof products use a spray coating to protect the surface, at BYU we have developed a way of creating superhydrophobic surfaces so we aren’t just looking at droplets on surfaces, we’re looking at flow through surfaces,’ she continued. The surfaces could be applied to solar panels that don’t get dirty or can self-clean when water rolls off of them, or showers, tubs or toilets that prevent water spots forming. Crocket also said it could be used on bio-medical devices, such as the interior of tubes or syringes that deliver fluids to patients, hulls of ships, exterior of torpedoes or submarines and airplane wings that will resist wingtip icing in cold or humid conditions. The researchers' process was inspired by the way lotus leaves, pictured, repel rain drops. The surfaces could be applied to solar panels that don't get dirty or can self-clean when water rolls off of them, or showers, tubs or toilets that prevent water spots forming . Many existing treatments used to make objects waterproof involve spraying them with a hydrophobic coating such as Teflon, or a wax. This image shows how a droplet sits on top of a hydrophobic, rather than a superhydrophobic surface . Looking further ahead, Professor Crockett and Maynes’ research could be used to create cleaner and more efficient energy. ‘Nearly every power plant across the country creates energy by burning coal or natural gas to create steam that expands and rotates a turbine. 'Once that has happened, the steam needs to be condensed back into a liquid state to be cycled back through,’ explained the researchers. ‘If power plant condensers can be built with optimal super-hydrophobic surfaces, that process can be sped up in significant ways, saving time and lowering costs to generate power. ‘If you have these surfaces, the fluid isn’t attracted to the condenser wall, and as soon as the steam starts condensing to a liquid, it just rolls right off. And so you can very, very quickly and efficiently condense a lot of gas.’ The findings are published in journal Physics of Fluids.","Researchers have created a technique to make surfaces super waterproof .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A 41-storey-drop ride featuring a tower twice the height of the Statue of Liberty has been named the world's highest roller coaster - a month before it's set to open to the public. As construction work finally finished on the long-awaited Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom, it was announced the tower atop the 456-foot Kingda Ka ride in Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in New Jersey had broken the record. Hype around Zumanjaro has been building since rumours about a record-breaking tower ride began circulating in February 2012, with Six Flags bosses announcing their plans last year. Demo of ride below... Sinking feeling: Promotional artwork shows what the world's tallest drop ride, dubbed Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom, will look like when completed at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2014 . Breathtaking: Zumanjaro will drop brave riders 41 stories at 90mph. At the top, they'll be able to see the skyline of Philadelphia 52 miles away . As the name suggests, the roller coaster is not for the faint-hearted. The 'drop' is higher than Big Ben and travels . at speeds of 90mph. Forty-one riders are hoisted into the sky and then . rocketed back to earth while Kingda Ka trains launch toward them at . speeds of up to . 128mph. Riders will pause for a few terrifying moments at a point twice as tall . as the Statue of Liberty, allowing them to catch a glimpse of the . skyscrapers in Philadelphia 52 miles away before gravity plunges . them back to ground level in less than 10 seconds. Following the recent topping off of the track, the . construction, maintenance and engineering teams will now focus on installing . the lift mechanism, adding the three . gondolas that will whisk riders to the top of the tower. Then, after extensive ride testing, inspections and . certification, the first passengers will be able to board the ride later in May. The record for tallest tower ride was previously held by the . 400ft Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain near Los . Angeles. Talking about ride park president John Fitzgerald said: ‘Zumanjaro solidifies Six Flags Great Adventure’s dominance as the Northeast’s thrill capital. 'You’re going to have folks dropping 90mph. 'You’re . going to have the Kingda Ka cars racing around them at the same time. It’s really going to be fantastic. Fantastic views, but also terribly . exciting.' Park spokesperson Kristin Siebeneicher said: ‘It's definitely exciting that we are breaking a world record.' Mammoth: Each tower will feature a gondola for eight riders, which will help keep queues as short as possible . Zumanjaro will be attached to Kingda Ka, the . world's tallest roller coaster. At right is an actual photo of Kingda . Ka. At left is a rendering of how the coaster will look with Zumanjaro . attached . Meanwhile, the park says this is the last season for its wooden Rolling Thunder roller coaster after more than three decades. ‘There are definitely guests, especially roller coaster enthusiasts, who will miss Rolling Thunder,’ Siebeneicher said. The park says technology has surpassed the dual track coaster, which opened in 1979 and has become a beloved classic. Zumanjaro is scheduled to open in summer 2014. Thrill . ride developers at Busch Gardens acknowledge that the park's newest . attraction might not be everyone's idea of a good time. Falcon's . Fury opens on May 1, and riders will be seated upright and whisked to the . top of a 335-foot tower, then the seat will pivot 90 degrees so the . guest is looking straight down. That's when the ride plunges in a six-second free fall. Jeff . Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said . riders will reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour on the plunge. 'It's . a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster,' said Hornick. 'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it . or not want to ride it at all.' An artist's impression shows how Falcon's Fury will look: The ride will seat riders upright, take them to the top of a 335-foot tower, then pivot seats 90 degrees so riders face straight down as they plunge 60 mph in a six-second free fall . Park . officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North . America as while Luther and Zumanjaro are taller they are both integrated with other rides or buildings. 'Drop . towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you . see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for . innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld . Magazine. 'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic . attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. Putting . riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is . definitely a new take on this type of ride. Falcon's . Fury stands alone, and Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and . even St. Petersburg some 30 miles away once at the top. Guests . must be 54 inches tall to ride.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A British couple have told how their dream holiday turned into a nightmare when they were evicted from Kenya just one day into their trip after the country was rocked by bombings. Neil Allison and his wife, from Redcar, Yorkshire, had their break cut short after the Foreign Office warned against travelling to beach resorts along the coast. They were among about 400 UK holidaymakers travel firms brought home after the country was put on terror alert. Nightmare trip: Neil Allison, who was flown out of Kenya just one day of his holiday with his wife . The scene after back-to-back bomb blasts which have killed at least 10 people in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi . The couple, who flew from Gatwick on Monday for a week's holiday at Diani Beach resort - an hour away from Mombasa – were told on Tuesday by their rep that that they were being evicted. Following the warning, two explosions in the Kenyan capital Nairobi killed at least 13 people and injured around 70 others. Although Mr and Mrs Allison had another 24 hours in the east African country before they flew home, they said they were too scared to leave their hotel. Neil, a senior operative for a housing company, said: ‘I didn't sleep that night, I just paced up and down the beach and watched the sun rise. Fears: British tourists queue at Mombasa Airport in Kenya after a change in Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice prompted travel companies to bring them home . Protection: Armed guards waited as holidaymakers prepared to board a charter flight following a recent spate of terror attacks . A‘There were armed police everywhere and we travelled in coach convoy to the airport with a security guard on the coach and an armed escort. It's just not what we're used to. ‘We would never normally see armed police.’ Neil, 45, who has a nine-year-old son, added: ‘We had just booked a trip to go on safari for Thursday but instead we ended up coming home. ‘It was pretty frightening at the time especially with little information on what was going on - and I don't scare easily.’ The bombs exploded near Gikomba Market, which is four miles away from Westgate Shopping Mall, where 67 people were killed in September . Tour operators Thomson and First Choice cancelled all flights to Mombasa until October and said 400 holidaymakers would be flown back. The couple had flown with Thomson and Neil said that it was the right decision to remove holidaymakers when they did. ‘When we got to Gatwick I asked some of the reporters gathered at the airport what was going on but no one knew,’ he said. It was only once they were on the train home to Redcar that they found out about the bombings. ‘We were just so relieved to get home. It hasn't put us off going back though. We'd still like to go on safari and the people there are lovely, so friendly and happy but we would definitely wait until things have calmed down.’ Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have cancelled all flights to Kenya until the end of October as a result of the concerns . Luxury: The coastal city of Mombasa is popular with British tourists, but many have had dream holidays cut short . The death toll figure was given by the . Kenyan National Disaster Operations Centre (NDOC) which added that one . suspect had been arrested. The blasts - around 1pm UK time - follow terrorist attacks earlier this month in and around the coastal town of Mombasa. These . incidents prompted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to amend . its Kenya travel advice. The new advice warned against all but essential . travel to parts of Mombasa. Tour . operators Thomson and First Choice cancelled all flights to Mombasa . until October and said 400 holidaymakers would be flown back. The main threat has been linked to the militant Islamist al-Shabab group. Where exactly have tourists been warned they cannot go? The latest advice for tourists is to avoid all but essential travel to Mombasa Island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek, north of the city, and Tiwi in the south. However, the warning does not include the popular beach resort of Diani or Moi international airport, which is the gateway to the coast. I have a holiday booked on Kenya’s coast, will it be cancelled? Tour operators will cancel any holidays that are based in the areas that have now been declared off-limits. They are not obliged to cancel trips to other parts of Kenya. However, some companies, such as Thomson and First Choice, have also evacuated holidaymakers from Diani, which is not included in the latest advice. Therefore it is advisable to contact your holiday company to see what its policy is. My holiday has been cancelled, what are my rights? Rest assured, if you have booked through a tour operator you are entitled to a full refund or you will be offered an alternative trip. Customers who have booked flights and accommodation separately should expect to be refunded as long as their accommodation is . If you have booked your trip independently and have travel insurance it should pay out for any trips cancelled due to changing travel advice. Always make sure you check your policy closely.I am booked for a safari holiday and am not going near the south coast, will my trip still go ahead? Tour operators offering trips to areas that are not affected by the latest travel update will go ahead as usual.What if I have a holiday to Kenya booked but don’t want to go following this news?Unless your trip is to one of the affected areas which tourists have been advised to avoid then your booking still stands. Companies in general will not allow customers to cancel bookings to other parts of the country which are still considered safe according to government organisations.Where is considered safe? Almost all of the rest of Kenya, including popular safari areas, is considered safe. The only new areas tourists have been told to avoid are Mombasa island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek in the north down to and including Tiwi in the south. Long-standing advice about non-essential travel includes areas within 37 miles of the Kenya –Somali border, Kiwayu Island and coastal areas north of Pate Island (in the south east of the country), the Garissa district (in the east), the Eastleigh area of Nairobi and the slum areas of the Kenyan capital.","Neil Allison and his wife had their trip cut short due to bombings .

Southampton are reported to be considering an approach for the Derby head coach after Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham and took his backroom staff with him. But McClaren is happy at the iPro Stadium and focussed on the summer transfer window with preparations underway for the coming campaign following play-off heartbreak. Gut-wrenching: Steve McClaren's Derby were undone by an injury-time winner from Bobby Zamora . Commitment: McClaren says he wants to stay with Derby . Derby came agonisingly close to promotion but were undone by Bobby Zamora’s late strike for Queens Park Rangers at Wembley. McClaren has forged a strong relationship with his squad and supporters after replacing Nigel Clough last September and has serious ambitions for automatic promotion next year. The interest from Southampton is understandable given the way in which McClaren solidified his reputation for innovative coaching and trusting in youth last season - matching the blueprint at St Mary's. But the job at Derby is very much unfinished and the 53-year-old, alongside assistants Paul Simpson and Eric Steele,  wants to be the one to complete it. He has two years left on his contract. George Thorne, the 21-year-old on loan from West Bromwich Albion who shone in the play-off final, is the club’s prime transfer target. Brought in at the end of January he quickly became a vital player but his performances might have convinced West Brom to retain his services or alerted other Premier League sides to his ability.","Steve McClaren happy at the iPro Stadium after a remarkable turnaround with the East Midlands club .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Late fees could be the least of your worries next time you borrow a book from the local library. A Belgian professor borrowed the most popular books from a library in Antwerp and tested them for bacteria, microbes and other substances. He discovered traces of cocaine across all of most borrowed books, with the copy of erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey even testing positive for the herpes virus. A professor from the Catholic University of Leuven tested the most borrowed books from a Belgian library, stock image of a library pictured, using bacteriology and toxicology tests. Each of the 10 most popular books tested positive for cocaine, while Fifty Shades of Grey tested positive for the herpes virus . Fifty Shades of Grey is a trilogy of books written by British writer E.L James. More than 70 million copies of the book have been sold worldwide since it was launched two years ago. It divided opinion because it detailed a . love affair between a publishing graduate and a company CEO. A number of scenes were erotic and involved sadomasochist acts which some readers found offensive. Despite this, the book was rated the best-selling book of all time in a 2012 poll by the Telegraph newspaper. The book is currently being adapted into a movie directed by Sam Taylor-Wood, set to be released in February 2015. It is set to star Dakota Johnson as the female protagonist Anastasia Steele alongside Jamie Dornan as the male lead Christian Grey. The research was carried out by toxicologist professor Jan Tytgat from the Catholic University of Leuven. He decided to test the most borrowed books from Antwerp lending library using bacteriology and toxicology tests. Tytgat told Flanders News that the level of cocaine found on each book wasn’t enough to get readers of the borrowed book high, yet was significant enough to make them test positive for the drug. The type of herpes virus was found on the copy of Fifty Shades of Grey was herpes simplex virus type 1 - a strain of herpes that causes cold sores. The traces of herpes found on the copy of British author E.L James’  book were equally low enough not to cause any harm: . ‘The levels found won't have a pharmacological effect,’ explained Tytgat. ‘Your consciousness or behaviour won't change as a result of reading the tomes,’ Tytgat continued. The professors insisted that the traces were minimal, did not pose a public health risk and added it would be ‘impossible for people to contract it by touching the book.’ The findings were similar to research carried out by Brigham Young University in 2011. Fifty Shades of Grey is a trilogy of books written by British writer E.L James. More than 70 million copies of the book have sold worldwide since it was launched two years ago.

"By . John Drayton . Will Real Madrid retain the Champions League? Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has hailed the attitude of Gareth Bale after the Welshman scored the decisive goal that lifted the Spanish giants to Champions League glory. With a pulsating final between city rivals Real and Atletico Madrid finely poised at 1-1, Bale struck five minutes into the second period of extra time to break the hearts of the recently-crowned Primera Division champions. Having missed several chances throughout normal time, including a clear cut opportunity when through on goal when the tie was still goalless, Bale held his nerve to steer a header into an empty net after Angel di Maria had seen his initial shot saved by Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. VIDEO Scroll down to see footage of Real Madrid's celebrations in Madrid . Finals: Gareth Bale's goal was his second in as many cup finals for Real Madrid . Champion: Carlo Ancelotti equalled Bob Paisley's record for winning the Champions League three times . His persistence impressed Ancelotti, who said: ""It was very important because he had tried before, but he was unlucky in front of goal. 'But he turned up when he was needed.' It is the second time that Bale has scored the winner in a cup final in his first season with Real, with his solo goal against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey earning rave reviews. Bale's strikes in showpiece encounters will go a long way to silencing the critics that doubted his ability to live up to his world record £85.3million price tag, and Ancelotti is confident the former Southampton and Tottenham midfielder is capable of improvement. 'All season Gareth has been good and he will be better next year,' Ancelotti added. Welsh pride: Gareth Bale (centre) became the first Welshman to score in a Champions League final . La Decima: Ancelotti became the coach to deliver the fabled tenth European Cup for Real Madrid . Marcelo's strike and Cristiano Ronaldo's penalty gave the scoreline a rather flattering look as Real claimed a 4-1 victory and finally sealed the dream of 'La Decima', their 10th European Cup triumph. 'We're very proud of having won this for all Madrid fans,' Ancelotti said. 'Happiness is giving happiness to those who always follow us. The fans are very happy and that makes us happy. 'I have had a fantastic group of players who have always been professional and they showed that in this match too. Not only those who were delighted to be playing, but also those who were not playing. 'We've worked hard this season to achieve this.' Goals: Marcelo (left) and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) both scored crucial goals in extra-time . Atletico had looked on course for a famous double as, having wrapped up the La Liga title last week, they took a 36th-minute lead on Saturday night through Diego Godin's header. Yet their failure to double their lead ensured they were on the back foot for much of the final half hour and their defence was finally breached in the third minute of added-on time when Sergio Ramos headed home from a corner. From then on, there was only going to be one winner, with several Atletico players showing visible signs of fatigue, yet boss Simeone, who was involved in an ugly on-field spat with Real defender Raphael Varane before the final whistle, was proud of his players. 'This fixture doesn't deserve one tear, when you give your life, there's nothing to say,' he said. 'It's part of the game. You can win, you can lose. Today we lost but know that we gave everything. That exalts us and gives us the ability to continue growing.' The Argentinian added: 'Now we rest, we have summer to restart and work in the same way.

"New government says it needs $35 billion aid in next two years . Russia have withdrawn vital funding from Kiev creating economic crisis . Chancellor: 'UK willing to pour in taxpayers’ money to help government' By . Tim Shipman . George Osborne offered the Ukraine a blank cheque last night to turn the ravaged country around . Ukraine's new government today said it needs a massive $35 billion aid package over this year and next to keep its economy from collapse. It asked for the cash because Russia will no longer support it after the ousting of president Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Moscow. The plea was issued within hours of George Osborne saying that British taxpayers' money would be available - and saying: 'We should be there with a chequebook to help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country."" But Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, cautioned against unconditional help, saying the new government had to strike a proper agreement with the International Monetary Fund and stick by it. ""As you know in Ukraine we have a long . record of agreements that have not been honoured,"" Sikorski, one of the . European Union's mediators in the Ukraine crisis, told a news . conference. ""There is a huge amount of macroeconomic assistance . available for Ukraine as soon as Ukraine concludes an agreement with the . IMF."" Ukraine now says it needs $35 billion (£21 billion) to keep its economy from collapse. Russia has withdrawn financial support . The European Union today said it had started contact with the United States, Japan, China, Canada and Turkey on coordinating aid for Ukraine. A senior official said that it could organise a donors' conference - a meeting of countries wealthy enough and willing to give cash - to raise short-term funding for Ukraine, which has said it needs $35 billion to survive 2014 and 2015. ""A donors' conference as the situation stabilises would be one way (to help Ukraine),"" the official told Reuters.

""Ukraine's financial situation is very serious and without outside assistance may not be sustainable. An economic crisis in Ukraine would be a grave threat to the country's stability and have damaging wider consequences,"" Mr Hague said. Earlier, at a meeting of G20 finance . ministers in Australia, Mr Osborne said: ‘We are here ready to help . just as soon as there is someone at the end of the telephone. 'We should be there with a chequebook to help the people of Ukraine rebuild their country.’ It was unclear how much cash might be provided but Britain is . likely to contribute to stability funds being put together by the .

Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine no longer has access to a £9billion handout . from Moscow.

Ukraine may need a bailout since it . has a dire ‘CCC’ credit rating, but British taxpayers may not take . kindly to assisting a country with huge natural resources including oil, . whose former president spent millions on a vulgar palace while his . people suffered.

She said: ‘If it needs policy advice, financial . support and wants to actually undertake a reform of its economy the IMF . will help.’ One claim was that he was holed up in a bunker accompanied by loyal armed guards, another that he was ensconced in the home of a crony in the east of the country. The disgraced and powerless president even failed in a bid to bribe Ukrainian border guards to allow his chartered aircraft to fly from Donetsk airport to an unknown destination in Russia. ‘The top public official made an attempt to fly abroad,’ said spokesman Serhii Astakhov. ‘This charter was not planned  in advance. ‘When border guards arrived for the formalisation procedures they were met by an armed group of men, who offered them a bribe to allow departure without the proper paperwork for flying abroad. The border guards refused.’ Yanukovych then left the plane and got into a car, according to Ukraine’s new interior minister Arsen Avakov, who said the fugitive president ‘headed in an unknown direction’.

Paperwork found at the president’s abandoned mansion is expected to mean he would face a criminal probe for corruption. It was far from clear last night whether Russian President Vladimir Putin wanted to see his former ally enter Russia. In Kiev, bickering started among the pro-Western politicians who came to power on a tidal wave of popular discontent – with many opposed to freed ex-premier Yulia Tymoshenko’s bid to become president. And there were alarming signs of pressure for secession in the pro-Russian East, fuelled by nationalistic rhetoric from senior Moscow figures amid fears that the country could sink into civil war.

The new administration now says it needs $35 billion between now and next year to keep its economy from collapse. In Crimea, hundreds queued to join a ‘self-defence’ brigade in an area which has so far refused to accept parliament’s authority in Kiev. In Kharkiv, the city to which Yanukovych had fled, some 3,000 ‘defenders’ barricaded themselves around a statue of Lenin vowing to resist the control of the new authorities. And the Ukrainian flag was lowered from the mayor’s office in Kerch – and the Russian flag raised instead. Russian politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky last night claimed eastern Ukraine should rejoin Russia, with Moscow ‘switching off the gas’ to the rest of the country.

They have not paid since September. ‘And we should not give any money. We should claim back $2billion, and that’s it.’ Yanukovych’s own party  yesterday disowned him in a statement saying: ‘We are experiencing one of the most difficult and tragic periods in our country’s history. ‘Ukraine has been deceived and robbed, but even this is nothing next to the grief that has afflicted dozens of Ukrainian families on both sides of the confrontation … Ukraine was betrayed … . ‘All responsibility for this lies with Yanukovych and his  close entourage.’","New government says it needs $35 billion aid in next two years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The former student who killed six people in a vengeful rampage in Santa Barbara had told a friend he wanted to hold down and rape women, the friend's mother has revealed. Cathleen Bloeser's son was a childhood friend of killer Elliot Rodger and was among the 30 people who received his sick manifesto by email just seconds before he carried out the murders. In the 141-page document, 22-year-old Rodger described how he was going to kill his housemates, then slaughter women at a sorority house before opening fire on the streets of Isla Vista. He explained that he was driven to kill after numerous women had rejected him. 'We could see that he was turning,' Mrs Bloeser said. 'He'd changed emotionally, and he'd become very despondent and he wanted . to get back at people.' Scroll down for video . Killer: Elliot Rodger, pictured, told friends he had thoughts of raping women, family friends said . It comes as new details, reported by the National Post on Monday, reveal that, at the beginning of Friday's rampage, Rodger had pounded on the front door of the Alpha Phi sorority house with the intention of opening fire - but no one answered. Several women heard Rodger's 'aggressive knocking,' Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. 'Fortunately, no one opened.' Instead, he walked around the corner and opened fire on a group of students outside - shooting three, two of whom died. He then went on to kill another student and injure many more. Mrs Bloeser said that within the last year, his mental health had deteriorated and he was under psychiatric care but not taking his medication at the time of the spree. She said Rodger, who had spoken to her son Philip and another one of his friends about wanting to sexually assault women, had invited her son over to stay at his home over the weekend. But he and another childhood friend did not stay at the apartment. On Saturday, Rodger's two roommates and another male friend were found there stabbed to death. Escape: Philip Bloeser, a childhood friend of Rodger's, had been invited to stay at his home the weekend he went on his rampage, his mother told reporters. He also received the manifesto via email . Relief: Bloeser's mother (right) said her son could've been shot if he had agreed to go to the killer's home . 'I have a feeling that they would have been right there as a part of it and shot as well,' she said. Moments after sending the manifesto to his mother, father, former teachers and friends, Rodger went on his shooting spree. Family . friend Simon Astaire told Reuters that Rodger's mother, Chin, had also received a phone call on the night of the shooting from his therapist . alerting her to the manifesto. She . called police and her ex-husband, Peter Rodger, and the two parents . raced to Isla Vista - but she heard radio reports about the shootings as . she drove. As well as emailing the 30 people his manifesto, he also shared his hate for women in a video posted online called Elliot Rodger's Retribution. He unleashed a tirade about his 'loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires,' and blamed women for preferring 'obnoxious brutes' to him, 'the supreme gentleman'. Victims: Rodger's victims included his roommates Weihan Wang, left, and Cheng Yuan Hong, right, who were found dead inside his apartment.

Loss: Katie Cooper, left, and Veronika Weiss . were standing outside a sorority house when they were shot . 'I'm 22 years old and I'm still a virgin. I've never even kissed a girl,' he said in the video. 'College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. But in those years I've had to rot in loneliness. It's not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me. But I will punish you all for it.' He repeatedly promised to 'punish' women and lays out his plan for 'retribution' in the video. On Friday, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, acted upon his threats, killing six people before shooting himself dead. Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared with him. The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there. Scene: Rodger's black BMW can be seen after he crashed it into a cyclist and parked cars after he shot at passersby from the window. He was shot by a police officer before taking his own life . Rodger then climbed into his SUV and drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority house, where he shot dead Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19. He then got back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened fire. There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack that was captured on surveillance footage. The gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at passersby as he drove, hitting three pedestrians before he police officers returned fire and shot him in the hip. He tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist, before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars. When police found his body, he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally.","Elliot Rodger, 22, stabbed three friends in his California home then shot three more in shooting rampage before killing himself .

"By . Louise Cheer . Finding the perfect dress can be hard but according to experts this $299 dress ticks all the boxes. Designer Sacha Drake has taken style tips from experts in recruitment, dating and colour theory to create the burgundy frock. It is meant to score women the trifecta - the man, the job and the perfect body. The outfit's capped sleeves hides the most unattractive part of the body - the armpits - and the neckline and shape of the dress frames the face and skims over the body instead of clinging to it. Experts have given this Sacha Drake dress the tick of approval. The colour red is meant to exude confidence, passion and power . Colour theorist Dr Zena O'Connor said dark red was the ideal colour to wear on a first date. She said it conveyed confidence, power and passion - what men love in a woman - as well as making the wearer appear slimmer. 'Red is the colour of romance but by choosing a darker tone the message changes from lust to dependability,' Dr O'Connor, from the College of Fine Arts, told The Daily Telegraph. More...

"By . Iain Rogers, Reuters . Forward Gerard Deulofeu is not thinking about going to the World Cup with Spain but wants to learn from his new team mates after a surprise call-up for Friday’s warm-up match against Bolivia. The 20-year-old spent an injury-disrupted season on loan at Premier League team Everton last term before returning to parent club Barcelona and Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has included him in the squad for the game in Seville. He has been brought in to cover for the injured Jesus Navas as the world and European champions warm up for the defence of their title at the finals, which start in Brazil next month. Esteemed company: Gerard Deulofeu is eager to learn off his Spain team-mates after his call-up . Preparations: But the young winger admits he's not expecting to go to the World Cup this summer . Del Bosque has until June 2 to name his definitive list of 23 players for the finals. 'I’m not thinking about going to Brazil,' Deulofeu told a news conference at Spain’s training base outside Madrid on Tuesday. 'I have to enjoy this week that’s been given to me and learn from these great players,' he added. 'After that we’ll see what happens. Navas is injured and that puts me a bit closer to going, but I’m not thinking about that. There are very good players available and no one knows what will happen in the future. 'I’ve been given a chance with the Spanish national team and I expect to take advantage of it.' Deulofeu, a Spain Under-21 international who has yet to play for the senior side, made 29 appearances for Everton last season, scoring four goals. Impressive: Deulofeu made positive strides forward on loan at Everton this season . He said he had learned a lot at Everton but was happy to return to Barca, where he was a member of the Catalan club’s academy. 'It was a good experience (in England),' he said. 'I learned a lot, both as a footballer and a person. I had some bad luck with injuries that kept me out for two months. 'I think I could have given more of myself but I’m happy to come home - that was my objective. Now it’s time to work for Barca.'","Deulofeu: I'm not think about going to Brazil, I'm here to learn .

The devastated father of one of virgin killer Elliot Rodger’s victims has revealed that he discovered his daughter was dead using an iPhone tracking app. Veronika Weiss was preparing for a charity event on Friday night when she was confronted by the gunman outside of her sorority house on the UCSB campus in Isla Vista. Weiss, a first-year student, together with Katie Cooper from the Delta Delta Delta sorority were brutally gunned down at close range by Rodger. Devastated father Bob Weiss has revealed that he discovered his daughter Veronika, 19, was one of the victims of Friday's shooting spree by using an iPhone tracking app . Bob Weiss rushed to the campus, but was unable to get confirmation of Veronika's condition, he checked her phone and made the chilling discovery that the signal was coming from the middle of the crime scene . Once Veronika’s father, Bob Weiss, had heard about the shootings on the news he tried to call his daughter to check she was okay. When he didn’t heard from her, he used an iPhone tracking app to see if they could locate her. To his horror, it placed his daughter right in the middle of the crime scene. Weiss and his wife’s rushed to the scene, but unable to get confirmation of Veronika’s condition, he checked her phone again and made a chilling discovery. ‘We got to the border of the crime scene and we turned it on again,’ Weiss told KING5. Veronika Weiss was preparing for a charity event on Friday night when she was confronted by Elliot Rodger outside of her sorority house on the UCSB campus in Isla Vista . Flowers, photos and a note adorn a sidewalk memorial for Veronika Weiss, who along with Katie Cooper were two of the victims of a shooting rampage by Elliott Rodger, outside the Delta Phi sorority house in Isla Vista . ‘We could actually see the phone moving which we assume was Veronika Weiss's body being moved to the coroner's truck.’ Bob Weiss said he felt more sad than angry by what has happened. He also paid tribute to his daughter’s spirit. ‘She was fierce,’ he said. ‘She was strong. She was smart. She had a great sense of who she was and she took on everything.’ Weiss, 19, was a first-year student from Westlake Village, California. At Westlake High School she had been a water polo player who earned league honors during her senior year. On Friday night Rodger had pounded on the front door of the Delta Delta Delta sorority house, when no one answered he was forced to improvise.

He ran around the corner right into the face of these girls and just started firing on them. My guess is at very close range,' said Weiss. Next Rodger jumped into his black BMW to continue his spree.

"By . Anna Edwards . The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised after the Church of England did not take her allegations of abuse seriously and 'badly let her down'. The new Archbishop, Justin Welby, made a personal apology as a senior Church of England cleric was suspended. The Bishop of Winchester Tim Dakin suspended the Dean of Jersey, the Very Rev Robert Key, yesterday following a critical independent report into the 2008 complaint by the woman of abusive behaviour by a churchwarden in Jersey. The Archbishop of Canterbury offered personal apologies following the suspension of the Very Rev Robert Key (right) was handled . The report, commissioned by the Diocese of Winchester's Safeguarding Panel, raised concerns that the dean did not take the complaint seriously. He also showed a perceived lack of neutrality, offered poor communication and failed to act in relation to the parishioner. The archbishop said in a statement: 'The Bishop of Winchester's swift, decisive and wholly necessary actions following his receipt of this report are to be commended. 'I too wish to add my own personal apologies to the young woman who was so badly let down by those she had turned to for help and I wholeheartedly support the investigation that the bishop has launched. He must receive full co-operation from all involved. 'We cannot place a high enough importance on safeguarding issues and it is vital that lessons are learned from this case, not just in Jersey but throughout the whole of the Church of England. 'Every day, the vulnerable come to us for shelter, for support and for comfort. 'Their trust cannot be taken for granted.' The Bishop of Winchester has begun an investigation into the conduct of the case by the dean, who is the most senior C of E cleric on the Channel island, and other matters raised by the report. The Rt Rev Dakin, who is responsible for the Church of England in the Channel Islands, also apologised to the woman for her treatment. The States of Jersey Police and Hampshire Constabulary did investigate the allegations in 2008 but found that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. The diocese has sent the police a copy of the independent report.",The Dean of Jersey is accused of not taking a claim seriously .
"By . Becky Evans . Ice-cream vans can play their chimes for longer after the Government relaxed rules for operators for the first time in 31 years. Van drivers will be allowed to play their famous songs, such as Greensleeves or Teddy Bears Picnic, for up to 12 seconds at a time - instead of the previous four. Vendors can also chime every two minutes while driving, up from just one every three minutes. Ice-cream van drivers can now play music every two minutes and for up to 12 seconds at a time . The announcement yesterday by the Department for Education and Rural Affairs will be seen as a victory for ice-cream van vendors, who have struggled in recent years. But frustratingly for operators, the changes will not be implemented until after the summer, meaning they cannot capitalise during their busiest months. The changes to the Code of Practice on Noise From Ice Cream Vans means drivers will also be able to chime once when they are parked for the first time. However, the Government decided not to extend the hours of chiming. Allowing music to be played until 8pm had been considered but was scrapped after strong opposition from The Noise Abatement Society. The Government said it was a 'particularly contentious issue'. The rules will not come until after the summer, meaning drivers cannot capitalise during their busiest months . Sales of 99s and cornets have hit a record low. In the past three years, traditional cones and other stick lollies have dropped by almost a third. Rising prices have also contributed to the drop. Only one in four people will buy ice-creams from a van. In 2010 the figure was 40 per cent, The Telegraph report. Ice-cream tub sales have hit 333million litres but market research analyst Mintel said they expect that to fall by nine per cent by 2017. The . department also decided not to scrap the code altogether after a . consultation, in which just 35 members of the public responded. Van drivers will also not be able to chime . within 165 feet of schools, hospitals or places of worship and no more . than once every two hours on the same street. The Noise Abatement Society opposed any change to the code, saying it 'establishes a balance between noise . makers and noise sufferers'. However, the ice-cream van industry backed making the little-known clause of the Control of Pollutions Act 1974 less restrictive, which it is hoped will help drivers advertise themselves better. Since the 1950s, the number of vans on . the road has dropped from 20,000 to just a quarter of that figure, . according to the Nationwide Caterers Association. The decline is partially down to a reliance on warm weather, but also ice-cream vans have been targeted by health campaigners. The . cost of running a van has also escalated. Buying a new vehicle can cost . more than £60,000, while people pay £12,000 for a second hand van. Many . local authorities also stopped vans from operating near schools, which . the NCA said 'hit dying businesses run by lone men in vans, while the . supermarkets carry on selling choc ices in value packs.' The consultation into the code came after the Government launched the Red Tape Challenge, a campaign to review all potentially unnecessary business regulation in April 2011.","Drivers can now play music for up to 12 seconds instead of previous four .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Two teenage boys have been jailed for beating a man into a coma because they 'didn’t value his life'. Kane Price, 15, and Ashley Farrow, 17, used a wooden chair leg to beat their victim before leaving him for dead. Homeless Vladimirs Kazlausks, 54, was sleeping in a shopping centre underpass in Newport, South Wales, when the two boys launched their brutal attack - which left him close to death and blind in one eye. The attack mirrored a disturbing scene from cult movie A Clockwork Orange, which was banned for 27 years. Thugs: Kane Price (left) and Ashley Farrow were today sentenced for their part in a savage and premeditated attack on a sleeping homeless man, Vladimir Kazlausks . Horrific: Vladimir Kazlausks, pictured, was beaten into a coma by the two thugs, who also blinded him in one eye . Price and Farrow tried to put the blame on each other for the vicious attack on May 8. But they were both found unanimously guilty of grievous bodily harm by a jury in November. Price, a schoolboy at the time of the attack, was sent to a young offenders institute for seven-and-a-half years. Farrow, who is now 18, was sent to a young offenders institute for six years. Cardiff Crown Court heard how Mr Kazlausks was discovered unconscious and 'soaked' in his own blood. He was in a coma for a week, but miraculously survived despite suffering multiple fractures to his face and eye sockets. The . two boys were spotted on CCTV at the time of the attack and their . tracksuit trousers and shoes were found to be spattered with blood. The court heard the pair, both from Newport, South Wales, fled after the senseless attack and later met with up with friends. Young: The baby-faced boys - Price left and Farrow right - attacked the vulnerable man while he slept in an underpass, the court heard . Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'It was a brutal and gratuitous attack by two young boys on a vulnerable homeless man. 'With repeated use of a wooden chair leg they tried to kill him and left him for dead. They didn’t value his life.'Farrow told one friend they had done something big. 'Price then said: “I have killed someone - it was mental”. He said he had attacked a man in the head with some wood and that after that he stopped making noises. 'He said it was a crackhead asleep on the floor. They were boasting about what they had done.' Judge Robert Jay took the unusual step . of naming and shaming Price and Farrow because of the ferocity of their . late-night attack at Cardiff Crown Court today. Following an application from members of . the press, Mr Justice Jay decided to lift the Section 39 Order on . Price - which had prevented the media from revealing his identity. Although . previously being granted anonymity during his trial, Farrow turned 18 . late last month - meaning reporting restrictions no longer applied to . him. Violent: The attack by the two teenage boys mirrored a scene in the 1971 film 'A Clockwork Orange', pictured . Despite mitigation from defence . counsels, Mr Justice Jay said he regarded both youths as 'dangerous' and . would be 'imposing extended sentences'. Sentencing, Judge . Jay told the two young boys: 'You treated your victim as beneath . contempt - both show a worrying complete lack of human empathy. 'You both know what you did that evening - although you are continuing to deny it. 'The victim was completely helpless and couldn’t have found himself in a more exposed position. 'You both regarded him as easy game but the law treats everyone as being equally deserving of respect and dignity. 'What happened is a wooden implement was picked up and the victim was savagely beaten around the head with it. In the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange a young gang beat a tramp senseless for singing drunkenly in an underpass. The film was later banned by its director Stanley Kubrick because there were fears it encouraged gratuitous copycat attacks. After . being released from intensive care a week after the attack Mr Kazlausks . said he wished he was dead and felt his life was 'finished'. 'We cannot be sure how many times he was struck but it was probably not the 40 times you, Kane Price, boasted to your friends. 'The victim was left for dead, you thought he might be dead and he certainly might’ve died.' Blood from Mr Kazlausks was found on a shoe of the eldest boy, while eyewitnesses said they saw the youngest with blood on his face and tracksuit top sleeve afterwards. They tried to explain away those damning bits of evidence by saying they were only mere observers to what their friend had done and were too 'shocked' and 'frightened' to intervene. However, Judge Mr Justice Jay said forensic evidence showed that the younger of the two boys - Price - was the ringleader and had been the one who hit Mr Kazlausks over the head with a wooden table leg. He added: 'I am also satisfied that that this attack was not a spur of the moment (decision). 'Ashley Farrow, although your involvement was lesser, everything points to this being committed to this enterprise. Kane Price..... you lied to the jury on a truly epic scale.' The court ruled that both teenagers will . only be eligible for parole after two-thirds of their detention had . passed. And in order for them to be released on licence, the pair would . have to prove they were no longer a danger to the public.","Kane Price, 15, and Ashley Farrow, 17, attacked victim with chair leg .

"By . Sue Reid . A young couple whose pictures were placed on the Interpol website after they fled abroad to hide their baby from social workers have promised never to return  to Britain. Yunus Chhatbar and Safiya Reheman have accused their local council of trying to remove their son, now nine months old, and put him up for adoption. The British-born couple flew to Northern Cyprus last autumn and were the subject of an international alert when their names and photos were placed on the missing persons’ section of the Interpol website. On the run: Yunus Chhatbar (left) and Safiya Reheman have fled to Northern Cyprus to hide their baby Momo from social workers in Leicester . But until a ruling made in the Family Division of the High Court, they could not be identified because of the secrecy surrounding the family courts. At the hearing Mr Chhatbar, 29, told the judge via videolink that they had bought a ‘one-way ticket’ to Northern Cyprus, which has broken away from Cyprus and has no extradition treaty with Britain and does not recognise UK law. The couple, who formerly lived in Leicester, renew their 90-day visitors’ visas by going to the border with Cyprus and getting their papers stamped without leaving the safety of Northern Cyprus. They can carry on doing this indefinitely, they say. Leicester City Council social workers argue that their son Abdurrahman, known as Momo, must be returned to the UK where he is still ‘habitually resident’ because of his parents’ social and family links. The judge Mr Justice Mostyn said that the couple, who met two years ago, could be breaking the law by refusing to bring their child back. But over the videolink from Northern Cyprus, Mr Chhatbar told him: ‘Good luck in trying to find us. I do not believe your court has jurisdiction over us. We are never coming back to England.’ Financial adviser Mr Chhatbar and travel agent Miss Reheman, 19, fled after a relative made an allegation to Leicester city council social services that Mr Chhatbar had a violent past. Search: The picture of Momo and his mother used on the Interpol website . It is a claim the couple vigorously deny, but social workers warned them to split up so Momo could live with Miss Reheman in safety or else they would seize the baby. Last Friday the family’s story was recounted during an extraordinary hearing in London when the couple backed an application by the Daily Mail to lift reporting restrictions on the case. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be ‘absurd’ to impose a reporting ban because the family’s details were already on the Interpol website. The judge emphasised at the beginning of the hearing that it was not being heard in secret. Waiving the couple and baby’s anonymity in a ground-breaking ruling, he said again later: ‘I have explained repeatedly this is not a secret court.’ It was an important decision because the Mail has vigorously campaigned against family court cases being held behind closed doors. Often, strict reporting restrictions are imposed against the wishes of parents or family members who appear there. Last night Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who has demanded more openness in the family courts, said: ‘Many, many families are escaping abroad to avoid having their children taken by social services which like a veil of secrecy in these courts because it hides any wrong decisions, of which there are many, by them.’ Speaking from Northern Cyprus yesterday, Miss Reheman said: ‘The social workers said that if I stayed with Yunus they would take our newborn son into care and get him adopted in less than four months. ‘I was scared they would take Momo so we decided to make the move to Northern Cyprus. ‘A few days later the social services found out we had gone. They went to the family court and were granted orders to recover Momo, and make him a ward of court without our knowledge. It meant the state officially became his “parents” and we were being treated like our own baby’s abductors. ‘We were horrified when we found out our son’s picture was plastered all over the Interpol website alongside criminals, terrorists and murderers who are on the run. ‘We have been forced to live like fugitives, but we cannot let them take our son.’ The family have rented a flat in Northern Cyprus, where Miss Reheman lived for two years as a child. She added: ‘We want to settle here so Momo is safe with us for ever. Why would we return to a country that wants to take your baby and give him to strangers?’ In court the barrister for Leicester social services said they still want Momo brought back to Britain. Another hearing is scheduled in a month’s time.","Yunus Chhatbar and Safiya Reheman have accused Leicester City Council of trying to remove their son Momo and put him up for adoption .

"By . Mark Duell . Sophisticated gangs of thieves prowling Britain's streets to steal dogs to order are identifying their victims - by daubing the letter 'K' on their driveways, police revealed yesterday. Lookouts are leaving the 'K' code in crayon or spray paint after finding valuable dogs worth stealing and selling in unwitting owners' gardens in the Alsager area, north of Stoke-on-Trent, Cheshire. The burglars then return later and take the animals in a online black market trade that is said to be earning criminal gangs hundreds of thousands of pounds. At risk: The online black market trade of dogs that have been stolen from gardens is said to be netting criminal gangs hundreds of thousands of pounds (file picture) The latest incidents of the 'K' code - believed to be a play on the word 'Canine' - were highlighted by Cheshire Police officers who are investigating thefts in Alsager. Gangs are stealing either pedigree dogs to sell to unwitting buyers online or mutts they can use in illegal dog fights. Pedigree dogs are sold on the black market for up to £2,000 each. Experts say an estimated 3,500 thefts were reported in the UK last year - an increase of around 17 per cent on the previous 12 months. Now police are urging residents to watch out for the letter 'K' daubed on driveways, people looking in gardens or asking questions about individual dog owners. Cheshire Police Detective Sergeant Chris Pyatt said: ‘We have seen these types of markings placed outside houses before. ‘However it would appear that certain groups have started again to use this method of identifying houses that are of interest to them. We have had several reports of people acting suspiciously and asking questions to dog owners. ‘Our intelligence suggests they are targeting breeds of dogs like terriers that could be used for illegal dog fights, or for hunting. It is also possible they might sell rarer breeds on.’ Alsager Animals in Need has taken in several dogs which had previously been stolen from their owners. Co-ordinator Hilary Baxter, 75, said: ‘It's disgusting that people will go to these lengths to steal people's pets. Fortunately, because of micro-chipping, . we can trace the owners but without it there's not much chance of . tracking a dog down once it's been stolen.’ On location: Lookouts are leaving the 'K' code in crayon or spray paint . after finding valuable dogs worth stealing and selling in unwitting . owners' gardens in the Alsager area (pictured) of Cheshire . Only last month a dog-breeder suffered one of the latest pedigree dog-napping crimes - after his four prized puppies were stolen. Rob Cain, 37, was in the process of selling three of the 10-week-old Japanese akitas, and keeping the fourth for himself, when raiders broke into his home. Mr Cain, of Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, has two adult akitas and this was the second litter he has reared, with each puppy worth about £450. On March 21 he had left all six dogs in his home while popping out when thieves forced open his rear patio door and ransacked his home - taking the puppies but leaving the adult dogs. Mr Cain added: ‘My advice to other dog . owners would be to report any suspicious behaviour to the police and let . your neighbours know if you see people hanging around and acting . strangely. 'It's a horrible feeling to lose your dog. To be honest I don't think I'll ever see the puppies again' Rob Cain, 37, of Kidsgrove, Staffordshire . ‘It's a horrible feeling to lose your dog. To be honest I don't think I'll ever see the puppies again. I'm probably not going to raise another litter. This has just been too stressful. I moved here because I thought I would be safe, but after this it doesn't seem like that's the case.’ While some dogs are stolen from kennels and outhouses, thieves are getting increasingly bold - with animals being taken as they are being walked by their owners, and others being specifically targeted in burglaries. Gangs' most popular targets are trained working dogs, such as Labradors, although other popular types such as Chihuahuas and pugs also figure highly in the list of breeds stolen. The biggest rise has been in thefts of cocker spaniels, following an increase in popularity after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge adopted a puppy, Lupo. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘If people are concerned, they should make sure their pets are microchipped, gardens are secure, their dogs are monitored while in the garden and report suspicious activity to police.’ Dog Lost, a non-profit organisation that aims to reunite owners with their missing animals, told MailOnline that it does not believe stories of letters or stickers posted on driveways and gates are true. A spokesman added: 'Nevertheless we would urge all dog owners to be vigilant and not to leave their dogs in gardens or outside shops where they can be seized by dog thieves. 'The majority of dogs are stolen for monetary gain, and evidence suggests that very few are stolen to be bait dogs. The greatest increase in dog theft in the last 12 months has been in gundogs. 'The increase in theft of cocker spaniels is roughly in line with other gundogs and is not thought to relate to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ownership of one.'","Lookouts are leaving 'K' code in crayon or spray paint after finding dogs .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Unemployment has fallen by another 125,000, with a record number of women now in work. In a fresh boost for the government overall . levels of youth and long-term unemployment have also both fallen. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance also dropped to 1.22 million in January, down by 27,000 - the 15th consecutive monthly fall. The jobless total was 2.34 million in the final quarter of last year, down by 125,000, giving a rate of 7.2 per cent. The . number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance dipped to 1.22 million . in January, down by 27,000 - the 15th consecutive monthly fall. More . women are in work than at any time since records began in 1971, at just . over 14 million, today's data from the Office for National Statistics . showed. But 1.4 million . people are in part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work, a . fall of 29,000 over the latest quarter but 46,000 higher than a year . ago. Employment Minister Esther . McVey said: ‘With employment continuing to increase, it's clear that the . Government's long-term plan to build a stronger, more secure economy is . helping businesses create jobs and get people into work. ‘Record . numbers of women are in work and youth unemployment continues to fall, . which means more people have the security of a regular wage and can plan . for their future.’ Labour's flagship employment policy would only last for 12 months, the party admitted today. Every time new unemployment figures are released, Ed Miliband's party repeats its pledge of a 'jobs guarantee'. It has been described as a 'centrepiece and foundation stone of Labour's economic plan'. The policy would guarantee a job for under-25s out of work for a year or over-25s claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for two years. But today Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said it would only last for a single year. She told the BBC: 'In the first year it would help 55,000 young people and 170,000 people over the age of 25. 'That's a huge number of people, almost a quarter of a million, who would be benefiting from this policy.' Employment now stands at more than 30 million, a rate of 72.1 per cent, which is 0.6 per cent higher than a year ago. The . unemployment rate will remain a key focus, but is no longer linked to . the Bank of England's pledge to keep interest rates at record lows after . governor Mark Carney unveiled a new forward guidance policy last week. The . Bank had pledged not to consider a rate rise until unemployment fell to . 7 per cent, but with that target set to be reached much earlier than . expected, the guidance has been replaced. Average . earnings increased by 1.1 per cent in the year to December, 0.2 . percentage points up on the previous month, giving average weekly . earnings of £478. However, wage rises are still well below the 1.9 per cent rate of inflation revealed in separate figures yesterday. The . number of people out of work for longer than a year has fallen by . 45,000 to 845,000, while 451,000 have been unemployed for over two . years, down by 7,000. There were 917,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds in the latest quarter, down by 48,000 on the previous three months. Job vacancies were up by 28,000 to 580,000, the highest since 2008. However a breakdown of the figures showed that one in 10 new jobs created last year went to people born in Romania and Bulgaria, even before work restrictions were lifted, new figures revealed today. The number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK rose by 40 per cent in 12 months to December 2013. In the run-up to curbs being removed on January 1 there were almost 144,000 people born in the two countries who had a job in the UK, compared to under 102,000 in the last three months of 2012. Of the 424,503 people who found work in the 12 months to the end of last year, 41,670 were born in Romania and Bulgaria. The number of people born in Romania and Bulgaria working in the UK rose by 41 per cent year-on-year . The number of people born in Romania and Bulgaria working in Britain has risen dramatically to 144,000 . In the three months from October to December there were 30.24million people in work, up 1.4 per cent on the same time a year before. Among people born in the UK, the number in work rose by 1.1 per cent and by 3 per cent among people from the rest of the European Union. But most striking was the sharp increase in the number of people born in Romania and Bulgaria finding jobs ahead of the removal of work restrictions. There were 143,598 people from these countries working in the last quarter of 2013, up 6 per cent on July to September and up 41 per cent year-on-year. Of the 424,503 people who found work in the 12 months to the end of last year, 41,670 were born in Romania and Bulgaria. Among Romanian and Bulgarian nationals the figure was slightly lower, taking into account those born in the two countries who have changed nationality.

"By . Emily Crane . He left Australia with a giant plush toy wombat in tow but if Prince George had stayed just a few more days he might have tried to swap it for the real deal. A female wombat joey took her first steps outside at Taronga Zoo in Sydney last week. It was a spectacle that may have delighted little Prince George even more than when he was handed a toy replica by the Australian Governor-General during the royal tour last month. The Duchess of Cambridge revealed late in the tour that the Prince was 'obsessed with wombats at the moment' after she was handed a book about marsupials during a visit to Sydney's Royal Easter Show.

'Sydney still sleeps very close to her mum, but she's starting to get more adventurous each day and it looks like she'll be an energetic little one as she grows up,' zoo keeper Brett Finlayson said. She's only the second Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat joey born at the zoo in three years to mum Korra and dad Noojee, with the endangered species notoriously difficult to breed. Keepers first noticed movement in Korra's pouch three months after mating. 'We didn't know for sure that we'd been successful until we saw a little foot pop out of the pouch,' Mr Finlayson said.

The zoo is currently trying to work out the best way to breed Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats in order to help their critically endangered cousin, the Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat. There is only 200 of the Northern species left in the wild and there is no zoo-based breeding program. The Southern Hairy-nosed Wombat gets its name from the hairs that cover its rhinarium – the area around the nostrils of the nose. The species can be found in arid grasslands in the southern coastal region of South Australia and the south eastern corner of Western Australia.

"By . Simon Walters . Accused: Stuart Hinton could be imprisoned by MPs until 2015 . A policeman accused of lying in the ‘Plebgate’ row involving former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell faces the extraordinary prospect of being forced to make a humiliating apology to the Commons. A powerful Commons committee is considering putting Detective Sergeant Stuart  Hinton ‘on trial’ after he was accused of falsely denying having called Home Secretary Theresa May ‘that woman’. MPs are deciding whether to summon Det Sgt Hinton to ‘the  bar of the Commons’ – a  punishment not used for more than half a century. If he refuses to apologise for allegedly misleading them,  MPs – in theory – have the power to jail him for the rest of this Parliament, not due to end until May 2015. However that is unlikely to happen. The row follows Det Sgt Hinton’s appearance with two fellow Police Federation officials at the Commons Home Affairs Committee last week to answer claims they gave a false account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October last year. The officers said Mr Mitchell  refused to give a full account of what he had said in Downing Street, when he was accused of calling police ‘f****** plebs’ after they stopped him cycling through the gates. He was forced to resign a week later. But a recording of the meeting made by Mr Mitchell, and published recently, revealed they had misrepresented him. According to the transcript, Det Sgt Hinton said the men had problems with ‘that woman the Conservative Party have’ – Mrs May. The alleged remark was made at a time when the Home Secretary was imposing budget cuts on forces. Conservative MP Michael Ellis, a member of the Home Affairs Committee, told Det Sgt Hinton the remark was ‘disgraceful’. The officer denied saying it and told MPs there must have been a ‘typing error’, adding: ‘I don’t recall using the term “this woman”.’ Grilling: The three police officers embroiled in the Plebgate scandal appear before the Home Affairs Committee . When the meeting finished, chairman Keith . Vaz told the officers: ‘We have found your evidence most . unsatisfactory.’ He reminded them that to give false witness to a . parliamentary committee is ‘a prima facie contempt of Parliament’. It is believed the committee has . written to Det Sgt Hinton to inform him the transcript indicates he . called Mrs May ‘that woman’ – and inviting him to admit he lied and to . apologise. If he refuses, the MPs may use their historic sanction  to . ‘admonish’ offenders for misleading Parliament by summoning them to the . ‘bar’ – directly facing the Speaker. He would then be invited to say . sorry. If he refuses, MPs can vote to reprimand him, or, in theory, . imprison him. The last . member of the public to be summoned to the bar was former Sunday Express . editor Sir John Junor in January 1957, after he published an article . criticising politicians’ petrol allowances. 'That woman': Stuart Hinton allegedly made a 'disgraceful' reference to Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured . He . was rebuked by MPs for failing to ‘establish the truth of the article’ and not being willing to ‘admit its obvious implications’. He apologised . and no further action was taken. Pressure . on Det Sgt Hinton also mounted last night after he received a public . rebuke from his boss, Warwickshire Chief Constable Andy Parker. In a letter to Mr Mitchell, Mr Parker lambasted Det Sgt Hinton for using the incident to ‘campaign against police cuts’. Det Sgt Hinton was unavailable for comment last night.","Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton could be punished on the orders of MPs .

"By . Martin Robinson . The police officer at the centre of the Plebgate controversy is suing Andrew Mitchell – and his superior has backed his version of events. Sergeant Ben Mills said he was told by PC Toby Rowland that Andrew Mitchell called him a ‘f****** pleb’ two minutes after his run-in with the then chief whip at Downing Street. Sgt Mills was PC Rowland’s immediate superior at the time. Legal row: PC Toby Rowland is to sue Andrew Mitchell, who last week called him a serial liar and demanded he repeat his claims the Tory MP called police 'plebs' in Downing Street . PC Rowland has announced he is suing Mr Mitchell for saying he lied. Mr Mitchell is already suing the officer for libel. The cases are likely to be heard together next year. Sgt . Mills – who is retired – told Sky News: ‘He told me he had given a man . who claimed to be the chief whip a section five public order warning. Obviously I was a little bit taken aback. ‘I . asked him how did that come about and he said the man had sworn at him . and called him a f****** pleb. He then said the man cycled away and said . he had not heard the last of it.’ Mr Mitchell was served with legal papers by lawyers on Tuesday night. Last . week the Crown Prosecution Service said PC Rowland will not face . criminal charges because there is not enough evidence he was lying. Mr . Mitchell then attacked the Met, and branded PC Rowland a serial liar. He demanded he repeat his story on oath – and PC Rowland accepted. Wrangle: Mr Mitchell at the gate where he clashed with the officer. He flatly denies claims that he used the word pleb after he was stopped cycling through the street's gates last September . Mr . Mitchell denies using the word pleb after he was stopped from cycling . in the main gate to Downing Street in September last year. PC . Rowland said Mr Mitchell said: ‘You should know your f****** place, you . don’t run this f****** Government, you’re f****** plebs.’ However, the MP insists he said: ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’. Highly . trained firearms officer PC Rowland was not arrested and is not facing . disciplinary action. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders . said in a statement last week ‘Mr Mitchell’s account has varied.’ One . police officer has been charged with lying about witnessing the scene, . but there is no evidence PC Rowland was involved in any way. Wounded: Former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell lost his over the cycling scandal . The Tory MP made the claims after the Crown Prosecution Service said . there was insufficient evidence to show that PC Rowland, 43, lied about . what had happened. Nor is he facing a misconduct inquiry. Mr Mitchell . said: ‘PC Toby Rowland, who was responsible for writing those toxic . phrases into his notebook, was not telling the truth. 'I . will seek to say this on oath in a court of law and it is our intention . to ensure that PC Toby Rowland has similarly to swear his account. ‘I understand that PC Toby Rowland has not been arrested or even interviewed under criminal caution during the police inquiry. 'I have told the truth about this incident. The police did not. My reputation was destroyed. I was vilified, relentlessly. 'What I do know is that I was stitched up; I was fitted up in Downing Street by armed police officers whose sole duty is to defend officials and to defend Downing Street.' 'We believe that the CCTV shows that the account of PC Toby Rowland is at very best inaccurate. 'I never said these phrases... no-one speaks like that these days. It's like a Hooray Henry, a lout from a 1920s B-movie being sort of characterised.' But Mr Rowland said he stood by his account of what was said. Mr Mitchell also claimed the police had failed to even interview PC Rowland as a . suspect about what happened. And he accused Metropolitan Police . Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe of prematurely clearing his officers . of wrongdoing. Prosecutors have decided a single . officer should face trial following a mammoth police investigation, . which involved taking more than 1,100 statements. PC Keith Wallis, 53, was charged with misconduct in a public office following allegations he falsely claimed he witnessed the row. Five . officers from the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group, including Wallis, . will now face gross misconduct hearings for discreditable conduct, . meaning they could lose their jobs. Three others will face less serious disciplinary proceedings.","Former Tory chief whip sued after calling PC Toby Rowland a 'serial liar'

Companion: Michael Jackson, pictured, had an Eastern European lady friend whom he'd hug and kiss in the back of his chauffeur-driven car, his former bodyguards have claimed in a tell-all book . Michael Jackson had an Eastern European lady friend whom he'd hug and kiss in the back of his chauffeur-driven car, his former bodyguards have claimed in a tell-all book. The bodyguards - Javon Beard and Bill Whitfield - write that the eccentric pop star sent them to pick up the mystery woman, referred to only as 'Friend,' as well as another woman, and he even sent them to buy presents for her from Tiffany. In an excerpt from the book, 'Remember the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days,' obtained by New York Daily News, the former staffers describe the King of Pop's slender 5-feet-4 gal pal as 'drop-dead gorgeous.' The men reveal how Jackson would allegedly visit her at night at a nearby Hampton Inn, after his kids went to bed. But 'Friend' was not his only fancy. The singer had another female visitor nicknamed 'Flower,' the bodyguards write. 'Flower' visited a few days after 'Friend' and while she and the pop star were close, Jackson was more fond of 'Friend,' Whitfield claims. He says it was a big deal when 'Friend' came to town and the bodyguards had to ensure everything was ready for her arrival. In the book, the men also claim Jackson was a strict father to his children and recall one instance when he disciplined Prince, now 17, when he failed to clean up after a dog he'd received as a gift. Musclemen: Bodyguard Bill Whitfield, left, is pictured on protection duty with Michael Jackson . Details: The details come in the book, 'Remember the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days,' to be published in June . Jackson moonwalked right into the dog's poop, the men claim, and then he 'chewed Prince out, big time,' ensuring his son followed the animal around with a dustpan and brush from then on. Beard and Whitfield also gained a glimpse of the King of Pop's money woes while acting as his muscle, they claim. The bodyguards write that they would sometimes go months without a paycheck from the world famous performer and witnessed Jackson splurge on a $10,000 shopping spree that ended when his credit card was declined. Despite dishing out such insider info, a source told the Daily News that the duo do not intend to embarrass Jackson in the book, and were in fact 'very fond of him and loved his kids.' 'Remember the Time' will be published in June.","The bodyguards - Javon Beard and Bill Whitfield - write that the eccentric pop star sent them to pick up the mystery woman, referred to only as 'Friend'

"By . Mia De Graaf . Trauma: Faye Smith (right) told how she broke down the bathroom door within seconds when her 12-year-old daughter Gabrielle did not respond to any knocks or calls . A mother has spoken out about the heart-wrenching moment she battered down the bathroom door to save her 12-year-old daughter from drowning in the bath, but she was too late. Faye Smith, 47, smashed the wooden door in seconds after Gabrielle failed to respond to her knocks and calls. But when she got to the tub, the little girl was motionless under the water. An inquest at Sheffield Coroner’s Court heard Gabrielle, known as Gabi to her friends, had suffered a violent seizure the previous year. She was diagnosed with non-epileptic attack disorder - which causes seizures, black-outs, collapsing and loss of bladder control. Despite Gabi’s condition, Mrs Smith was told her daughter could take a bath and cross roads without assistance. Mrs Smith, who also has a 16-year-old son, Zach, told the inquest Gabi's best friend Rebecca was at the house in Sheffield, Yorkshire, when the incident happened. She said: 'I was sitting with my son and having a cup of tea, then Rebecca knocked on my door and said: ""Faye, Gabi has been in the bathroom for ages"". 'Zach and I looked at each other.

"By . Tara Brady . Georgia Eden was kicked out of the Miss England competition after posting this picture online . A model has been kicked out of the Miss England competition because she posted a topless picture of herself online to promote a breast cancer campaign. Georgia Eden was told on Friday she could not take part in the Miss Oxfordshire heat of the competition after it was discovered she had posted a 'selfie' of herself to promote the fight against breast cancer. However, the 22-year-old professional model was told by organisers that the image contravened the rules because it brought the event into disrepute. Miss Eden challenged the ruling saying she tweeted the image twice in March with the hashtags #coppafeel and #breastcancerawareness after losing a close friend to the disease last year. Coppafeel is a campaign that promotes the for women to regularly check their breasts for signs of cancer. She said she had been asked to support the cause by her London modelling agency Mode, with who she has a strictly 'no-topless' contract. In the photograph she covers her breasts with one of her hands and her arm. Miss Eden said that she felt 'demeaned' by the ruling. 'I am quite upset by the accusation levelled against me because it is not true. 'I have been made to feel cheap. The photo is implied topless - but there are no nipples on show,' said Miss Eden, who lives in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. 'This is my career, I wouldn't have posted the photo if I thought there was anything wrong with it. I have never posted a topless image. I have never even gone topless on a beach.' However, organiser Beverley O'Neill, said she believed Miss Eden's pictures showed she was 'not suitable' for Miss Oxfordshire. On Wednesday, Ms O'Neill emailed Miss Eden, saying: 'It has been brought to the attention of Miss England that you have previously posted semi-naked photographs on social media. 'This contravenes rule 3, do not bring the Miss England contest or its sponsors into disrepute. 'As a result I regret to inform you that we will be unable to accept your further participation in the event.' Georgia Eden was told she would not be able to take part in the Miss Oxfordshire heat of the competition . Mrs O'Neill said today: 'This woman has got her boobies all over the place. 'She is all over social media with these pictures of herself... she wants to be a glamour model she is into all that stuff, Loaded and I don't even know what. It is worlds apart from our contest. Miss Eden said she tweeted the image twice after losing a close friend to the disease last year . 'She may have made a mistake but you can't be in a beauty pageant and a page three model, they are completely different worlds. 'The Miss England representative has to be someone of a certain calibre and she is not suitable.' Miss England area organiser Diane Slater said she believed there had been full frontal images but could not provide evidence of this. Miss Eden denied this completely. Ms Slater added that even Miss Eden's 'selfie' image was enough though to contravene competition rules. In the past weeks, Miss Eden and other contestants had their photos on the Miss Oxfordshire website and the public was invited to pay £1 pound each to vote for the girls. Miss Eden said she had 52 votes. Boyfriend Kieran Cochrane, aged 22 years, an Abingdon United footballer, said: 'One-hundred per cent, this doesn't make sense. She took this photo herself, to help a charity. 'She is a beautiful girl and was doing really well as a model, so when this happened she was really annoyed and upset.'","Georgia Eden told she could not take part in Miss Oxfordshire heat .

Despite his heart stopping for 78 . minutes, the footballer is expected to be discharged from the London . Chest Hospital within days after making a remarkable recovery.

"By . Rebecca Camber, Crime Reporter . Andrew Mitchell's daughter Hannah has spoken for the first time about the toll the 'Plebgate' allegations had taken on her father . The daughter of former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell told yesterday of her family’s despair at how he was ‘stitched up’ over the Plebgate affair. Hannah Mitchell spoke for the first time of the toll the allegations had taken on the Tory MP and why the unfolding saga has reinforced her belief in a free Press. The 25-year-old doctor also claimed Downing Street had betrayed Mr Mitchell by stopping him telling the whole truth when he was accused of calling police officers ‘plebs’. Dr Mitchell said that in the following weeks she, her mother Dr Sharon Bennett and sister Rosie had taken turns looking after the 57-year-old Sutton Coldfield MP, whom they feared to leave alone as he became ‘very withdrawn’. On the BBC Radio 4 programme Broadcasting House she recalled the moment the family learnt of an email from PC Keith Wallis allegedly purporting to be a member of the public who had witnessed the altercation on September 19 last year. In his email Mr Wallis, a member of Scotland Yard’s diplomatic protection unit, claimed he was sightseeing when he heard the Cabinet minister use the words ‘f****** plebs’ at officers. Dr Mitchell said: ‘I remember Dad shouted, “I’ve been stitched up.” ‘I just remember sitting in the chair shaking, being certain that something really terrible was going on, and we would say this to people but no one would believe us. We knew from the word go that it was a conspiracy.’ After the story broke, Dr Mitchell drove her father to face the media in London. He had hoped to present his side of the story, but Downing Street forced him to issue a ‘completely different’ statement. She said: ‘The press officers at No 10 were saying, “No, no you mustn’t, you don’t want to go into a firefight with police. Don’t deny it.” ‘So they kind of gave him this incredibly watered down statement which he then went out and gave and was absolutely shot down for.’ Dr Mitchell said that she, her mother Dr Sharon Bennett, left, and her sister Rosie had taken turns looking after the 57-year-old Sutton Coldfield MP, whom they feared to leave alone . Mr Mitchell was eventually forced to quit over the ‘toxic’ plebs phrase, which he hotly denies using. Dr Mitchell said of her father: ‘I have known him always as being a kind, warm, generous character. This caricature came out of an arrogant Tory toff, somebody who was rude and abusive to people. ‘It was a really very difficult time for my family. My father was in a very, very bad way. The character assassination that was going on would have hurt the most robust person.’ She had been left ‘shaken’ by having reporters on her doorstep but added: ‘I’m a great advocate of the free Press and this hasn’t changed my mind. I feel very, very happy that we’ve had the opportunity to try to put our side of the story across, and people now appear to be starting  to realise that my dad was not the sinner in the situation.’ Sergeant Chris Jones, Inspector Ken MacKaill and Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton have been accused of trying to discredit Mr Mitchell . Yesterday Sir Hugh Orde, the head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, called on three Police Federation representatives accused of giving misleading accounts about Mr Mitchell to apologise. They claimed that Mr Mitchell had refused to say what happened when they met to discuss the incident. Sir Hugh told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘The officers’ standards of conduct fell below that required.’ The Crown Prosecution Service is expected to announce soon whether anyone will face criminal charges over the affair. Eight people have been arrested, including five Met Police officers.","Hannah Mitchell tells of her family's despair over allegations .

"By . Daniel Martin . Disturbing: A new report has found that boys and girls as young as 13 are routinely swapping explicit photos of themselves a practice known as 'sexting' Boys and girls as young as 13 routinely swap explicit pictures of themselves, a disturbing investigation reveals today. Children are now so sexualised the practice has become ‘mundane and mainstream’. One girl told researchers: ‘I get asked for naked pictures at least two or three times a week.’ A boy said: ‘You would have seen a girl’s breasts before you’ve seen their face’ while another youngster referred to so-called sexting as ‘the new flirting’. Yesterday censors were forced to announce a crackdown on depraved films amid fears they distort the way teenage boys view women. The British Board of Film Classification will ban movies or cut scenes to protect the vulnerable. Pupils aged from 13 to 16 admitted to Channel 4 News that intimate photos helped them decide who to date. One told the programme her father would have asked girls for a kiss when he was her age ‘but now it’s kind of – do you want to have sex’. A boy of the same age said: ‘It might shock parents this is what kids get up to but it’s just everyday life. It’s natural – it’s all part of growing up.’ A 14-year-old from Berkshire said she received messages asking her to reply with a smiley face if she wanted sex or another phone symbol if she would prefer to perform a sex act on the sender. Insight into the pornography increasingly exchanged by young teenagers came from interviews carried out for the NSPCC and Channel 4’s Generation Sex series. ‘This is mainstream; this is normal; this is almost mundane for some of the people we spoke to,’ said Andy Phippen, the Plymouth University academic who carried out the study. ‘In pretty much every school in the country, people aged 13 and 14 are talking about this stuff and dealing with this stuff.’ Jon Brown, right, from the NSPCC charity warned that good quality sex education in schools is 'absolutely critical' following the study by Andy Phippen, left, of Plymouth University . Study: The report cited the case of one young girl who told researchers she gets asked for naked photos 'at least two or three times a week' (file picture) The research, based on focus groups with 220 Year Nine pupils aged 13 and 14, found they were becoming sexualised earlier, largely because pornography was so easy to find online. Professor Phippen, who is a social responsibility expert, also held sessions with 10- and 11-year-olds and found that most have received online abuse as well as messages from strangers. The Daily Mail is campaigning for an automatic block on online porn to protect children. Corrupting: Children are said to be so sexualised that the practice of 'sexting' has become 'mundane and mainstream' (file picture) Copycat: The study found that 'sexting' and exchanging graphic images draws influence from celebrity. Twilight star Ashley Greene, left, was left embarrassed when topless photos of her were leaked online as was actress Scarlett Johansson when her email account was hacked and topless pictures found their way onto the internet . Over-18s would be able to access adult material only after opting in with their service provider and going through a strict age verification process. Jon Brown of the NSPCC said: ‘What we’re seeing is that there is a very regular and normal consumption of hardcore adult pornography – that the sharing of explicit sexual imagery by photos or by video clips is now extremely normal. ‘It’s important to recognise what was previously regarded as unusual, concerning, or sensationalist, now has in fact become the norm.’ The focus groups found that the influence of porn was pervasive. A 15-year-old girl said that boys expected certain things of girls because they had become used to seeing it in online pornography. The boys told the study team that in the absence of decent sex education, they were turning to online porn to learn about sex and relationships. And the easy availability was having a debilitating effect on them. Explicit: Boys told the study that with a lack of sex education they are turning to online pornography to learn about sex and relationships (file picture) Restricted access: Despite Facebook having a minimum age of 13, the study found that most 10- and 11-year-olds are on social networking sites . Mac on sexting... 'Another one sexting, sarge. Chuck him in the back with the others' One 15-year-old said: ‘They’re put under pressure to get these photos of girls, to have muscles, to look this certain way, to be able to like do all these positions and to be able to last the longest in bed.’ The study found that sexting was related to other online issues and draws influence from celebrity and pornography. Porn is frequently viewed by boys of 13 and 14, and while the children acknowledge there is potential for harm, they do not feel they are affected themselves. Girls of this age generally do not look at porn, and view it as a negative influence on boys. Mr Brown added: ‘Good quality sex education is absolutely critical. It needs to start in primary school. It needs to be age-appropriate, if we are able to help them navigate their way through these pressures.’ Despite the fact that access to Facebook is supposed to be restricted to those aged 13 and above, the study found that most 10- and 11-year-olds are on social networking sites.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Crime boss: David Hunt (pictured leaving the High Court) has lost his libel claim against the Sunday Times after it described him as an 'underworld king' The Sunday Times has won a libel action brought by a man it described as an 'underworld king'. David Hunt claimed the May 2010 article meant he was the head of a crime organisation who had been shown to be concerned with murder, drug trafficking and fraud. Hunt's lawyers told London's High Court it was a libel of 'exceptional gravity' and Hunt himself gave evidence that the allegations were 'heartbreaking', had 'crucified' him and impacted badly on his business relationships. The judge found that the newspaper was correct in saying that Hunt had been violent and intimidating and that he was the head of an organisation involved in 'extreme violence and fraud'. But he did not hold that the Sunday Times had proved his crime ring was involved in murder and drug trafficking. Times Newspapers Ltd defended its story - . headlined 'Underworld kings cash in on taxpayer land fund' - on the . basis that it was substantially true and responsible reporting on a . matter of public interest. Hunt's . barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, who is chairman of the Hacked off . campaign, attempted to discredit the reporter who wrote the story. However, . after a 12-day hearing earlier this year, Mr Justice Simon dismissed . the case, saying that journalist Michael Gillard was highly experienced . and gave evidence that was both lucid and entirely credible. Mr . Gillard had been investigating Hunt and his associates for about 11 . years and during that time had obtained a significant amount of . information which led him honestly to believe that Hunt was a violent . and dangerous criminal at the head of a family-based network. The . judge said it was not a case in which a defendant 'embroidered the . allegations with epithets and gratuitous adjectives', nor was there any . evidence of embellishment of the facts. Victory: The Sunday Times has won a libel action at the High Court (above) brought by a man it described as an 'underworld king' Thrown out: Mr Justice Simon (pictured) dismissed attempts by Hunt's lawyers to discredit the reporter who wrote the story . He said: 'On the basis of the information Mr Gillard received from sources that he was entitled to treat as reliable and knowledgeable, as well as the information contained in documents, some of which I have referred to, I am satisfied that it was reasonable for him to describe the claimant as a violent and dangerous criminal and the head of an organised crime group implicated in murder, drug trafficking and fraud. 'I am also satisfied that he honestly believed that the allegations were accurate and true, and that it was his duty to write the article in the form that it was published.' He added that Mr Gillard behaved fairly and responsibly in gathering the information and in ensuring what was published was accurate and fair. It was 'a serious piece of investigative journalism'. The judge said the newspaper had justified its case that there were grounds to suspect Hunt was responsible for the intimidation of the main witnesses against him when he was prosecuted in 1999 for a violent assault, and that he attacked and threatened to kill a man at a court hearing and then avoided prosecution through intimidation. He added he had little difficulty in accepting it had justified that part of the meaning which related to Hunt being the head of an organised crime network, implicated in extreme violence and fraud. He did not, however, accept that involvement in murder and drug-trafficking were necessarily included within a general description of a head of an organised crime network. The judge said the newspaper had produced evidence from a number of police officers that Hunt was known as a major criminal, which was criticised by Hunt's lawyers on the basis that the officers were simply reciting what they had read in confidential police documents which were based on unsubstantiated reports and rumours. Hugh Tomlinson QC is renowend for keeping fighting privacy cases for this clients . David Hunt was represented in his libel case against the Sunday Times by renowned and controversial lawyer Hugh Tomlinson QC. Mr Tomlinson became known for keeping his clients - often celebrities and high-profile figures - anonymous by forging a career as a leading securer of privacy injunctions. 'Rules have been laid down,' the 59-year-old once told the Guardian. 'The fact the law is difficult to enforce doesn't mean you don't try to enforce it. 'The current legal position has got the balance essentially right. 'The main point of contention is that . the press say that if someone is having an adulterous affair, that's . something that should be exposed. 'The judges don't agree.' More recently, he has made a name for himself as the lawyer for the Hacked Off pressure group, which is demanding state-backed regulation of the press. In May, a senior Liberal Democrat MP used a Commons motion to launch an astonishing attack on Mr Tomlinson for 'acting against freedom of expression and the rule of law' during his legal career. John Hemming criticised him for his role in bringing legal injunctions on behalf of celebrities. In his early day motion, Mr Hemming criticised Mr Tomlinson – a barrister based at Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers – for taking out the super-injunction which banned any mention of an affair between Giggs and model Imogen Thomas. Mr Hemming also claimed that Mr Tomlinson helped to secure the 'secret imprisonment' of a woman simply for 'writing emails'. He accused him of playing a key role in Yvonne Goder being jailed after she sent emails to the Law Society complaining that a solicitors' firm had defrauded her mother using the Court of Protection. Mr Tomlinson's spokesman previously said the the motion contained 'a number of significant factual errors.' He added: 'Mr Tomlinson must take cases within his areas of expertise: he is not permitted to choose which cases to take based on his personal view. 'The arguments he advances are based on the instructions of his clients. 'Mr Hemming is entitled to criticise Mr Tomlinson's personal views, or the views of Hacked Off, but he is not entitled to attribute to Mr Tomlinson the views and arguments of his clients.'","David Hunt sued Sunday Times after it described him as 'underworld king'

"By . Philip Norman . As rock music’s greatest sex symbol over 50 years, Mick Jagger has always been notorious for his treatment of his wives and girlfriends, as distinct from those Rolling Stones groupies he bedded by the thousand. Though suicide attempts have been a constant motif in Jagger’s prodigious love life, until now his relationships seemed to have left few scars on him. His first serious girlfriend was Chrissie Shrimpton, the younger sister of Sixties supermodel Jean, whom he met when he was 19 and a student at the London School of Economics. Scroll down for video . Star-crossed: Chrissie Shrimpton and Mick Jagger in February 1966 on the way to New York (left). He dumped her for Marianne Faithfull (right) Happier days: Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull are pictured together in 1967 . At first, he was besotted and they planned to marry. But Jagger’s growing stardom — and notoriety — created an increasing gulf between them. In 1966, he brutally dumped her for convent-educated pop singer Marianne Faithfull. Alone in their London flat, the distraught Chrissie took an overdose of sleeping pills. Jagger found her just in time but, to avoid media publicity, his management had Chrissie taken to hospital in a plain van, checked in under a false name and then, in a private clinic, she was sedated and held a virtual prisoner until her parents reclaimed her. In those days, before palimony agreements, Jagger walked away without giving her a penny. Years later, when it was (mistakenly) reported she intended to sell some of his love letters, the ever-controlling Jagger threatened her with legal action unless she sent them back. Mick Jagger and Bianca Jagger pictured together on their wedding day in 1971 at the Town Hall in St Tropez, France. They divorced in 1979 . And so, Marianne Faithfull, the daughter of an Austrian baroness, became his muse, introducing the gauche young rocker to literature, ballet and opera. She also achieved infamy when Jagger and fellow Stone Keith Richards were busted for drug possession and briefly imprisoned in 1967. She was found by police seated next to Jagger wearing nothing but a fur rug. Not surprisingly, life with a super-vain superstar was no easier on Marianne. In 1969, while with Jagger in Australia, she swallowed 50 sleeping tablets, washing them down with hot chocolate. Mick Jagger married Texan supermodel Jerry Hall in 1990 and the couple had four children together before divorcing in 1999 . Jagger found her just in time, as he had Chrissie Shrimpton. But for Marianne, it was the start of a downward spiral into heavy drug use and alcoholism. After leaving Jagger, she was penniless, became a heroin addict and lived rough in Soho. Next up was the Nicaraguan-born Bianca Perez-Mora Macias, who became his first wife, though she later would say bitterly that her marriage ‘ended’ on her wedding day. Indeed, on the morning of their 1971 wedding in St Tropez in the South of France, before the world’s media, Jagger made a scene because Bianca refused to sign a pre-nuptial agreement. Thereafter, she felt herself to be little more than another member of his permanent court of gophers and sycophants, whom she nicknamed ‘the Nazi state’. The marriage was effectively over after a year, though the couple stayed together for the sake of their daughter, Jade. When Bianca finally divorced Jagger in 1979, smart work by his lawyers kept her settlement at only around £1 million. Bianca’s replacement, the Texan supermodel Jerry Hall — whom Jagger stole from fellow pop idol Bryan Ferry — at first seemed successful at bringing Jumping Jack Flash to heel. Not only did she have money of her own, meaning his precious fortune was safe, but she turned a blind eye to the affairs with much younger women that the priapic Jagger continued to have into middle age. Jerry was desperate to marry, even packing a wedding dress in hope every time she went on a Stones tour. Jerry Hall had four children with Jagger - and managed to walk away from their marriage with a $7.4million settlement . But it was not until she’d borne him two children that he relented and agreed to marry her in a Balinese woodcarver’s hut in 1990. Yet the old devil’s infidelities still continued, including a rumoured affair with the future French First Lady, Carla Bruni. The breaking point with Jerry was his affair with the Brazilian model Luciana Morad, which resulted in a son, Lucas. When Jerry sued for divorce, having by then had four children by Jagger, he crassly claimed their Balinese wedding was legally invalid, and so the marriage was annulled ‘by mutual agreement’. Jagger is reported to be 'devastated' at losing L'Wren Scott. They were together for 13 years . Jerry Hall’s rumoured settlement of £4.5 million made her the first Jagger ex to describe him as ‘very, very generous’. With L’Wren Scott, he was thought to have found someone with whom to grow old comfortably. She was wealthy, independent and didn’t demand commitment. Yet even after all their years together, Jagger, the perpetual adolescent, still referred to her only as ‘someone I’m sort of seeing’. Now, though, he is reported to be ‘devastated’ at losing her. That emotion will be one that the serial heart-breaker has never experienced before.","Rock icon has endured turbulent love life over the decades .

"By . James Salmon . 'Casino banker': John Hourican, head of the Royal Bank of Scotland, will step down over the Libor rate-rigging scandal . The top ‘casino banker’ at Royal Bank of Scotland is to step down over the Libor  rate-rigging scandal – and will be forced to return up to £7million in bonuses. John Hourican, head of the bank’s investment arm, will quit at the end of the month in an attempt to satisfy demand from politicians and regulators for a senior scalp. Mr Hourican, the state-backed lender’s most highly paid employee, will have to give up £4million in share options he was due to receive from previous years. Sources at the bank indicated that it would dock up to £7million in total, as Mr Hourican will also forfeit his bonus for last year. The figure has not yet been disclosed, but he received a £2.5million payout in 2011. He will still receive a pay-off worth £700,000, however, as he retains his contractual entitlement to a year’s salary. The news emerged as RBS braces itself to receive a fine of around £400million later today for rigging Libor interest rates. That dwarfs the £290million fine issued to Barclays last summer. Damning emails are expected to show that RBS traders bragged about rigging the Libor rate, which is used to set mortgage repayments for millions of customers and is linked to trillions of pounds of investments around the world. Although there is no evidence that Mr Hourican knew about the scandal, traders are understood to have brazenly rigged rates on his watch.

But he is already a controversial figure at the bank, having presided over thousands of jobs cuts as he wound down the investment arm. Last year Mr Hourican cashed in £4.8million in share bonuses awarded to him in 2009, just months after RBS received a £45billion bailout from taxpayers. And in March 2010 he received a package worth £7.7million, including deferred share awards paid out in later years. In an attempt to appease public anger, George Osborne this week promised that RBS bankers – not taxpayers – would pay the Libor fine out of their bonuses.","Mr Hourican will quit to satisfy demand from politicians and regulators .

"By . Kate Lyons . A Brisbane internet tycoon who turned informant for the FBI and was instrumental in shutting down America's online poker industry is set to avoid more jail time. Daniel Tzvetkoff, 30, was arrested in Las Vegas in 2010 for illegally processing more than $US1 billion for online poker companies through his company Intabill. The business whiz, who had been making $3 million a week, faced a 76-year jail term for the crimes and served four months in jail before turning informant for the FBI and providing information that helped to shut down some of the biggest online poker companies in the U.S. including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker. Daniel Tvetkoff, 30, from Brisbane was facing a jail term of up to 76 years for processing more than $1 billion for online poker companies in the U.S. Tzvetkoff was released from prison after informing on the poker companies and returned to Australia where he is living with his wife Nicole and two children – a four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter. Now it seems as though his time as a grass for the FBI will keep him from serving any more jail time, with a probation report recommending that he receive a sentence of between six and 12 months imprisonment. His lawyer, Robert Goldstein, is arguing that the four months his client has already served in jail is sufficient. 'For a first-time offender who has never before experienced prison, four-plus months inside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn constitutes a harsh and significant punishment,' Mr Goldstein wrote in his sentencing submission, reported the Courier Mail. Tzvetkoff pictured with his now-wife Nicole (left) at a costume in Las Vegas . Daniel, right, poses with his business partner, attorney Sam Sciacca, in 2008 on the day he was named in Business Weekly Review's Young Rich List. His online payment processing system saw his personal wealth soar to an estimated $80 million . 'The reality is that even one day in those type of conditions can be exceedingly harsh punishment for a first-time offender like Mr Tzvetkoff.' Tzvetkoff struck a lucrative, though legally dubious, deal with online poker companies after the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act was passed in the U.S. in 2005. The act made it illegal to move money online for bets on any 'sporting event or contest or game of chance'. Tzvetkoff and his business partner Sam Sciacca provided brokerage services to online poker companies and Tzvetkoff was soon earning a reported $3 million a week. He was arrested in 2010 for his part in the racket. At the time of his arrest Tzvetkoff also had a reported personal debt of $143 million, which meant he was being sought by mob figures as well as police. After four months in jail, Tzvetkoff handed over 90,000 documents from Intabill to prosecutors, which helped shut down some of the biggest online poker companies in the U.S. including PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker.

"By . Emily Crane . A reigning beauty queen has given up her Miss Teenager Universe crown after claiming she was 'bullied' by organisers to find the next Australian contestant and pay for them to enter the competition. Jasmine Stringer who won the title in Panama last July blamed international organisers for her resignation on Tuesday after financial discussions about awarding the crown to the next winner turned sour. The Gold Coast beauty queen, 17, said she was told to find and pay for the next Australian contestant to enter this year's competition in Guatemala and pay her own way there to return the crown. Scroll down for video . Beauty queen: Jasmine Stringer from the Gold Coast has handed back her crown after winning the Miss Teenager Universe crown in Panama last July . Her winning contract included a return trip to the 2014 contest later this year, but Ms Stringer was told she would have to forgo her title if she could not pay the money. The financial discussions came about after Miss Teenager Australia organisers, Mark Williams and Thelma Rodriguez, moved to the US and decided not to hold the competition this year. 'If you cannot follow he (sic) crown you must give the title to first runner up and in this way we will make a formal statement to publicise the news,' an email from international coordinator Walter Guillen read, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin. 'If you want to follow with the title of Miss Teenager 2013 and come to Guatemala to deliver your crown and receive the second part of the award, you must pay $2,000USD to the organisation Miss Teenager Pageant.' The 17-year-old beauty queen claims she was financially 'bullied' by international organisers to pay for the next Australian contestant after local organisers decided not to hold a competition this year . Ms Stringer said she entered the competition to take a stand against cyber bullying but now claims she has become a victim . The teen, pictured here at the Nickelodeon Slimefest in 2013, said she represented Miss Teenager Universe at an 'exceptional level' Ms Stringer said she only received $2,000 of her $4,000 winnings and the rest will be paid when she returns the crown. She entered the competition to campaign against cyber bullying but Ms Stringer said she was forced to resign to avoid being involved with an organisation that 'bullies their teenage queens'. 'For the past three months I have been bullied by the Miss Teenager Universe organisation run by Toni Berganza in Guatemala who has sent me threats and ultimatums involving finances which as a 17-year-old I do not have,' she said. 'I have represented as Miss Teenager Universe at an exceptional level expected of a beauty queen but unfortunately the organisation has not shown me any respect in return.' The model said she only received $2,000 of her $4,000 winnings and the rest will be paid when she returns the crown . Her financial troubles came about after Miss Teenager Australia organisers, Mark Williams and Thelma Rodriguez, moved to the US and decided not to hold the competition this year . The former directors of the Australian competition said they supported Ms Stringer's decision. 'We at Miss Teenager Australia completely support Jasmine Stringer's decision to resign as Miss Teenager Universe 2013. We have found the Organisation of Toni Berganza and their management of Jasmine throughout her year as their Queen to be very unprofessional with constant bullying,' they said. 'Jasmine is an extremely professional person and a great role model for any business and she has been a great ambassador to Australia.'

"By . Andrew Levy . The family of a young mother who fled to Spain to stop social services taking her baby demanded an apology yesterday after health workers confirmed the girl was thriving under her care. Megan Coote, who has mild learning difficulties, was told she would have to hand over her child because of concerns over its emotional development. Instead, she moved to Alicante where she gave birth to her daughter, Olivia. Relief: Megan Coote, 24, from Suffolk has won the right to keep her daughter Olivia after a two-year battle with Suffolk County Council . Happy little girl: Miss Coote gave birth to Olivia, now two, abroad after she and her mother fled to Spain for fear social workers would take the child . She returned only after her parents were granted a court order allowing them to share her parental responsibilities – meaning she was certain she could keep  her baby. Now Miss Coote, 24, wants to highlight what she says are the dangers posed by social workers who wield the power to tear families apart. ‘I have proven the social workers wrong,’ she said. ‘They made the wrong decision.’ Her father Dale, a 47-year-old businessman, said: ‘We have just had Olivia’s two-year check and a health worker said she was well advanced and interacting with everyone perfectly. They were absolutely over the moon with her. ‘That made me think that social services had made a mistake and hadn’t apologised. Unsettling start: Miss Coote pictured with her days old daughter and parents Dave and Lorraine in Alicante, Spain in April 2010 . ‘They haven’t apologised to my wife, who lost three stone when she went to Spain with Megan, or to my daughter for what they put her through. ‘They made her feel like dirt and she was talking about taking her own life if they took her daughter away.’ Miss Coote, who was diagnosed with learning difficulties as a child, became pregnant in 2009. Suffolk social services carried out an assessment which flagged up concerns about her low IQ and inability to show emotion, which it said meant she could not look after  a baby. Child protection officers also claimed Olivia’s father – from whom Miss Coote had separated – had a bad record with social services, but refused to give further details. Miss Coote’s father and mother Lorraine, 45, offered themselves as potential foster parents but realised staff did not favour their application after a report criticised the fact Mr Coote had smacked his three children to discipline them. Proud grandparents: In January 2011 Lorraine and Dave Coote were granted a residence order meaning they could share parental responsibilities of Olivia with their daughter . Happy family: Miss Coote said she would tell other mothers in her situation that they have to believe in themselves and know they are a good mother . In February 2010, Miss Coote and her mother drove to Spain, where she gave birth a week later. The family spent £12,000 on accommodation and other costs until they were assured mother and child would not be separated. Backing: Birmingham Yardley MP and chairman of Justice for Families, John Hemming, claimed social workers are removing children from families for 'spurious reasons' A five-minute court hearing in January last year confirmed a ‘residence order’, meaning Miss Coote would live with her parents in Kesgrave, near Ipswich, and Olivia could be taken off the at-risk register. Mr Coote, who owns three companies involved with the construction, container and motor industries, said: ‘When Megan came back from Spain an independent team of social workers were assigned to her. ‘They eventually apologised for interfering in our lives and said there was never any need for them to be involved. ‘I have phoned the council nine times to discuss the case and get an apology but they will not have a meeting with me.’ His daughter added: ‘I would tell other mothers in the same situation to keep fighting. You have to believe in yourself and know that you are a good mother.’ Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming, the chairman of campaign group Justice for Families, accused social workers of removing children from families for ‘spurious reasons’ and said experts used in family courts were ‘unreliable’. He added: ‘They remove babies from people who are never given the chance to prove they are good parents – and even when there are good grandparents around. The Government should stop being complacent and take action.’ Suffolk county council said it  was ‘delighted that everything  has continued to go well’ for  the family. A spokesman said: ‘When concerns about the wellbeing of a child are brought to the attention of children’s services, we have a duty to investigate. ‘Over the past two years, childcare professionals have had a very positive working relationship with the family.’ Asked about apologising for the Cootes’ treatment, they added: ‘We are more than happy to speak with the family when they feel the need to contact us.’","Suffolk Country Council deemed Megan Coote, 24, who suffers learning difficulties unfit before baby was even born .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A 27-year-old delusional former soldier with PTSD was in police custody Tuesday afternoon after shooting himself during a police standoff in Knoxville, Tennessee. Authorities say David Eugene Smith called area police to tell them that he was the man on the news accused of killing three people in Lakeland, Florida--including his own sister--and fleeing. According to Knox County Chief Deputy Sheriff Eddie Biggs, Smith said he wanted to die at the hands of law enforcement. Standoff: Knox County SWAT members engage in a standoff with triple homicide suspect David Eugene Smith at a Days Inn Tuesday in Knoxville . Called police himself: Authorities say Smith called area police to turn himself in after news of his alleged triple murder and subsequent flight from the Lakeland, Florida scene of the crime broke. A sheriff's deputy said he wanted to die at the hands of police . Self-inflicted: Police say the 27-year-old 'delusional' former soldier shot himself during the standoff before he was dragged away in unknown condition . 'We hope and pray that we don't have a rampage': Police hunting for David Eugene Smith (in earlier police photo) feared he was a big risk to whatever community he ended up fleeing to . SWAT members surrounded the Knox County motel where Smith was staying on Tuesday. At some point Smith fired shots, including one at himself. He was wounded and taken into custody, though the extent of his injuries were unknown. Biggs says the SWAT officers did not fire. According to WFTS, the suspect was living in the Lakeland crime scene where the bodies of Danyala 'Diamond' Smith, 31, Ni'kosi Williams, 25, and Miranda Mims, 28 were discovered Monday evening by one of the victims' 14-year-old daughter. On Facebook, Diamond Smith listed her spouse as fellow victim Miranda Mims. A frantic manhunt had been underway for  Smith as police feared the armed and mentally ill man could strike again in the worst way. 'We hope and pray that we don't have a rampage,' said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. Police were . first tipped off to the grisly scene left behind at the Florida . residence by the 14-year-old daughter of one of the victims. The girl returned home Monday night after having been away for the weekend at an ROTC event. Victims: Police say Smith's sister Danyala (right) was among the victims.

Tragic: Ni'kosi Williams (right) was also shot and killed in the Lakeland home and his father told authorities he was friends with Danyala Smith and Miranda Mims (left) She then found her mother dead and her commander reported the shocking crime to authorities, police say. Police say Smith is delusional and has a previous record for drug and weapon offenses as well as a mental hygiene arrest. He reportedly posted to Facebook the message 'my adulterous wife, you know better' despite not actually being married. 'We fear for the community': Smith has a history of PTSD and mental illness and police called him 'exceptionally dangerous' but say he was 'compliant' while being hauled away. He'd been living with two of the victims for months prior to the slaying . 'We've got to locate this fellow because he is absolutely dangerous,' said Sheriff Judd at a news conference. Smith was believed to be driving a beige 2002 Mercury Sable with Florida tags 708MDB. He is described as being of Native American descent and has black hair and dark eyes. Police originally believed he may have been headed toward family in Texas or to Chattanooga, Tennessee where he knows a former classmate.","Police say David Eugene Smith gunned down three people in a Lakeland, Florida home including his sister .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Adam Laxalt entered the national political scene in February 2013 when his mother shockingly revealed that he was the product of an affair she had with a U.S. Senator - a secret she had kept for nearly 35 years. Just one year later, he is shaking up Nevada politics - casting aside his label as a 'love child' and capitalizing on his famous name and even more famous political connections. He may be the illegitimate son of former New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici, but he's also the grandson of Paul Laxalt - a former U.S. Senator for Nevada and a man who was so close to President Ronald Reagan he was called the 'First Friend.' Friends in high places: Adam Laxalt (right) is getting support from GOP bigwigs like former UN Ambassador (center). He is pictures here with mother Michelle (right) Laxalt has risen from obscurity to become a contender for the Nevada Attorney General job - despite having no experience in public office . Laxalt's grandfather, Paul Laxalt, was so close to Ronald Reagan that he was called 'the First Friend' The 34-year-old U.S. Navy veteran, who served in Iraq, is running for Nevada Attorney General against a heavily-favored opponent - who is himself part of a political dynasty. And despite the fact that Laxalt has no experience in public office, he's already getting the support of Republican big guns like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and Reagan's close adviser and former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, Politico Magazine reports. Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld gave him a personal check for $5,000. And Dick Cheney called Laxalt 'courageous,' adding that it should be 'the highest priority' to get him elected. One prominent Republican told Politico Magazine that Laxalt - a previous unknown in state politics - had built his candidacy almost entirely on the strength of his grandfather's name. 'If his name were Adam Smith, this race would be a total joke,' the source said. New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici, pictures with longtime wife Nancy, kept his affair secret - even from his family - for nearly 35 years . Laxalt, a Republican, is a former U.S. Navy officer who served in Iraq . Not everyone in Laxalt's family agrees with his choice to call on his grandfather's political allies - believing he is running on his family name and nothing else . Not everyone in Laxalt's family appreciates him leveraging his grandfather's connections. Five members of his own family have contributed to Democratic opponent Ross Miller - the current Nevada Secretary of State who is the son of former governor Bob Miller. 'Ross is running on his own record; Adam is running on my father’s name,' Neena Laxalt, one of Adam Laxalt's aunts, told Politico Magazine. Laxalt's mother Michelle, a prominent Washington lobbyist, shocked political circles in February 2013 when she revealed that she had had an affair with Senator Domenici. She was a 24-year-old presidential aide. He was a 50-year-old married politician. They agreed to keep it a secret and for more than 30 years -- well after he left office nobody knew - not even Demenici's wife Nancy or their eight children. Michelle came finally forward, she said, because she feared a story was about to emerge about the affair. However, Politico Magazine reports that some political observers wonder whether she was paving the way for her son to enter public life.","Adam Laxalt, 35, was born after his mother - a 24-year-old White House staffer - had an affair with married Senator Pete Domenici .

They dance to The Emotions’ 1977 hit Best Of My Love and a clip of the performance – called A Flash Mob For Amy! - has become an internet sensation, with over half a million views registered on video sharing site Vimeo.

Movers and shakers: Amy (inset) registers her delight as 50 of her friends and family form a flash mob, dancing to Best Of My Love . Three-sy does it: The clip, which has gone viral, starts with just a handful of Amy's closest relatives dancing in front of her . Numbers swell: Within seconds the group has grown, with people running on to the lawn from hiding spots at the side of the house . . The video begins with a touching message from 56-year-old Amy’s family, who explain that she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in October 2012. The news ‘rocked the family’, but the situation looked brighter after several months of chemotherapy and surgery, the message says. Sadly, in October 2013, doctors revealed that the cancer had returned and was inoperable. But Amy’s family and friends remained determined to make the most of the time they had left. The message on the video continues: ‘Being present in the moment is of the utmost importance; as Amy says, “dum vivimus vivamus… while we live, let us live.”’ The flash mob clearly invokes this positive spirit. Happy day: At the end of the performance the troupe rushes forwards to hug Amy . The idea of a flash mob was dreamt up by Amy's daughter, social worker Lauren Keppel, who thought that it would emphasize to her mom just how significant she was, as the family have a great love of music. Keppel choreographed the routine with her best friend, Christina Noellsch, who later uploaded the video to Vimeo. The clip begins with Amy being led out to a chair in the backyard of her home in Wheaton, near Chicago, by Ms Keppel, her husband and Amy's husband, Scott Hindsley. Then the track begins and the three present begin dancing on the lawn in time with the music. But three very quickly becomes 50, with friends and family running from hiding spots at the side of the house. Amy’s reaction is one of joyous amazement as the troupe perform their routine. At the end they all rush forward to give Amy a hug. Amy told Today: 'It is the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. I just love them all so much. I am really, really blessed.' Ms Keppel told MailOnline: 'The original intent of this flash mob was simply to remind my mom of how surrounded by love she is. We recorded it so that she could re-watch it in times of struggle, and so that the 50 of us who participated could watch her beautiful reactions once she's no longer with us. 'The fact that the video has traveled the globe has been incredible and overwhelming. We are so grateful to be able to share the essence of my mom's love with the world.' For Ms Noellsch the highlight was seeing just how happy it made Amy. She said: 'Just being there to see Amy's reaction in the moment was amazing and beautiful. The fact that the world is getting to see it is even better!' The video, filmed on May 10, a day before Amy's 56th birthday, has received dozens of comments from touched Vimeo users. Tabitha Escobedo wrote: 'Oh happy day, oh happy day, what a great way and purpose for getting together friends!' Janet 1, meanwhile, said: 'OK, I joined Vimeo just so that I can leave this comment because I am so moved by this video. What a beautiful smile on Amy. Her laughter and expressions are priceless.

"By . Jonathan Petre . The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby was last night facing mounting pressure to crack down on clergy who marry their gay partners – as the threat of a split in the Anglican Church grew. A powerful group of conservative African Archbishops said they were ‘deeply troubled’ by liberal Western attitudes towards homosexuality and that Church of England clerics were flouting a ban on same-sex weddings. The Archbishops said it was ‘very concerning’ that the ban was being ‘openly disregarded’ and added: ‘We look to the Church of England to give clear leadership as moral confusion about the status of marriage [in England] deepens.’ Pressure: Archbishop Justin Welby was last night facing pressure to crack down on clergy who marry their gay partners after African bishops spoke out against clergymen flouting a ban on same-sex marriage . Their intervention follows the civil wedding this month of Canon Jeremy Pemberton, a hospital chaplain, and his partner Laurence Cunnington under new laws pushed through by David Cameron. Mr Pemberton, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, is facing disciplinary action from the Bishop of Lincoln Christopher Lowson for disobeying the House of Bishops’ ruling that gay clergy should not marry because marriage should only be between a man and a women. But Church of England conservatives believe the bishop will drag his feet because of fears of a liberal backlash – opening the floodgates to more gay clergy weddings.

Debbie Duran says she carries a knife on her at all times and that it came in handy on Wednesday when two lose Pit Bulls attacked her friend and one of her three German Sheperds . Debbie Duran used her filet knife to fatally stab the two Pit Bulls that got loose . Duran, who carries the knife for protection stabbed the dogs to death to the dismay of the Pit Bulls' owner Kathy Suggs. 'She's just here stabbing like a wild, mad lady,' Suggs told NBC. 'I can't even reach in 'o get the dog because she's swinging the knife.' Suggs told reporters that she didn't think that Duran was justified in killing both Angel and JoJo. Suggs said that even though both her Pit Bulls got loose through an open garage, that no one should have stabbed her dogs to deatyh. 'This lady was walking around, I think, with the intent to kill the dog,' Suggs said. 'Who walks around with a butcher knife? We all walk our dogs around here.' Debbie Duran's Dogs suffered from bite wounds but Suggs lost both her Pit Bulls and faces a $200 fine for allowing her dogs to get loose. Sheriffs and animal control officers allowed Duran to keep her filet knife because she acted out of self-defense. Kathy Suggs, the owner of the Pit Bulls, claims that Duran had no right to kill her two dogs and acted like a 'mad woman' Suggs' Pit Bulls escaped through her open garage and now Suggs must pay a $200 fine .","Debbie Duran claims two Pit Bulls attacked her friend and one of her three German Sheperds .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A family escaped their burning farmhouse after the building caught fire because rats chewed through their electric cables. Four adults and children managed to get out of the historic property in Cheriton, Hampshire, on Sunday evening. Firefighters today revealed that rodents were the reason the fire broke out in the roof of the building. Investigators found that rats had gnawed away the plastic insulation from the cables. Blaze: The fire, which broke out in Cheriton, Hampshire, on Sunday was caused by rats . Gnawing: Hampshire Fire and Rescue said that rats in the loft had chewed through the plastic coating on electrical cables . A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue confirmed that nobody was injured in the incident. He said: 'They found the origin of the fire was most likely to have been electrical cabling in the roof, which had seen its PVC insulation chewed off by rodents. 'The owner of the farmhouse was in his property at the time the fire broke out and managed to evacuate, along with several members of his family. Damage: Nobody was injured, but the roof of the historic property was badly damaged . Burning: Investigators reached their conclusion after scouring the property yesterday . 'They were then able to call 999 to raise the alarm. No-one was hurt in the incident'. Station manager Mark Budden said: 'The firefighters worked extremely hard to stop the fire spreading to the rest of the roof and also salvaged much of the owner's property from the house. 'The first crew on the scene put in place a really good plan, which ultimately saved much of the roof and top floor of the building'.","Historic home in Cheriton, Hampshire, caught fire on Sunday evening .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Harvard researchers have succeeded in creating quantum switches that can be turned on and off using a single photon. This technological achievement could pave the way for creating highly secure quantum networks. Built from single atoms, the first-of-their-kind switches could one day be networked via fiber-optic cables to form the backbone of a 'quantum Internet' that allows for perfectly secure communications. Quantum switches that can be turned on and off using a single photon have been created by researchers at Harvard, paving the way towards a 'quantum Internet' Professor of Physics Mikhail Lukin, together with Professor Vladan Vuletic of MIT, led a team consisting of graduate students Jeff Thompson and Lee Liu and postdoctoral fellows Tobias Tiecke and Nathalie de Leon to construct the new system. 'From a technical standpoint, it’s a remarkable accomplishment,' Lukin said of the research. 'Conceptually, the idea is very simple: Push the conventional light switch to its ultimate limit. 'What we’ve done here is to use a single atom as a switch that, depending on its state, can open or close the flow of photons - and it can be turned on and off using a single photon.' Though the switches could be used to build a quantum computer, Lukin said it’s unlikely the technology will show up in the average desktop computer. Where it will be used, he said, is in creating fiber-optical networks that use quantum cryptography, a method for encrypting communications using the laws of quantum mechanics to allow for perfectly secure information exchanges. 'Quantum' is defined as the minimum amount of a physical . entity. A photon is a quantum, for example, as it is the smallest . divisible unit of light: a single light particle. Quantum mechanics, also known as quantum physics, describes . the behaviour of small particles, including photons, as well as atoms, ions and . electrons. The behaviour of these particles can seem counter-intuitive . and often goes against the rules of classical physical systems. One of the fundamental principles of quantum systems is that . they can behave like both particles and waves. Light is commonly referred to . as, and treated like, a wave, but it consists of particles: photons. This type of behaviour, known as wave-particle duality, . gives rise to the strange properties that make the prospect of future quantum . technologies exciting in areas such as communication, timing, navigation and . information security and storage. In theory, quantum . computing could allow for huge amounts of data to be processed, which is even . beyond today's supercomputers, as well as entirely new types of computation. Such systems make it impossible to intercept and read messages sent over a network, because the very act of measuring a quantum object changes it, leaving behind telltale signs of the spying. 'It’s unlikely everyone would need this type of technology,' he said. 'But there are some realistic applications that could someday have transformative impact on our society. 'At present, we are limited to using quantum cryptography over relatively short distances - tens of kilometers. 'Based on the new advance, we may eventually be able to extend the range of quantum cryptography to thousands of kilometers.' Importantly, . their system is highly scalable, and could one day allow for the . fabrication of thousands of such switches in a single device. 'What . we’ve really done is take ideas that people have been exploring, and . still are exploring, in macroscopic systems where the light bounces back . and forth on two centimeter-size mirrors to interact with an atom. We’ve taken that and shrunk it down,' said Thompson. 'For . two decades, researchers have been working on coupling two or three of . these macroscopic systems and [creating] a simple network. 'But it’s very easy for us to create three or four, or 10,000 of these optical circuits. 'What the present paper shows is, at least technologically, the way forward.' The researchers say that their system is highly scalable, which could one day allow for the fabrication of thousands of such 'quantum switches' into a single device like a computer to make it more secure . Though . fabricated in a way similar to how traditional computer chips are made, . the integrated circuits built by Thompson and Tiecke don’t run on . electricity, but on light. The . chips use nanophotonic technology - essentially the ability to create . 'wiring' that can channel and control the pathway of light - to build . optical circuits that can then be connected to fiber optic cables. After . placing the optical circuits in a vacuum chamber, researchers used . 'optical tweezers' - precisely focused lasers - to capture a single atom . and cool it to a fraction above absolute zero. They then move the atom to within a few hundred nanometers of the chip. Simply bringing the two parts together, however, isn’t enough. To . create quantum switches that one day may be at the heart of quantum . networks, the researchers bombard the atom with microwaves and lasers, . causing it to enter a quantum superposition state, meaning it can occupy . multiple quantum states, corresponding to on and off states of the . switch, at once. 'For this to work, the atom switch must be prepared in this special superposition state,' Lukin explained. 'This . superposition state is extremely fragile - so fragile that when a . single photon hits it, it actually changes its phase. That change of . phase is what allows it to act like a valve, and be turned on or off.' That is one way Lukin believes, for quantum systems to make the same transition that conventional computers made decades ago. 'Conventional computers were initially built using vacuum tubes, and people eventually developed integrated circuits used in modern computers,' he said. 'Where quantum systems stand today, the best systems are still analogous to vacuum tubes. 'They typically use vacuum chambers to isolate and hold single atoms using electromagnetic fields. 'But it’s very clear, if we want to scale these systems up, we have to think about using integrated circuits,' he continued. 'What Jeff and Tobias have done is create a hybrid system. 'We take atoms in vacuum chambers and combine them with integrated circuits.' While it’s unlikely the switches will become standard equipment for personal computers, Lukin said, they could appear in prototype quantum networks in as little as a decade. 'There are other systems that are more sophisticated in terms of building a quantum computer,' Thompson said. 'But the key advantage to what’s demonstrated in this paper is the single-atom switch is very tightly coupled to light, and specifically to light in optical fibers.'","Researchers at Harvard University have made 'quantum switches'

"By . Julian Robinson . Amelia Williams, of Toxteth, Liverpool, has been jailed for more than four years for mauling a stranger in the street in the Kensington area of the city during a zombie-like 'biting' attack just so she could go to prison and 'get an education' A mother-of-two mauled a stranger in the street punching her 30 times and biting her hand in a zombie-like 'biting' attack so she could get an education in jail, a court heard. Former hairdresser Amelia Williams, 33, of Toxteth, Liverpool, had wanted to get better qualifications but she did not want her 'hard working family' or the state to pay for her to go on a course. Instead she randomly ambushed Sharon Bentley, 54, punched her 30 times in the face, then sank her teeth into the victim’s hand as she screamed for help - not realising taxpayers would be funding a jail education anyway. Her counsel Paul Lewis said his client carried out the attack, in Kensington, Liverpool, because she did not want the state to fund a college course. But . he added: 'She has failed to register that the state would pay for her . time in jail anyway. The motive for this attack is peculiar.' Administration worker Mrs Bentley who had been waiting for a bus put up a fight as Williams also tried to snatch her handbag. The . terrified victim clung onto the bag and the struggle became so violent . it spilled out into the middle of the road and into the path of traffic. The attack ended when a passing taxi driver stopped to help the victim and followed Williams until she was arrested nearby. Williams . - who has a record for violence - claimed she carried out the attack . 'as an attempt at education' she hoped to get behind bars. Sharon Bentley's injuries to her hand following the attack in Kensington, Liverpool, where Williams sank her teeth into her skin . Sharon Bentley says she has barely left her own home since the attack and is now 'frightened to go out'. She was punched 30 times in the face during the attack in the Kensington district of Liverpool . But as she began four and a half years in jail, Mrs Bentley, who is now scarred for life issued a statement telling of her ordeal. She said: 'There is no easy fix to this and it is just a waiting game. 'Since the attack, I have barely moved out of my home. I am frightened to go out. I am due to return to work at the end of the month which I have to do. I don’t know how I am going to commute to and from work. 'I have always used public transport and I can’t afford to get taxis. I tend to wake up throughout the night every hour or so. 'I have relived this attack from start to finish and find myself in an emotional mess on quite a few occasions.' Sharon Bentley was punched 30 times in the face before Williams, of Toxteth, Liverpool, sank her teeth into the 54-year-old's hand as she screamed for help . Earlier . Liverpool Crown Court was told the attack occurred when Mrs Bentley was . waiting at the bus stop in Kensington district of the city at 5.30am on . April 3 this year. Mr Rob Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Mrs Bentley describes the female shouting at her and punching her all over her face and body. 'She said she was punched maybe 30 times. She was terrified. She began to shout for attention and the struggle continued. It is quite clear that the two females found themselves in the middle of the main carriageway.' Taxi driver John McGuire stopped his car to intervene when Williams grabbed her victim’s arm and bit into her hand, causing it to bleed heavily. A street scene from the Kensington area of Liverpool Sharon Bentley was set upon by Amelia Williams. The victim put up a fight as Williams also tried to snatch her handbag . Williams walked away but as police were called Mr McGuire followed her and she was arrested when she attempted to run away. Williams admitted robbery. Passing sentence Judge Alan Conrad, QC, told Williams: 'You are 33 and you have a substantial record of violence. It is clear that you will attack members of the public and figures of authority when it suits you. 'This is a bad case of street robbery. The injuries were painful, distressing and lasting.' After the case Det Sgt Sandra Nelson, from Merseyside Police said: “This attack was one of the most violent I have ever dealt with.”","Amelia Williams launched attack in 'attempt at education' she wanted in jail .

"By . Marie-louise Olson . 'Useful and funny':The cover of the new 2014 Old Farmer's Almanac publication which was released on Tuesday . Brace yourselves for a freezing winter. At least, that is according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac. The 222-year-old periodical, which is believed to be the oldest continuously published periodical in the US, has predicted 'colder-than-average temperatures' this winter with 'higher-than-average snowfall'. The Dublin, New Hampshire-based Almanac, which released its 2014 edition today, says a drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns are the reasons behind the cooler temperatures. ‘This winter will bring bitter cold and heavy snow across most of the US,’ says the publication, which dubs itself as 'useful, with a pleasant degree of humour'. It . says the cold weather will affect every region of the US except for the . lower Great Lakes, the upper Midwest and the northern states of the . Northeast. ‘Sweaters . and snow shovels should be unpacked early and kept close by throughout . the season,’ said Janice Stillman, editor of the annual periodical. Shovel time: The Old Farmer's Almanac editor, Janice Stillman, says 'sweaters and shovels should be unpacked early' this year . Snowy winter: The periodical suggests people should 'gather your jackets' to brace for the extreme temperatures . Snowball fun: There will be enough of the white stuff to keep any child occupied this winter . Success rate: The publication claims its predictions are correct based on its forecast for last year's winter . Cause of chaos: A drop in solar activity and a change in ocean patterns will be the cause of the extreme temperatures, according to the periodical . The Old Farmer's Almanac has also predicted the country will experience a warmer, drier spring with above-average temperatures. It warns that drought will be a ‘problem’ during summer in several areas, such as the southern tip of Florida; from New England westward through the Lower Lakes and Upper Midwest; from Texas and Oklahoma westward through the Desert Southwest; and in the upper Pacific Northwest. The periodical also claims there will be more rainfall than normal with an ‘active hurricane season’. It predicts a major hurricane will make landfall on the central Gulf coast in July and several hurricanes and tropical storms will threaten Florida and the Atlantic seaboard in September next year. Hurricane season: The publication predicts several tropical storms will threaten the country in September . Same, same: The Farmers' Almanac, which is 197 years old, has predicted a winter outlook for 2014 much the same as its older cousin's . Last month, the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac, which has been published for 197 years, said much the same. However, some scientists have refuted the two periodicals' meteorologic assessments. Pennsylvania State University . meteorologist Paul Knight said that the Farmers' Almanac makes forecasts, which are so . vague that it is difficult to assess whether they are accurate or not. In a report published on the university's news website, Mr Knight states: 'The ability to predict events that far in advance is zero. There's no proven skill, there's no technique that's agreed upon in science to be able to do that. In its bicentennial edition, the Almanac stated, 'neither we nor anyone else has as yet gained sufficient insight into the mysteries of the universe to predict weather with anything resembling total accuracy.' However, according to the new 2014 edition of the Old Farmer’s Almanac, their forecast for last year’s winter was ‘nearly perfect’. ‘We were correct in our forecast temperature change from the previous winter in 15 of the 16 regions – yielding an accuracy rate greater than 94 per cent.’ And therefore, Old Farmer’s Almanac leaves its advice, as a chilling reminder: ‘Gather your jackets and light up a fire! It is going to be cold outside!’","The Old Farmer's Almanac says temperatures will be colder-than-average with higher-than-average snowfall .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated Press . Rescue teams failed to find any sign Monday of three men missing after a ridge saturated with rain collapsed, sending mud sliding for 3 miles in a remote part of western Colorado. Clancy Nichols, 51, a county road and bridge employee, his son Danny, 24, and Wes Hawkins, 46, have been missing since Sunday after the ridge collapsed. They went to check on damage from an initial slide near the edge of Grand Mesa, one of the world's largest flat-topped mountains, after a rancher reported that his irrigation ditch had stopped flowing, Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey said. 'Everyone on this mountain is praying for a miracle right now,' Hilkey said. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: Hundreds of trees are knocked down where a massive mudslide happened near Collbran, Colorado. Rescue teams are searching for three men missing . Damage: the aftermath of the Mesa County mudslide is seen from a plane on Monday nearly Collbran, Colorado . The search near the small town of Collbran has been hampered because only the lower third of the slide is stable. Even at the edges, the mud is 20 to 30 feet deep. It's believed to be several hundred feet deep and about a half mile wide. Deputies estimate that the entire ridge had been moving for most of Sunday before someone called to report the slide at 6:15 p.m., describing it as sounding like a freight train. Hilkey believes runoff from Grand Mesa from recent rain triggered the slide. A hydrologist from the Natural Weather Service and a geologist from the U.S. Geological Survey were helping authorities assess the situation. Hawkins' cousin, Bill Clark, said he went along with Clancy and Danny Nichols to check on why an irrigation ditch had stopped flowing because he works for an area water district. He said he has a family and young children. Clark, who visited the canyon where the slide struck, said it was completely filled with mud. He said the slide struck with so much force that some also spilled over into the neighboring draw. 'I've never seen so much earth move like that in my life,' he said. From a distance of about 10 miles, the slide looked like a funnel, narrowing into a culvert below. It cut a giant channel through trees. The creek that once gradually flowed down the ridge now spurted down like a waterfall. Roads in the area, where some cattle grazed, were muddy from rain. Three people are missing after a massive mudslide on Grand Mesa, pictured, in western Colorado . 'How in the devil could this happen?' said Collbran resident Lloyd Power, gazing out at the slide. He said residents were praying for the missing. 'That's all we can do,' Power said. While the surrounding area is popular place for fishing, hiking and camping, the slide hit on land with an access gate that isn't open to the public. No one else is believed missing and no homes were damaged. Energy companies were monitoring oil and gas wells in the area, part of the productive Piceance Basin, but so far the mud has only come up to the edge of one pad operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp. The three wells there have been shut down, said David Ludlam, executive director of the West Slope Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group. Hilkey said he'd received a telephone call from authorities in Washington state, where a March 22 landslide swept a square mile of dirt, sand and silt through a neighborhood in Oso, about an hour northeast of Seattle. That slide leveled homes and killed at least 43 people. The Mesa County sheriff's department estimated the slide is about 4 miles long, 2 miles wide and about 250 feet deep in many places. 'This slide is unbelievably big,' Mesa County Lt. Phil Stratton said. The site is in a . rural part of the county and there were no reports of any structures . damaged or major roads affected, McCammon said. A . unified incident command was established between Plateau Valley . Fire Department and the Mesa sheriff, to handle the slide and search for . the people possibly caught in it. Like a freight train: The mudslide came down just to the east of Grand Junction in Colorado on Sunday evening . Authorities said the heavy rains that fell over the weekend contributed to the slide. The . avalanche occurred about two months after a massive mudslide hit the . Washington state community of Oso on March 22, killing 43 people. The National Weather Service in Boulder, Colorado issued an advisory . this month warning that monsoon rains which caused flooding in the state . last September could increase the possibility of landslides as the . state's deep snowpack melts. 'The September 2013 rains likely . destabilized hillsides and steep slopes, so increased landslides and . rock slides will also be possible this spring, particularly with heavier . or prolonged rainfall,' the weather service said. Roadblocks have been set up to keep people from the rural area. Conditions are described as 'very unstable' by authorities.","Clancy Nichols, 51, a county road and bridge employee, his son Danny, 24, and Wes Hawkins, 46, have been missing since Sunday .

A 44-year-old Houston bus driver has been arrested after allegedly holding a 12-year-old girl against her will aboard the bus and making sexual advances. Court documents state that Carlos Guzman also planned his assault on the girl on May 5 and placed tape on the lenses of the front and rear bus cameras to obscure their view. He is accused of not stopping for his alleged victim when she asked, pulling over and then trying to touch and rub the girl's leg. Guzman reportedly hugged the girl and kissed her on the neck before she could push him away. According to police the girl managed to block Guzman's advances with her violin and backpack. Guzman allegedly told her he 'really liked her' and also said, 'I know you're only 12 but we could be together.' The girl told police that she missed her normal stop in her way home from school and intended to get off at her friend's stop. However, she apparently changed her mind and as Guzman continued on and refused to take her home she became concerned.

Founded in 1682 by King Charles II, and designed by Sir Christopher Wren, the hospital cares for elderly and injured soldiers and is home to around 300 male and female pensioners. Before its refurbishment, each floor of the home - which accommodated up to 36 pensioners - only had one bathroom at the end of the corridor. The lack of bathroom facilities is one of the main reasons for the refurbishment of the 17th-century hospital, which is set in 66-acres of grounds in the sought-after Chelsea area of London. It was when the new managers took over around six years ago that plans for the revamp got underway. They built the Margaret Thatcher Infirmary block, designed by Prince Charles' favourite architect Quinlan Terry, in the north-east corner of the grounds. The £29m building, funded by donations from the public, came complete with 125 en-suite rooms, a gym, doctor’s surgery, pool and chapel.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You might think that the creation of a new alien belongs within the pages of a science fiction novel. But a replicating ‘alien’ life-form has been made by scientists who introduced DNA molecules not found in nature to a common bacterium. The E. coli bugs are able to grow and reproduce as normal despite containing two extra letters in their genetic code. In future, the research could lead to creation of microbes capable of manufacturing entirely new proteins, which could prove lead to new medicines and nanotechnology. It's life, but not quite as we know it: A replicating 'alien' life-form has been made by scientists who introduced DNA molecules not found in nature to a common bacterium (stock image). The E. coli bugs are able to grow and reproduce as normal despite containing two extra letters in their genetic code . However, some people are worried that the rapid advance of ‘synthetic biology’ could lead to the worrying prospect of new life-forms escaping from the laboratory with unpredictable consequences. Nature’s genetic code consists of a DNA alphabet of just four ‘letters’ - adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).  An additional letter, uracil (U), is found in DNA’s close cousin molecule, RNA. The A, C, G and T building blocks form ‘base pair’ partnerships whose sequences make up all life forms. ‘Life on Earth in all its diversity is encoded by only two pairs of DNA bases, A-T and C-G, and what we’ve made is an organism that stably contains those two plus a third, unnatural pair of bases,’ lead scientist Dr Floyd Romesberg, from the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, said. ‘This shows that other solutions to storing information are possible and of course, takes us closer to an expanded-DNA biology that will have many exciting applications - from new medicines to new kinds of nanotechnology.’ The work, reported in the journal Nature, involved overcoming a billion years of evolution to get the expanded genetic alphabet into living bacteria. 'Life on Earth in all its diversity is encoded by only two pairs of DNA bases, A-T and C-G, and what we've made is an organism that stably contains those two plus a third, unnatural pair of bases,' lead scientist Dr Floyd Romesberg, from the Scripps Research Institute said. An illustration of a DNA molecule is pictured . It started in 2008 when Dr Romesberg’s team of researchers succeeded in replicating unnatural base pairs in a test tube. They also managed to transcribe the semi-synthetic DNA into RNA - a first step towards translating a new genetic code into a protein. But performing the same trick in the complex environment of a living cell presented much greater challenges. To solve the problem the scientists first added the artificial base pair molecules - d5SICS and dNaM - to a fluid solution outside the cell. Then they used a special transporter molecule, made by a species of micro-algae, to import them into the bacteria. The team first replicated unnatural base pairs in a test tube and transcribed semi-synthetic DNA into RNA - the first step in translating a new genetic code into a protein. They then added artificial base pair molecules to a fluid solution outside the cell, before using a special transporter molecule to import them into the bacteria. Using this technique, the scientists were able to synthesise circular loops of DNA known as plasmids and insert them into E. coli. Although the plasmids were separate from the organism’s integral chromosomal DNA, they became part of its replicating genetic material. The team were pleasantly surprised when the semi-synthetic plasmids didn't hamper the growth or reproduction of the bacteria. ‘That was a big breakthrough for us - an enabling breakthrough,’ said co-author Dr Denis Malyshev, also from the Scripps Research Institute. The scientists were able to synthesise circular loops of DNA known as plasmids and insert them into E. coli. The plasmid DNA contained natural A-T and C-G base pairs together with a d5SICS-dNaM base pair. Although the plasmids were separate from the organism’s integral chromosomal DNA, they became part of its replicating genetic material. To the surprise of the team, the semi-synthetic plasmids did not hamper the growth of the E.coli bacteria to any great extent. Nor did they show any sign of shedding their artificial components. The next step will be to demonstrate that unnatural DNA within bacteria can be transcribed into the RNA molecules that feed genetic instructions to protein-making machinery in cells. ‘In principle, we could encode new proteins made from new, unnatural amino acids, which would give us greater power than ever to tailor protein therapeutics and diagnostics and laboratory reagents to have desired functions,’ said Dr Romesberg. ‘Other applications, such as nanomaterials, are also possible.’ Commenting on the research in a Nature article, Ross Thyer and Jared Ellefson, from the University of Texas, wrote: ‘If the technique...works for other pairs, then the DNA code could be extended well beyond three base pairs. ‘This raises fundamental questions about why life settled on only two in the first place, and whether semi-synthetic organisms with the capacity to store more information will have expanded capabilities or endure intolerable fitness costs.’ ‘Attempts to expand the genetic alphabet bravely question the idea of the universal nature of DNA, and potentially draw criticism about the wisdom of tinkering with it,' they added.","Researchers at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, introduced DNA molecules not found in nature to a common bacterium .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A couple claims they discovered images of a ghostly Victorian girl when flicking back through family photos taken during a trip to the museum. John Burnside and Shona Backhouse, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, say they had a 'funny feeling' when they visited the Castle Museum in York two years earlier with their son Johnthomas, then 18 months. But it was only when they looked back through the snapshots two years later they noticed a faint black and white figure lurking in the images. Spooky: Shona Backhouse from Wakefield posed for this photo during a trip with her family to the Castle Museum in York. Two years later she claims she saw this black and white image of a young girl in Victorian costume (bottom right), as her and her partner flicked back through the photos . Mr Burnside, 27, said: 'It's enough to make you paranoid. It gives me goose bumps every time I think about it.' The couple decided to look through the photos after Mr Burnside found his old mobile phone memory card in his pyjama pocket. It was only then that they spotted the ghostly figure. Mr Burnside said: 'It was weird. I didn't notice anything at first, then I thought I was imagining it. So I asked Shona and she said 'Yes. It's a little girl.' 'When I phoned my mum she at first thought it might be a little girl that my sister lost, but my dad spotted that the girl in the picture was in Victorian dress. 'I don't like the idea of ghosts or anything like that. It gives me panic attacks.' 'Followed': John Burnside, pictured here with his 18-month-old son Johnthomas, found the memory card in his pyjama pocket two years after they visited the museum. He says he made out this ghostly image of a young girl when he looked back on the photos . There have been claims in the past at Castle Museum is haunted. A . crew filming an episode of Derek Acorah's Ghost Towns programme in 2006 . insisted they had heard shrill voices and seen ghostly children running . around. Mr Burnside said: 'There was not a little girl like that on the day at the museum. It was pretty dead there to be honest all through the day. Anyway, it looks like you can see right through her. 'It . is even more incredible when you think how many times those pyjamas . have been through the wash with the memory card in the pocket.' His . partner Miss Backhouse, 25, who works in a tanning salon, said: 'It is . like it was following us because it was in the last picture of me taken . outside. 'It is really weird. I never noticed it until other day when we looked through the pictures. 'Funny feeling': Miss Backhouse told her partner that one of the rooms in the museum gave her 'goosebumps and shivers'. The couple claim the shadowy figure must have followed the family around the museum . 'But I told John when was at the museum that I had funny feeling and didn't like it there. 'The room one of pics was taken in I wouldn't go inside. It gave me goosepimples and shivers. 'Our son was around 18 months' old at the time. I can't really remember if he sensed anything - but I know I didn't like it at all though.' Museum officials said they had no idea who the figure in the photographs might be. Meanwhile, there has been increasing popularity for apps to create or enhance peoples' own ghost photos, such as Ghost Capture. The app's developers boast that users can 'choose from creepy Victorian children, faceless torsos, Civil War soldiers, ghostly orbs, and more'.

"By . Richard Spillett . Johura Begum, pictured in a head scarf rather than a burkha at a previous court appearance, has already been jailed for eight months for her part in the fraud which her husband was also jailed for today . A curry house owner who falsely claimed £41,000 in benefits - which his burkha-wearing wife spent on designer clothing - has been jailed for 15 months. Mohammed Chowdhury, 33, claimed he only earned £40 a week as a restaurant waiter despite running a thriving business in Colchester, Essex with a turnover of £400,000 a year. He also pocketed housing and council tax benefit after failing to tell authorities his home was rented from his mother-in-law. Chowdhury’s partner, mother-of-two Johura Begum, 32, spent £13,000 of the cash on clothing at Burberry and Reiss, £1,200 on bedroom furniture and £130 a time on regular trips to the hairdresser, London's Old Bailey heard. Begum, who claimed she could not work because of injuries she suffered in a car accident, has already been jailed for eight months for her part in the fraud. Chowdhury, who spent the rest of the money on his drug habit, failed to turn up to court for his sentencing hearing today. Judge Richard Marks QC sentenced him in his absence because of his repeated breaches of bail. The judge said: ‘An amount of greed appears to have motivated these offences. ‘Given he has a longstanding addiction to class A drugs I am driven to the conclusion that, of the two of them, he was far and away the most culpable and was unquestionably the initiator of the offences.’ Chowdhury and his wife admitted making three fraudulent income support claims to the Department of Work and Pensions in 2010, two in 2011, and a single claim in 2009. They also admitted making a fraudulent housing benefit claim between February 9 and March 2, 2007, by not declaring that a relative owned the property at Inworth Walk, Colchester. Benefits cheat Chowdhury owned the Spices Tandoori in Colchester, Essex, which made £400,000 a year . Chowdhury owned the Spices Restaurant in . Colchester, but told benefits authorities he could only get . around 16 hours waiting work a week for which he was paid between £30 . and £40. On one application form, Begum claimed she had nothing in her bank account when she had taken out nearly £800 that day. Mohammed Chowdhury scammed £41,000 in benefits after failing to tell authorities he had a business with a £400,000 a year turnover . ‘There . were extensive shopping expeditions including trips to the hairdresser . which cost her £130,’ said prosecutor Pauline Thompson. ‘She had a penchant for visits to the high-end shops in Canary Wharf. 'This was a lady who purchased her groceries in Waitrose. She also spent £400 at Burberry and £200 at Reiss.’ Begum also made a bogus benefits claim to Tower Hamlets Council after the couple moved in with her parents in Poplar, east London. After her arrest, Begum insisted she had no idea her husband ran his own restaurant or that her parents owned a property in Ipswich. She claimed she was in fear of her husband, who refused to let her out of the house or get a job. When she was jailed in December last year she shouted: ‘Prison? I’ve got two children.' Chowdhury, of Ipswich, Suffolk admitted six . counts of fraud by false representation. Begum, of Poplar, east London, admitted seven charges of fraud by false representation.","Mohammed Chowdhury claimed he only worked 16 hours a week as a waiter .

"By . Bianca London . A Korean artist has created surrealistic fantasies based on traditional fairy tales, dreams and stories using incredible props in a tiny studio. Jee Young Lee’s Stage of Mind, a project which she has been working on continuously since 2007, sees her construct scenes for her camera rather than employing the traditional method of taking photos of images such as still lifes, figures, or landscapes. Her stage for these fictional scenes, which she says convey her psychological state, is her room-sized studio in Seoul, measuring just 360 x 410 x 240 centimetres. Lee, 30, assumes the roles of set designer, sculptor, performer, installation artist, and photographer and she is the protagonist of each piece. Mind blowing: Jee Young Lee, a Korean artist, . has created Stage of Mind - a project which sees her construct scenes . from fairy tales and her own personal experiences in a tiny studio . At times facing away from us, at other times showing only part of her body or reclining, she inhabits her dream-like realms. Through bold materials and patterns, dramatic colours, and intriguing narratives Lee uses legends of East and West, Korean proverbs, personal childhood experiences, and her own life experience as inspiration for her work. Among Lee’s new works, which are on display at the OPIOM gallery in France, is I’ll Be Back. This piece draws upon a Korean fable in which a tiger chases desperate children into a well. A god lowers a rope from the sky and the children escape, but when the tiger cries out, a rotten rope is lowered, condemning the tiger to a miserable fate. Lee reinterprets the horror of this . inescapable situation by suggesting the possibility of survival through . her own will and her art shows her lone arm reaching for a rope just out . of reach while thousands of traditional blue fans conjure up the . threatening waters swirling around her. Bright and bold: Through bold materials and patterns and dramatic colors, Lee uses legends of East and West as inspiration for her work . My chemical romance: This piece reflects relationships and communication through the motif of pipes that are complicatedly intertwined like a maze . Childhood: This piece recalls childhood memories and shows a girl who's fast growing up from her naive childhood but doesn't want to . Broken Heart is a nod to the Korean expression 'like breaking a stone with an egg' - an ineffectual effort made in a difficult situation. Last Supper depicts the Christian image of Jesus’ last meal with the competition for limited resources illustrated by hundreds of rats racing toward a plate of cheese. Resurrection, which suggests the hope of rebirth, is inspired by Shimchungchun, a Korean novel from the Chosun dynasty about a young woman who devotes herself to her blind father, and Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais’s Ophelia (1852), which depicts Shakespeare’s character having drowned herself after going mad from loss of Hamlet’s love and the death of her father. Lee identified with the tragic heroine, rising among the water lilies. The Last Supper: Inspired by da Vinci's the Last Supper, a plague of rats move toward a plate of cheese, which depicts the world where we have to compete for limited resources to survive . Protagonist: Lee is the star of her work, sometimes facing away from us, at other times showing only part of her body in her dream-like realms . I'll Be Back: This draws upon a Korean fable in which a tiger chases desperate children into a well. A god lowers a rope from the sky by which the children escape, but when the tiger cries out, a rotten rope is lowered, condemning the tiger to a miserable fate . Resurrection: Inspired by the Story of Shim Cheong, this is a Korea folktale that touches on the meaning of death and resurrection . Panic Room and Treasure Hunt are based on Lee's own childhood memories. Amidst Panic Room’s swirling patterns, objects fly off in all directions in an absurd dizziness, while Treasure Hunt’s grassy Eden, which Lee devoted three months to crafting, evokes a child-like wonderland. Monsoon Season, which was inspired her her personal experience last summer when her studio was flooded, evokes the perils of navigating through thousands of seductive but poisonous sea anemones. Lee’s constructed realities belong to the directorial mode, employed since the 1980’s by Postmodernist photographers in repudiation of the Modernist practice that sought truth in the everyday world. Lee’s constructed image photography . has been compared to the works of German sculptor and photographer . Thomas Demand, who builds life-sized models he intends to demolish after . photographing them. Speaking about her work, she said: 'The primary motifs in this series derive from my questions about who I am at the moment. 'It . is a photographic elucidation of my concerns about my identity, . exploration about myself and search for the things that I am capable of . doing, desire to do, enjoy doing and can do well, and furthermore, my . thoughts on how I should live my life. Nightscape: This work is a collaborative piece she produced with a traditional fan-making master. Each folding fan was carefully crafted, colored and arranged to complete the scene . The Little Match Girl: Based on Hans Christian Andersen's story of the same title, this work depicts the meaning of hope as portrayed by the girl striking a match to keep her alive in the cold . Nightmare: The figure uses a magnet and paper clips to express the problems that are 'forever entangled in life', says Lee . Added touch: She adds intricate plastic creativity and theatrical performance to her art . 'I try to search for the answers to my questions and concerns through the process of photographing and the subsequent artwork. I am neither too young nor old enough, grown up but not fully formed like the fully grown but unripe fruit, and still under metamorphosis. 'I am an adult but cannot be categorised as an adult in entirety. I am an incomplete being who is not entirely independent. The main subject in my work is to reflect myself as a member of the society and as an individual who influences and is influenced by the surroundings in it. 'Therefore, through my work, I strive to complete myself by reflecting myself and to objectify my current status and situations by creating sceneries of them. 'My work, in essence, records my concerns and process of growing up. It narrates and dramatises my life stories.' Recently graduated from Seoul’s Hongik University in her native South Korea, Lee is the recipient of multiple artistic awards including the Sovereign Art Prize 2012 and is dubbed one of Korea's rising stars.

"By . Sara Malm . The wife of former president Nelson Mandela has warned that South Africa has become an ‘angry nation’, as it is refusing to deal with its apartheid past. Human rights activist Graca Machel, 67, said the nation is on the brink of 'something very dangerous' which it may not be able to stop. The Mozambican third wife of ANC icon Mandela was speaking at the memorial service of a taxi driver who died in police custody after officers tied his hands to the back of their van and dragged him to this death. Warning: Graca Machel, pictured with her husband, former president Nelson Mandela, said South Africa is 'bleeding and breathing pain' Taxi driver Mido Macia is alleged to have argued a traffic violation after which police handcuffed the 27-year-old to their vehicle in front of a horrified crowd. He was found dead two hours later in a police cell in the Daveyton township of Johannesburg, last Tuesday. At the memorial Mrs Machel said South Africa’s anger came from ‘unaddressed issues’ referring to the nation’s history of apartheid, The Telegraph reports. Mrs Machel, said a reluctance to deal with the nation’s past has resulted in an ‘increasing institutionalisation of violence and a police force which is ‘actively aggressive’ towards the public. ‘South Africa is an angry nation,’ she said. ‘We are on the precipice of something very dangerous with the potential of not being able to stop the fall.' Painful history: Graca Machel, with Nelson Mandela in 2010, said the situation is to be blamed on a reluctance to deal with lingering issues from the nations apartheid past . Torture: Mrs Machel spoke at the memorial of taxi driver Mido Macia, who was found dead in a police cell in a Johannesburg township after he was handcuffed to a police van and dragged behind it . She said: 'The level of anger and aggression is rising. This is an expression of deeper trouble from the past that has not been addressed. 'We have to be more cautious about how we deal with a society that is bleeding and breathing pain.’ She spoke out as South Africa’s justice system has grown increasingly synonymous with police brutality. In . 2011 man was beaten to death by police during a peaceful protest in the . Free State and last year, police opened fire on workers during a miners . strike, killing 34 people. Another recent case highlighting the nation's culture of violence and high number of private gun owners is that of fallen Paralympic hero Oscar Pistorius’s fatal . shooting of his partner Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius, who is currently released on . bail, argues that he accidentally shot his model girlfriend believing . her to be a burglar, using one of several firearms he kept at his mansion. Police brutality: Residents protest after the death of taxi driver Mido Macia in Daveyton, near Johannesburg, South Africa last week . Mrs Machela’s comments are likely to rattle ruling party ANC, which has been at the helm of the nation since the abolition of apartheid. Both Mrs Machela and her husband Nelson Mandela have refrained from commenting on the running of South Africa since he left his position as president 14 years ago. President Zuma, speaking to traditional leaders in parliament on Thursday, said that despite the events of recent weeks, it was wrong to paint his country as an “inherently violent place to live in’. ‘South Africa is not (a) violent country. It is certain people in our country who are violent. By and large we are not, we are peace-loving people.’ Meanwhile South Africa's Independent Police Investigative Directorate reported 232 deaths in police custody and another 488 deaths as a result of police action from early 2011 to early 2012, a ten per cent drop over the previous year.","Graca Machel said South Africa is a society 'bleeding and breathing pain'

"By . Snejana Farberov . For six decades, Floreen and Ed Hale have been inseparable, and even death could not keep them apart. On February 7, Mrs Hale, 82, passed away in a Batavia, New York, hospital, with her gravely ill husband lying next to her and holding her hand until the very end. Just 36 hours later, Ed Hale died at age 83. Hand in hand: Floreen Hale, 82 (left) passed . away earlier this month, with her dying husband of 60 years, Ed (right) holding her hand to the end . 'He was a gentleman right up to the end, waiting for her to go first,' the Hales' daughter Renee Hirsh told the blog Orlean Hub, which profiled her parents. A month ago, a wheelchair-bound Mr Hale was hospitalized in Rochester, New York, with kidney failure. On February 4, his wife was rushed to United Methodist Medical Center in Batavia 35 miles away suffering from congestive heart failure, among other ailments. The 83-year-old man was initially too weak to be . transported by ambulance to be with his dying wife, but at the request . of the family, the two hospitals worked together to reunite the spouses . in their last days. Floreen and Ed's love story began more than 60 years ago when the two met at a party. When . the young engineer went to Floreen's parents to ask for her hand in . marriage, they refused because the young woman was recovering at the . time from a horrific car accident, which claimed the life of her first . husband, whom she had married only three months earlier. Gentleman's promise: When Ed Hale came to Floreen's parents to ask her hand in marriage, he was told 'no' because the young woman was recovering from a horrific car accident, but the suitor changed his future in-laws' mind when he promised to care for her his entire life . But Ed was determined to be with Floreen and would not take 'no' for an answer, declaring to his future in-laws that he was willing to carry his beloved in his arms every day. The couple said 'I do'' May 12, 1953, and . settled in Batavia, New York, in a home designed by Mr Hale. The Hales . had two surviving children, Renee and Ricky. A third baby died in . infancy. Ed's greatest joy in life was pampering his wife and spoiling her with little tokens of affection. At a time when she worked as a telephone operator at a local hospital, Ed would bring Floreen her dinner and dessert. Ed did most of the grocery shopping for the house, and every time he went to the store, he picked up some sweet treat or flowers for Floreen. In the winter, Ed would clear his wife's car of snow and warm it up for her drive home from work, earning him the nickname 'Saint Edward' from their relatives. When Floreen's family and friends would tease her about her adoring husband, asking her what she would do without him, Floreen would reply that he was not allowed to go before her. After an active, full life, Mr Hale was diagnosed with kidney disease a little over five years ago requiring dialysis regular treatments. He also suffered several heart attacks and had diabetes, but that didn't stop him from taking his wife out almost every day. Lifetime of happiness: This summer, the Hales celebrated 60 years of marriage - a time spent raising their two children, doting on their three grand-kids and one another . Mrs Hale, known for her irrepressible sense of humor, chattiness and a penchant for colorful hair adornments, also had a laundry list of ailments, from asthma to heart disease. Still, she would dress up to go to the doctor, with Ed always by her side. Floreen's precarious health took a turn for the worse earlier this month when her lungs filled with fluid, landing her in a hospital in grave condition. At the same time, her husband was in Unity Hospital in Rochester with kidney failure. 'We were handed two death sentences,' Floreen's sister, Marlene DeCarlo, told the blog. The 83-year-old man was semi-conscious and appeared to be at death’s door, but two days after his wife's hospitalization, Ed woke up and told his daughter: 'I need to see Floreen.' What followed next was a series of negotiations between the hospitals in Rochester and Batavia, helped along by a social worker whose job it was to convince United to admit Mr Hale. The Batavia hospital agreed to accept the dying patient, but only if he was strong enough to make the 35-mile trip. Storybook love: As he lay dying from kidney failure in a hospital 35 miles away from his wife, Ed Hale asked to be taken to Floreen so he could be with her in their last moments together . As if by miracle, Ed rallied sufficiently for the short ambulance ride, arriving at United in the afternoon on February 6. His sole request was to see Floreen . The hospital prepared a room for the couple, where two beds were pushed together so they could lie next to one another and hold hands as Floreen faded away. The 82-year-old woman was pronounced dead the morning after Ed’s arrival, surrounded by dozens of friends and family. Her husband followed her a day later. ‘I think it would have been more heartbreaking to see one without the other, to see one surviving when the other was not around anymore,’ said Lisa Giattino, the Hales’ niece. ‘I think it was so beautiful the way it happened.’ The couple had a joint funeral last Thursday - the eve of Valentine’s Day - at St Mary's Catholic Church in Batavia, where friends, family and medical staff gathered to celebrate Floreen and Ed's truly undying love.","Floreen Hale, 82, died February 7 in a Batavia, New York, hospital, just 36 hours before her husband .

"By . Dan Bloom . Shot dead: This South American rhea was on the loose in Hertfordshire for almost two months . The giant South American rhea that has evaded capture for more than a month has been shot - and will be turned into gourmet sausages. Gamekeeper Stuart Howe, 65, spotted the 6ft flightless bird 70 yards away in a rape seed field and killed it with one shot to the head. The rhea, named Rita, had become a frequent sight . on Barkway Park Golf Club near Royston, Hertfordshire. But with a top . speed of 45mph, its pursuers were never able to get close. And since the six-inch claws of the female bird were said to be capable of disembowelling a grown man, many people did not want to try. But police had grown concerned the rhea, which escaped in mid-March from a smallholding belonging to experienced rhea owner Jo Clark in Starling's Green, Essex, would cause a car crash. Gamekeeper Mr Howe provided photographic of evidence of the dead bird, which some nicknamed Chris after the pop legend Chris Rea. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'I suppose some people might say it is a shame the rhea is dead but it would be terrible if it caused someone to die in a car crash. 'I saw the rhea near the roadside at one point and it would easily have caused a car to swerve and hit a tree. 'What’s the life of a bird against the life of a person or family? The police wanted it out of the way and there was no way anyone would be able to capture it.' The flightless bird resembling something between an ostrich and an emu was the butt of countless 'birdie' jokes after it made frequent appearances on the golf course. But it was deadly serious for the RSPCA, which issued a warning to residents not to approach Rita. A spokesman said: 'Rheas are large birds . and have the potential to be dangerous as they are strong, fast and have . sharp claws. Our advice to the general public is keep well away and . call us or the police if they see the bird. Scroll down for video . Harmless? The bird was spotted several times roaming the countryside, including in this rape seed field . 'We would not recommend that anyone attempts to restrain or catch a rhea themselves, as these birds are able to kick in any direction and may kick out if they feel threatened.' Local newspapers printed advice to residents on what they should do if confronted under the headline 'rhea guard action'. And one person searching for the bird, Jane Garner, said she had received a phone call from a mystery man three weeks ago warning her he would shoot the rhea on sight. She told the BBC: 'I implored him not to - it's doing no harm and there are lots of people badly trying to find a way to catch it.' A Hertfordshire Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Police have received notification that the missing Rhea has been lawfully killed near a carriageway in Anstey, as there was fear of it getting onto a main road and causing a collision. 'The owner had previously given permission for the bird to be dispatched if the situation deemed it necessary, which was the case. 'We have spoken to the owner who is aware.'","South American bird with 6in claws escaped from smallholding in March .

"By . Ben Spencer . Half a million people in Britain are living with coeliac disease without knowing it, according to new research. The disease, a digestive condition which leads to an adverse reaction to gluten in foods such as bread and pasta, can lead to a range of other medical problems if it is not diagnosed. Research by the University of Nottingham has found that only 24 per cent of people with the autoimmune condition are diagnosed. Scroll down for video . Coeliac is a digestive condition which leads to an adverse reaction to gluten in foods such as bread and pasta . The rate of diagnosis has increased four-fold in the last two decades, according to the study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology. Far more needs to be done to identify sufferers said Sarah Sleet, the chief executive of Coeliac UK. She said: ‘This latest research shows that nearly a quarter of people with coeliac disease have now been diagnosed and gives an up to date picture of the diagnosis levels across the UK. ‘Of course, increasing numbers with a diagnosis is good news and will inevitably mean that there will be an increased demand for gluten-free products in supermarkets. ‘But the three quarters undiagnosed - around 500,000 people - is a shocking statistic that needs urgent action.’ Pasta is delicious for most of us but not if you are a coeliac . Calling for supermarkets to stock at least eight core items of gluten-free food, she added: ‘Can you imagine going into your local supermarket and there is no bread you can eat, not one loaf, not one slice? ‘And when you check out the pasta, cereal or flour again there is nothing available on the shelf which means you have to trawl around two or three stores in order to be able to find your staple foods. ‘This is not about your preferred brand but about the major supermarkets ensuring that they have sufficient stock in all their stores whatever their size for this growing market of people who depend on gluten-free food for their health.’ Coeliac disease affects one in every 100 people in the UK. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye and can be found in any food containing these cereals including pasta, most types of bread, breakfast cereals, cakes and some other foods.","Coeliac disease affects one in every 100 people in the UK .

"By . Sean Poulter . A skin cancer warning has been sounded following evidence some big brand sun creams do not offer the protection they claim to give. As temperatures are predicted to hit the mid-70s this weekend, products by Malibu, Piz Buin and Hawaiian Tropic have been given a ‘don’t buy’ rating by independent reviewer Which?. The consumer champion tested 15 popular sun creams that claimed to have a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 30, as well as helping to shield the skin from UVA rays. The end for lotion? The new drinkable liquid offers up to factor 30 protection . The three . which failed were found to have a real SPF level of less than 25, while . the Malibu product also fell short of the required UVA standard. Sun exposure is linked to premature ageing and skin cancer, with evidence of 100,000 cases being diagnosed in the UK each year. Which? found that paying a high price is no guarantee of better protection, . with the most expensive brand outperformed by a cheap rival. Piz . Buin Ultra Light Dry Touch Sun Fluid SPF30, which failed the SPF test, . was the most expensive cream tested, at £11.30 per 100ml. Calypso Sun . Lotion SPF30, which was £1.20 per 100ml, passed both tests. Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘We’ve found three products that . failed the strict British Standard tests and we want to see . manufacturers doing much more to make sure their sun creams live up to . the claims on the packaging.’ All the companies behind the brands criticised by Which? insist the products meet the protection levels claimed on the packs. Researchers . tested the creams on ten volunteers, who had the same amount of each . product applied to a small area of their back before lying under a lamp . to replicate the sun’s rays. Their skin was checked for redness and . compared to the results of a lamp test with no cream. To test the suncream Which? apply a small amount to an area on a person's back before a special lamp is shone on the patch and a lab assistant checks for redness . SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream. If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes, for example, a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer – 150 minutes. While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn, UVA rays damage the skin’s DNA at a deeper layer. Both radiation types can cause skin cancer. The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF. The Malibu product failed to meet this standard. The World Health Organisation advises applying 35ml of sun cream. That equates to seven teaspoons – one for the head and neck, one for each arm and leg, and one each for the chest and back. It suggests users re-apply every two hours. Which? said: ‘A sunscreen that doesn’t offer the protection it claims could expose you to a greater risk of developing sunburn than one that meets its claim, as you will be getting less protection than you think.’ Malibu said: ‘We stand by our testing … We have nothing to hide.’ Piz Buin said all of its products are assessed in compliance with EU regulations and that it is confident its products provide the protection stated. Hawaiian Tropic said it only sells products that meet the SPF figure claimed on the pack. Temperatures are expected to reach a sweltering 25C (77F) this weekend. Pictured: Plymouth Hoe, Devon . As summer arrives at last, nature is waking up to celebrate. The glorious weather expected this weekend comes after a mild and wet winter that has provided perfect conditions for plants and wildlife to thrive. As a result, many species are stirring earlier than expected. Elderflowers are in flower, dog roses are blooming and hawthorn is at a peak – a situation not usually seen until June. Far more butterflies have also hatched than would usually be seen at this time of year. Most of Britain will be bathed in sunshine at the weekend as the mercury hits its record for the year. There will be barely a cloud in the sky for long spells as temperatures reach a sweltering 25C (77F), warmer than many parts of the Mediterranean and much hotter than the 16C (61F) average for May. The hot spell will last until Monday but will break before the Chelsea Flower Show starts on Tuesday, with unsettled weather expected for much of next week. National Trust naturalist Matthew Oates said: ‘It’s an early summer because of the mild, wet and stormy winter, and the whole thing’s rather jumped the gun.’ He added: ‘If the jet stream is kind to us, it could be a really wonderful summer.’","Products by Malibu, Piz Buin and Hawaiian Tropic given 'don't buy' rating .

"By . Harriet Arkell . An aristocrat is fighting her neighbour's plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London. Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, says rows over people digging 'mega-basements' beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a conservation area in Hampstead, where dozens have signed a petition against the application. She is one of 58 people to have objected to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house. Lady Listowel is one of dozens of locals objecting to a proposed basement in the smart north London street (file picture) Architects' plans submitted to Camden Council show the scale of the planned basement at Mrs Abiola's house . Lady Listowel, the widow of the 5th Earl of Listowel, William Francis Hare, said: 'It is sad that there is a row over the application as everyone usually gets on around here. 'These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.' Mrs Abiola bought the house, which is close to Hampstead Heath, three years ago.  Neighbours said the owners, whom they believed to be Nigerian, owned several properties in the UK and were not often at the house. An initial application featured plans to build a swimming pool under the house but was rejected by Camden Council in 2011.  The new plans incorporate a basement that would extend under the house and into the garden. Neighbour Oliver Froment, 63, said he was concerned his house might collapse if Mrs Abiola's basement were built, and said it had happened in several similar cases in Hampstead. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People are just trying to show off by building bigger and deeper, with no consideration for the character of the area or the people who live there.' Mrs Abiola's £3.6m house is in an expensive street in a conservation area near Hampstead Heath, pictured . Mr Froment, who works in financial services, has hired an independent expert who said he was concerned about the impact of the proposed works. Camden Council's Valerie Leach said: 'It is essential that the views of residents are taken into account and at present we have received a number of objections and reports that are being reviewed to ensure that planning officers can make a recommendation on the application.' Rows over vast basements are becoming increasingly common in London, where space is at a premium. Last month it emerged that a Labour peer was suing his neighbour for 'trespass' over his newly-dug basement, claiming that it went underneath his own property. Lord Mitchell claimed his Hampstead neighbour Daphne Gillian Singer had undertaken 'hidden' works by digging up a courtyard next to both of their homes.  He and his wife have lodged a writ at the High Court and are seeking up to £200,000 in damages after Ms Singer allegedly built walls beneath his property without consent. Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik boasts London's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool under his Kensington home . Earlier this year a Russian businessman renovated his mansion in London's Kensington to include a pool in the basement which is believed to be the capital's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool. Leonard Blavatnik, who is Britain's second-richest man, built the 25m pool underneath his home in Kensington Palace Gardens, which is London's most expensive street.  His basement also boasts a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine-cellar, and 'multi-storey' underground car park. Estate agents said Mr Blavatnik's property, which is yards from Kensington Palace, could be worth £200m after the tycoon undertook a massive renovation on the 13-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house.","Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, has joined Hampstead residents in protest .

"By . Emma Innes . Many men with erectile dysfunction currently face a difficult decision - they can either accept a less satisfying sex life or they can take Viagra and put up with the side effects. And these are the lucky ones - millions of men with sexual function problems do not even have the option of taking Viagra as it is not suitable for people with angina or those who have had a stroke or a heart attack. But, there could soon be another option for the millions of men with erectile problems. A new cream which is currently being trialled in the U.S. could eventually replace Viagra tablets . A U.S. biotechnology company is trialling a cream which could improve sexual function without causing side effects. Strategic Science and Technologies has completed the first phase of clinical trials of the cream, SST-6006, which has the same active ingredient as Viagra. The cream is applied directly to the man's genitals where the drug passes through the skin and into the tissue, in a bid to improve sexual function. The trial revealed that the cream causes far fewer side effects than Viagra tablets and the researchers say that any recorded side effects were mild. In contrast, Viagra is known to cause side effects including nausea, headaches, facial flushing and an upset stomach. Viagra can also not be taken by men with bleeding problems, angina, kidney problems, liver problems or those who have had a heart attack or a stroke. The cream has the same active ingredient as Viagra but does not cause the same side effects . The researchers gave some of the volunteers the cream while a control group were given Viagra. Tests . revealed that the levels of the active ingredient - sildenafil - in the . blood were more than 20 times lower in the patients who had used the . cream than in those who had taken Viagra. 'With a growing concern about systemic . side effects associated with the current oral forms of PDE-5 inhibitors, . a topical treatment approach such as SST-6006 could enable patients . with [erectile dysfunction] to benefit from a local therapeutic dose of . sildenafil directly into the penile tissue while reducing the risk of . unwanted systemic side effects,' said Dr Irwin Goldstein, Director of . Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital and Director of San Diego Sexual . Medicine. '[This is a] novel delivery technology to positively impact sexual health in both men and women.' The researchers do accept, however, that their tests are yet to confirm whether the cream actually improves sexual function. All their clinical trial as so far proved is that it is safe for use and that it does pass into penile tissue when applied directly to the skin. Erectile dysfunction is estimated to affect 13 to 20 per cent of men between the ages of 40 and 80.","The cream - SST-6006 - is being trialled by a U.S. biotechnology company .

"By . Rob Cooper . To the billionaire Chinese developer recreating it, it will be ‘like a tree from which the whole world will enjoy the shade’. Yesterday Ni Zhaoxing unveiled his £500million vision for a new Crystal Palace, which will put a missing piece of British history back in place. The vast glass structure, the original of which was home to the Great Exhibition of 1851, will house his priceless art collection plus a hotel, conference centre and ‘other commercial space’. Scroll down for video . Towering new Crystal Palace: Chinese real estate mogul Ni Zhaoxing is planning to build a new Crystal Palace structure to replace the original which was destroyed in a fire in 1936. It will be situated on a hilltop in Crystal Palace Park, south-east London, on the same spot as the original. The sport stadium is Crystal Palace athletics track . Vision: An artist's impression of what the re-built Crystal Palace could look like. If all goes to plan, building work will begin in 2015 . Interior: What the newbuild Crystal Palace Park will look like inside. The plans are being supported by London Mayor Boris Johnson . But not everyone shares his enthusiasm. Protesters and some local councillors fear the ambitious scheme will . choke one of London’s vital  green spaces. Some were there at . yesterday’s unveiling at the south London site to make their voices . heard. Mr Ni, chairman of Shanghai-based Zhong Rong Holdings, stressed that his . plan includes restoration of the park on the original Victorian design. Crystal Palace, named because of its innovative use of plate glass, was a . breathtaking symbol of the British Empire and the crowning achievement . of the Industrial Revolution. It stood in another part of the capital, . Hyde Park, where the exhibition was held. Vision: As well as rebuilding Crystal Palace the park will also be refurbished for the public. Pictured in this artist's impression is a new cafe. The new Crystal Palace structure can be seen in the distance above the trees . Flashback: The giant Crystal Palace centre before it was destroyed in a fire in 1936. The new building will be a replica of the original and cost around £500million .

Parkland: This is the spot where the original Crystal Palace stood until it was destroyed in a fire in 1936. It has never been rebuilt . It was rebuilt on Penge Common, where it was used for further exhibitions, before being destroyed by fire in 1936. All that remains are the listed Italian-style terraces and they will be incorporated in the new scheme. Mr Ni, 57, whose art collection stretches from ancient relics to . ‘world-class oil paintings’, said he was inspired to rebuild the palace . on visits to the UK while his two daughters studied here. He said the project was ‘just like falling in love, getting married and having a child’. ‘It’s long-term hard work I can pass down to the next generation,’ he said, speaking in Chinese. ‘It’s like planting a tree in Crystal Palace to grow, then I can bring . the tree to others. The whole world will enjoy the shade, local . residents foremost, and once it has fruit on it you will profit the most . – London the city and the people of London.’ Boris Johnson announces plans for the new . £500million Crystal Palace alongside Chinese billionaire Ni Zhaoxing who . is bankrolling the proposed scheme .

Community Association chairman said such a development would not be . possible today . From above now: A Shanghai-based real estate . firm will be putting a planning application in to the council later this . year - but the news has been badly received by campaigners worried . about development in the park . Last days: The Crystal Palace is shown in 1936, . illuminated by the light of a Brocks fireworks display shortly before it . burned down . Wreckage: The burnt out shell of a building which was left after the blaze in 1936. Nearly 80 years after it was destroyed, work may begin on a replacement in winter 2015 . But Nick Goy, 52, a gardener who was among the protesters, said: ‘Parks . are for people not for profit.We’re concerned it will be a commercial . operation, take away grass and trees, and change the nature of the park. ‘When the original palace was built, it stood in the countryside. Now . London is a very different place. It has expanded and we have very few . green lungs like this left.’ The scheme  is backed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who yesterday . called it a ‘brilliant, original and simple vision by which south London . will once again acquire a world-class cultural attraction’. The land is owned by Bromley Council, which said consultation will now . take place. A planning application could be submitted by next autumn, . with construction possibly starting in winter 2015. Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert had originally come up with the idea of an exhibition to show off Britain's industrial achievements.It was a huge triumph for Albert, who rarely enjoyed public popularity in Britain, and he used the profits made to help establish the South Kensington museums in central London.

"By . Ted Thornhill . A nine-year-old girl born without fingers on her left hand has had her life transformed after high school students made her a prosthetic hand using a 3D printer – for just $5. Students from Boylan Catholic High School in Rockford, Illinois, made the hand for Kylie Wicker after her father, Jeromy Wicker, discovered that another dad had made a 3D printed prosthetic hand for his son. Mr Wicker emailed the school and asked if they’d be able to embark on a similar project for Kylie after reading that they’d had a 3D printer donated to them - and was delighted when he received a reply a few days later explaining that the hand was already being worked on. Transformation: Kylie Wicker tries on a prosthetic hand at Boylan Catholic High School in Rockford, Illinois . Engineering feat: The teacher in charge of the project fits the prosthetic hand to Kylie . Rare: Kylie's unusual condition was caused by a lack of blood flow to the womb during pregnancy . The teacher in charge of the project, Mr Bud May, found instructions for the hand on a website called Robohand and said that the cost came to just a handful of dollars. Mr May told Fox News that the hand would cost ‘barely $5’, with ‘maybe a dollar’s worth of plastic and a couple of bucks for the fasteners’. Kylie, who attends Whitman Post Elementary School in Rockton, had become upset at some of the children staring at her, according to her mother, Sharon. Hi-tech: Kylie's prosthetic hand was made for a few dollars using a 3D printer called the MakerBot . Web of intrigue: Bud May, a teacher at Boylan Catholic High School, looks over instructions to make a prosthetic hand . She told Fox News: ‘They weren’t being mean, they were just curious and didn’t understand it.’ Kylie is delighted with her new hand, which will allow her to pick things up in the way other children can. But she is especially looking forward to being able to ride her bike more easily. ‘I can grab both handle bars and steer a little bit better,’ she said. The school has made her two hands – a purple one and a pink one – and said they will make her another set when she’s older. Mrs Wicker added in an interview with ABC: ‘She hasn’t stopped talking about it. This is huge for [the students], too. To give a girl a hand; how many people can say that? This is great for everybody.’ Kylie’s condition was caused by a lack of blood flow to the womb when Mrs Wicker was pregnant. In a far more ambitious project, U.S scientists are attempting to 3D print a whole human heart. So far, the University of Louisville in Kentucky has printed human heart valves and small veins with cells, said Stuart Williams, a cell biologist leading the project. They have also successfully tested the tiny blood vessels in mice and other small animals and Professor Williams believes scientists will be able to print parts and assemble an entire heart in three to five years. The finished product would be called the ‘bioficial heart’ - a blend of the natural and artificial. The biggest challenge is to get the cells to work together as they do in a normal heart, said Professor Williams, who heads the project at the Cardiovascular Innovation Institute, which is a partnership between the university and Jewish Hospital in Louisville.","Kylie Wicker from Illinois was born without fingers on her left hand .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Wednesday's Republican primary debate for the Idaho governor's race was broadcast on a 30-second delay because one of the candidates, the leader of a biker gang, is known for public profanity and making racist jokes. He's no fan of law-enforcement, complaining during the debate that motorcycle riders 'are cop-magnets, like a Playboy bunny in a mini-skirt gets hit on all the time,' comparing their treatment to that of blacks before the civil rights movement. Another fringe hopeful on the stage insists that nuclear accidents were foretold in the Bible, and that every American should take potassium iodide tablets to protect their thyroid glands. Sitting Governor Butch Otter insisted that any debate must include long-shot candidates who qualify for the May 20 primary. If he was looking for comic relief, he got it in spades. 'I don't like political correctness. Can I say this? It sucks! It's bondage,' Harley Brown told a statewide audience on Idaho Public Television. He was missing a front tooth and spoke with a cigar stuck in his shirt pocket. 'You have your choice, folks: A cowboy, a . curmudgeon, a biker or a normal guy. Take your pick!' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The 2014 Idaho Republican primary debate for governor presented voters with the choice between 'a cowboy, a curmudgeon, a biker or a normal guy.' Pictured (L-R) are Harley Brown, Walt Bayes, Gov. Butch Otter and state Sen. Russ Fulcher . Straight face: Walt Bayes nearly brought Gov. Butch Otter to giggles when he claimed his wife had driven for three years without a license because she refused to take her car for emissions testing, and 'nobody done nothing' Harley Brown assured his fellow candidates: 'Don't think I'm crazy, 'cause I?m not.' Brown, a . former Boise cab driver whose biker jacket is emblazoned with the . slogan, 'Hey diddle diddle, right up the middle,' said that he's 'about . as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl. And I'm . proud of it, and I'm going for it.' 'And I'm going for the vote of the real people out there, not these bondage-type people who don't have a clue about picking up strangers at night and hauling them God-knows-where,' he added. 'Try that for awhile.' His plan for taking back land rights from the federal government is a blueprint for online mockery. Future Republican president? Harley Brown called himself 'about as politically correct as your proverbial turd in the punchbowl' 'I've got a Master's in raisin' hell, okay? ... Here's my plan of attack,' he told Spokesman-Review political writer Betsy Russel, one of the debate moderators. 'You go in there, and you use spiritual warfare.' 'You bind those evil spirits that are behind the feds with the blood of Jesus, the name of Jesus, the power of entombment of the Holy Spirit, the power of agreement, the word of God. Take air superiority, and then roll in with your tanks on the ground, like ... lawsuits. Blitzkrieg!' 'Mr. Brown,' Russell deadpanned when he was done, 'the question was about taxes.' Competing for a role as Saturday Night Live's next national lampoon was Walt Bayes, a walking caricature of Uncle Jesse from 'The Dukes of Hazzard,' He scorched Otter for allowing the federal government to dictate forest policy –  'Our forests are cut like somebody raising tomatoes: ""Well, they're purty red, don't pick 'em""' – and railed against Idaho's history of jailing home-schooling parents. 'What would you do if they came out to take your kids?' he asked. 'Well, I'd shoot 'em – what else would you do?' At one point Bayes, whose nametag was misspelled throughout the debate, slammed the governor for his un-Republican demands that cars meet strict emissions standards. 'He tried to make me take an emissions test,' the elderly candidate complained, 'and I told him what to do with it.' 'My wife drove for three years without any license over it,' Bayes boasted. 'Nobody done anything.' The moment that will likely go viral, however, came when Idaho Statesman political columnist Dan Popkey asked Brown to explain his online, off-color humor. 'You've posted bigoted jokes on your website,' Popkey sniped, 'skewering women and gays and Jews and Asians and Polish people like me.' 'And bikers and Irishmen too. I hit myself,' Brown responded. Watch the full debate at Idaho Public Television . That settles it: In his closing statement, Brown produced a laminated letter that he claimed was from an African bishop, certifying that almighty God had told him he would be President of the United States someday . Bayes told a TV audience of potential Republican voters that the Bible foretold the Chernobyl nuclear accident and predicts more radiation disasters in the future . 'Those ""Harleyisms,"" as I call it, had a lot of warnings on there – you know, ""You might find this offensive"",' he explained. 'But I hit everybody. Jews, Polish people, Irish, Italians, religious jokes and black jokes.' 'And by . the way, my wife screened that. And we took the real hard-core zingers . out. So in case I catch any flak ... I can fire that back and attack my . attackers.' Idaho gubernatorial fringe candidate Harley Brown drew heat during the debate for posting bigoted jokes on his campaign website. In an online disclaimer, he warns that they 'may be construed by those of a gentle nature, a sensitive disposition or the young, to be offensive, shocking or even obscene.' Here are some of the ones we can print.: . Otter and his more mainstream challenger, state Sen. Russ Fulcher, struggled to keep a straight face. One heated exchange focused on Otter's early support for – and later flip-flop on – a federal ban on hunting wolves. 'Our wolves – they're here because we let somebody put 'em here,' Bayes said. 'Governor Otter wants to kill a wolf. I did kill a wolf while it was still an endangered species.' Bayes turned his closing statement into a non-sequitur rant against nuclear energy, claiming that scripture foretold an infamous 1986 nuclear accident in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine. 'You remember Chernobyl, where the Russians had a little problem with their atomic energy?' he recalled. 'Chernobyl – when you translate that into English it comes out ""Wormwood."" Wormwood is mentioned in the Bible a whole lot where you're studying the last days, and it's radiation.' He urged the debate audience to take potassium iodide pills in order to block their thyroid glands from radiation poisoning. The pills are 'good for 20 years,' he said, 'and I'd rather have it 20 years early than 5 minutes late.' 'When that little deal happened in Japan – just like that, you couldn't buy it. You couldn't find any anywhere.' 'And another thing you want to know is our energy plants that's run by atomic, they can stand one-fifteenth of an earthquake like that one in Japan!' Bayes concluded. 'And my Bible says it's going to get worse and worse and worse!' But Brown stole the show with his closing monologue, claiming that the Idaho governorship would be just a test-run for the White House. 'I need practice! Practice!' he said. 'I . don't want to say stuff like, ""Sorry if our bombing caused you any . inconvenience."" So I want to work in the Little League, as the governor.' And in Blues Brothers fashion, Brown is on a mission from God. 'If the Supreme Court goes to hell, I'm not following,' Walt Bayes said, pledging to enforce state laws on abortion regardless of the federal government's position . 'After God told me he was going to make me president, I went out and got the Presidential Seal tattooed right here on my shoulder,' he boasted. 'My morale went from negative 500 off the scale, and I started a presidential campaign right there. I'm a type A-A-plus guy.' 'And I was living in Fat Jack's cellar 'cause my ex-wife had given me trumped-up restraining orders,' he continued. 'I couldn't see my kids. It was a mess. And Fat Jack's old lady, Fat Jack's wife, said, ""Get this lunatic out of my cellar! He's starting a presidential campaign! I'm getting calls from the media on all this!""' 'For three years I had the credibility of Chicken Little – you know, ""The sky is falling""? And finally, one day this bishop from African comes over. He says, ""I am a prophet of the most high God, and in that office I here authenticate that God told you that."" I says, ""Yeah? You mind putting that in writing?"" He said, ""Sure.""' As Brown pulled a laminated letter out of his pocket, he delivered his coup de grace. 'And he put it in writing, and I got the original at home and I was able to go up to all my detractors and say, ""Naah-na-naaah-na-naah-naah!""'","One candidate is a motorcycle gang leader  who claims God told him he'll be president someday, and whose website includes dozens of racist jokes .

"By . Mark Prigg . A photographer has captured an incredibly rare glimpse of one of the most secretive drone programmes on the planet. Known as 'the Avenger', the drone has already been tested in Afghanistan, and can be easily spotted by its distinctive 'goldeneye' glass, which shield's the delicate sensing optics system. It can cruise at 400mph, fly up to 60,000 feet depending on the configuration and can stay airborne for over 18 hours. Scroll down for video . The Avenger drone, captured on a test flight over a highly remote old army airfield turned radar cross-section measurement range thirty miles east of Palmdale California . Maximum speed: 460 mph; 741 km/h (400 kn) Endurance: 20 hours with standard fuel . Service ceiling: 60,000 ft (18,288 m) operating altitude . Can house about 3,500 lbs of smart bombs . Can be controlled by a single pilot . Optics hidden behind a series of gold plated, faceted windows. Aviation photographer Ian Tate caught quite the secret craft in action at General Atomics' drone plant located in the Mojave Desert. He was hoping to photograph a Predator or Reaper UAVs, but instead he caught one of the elusive test drones. General Atomics, which also makes nuclear reactors and maglev trains, already makes many of the most popular military drones, including the Predator. The idea behind the Avernger was to design an unmanned plane that had modular sensors, good performance, good stealth, and good payload, and could be used as a workhorse' drone. The Avenger will also be equipped with an electro-optical targeting system that will preserve its stealthy radar signature by placing the aircraft's optics behind a series of gold plated, faceted windows. The firm is also believed to have tested the Avenger with its new Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station, which features wrap around screens that repeat the video feed from a distributed camera system mounted around the Avenger. It is also rumored that the Avenger is also being developed with a signals and communications intelligence payload for eavesdropping on the enemy, even while loitering over their own airspace. The Avenger can house about 3,500 lbs of smart bombs, including small diameter bombs (SDB) that can glide over 50 miles from the Avenger's height, and strike threatening enemy radar emitters as they pop up. The firm is also believed to have tested the Avenger with its new Advanced Cockpit Ground Control Station, which features wrap around screens that repeat the video feed from a distributed camera system mounted around the Avenger. The Avenger is set to be a general purpose drone, and is believed to have already been used in Afghanistan. The Avenger can stay airborne for over 18 hours, and possibly longer if fuel tanks are installed in its weapons bay. In December 2011, the Air Force announced that it had ordered an Avenger and that it was being deployed to Afghanistan. 'This aircraft will be used as a test asset and will provide a significantly increased weapons and sensors payload capacity on an aircraft that will be able to fly to targets much more rapidly than the MQ-9 [Reaper] UAS,' the USAF said in an announcement. 'Since it has an internal weapons bay and four hardpoints on each wing it will also allow greater flexibility and will accommodate a large selection of next generation sensor and weapons payloads.' It can cruise at 400mph, and reach up to 60,000 feet depending on the configuration . The Avenger will also be equipped with an electro-optical targeting system that will preserve its stealthy radar signature by placing the aircraft's optics behind a series of gold plated windows.","Drone has distinctive golden glass shielding its optics systems .

"By . Lizzie Parry . and Emma Innes . She has survived three brain haemorrhages, each of which could have killed her. Despite stunning doctors by cheating death, Ellie Calder continues to live with a ticking timebomb in her head, which threatens to claim her life at any moment. The 20-year-old suffers from an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a rare mass of abnormal blood vessels, that can haemorrhage at random. Ellie Calder, 20, has already had three brain haemorrhages and could have another one at any moment . Miss Calder, from Nantwich in Cheshire, was seven years old when she suffered her first brain bleed. Four years later the second struck, followed by the third haemorrhage when she was 16. But despite living at risk of suffering a fatal brain bleed at any moment, Miss Calder refuses to let her condition affect her life. She said: 'Sometimes I can’t quite believe how lucky I am - I know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable. 'A lot of people would have a permanent disability, but I’m fortunate to have no lasting damage. 'The hope is that through the treatment I’m receiving from the incredible people at the Walton Centre in Liverpool, the AVM will shrink and disappear completely. Miss Calder (pictured with her boyfriend in hospital) has an abnormal mass of blood vessels in her brain which can haemorrhage dangerously without warning . Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, William) had her first haemorrhage when she was seven. She had her second one four years later and her third one when she was 16 . 'It’s amazing to think that one day I might not have to live with this. 'I try not to think too much about the risks of what I’m living with as I’d just scare myself - there’s no point living in fear. 'Thanks to the Walton I live just like any other girl my age - I go to uni, I have friends and an amazing boyfriend - I owe everything to them really. 'I just try not to focus on my condition, and get on with my life.' An arteriovenous malformation in the brain is a tangle of abnormal blood vessels. Normally, arteries carry high pressure blood and veins carry lower pressure blood but in an AVM blood is diverted directly from the arteries to the veins. They can cause brain haemorrhages, seizures, headaches and difficulty with movement, speech and vision. Brain AVMs occur in less than one per cent of people - they are more common in men than women. It is not known why they occur but patients are usually born with them. Treatment options include surgery and radiosurgery. Source: American Stroke Association . Miss Calder was just seven years old when she collapsed on Boxing Day, having had her first subarachnoid haemorrhage. She said: 'I don’t remember much of it as I was so young, but all of a sudden I was totally unable to move my arms and legs. 'I was rushed to hospital, but after a few tests and investigations I was discharged. 'My parents were really worried as they were sure that something more was wrong.' Four years later, while at school, Ms Calder was struck down with another bleed. She said: 'I wasn’t really able to comprehend what had happened or the seriousness of the situation. 'But again I remember waking up and not being able to use my legs. 'I was at the Walton Centre for two weeks - at first I was treated with suspected meningitis but then a consultant sent me for a CT scan. 'It was that that they discovered I had an AVM about 5cm by 5cm just millimetres away from my brain stem. It was a shock to everyone - we just had no idea.' Miss Calder was told that she would be monitored twice a year, and would undergo gamma knife radiosurgery to reduce the size of the AVM. But the condition struck again the day before Miss Calder's high school prom. She said: 'I’d had my nails and tan done and was in the shower when I experienced a sudden sharp pain. Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, Karl) has, amazingly, not suffered any long term brain damage following the brain haemorrhages that she had suffered so far . Miss Calder (pictured with her stepmother and baby sister) is now hoping doctors will be able to shrink the growth to prevent her having another bleed . 'It felt as though someone had hit me on the back of the head with a shovel. 'The next thing I can remember is looking down at my hands and seeing my nails had grown out and my tan was patchy where the tubes and drips were. 'I cried and cried when I realised I’d missed my prom. 'This time I underwent a surgery called endovascular surgery, but I lost the ability to walk or see properly - I couldn’t even do basic things. 'It was like my brain just didn’t want to work properly anymore, and I was warned that in 50 per cent of cases it could be permanent. 'It was pretty terrifying but the Walton Centre staff helped me to walk and see again. Miss Calder (pictured with her brother, William, and sister, Florence) says the abnormal blood vessels are too close to her brain stem to enable surgeons to operate . Miss Calder said: 'Sometimes I can't quite believe how lucky I am - I know that to survive three brain haemorrhages is pretty remarkable' 'Thanks to them I was out of hospital within a few months and starting college - I really owe my life to them.' Ms Calder's AVM is still present, but so close to her brain stem that it makes open brain surgery impossible. She continues to be monitored at the Walton Centre, and hopes the radiosurgery will continue to shrink the AVM until it disappears altogether. She said: 'I try not to let my AVM and what it could do affect me - I’ve known about it from such a young age so I’m used to the idea now and I feel normal. 'The only symptom I get is migraines but it could be a lot worse. 'I can’t go too crazy on the rides at Alton Towers, and I have to be a bit careful if I go on nights out - but apart from that I’m a normal university student. Miss Calder (pictured with her grandfather) said: 'I try not to think too much about the risks of what I'm living with as I'd just scare myself - there's no point living in fear' 'I just have to stay positive, and one day hope that I can put all this behind. 'I’m fortunate to have an incredible family, boyfriend, and group of friends that keep me positive.' Consultant neuroradiologist Dr Hans Nahser of The Walton Centre said: 'A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) consists of abnormal connections between arteries and veins. 'They appear in the brain as tangles of blood vessels and are usually diagnosed following a scan after someone feels ill with symptoms such as headaches or a seizure. 'In serious cases the blood vessels can rupture and be the cause of a disastrous bleed in the brain, known as a brain haemorrhage. Miss Calder is pictured with her family. L to R: brother Karl, stepmother Christine, brother Charlie, sister Florence, brother Matthew, brother William and father, Arthur . 'Brain AVMs are still considered to be maldevelopments of cerebral arteries you are born with. 'At The Walton Centre brain AVMs are treated in a range of ways including open neurosurgical operations, endovascular embolisation, stereotactic radiosurgery or a combination of these treatments. 'Endovascular embolisation is a minimally invasive treatment using microcatheters through the arterial system to block of the arteriovenous shunts with special glue.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . If several Western media outlets are to be believed, there's a new trend in China where teens have started to take heads of cabbage on walks on leashes to combat loneliness and depression. 'I have more interest for my cabbage than I do my parents. I feel it understands me,' the Huffington Post quoted a Chinese teen as saying in an article published earlier this month. 'I feel I can transfer my negative thoughts about myself to the cabbage, go for a walk with it and come home feeling better about myself,' the website quotes another Chinese teen as saying. 'Trend': Western news outlets like the Huffington Post erroneously reported a 'trend' involving Chinese teens walking cabbage to cope with loneliness . 'Art': The 'cabbage patch kids,' as they've been called, actually are participating in a piece of 'performance art' by a Chinese 'artist' The only problem, however, is that it isn't true - not all of it, anyway. Indeed, Chinese teens have been spotted walking around the streets of Beijing lugging heads of cabbage behind them on leashes. But it isn't new, it isn't a 'trend,' and it has nothing to do with combating loneliness. Rather, it's part of a performance art piece by Chinese artist Han Bing that was unveiled at the Beijing music festival - and Bing has been walking produce on leashes for more than a decade. The Wall Street Journal tracked down Bing after the 'trend' story about the 'cabbage patch kids' walking salads around Beijing was so badly bungled by Western news outlets. Bing explains he has been working with produce, as well as other inanimate objects, since 2000. Performance: The latest installment of the 'performance art' was unveiled at the Midi Music Festival in Beijing . 'Originally, I intended for walking the cabbage to have no meaning,' Bing said. 'I was . only trying to encourage freedom, and to get people to question their . daily activities. There’s a knot in everyone’s head, and I want to untie . that knot. A lot of people come up to me asking what I’m trying to . accomplish, but when I’m walking my cabbage, I don’t want to talk. Just . doing what I’m doing is enough.' Bing has created an entire photo series called 'Walking the Cabbage' that includes photos of him and his cabbages all over the world. The website culturetrip.com describes Bing's project as such: 'From Ginza to Times Square, from Tiananmen to Champs-Elysées, Han Bing and his cabbage have traveled the world.' Bing: 'Artist' Han Bing has been walking produce and other inanimate objects around the world since 2000 . Upon discovering that cabbage walking was neither new, nor a 'trend,' the Huffington Post ran a correction to its original story written by blogger Hilary Hanson. 'It’s unclear whether the teens really saw some therapeutic benefit to the cabbage walking, or they were just messing with reporters,' the correction states.","Western media outlets reported that Beijing's 'cabbage patch kids' were part of a new trend .

"By . Amanda Williams . A rare dinosaur fossil is believed to have been smuggled into Britain, it has today been revealed. The American authorities have launched a hunt for a fully intact Tarbosaurus fossil in the UK after a Florida fossil dealer pleaded guilty to running an international dinosaur smuggling operation, with Britain at its centre. Eric Prokopi faces up to 17 years in prison after he admitted illegally importing 'multiple containers of dinosaurs' from the Mongolia via the UK. Prokopi of Gainesville, 38, . stole the skeletal remains of dinosaurs - including a . nearly complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar, a relative of the . Tyrannosaurus rex - from Mongolia and China. The American authorities have launched a hunt for a fully intact Tarbosaurus fossil in the UK after a Florida fossil dealer pleaded guilty to running an international dinosaur smuggling operation (stock image) Prokopi of Gainesville, 38, stole the skeletal remains of dinosaurs,including a nearly complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar, a relative of the Tyrannosaurus rex, from Mongolia and China . It also included a Tarbosaurus - a close relative of the Tyrannosaurus Rex and was found in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. It is one of six sets of dinosaur fossils that Prokopi has agreed to forfeit so they can be returned to Mongolia. A source told The Independent: 'This particular fossil is not currently in the custody of British law enforcement. Its exact whereabouts is being established but we would like to see it in safe custody soon. At present, someone's dinosaur is indeed missing.' The hunt for the fossil follows an investigation into a global trade in dinosaur bones  which ranged from a New York auction to a prominent British fossil dealer on Dorset's world-renowned Jurassic Coast. The Independent said a fossil shop owner in Charmouth, sent a consignment of fossils to Mr Prokopi in 2010 along with paperwork passed to detectives investigating the illegal sale of another Tarbosaurus. The near-intact skeleton was put up for sale by Mr Prokopi last May at a Manhattan auction and fetched $1.1m (£680,000). But the deal was halted after Mongolian President, Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, said that the fossil was rightfully owned by his country. Under Mongolian law, all fossils remain state property  - their sale abroad is forbidden without a permit which was not obtained by Prokopi. Jurassic crime: Prokopi caught the attention of federal . officials when he sold the skeleton of this Tyrannosaurus bataar, which was native to what is now Mongolia, to a . Manhattan buyer for $1.1 million . Forged: . Prokopi smuggled the fossils from Mongolia but . claimed on U.S. customs forms that they were 'broken bones' belonging to lizards and other reptiles that were imported from the . UK, according to federal officials . Convicted: Mr Prokopi outside Manhattan Federal Court in New York. He faces up to 17 years in jail when he is sentenced in April . Stolen: A number of smuggled dinosaur fossils were taken from Prokopi's home in Gainesville . Seized: Mongolia does not permit the removal of dinosaur bones from its territory . Arrest: US Attorney Preet Bharara referred to Prokopi as a 'one-man black market in prehistoric fossils' A criminal investigation was launched . by the Department for Homeland Security and last week Prokopi admitted . three charges, including the falsification of customs forms and . complicity in fraud. In a statement to a New York court . last week, Mr Prokopi said he had asked for the labels on the relics he . bought to be deliberately 'vague and misleading so that they didn't . bring attention to the shipment'. In the formal legal complaint brought . against Mr Prokopi, investigators said they had been given paperwork by . Heritage Auctions relating to the sale of the 7.3m-long Tarbosaurus . skeleton which included a 'commercial invoice' from the Dorset fossil . shop owner, who is not accused of any wrong doing, and a customs . declaration which stated the dinosaur fossil had been imported from . Britain. Scotland Yard confirmed that its art . and antiques unit had been contacted by the US Department of Justice but . said it was not currently investigating the case. dinosaur fossils . originating from Mongolia. A lawyer representing Mr Prokopi said his client was co-operating with American investigators as part of his plea deal. He faces up to 17 years imprisonment when he is sentenced in April. Transforming the specimens 'into an . impressive skeleton took thousands of hours and every penny my wife and I . had, but it was fascinating,' Prokopi said earlier this year. 'We . were thrilled and couldn't wait to share him with the world, and hoped . it would inspire others to see the magic of paleontology and develop a . love of science and appreciation of nature,' Prokopi said. At the time of his arrest, Prokopi owned a business in Florida . called 'Everything Earth,' which formerly went by the name of 'Florida . Fossils.' He has a wife and two children. Discovered: Homeland Security agents seized stolen bones from a warehouse near Prokopi's home in Gainesville, Florida . Historic find: The Tyrannosaurus bataar, also known as the Tarbosaurus, was native to Mongolia and lived nearly 70 million years ago . Valuable: Dinosaur bones - such as those smuggled into the US by Prokopi (pictured) - have become big business as demand from collectors grows around the world . The international trade in dinosaur fossils is now a multimillion dollar industry, with collectors prepared to pay huge prices for the most sought-after specimens. Museums and other conservationists want science to come first, but for many of those involved in sourcing fossils today the lure of the mighty dollar appears to be winning out. Many countries have strict regulations on the sale of fossils - and those caught doing so illegally face stiff penalties. A recent case in the US saw renowned dinosaur hunter Nathan Murphy sentenced to three years on probation for stealing 13 dinosaur bones from central Montana's Hell Creek badlands in 2006. He pleaded guilty to theft of government property. Mr Murphy had risen to fame after discovering one of the world's best-preserved brachylophosaurus dinosaur fossils in 2000. The theft of fossils is not a new thing however. In the 19th Century the great 'Bone Wars' were marked by a rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to out do the other, including bribery, theft, and even the destruction of bones. The pair searched for fossils in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming, with both using their wealth to finance large scale expeditions between 1877 and189.","Eric Prokopi smuggled dinosaur bones into US pretending they were from lizards 'and other reptiles'

"By . Becky Evans . The Governor of the Bank of England has advised a businessman who was refused a loan to try borrowing from a Swedish bank instead. Mike Benson was so 'incensed' when the Bank of Scotland refused to lend him £10,000 for a new transit van for his successful business he wrote to Sir Mervyn King to demand an explanation. In an apparent acknowledgement of the failure of British banks to lend to small businesses, Sir Mervyn suggested Mr Benson approach the Swedish Handelsbanken. Mike Benson said it was a 'damning indictment' of the state of British banks in the UK . Sir Mervyn, who wrote and signed the letter, pictured, suggested Mr Benson try Swedish bank Handelsbanken as he had been refused by the Bank of Scotland, which is part-owned by the taxpayer . Mr Benson, who was refused a £10,000 loan, praised Sir Mervyn King for his response . Sir Mervyn, who is being replaced by Canadian Mark Carney in July, said he understood 'how maddening' such decisions are. In the letter, he wrote: 'I was sorry to read of the difficulty you have had in trying to replace your transit van. 'I can fully understand how maddening that, and the behaviour you describe from the banks you have spoken to, must have been.' Latest figures show that lending to businesses has continued to fall. Data . from the Bank of England shows that lending to businesses and . individuals in the final quarter of last year dropped by £2.4billion. Mr Benson’s firm, which supplies . air compressors across the world, has been in profit for the last 15 . years and has customers as far afield as the US and Chile. Bank . of Scotland refused Mr Benson a loan arguing his business did not have . sufficient 'fixed assets' - items that can be sold if a loan goes wrong - . to act as security. Mr Benson, 65, who runs air compressor export firm Airwave International in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said he was shocked that Sir Mervyn had responded to his letter personally. The father-of-two said: 'Sir Mervyn King’s letter was absolutely delightful. 'He was obviously quite cross that the banks were not lending money to profitable businesses. Sir Mervyn, who is leaving his role as Governor of the Bank of England, pictured, in July, said the Government could ask publically-owned banks 'to lend more' to businesses . 'I . have to say his response for me to try a Swedish bank was quite . staggering and a damning indictment of the way British banks deal with . businesses in this country. 'In many ways, I do think, well good on him because he was being totally honest and bully for him.' Mr Benson was especially angry with the Bank of Scotland because instead of being granted the loan, he was offered a free 'counselling' service and the use of a free business mentor to help him grow his business. He said: 'I thought that was sweet and patronising. To offer counselling to someone who has been in business for this long, and at my age.' The Bank of Scotland, which is part owned by the taxpayer, said he did not have the assets to secure the loan . A bank spokesman said: 'On a case by case basis, there can be circumstances when we ask for security for a loan through a personal guarantee and we do our best to make this clear to our customers.' The British Bankers Association reported a fall of nearly £300million in lending to four million small and medium-sized businesses at the end of last year. Two government-backed schemes, Project Merlin and Funding for Lending (FLS) have apparently had little effect on business lending so far. Mr Benson remarked: 'Merlin was supposed to be a magician, but there’s certainly no magic about what the banks have been doing. 'There will come a point when we don’t need the banks. And sayonara to the banks.' Mike Benson did not take Sir Mervyn’s advice and is now looking into buying the van from his own funds. The Bank of England has confirmed the letter Sir Mervyn King wrote to Mike Benson was genuine. A spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on the contents of the letter, it was a private letter sent by Sir Mervyn to Mr Benson which has somehow found its way into the public domain. 'I would draw your attention to the fact that Sir Mervyn was suggesting other lenders to Mr Benson when he gave the name of the Swedish bank, it was not a recommendation.' The letter, pictured,  from Sir Mervyn has been confirmed as genuine by the Bank of England . Dear Mr Benson. Thank you for your letter of 9 January. I appreciate you taking the time to outline your recent experience. I was sorry to read of the difficulty you have had in trying to replace your transit van. I can fully understand how maddening that, and the behaviour you describe from the banks you have spoken to, must have been. Your experience is common to that of many of the companies across the UK that I have visited recently. Accessing credit appears to have . been most testing for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), for which . bank lending is a particularly important source of finance. Unlike SMEs, large companies can . generally resort to alternative sources of funding, for example by going . directly to the main capital markets - which can act as a ‘safety . valve’ when bank lending is impaired. There are a number of policies that could help. The Government could ask the . publicly-owned banks to lend more to SMEs or guarantee bank lending to . SMEs, or encourage new banks, that have more capacity to meet the . borrowing needs of SMEs, to enter the market. The Bank of England cannot take . decisions such as these - which sectors should receive credit and on . what terms, are political and rightly for elected officials. Nevertheless, I hope that our . Funding for Lending Scheme, which is providing funding to banks at rates . linked to their performance in sustaining or expanding their lending to . the UK non-financial sector, might provide some relief to all types of . borrowers, including SMEs. More generally, I would encourage people who have had problems with their bank to try new lenders. One such example is . Handelsbanken, a long-established, but relatively new to the UK, Swedish . bank, which has grown rapidly in the past few years.” Yours sincerely, Mervyn King.","Governor of Bank of England replied personally to Mike Benson who was refused a £10,000 loan by the Bank of Scotland for a transit van .

"By . Sam Webb . The Prime Minister's grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Malcolm Mount, was wounded at D-Day in Normandy. Today Cameron paid tribute to those who took part in the landings . Prime Minister David Cameron has paid tribute to the 'men and women of D-Day' including his own grandfather during a banquet for war veterans at St Paul's Cathedral. The event was part of the BBC's Great British Menu show which saw a succession of chefs challenged to create a menu fit for heroes inspired by the Second World War. The Prime Minister's grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Malcolm Mount, was commissioned in the 99th (Bucks and Berks Yeomanry), a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, in 1924 and over the years rose to the rank of major. Mount transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps in 1941 and soon after was made Lieutenant-Colonel. He was wounded at D-Day in Normandy. The show, which has already been filmed, ended with the winning menu served to guests including Winston Churchill's granddaughter Celia Sandys and will be broadcast next Friday. Other specially invited guests include several D-Day veterans and Conservative peer Baroness Trumpington who worked as a cypher clerk at Bletchley Park. Mr Cameron told them he could not imagine 'what it must have been like to land on those beaches - to uncertainty, to terrifying danger, to possible death'. He said: 'But that is exactly what thousands of young men did. 'One of them was my grandfather. He landed on the Normandy beaches and was wounded just a few days later. I'm so proud of what he did and let me tell you I'm so proud to be in the presence of so many D-Day veterans today.' Sir William Mount in 1966 (left) and in 1932 (right). He died in 1993 . The Prime Minister also praised the heroes 'on the home front' who made 'a vital contribution to the war effort'. He said: 'My generation, this country, we enjoy freedom. We enjoy democracy because of the sacrifices your generation made and we must never, ever forget that. 'Everyone, raise your glasses to the men and women of D-Day.'

"By . Harriet Arkell . An ostrich-sized bird that is capable of disembowelling a human with its claws has been spotted on the loose in the English countryside. The South American rhea, which stands six feet tall and can run at 40mph, has been on the run since it fled its home in Hertfordshire a month ago. The giant flightless bird, which has six-inch claws and could kill with a single blow, was photographed first by cyclist Ray Murdoch, north east of Stevenage, Hertfordshire. A runaway rhea that fled its Hertfordshire home four weeks ago was spotted in a field at Ansety on Sunday . Really hard to spot: The six-foot bird has been on the run for a month. They are also incredibly hard to catch because of their fast speeds . Where am I?  Cyclist Tim Bradshaw took these pictures with his camera after seeing the bird at the weekend . Runaway rhea's route: Bird escaped from Brent Pelham and has since visited Brent Pelham and Anstey . Mr Murdoch, a retired geography teacher, saw the runaway bird near the village of Nuthampstead on Thursday. He said: 'In the distance I saw what appeared to be a large bird, and the closer I got the more perplexed I got. 'Initially, I thought it was a crane, but as I got closer, I realised it wasn't a crane, and I wondered if it was an emu. 'The bird was trotting along just a couple of metres off the road in the edge of a field, and as I got closer it kept looking over its shoulder at me. 'I think the rhea was as amazed to see a cyclist as I was to see a rhea.' By the time Mr Murdoch had pulled out his phone to take a picture, the bird had trotted 40 or 50 metres into the field. He said: 'You can see the bird standing in a couple of the shots, in the others it was grubbing around in the rape field for food, or perhaps it was trying to bury its head in the sand. Big bird: The runaway rhea was also photographed near Brent Pelham on Thursday by cyclist Ray Murdoch . Mr Murdoch took these two pictures with his mobile phone after the bird trotted off into a field of oil seed rape . 'It was about six feet high with its head up.' On Sunday, civil engineer Tim Bradshaw, 37, saw the bird in a field near the village of Anstey where he lives. He said: 'We had heard it was living in the woods near our house so I got my camera - it seemed more scared of me than I was of it. Jo Clarke, the bird's owner, who said she keeps four rheas on her land at Brent Pelham as they are good at eating weeds, said: 'The bird escaped after being spooked by the local hunt.' But she said she had no idea how to recapture it as rheas can run at 40mph, Anglia news reported. Di Pyper, master of the Puckeridge . Hunt which has its hunt kennels at Brent Pelham, told MailOnline that . members of the hunt had seen the rhea trotting away when they hunted a . trail through a field near the bird's home. She . said: 'We weren't very near it and the hounds didn't go anywhere near . it but some people told me they'd seen what they thought was an ostrich . trotting through a field. 'I . saw the bird the next day when it came past my house and I told the . owner, as did several other people who sighted it, but I'm not sure . anything was done.' Giles . Cooper, Hertfordshire police spokesman, said three sightings had been . reported to police, the most recent of which was Anstey on Sunday. The rhea's owner said it was spooked by the hunt, but Puckeridge hunt master Di Pyper said the hounds didn't go near its field . He said capturing the animal was the owner's responsibility but said the police would help if it posed a danger to the public. A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said it was urging anyone who spots the bird to get in contact with them, while a bird expert warned the public to keep away. He said: 'They look nice but they are so strong it's unbelievable.  They aren't listed as a dangerous animal but can kill you with one strike of their feet because their claws are six inches long. 'They will also go for your eyes with their beak.' Flightless but strong: Rheas are native to South America and can live up to 40 years . The Common Rhea, also known as Rhea Americana or 'Nandu' is native to South American and often called the South American ostrich. In the wild, they live in the pampas regions where it is hot in summer and very cold in winter, which means they are ideally suited to the changeable British climate. They can grow up to six feet tall and weigh up to four stone, with the males being larger than the females.  They are omnivores but mainly eat insects, shoots, leaves and grasses. Rheas have six-inch claws on their feet and large wings that are used in courtship, mating and aggressive displays.  Male birds can bite or knock out a person with one blow from their claws, while female rheas are unlikely to be aggressive. In South America, rheas, which can live for up to 40 years are farmed for their meat, while in the UK they are increasingly popular as pets.","Rhea escaped from home in Brent Pelham, Hertfordshire, four weeks ago .

"By . Daniel Mills . A six-month-old Darwin baby born with a major heart defect has been denied life saving surgery at a Melbourne hospital, and now her mother wants to know why. Sandra Pastrikos is facing an uphill battle in the fight to keep her daughter, Doreen Pastrikos alive after she was prevented from having the life-saving operation at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital because of a severe change in her condition back in February. Her daughter was initially scheduled to be flown to Melbourne three months ago, but was prevented from traveling because she suffered a 'tet spell' which is brought about by a dramatic drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. Denied proper care: Sandra Pastrikos said her daughter was prevented from having heart surgery at Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital due to an improper duty of care in Darwin . Now her mother has squared the blame on Royal Darwin Hospital clinicians for failing to provide a proper duty of care, which lead to her daughter 'going blue in the face.' She wants to know the exact circumstances which lead her to have the 'tet spell', and has demanded an inquiry be undertaken at RDH to investigate exactly why she was moved from the RDH children's ward to the intensive care unit. She claims she wasn't told about her daughter's change in condition straight away, and the fact she had been relocated to the ICU while waiting for her daughter to arrive in Melbourne. Doreen suffered a severe 'tet spell' and was moved into ICU without her mother having any knowledge of her condition . She told the NT news: 'I don’t believe she was being watched and we want an internal investigation into the circumstances.' 'I have always been able to control her tet spells very quickly. I want to know if my baby was being monitored properly while I was away from her that led her to have an episode so severe that it has now destroyed her last chance at life.' But in an email statement, seen by the NT news, the director of medical services at RDH Dr Sara Watson said: “We can confirm that the patient (Doreen) is being treated appropriately under the care of local senior specialists in conjunction with interstate specialists.” Ms Watson also told MailOnline: ""This is a sad and complex case and our thoughts are with the parents and family. There have been multiple independent interstate clinical opinions received, regarding the safety of performing cardiac surgery for the patient.” It has been a tiring an emotional three months for Mrs Pastrikos who has been spending 24-hours-a-day by her daughter's hospital cot. Not only does she have her daughter's illness to contend with, but she is also a mother to seven other children two of which are under the age of seven. In what looked like a positive sign of hope for the family, doctors from Brisbane's Mater Hospital had come forward with an offer to perform the surgery just three weeks ago, but that has since lapsed because of a high chance it could leave the six-month-old with brain damage. Mrs Pastrikos said she has been left to feel like her daughter's life is worthless, and still doesn't know if her daughter will be given the life-saving surgery she needs. '(We are) being made to feel that more or less she does not have the right to live.' 'She is in dire and desperate need of the surgery and if she doesn't we know she will die,' she said. The family is now appealing for an independent pediatric specialist to examine Doreen following the family's allegations surrounding her treatment.","Sandra Pastrikos daughter Doreen born with congenital heart defect .

"By . Belinda Robinson . Every couple needs a place to raise a family and these two geese have found their home sweet home in an unlikely location - a supermarket car park. The geese return to exactly the same spot - Sainsbury's in Cheadle, Stockport - every year to lay their eggs in a corner near the petrol station. It is thought they choose the spot because it is near where a pond used to be in the corner of the car park. The feathered family are now treated as VIP guests by staff, who have become rather fond of the local celebrities. Home sweet home: Canada Geese waddle along in the car park of Sainsbury's in Cheadle, the unlikely surroundings they call home . I'll sit here: The geese are most often seen first thing in the morning, and it is thought they were attracted to the site because a pond used to be on the same industrial estate . Location: This map shows where the geese return to each year, they are thought to like the site because the . Sainsbury's car park and petrol station are near to where the pond used to be on the upper left . They now cordon off the area when they arrive so the birds can nest undisturbed. David Gaffin, manager of the Wilmslow Road store, said: 'I know they have been coming as long as I've worked here over the last three and-a-half years. 'The mother lays her eggs in the car park and the father stands by, guarding her like a proud parent. It's very cute.' Although geese can be aggressive when protecting their young, staff and customers have never encountered any bad behaviour from the couple, apart from the occasional hiss. Mr Gaffin said: 'They have found somewhere they like to come and nest and they must feel quite secure here. Of all the places they could go, and they choose a supermarket car park. 'Our customers are always putting pictures of them on Twitter and Facebook. 'They are like local celebrities now. The geese are most often seen first thing in the morning, and it is thought they were attracted to the site because of the pond which used to be on the same industrial estate. The pair usually stick around for about four to five weeks before flying off. Just the two of us: Both Canada Geese make themselves comfortable with their surroundings . Mr Gaffin said staff were always sorry to see them leave and looked forward to them returning the following year. He said: 'They're like part of the family now here in Cheadle.' Canada geese are devoted parents and never leave their goslings unguarded - which is perhaps why staff have never spotted any of their babies. They tend to return to the same breeding site year after year and often mate for life with the same partner. They have even been known to die of sadness if they lose their mate. The species was introduced to the UK from North America in the seventeenth century. Their permanent population is estimated at 90,000, with more migrating in winter.

"By . Louise Boyle . and Associated Press . Although hole-in-the wall Chinese restaurant Sam Wo was known for its curry noodles among loyal patrons, it was their surly waiter who people really came to see. The small diner of just eight tables became a cultural mainstay in the . 1970s through reports by the late San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb . Caen and the Tales of the City novels of Armistead Maupin. Both men immortalized the restaurant by . writing about the antics of Edsel Ford Fung, the waiter who was known . for verbally abusing patrons and slamming dishes on tables. Edsel Ford Fung, pictured with the customers he loved to hate and abused mercilessly, at Sam Wo restaurant in 1982. The San Francisco institution closed its doors in 2012 . Sam Wo has been immortalized in San Francisco literature along with its grumpy waiter Edsel Ford Fung. The restaurant closed its doors in 2012 . 'The Soup Nazi is the Dalai Lama compared . to Edsel Ford Fung,' said longtime patron Sam Begler, as he tucked into . pork rolls and chow mein, the Associated Press reported when the restaurant closed its doors in 2012. 'He is the Don Rickles of restaurants.' Diners of decades past fondly remembered that Mr Fung, who was born and raised in San Francisco's Chinatown, would verbally abuse patrons, slam down dishes, and chastise complainers. Contrary to Mr Fung's legendary temper, the name of the restaurant actually means 'three in peace'. The star waiter died in 1984  at age 57, but for a long . time a sign listing the restaurant's house rules  maintained his gruff . demeanor. As head waiter, he would tell customers, who would often queue around the block for a table, to 'sit down and shut up'. Among its warnings: 'No Booze ... No Jive, No  Coffee, Milk, . Soft Drinks, Fortune Cookies.' Fung would refuse to serve . people  he didn't like the looks of and chastise customers who dared to . complain when  they were brought the wrong dishes. Diners who took too long reading the menu were asked: 'What is this, a library?', Priceconomics reported this week. Ordering the wrong thing was also a . problem. A customer who repeatedly, over several decades, tried to get a . plate of fried shrimp was told 'No! It's a rip-off!' Other . unsuspecting diners were forced to take on elements of Mr Fung's job . description, including cleaning plates, bringing water to other 'guests' and totting up the bills. Edsel Ford Fong food stand at the San Francisco Giants¿ AT&T Park where the service is a vast improvement on its namesake . After earning your seat this way, if a regular came in - then you were often up-ended out of your chair. The only times that Mr Fung cheered up was when he took part in politically-incorrect 'flirtation'. Often he would grope female customers and told one outraged patron that his teenage daughter had 'nice little apples'. It was never quite . clear whether his  crustiness was genuine or an act, but it was always . an experience, especially  for locals who wandered in to take advantage . of the restaurant's 3am closing  time. 'I know change is good, but . sometimes you want to hold onto the happy memories,' said customer . Darlene Lee at the time, 71, who had been coming to the restaurant for 60 years and . said its inexpensive fare was comfort food that reminded her of going . home. The restaurant closed in 2012 after David Ho, a descendent of one of the restaurant's original owners, decided to shut down after officials demanded extensive health and safety upgrades. The legendary waiter is remembered fondly by veteran city dwellers every time they pass Gold Mountain - a mural depicting the city's defining traits.

"By . Kate Lyons . Australian roundabouts are among the most dangerous in the Western world because they are designed for capacity and not safety, a new study has shown. The report, which was released by Austroads last week, found that the design of Australian roundabouts encouraged drivers to speed through intersections and to ‘look but not see’ other motorists. Australian roundabouts are built according to a tangential design, which means that the driver has very good visibility as they approach the roundabout and is less likely to slow down, or check the roundabout closely as they approach the intersection. The Britannia roundabout in Adelaide (pictured) is one of the nation's most dangerous, between 2009 and 2013 there were 291 crashes at the roundabout . The researchers suggested that the ideal speed at which motorists should travel through a roundabout is 25 km/hr, but with the current Australian tangential design, many motorists do not slow down as they approach the roundabout and regularly go through at speeds in excess of 40 km/hr. Australian roundabouts differ from those built in the UK and Europe, which employ a ‘radial’ design that deliberately aims to reduce visibility. These roundabouts are designed to force drivers to reduce their speed as they approach the roundabout, giving them enough time to scan for other motorists and cyclists before entering the roundabout. Cyclists were particularly at risk on Australian roundabouts. In Victoria, one in 10 accidents involving a bike occurs at a roundabout, reported the study. This figure gets worse in cities, with almost half of all roundabout crashes in inner city Melbourne between 2004 and 2009 involving cyclists. Almost half of all accidents at roundabouts in inner-city Melbourne (pictured) involve cyclists . European roundabouts employ a radial design (left) rather than the tangential design (right) used on Australian roundabouts. The tangential design allows for too much visibility and encourages drivers to speed through the roundabout . In Queensland, 15 percent of all bicycle crashes at intersections occurred at roundabouts, despite roundabouts accounting for only four percent of intersections. One of Australia's worst roundabouts was the Britannia roundabout in Adelaide. Between 2009 and 2013 there were 291 crashes at that roundabout, though the average has dropped since September 2013 when the roundabout was upgraded. The research also found that attempts to improve the safety of cyclists might actually be making conditions more dangerous for them. Bicycle lanes, for instance, may make a roundabout feel bike-friendly, but actually increase the risk of crashes by positioning bicyclists away from the middle of lanes where motorists look. Bike lanes also make cyclists more vulnerable to sideswipe accidents and those caused when drivers of parked cars open their car doors in front of cyclists without looking.","Australian roundabouts are more dangerous than those in the rest of the English-speaking world .

"By . Sally Lee . A teenage girl was indecently assaulted when two police impersonators stopped and searched her while she was walking to school in Sydney. The schoolgirl saw the man and the woman, both dressed in blue clothes, emerge from a station wagon on a road in Quakers Hill on Monday at about 10.40am. Their vehicle had the word 'police' written on the side. The Wyndham College student was then searched separately by the pair, believed to be in their 30s, where she alleges that the woman indecently assaulted her during the process. A teenage girl was indecently assaulted when two police impersonators stopped and searched her while she was walking to school in Quakers Hill on Monday . Police said when the man asked to search the Wyndham College student, he retrieved a German shepherd from the back of the vehicle to assist him. However the two didn't steal any of the girl's property. Police said the girl went home and told her father, who then informed police. Officers believe the incident could have been a one-off 'prank'. 'Every now and then do you hear of people doing these things. It's not often they got to this extent dressed in blues and with a dog,' Quaker's Hill police duty officer, Inspector Steve Gallagher told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'There's still some chance it may have been a bit of a prank. That's one possibility that lessens the risk to the public if that's all that it was.' The man is described as 180cm tall with short dark hair and olive skin while the woman is 160cm tall with brown hair in a pony tail. Both were wearing light blue shirts, dark blue cargo pants and black footwear. The teenager was walking along Douglas Road at about 10.40am when she saw a man and woman, both dressed in blue, emerge from a white station wagon with 'police' written on the side . In a separate incident, two men robbed a Mount Annan house - Sydney's south west - after pretending to be detectives and showing residents a fake police badge. Police said a 66-year-old woman was washing up in her kitchen when she heard someone bang on the front door, ring the bell and call out 'police' about 11.30pm on May 19. The girl was on her way to Wyndham College in Quakers Hill . She opened the door to two men who flashed a fake police badge and claimed to be police officers who said they needed to execute a search warrant. Two men, aged 40 and 68, who were also inside the house at the time were woken as the house was searched by the intruders. Police will allege that they stole cash and jewellery, who then said they would send a receipt for the items. The pair then searched two vehicles in the garage before walking from the home on Welling Drive and turning left into Persoonia Close. The two men are described as being of Caucasian appearance and having a slim build. The first man was 180cm tall while the second man was 165cm tall. Both wore blue pants and blue shirts that may have had a logo. Investigators are examining links between the incident and a similar offence that occurred in the early hours of the following morning. However Inspector Gallagher said there are no links between these police impersonations and the indecent assault of the school girl on Monday. Anyone with information about the man or woman or the white station wagon they were driving should contact police. The maximum penalty for a person who impersonates a police officer and pretends to exercise a power or function as an officer is seven years imprisonment.","The 17-year-old girl was approached by a man and woman dressed in blue as she was walking to school on Douglas Road, Quakers Hill on Monday .

What she found was the most popular carriers, such as Delta and United, had the costliest extras. Don't forget the add-ons: Business Insider conducted a report into the cheapest airline to fly from New York to Los Angeles on Fourth of July weekend in terms of overall fees, and determined SouthWest offered the best price . The report found that JetBlue and Southwest Airlines did not charge customers to check in one item of luggage. However American Airlines, Delta and United all charged $25 to check a bag. Picking a seat is also an important and expensive option. SouthWest determines their seating arrangements on the order that people check in, but for $12.50 you can reserve a spot toward the front of the plane. JetBlue offer more spacious seats for $80. United has economy plus for $99, while Delta has economy comfort for $99. American Airlines has the fewest available complimentary seats. Upgraded seats cost between $66 and $86. SouthWest Airlines charged the least amount of additional fees overall, Business Insider concluded . The cost for a good seat and a checked seat one-way on Delta and/or United is almost $250. Silverstein determined that SouthWest were the best all-inclusive option. However that is without being able to choose a seat. Delta and United were the most expensive for Fourth of July when it came to additional fees.","Study conducted by Business Insider into the cheapest overall airline for Fourth of July Weekend .

"By . Sara Malm . Murdered: Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, was killed during a car-jacking in September 2011 . A successful businessman bled to death in a quiet residential street after he was stabbed by a car thief trying to steal his beloved Mercedes. Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, was sat in his parked car in Ilford, Essex, with a female friend when he was attacked in September, 2011. Mr Bhurji, known as Raj, was stabbed in the heart after he refused to hand over the keys to his Mercedes SLK, a court heard today. Two young men, aged 23 and 21, appeared in court today charged with his murder. The assailant approached the car shortly after midnight on September 13, 2011 and after dragging Mr Bhurji’s female friend out of the passenger seat, demanded the keys to the Mercedes, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Bhurji, from Ilford, who ran his own garage, told the carjacker he did not have the keys and threw them behind the driver’s seat, the court heard. In response, the knifeman stabbed Mr Bhurji in the heart, but before he collapsed, he was able to reach for the keys and hand them over to the thief. The Mercedes was driven off ‘at speed’ leaving Mr Bhurji dying by the road, the court heard. He and his female friend both had their phones in the car, and by the time a resident had called an ambulance, it was too late and Mr Bhurji was declared dead at the scene. The car was fitted with a tracking device and was found later parked neatly near Epping Forest, the court was told. Mr Bhurji’s iPhone was gone. Prosecutor Sally O’Neill QC said: ‘Mr Bhurji made the mistake of protesting against his car being taken.’ Brutal: Mr Bhurji, a successful garage owner, was parked on this quiet residential road in Ilford, Essex when he was killed as two men allegedly tried to steal his car . Pride: Mr Bhurji refused to hand over the keys to his Mercedes SKL, and was stabbed in the heart and bled to death in the 2011 attack . Denying: Andre Campbell, 23, is accused of selling Mr Bhurji's iPhone for £100 . She said the knifeman was defendant Rory Gordon, 23, of east London, working in a ‘joint enterprise’ with his friend Jae’Don Fearon, 21, from Chingford, Essex. ‘It matters not that Fearon was not the one who stabbed Mr Bhurji and was not at the scene - they were in it together and are both guilty of murder.’ CCTV footage and mobile phone data put the pair at the scene of the murder, she said. Gordon . drove there in a black Corsa and left in the Mercedes. Fearon then . picked him up in the Corsa after the stolen car was left to see if it . would be found by police, the court heard. The . prosecutor said Gordon and Fearon decided to carry out the carjacking . together with ‘the use of a knife and if necessary the actual use of the . knife to do so’. She told the jury: ‘If you are sure they were in it together, they will both be guilty of murder.’ Gordon’s friend Andre Campbell, 23, later sold Mr Bhurji’s iPhone for £100, the prosecutor said. The phone was later recovered by officers investigating the murder. Gordon and Fearon deny murder. Campbell of Chingford, Essex, denies a charge of handling stolen goods. The trial continues.

"By . Mia De Graaf . The Queen has arrived at this year's Chelsea Flower Show with Princess Beatrice for a first glimpse before it opens to the public tomorrow. Guided through the opulent displays at the annual horticulture show, the monarch smiled gleefully and enquired about the intricate creations. Jerry Hall, Kirstie Allsopp, and Twiggy also dropped by the exhibition, which this year marks the First World War centenary in many of the shows. But gardeners faced a battle to stop their blooms from wilting ahead of Her Majesty's arrival as temperature's soared above 25C. Scroll down to see video .

This year, themes range from fashion to warfare; from star-gazing to different cultures; from myths to farming. Her Majesty beamed as she was handed a traditional Thai decoration by the designers of a 100,000-flower display inspired by Thailand. Accompanied by her granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, the monarch wore a lilac jacket and green dress without a hat, having missed the scorching weather. Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch brought his mother Wanda Ventham, 78, as his companion for the day - and she was inundated by breathless fans demanding details about his upbringing. Cumberbatch, 37, who wore a pink shirt, light grey jacket and sunglasses was not keen to discuss his horticultural skills. But his mother, who plays Sherlock's mother in the BBC series, answered on his behalf, telling fans he likes to grow plants on his roof terrace. The show gardens include a number of war-themed displays - which were opened with memorial readings by celebrities.

World War poets who died during the conflict, on the No Man's Land ABF . The Soldiers' Charity garden. The garden represents a landscape . marked by the fighting in northern France, including trenches, a mine . crater pond and the yew trees found in war cemeteries. Designer Charlotte Rowe said she was . inspired by her own family's involvement in the First World War, . including her grandfather, a second lieutenant with the Middlesex . Regiment. She said: 'The idea behind it is that . the land, No Man's Land, was fought over again and again with the front . line moving very little, and the land got completely messed up and . churned up. As they entered the showroom where many celebrities bought plants to take home, the Queen was introduced to some of the women running stalls . 'The concept is the healing of the land after severe conflict, and relating it to the human body and spirit.' Plants used in the garden have been . grown by injured soldiers at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre . at Headley Court as part of horticultural therapy. The . war in Afghanistan inspired first-time Chelsea designer Matthew . Keightley to design the Hope on the Horizon garden for Help For . Heroes,which charts the path to recovery for wounded personnel. Mr . Keightley's brother Michael serves with the RAF Regiment and is on his . fifth tour of Afghanistan. On his last tour, he formed part of a medical . evacuation crew, which led the designer to explore the recovery . process.

The garden will be used to help service personnel at one of Help For Heroes recovery centres after Chelsea ends. The . scorching weekend had not been a problem for the garden, he said, as it . had been designed for sunny weather - but he would be getting in to . water it as soon as the judges had been round. Many took to covering plants, particularly peonies and irises, in muslin to keep off the rays. Others tied up their flowers and watered them repeatedly to stop them opening too early. The baking temperatures left gardeners at the London show – which opens this week – more than a little hot under the collar. Andrew . Wilson, 55, who designed a wine-themed garden costing tens of thousands . of pounds, said: ‘Last year it was freezing and this year it’s too hot. 'My irises have started to go over. I’ll have to substitute some of them with roses.’ VIP preview: Strictly Come Dancing's Brendan Cole (far left) and former .

Jerry Hall and her companion also took to the vikings with a glamourous pose before heading off to explore the plethora of displays . Elizabetta . Clementel, who has designed a garden for Country Life magazine, said . she was worried about whether her Irises would hold out. The 55-year-old, from Spain, added: ‘It’s a bit of a panic but we’ll do our best.’ Many designs . are based on foreign horticulture: a Cleve West creation is inspired by . ancient Persian gardens, and another exhibit looks like an Italian-style . formal garden. Organisers have this year celebrated a wave of new young talent. TV presenter and gardener Dan Pearson picked 'nuturing potential' as the theme for his garden. Having been discouraged from pursuing . a career in horticulture as a youngster, he said he wants to encourage . today's children to stick to their guns. 'The way to attract more young people . into horticultural industries is for these careers to be seen as . valuable and remunerated appropriately,' he urged.

"By . Lillian Radulova . Rebecca Gilchrist did not initially believe the local council worker who called to tell her that her cat had been found 165kms from his home. Rupert, her two-year-old ginger house cat, had gone missing from his west Melbourne home on February 18 after darting out the front door. He is believed to have then taken a two hour train ride to Traralgon, where he was found three months later. Rebecca Gilchrist was reunited with her ginger house cat Rupert on Monday, after he was found 165 kilometres from his West Melbourne home . After months of bombarding her neighbours and local community with missing posters, Ms Gilchrist was contacted by the Latrobe City Council who told her that her cat's microchip had traced them back to her. 'At first, me and my mum were thinking ""no, it can’t be"",' Ms Gilchrist told the MailOnline. 'But then we thought about it and there is just no way that they'd have a ginger cat with a similar enough microchip number to have accidently punched our number.' Ms Gilchrist explained that the normally content cat, which spent most of his time in the house or lazing about in the sun with her Dalmatian Poppy, was not very fond of people. Local councilors from Traralgon, where Rupert was found, believed that he most likely jumped on a slow moving paper mill train which links the two areas . Ms Gilchrist said her Dalmatian Poppy, was ecstatic to have her companion back and kept leading her owners to their local railway tracks while Rupert was missing . Rupert's family was at a loss as to how he managed to get so far from home. The only hint they received was from Poppy their dog, who Ms Gilchrist said kept leading them towards some train tracks near her home. 'Everyone was quite surprised he'd gotten so far. One of the council workers said there was a train line at the end of the road and that’s probably the most likely way he’d gotten there,' she said. 'It's a slow moving paper mill train that goes once a day and stops at most of the stops on the way here.' Rupert was picked up by the council last Tuesday after he was found wandering near the animal rescue centre. Rupert was hand-reared by Ms Gilchrist after she found him dumped in a garbage bin as a kitten. Poppy played a big role in helping to raise the kitten, instantly taking him on as one of her own pups . Since being reunited with his owners, the ginger cat has had an enthusiastic welcoming back from Poppy who was ecstatic to be reunited with her companion. 'As soon as she smelt it was our cat we brought home, she was doing backflips and jumping in circles. she was so excited  and kept trying to clean him,' Ms Gilchrist said.

Rory Gordon, 23, and Jae'Don Fearon, 21, attacked Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, after he refused to hand over the keys to his treasured Mercedes SLK coupe. The attack ended with Mr Bhurji getting stabbed in the heart, and left dying on the side of the road in Ilford, Essex, in the early hours of September 13 2011, as the pair drove off. Rory Gordon, 23, and Jae'Don Fearon, 21, . attacked Harjinder Singh Bhurji, 32, after he refused to hand over the . keys to his treasured Mercedes SLK coupe . Jurors unanimously found Gordon  guilty of murder at the Old Bailey, while Fearon was convicted of his manslaughter after being found not guilty of murder. A third defendant, Andre Campbell, 23, was found guilty of a charge of handling stolen goods after exchanging the victim's iPhone for £100. Adjourning sentencing to May 27, Judge Michael Topolski told Gordon: 'You have been convicted of a brutal murder of a innocent man. 'A brutal murder committed with a knife in the course of a commission of a crime, and all for perhaps £500.' He said he would need to consider what minimum life sentence term to impose, adding: 'That time in circumstances such as these is a very significant one indeed.' The attack ended with Mr Bhurji getting stabbed in the heart, and left dying on the side of the road . The trial had earlier heard that Mr Bhurji was parked in Stoneleigh Road, Ilford, talking to a female friend when the carjackers suddenly struck,. They pulled the woman out of the vehicle and demanded the keys, which Mr Bhurji, who was proud of his car with personalised number plates, said he did not have after throwing them behind the driver's seat. He was stabbed in the heart but was able to lean down to retrieve the keys and hand them over before he collapsed. The Mercedes  - which was fitted with a tracking device - was then driven off 'at speed' leaving Mr Bhurji dying by the road. It was later found parked neatly near Epping Forest.

When Sara Currin woke up May 1 with mild stomach pains, she dismissed it as something minor and went to work as normal. But by 4.30pm, she was holding her new baby in her arms. And the 25-year-old Australian, who has lived in the UK since 2012, had no idea she was even pregnant, let alone at 37 weeks. Surprise: Sarah Currin, pictured with her newborn baby girl Brooke, gave birth at 37 weeks, despite not knowing she was pregnant or having any symptoms . The former Brisbane resident said despite feeling 'a little bit off' in the morning, it was not until about 11am that stomach pains grew strong enough to worry her, The Courier Mail reported. By 1pm the pain was so serve, Ms Currin decided she needed to go home. Fearing the pain was appendicitis, Ms Currin eventually called an ambulance and arrived at hospital by 2.30pm. Two hours later she had given birth to healthy 2.7-kilogram baby girl Brooke. 'I definitely didn’t think I was pregnant, that was for sure. We called the ambulance and I said ""I think I have appendicitis"" and they weren’t sure either,' the new mum said. Surprise: Sarah Currin, pictured with her newborn baby girl Brooke, gave birth at 37 weeks, despite not knowing she was pregnant or having any symptoms . When she arrived at the hospital, Ms Currin was initially told the pain could have been a result of a stomach bug. 'It wasn’t until the midwives were like ""no, feel here"", and said I was fully dilated. They started telling me to push, and I said ""push what? What are you talking about?"",' she said. Ms Currin said she was both shocked and scared at not knowing what was happening. Naming her little girl Brooke, the proud mother said she and partner James could not be happier with their new addition, and that James had taken to fatherhood well. Despite being 37 weeks pregnant at the time of the birth, Ms Currin  said she hadn't noticed any pregnancy symptoms. She says she put on a slight amount of weight, but not enough to make her think she was expecting. 'You just never expect it to happen to you, it’s one of those things you read in the paper,' she said. Obstetrician Dr Paul Bretz, from Arrivals Obstetricians at Woolloongabba in Brisbane, said while Ms Currin's unexpected birth was rare, it was not unheard of. The doctor added that while Brooke's weight was normal for a baby, although on the lower end of the normal range, it would have helped conceal the her in the womb. In more than 20 years of doing obstetrics, Dr Bretz said he had only seen three or four cases where this type of pregnancy had occurred. The doctor said he was aware of a woman in her 40s who attributed a lack of periods to menopause and a woman falling pregnant shortly after giving birth, who believed an absence of periods was due to breast feeding. He said often a pregnancy going undetected was a 'misinterpretation of the symptoms', particularly for those not expecting or wanting to be in that situation.","Australian Sara Currin gave birth at 37 weeks without ever even knowing she was pregnant .

"By . Richard Spillett . Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou had hoped to open the first of his new supermarkets on the ground floor of his latest hotel complex but has been scuppered by local planning chiefs . The founder of easyJet is looking for a new location for his first budget supermarket after plans to open it Croydon, south London were thwarted by council planning bosses. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou wanted to launch his new 'easyFoodstore' chain on the ground floor of his new building, which is also set to become the latest in his easyHotel empire. But the idea was ruled out at an early stage by local planning chiefs, who insisted the building was outside the borough's 'retail zone'. Croydon will instead host a 'mock-up' store which will be used to test the idea on focus groups before it is potentially launched in other less-affluent areas of the capital. Peckham, Woolwich, Catford and Thornton Heath have been mooted as potential locations for the first store, which could open as early as the end of this year if the response is good. A spokesman for easyGroup insisted the plans were still at an early stage and no store was likely to open until the group had seen the response of focus groups to the trial store. EasyGroup, run by Sir Stelios, owns the brand which is now licenced to a range of businesses, including a car hire company, an office space rental firm, a hotel chain and a network of gyms. He remains the largest single shareholder in easyJet, which he founded in 1995. Annoucing his plans to open supermarkets last year, he said: 'I have a feeling that there is a gap in the food retail market – a niche below some of the current budget operators such as Aldi and Lidl.' He said of the store: 'Concentrating on affordable, basic ""no-brand-name"" packet and tinned foods at bargain prices, easyFoodstore underlines the need for additional reliable day-to-day provision of basic foodstuffs.' He then set out his hopes that the former MetLife building the company had taken over in Croydon would combine the brand's hotels, offices, a gym and the first of his supermarkets. The new supermarket was earmarked to open on the ground floor of the converted MetLife building in Croydon (pictured), which is due to be turned into an easyGym, easyHotel and easyOffice . But it emerged today that planners rejected his bid to install the new shop in the area, forcing him to look elsewhere. The news came after Sir Stelios announced plans to list his budget hotel chain on the stock market on Friday. His easyHotel business, which currently runs 20 hotels, wants to raise £60m in the move, the first flotation the tycoon has attempted since his airline floated in 2000. The firm currently runs two hotels it owns, as well as having 17 franchised units. It operates in cities such as London, Dubai, and Johannesburg as well as Sir Stelios's native Cyprus. Sir Stelios said: 'I see easyHotel as one of the best, most natural extensions of the easy brand from the airline. Easyhotel is raising money to accelerate growth at a much faster rate than I could have grown it as a private company.'","Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou had planned to open a trial store in Croydon .

The 46-year-old began receiving treatment last night for the rare disorder, an inflammation of the nerves from the spinal cord, and 'he has already shown a positive response'. In a statement issued by the Hawks on Tuesday, assistant coach Brendon Bolton will take the reins in Clarkson's absence. Hawthorn AFL coach Alastair Clarkson has been diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome after he was hospitalised on Monday night with acute back pain . The coach is 'feeling good and in good spirits', according to tweets from Tuesday's press conference held by the club's CEO Stuart Fox and captain Luke Hodge. The club was in shock with the news but as the condition has been detected early, they're confident that Clarkson will make a full recovery. Although it is unknown how long he will be absent from his coaching duties, Clarkson is expected to remain in hospital for the next week. 'Our best option is to allow him to fully recover. Our first priority is to get his health right. Work isn't a priority,' Fox said. The club were in shock when they were first informed but have been told by medical professionals that the 46-year-old is expected to make a full recovery . Assistant coach Brendon Bolton will be taking over during Clarkson's absence . The father of three was appointed his first senior AFL coaching role at the Hawthorn Football Club in 2005 . 'There will definitely be a lot of support from the boys for him. We're here to support him.' Hodge doesn’t expect Clarkson's absence will disrupt the Hawks' season. Guillain-Barre syndrome syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It causes the immune system to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. Symptoms include a tingly, numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement. Most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have lasting problems.

Jailed: Former Sábado Gigante star Adonis Losada at his sentencing Friday on child porn charges told the judge that he knew what he did was wrong, and that he was going to prison . Reduced: Palm Beach County Circuit Court Judge Karen Miller on Friday sentenced Losada to 10 years in prison on four counts of child pornography after tossing 62 of the 66 counts on which he was being tried . Self-defense: Losada stubbornly refused to used a lawyer in his trial and maintained his own defense. It seems to have paid off as 62 of the charges were dropped . Justice: Adonis Losada, the 49-year-old former comic actor from the popular Spanish-language TV show Sábado Gigante, was tried on 66 counts of child pornography from September 2009 . During his trial, Losada offered no defense and refused to use an attorney in court. He faced a minimum of 47 years and a maximum of 330 years in prison before the majority of the charges were dropped. Losada told Circuit Judge Karen Miller that he understood the serious nature of his child . pornography charges, and asked her to consider the maximum sentence of . 20 years. 'It's not a petty offense,' he said through an interpreter. Losada will get credit for just more than 4 1/2 years of jail time already served. Funny man: Losada was famous for his character, Doña Concha, on the long-running Univisión variety show Sábado Gigante . Funny man: Adonis Losada once made people laugh whenever he wore a gray wig and granny glasses for his acting role on the popular Spanish-language TV variety show Sa¡bado Gigante on Univision . Before the trial got underway at the start of this year, Losada turned down a plea deal for a sentence of 20 years. At the time, he was facing the possibility of 330 years in jail. Assistant State Attorney Gregory Schiller asked for the 20-year maximum. However, just . before announcing the sentence, Miller threw out some charges of . transmission and possession of child pornography. She said her interpretation of the law required . Losada to be charged for the actual times he transmitted and accessed . child pornography, not for how many images he had. Miller . said because Losada was caught transmitting images only twice and . caught with images twice by police, he should face only two counts of . transmission and two counts of possession. Losada was first arrested in September . 2009 after connecting online with a Boynton Beach police detective . posing as a bilingual, bisexual adult male in a chat room for people . interested in having sex with children. The room was called '#baby@todderlove,' according to court records. Losada was famous for his character, Doña Concha, on the long-running Univisión variety show 'Sábado Gigante.' The gig ended with his arrest. Freedom curtailed: Losada faced 66 child pornography charges but in the end was only tried on 4. Over the years he's been transferred back and forth between jails in Florida . Losada, . who has consistently refused to be appointed a lawyer. During the trial he told a judge multiple times that he understood his constitutional . rights, and he rambled incoherently about the U.S. Constitution when . given a chance to speak. The prosecutor in the case, Schiller, said he respects the judge's . decision to give Losada 10 years, but was disappointed he didn't receive . more time because of the severity of the images he possessed. 'Idon't think any time less than the maximum — I don't think any . probationary period is going to rehabilitate Mr. Losada,' he said. 'In all my years of doing these kinds of cases, I've never seen images [of children] this young, or so horrible and heinous.'","Adonis Losada, 49, used to appear on the popular Spanish TV show Sábado Gigante .

"By . Leon Watson . Mobs burned and looted scores of foreign-owned factories in Vietnam in a 1000-strong protest by workers, it emerged today. The unrest in response to China's recent placement of an oil rig in disputed South-east Asian waters is the most serious outbreak of public disorder in the tightly controlled country in years. It points to the dangers for the government as it tries to manage public anger at China while also itself protesting the Chinese actions in an area of the South China Sea it says belongs to Vietnam. Firefighters stand across from the main entrance of Tan Than Industries as the Taiwanese bicycle factory burns, in Di An Town, Binh Duong province, Vietnam . Protesters stand on the corner of a street in Binh Duong province, near Song Than 2 Industrial Park in Vietnam . Vietnam has sent ships to confront the rig which are engaged in a tense standoff with Chinese vessels protecting it. The rioting that ran from Tuesday into Wednesday in Binh Duong province followed protests by up to 20,000 workers at the industrial parks. Smaller groups of men attacked factories they believed were Chinese-run, but many were Taiwanese or South Korean, the provincial government said in a statement. On Wednesday morning, groups of men on motorbikes remained on the streets and factories in the area were closed, said a park manager who declined to give his name because of the sensitivity of the situation. Riot police were stationed around the area but men were still seen carrying looted goods, said a security guard, who also declined to be identified. Police said 440 people had been detained over the violence. Tran Van Nam, vice chairman of the Bing Duong government, said Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean factories that hadn't already shut down had been asked to do so temporarily for the sake of public order. He said the 'situation was now under control.' Taiwanese-owned athletic shoe manufacturer Yue Yuen, which makes shoes for Nike, Adidas and Reebok, said it had closed its three complexes close to Ho Chi Minh City as a precautionary measure. Protesters raise Taiwanese flags and placards marching to Vietnam's consulate in Hong Kong . Unrest: A billboard placed outside the Vietnamese embassy in Beijing displays photos of (from left) Vietnam's tourism hotspots, Chinese and Vietnamese state leaders' official visit and factories in the country . Dispute: A Chinese ship, left, shoots water cannon at a Vietnamese vessel, right, while a Chinese Coast Guard ship, center, sails alongside in the South China Sea, off Vietnam's coast (file photo) 'We believe that this should be solved very soon, that somehow ultimately it will be up to the government authorities to guide the overall sentiment,' company spokesman Jerry Shum said. The Singapore government, which operates two industrial parks hit by rioters, called on Vietnam 'to act immediately to restore law and order ... before the security situation worsens and investor confidence is undermined.' The security guard said looters stormed his factory at 1am and took computers and anything valuable. 'The whole industrial zone looks like it was just smashed by a typhoon,' the guard said. Another executive said many foreign-owned factories were putting banners on the gates of the factories saying, 'We love Vietnam' and 'Hoang Sa, Truong Sa - Vietnam,' using the Vietnamese names for the Paracel and Spratly islands claimed by both Vietnam and China. The government said the protests were initially peaceful but were hijacked by 'extremists' who incited people to break into the factories. It said at least 15 factories were set alight and hundreds more vandalized or looted. China's Foreign Ministry and its embassy in Hanoi issued warnings to Chinese citizens and urged Vietnam's government to protect them. The embassy's website said it saw no end to attacks by what it called anti-China forces and urged Chinese to take safety precautions and avoid unnecessary travel. Low wages have attracted foreign investors from across the world to Vietnam in recent years. In 2013 Chinese invested $2.3 billion, a sharp rise from the previous year, according to the Ministry of Planning and Investment. The country is also Vietnam's biggest trading partner, exporting billions of dollars of materials each year for factories producing goods including clothes, shoes and smartphones. Vietnam reacted angrily after China towed a deep-sea oil rig on May 1 close to the Paracel Islands, which are controlled by China but claimed by Hanoi. It sent a flotilla of vessels to try to disrupt the oil rig. Some of the Vietnamese boats clashed with Chinese ships sent to protect the rig, raising fears of a possible conflict. China has shown no signs of backing down, and accused Vietnam on Wednesday of ""hyping"" the issue. 'We urge Vietnam to stop all provocative actions, come to their senses, and stop all acts intended to create disturbances,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. The standoff underlines China's aggressive pursuit of its territorial claims despite complaints from smaller nations such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which also claim parts of the waters. The United States, a treaty ally of the Philippines, has called the latest Chinese action 'provocative'. Over the weekend, the Vietnamese government gave rare permission for street protests against China in cities across the country. The protests were enthusiastically covered by the state media, unlike the ones on Tuesday, which appear to have been hit by a media blackout. The ruling Communist parties in China and Vietnam maintain close links and until May 1 had been trying to handle tensions over the territorial disputes quietly. Vietnamese authorities are normally highly nervous about spontaneous public gatherings of any sort. Many of the leaders of the anti-Chinese protests are also calling for basic democratic reforms, presenting a challenge to one-party rule. Last month, the Philippines protested China's efforts to reclaim land in a disputed reef in the South China Sea after surveillance aircraft took pictures of dredging by Chinese vessels at Johnson Reef in the Spratly Islands, which the Philippines says violates a regional non-aggression pact, Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said. Del Rosario said that it's not clear what China intends to build on the reef, which Manila claims as part of its western province of Palawan, but one possibility is an airstrip. Another official said China could also build an off-shore military base.

"By . Louise Eccles . Created: . 13:35 EST, 11 June 2013 . A wealthy academic was today cleared of assaulting her children’s nanny and smashing her mobile phone after they clashed in the street. Rebecca Forsyth, 29, claimed Chinese-born Dr Ping Zhu, 58, twisted her arm behind her back and broke her mobile phone after she tried to film her on her BlackBerry. Miss Forsyth claimed she had been ‘bullied and harassed' by Dr Zhu and wanted to capture her screaming and shouting on film. Cleared: Dr Ping Zhu, left, had denied charges of assault and criminal damage against Rebecca Forsyth, right . But Westminster Magistrates' Court . heard she was 'seeking to provoke a situation' during the incident at Dr . Zhu's home in Bayswater, west London. It . also emerged there was no evidence that Miss Forsyth's wrist had been . hurt during the tussle which resulted in police being called on November . 12 last year. Miss . Forsyth, who was employed by Dr Zhu’s ex-husband to care for the . couple’s two sons, arrived at the defendant's flat and began to film her . when she answered the door. The London-born nanny claimed that Dr Zhu became angry and called her a 'dirty s***'. But the mobile phone footage, which was shown in court, revealed Miss Forsyth shouting 'Come on, come on' at the academic. Tim . Moloney, defending, said today: 'There is absolutely no doubt that this . incident was instigated by Miss Forsyth, walking towards Miss Zhu, . holding the mobile phone as she advanced to stop the filming.' 'She said: 'Come on, come on'. Hardly clean hands.' District judge Vanessa Lloyd threw the case out after finding that Miss Forsyth's evidence was 'unreliable'. She added: 'There is no case to answer.' Dr Zhu had denied the charges of assault and criminal damage. On the footage, Miss Forsyth could be heard saying 'Get off my phone now, give me my phone. I'm going to call the police'. Dr Zhu is heard responding: 'Do call the police. Why you do this to me? Are you cruel?' Miss Forsyth, wearing blue skinny jeans and a black blazer, told the court: 'The reason I picked up my phone was I was pretty sure (Dr Zhu) was going to start shouting at me, like she had every time in the past for the last year - screaming malicious abuse at me in front of people. 'As far as I was concerned, I was being bullied out of my job. I was seeking legal advice at the time because no one was there to support me. 'I was being harassed at work.' But Mr Moloney, defending, said: 'You wanted to provoke her so that you could either sue her or get her arrested didn't you?' He added: 'She hadn't said anything to you before you took the phone out, had she?' Dr Zhu, wearing a black skirt and cream and pink scarf, smiled as she walked free from the dock. Miss Forsyth told the Mail outside court: 'My life has been ruined by this. I cannot get any other work.'","Rebecca Forsyth, 29, claimed Dr Ping Zhu, 58, had twisted her arm and broke her Blackberry during a struggle at west London flat .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . China is set to remove more than five million ageing cars from its roads this year in a bid to combat pollution, it was revealed today. Vehicles will be 'eliminated' throughout the country to improve air quality, with 330,000 to be decommissioned in Beijing alone, according to a Government policy document. The move will affect cars that are 'yellow label' - meaning they fail to meet Chinese fuel standards. Thick smog: China is set to remove five million ageing cars from its roads this year in a bid to combat pollution . The plans, unveiled in the document by China's cabinet, the State Council, aim to reverse the damage done by decades of breakneck growth. They also aspire to head off public anger about the state of the nation's air, water and soil. In the document, officials - for whom, pollution has emerged as an urgent priority - said the country had already fallen behind in its air quality targets from 2011 to 2013. So, as part of a plan to cut emissions over the next two years, up to 5.33million vehicles that fail to meet Chinese fuel standards will be decommissioned, they said. Chinese capital: Vehicles will be 'eliminated' throughout the country to improve air quality, with 330,000 to be decommissioned in Beijing (pictured) alone, according to a Government policy document published today . Beijing alone plans to . 'eliminate' 330,000 'cars this year - taking the total number of . vehicles on its roads to 5.6 million, allowed to rise to . six million by 2017. And a further 660,000 vehicles will be withdrawn from the surrounding province of Hebei, which was home to seven of China's smoggiest cities last year. According to Beijing's environmental watchdog, vehicle emissions in the capital were responsible for about 31 per cent of the hazardous airborne smog particles, known as PM 2.5. Over 22 per cent of these particles had originated from coal burning. Polluted: The move will affect 'yellow label' cars that fail to meet Chinese fuel standards . Officials have now set new targets for the closure of coal-fired heating systems, as well as the installation of equipment to reduce sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions at power stations, steel mills and cement plants. The document said China is aiming to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic growth by more than 4 percent this year - and more than 3.5 percent in 2015. It is hoped that this will enable the country to meet its binding 17-per-cent target set in its 2011-2015 five-year plan. The document added that China hopes to reduce energy consumption per unit of growth by 3.9 per cent this year, and the next, in order to meet a 16 per cent target for the 2011-2015 period. And the country aims to meet its 2011-2015 targets to cut outdated capacity in sectors like steel, glassmaking and cement by the end of this year - one year ahead of schedule. On top of the original targets, China will also close an additional 15 million tonnes of steel smelting capacity and 100 million tonnes of cement making capacity next year, the document said. And the country will step up efforts to create market mechanisms to reduce pollution, with the aim of establishing nationwide platforms that would allow enterprises to trade energy consumption and emission permits. Officials also promised to provide more policy support for China's clean-up programme, implement a new differential power pricing system aimed at encouraging efficiency, and punish wasteful enterprises, as well as improve financial support for projects designed to reduce emissions.","More than five million ageing vehicles will be 'eliminated' in China this year .

"By . Leon Watson . Jeremy Paxman has announced he is quitting the flagship current affairs show Newsnight saying he wants to 'go to bed at much the same time as most people'. The broadcaster, one of the most familiar faces on the BBC2 show, is one of the corporation's biggest stars. In a statement, he said: 'I have decided it is time to move on from Newsnight. After 25 years, I should rather like to go to bed at much the same time as most people. Scroll down for video . Veteran: Paxman, pictured left in on Newsnight in 1990, and right on the programme this year, . decided to leave last July . 'This was a decision I reached - and . informed the BBC of - last July. I shall work out the remainder of my . contract and will not seek another. 'It's . been fun. I have had the pleasure of working with lots of clever, . creative and amusing people. I think I've been lucky and wish the . programme well.' The BBC said Paxman, who has been on Newsnight for a quarter of a century, agreed to stay to help its new editor 'following a difficult period' which saw the show lambasted after it pulled a planned expose of Jimmy Savile's sex crimes. Paxman's resignation comes two weeks after he was scolded by the boss of Radio 1 . Treasury Minister Chloe Smith MP being interviewed by Jeremy Paxman in June 2012 .

He will present his last show in June and continue to host quiz show University Challenge. Director-general . Tony Hall said: 'This is a particularly poignant moment for me, because . I have known Jeremy and relished working with him, since the day I . joined the BBC in 1973. And I am therefore better placed than most to . know what a remarkable job he has done at Newsnight. 'His is a rare and dazzling talent. He . has a unique ability to create moments of real discomfort for . politicians and memorable delight for audiences. For that cussed . brilliance and much more besides, the BBC and our audiences will always . be in his debt.' The BBC's director of news, James Harding, said Paxman was the 'great lion of BBC journalism'. He . said: 'We accept his decision to move on but I think it is fair to say . that the only people really celebrating his decision will be the . politicians and public figures he has so often and so brilliantly held . to account.' The show's new . editor, Ian Katz, said it had been 'a huge privilege' to work with . Paxman and said he was 'deeply grateful' to him for agreeing to stay on.

He said: 'There's a pile of stuff on the BBC I can't stand. My idea of hell is going down in one of the lifts in that ghastly new building [New Broadcasting House] in a lift which has Radio 1Xtra plumbed into it. I don't quite understand why the BBC does Radio 1Xtra. 'I don't really understand why it does Radio 1. Clearly, you can meet those needs commercially.' However, Mr Cooper defended his stations and said the BBC's commercial rivals are unable to provide a comparable service. A close shave: Paxman's beard was the subject of much speculation last year. He later ditched it . He said: 'Commercial radio targeted at young listeners does not win awards for documentaries about domestic abuse in teenage relationships, it does not have two 15-minute news programmes in its daytime output listened to by more young people than watch the  10 O'Clock News, and it does not play 65 hours of specialist music  a week.' He added: 'If the licence fee is collected from everyone, then the BBC should represent the whole of society, not just certain parts of it.' In January, Paxman admitted that Newsnight . viewers would sometimes do better to turn off the television and go to . bed rather than watch the programme. The . anchor revealed that on some nights . he wanted to say, 'Not much happened today' - but added that he would . feel guilty about betraying his colleagues if he did so.

"By . Emma Glanfield . She may have once been the Prime Minister of Britain, but when it comes to painting and decorating it seems she wasn’t afraid to get her hands dirty. From ripping out skirting boards to installing ‘modern’ doors, Baroness Thatcher and her husband Sir Denis carried out a number of alterations to their £12million home in the wealthy Chester Square in Belgravia, London. However, some of the pair’s modifications are to be ‘corrected’ by builders who have been brought in to makeover the Georgian Grade II listed townhouse which was sold to Leconfield Property Group last year. Baroness Thatcher and her husband Sir Denis (pictured) carried out a number of alterations to their £12million home in the wealthy Chester Square in Belgravia, London . Workers on site have described the home as ‘unspectacular’ and claim it is not as grand as they believed it to be. In fact, they will spend the next 18 months renovating the property into a ‘traditional home’ and rid it of previous alterations which are ‘not fitting’ with the original character of the property. The house was bought by the Thatchers in 1990, shortly after the Baroness left Number 10. It was purchased from the Duke of Westminster, who owns the leasehold, and they spent more than a decade living at the property and carrying out improvements. It was later sold to a property group based in the British Virgin Islands in 2006, though Baroness Thatcher remained living there until a few months before her death in April last year. The latest owners now want to reverse some of the changes the Thatchers made to the property, which included lowering the ceilings, adding an ‘unsympathetic' extension, fitting carpet throughout and installing modern doors. According to planning submissions received by Westminster Council, the plans to renovate the property include efforts to rid it of previous alterations. The document states: ‘Throughout the property, there is evidence of original features being replaced with cornices, skirtings and other detailing, which are not fitting with the Georgian criterion.’ The house (left), in Chester Square, Belgravia, which is estimated to be worth around £12million, was bought by the Thatchers in 1990, shortly after the Baroness left Number 10. It was later sold to a property group based in the British Virgin Islands in 2006 and the new owners now want to carry out a number of alterations (right) Because of successive renovations few original features remain apart from the stucco and brick front, according to a Heritage Statement submitted with the planning application. Prepared by Turley Associates as part of plans approved by Westminster Council, the statement explains the most wide ranging renovations happened after the Thatchers had moved in. It states: ‘Planning records indicate that a comprehensive refurbishment scheme was undertaken in the early 1990s, including the building of a rear range extending the house up to the mews lane at the rear. ‘As found today, the existing rear closet wing of the house does not retain its original form or appearance. ‘Evidence suggests that this element has been considerably altered during the 20th century. This has resulted in an unbalanced and unsympathetic appearance. ‘There is a traditional style interior scheme throughout, which also appears to be largely modern and of a design rather overly grand for a house of this period and status.’ The document quotes from a pre-application statement prepared by Westminster Council which states: ‘The reinstatement of appropriately detailed skirting and cornicing is welcomed in listed building terms. I would encourage you to remove all modern lowered ceilings as part of your application.’ Baroness Thatcher waves to well-wishers from her Belgravia home after leaving hospital in 2010 . Builders are set to spend the next 18 months giving the Georgian Grade II listed townhouse a traditional makeover, following its sale to Leconfield Property Group last year . Plans, approved last month by Westminster Council, aim to ‘retain the key historic elements of the internal spaces that remain and/or adapt them sympathetically to the new domestic layout. ‘In addition potential opportunities have been identified to reinstate or enhance features of the former interiors where appropriate, as part of the application scheme.’ Renovations include: installing a porch to match the rest of the terrace, remodelling the rear closet wing to improve its appearance, replacing the modern roof with a mansard one that matches the other terraces, creating a more ‘traditionally designed’ mews building, removing modern partitions between rooms and modern doors and removing elements of the ‘unsympathetic modern interior scheme’. A lift will also be installed in the rear closet extension and a lower ground floor extension and first floor extension with terrace above will be created under the mews building. Plans of the proposed development show that on the lower ground floor, a room marked for ‘security’ will be converted into a bedroom with the mews being replaced with a wine store and ‘media room’. The Thatchers' library on the ground floor will become a ‘snug’ while bedrooms, dressing rooms and en suite bathrooms on upper floors will be altered. Hands on: Then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher painting her Belgravia home in 1984 . Baroness Thatcher also helped her daughter Carol decorate her flat in 1984 (pictured) George Brooksbank, one of the . directors of the Belgravia-based property company, said: ‘We're aiming . to create a traditional family home, with renovation work that will keep . and enhance its period features. ‘The renovation work will be extensive, including adding a basement and demolishing and rebuilding the mews. ‘We're bound by strict confidentiality agreements which means we cannot discuss facts and figures, but the house is expected to be completed within 18 months.’ Site manager Bruno, who has been working on the site for a couple of weeks, described the house as ‘unspectacular’. He said: ‘There's nothing particularly exciting about it, it’s just a house. I've worked on lots of properties in this area and many are much grander than this. ‘When I heard I would be working on it I thought the house would be much grander than it is, which is the surprising thing. Plans, approved last month by Westminster Council, aim to 'retain the key historic elements of the internal spaces that remain and/or adapt them sympathetically to the new domestic layout' George Brooksbank, one of the directors of the Belgravia-based property company, said: 'We're aiming to create a traditional family home, with renovation work that will keep and enhance its period features' ‘There are white walls throughout and the rooms are 90 per cent carpeted with just a bit of marble in the entrance hall. ‘The most special thing about this house is the person that lived here, not the house itself.’ Mr Brooksbank said he expected the house would be bought by a British family. He added: ‘It's a very traditional area with many English families, as well as some people from ethnic minorities. It's a popular place to live.’ The developers are awaiting permission to excavate beneath the basement and lower ground floor level, introduce a new staircase and make internal alterations.","The Baroness and husband Sir Denis carried out renovations at their home .

"By . Emma Glanfield . The author behind hit children’s television show Charlie And Lola has revealed how talk of the animated series initially caused anxiety at the BBC – because of potential injuries which could be caused by a character performing a forward roll. Lauren Child, who has sold millions of copies of her books about Charlie and his younger sister Lola, said the BBC became ‘terribly worried’ during talks of adapting her novels for the small screen. The illustrator and writer told Radio Times magazine that when it came to making the animated TV series, the corporation was concerned about the potential for injury when Lola did a forward roll. Lauren Child, who has sold millions of copies of her books about Charlie and his younger sister Lola, said the BBC became 'terribly worried' during talks of adapting her novels for the small screen . ‘We almost had a problem with Lola doing forward rolls,’ she told the magazine. ‘The BBC got terribly worried she could have a dreadful accident and break her neck. ‘It doesn't matter that she and Charlie are fictional, and they're made of paper. The designers had to draw a very squishy mattress for her to do her forward roll on.’ Ms Child's also said that an episode she proposed in which Lola caught head-lice was rejected by the Disney corporation, which had partially financed the show. Her comments came as the magazine compiled a shortlist of the best BBC children's characters though the decades, featuring the likes of Sooty and Sweep from the 1950s, and shows such as The Magic Roundabout from the 1960s, Paddington Bear in the 1970s, Willo The Wisp in the 1980s and more recently, Teletubbies and In The Night Garden. Richard Starzak, who devised the much-loved Shaun The Sheep - a spin-off from Wallace And Gromit - told the magazine that children's TV had become too safe. He said: ‘Slapstick is a universal language. There's a lot of comedy in other people's pain, of course. ‘But there are things you can't do on . children's shows. We can't really have characters being hit on the head. I understand why. We don't want to be responsible for kids hitting each . other with frying pans. The illustrator and writer told Radio Times magazine that when it came to making the animated TV series for Charlie and Lola, the corporation was concerned about the potential for injury when Lola performed a forward roll . ‘But . I sometimes think children's TV can be overly safe. I don't think . cartoon-style violence affects kids. I think it's a bit of escapism.’ He said of watching ITV's Tiswas during his own childhood: ‘They used to lift children out of tea chests by their ears. Then, one Saturday, one of the kids cut himself on the edge of the chest, and was bleeding on live TV. ‘Chris Tarrant lifted him out, put him to one side and said: “Could you pass me another one that's not bleeding?” And they carried on with the show. Can you imagine the front pages of the newspapers if that happened today?’ Meanwhile Keith Chapman - whose show Bob The Builder has raked in millions of pounds from TV sales and merchandising around the world and also features on the list - said his series was nearly called Bill The Builder or Bob The Construction Worker. He said: ‘It was a toss-up between Bill The Builder and Bob The Builder. But Bill didn't sound quite right.’ Chapman said that he was advised that the term ‘builder’ is not often used in the US, ‘but, thankfully, in the end they let us keep the name’. Anne Wood, co-creator of the Teletubbies, also recalled her horror of learning US evangelist Jerry Falwell had denounced one of the show's characters - Tinky Winky - who is purple and carries a handbag, for ‘role modelling the gay lifestyle’. ‘It was so insulting,’ she told the magazine. ‘The fact is that children's television is about love, it's got nothing to do with sex at all. And all children - boys and girls - love to look in your handbag. I haven't known a child who didn't.’ Popular: Basil Brush . 1950s .

"By . Harriet Arkell . It's the TV show that lets us watch fellow viewers watching the same programmes as us - but tonight the Gogglebox stars will be watching themselves on the box. In tonight's final episode of the award-winning Channel 4 series, the Gogglebox families will watch themselves winning a Bafta. Unemployed Scarlett Moffatt, who 'jumped up in disbelief' at landing the award, said she received a text from the Tapper family in north London saying: 'We've only gone and f***ing done it'. Scarlett Moffatt, from Darlington, Co Durham, will be shown watching her show Gogglebox win a Bafta tonight . The 23-year-old, who lives in Co Durham, will be shown watching the film and television awards with her parents, Betty and Mark Moffatt, at home in Darlington, Co Durham. Scarlett and her family feature alongside other Gogglebox families including couch potatoes Linda, Pete and George Gilbey from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, Jewish couple, Jonathan and Nikki Tapper and their teenage children from north London, and 'posh couple' Dom and Steph Parker, from Sandwich, Kent. Scarlett said what made the show popular was the fact that it showed 'normal' people watching television. 'You can relate to the characters and feel like you're invited into our front rooms', she told the Daily Star. Last month, the show was hit by a fakery row when one of its stars claimed that the programme was scripted, with families being fed funny comments and told which scenes to react to. A cast member, who asked not to be named, told a newspaper: 'I have decided to speak out as a few people have started to comment on Twitter that there are things on the show that look fake. Well, they are right. We don’t film across the week. You set aside a night for filming and it can go on for hours. ‘We also keep changing clothes, food and drinks to make it look like we’re filmed on different nights. Scarlett said she received a text from the Jewish Tapper family in north London celebrating the show's win . Snooty? Gogglebox's 'posh couple', Steph and Dom Parker, don't talk to Scarlett, she said . ‘Sometimes we are told ""Louis Walsh is going to say something shocking on X Factor so we want you to react to that"". ‘If you can’t think of anything, the producers come up with  a joke. If you fluff it they film it again.’ Scarlett said this was untrue, saying the only thing the show's producers paid for was the occasional takeaway and electricity bill. This week, it was revealed that the home of the show's 'posh couple', Dom and Steph Parker, was used for an upmarket sex party organised by a friend of the Duchess of Cambridge. Private swingers' club, Killing Kittens, run by Emma Sayle, who was at Downe House School with Kate Middleton, held a £500-a-ticket orgy at the Parkers' £3.5million mansion, The Salutation, last weekend. The Parkers are known for roaring with laughter as they knock back vats of red wine and vodka from their cream sofa. Pete and Linda Gilbey, and their son George, are shown watching television at home in Clacton, Essex . But Scarlett said they were her least favourite Gogglebox stars, saying they were the only ones on the show who didn't speak to the others. Admitting she had to put on subtitles to understand their upper class accents, she said: 'I think they don't want to because we're working class.  They're too posh for our banter.' And she said if the couple were northern and working class, rather than well-spoken, they would be judged for the amount they drank. The graduate also criticised female vicar Kate Bottley for wearing her dog collar while watching television, saying: 'You don't see the hairdressers hanging out at home with a pair of scissors'. After tonight's Bafta success for the show, the question of what next for its stars will arise. Scarlett said she hoped to go into politics, or to have her own TV debate show, debating such issues as 'Is Elvis really dead?'.","Channel 4's hit reality TV show's last episode will be shown at 9pm tonight .

"By . Hugo Gye . These pictures show the dramatic aftermath of a car crash which saw a Renault flip through the air and end up balanced on a garden fence. No one was seriously hurt in the 70mph smash, which happened early yesterday morning in an area known to be a hotspot for speeding drivers. The teenager who was driving the car - thought to have been stolen - was arrested in the aftermath of the crash in Milton, outside Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire. Smash: This Renault Clio ended up impaled on a concrete fence post following a crash yesterday morning . Escape: The two teenagers inside the car both managed to get out with only minor injuries . Residents said they saw the black Renault Clio somersault through the air at 5.10 yesterday morning. It ended up impaled on a 6ft concrete fence post, balanced precariously on its end - but both occupants of the car were able to get out. Images of the aftermath were captured by Clifford Beeton, a milkman who was on his morning round at the time. 'It was amazing anyone came out of the car alive,' he said. 'I was taking a break from my round and was eating a banana when this car zoomed past me at around 70mph. 'It missed my van by a matter of inches and I could see the driver staring wildly ahead. Close call: A 6ft concrete gate post was impaled through the roof of the car after the accident . Area: This map shows the suburban area of Staffordshire where the accident took place . 'The next thing I head was a screech, a scrape and a bang and as I turned the car double-somersaulted through the air and landed on the fence post. 'It was like a scene out of a James Bond movie - the car seemed to fly through the air in slow motion. 'I was convinced whoever was in the car must be dead but as I approached the car the two lads in the front seats were dangling upside down by their belts. 'They managed to free themselves and stumble away. It was a miracle anyone survived.' A female passenger was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire to be treated for minor injuries. Scene: Local residents say their quiet neighbourhood has been plagued by dangerous driving . The 19-year-old man who was behind the wheel was subsequently arrested on suspicion of stealing the vehicle, according to Staffordshire Police. 'Police were called to a report of a road traffic collision in Caton Crescent / Magnolia Drive, Stoke-on-Trent, at around 5.10am on Monday 26 May,' a spokesman said. 'A Renault Clio had been in collision with a garden wall and overturned. 'A 19-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent was arrested nearby on suspicion of taking a motor vehicle without the owner's consent. He was released on bail pending further inquiries until a date in June. 'A 19-year-old woman from Stoke-on-Trent, believed to be a passenger, was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire for treatment to minor injuries. ' Inspector Kevin Treacy added: 'A black Renault Clio left the road and ended up on its roof in the garden of a property on that road. 'The car was recovered away from the property. The fire service did go to make the vehicle stable, but there was no fire risk.' Locals say they frequently see drivers travelling dangerously fast in the area, and have called for lower speed limits and traffic-calming measures.","The crash took place in Milton, Staffordshire at 5.10am yesterday .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Jodi Hudson, centre, at her daughter Lexi's funeral. Miss Hudson now says she has received death threats following her daughter's death. A mother whose daughter was mauled to death by their pet dog has been forced to move home and change identity after receiving death threats. Four-year-old Lexi Branson died in November last year when the dog 'suddenly turned' on her in the lounge of her home in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire while she was off school because she was poorly. Her mother Jodi Hudson was forced to stab the animal in order to free her daughter as she was shaken 'like a rag doll' after the dog pounced. The bulldog, which was a stray called Mulan, was adopted by the family two months before the incident. Now the single mother has revealed she has had threats and hate mail on social media, leading her to move to a secret address and change her surname. She also said that she hired security to protect her and her family during Lexi's funeral, which took place at the Holy Trinity Church in Barrow-upon-Soar in Leicestershire. She told the Daily Mirror: 'As if losing my beautiful little girl isn't bad enough - people now want me dead too. 'Some are saying it was my fault for having a dangerous dog. It's so cruel and now I always look over my shoulder. I was scared for my life at the funeral.' The 31-year-old also says she still has nightmares and is undergoing counselling while she tries to rebuild her life. The dog came from Willow Tree Rehoming Centre and at the time Leicester City Council confirmed a dog warden took the dog off the streets and handed it into the kennels before Miss Hudson took it in. Miss Hudson had been concerned at a poster of the dog which included a warning it was unsuitable for 'small children'. Lexi was in the lounge of her home in Leicestershire, while she was off school poorly, when the dog attacked her . But when she asked about the sign she was allegedly told the dog would be fine if it wasn't 'allowed to jump up'. It is understood that the rehoming centre has now closed. The dog, thought to be between six and eight years-old, also died during the incident from stab wounds. At the time of her death, Lexi's family described her as 'our shining star in the sky' who 'will never be forgotten'. In a statement her mother and grandmother Kerry Hudson said: 'Lexi was a bubbly, bright little girl. The dog, a stray bulldog called Mulan, pictured, which was adopted by the family carried out the attack . 'She fought for her life from the moment she was born as she was born 3 months prematurely, she’s been taken from us so tragically. 'She will be sadly missed, she will be our shining star in the sky and she we will never be forgotten.' Her mother and grandmother are also planning a campaign to warn people about the dangers of some rescue dogs and are calling for better vetting procedures. An inquest into her death is expected to take place later this year.","Jodi Hudson says she has had death threats following her daughter's death .

"By . James  Nye . Great day: The actor Gary Sinise, who played Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump, said he was 'Honored to meet 98-year-old WW2 veteran Lt. Colonel. Dick Cole of the Doolittle Raiders. Jimmy Doolittle's co-pilot. Amazing man' It was the retaliatory strike that restored national morale after the staggering shock of Pearl Harbor. And now the brave American airmen who carried out the 1942 Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, taking the fight to the heart of Japan for the first time, have been honored with the nation's highest award. Only four of those 80 pilots are still alive and on Memorial Day, Lt. Col. Richard E. Cole, 98, accepted the Congressional Gold Medal on behalf of his comrades. 'This . Congressional Gold Medal was hard earned and long overdue for a group of . heroes who literally turned the tide for America in the Pacific Theater . of World War II,' said Rep. Pete Olson, R-Texas, in a statement as Lt. Col. Cole accepted the medal as the grand marshall in Monday's Memorial . Day parade in Washington. 'I'm proud to have carried the mantle to see these men receive the honor they so richly deserve.' Cole and his three comrades, who are 94, 93 and 92 years old were finally honored last week during a ceremony in the Oval Office with President Obama. The Doolittle Raiders, led by Army Air . Forces Lt. Col. James Doolittle, launched their audacious retribution . from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet in 16 B-25 bombers on . April 18, 1942. Approval: President Barack Obama signs an act to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II members of the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders in recognition of their military service during World War II. Standing behind the president is 98-year-old retired, Lt. Col. Richard Cole - who flew in the raid . Hero:  Lt. Col. Richard Cole, a member of the Doolittle Raiders who bombed Japan, visits the grave site of Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, who he flew with on the bombing mission, buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, May 23, 2014 . Their one-way mission was to strike Tokyo and Japan and restore the badly damaged pride of a nation still reeling from the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which cost 2,471 service-men's lives. That attack destroyed the myth of American impregnability and in the dark months that followed the Imperial Japanese Navy's lightning advances across the Pacific caused national confidence to plummet. President Roosevelt demanded an immediate response and it was Doolittle who provided him with one. No military operation of this kind had ever been attempted before. Unprecedented: Visible on the deck of the USS Hornet are eight of the 16 B-25 bombers that launched on April 18, 1942, to attack Tokyo . Staggering: An Army B-25 bomber takes off from the deck of the USS Hornet on its way to take part in the first U.S. air raid on Japan in April 1942 . One way ticket: An Army B-25 takes off from the deck of the USS Hornet on its way to take part in the first U.S. air raid on Japan, the Doolittle Raid . Doolittle wanted to launch huge B-25 bombers from the deck of an aircraft carrier - stripping the planes of any unnecessary weight, with only enough fuel to clear Japan. From there the planes would carry on to Nationalist China, then friendly to the US. The Raiders, unaware of their mission, departed from the USS Hornet 600 miles east of Japan. A chance encounter with a Japanese fishing boat, which they destroyed, forced the Raiders to leave early, meaning they would not have enough fuel to make it to their planned landing zones in China. The plan was changed so that the raiders understood they had to traverse enemy territory. Cole still remembers what Doolittle said about the unprecedented attack before they took off. 'He said that it was a very dangerous mission. Anybody wanted to back out, they could without any repercussions.' No one backed out. Declaration of war: A ball of flame erupts from gasoline stores or aircraft at the Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941. Base personnel can only watch helplessly as the Japanese surprise attack destroys much of the area . Damage to morale: The USS Arizona burns after being hit by a Japanese bomb in Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941 . Once aboard the plane, Cole said the crew was silent before take-off. Doolittle warned his crew they might not even reach China after the bombs were dropped. Cole said that he began to tap out the rhythm to 'The Wabash Cannonball', a folk song about a train speeding to its destination. Innovator: American aviator and military officer James Doolittle (1896 - 1993), wearing his uniform before he led the first aerial raid on Japan in World War II . He told The Washington Post that Doolittle shot him a look without saying word. 'I think maybe he thought I'd gone off the deep end,' said Cole. After the bombs had been dropped on Tokyo, Doolittle ordered his crews to bail out of their planes at 9,000 feet, at night. 'For me, that was the scariest time,' Cole said, not knowing whether they would land in the South China Sea or land. 'I pulled the parachute ripcord so hard, and looking down, that I gave myself a black eye,' he said to the Washington Post. Cole was left hanging 12-feet up in a tree's branches until the morning - when friendly locals rescued him. 'I . started walking west,' said Cole to The Fort Hood Sentinel. 'We knew . that if we walked west, we would be leaving and getting away from . (Japanese) occupied territory.' As a result, following the bombing, 15 of the planes crash-landed in rural China, while the 16th bomber made it to Russia. The . Raiders were aided by Chinese peasants, thousands of whom were later . killed by the Japanese for their support of the Americans. Aftermath: Jimmy Doolittle with his bombing crew and some Chinese friends are pictured here in China, after the airmen bailed out following Doolittle's raid on Japan, on April 18, 1942. (Left to right are Stf. Sgt. F. Braemer, bombardier from Seattle; Stf. Sgt. P. J. Leonard, engineer-gunner of Denver; Lt. R. E. Cole (still living), copilot of Dayton; General Doolittle; and Lt. H. A. Potter, navigator, of Pierre, South Dakota . Of the 80 Raiders, three died during the landings and eight were captured by the Japanese. Three of those captured were executed, one died in captivity, and four remained prisoners of war and survived the war. The attack, which did not do much damage to Japan's munitions factories, shifted momentum in the Pacific conflict. 'The Japanese were completely surprised,' said Colonel C.V. Glines, 91, the official Raiders historian. 'They did not think the United States had the range for that type of attack.' Japan brought more troops home to protect the mainland, leaving it vulnerable in the Pacific. Rejuvenated US troops took advantage, defeating the Japanese at the Battle of Midway two months later, turning the war for good. Veterans: Three of the four surviving members of the 1942 Tokyo raid led by Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, (left to right), David Thatcher, Edward Saylor, and Richard Cole, pose next to a monument marking the raid, Saturday, Nov. 9, 2013, outside the National Museum for the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio . Tradition begins: James Doolittle, (third from left, front row) who led the air raid on Japan, April 18, 1942, and some of the men who flew with him drink a champagne toast from coffee cups during a reunion in North Africa on the first anniversary of the flight on July 14, 1943 . Cole, 98, who was Doolittle's co-pilot, said the aviator deserved much of the credit for the raid. Doolittle died in 1993 at age 96. 'He personified the finest of human qualities, and he set a standard of military leadership that was unprecedented.' As far as the Raiders' role in the war and continuing legend, Cole said, 'We are grateful we had the opportunity to serve and mindful that the nation benefited from our service.' All 80 raiders were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The five imprisoned raiders were awarded the Purple Heart. Three received the Silver Star for gallantry and all received decorations from the Chinese government. Doolittle was awarded the Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general. Cole retired from the U.S. Air Force in South Texas in January of 1967 after serving in Korea and having been stationed in Tokyo. Final time: Richard Cole, center, proposes a toast for the last time with two other surviving members of the 1942 Tokyo raid led by Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle, Edward Saylor, left, and David Thatcher at the National Museum for the US Air Force in Dayton, Ohio . Last year, three of four surviving raiders attended the annual toast in Ohio that Jimmy Doolittle started in memory of their mission and fallen comrades. They decided that last years would be the final toast. 'May they rest in peace,' Lt. Col. Richard Cole, 98, said before he and fellow Raiders — Lt. Col. Edward Saylor, 93, and Staff Sgt. David Thatcher, 92 — sipped cognac from specially engraved silver goblets. The 1896 cognac was saved for the occasion after being passed down from Doolittle. Hundreds invited to the ceremony, including family members of deceased Raiders, watched as the three each called out 'here' as a historian read the names of all 80 of the original airmen. The fourth surviving Raider, Lt. Col. Robert Hite, 93, couldn't travel to Ohio last year because of health problems.","The 80 airmen who flew the 1942 Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, Japan, were honored with the Congressional Gold Medal on Monday .

"By . Kate Lyons . A run-down shack in inner Sydney with a rotting deck, collapsing walls and disintegrating floorboards sold for almost a million dollars on Saturday. The property on Edith Street, Leichhardt, was expected to sell for $850,000, but ended up going for $980,000 at auction. The small cottage has been uninhabited for 20 years and is in a state of very poor repair – the walls that have not disintegrated are covered in graffiti and the house is littered with rubbish. This house in Leichhardt in inner-Sydney sold for $980,000 on the weekend, despite the fact that it is an unlivable shack . The backyard features the remnants of an outdoor toilet with rubbish strewn about and patches of weeds the only vegetation. The 278sq metre block is on a quiet and desirable street near Leichhardt's main shopping strip and the Hawthorne canal. The block has DA approved plans for a four bedroom and two bathroom house to be built. Selling agent Shad Hassen of McGrath Estate Agents Inner West Leichhardt said he was surprised that the house had sold for such a high price. The house has not been lived in for 20 years. The floors, walls and ceilings have disintegrated . The Leichhardt home is in a quiet and desirable block, close to shops, cafes and a new light rail stop . The million-dollar property is going to be pulled down and a new house built on the block by the new owners . 'It's a timber shack, it basically needs a bit of attention, it's not liveable at the moment, it's got holes in the walls, holes in the floors,' he said. 'I think it's an opportunity for people to build something they'd like,' said Mr Hassen who added that most people who were bidding for the home were keen to renovate and sell. He added that despite its condition, he is not surprised that people were so eager to purchase land in Leichhardt, where properties regularly sell for over a million dollars. 'It's in a great spot, the area is well-serviced in terms of shops, cafes, restaurants, now with the new light rail the public transport is great,' he said. The ceiling, walls and floor are disintegrating and the backyard features the remains of an outhouse and weeds .

"By . Andrew Levy . A mother and her two young children fled for their lives when an e-cigarette exploded, setting their flat on fire. Keeley Cooper, 22, heard ‘an almighty bang’ as the device, which was charging, burst into flames. She tried to extinguish the blaze, but it spread quickly and she raced to rescue sons Ellis, five, and Riegan, two. Keeley Cooper, pictured (right) with sons Regan (left) and Ellis (right), has said she'll never use an e-cigarette again after her flat was gutted by a fire started by one of the devices on charge . A fireman told Miss Cooper the clouds of toxic smoke could have killed the  family if they had been asleep. Yesterday . she said: ‘I’d put it on charge next to my bed. It had been charging . for 40 minutes when there was an almighty bang. It sounded like a . firework. ‘It burst into . flames and the carpet was on fire. I thought I had put the flames out . but smoke began pouring from under the bed. I tried to lift it, but it . was too heavy and the fire was getting worse. ‘The only thing I could do was get me and the kids out. I grabbed them and ran downstairs.’ Firefighters . put out the flames, but the bedroom was gutted. The rest of the flat . was badly damaged by smoke and the children’s toys and clothes had to be . thrown out. Miss Cooper had been using the e-cigarette as she quit a ten-a-day smoking habit. She said: ‘I’ll never buy another e-cigarette and have no intention of returning to normal cigarettes. ‘If . anybody has an electronic  cigarette I recommend you get rid of it now. Me and the kids have nothing left. It just isn’t worth it.’ The device came with a charging lead but no plug, she said, so she used a phone charger – contrary to the maker’s instructions. Miss .

"By . Associated Press . Herb Jeffries, the jazz singer and actor who performed with Duke Ellington and was known as the 'Bronze Buckaroo' in a series of all-black 1930s Westerns, died of heart failure Sunday morning at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 100. His death was confirmed by Raymond Strait, who worked with Jeffries on his not-yet-published autobiography titled 'Color of Love.' Star: Herb Jeffries, pictured, has been described as the only black singing cowboy star in Hollywood history . Singer: Jeffries, seen here in a 1957 still for 'Calypso Joe,' appeared as vocalist for Duke Ellington on the song 'Flamingo' With a mellow voice and handsome face, Jeffries became familiar to jazz fans, but segregation in the film industry limited his movie career. He scored a big hit with Ellington as the vocalist on 'Flamingo,' recorded in 1940 and later covered by a white singer, the popular vocalist Tony Martin. Among the other songs he did with Ellington were 'There Shall Be No Night' and 'You, You Darlin'.' 'The camaraderie in his band was like a bunch of guys in college,' Jeffries recalled in the book 'Off the Record: An Oral History of Popular Music.' ''Ellington had a knack for developing talent and stars. ... He was more like a father to me than a boss.' Jeffries has been described as the only black singing cowboy star in Hollywood history and, more recently, after the deaths of Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and others, as the 'last of the singing cowboys.' Background: Jeffries described himself in 2004 as 'an Italian-looking mongrel with a percentage of Ethiopian blood, which enabled me to get work with black orchestras' Sometimes billed as Herbert Jeffrey, he starred in four Westerns aimed at black audiences from 1937 to 1939: 'Harlem on the Prairie,' 'Two-Gun Man From Harlem,' ''The Bronze Buckaroo' and 'Harlem Rides the Range.' As The New York Times noted, the low-budget films (produced by a white man, Richard C. Kahn) are 'notable less for what's in them than that they exist at all.' Jeffries starred as Bob Blake. The films featured his horse Stardusk, the vocal group the Four Tones, and comic relief from prolific character actor Mantan Moreland. Among the songs: 'I'm a Happy Cowboy,' ''Get Along Mule' and '(Got the) Payday Blues.' 'The Bronze Buckaroo' was recently revived on a DVD release called 'Treasures of Black Cinema.' Jeffries 'did something outrageous, and then rode off into the sunset,' actor-director Mario Van Peebles told People magazine in 2005. 'He did us proud.' Jeffries remained active as a singer into his 80s and 90s, touring and putting out the 1995 CD 'The Bronze Buckaroo (Rides Again)' and following it up in 2000, with 'The Duke and I.' Among the honors that came his way late in life was a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, dedicated in 2004. 'I don't believe in age,' Jeffries told The New York Times in 1995, when he was appearing at a local club. 'I believe this magnificent thing we have on our shoulders can help you evolve,' he said. 'In jazz, we keep going. There's no such thing as retiring, or being retired, so you never feel unwanted or useless. And that keeps your body vital.' Cowboy: Jeffries is best known for appearing in a series of all-black 1930s Westerns . Star: In this 2004 file photo, Herb Jeffries, right, is congratulated by jazz great Gerald Wilson following dedication ceremonies for Jeffries' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . He was born in Detroit to a racially mixed couple, referring to himself in a 2004 interview with The Oklahoman as 'an Italian-looking mongrel with a percentage of Ethiopian blood, which enabled me to get work with black orchestras.' He lamented the days touring in the South when he was with Earl Hines in the 1930s. Black audiences were made to stand separately off in a corner and not allowed to dance. 'I don't think anybody was thrilled about the conditions, but if you wanted to advance and develop you couldn't show anger,' he said. He made light of the covering of 'Flamingo,' too, recalling he joked with Martin that he knew Martin had copied him because 'you made the same mistake in the lyrics that I did.' Jeffries told American Visions, a publication on African-American culture, in 1997 that he was inspired to seek backing for the cowboy movies after seeing a black boy crying because other children with him 'wouldn't let him play cowboy. But in the real West, one of every four cowboys was black.' But he had no plans to star in them himself, he said, until the search for a suitable actor-singer-rider came up short and he embarked on a crash course on lasso handling and other Western skills. Strait said Jeffries recently had several surgeries that 'just wore him out.' He added that Jeffries 'believed in one world and one people and was one of the most generous people I've ever met. He was always funding something or doing something for kids.' Jeffries is survived by his fifth wife, Savannah; three daughters; and two sons.","Jeffries has been described as the only black singing cowboy star in Hollywood history .

Despite disagreeing with his politics, Ms Emin sold the bed for £150,000. My Bed - complete with soiled sheets, empty vodka bottles and cigarette butts - is now worth nearly ten times more than what Charles Saatchi bought it for in 2000. He paid £150,000 but it is now set to fetch up to £1.2m . The piece is a ‘confessional self-portrait’ that was created in Ms Emin’s Waterloo flat in 1998 after the artist suffered a bout of severe depression accompanied by excessive drinking and bouts of casual sex. The 50-year-old artist told The Telegraph the sale feels ‘like the end of an era. Saatchi’s had this Nineties thing in his house like a time capsule. Now it’s historical.’ Last weekend, David Maupin, Emin’s dealer in New York, who sold the bed to Saatchi, said he thinks the estimate of £800,000 to £1.2 million is too low for such a significant work. ‘It’s historic,’ he said. ‘It’s priceless.’ My Bed is going to be sold at auction this summer, when Christie’s offers Tracey Emin’s My Bed from Charles Saatchi’s collection.

"By . Daniel Mills . All cars in Australia could soon be fitted with a device that prevents drunk motorists getting behind the wheel and driving. The bold prediction was made on Tuesday by Victorian Transport Minister Terry Mulder, who declared technological advances would mean the $1000 devices would one day be a permanent feature inside all new Australian vehicles sold. The prediction, if acted on, could bring the high rate accidents and deaths caused by drunk motorists to zero. Working much like a standard police breath testing unit, interlocks register the amount of alcohol in the driver's blood and prevent the car from starting if a person reaches a certain limit. Interlocking devices will be introduced into all Victorian vehicles by 2016 . They also record the number of times offenders have tried to start their car while under the influence of alcohol. Minister Mulder said the revolutionary device would prevent drunks from putting lives at risk. More... Kyle Sandilands may lose drivers licence . 'Female-friendly' spaces that help women park more easily (and so-called 'she-spots' will even be placed closer to shops) He delivered this prediction, that all Australian cars will be fitted with the device, while announcing new laws for Victoria that will require all drink-driving offenders to fork out $1000 to fit them in their cars by 2016. He said Victoria is making the first step towards a blanket rule that would see every Australian car prevent their drivers from getting behind the wheel drunk. Terry Mulder wants to see all cars in Australia one day fitted with interlocking devices preventing drunks from driving . Interlocks work by preventing the the car from being started unless the driver, who blows into the device, passes a breath test . 'Technological advances mean that in the long-term alcohol interlocks are likely to be a standard feature of all new vehicles in Australia,' he said. 'But in the meantime, Victoria is leading the way in taking action to reduce the menace caused by drink driving offenders.' Victorian police Minister Peter Ryan has backed a uniform law for interlocking devices to be fitted into Australian vehicles. 'The user-pays system ensures there's a powerful financial deterrent to drink-driving,' Mr Ryan said. Cameras will be fitted to Victorian cars by 2015 to prevent someone else from blowing into a drunk-driver's interlocking device . Minister Mulder said drink-drivers make up 25 to 30 percent of deaths and 11 percent of serious injuries on Victorian roads. Repeat drink-drivers make up 20 percent. In October this year, first time drink-driving offenders in Victoria will find themselves paying top dollar for an interlocking unit if they are caught by police registering a reading of .07 or more. Probationary drivers and those with a cancelled licence caught with readings of between .05 and .07 will also be required to fit them. By 2016, drink-drivers caught registering any alcohol in their blood, will be forced to have them installed. Interlocking immobilisers also register the amount of times a person has blown a high reading . In October last year, the NSW Government announced similar legislation, which will soon come into affect. Most laws in other states require drivers to fit the interlocking immobilisers if they have been caught twice within five years with blood-alcohol readings of 0.15 or above. The Western Australian government only just this month passed legislation for repeat offenders to install breath-testing immobilisers for some of the state's worst repeat drink-driving offenders. Mr Mulder, in introducing the new laws, said: 'the community has asked us to act on this. We are going to act on this and we are going to act in a very, very strong manner.'","Victorian MP Terry Mulder said new cars will stop drunk motorists driving .

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 05:30 EST, 10 February 2012 . Glaciers in the Himalayas: The new survey, using data from Nasa satellites reveals that Himalayan glaciers are melting far more slowly than predicted . Himalayan glaciers are melting far more slowly than predicted, according to a new satellite study from the University of Colorado Boulder. Previous estimates of . ice loss in the high Asia mountains have ranged up to 50 billion tons a year, said the university's Professor John Wahr. The actual figure is a mere four billion tonnes, according to a survey using data from Nasa satellites. Previously, it had been claimed that Himalayan glaciers would have melted to a fifth of current levels by 2035, leading to sea level rises and drought. Those predictions used ground-based measurements, whereas the new study measured the effect of gravity on twin Nasa satellites to give an accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost. ‘The results in this region really . were a surprise,’ said Wahr. ‘One possible explanation is that previous . estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the . lower, more accessible glaciers in Asia and were extrapolated to infer . the behavior of higher glaciers.' 'But unlike the lower glaciers, many of . the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass, even in the . presence of atmospheric warming.’ ‘What is still not clear is how these . rates of melt may increase and how rapidly glaciers may shrink in the . coming decades,’ said Professor Pfeffer. ‘That makes it . hard to project into the future.’ Around the world, melting has been overestimated. Earth's glaciers and ice caps are . shedding roughly 150 billion tons of ice annually - up to 30 per cent lower . than predicted. 'It had been suggested by hard-green campaigners, and regrettably endorsed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the Himalayan glaciers might disappear by the year 2035, leading to imminent drought and starvation for billions, a claim since widely rubbished,' says Lewis Page of science site The Register. 'The new GRACE readings would seem to be further confirmation of that prediction's foolishness.' The research effort is the first comprehensive satellite study of the contribution of the world's melting glaciers and ice caps to global sea level rise . Overall, it indicates that melting adding roughly 0.4 millimeters annually, said CU-Boulder physics Professor John Wahr, who helped lead the study. The researchers used satellite . measurements taken with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or . GRACE,, to calculate that the world's . glaciers and ice caps had lost about 148 billion tons, or about 39 . cubic miles of ice annually from 2003 to 2010. Traditional estimates of Earth's ice . caps and glaciers have been made using ground-based measurements from . relatively few glaciers to infer what all of the unmonitored glaciers . around the world were doing, he said. Only a few hundred of the roughly 200,000 glaciers worldwide have been monitored for a decade or more. ‘The strength of GRACE is that it . sees everything in the system,’ said Wahr. ‘Even though we don't have . the resolution to look at individual glaciers, GRACE has proven to be an . exceptional tool.’ The total does not count . the mass from individual glacier and ice caps on the fringes of the . Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets -- roughly an additional 80 billion . tons. Lake Gray Glacier melting in a stream of blue water, Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, Chile: Scientists now believe that glaciers may be melting more slowly than predicted . Nasa's twin Grace satellites measured ice loss far more accurately than previous studies, which used ground-based estimates . ‘This is the first time anyone has . looked at all of the mass loss from all of Earth's glaciers and ice caps . with GRACE,’ said Wahr. ‘The Earth is losing an incredible amount of . ice to the oceans annually, and these new results will help us answer . important questions in terms of both sea rise and how the planet's cold . regions are responding to global change.’ A paper on the subject is being published in the Feb. 9 online edition of the journal Nature. Launched in 2002, two GRACE satellites whip around Earth in tandem 16 times a day at an altitude of about 300 miles, sensing subtle variations in Earth's mass and gravitational pull. Separated by roughly 135 miles, the satellites measure changes in Earth's gravity field caused by regional changes in the planet's mass, including ice sheets, oceans and water stored in the soil and in underground aquifers. A positive change in gravity during a satellite approach over Greenland, for example, tugs the lead GRACE satellite away from the trailing satellite, speeding it up and increasing the distance between the two. A sensitive ranging system allows researchers to measure the distance of the two satellites down to as small as 1 micron- about 1/100 the width of a human hair - and to calculate ice and water amounts from particular regions of interest around the globe using their gravity fields. ‘The total amount of ice lost to Earth's oceans from 2003 to 2010 would cover the entire United States in about 1 and one-half feet of water,’ said Wahr, also a fellow at the CU-headquartered Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. According to the GRACE data, total sea level rise from all land-based ice on Earth including Greenland and Antarctica was roughly 1.5 millimeters per year annually or about 12 millimeters, or one-half inch, from 2003 to 2010, said Wahr. The sea rise amount does include the expansion of water due to warming, which is the second key sea-rise component and is roughly equal to melt totals, he said. ‘One big question is how sea level rise is going to change in this century,’ said Pfeffer. ‘If we could understand the physics more completely and perfect numerical models to simulate all of the processes controlling sea level -- especially glacier and ice sheet changes -- we would have a much better means to make predictions. But we are not quite there yet.’","Himalayan glaciers lose 4 billion tons of ice annually - but were predicted to lose up to 50 .

One of the wills is of Private John Feeley who served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and died during the Battle of Arras in April 1917. Researchers discovered that he is the great-great-grandfather of musician Paolo Nutini. He left all of his property and effects to his wife, Annie, who lived until 1964. His will reads: 'In the event of my death, I give the whole of my property and effects to my wife Mrs Annie Feeley, 12 Barr St, Paisley.' The team at the National Records also found the will of Andrew Cox, the uncle of Dundee-born Hollywood actor Brian Cox, who featured in the Bourne films. Pte Cox was a rope-worker before the war, and served with the Highland Light Infantry. He was killed in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 aged 22. His body was never identified and like many unmarried soldiers, all of his belongings were passed to his mother, Elizabeth.

The new fitness testing, which will become compulsory in September, was brought in after recommendations made by Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary (file photo) The Winsor recommendations stated that all police should be made to take a ‘bleep’ test annually, with participants having to complete a 15-metre shuttle run in shorter and shorter periods, reaching level 5.4 – four shuttles at level five. Police with special responsibilities are expected to perform at higher levels, with dog handlers required to complete level 5.7 and those who handle firearms able to do level 7.6. Mr Winsor also recommended that from 2018 the tests should be made harder, using challenges based on the type of things an officer might face on duty, but this is being considered by the College of Policing in case it has a detrimental effect on women.

"Its hills and winding country roads make it one of our most idyllic counties – but they also make it one of the most dangerous for new, young drivers. Cumbria is the worst area in England for car accidents involving 17 to 19 year olds, research has revealed. Almost one in six crashes there – 15.8 per cent – that result in someone being hurt involve a teenage driver. Second is Cornwall, at 15.5 per cent. The RAC Foundation said that currently one in five young drivers will have an accident within six months of passing their test (file photo) Cumbria is the worst area in England for car accidents involving 17 to 19-year-olds, research has revealed . The only places in the UK more dangerous for recently qualified motorists are both in Wales – Dyfed-Powys, where 18.2 per cent of crashes involve a 17- to 19-year-old driver, and Gwent (17 per cent) – according to a report commissioned by the RAC Foundation. Overall almost one in eight (11.9 per cent) of all road casualties are hurt or killed in collisions involving a car driver aged 17 to 19. This is despite this age group making up only 1.5 per cent of licensed drivers. The proportion of casualties involving drivers aged 17-19 was highest in the Dyfed Powys area of Wales at almost one in five (18.2 per cent). This was followed by Gwent in Wales (17 per cent), Cumbria and North Wales (15.8 per cent), the northern and Grampian regions (15.7 per cent) and Cornwall (15.5 per cent). London had the smallest proportion (5.6 per cent). Covering the five years from 2008 to 2012, the survey work was commissioned by the RAC Foundation and carried out by transport research laboratory TRL. TRL also made a conservative estimate of what the reduction in casualties would be in each area if a system of graduated driving licensing (GDL) was introduced. Among other possible requirements (like a minimum learner period and lower alcohol limit for new drivers), GDL schemes typically place temporary restrictions on newly-qualified young drivers in the first few months after they pass their tests. Almost one in six crashes there ¿ 15.8 per cent ¿ that result in someone being hurt involve a teenage driver (file photo) These restrictions can include a limit on the number of young passengers they can carry and a late-night curfew. The aim of GDL is to limit young drivers' exposure to risk until they have gained experience. Based on the experience of other countries where GDL is in operation, TRL concluded that across Britain about 4,500 fewer people would be hurt in an average year. This includes about 430 people who would otherwise have been killed or seriously injured. The RAC Foundation said that currently one in five young drivers will have an accident within six months of passing their test. Novice young drivers are at particular risk because of both their lack of experience (which affects new drivers of all ages to some degree) and the biological and behavioural characteristics of youth. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘Whichever way you cut it young drivers pose a significant and disproportionate risk to themselves and to others and it is in rural areas where the casualty rate is highest. ‘The Government has repeatedly delayed announcing its strategy to help reduce young driver accidents but here is yet another piece of evidence which shows graduated licensing can significantly cut death and injury.’ He went on: ‘The frustration is that while ministers here prevaricate, action is being taken just across the Irish Sea. Earlier this month a bill was put before the Northern Ireland Assembly which proposes the introduction of many of the measures this Government appears to have ruled out. ‘We should all have an interest in preserving young drivers' lives rather than exposing them to undue risk at the stage of their driving careers where they are most vulnerable. This is about ensuring their long-term safety and mobility. Not curtailing it.’","The only places in the UK more dangerous .

The video was taken on May 18 and purports to show a young man crossing a street in Moscow and narrowly miss being hit by a car. In a fury, he throws a drink at the vehicle and swears at its driver. Scroll down for video. The young man on the zebra crossing remonstrates as the car is obviously not going to stop . And indeed it illegally runs the zebra crossing. The unamused young man throws his drink at the vehicle, which stops abruptly . The occupants of the car get out and the young man makes his point rather than running away . The car screeches to a halt before three men get out, rush up to the pedestrian, grab him and hurl him into the boot and drive off. The whole scene was captured on video by the dashboard camera of Artem Mailov, 22. He said: ‘The police have quizzed me time and time again about this, asking whether I thought it was genuine or a stunt. They asked why I uploaded it to the internet. ‘All I can say is that it looked like it was the real deal and, no, I was not in on the kidnapping. I had no time to react. It was all over very quickly. I pity the poor guy who was bundled into the boot because the guys who took him looked big and menacing.’ The man in the vest and rather too tight shorts grabs the young man and forces him to the floor. The man in the white T-shirt and the one in the Adidas top look on . The other two men look initially bemused as their friend grabs the young man but then decide to join in . Then getting in on the 'action', one opens the boot while the others bundle the young man inside . After mistakenly putting the car into reverse, the driver shoots off up the road with Artem Mailov, 22, continuing to film the 'incident' A police spokesman said: ‘We have to take it seriously as a potential crime and are now appealing to social media users to ask if they can identify either the men or the car or the victim. ‘The only reservation we have is that the video seems too perfect and that it might have been a set up. We won't know that until all our enquiries have been exhausted.’ Mr Mailov added: ‘I think it's real, I hope the police find him – and in one piece.'","Video purports to show a young man crossing a street in Moscow .

Captain Joe and Son’s Lobster Company owner Joey Ciaramitaro posted pictures of the beast to the Good Morning Gloucester blog Friday afternoon. Very unusual: This four-clawed lobster was caught last weekend by a commercial fisherman out of Gloucester, Massachusetts . Pictures show the sea beast with an unusual four pincers, but it is otherwise normal. Gloucester is one of New England’s busiest fishing ports, and Captain Joe and Sons has been in business for 61 years, according to NECN. That smarts!: This lobster would pinch first and ask questions later . The four-clawed creature has nothing on a few other bizarre catches. Just last year, Gloucester fisherman Lou Williams, skipper of The Pretty Girl, netted a 20-pound lobster with claws bigger than a human face. He told WBZ that he released it back into the wild after posing for a few pictures. A 21-pound lobster was captured off the shores of summer vacation hot spot Cape Cod the prior year, the station noted. The prize for biggest lobster, though, goes to a 37.4-pound beast also caught off the coast of Cape Cod, according to the Massachusetts Lobstermans Association. In October 2012, a half black, half orange lobster was caught the week before Halloween by a fisherman from nearby Salem. It too was donated to an aquarium, according to the station. The award for most claws goes to a six-clawed lobster snared off the coast of Maine, a state famous for the prized crustacean. It was donated to an aquarium, according to WBZ.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A tourism boss has told of her dismay at the return of a real-life Basil Fawlty to TV screens this summer. Hapless Mark Jenkins was the star of the series The Hotel, which showed his eccentric leadership of a hotel in Torquay – the setting for John Cleese’s legendary comedy character. His flamboyant and bizarre antics at The Grosvenor Hotel were watched by an average of 2.8 million people when the fly-on-the-wall programme aired on Channel 4 over three series. The re-emergence of Mark Jenkins in a fourth series of The Hotel fills Carolyn Custerson, the chairman of VisitDevon, with dread. She certainly does not believe that all publicity is good publicity . But now the local tourism chief is annoyed at the news that the cameras are back to film a fourth series - this time with Mr Jenkins as an entertainments manager at the rival Cavendish Hotel. Carolyn Custerson, the chief executive of the English Riviera Tourism Company and chairman of VisitDevon said: ‘I am personally disappointed to hear that Channel 4 are making another series of The Hotel this summer in Torquay. ‘In my professional opinion I believe that the programme to date has portrayed Torquay hotel standards in an unbalanced way which is unhelpful, particularly when Torquay has just been voted the top seaside destination in the country by Trip Advisor’s Travellers' Choice Awards. Basil gives the car one last chance to start before he threatens to thrash it to within an inch of its life as Gourmet Night goes horribly wrong . ‘I have never believed in all publicity being good publicity.’ Although The Cavendish has confirmed it has signed the deal with Channel 4, the hotel’s owners have been sworn to secrecy and declined to comment on the individual characters. Manager Richard Blagden said: ‘Contracts were exchanged this week. We weren’t allowed to talk about it until then. ‘They are coming in July. I think they will be here for six weeks.’ You can't get the staff: Basil is exasperated by Manuel, the Spanish waiter who knows nothing . How to win friends and influence people: Basil does his level best to amuse the German guests at his hotel . He added: ‘This will, hopefully, be good for business. Anything that puts Torbay on the map is good news. ‘The show will probably be screened next January, so we will hopefully get a boost early season next year. ‘We have already started to get more bookings since word got out.’ The Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay Devon, the hotel which inspired Fawlty Towers.

"By . Kevin Donald . A family has been torn apart after a woman agreed to have a baby for her own mother and then backed out of the surrogacy arrangement while pregnant. Leanne Stanford originally made the extraordinary offer after her mother Judith Roberts miscarried the IVF baby she was expecting with her new husband at 21 weeks. It was while leaving hospital that Miss Stanford told her mother: ‘If you want to try again I’ll help you. I’ll be a surrogate for you if you want me to.’ Leanne Stanford, with baby Mollie, who is 18 months. Ms Stanford gave birth Mollie after carrying the baby as a surrogate for her mother Judith Roberts . She became pregnant at the first attempt using sperm from her stepfather Mark Roberts – and gave her 50-year-old mother the news in a gift box with a card. Mrs Roberts was thrilled but her delight turned to dismay after the 26-year-old had second thoughts following a scan at mid-pregnancy. Miss Stanford, a single mother who has a four-year-old son from a previous relationship, consulted a solicitor and as the surrogacy agreement was never legally formalised she was free to back out and did so by sending a letter to her mother. She said: ‘What it came down to was that the bond with my baby was stronger than the bond with my mum.’ The baby, Mollie, was born in November 2012 weighing a healthy 8lb 11oz. Initially mother-of-four Mrs Roberts and her husband, 50, visited the baby they hoped would be with them. Mrs Roberts said she was desperate for a sibling for her seven-year-old daughter – the youngest of her four girls. But emotions became so strong that the relationship between mother and daughter broke down completely. Mrs Roberts is alleged to have texted a mutual friend: ‘Tell her she is dead to me.’ Leanne, right, with her mother Judith, left. Leanne's decision to keep the baby she was carrying for her mother has caused a bitter family feud . Mollie is now 18 months old and the saga has taken another twist with Miss Stanford pursuing care worker Mr Roberts for maintenance through the Child Support Agency. Miss Stanford said: ‘I have my daughter’s best interests at heart and I have to make sure she is being properly looked after.’ Yesterday Mrs Roberts, a cleaner, refused to speak in detail, but said: ‘She doesn’t want anything to do with us. She doesn’t let us see the children.’ Mrs Roberts had no direct genetic connection to the baby as her egg was not used in a DIY process carried out at home. Miss Stanford, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, appears to have infuriated her mother even further by going public and selling her story to a newspaper. She told The Mirror: ‘This has caused a split between myself and my mum that can never be healed. ‘But every time I look at my beautiful little girl and feel that surge of love for her I know I made the right decision.’ She said of the offer she made to her mother: ‘It was a spur of the moment offer made at a time of high emotion. But I meant it, I really wanted to help them.’ However, in time she began to bond with the unborn child and concluded that she ‘ just couldn’t hand over my baby to mum’.","Leanne Stanford agreed to become pregnant as a surrogate for her mother .

Drivers watched in horror as they saw the lorry with the sheep's head crushed between the heavy top meant to prevent animals from falling out. The farmer was eventually flagged down on the country road but it was too late for the sheep which died from strangulation. Horrific: Shocked motorists could only look on impotently as the witnessed the sheep, circled, being strangled to death after being trapped by the closing hydraulic roof . Government agriculture officials are now investigating the alleged animal cruelty in Pembrokeshire, West Wales. The photograph was taken by a member of an animal charity who was driving behind the cattle lorry. It caused outrage when it was posted on the Facebook page of the charity which works to protect horses. A spokesman for the group called VANAH said: 'It is very clear that the codes of conduct which regulate the movement of these animals were ignored. 'The driver loaded the vehicle with live sheep, and one somehow, got trapped in the door when it was closed. 'The sheep would not have survived very long due to the immense pressure of the closing of the ramp. 'It suffered considerable pain, hung there bleeding or suffocating or with a broken neck.' Campaign: Animal welfare groups have long campaigned for better conditions to be introduced for the transportation of livestock. (File photo) The sheep was one of hundreds in the cattle wagon being transported from a farm for sale at a market in West Wales. The interior of the transporter has three different levels to load in as many sheep as possible.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Poppy sellers are to be given ‘minders’ after the collectors were subject to a string of vile attacks last year. In an unprecedented move, teenage volunteers will be chaperoned as they raise money for the Royal British Legion in Bradford. Last year there were a spate of assaults on those asking for the donations, which go to help the families of soldiers who have been injured or lost their lives. Protection: The Poppy Appeal collectors in Bradford will now be chaperoned after a string of attacks . Three young collectors were attacked in Bradford whilst raising money for the Poppy Appeal  - one of whom was just 13. This year the youngsters will be accompanied by older members of the Royal British Legion and ex Armed Forces. The Army is also going into at least one local school to talk to youngsters about the need to honour the fallen and overcome cultural barriers. Army cadet Bethany Holmes, then 13, was one of those attacked last year. She was spat at three times while collecting for the first time. Her mum Christine Holmes, 43, a teaching assistant, said: ‘She gave up her whole day and raised quite a bit of money. Appeal: Three young collectors have been attacked in Bradford while raising money for the British Legion . ‘She was not in uniform because she had only just become old enough to join the cadets but was with another lad who was in uniform. ‘Three Asian boys who were younger than her - about 11 or 12 - came up while she was stood outside a shopping centre. ‘One of them pinched a poppy from the box, turned his back to her, and spat on it unknown to her.’ Bethany ordered the boys to return the poppy and was appalled when she realised what they had done. ‘Then he tried to spit on another poppy and when she grabbed him he spat in her face,’ added mother-of-two Mrs Holmes. ‘She was very upset by what happened at the time and we got a letter from the Royal British Legion saying how sorry they were - and how horrified. ‘She was out there from 9.30 in the morning until five o’clock and this was her reward. ‘It happened 15 minutes before I came to pick her up. ‘So I think providing chaperones is a good idea - but it is also a sad sign of the times.’ The incident was reported to police but Mrs Holmes said none of the yobs was ever traced. Mrs Holmes works a multi-cultural school - Belle Vue Boys’ School in Bradford - and said the Army was coming in to explain the importance of Remembrance Sunday. ‘They will be giving a talk explaining that everyone was involved in the war and the boys should appreciate that and be respectful,’ she said. As a result the local branch of the Legion has accepted an offer to provide personal protection to its younger collectors. Bethany, now 14, has now put the incident behind her and is determined to do her bit for Allerton Army Cadet Force. ‘I just don’t want any fuss,’ she said yesterday. ‘I am independent. It might be a good idea but I do not want this.’ In separate incidents last year yobs also hurled abuse at two Asian girl cadets and two other sellers were sworn at in the city centre. One young poppy seller had her tin grabbed from her shoulder. Grandmother Barbara Allsopp, Poppy Appeal organiser for the Bradford Royal British Legion branch for 13 years, said it had never happened before. Fears that young collectors, aged from ten to 17, could be too frightened to take part this year prompted the Royal British Legion’s Riders branch to offer their services as chaperones. The Riders is a branch of the British Legion and was set up in 2004. Concerned: The British Legion now fears young collectors will be put off . Its members are all ex-forces motorcycle enthusiasts who wanted to support the poppy appeal and include riders of all ages from youth members to veterans in their 80s. The West Yorkshire branch of the Riders will follow the youngsters around during their collections. Mrs Allsopp said: ‘It is something we need and it’s ideal because it would keep the cadets safe.’ Riders West Yorkshire official Rod Walker said: ‘After what happened last year we thought our job should be to support the branches. ‘You have to remember the cadets who are affected by this are very impressionable and in some cases they will turn out to be our future Armed Forces. ‘We have to educate the public why we are doing these collections.’ Lord Mayor of Bradford Dale Smith said it was a ‘sad reflection’ that some youngsters were targeted by mindless thugs last year. ‘There are numerous events on November 11 to commemorate the fallen,’ he said. ‘We are strong supporters of the appeal. 'It deals with the past and present generations of service men and women who are always in our minds. ‘It is very important the younger generation are continually reminded - and it is a sad reflection that this small minority did abuse some of the younger collectors last year. ‘I welcome that the motorcycle section will be keeping a watchful eye - but hope their services will not be needed.’","One, a 13 year old girl, was spat at while she stood outside a shopping centre .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sheriff's deputies who showed up at Elliot Rodger's doorstep last month to check on his mental health hadn't seen online videos in which he threatens suicide and violence even though those recordings were what prompted his parents to call authorities.

'I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you,' the son of a Hollywood director who worked on The Hunger Games says. In . his videos and writings, Rodger voices his contempt for everyone from . his roommates to the human race, reserving special hate for two groups: . the women he says kept him a virgin for all of his 22 years and the men . they chose instead. At least two other people who saw Rodger's videos before Friday compared him to a serial killer, through a message board on a bodybuilding website and the social network Reddit. The rampage played out largely as he sketched it in public postings. He . said he would start by 'silently killing as many people as I can around . Isla Vista by luring them into my apartment through some form of . trickery.' He said he would knock them out with a hammer, and slit their throats. On . Sunday, the sheriff's office identified the final victims as Cheng Yuan . Hong, 20, and George Chen, 19 - both from San Jose - and Weihan Wang, . 20, of Fremont. Hong . and Chen were listed on the lease as Rodger's roommates. Investigators . were trying to determine whether Wang was a roommate or was visiting the . apartment. Around 9.30pm, the shooting rampage began and lasted about 10 minutes. In . the end, he shot and killed three others at random and injured 13 more . either with gunshots or the BMW that he used as a battering ram against . bicyclists and skateboarders. Deputies found three semi-automatic handguns along with 400 unspent rounds in the car. All were purchased legally. It . was a series of social media posts referencing suicide and murder that . triggered their concerns, according to family spokesman Alan Shifman. Upon . arriving at Rodger's apartment, authorities said he dismissed the . situation as a misunderstanding and claimed he had no intention of . hurting himself or anyone else. 'He was articulate. He was polite. He was timid,' Brown said. His behavior also failed to 'meet the criteria for an involuntary hold.' Patty Ritter, 21, from left, Rachel Keever, 22, and Craig Schaffer, 20, stop in front of a makeshift memorial at the Alpha Phi sorority house where two women were killed as part of Friday night's mass shooting . Rodger later wrote that he was terrified the deputies were only moments from discovering his plans. 'If they had demanded . to search my room ... (t)hat would have ended everything,' he wrote. 'For a few . horrible seconds I thought it was all over.' From . then on, he kept at least one gun and a few loaded magazines near him . at all times so that if police did return he could shoot at them and get . away. 'Thankfully, all suspicion of me was dropped after I took down . the videos from Youtube, and the police never came back,' he wrote. 'It was all because of . the videos. I must have expressed too much anger in them,' he added. 'I immediately . took most of them off of Youtube, and planned to re-upload them a few . days before the Day of Retribution.'","Rodger wrote that he was terrified police would derail his homicidal plot .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . The Duchess of Cambridge sparked a rush in the sales of swaddling blankets after she was pictured with one wrapped around baby Prince George of Cambridge as they left hospital. Now a former nurse and birth doula has said these mothers will have happy and contented babies - if they learn how to use them. Viv Rogan, dubbed the Baby Calmer, said: 'Since Kate was seen with a swaddling blanket more people have been buying them but now they need to know how to use them properly. It's more than just a blanket. If folded correctly it can transform a screaming baby into a calm one in three minutes.' Cry baby solution: Swaddling can soothe a distressed newborn according to Dr Harvey Karp . Swaddling is one of the techniques Viv recommends to new mothers as she teaches the parenting practices recommended by America's Dr Harvey Karp. He said babies can be soothed by following what he calls the 'Five S's' - . swaddling, putting them in a side-on position, . making shushing sounds, swinging them and giving them a dummy to . suck. Dr Karp's advice in based on his belief that babies aged 0 to three months are in the 'fourth trimester' and can be best settled into the world by being in an environment similar to how they were in the womb. His 'The Happiest Baby' advice has been widely followed in the U.S. and now Viv, from Wimbledon, is spreading the word in the UK after becoming one of a handful of credited instructors in Dr Karp's baby calming techniques. The baby calmer: Viv Rogan teaches Dr Karp's 'five S's' technique in the UK . A mother of three grown-up boys, Viv said she wishes she had known the methods sooner as it would have made her life easier when her sons were newborns. She said: 'It is tempting to think that someone who can calm a baby easily has a special gift but it has nothing to do with talent and everything to do with understanding why restless babies cry.' She said all of Dr Karp's advise is based on 'tried and tested methods' and 'ancient techniques' such as swaddling. Swaddling goes back to Biblical times but has died out in recent generations in Britain as women no longer know how to due it - or fear causing hip displacement in their babies by doing them too tightly (a problem Viv said isn't relevant if you wrap the baby so their hips still have room to move). Ancient technique: Viv shows a new mother how to correctly swaddle her baby . It's a wrap: Swaddling replicates how babies felt curled up in the womb but they mustn't be bound too tightly . She gets her clients to first practise swaddling on dolls so they can get the technique right before wrapping their baby. She said a swaddled baby will sleep longer during the night and, if swaddled at certain periods during the day, will settle easier and some very restless babies will latch on with more ease if swaddled,  though skin-to-skin feeding is still the ideal. She explained that the method works by replicating how the babies were in the womb when they were comfortably curled up. In the current heatwave, she said mothers needn't have their babies swaddled for long periods. To avoid them overheating, she said they should be swaddled without any clothes but just wearing a nappy. Parents should always be sure to check the baby is not too hot. Does she know how to use it? The Duchess of Cambridge had a swaddling shawl around baby Prince George of Cambridge when she left hospital . She said the many parents she has advised have seen huge improvements in their baby's temperament after being swaddled. She said: 'It has become a party trick for one of my client's husbands. He went to a friend's Christening where all the babies were crying and upset and he calmed them by swaddling each one.' But Viv says if put down to sleep babies must always be put on their backs and the swaddled must be secure.Swaddling should be discontinued when the baby is able to turn over in its cot. Viv added that the shushing noises are also key to a happy baby. She said: 'Babies are not used to complete peace and quiet. They have been in the womb where they could hear shushing noises and the sounds of their mother's body.' Parents can replicate this by playing 'white noise' to get their baby to sleep.

"By . Katy Winter . The onesie phenomenon took over the fashion charts in 2012, and now couples can double up and snuggle up this Valentine’s Day as George at Asda launches the latest in casualwear innovation: ‘The Twosie.’ Comprising of 10 metres of fabric, four arms, two hoods and featuring a bunny inspired design, the 'twosie' - a fashion first as far as we are aware - means that the nation’s love bunnies can snuggle up together in comfort. This year a staggering 92 per cent of couples are planning to shun the traditional candle-lit restaurant dinner on the 14th in favour of staying in and cuddling up in each others company, according to a survey by the supermarket brand. One becomes two! George at Asda has developed the Twosie for couples who want to be ultra close (and cute) Love bunnies: The twosie has a rabbit design-complete with ears- and has the words Love Bunnies across the back . The survey also found that two thirds of women claim that they would rather receive a simple . or novelty gift than an expensive or elaborate present, to help battle . financial stresses this year. George at Asda created the twosie following unprecedented customer demand for a onesie made for two. Today 100 limited edition ‘Twosies’ will be available to buy online. In the run up to Christmas, George at Asda sold over one . million onesies, and even opened a dedicated onesie store to keep up with demand. Some think they are adorable, others the height of naff. At least the twosie is a tad more practical featuring a cape design rather than the legs that most all-in-ones feature, allowing you and your partner to be snuggled close, while still giving you a little bit of freedom. Exclusive: Despite expecting high demand, ASDA will only be creating 100 of the innovative Twosies . Celebrity fans of the onesie include model Cara Delvigne as well as boy band sensation . One Direction and singer Miley Cyrus, who all love to share snaps of themselves . looking cute and cosy in all-in-one numbers. Fiona Lambert, George Brand Director commented: ‘The onesie was a phenomenon that swept the nation in 2012. 'Demand from customers for more onesie innovation was through the roof and what a perfect way to move on but with the ‘Twosie.’ 'We . expect it to be an instant sell out and 100 lucky couples will be able . to get their hands on them from today for that special day.'

Bystanders said they were waving their warrant cards at him but he refused to let them board the mid-evening service because they were so drunk. Causing a scene: Passengers watched the off-duty pair grapple with the uniformed official on a packed platform at Euston Station, in Central London . The Midlands-bound train was held up for 10 minutes as officers from British Transport Police (BTP) were called and took the women away. One witness, a 46-year-old company managing director, said: ‘I was at the barrier getting my ticket checked when two women came along who were completely paralytic. ‘One collapsed on the floor and her friend pulled her up. I could see them flashing their warrant cards and saying they were police officers. Arrested: The train was held up for 10 minutes as officers from British Transport Police were called . ‘The guard said they could not get on and they started screaming and shouting at him. He tried to walk away and they grabbed him by the shoulders and arms and shook him. ‘They grappled with him and stopped him getting away. Everyone watching from the first class carriage could not believe it. ‘Most people thought he was assaulted by members of the public, but I knew they were police officers. ‘It just seems ridiculous that police are so keen on jumping on other people when they are drunk but they cannot behave themselves in such a public place.’ The incident took place on platform one at Euston Station last Wednesday before the departure of the 9.43pm Wolverhampton service. One of the women, Islington PC Debra Mackrell, 37, of Milton Keynes, was later charged with common assault. She was commended by her borough commander last year for catching a suicidal woman after she jumped from a window. Her friend, a 27-year-old PC from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly and has been released on bail. All Metropolitan Police officers receive free rail travel on London Tube trains and buses whether they are on or off duty. Officers get free travel to destinations within 70 miles of the capital if they pay the monthly tax liability of either £48 or £96, depending on their salary. Virgin Trains said the train guard was shaken but not injured by the incident and was able to continue working. The Metropolitan Police said both officers have been placed on restricted duties away from the frontline. British Transport Police (BTP) said Mackrell will appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday July 20. Following an adjournment, the CPS have now withdrawn the charges against Ms Mackrell.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The once iconic MP3 player that cemented Apple's place in music history - and ultimately brought about the demise of Sony's Walkman - is facing its own inevitable death. According to the latest earnings report, Apple sold 6million iPods during last quarter, and although this was almost double the sales of the previous three months, this equated to a 52 per cent drop in sales year-on-year. Apple also lost 55 per cent in revenue on all models of the music player, compared to the previous year, and the iPod now makes up just 2 per cent of the company's overall income. Apple sold 6million iPods, including the fifth-generation iPod touch pictured, last quarter. The music player now makes up just 2 per cent of Apple's overall income. This equates to a 52% drop in sales year-on-year, and a 55% drop in revenue . The drop in sales is being attributed to the increase in music apps, cloud storage and streaming services including Spotify. Additionally, Apple iPhones come with iTunes built-in, making the iPod redundant for many iPhone owners. The trend hasn't been helped by the fact Apple hasn't released a new version of the music player since the fifth-generation Touch and seventh-generation Nano launched in 2012. Sales of iPods were at their highest during 2008 following the launch of the first iPod Touch at the end of 2007. The iPod Touch was designed to look like an iPhone, played music and ran apps, but could not make calls. Similar sales were seen across 2009 thanks to the launch of the third-generation Shuffle, fourth-generation Nano and second-generation Touch.

"By . Jo Knowsley . and Sophie Jane Evans . Pressure: Motorists are being handed unjust and illegal parking tickets by traffic wardens battling to meet targets, according to an investigation . Motorists are being persecuted with unjust and illegal parking tickets issued by traffic wardens battling to meet targets and terrified of losing their jobs, according to an undercover investigation. The report for BBC1’s Inside Out London features interviews with wardens in the boroughs of Ealing and Camden, some of whom admit fabricating ‘evidence’. Dirty tactics include issuing tickets in a loading bay after five minutes instead of 20, making up records of discussions with motorists in pocket books and falsifying photographic evidence. One unidentified warden said: ‘Supervisors have a definite expectation of the numbers required. The pressure to issue tickets makes the job demoralising and depressing.’ Wardens who missed targets claimed they were penalised by not being allocated overtime or having holiday leave refused. Others said it had been implied that if numbers fell too sharply they could lose their jobs. Both councils said the number of tickets being issued is falling. However, figures released by car insurance company LV have shown that motorists are being stung by almost 900,000 parking fines a month at a cost of £30million - a 4 per cent increase on the previous year. And tickets issued on Sundays have increased by 13 per cent – with nearly 300,000 tickets issued on that day of the week in the first five months of 2013. The AA have said some traffic wardens had even 'targeted church-goers and choristers'. Today, it was revealed that a man had been hit with a £70 parking fine after pulling over for just seven seconds to drop off his elderly mother-in-law. Ian Hardman, 58, fell foul of a council-run spy car in Bolton when he stopped in an empty taxi rank to let 82-year-old Audrey Harrison out. 'Spy car': The vehicles, which are fitted with CCTV cameras, have been called council 'cash cows' by critics . He later received a letter from Bolton Council, giving him 28 days to pay the fine – which works out as £10 for every second of his good deed. Local shopkeepers near the layby in . Knowsley Street said the council's camera car, which films from inside a . small Toyota IQ car and has been labelled a 'cash cow' by critics, has . been located at the layby for weeks trying to catch out motorists.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Nick Mcdermott . Three Kenyans tortured by the British colonial authorities during the Mau Mau uprising can pursue their claims for compensation against the Government. The landmark decision to allow the elderly trio to seek damages more than 50 years after the bloody conflict follows an earlier admission by the Foreign Office that atrocities had been carried out ‘at the hands of the colonial administration’. The judgment – which was celebrated by Mau Mau veterans in the streets of Nairobi yesterday – opens the door to thousands of claims relating to alleged abuse in Kenya and other former colonies, which could cost Britain millions to resolve. Scroll down for video . Kenyans Jane Muthoni Mara, left, Wambuga Wa Nyingi, and Paulo Muoka Nzili, right, celebrate the announcement last October of a legal decision in their case at Britain's High Court . Wambuga Wa Nyingi, left, Paulo Muoka Nzili and Jane Muthoni Mara, right, claim they were victims of torture during the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s . The High Court yesterday rejected the Government’s claim that too much time had elapsed for there to be a fair trial, with Mr Justice McCombe finding the three Kenyans had ‘arguable cases in law’. The ruling means the case will now go to a full trial, pending an appeal by the Foreign Office, which said the judgment had ‘potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications’. Alternatively, the Government could opt to settle the claims and pay damages. According to their legal team, Wambugu Wa Nyingi, 84, Paulo Muoka Nzili, 85, and Jane Muthoni Mara, 73, were subjected to ‘appalling abuse’, including castration, beatings and sexual assaults. Yesterday’s ruling, which came after a three-year legal battle, was hailed as ‘historic’ by their lawyers. The British government has responded by . expressing its disappointment with the decision, although it stressed . that it did 'not dispute that each of the claimants in this case . suffered torture and other ill treatment at the hands of the colonial . administration.' After the news broke today that the . claims could proceed to trial, solicitors Leigh Day & Co said has . warned the Government could face potentially thousands of claims from . Kenyans who suffered similar torture. Senior partner Martyn Day said: 'This is . a historic judgment which will reverberate around the world and will . have repercussions for years to come. 'Following this judgment, we can but . hope that our Government will at last do the honourable thing and sit . down and resolve these claims. 'There will undoubtedly be victims of colonial torture, from Malaya to the Yemen, from Cyprus to Palestine, who will be reading this judgment with great care.' The government had sought to have the case dismissed, arguing it could not be held legally responsible for the long-ago abuses and a Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) spokesman has stated it would appeal. The FCO spokesman said: 'The British Government is disappointed with today's judgment. The judgment was not a finding of liability but a procedural decision following a preliminary hearing on limitation, which allows the cases to go to a full trial. Celebration: Kenyan Mau Mau war veterans and their supporters show their joy after the announcement . 'The judgment has potentially significant and far-reaching legal implications. The normal time limit for bringing a civil action is three to six years. In this case, that period has been extended to over 50 years despite the fact that the key decision makers are dead and unable to give their account of what happened.' Although disappointed with the decision and reiterating the decision to appeal, the spokesman told of the British Government's close relationship with Kenya and its people. 'Since this is an important legal issue, we have taken the decision to appeal. In light of the legal proceedings it would not be appropriate for the Government to comment any further on the detail of the case. Law and order: Martyn Day predicts the decision will have repercussions around the world for many years to come . 'At the same time, we do not dispute that each of the claimants in this case suffered torture and other ill treatment at the hands of the colonial administration. 'We have always said that we understand the pain and grievance felt by those, on all sides, who were involved in the divisive and bloody events of the emergency period in Kenya, and it is right that those who feel they have a case are free to take it to the courts. 'Our relationship with Kenya and its people has moved on since the emergency period. We are now partners and the UK is not only one of the largest bilateral donors in Kenya, but also Kenya's biggest cumulative investor, and a key partner on security and other issues of benefit to both countries. Our people-to-people ties are and will remain strong and deep.' In his ruling, the judge said there was 'an amply sufficient documentary base' to test what was known in London about excessive use of force in the camps throughout the period of the emergency, and what London's reaction to that knowledge was. 'On the basis of that material, if necessary supplemented by the witness evidence that is likely still to be available - either in statements or orally in court - I am satisfied that a fair trial of any question of breach of duty in respect of each of the surviving claimants is possible. 'Looking at those claimants' evidence, I think that it will be quite possible to determine sufficiently clearly where and when they suffered their injuries and the official status of those responsible for inflicting them. 'It will also be possible, on the documents arranged and collated chronologically, together with the other evidence, to determine whether or not the injuries occurred because of a breach of duty on the part of the United Kingdom government.' When giving his ruling last year, the judge emphasised that he had not found there was systematic torture in the Kenyan camps nor that, if there was, the UK Government was liable to detainees, such as the claimants, for what happened.

"By . Emma Innes . A former soap actor has told how he transformed his body in just twelve weeks, losing 34lbs in weight and nine inches from his waist. Scott Wright – who played stripper Sam Kingston in Coronation Street – went from being a  ‘gut bucket’ to having his dream Men’s Health body by following a strict diet and doing short-burst, high-intensity workouts. He documented his weight loss in a series of pictures taken weekly as his body got more and more toned. Scroll down for video . Scott Wright - who played stripper Sam Kingston in Coronation Street - went from being a  'gut bucket' to having his dream Men's Health body by following a strict diet and doing short-burst, high-intensity workouts . The pictures show how he started off with a pot belly and transformed into a muscle man. Before getting into shape, Mr Wright would eat up to eight Kit Kat Chunky bars a day – with 218 calories in each bar, this meant he was eating 1,744 calories of chocolate a day. He decided to make changes to his lifestyle but even as he was pumping iron and working out daily at the gym, he admits there was the occasional lapse. Early on, he says that he cracked and ate two family-sized packs of McVities Chocolate Digestives in one 4,300 calorie binge. However, after that he knuckled down and lost 34lbs – going down from 14st 6lb to 12st – and his waist measurement went down from 37in to just 28in. Perhaps most startling of all was his reduction in body fat – from 23 per cent to just 3 per cent. He documented his weight loss in a series of pictures taken weekly as his body got more and more toned . The 38-year-old said: ‘I looked awful before I lost the weight. I was incredibly lethargic and completely ashamed of my man boobs and pot belly. ‘I had always been proud of my body and had worked as a fitness trainer keeping stars like Kerry Katona in shape. ‘But I had let myself go big-time. Chocolate was my big weakness and I would not think twice about scoffing eight Kit Kat Chunkys in a day. ‘I’d just eat one after another, nibbling off the chocolate first before scoffing the wafer. ‘It took its toll on my body and I ended up in the worst shape of my life.’ As . a result, at Easter, Mr Wright set himself task - get a body like a . model by the start of the summer and record the whole painful process in . a series of photographs. Mr Wright believes a key factor in his . body transformation was his daily use of Forza Supplements’ fat burning . and recovery pills - Garcinia-C diet capsules in particular. Now he has achieved his goal – and proudly showed off his new body. Mr Wright is pictured (left) just before he started his diet and exercise regime. He is pictured (right) at the end of the first month of the programme . He is pictured (left) after dieting for six weeks. He is also seen (right) at the end of the second month . He said: ‘I didn’t just want to look good, I wanted to look amazing. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I saw the pictures. I’d achieved all my goals and vowed that I would never get out of shape again. ‘I would have lost more weight but I’d bulked up with lots more muscle, which is heavier than fat.’ However, he admitted that it was tough cutting back on his chocolate intake. He said: ‘I started off determined to stick rigidly to an ultra-low sugar and low fat diet. ‘I tried this approach for five days . after which I caved in and smashed two family-sized packs of McVities . Chocolate Digestives. Mr Wright (pictured in Coronation Street in 2000) has now lost 34lbs - going down from 14st 6lb to 12st - and reduced his waist measurement from 37in to just 28in. He believes in that taking daily fat burning and recovery pills by Forza supplements also helped . ‘It was a case of going straight back to the drawing board. ‘I can be incredibly weak-willed. My . mind plays tricks on me and I have a constant devil on my shoulder . telling me to do the wrong thing, “Eat this, drink that”.’ After this setback, Mr Wright stuck rigidly to a diet regime – he did two 20 minutes high intensity workouts during the week, before and after work, and ate carefully before taking a more relaxed approach at weekends. He explained: ‘I knew I needed a slightly more realistic regime. ‘I have literally had to nurse myself through this whole thing and treat myself like an adult teaching a naughty child. Before getting into shape, Mr Wright would eat up to eight Kit Kat Chunky bars a day - with 218 calories in each bar, this meant he was eating 1,744 calories of chocolate a day . ‘I . would eat a fairly strict diet throughout the week and then not put . pressure on myself at weekends. If I wanted to eat crap, I would. If I . did eat crap, I had to go to the gym or a run afterwards. ‘The key point for me was not to feel hungry. That is when I would reach for the chocolate in the past. ‘What worked for me was cutting my carbohydrate intake right down after noon and replacing it with a slightly higher fat intake – whole eggs and fattier cuts of meat. ‘I made sure I had my fruit and natural sugars in the mornings and I always ate greens a few times a day. ‘Added to this, I drank as much water as possible – between three and four litres daily, and I didn’t leave more than three hours between meals.’","Scott Wright, a former Coronation Street actor, wanted the body of a model .

Motorists are wasting nearly £1/2million a year on 'daft' and unnecessary MoT test failures, a new report reveals. It says drivers are allowing their car to fail its first MoT test 'for the most ridiculous reasons' including failing to clear out clutter and plastering stickers on the windscreen. Research by Whatcar.com shows that nearly 1 in 25 (4 per cent) of the 285,236 MoT test failures recorded between August 2012 and August 2013 were on cars having their first test and so could have been easily avoided. More than 4,600 cars failed because owners had not topped up the screen-wash, and nearly 2,900 failed due to the car being dirty and full of clutter. It advises: 'Clear the mess from the boot and cabin and give the windows and mirrors a quick wipe'. Nearly 1,400 MOT failures were down to 'anomalies' with the registration plate - particularly personalised plates - including incorrect fonts, irregular character spacings, and dirty or missing letters and plates. What Car? says: 'If you have a personalised plate, make sure it adheres to DVLA rules.' Some 1,055 cars failed because of stickers on windscreen blocking the driver's view. The report urges: ' Keep any windscreen furniture, including tax disc and parking permits, strictly outside the area of the wipers' sweep' And nearly 800 failed because of a warning light displaying on the dashboard. What car? notes: 'Warning lights have been part of the MoT test since 2012 and relate to anything from brakes to tyre pressures and airbag. If you see one, get it checked out'. Don't scrap it: Nearly 1,400 of mistakes were down to anomalies with registration plates. such as personalised plates and dirty or missing letters on the plates . With an average MoT test price of £45, the 10,753 cars which failed their first test amounts to £483,885 wasted by UK motorists. The magazine has launched a new website www.whatcar.com/mot designed to help drivers boost their car's chances of passing its first MoT test. Overall, the most common reasons overall for MoT failure are tyre tread depth being below the 1.6mm limit, brake-pads being worn down to less than 1.5mm thick and headlamps being wrongly aimed.","Easy-to-fix mistakes leading to MoT failures cost us £500,000 a year .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Amazon is set to take on the big supermarkets with the launch of a fresh food home delivery service in the UK. The company already offers the AmazonFresh service in Seattle, and is now rolling it out to other US cities. According to industry experts, the next step will be to bring it to the UK and Europe. At the moment, the retailer sells long-life grocery items such as tea, cereals, pasta and herbs through its UK website, but the AmazonFresh service extends this to a full range of fresh and frozen foods. Expanding empire: Amazon's 'fulfilment centres' could soon add groceries to the firm's list of products . Charles Wilson, chief executive of food wholesaler Booker, said the US retailer is powerful enough to challenge supermarket giants such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Mr Wilson added: ‘These online players have huge financial strength to take growth away from the traditional supermarkets.’ In the US, shoppers who place an order by 10am get a delivery from one of Amazon’s green vans in time for dinner. Delivery is free for those spending more than $35 (£22), but customers must be members of Amazon Prime, which comes with an annual fee of $300 (£190). Doug Gurr, vice-president of Amazon UK, previously ran Asda’s food home shopping service. He has hinted at the expansion of AmazonFresh, saying: ‘We have just started rolling that out across America. ‘Our model tends to be to take something and to try really hard to make it work and then, when we think we have got it right, start rolling it out.’ Popular: Amazon and similar websites have already been blamed for the decline of high street shopping .","Internet company already offers the AmazonFresh service in Seattle .

"By . Alex Greig . The man behind the massive Beanie Babies craze in the mid-nineties is notoriously reclusive, but new court documents have revealed previously unknown details of his life.Ty Warner, 69, is the creator of Beanie Babies, a billionaire businessman who admitted evading taxes in a secret Swiss bank accounts.Documents filed by his lawyers in an attempt to reduce his sentence, to be handed down on January 14, serve as a fascinating biographies of one of the business world's most private personalities. Remorseful: Warner was escorted from a Chicago courthouse after pleading guilty to tax evasion in October . Tax evasion: New details have emerged about the life of Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner in court documents filed by his lawyers . Warner was born in Chicago and had a 'challenging' upbringing in an 'unhappy family and a youth devoid of educational advantages.' He was sent to a military school at the age of 15 and then began college at Kalamazoo College in 1962, but was forced to drop out because he couldn't afford his tuition. He tried to enroll in the military but was deemed unfit to serve due to hearing loss. Warner's mother was diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic, and he helped take care of her, taking on a series of odd jobs to make ends meet, including busboy, bellboy, and door-to-door encyclopedia salesman. A job as a salesman with Dakin, a company that produced stuffed toys and figurines, prompted Warner to form his own company, Ty Inc. Craze: During the height of the Beanie Baby fad there were queues and waiting lists for the limited edition toys . He launched the Beanie Baby in the early 1990s and the company went from a small business run from his own home to a multi-billion-dollar company by the mid-1990s. Warner designed the toy to be small enough for kids to carry around in their pockets and cheap enough that they could afford to buy them with their own pocket money. As the company grew, he employed business executives, but 'treated the final decision about the particular fabric or color of the company’s next Beanie Baby as a non-delegable assignment.' The document contains summaries of letters sent by friends, acquaintances and employees of Warner in support of him, describing 'spontaneous acts of generosity,' including paying for college tuition, operations and unlimited leave for employees with sick family members. Secretive: Warner shakes hands in a rare appearance to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Beanie Babies toy line at the American International Toy Fair February 16, 2003 in New York . Warner is well-known for his philanthropy, particularly to children's charities. According to the document, Warner has paid approximately $1 billion income tax over his lifetime. Warner's lawyers say the businessman was counseled by Swiss financial advisers to open accounts in the country for the 'safekeeping' of some of his assets. He apparently tried to come forward to disclose his assets to the IRS but was not permitted to the IRS's disclosure program, which would have enabled him to avoid prosecution. Philanthropist: Warner is well-known for his generosity to employees, friends and strangers alike . Pushing for a sentence of probation rather than jail time, the documents says the judge 'should keep in mind the Supreme Court’s admonition that “the punishment should fit the offender and not merely the crime.' By the time he is due to be sentenced, his lawyers say, Warner will have complied with all terms, including paying a $53 million Foreign Bank Account Report penalty and at least $16 million in back taxes and interest. The mystique of Beanie Babies remains today. The reclusive toymaker's creations are still going for big prices on eBay, with a 1996 Beanie Baby Peace Bear up for auction beginning at $5,000.","Ty Warner, 69, created Beanie Babies in the early 1990s, building a billion-dollar fortune off the back of the plush toys .

Sainsbury's is currently testing the new Scan & Go app at stores in Tadley, Hants, Clerkenwell in central London and Bethnal Green, East London. It allows users to bag their shopping up as they walk around the store and pay for them at a self-checkout counter without having to unload. Trolley good show: Sainsbury's supermarket are testing a new app that allows you to scan and pay for your goods with your phone . The innovative programme even directs customers around the store according to the items on their shopping list potentially saving even more time. The customer logs in by scanning a Quick Response(QR) code, when they arrive. They then scan the QR codes on packaging or on the shelf next to the price information. Loose items like fruit and vegetables are weighed on scales, and a QR code is printed out which can be scanned by the app. Smart buy: Customers scan the QR codes on packaging or on the shelf next to the pricing information using their mobile phone camera .

"By . Daniel Martin . Rachel Reeves, a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet, warned Ed Miliband that he needed to do more than just come up with new policies - he needed to explain them too . The Labour Party descended into further turmoil yesterday as Ed Miliband came under attack for his failure to put an 'emotional case' to the voters. Rachel Reeves, a senior member of the Shadow Cabinet, warned her leader that he needed to do more than just come up with new policies - he needed to explain them too. Her comments came as one of Mr Miliband's key aides said Labour risked 'losing England' by its failure to listen to the electorate on issues including immigration and Europe. And backbench MPs lined up to call on him to end the 'sloganeering' and inject more 'passion' into his campaigning, saying the leadership faced 'big questions' over its ability to connect with voters. The scathing criticism follows Labour's disappointing performance in Thursday's local elections, finishing only slightly ahead of the Conservatives with 31 per cent of the vote – seven points below what Neil Kinnock achieved at the same point before he lost the 1992 election. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the performance was 'not good enough', while insiders said the strategy to concentrate the campaign on Mr Miliband - with other members of the cabinet 'shut out' - had failed disastrously. Experts warned a party in line to win next year's general election would have expected to do significantly better. And even before the election, Mr Miliband had a disastrous week, forgetting the name of a key candidate during an interview, having unflattering photos emerge of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich and not knowing how much his family spends on groceries. Last night Labour strategists were further braced for a disastrous second place in the European elections. Even William Hague managed to top the Euro poll against Tony Blair during his hapless period as Tory leader. Simon Danczuk, one of the party's most outspoken backbenchers, poked fun at Mr Miliband for his difficulties with a bacon sandwich (pictured) In another blow to Mr Miliband, a survey at the weekend showed a third of voters would be more likely to vote Labour if he was replaced, citing a lack of charisma and 'common touch' as their objections. Simon Danczuk, one of the party's most outspoken backbenchers, poked fun at Mr Miliband for his difficulties with a bacon sandwich, writing on Twitter that he had launched an 'easier-to-eat' bacon butty at his family's delicatessen in his Rochdale constituency. Mr Danczuk also said Ukip had stolen a march because it focused on a key voter concern – immigration. 'We've been too much about sloganeering and being on message, and I think a more passionate conversation with the electorate has done Ukip well,' he told Sky News's Murnaghan programme. Miss Reeves, Labour's work and pensions spokesman, said she agreed Labour had 'more work to do'. She said: 'We need to understand why people are voting for Ukip and make the emotional case as well as the policy case for why they should be voting Labour.' Frank Field, welfare minister in Mr Blair's government, said the party had 'the most mega lessons to learn'. He said the local election results 'pose big questions for the Labour leadership as a whole', and complained the party had been 'silent' on immigration, adding: 'Ukip poses a huge threat to us.' Lord Glasman, an academic described as Mr Miliband's mentor, also stuck the knife in, saying: 'It pains me to say this; I have come to the conclusion that Labour is in danger of losing England.' One shadow cabinet member told the Sunday Times of the Labour leader: 'It's not just that people think he is weird. They think he's a joke, and that's even more dangerous.' Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North, defended Mr Miliband's leadership, but conceded: 'No one is going to confuse Ed Miliband with George Clooney any time soon.' Last night Alan Johnson, the former Home Secretary, said Mr Miliband and other top politicians do not understand voters' concerns because too many of them have never worked outside politics. Mr Miliband studied politics at Oxford and then became a special adviser. 'It's not about whether you know the price of a pint of milk or whether you can eat a sandwich properly,' Mr Johnson said. 'But it is about having some understanding of people's lives.' Despite winning more than 300 extra seats in the local elections, Labour failed to make the sort of advance in some key areas seen as vital to securing an overall majority in the Commons next year.","Rachel Reeves said Miliband must not only develop policies but explain them .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron today took aim at triumphant UKIP leader Nigel Farage, dismissing his image as a ‘normal bloke down the pub’. The Prime Minister hit the airwaves after the Tories were pushed into third behind UKIP and Labour, despite his repeated promise to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Mr Cameron said the message from voters had been ‘absolutely received and understood’, but challenged the idea that Mr Farage is anything other than a ‘consummate politician’. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron said the Tories understand the message from voters, after being pushed into third behind UKIP and Labour . After 10 of Great Britain's 11 regional constituencies had declared their results, Ukip had 23 MEPs and a 29.07 per cent share of the vote - up 11.68 per cent on 2009. Labour had 18 MEPs and a 25.35% vote share, narrowly ahead of the Tories with 18 MEPs but 24.56 per cent. Mr Farage, a privately-educated ex-City trader, has played up the idea that he is different to the other party leaders, with regular visits to pubs, including to celebrate last week’s local elections. But he has faced criticism over his use of Brussels allowances and employing his German wife Kirsten using taxpayers’ money. Mr Cameron said: ‘Listening to him on the radio and television over the last few days it all seems supremely tactical. ‘It’s all about trying to grow votes in clusters or something in different parts of the country. So I don’t really accept this thing. He is a consummate politician. ‘We have seen that with his expenses and wife on the pay roll and everything else. So I don’t really accept that he’s a normal bloke down the pub thing.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage celebrates last week's local elections with a pint in a pub, but Mr Cameron dismissed him as a consummate politician . Eurosceptic Conservative MPs said the results from across Europe proved their point. Harwich and Essex MP Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: 'Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are.' Douglas Carswell, the Clacton MP, said: 'So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?' There were fresh calls from some Tories for an electoral pact with UKIP, to stop the haemorrhaging of support in key seats. But Mr Cameron said there would be no deal, but a renewed focus on what the Conservatives could promise voters. Ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from Ukip. The new push, which could see unemployed EU nationals kicked out of the country after just six months, was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the Ukip surge in last week’s elections. Currently, new arrivals cannot claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can. Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months. And Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told The Sunday Times it would be ‘bye bye’ for anyone who had not found work after half a year in the UK. However, the policy faces opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who are yet to sign off on the idea. Critics claimed the policy would have little impact on David Cameron’s drive to reduce net migration below 100,000 before the next election, as it would have no effect on the tens of thousands of arrivals each year who do go on to find work. And questions were raised about the likelihood of large numbers of unemployed EU nationals being removed from the UK when ministers struggle to throw out foreign criminals. He has pledged that if he is still Prime Minister after the next election he will claw powers back from Brussels before holding an in-out vote by 2017. ‘People are deeply disillusioned with the European Union, they don’t feel that the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I would say that message as far as I’m concerned is absolutely received and understood. ‘What we need to do is demonstrate that we are the ones with the plan to sort out this relationship and give people the choice – in or out – by the end of 2017 in that referendum and that is now the task ahead of us. I think that’s what we have got to focus on.’ Former Tory leadership challenger David Davis has called for the EU referendum to be held sooner, to convince voters that the party will deliver on its promise. But Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t agree with that because I want to complete a proper renegotiation, which will improve Britain’s place in Europe and will improve Europe as a whole. ‘I think what’s interesting from last night’s elections and from what European politicians are saying is that there are some like Nicolas Sarkozy, former president of France, who is now saying it really is time for the European Union to give back powers to member states. ‘So where I was something of a lone voice in arguing for this a year ago you can now see a number of allies.’ Tory MEP Dan Hannan argued that if the UKIP and Conservative vote was combined, it would form a majority ofthe electorate and could deliver victory at a general election. He told Sky News: 'If you add the Conservative and Ukip votes together in this country - and I know it doesn't work as simply as that - a rough ballpark figure, we are something like 56% of the total vote. 'It would be very sad if the two right-of-centre Eurosceptic parties at the general election were not able to find some way, at least in marginal seats, of reaching an accommodation so that anti-referendum candidates don't get in with a minority of votes. 'How it would work, if it were to happen, is obviously to be determined at a more senior level than mine. But if personal rivalries and animosities put Ed Miliband in with a minority of the vote, that would reflect badly on all concerned.' But Mr Cameron was adamant that he would not do a deal with UKIP. 'We don't do pacts and deals. Conservative candidates will stand as Conservatives, fight as Conservatives and I hope win as Conservatives,' he said. 'We are not going to be doing deals and pacts.' But the premier ducked the question of what disciplinary action would be taken against Tory candidates who struck local arrangements with Ukip, saying only: 'I don't see any prospect of this happening. 'From what I read in the Sunday newspapers, Nigel Farage wants to destroy the Conservative Party, not work in tandem with it. 'I think there's a great myth that there's somehow some great pact or deal to be done. 'If you want a referendum on Europe, if that's the most important thing for you, there is only one party and one potential prime minister that can deliver that and that is the Conservatives in government. Labour and Liberal Democrats don't want that referendum, Ukip can't deliver it.'","Tories pushed into third place behind UKIP and Labour in Euro elections .

"By . Amanda Williams . As a baby, doctors believed Calvin was just hours from death. But he is now preparing for his third birthday . The parents of a little boy who doctors believed was just hours from death are preparing for his third birthday. Emma Wilkinson, 32, and Gary Marshall, 42, were told their son Calvin was unlikely to survive emergency heart and stomach operations in the weeks after he was born. The little boy was born with a heart condition which was picked up at Miss Wilkinson's 20 week scan. It means the chambers in his heart were reversed, leaving two big holes - a condition termed 'transposition of the great vessels'. The heart problem was found to be an isolated defect probably caused by a random mutation, and could be fixed immediately after delivery with major heart surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Having been separated from her son . after the birth at University College London Hospital on August 11th . 2011, Miss Wilkinson rushed over to the children's hospital in time to . see Calvin - named after the boy in Bill . Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes comic strips - being prepared for theatre. She said: 'He was in the middle of a huge system of different machines. Tubes . were coming in and out everywhere. But apart from the fact his hands . and feet were a little blue, he looked completely normal.' The heart surgery was a success but celebrations were cut short when Calvin stayed unconscious for two days. His repaired heart was beating too fast, leading to problems with the blood supply to his stomach. Ten . days after the surgery Calvin finally opened his eyes. But later that . day his bowel ruptured, immediately requiring a round of life-saving . surgery. Miss Wilkinson said: 'That's when the surgeon told us to expect the worst. 'We were devastated.' 'I . watched him, hooked up to all the machines, and reflected on the fact . that he had been through so much in his few days with us. The little boy was born with a heart condition which was picked up at Miss Wilkinson's 20 week scan. It means the chambers in his heart were reversed, leaving two big holes - a condition termed 'transposition of the great vessels' 'We didn't want to be anywhere else other than with Calvin, but at the same time we couldn't face being in intensive care any longer. 'We just wanted him to get better.' But then, despite the odds, Calvin grew stronger. Emma Wilkinson, 32, and Gary Marshall, 42, were told their son was unlikely to survive emergency heart and stomach operations in the weeks after he was born . Ten days after his heart surgery Calvin finally opened his eyes. But later that day his bowel ruptured, immediately requiring a round of life-saving surgery .

Miss Wilkinson said: 'We were approaching the doors to the ward when a nurse ran towards us and excitedly said she had some wonderful news. Calvin had turned a corner.' As the year drew to a close, Calvin contracted a nervous infection requiring a three-week stay in hospital over Christmas and he now has a shunt fitted to drain excess fluid from his brain. But by January 2012, doctors were confident that Calvin was finally out of the danger zone. Miss Wilkinson said: 'We're never going to be able to be relax fully. 'We need to stay vigilant for infections and we stay in close contact with the specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital. 'Calvin will see speech and occupational therapists, but everyone's really happy with him and he's reaching all the right developmental milestones.

Three years on, and Calvin has reached all the right developmental milestones, and is looking forward to his third birthday . 'He's very cheeky and happy all the time. He loves giving out kisses and cuddles. He's very gentle with other children. 'He's also quite stubborn - he knows what he wants and he's determined to get it. It's a characteristic which must have helped while he was fighting. 'Sometimes I think back to those moments when we didn't think Calvin would survive, and think how lucky we are.

"By . Ruth Styles . He's famous for his exposés of the seedy side of LA life, interviewing everyone from porn stars to pet obsessives in a bid to shine a light on the parts of Hollywood where the cameras don't go. Now Louis Theroux has turned his attentions to a completely different part of LA life - the dying - and unearthed an incredible survival story in the process. When Theroux first met Langston, 22, he was in a coma and not expected to survive. But 37 days later and in the face of overwhelming odds of a million to one, the college athlete woke up. New direction: Theroux goes behind the scenes at LA's Cedars-Sinai to explore the dying process . 'I was amazed,' reveals Theroux. 'The doctors had repeatedly told . us – and told his family – that the best-case scenario for him would be . that he remained in a vegetative state. Best case! 'So to have him wake . up and walk again and converse normally was mind-blowing. I remember . being in the office when my director came off the phone from Langston’s . sister and said he’d woken up. I didn’t believe him. 'It just goes to . show, doctors don’t know everything. Seeing him reunited with his twin . brother after he woke up was one of the most moving things I’ve ever . seen.' So how did a 22-year-old athlete come to be in a coma? The answer is a drug overdose that left him with severely compromised liver and kidney function and traumatic brain damage. Doctors at LA's Cedars-Sinai Medical Center were convinced that the damage was too severe to make recovery possible and had told the family that it would be better to let him go. Harrowing: Langston in hospital with his Aunt Sheila and Louis. Doctors were convinced he wouldn't survive . Survivor: Incredibly, and against all odds, Langston woke up after 37 days in a coma . The family, by contrast, were equally convinced that he would survive and their faith was rewarded when after more than a month, he opened his eyes. 'I'm grateful and I'm thankful to God,' his delighted sister Andrea tells Theroux, 'but I knew he was going to get better - I knew he was going to be OK.' That optimism is at the heart of Theroux's new film, LA Stories: Edge of Life; an optimism that sees doctors, families and patients continuing to treat patients long after they would have been dispatched to a hospice in the UK. 'It’s the nature of the way healthcare is . funded in America,' explains Theroux. 'If you have insurance, then beyond a certain . threshold of cost, everything is covered, with virtually no upper limit. 'So there is a temptation to try everything. Which in some ways is good because there are so many options available. 'But it’s also the case that, . given the vast amounts the US spends on healthcare (compared with other . industrialised nations), the US life expectancy is not what it should be.' And while Langston manages a miraculous recovery, the other severely ill stars of the show; Donta, a 31-year-old with rectal cancer and Javier, a 29-year-old suffering from leukaemia; do not. 'I knew they were at a high risk of . dying soon,' explains Theroux. 'It was deeply affecting to see them live through some of the . most dramatic and upsetting experiences of their lives. 'But, as strange . as it may sound, both Donta and Javier took strength from having the . camera there as a witness to their struggle. Miracle: Langston with his mother Lyle and sister Ashley - neither of whom ever gave up hope . 'I'm good': What Langston, pictured with twin brother Lorne, when he returned to thank them . 'Donta had always worked on . the fringes of show business and he loved the idea of being on a . mainstream TV programme. He wrote glowingly about it on Facebook. 'And . Javier seemed to appreciate having someone from ""the outside"" talking to . him about what he was going through.' The tale of the two men also illustrates the differences between end-of-life care in the US and the UK; not least in terms of the amount of money involved. In Donta's case, the treatment he received in hospital cost more than $2 million -  a lot, you might imagine, for what ultimately turned out to be a futile attempt to save him. So is it right to spend so much on one man that could have been put to use elsewhere? Theroux finds the question a tough one to answer. 'He had . a massive amount of surgery to remove his anal cancer – which had . spread to his liver,' he muses. 'This was a long-shot procedure, especially given . that he had a weakened immune system. His recovery was slow and painful, . and in fact his wound never healed, which contributed to his death. Not so lucky: Javier, who also appears in Theroux' film, in happier times before succumbing to leukaemia . Last moments: Javier married his girlfriend a few days before he died; a moment captured in the documentary . 'It . seems to me that – in a world of finite resources – it wasn’t the best . use of the two million. But I try to put myself in Donta’s position and I . can understand the motivation to get it done, and likewise the doctor’s . urge to do the best for Donta.' Questions about morality and money aside, at heart, the film is about death and how people deal with it - whether that's staving it off for as long as they can or accepting it. Parts are quite simply heart-breaking: The moment when Donta sobs after being told that nothing more can be done for him or when Javier marries his girlfriend in a bedside ceremony. Ultimately, it's oddly uplifting both because of Donta and Javier's bravery and because of Langston's dramatic recovery. After 37 days in intensive care and seven weeks in rehab, the man who everyone thought would end his life as a vegetable strides, beaming, back into the hospital to thank the staff who saved his life. 'I'm good,' he tells the doctor. Proof that, for all its perceived flaws, the American health system can provide some lucky families with miracle. Louis Theroux's LA Stories: Edge Of Life, Sunday night at 9pm on BBC2 . He's no stranger to the weird and wonderful and now Louis Theroux is to tackle one of the weirdest and most wonderful religions of them all - Scientology. 'Scientology is the quintessential . Hollywood religion,' he explains. 'I’ve been trying to make [the film] for years and now we’ve . got funding to do it as a feature documentary film. 'I just put out an . appeal on Twitter for Scientologists to speak to me for the film. They . tend not to do much media so we’ll have to wait and see what comes back.' But that's not all. Now based in Los Angeles, a city that he continues to find fascinating, Theroux is planning more films, although he says subjects are still to be finalised. 'LA embodies the best and worst of America,' he explains. 'Divisions of wealth, vulgarity, energy, breathtaking landscapes, beaches, mountains, deserts, and tracts of crappy housing covering much of the above. 'Talented, funny, creative people creating art that entertains the world and also a certain level of incuriousness about that world. 'People  run the gamut. There is a prejudice that Angelenos are shallow and touchy-feely. That is definitely one part of the truth. 'There is a surface friendliness that doesn’t always run that deep, but then surface friendliness is better than surface unfriendliness.'","Langston, a 22-year-old from LA, appears in Louis Theroux' LA Stories .

Workers shot the crocodile in an attempt to free the man, who was wedged between the jaws of its mouth while still dangling to a rope attached to his fishing vessel. He was discovered on Thursday by the coast guard in the infested waters of the Rio Tuba river, about 710km from the capital of Manila. A crocodile has killed a man after his fishing vessel drifted into infested waters in the Philippines . The man, it was reported, found himself adrift in the in the river by accident while fishing for sea cucumbers underwater.

Ice Cream Sandwich is believed to combine previous the smartphone and tablet operating systems Gingerbread and Honeycomb, into a single operating system. It is rumoured to offer a raft of innovative new features including a lockscreen system using facial recognition, more multitasking and resizable widgets. The firms, Apple and Samsung in particular, are bitter rivals in the smartphone and tablet PC sector. While the iPhone remains the most popular single smartphone handset, sales of phones running the Android platform have outsold it by more than twice the amount globally.

"By . Jill Reilly . As an owner of a curiosity shop, Tanith Newland thought she had seen most unusual items, until a customer brought in a mummified cat and rat - both over 300 years old. She was stunned when the seller opened a box to reveal the ancient pair, which had been found sealed into the walls of an old Welsh cottage. The cat, which is in recognisable shape and still has its claws and teeth, may have been placed in the wall while still alive to ward-off bad luck. Not a normal sale: Tanith Newland who runs Wells Trading Post in Wellls, Somerset, couldn't believe her eyes when the macabre looking specimen was brought in by someone looking to sell it on . Preserved: The mummified animal is thought to be over 300 years old and was found behind the wall of a cottage in Wales . Buried alive: The cat, which is in recognisable shape and still has its claws and teeth, may have been placed in the walls of the house while alive to ward off evil spirits . Dr Marion Gibson, a witchcraft and folklore expert from Exeter University, said hundreds of years ago cats were put into walls to ward-off 'bad luck.' Dr Gibson told BBC news: 'Cats were often put into walls as some kind of good luck charm.

Last December, a cat was found sealed into the walls of a 17th century cottage, in Pendle Hill, the looming Lancashire landmark which for 400 years has been a notorious centre of witchcraft. In 2009, builders working at a house in a Devon village have found the remains of a cat, hidden in a wall. The owner of the house said the cat would be put back where it was found. It is a practice which was widespread across Europe centuries ago. Mrs Newland who runs Wells Trading Post . in Wellls, Somerset, promptly purchased the macabre offerings, and has . put them on display in her window. It is unknown how much she paid for the pair, but she said they have so far caused a mixed reaction with her customers. 'Some people think they’re wonderful, others are shocked,' she said. 'But there’s been plenty of interest in them. 'The hope is that a museum might want them and put them on display. 'It’s not unheard of for cats to have been hidden behind walls.

"By . Patrick Strudwick . Ticks feed on animal or human blood . A huge, red mark the size  of a grapefruit was the first sign something was wrong. Legendary literary agent Ed Victor had just emerged from the shower in his house in upstate New York last summer when his wife Carole pointed to his leg. ‘On the back of my right thigh was a bright bull’s-eye mark – you couldn’t mistake it,’ says Ed. The crimson circle with a ring around it is immediately recognisable to many in America’s Northeast, the telltale first sign of an illness that is  on the rise in Britain: Lyme disease. Ed says: ‘I went right away to an urgent  care surgery near our house, and the doctor took one look and said, ‘‘Classic Lyme disease.’’ ’ The disease comes from a family of bacteria called Borrelia, spread by ticks – small parasitic insects commonly found on animals but which feed on human blood given the chance. They attach for anything from a few hours to weeks, but their bite is painless, so it is often unnoticed. If the disease is transmitted, the potential symptoms are complex and difficult to overcome. And a growing number of British ticks are now carriers.In the early stages symptoms tend to comprise headache, weakness, muscle pain and fever – much like flu. Eighty per cent of sufferers in the first few days develop the bull’s-eye lesion, known as erythema chronicum migrans, or EM. In Europe, our strain of Lyme disease can also cause a purple lump on the ear lobe, scrotum or nipple. But those with EM are at an advantage as it makes diagnosis easier – if a doctor sees the mark. Ed Victor pictured with Nigella Lawson, on of his clients. The literary agent contracted Lyme disease after being bitten by a tick . Ed explains: ‘I said to the doctor, “Why don’t you do a blood test?” And he said, “I’ve seen thousands of these bright red circles, and thousands of cases of Lyme disease. You have it.” ’ The blood test for Lyme disease is not wholly reliable. In many cases, without a positive blood test or EM, diagnosis can  be made based on symptoms and likelihood of contact with an infected tick. For many, however, the disease goes unchecked and undiagnosed. In Britain, where Lyme disease is less common or known, studies suggest as many as 90 per cent of carriers don’t know they have it. ‘Cases in the South of England – as well as across Europe – are increasing,’ says consultant microbiologist Dr Matthew Dryden, Britain’s foremost authority on the disease. Dr Matthew Dryden, an expert on Lyme disease said the number of cases in the south of England is on the up . ‘This could be because of increased housing in greenfield areas, but could also be due to rising populations of deer and ticks, due to global warming.’ With about 1,000 confirmed, treated cases per year (only 15 per cent from infection overseas), if the proportion of undiagnosed incidents is as many as  90 per cent, then up to 9,000 Britons could be suffering debilitating symptoms with no idea what is causing them and nothing to stop the progress of the disease. As the bacteria spread, symptoms worsen. Dr Dryden says: ‘It affects everyone differently. Some don’t have any symptoms and some, even after successful treatment, have post-infection problems that last for months.’ Alongside the initial flu-like state, exhaustion can set in as well as mental confusion, depression, dizziness and heart palpitations. Then, for about ten to 15 per cent, facial palsy, meningitis which triggers intense headaches and light sensitivity, or encephalitis, which can prompt memory loss, sleep disturbance and mood changes. Finally, after a few months, chronic problems can take hold: paralysis, shooting pains, numbness, amnesia, vertigo, panic attacks, weakness in the legs affecting gait, joint problems, and even psychosis. ‘I was one of the lucky ones,’ says Ed, leaning back on a sofa in his office in Bloomsbury, Central London. ‘I was put  on a two-week, high-dose course of the antibiotic amoxicillin straight away.’ Another antibiotic – doxycycline – is used for Lyme in Britain. But while reassured about his own treatment, Ed, whose clients include Nigella Lawson, Eric Clapton, Rupert Everett and Roman Polanski, was alarmed by what his doctor said next. ‘I told him I was going back to England and he said, “Under no circumstances go to a doctor over there. They understand nothing about it. Just do what I’m telling you and you’ll be fine.” ’ This, combined with the fact that an Irish friend of Ed who contracted Lyme’s ‘went to endless specialist hospitals and no one knew what was wrong with him’, persuaded him to speak out. ‘Many GPs are unfamiliar with it because it’s not very common,’ says Dr Dryden. Ed Victor said: 'I was one of the lucky ones' A couple of days after Ed’s EM appeared, he starting having symptoms. ‘I remember vividly how depressed the disease made me. I’m normally very up, optimistic and enthusiastic. But suddenly I was really low. 'I could feel this melancholia descend on me. But I knew it was the Lyme disease so I told myself, “I’ll get through this.” ’ With the depression came a great loss of energy and an almost constant headache. ‘By the end of the two-week course of antibiotics, the depression lifted but dull headaches continued for a while,’ he says. Dr Dryden adds: ‘Some patients are given a diagnosis of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, or fibromyalgia [chronic, unexplained pain].’ Meanwhile, Ed is determined he won’t be put off spending time in his home in the Hamptons – or from golfing, even though he may have been bitten on the course. ‘I’ve had leukaemia and chemotherapy three times so, for me, Lyme wasn’t nearly as bad as that,’ he says. ‘But I will use insect repellent now.’ One tragic victim of Lyme disease was Lisa Hole, 44, who took her own life to escape 'unbearable' symptoms that had left her needing a wheelchair and sometimes bedbound. Her husband of 15 years, John Mladenovich, 46, also committed suicide after watching Lisa die. He was found at their home in Oxford cradling pictures of Lisa, and at the time of  his death was being investigated for assisting her suicide. Lisa Hole took her own life to escape the 'unbearable' symptoms of Lyme disease . It is estimated that up to 17 per cent of the UK tick population carry Lyme disease. Most are in the New Forest, Wiltshire, Exmoor, the South Downs, and the west coast of Scotland, although some infected ticks have been found in London parks. There is currently no drug to prevent Lyme disease. In 2002, a vaccine was introduced in the US but was later withdrawn because of concerns over side effects. Lyme spirochetes, the bacteria which cause the disease . The Lancet reported positive results of a new vaccine trial last year but suggested it might not be available for three years. Once someone is bitten and diagnosed treatment involves antibiotics. The best prevention is to avoid a bite - in wooded, forest areas and long grass, wear a long-sleeve shirt, tuck your trousers into your socks and use insect repellent. If you find a tick, remove it by gently gripping it as close to the skin as possible, preferably using fine tweezers and pull it steadily. Never use a lit cigarette end, a match head or essential oils to force out the tick. These can cause the bug to regurgitate its stomach contents, causing infection.","Ed Victor rushed to hospital when wife saw crimson 'bull's-eye' mark on leg .

"By . Hugo Gye . A schoolboy has forced Tesco to admit it made a mistake on the label of its orange juice after he noticed an embarrassing grammatical blunder. Albert Gifford, 15, was enjoying his breakfast at home in Shepton Mallet, Somerset when he saw that his carton of juice boasted it was made with the 'most tastiest' oranges. He wrote to the supermarket giant to complain, suggesting they change the wording to 'tastiest' or 'most tasty' - and they have now agreed to correct the packaging. Fury: Albert Gifford was shocked to find an embarrassing grammatical blunder on a carton of Tesco juice . Albert, who is studying for his GCSEs at Whitstone School, saw the mistake on the £1 carton of orange juice one morning last month. The label read: 'Only the best quality fruit makes the grade for our juices. We squeeze or press it only when it's perfectly ripe and at its most tastiest.' In his anger at the use of redundant language, Albert marched to his local branch of Tesco to confront the management - but decided it might be more prudent to write to the company instead. He also sent a letter to his local newspaper, saying: 'I am writing concerning an issue I have had with the very popular supermarket chain, Tesco. Wrong: The supermarket giant described the fruit contained in its juice as the 'most tastiest' 'There is a grammatical error on one of their products, and this has affected me greatly. 'I . woke up on Thursday morning a few weeks ago, thinking it would be like . any other. I sat down at the table for breakfast like normal, and picked . up the Tesco orange juice. 'It . was then that I noticed it said ""most tastiest"" when describing the . fruit on the side of the carton. Of course, this could be either ""most . tasty"" or simply ""tastiest"" but to say ""most tastiest"" is just wrong. 'I . was so astonished by this error - especially as Tesco is such a large . company - that I almost started pouring the orange juice on to my . Weetabix. 'My mum stopped me just in time, and shared my shock when I showed her the side of the carton.' Campaign: The 15-year-old schoolboy wrote to Tesco in a bid to make them acknowledge their error . After writing to Tesco, he said, 'For the next few weeks I rushed home after school, beside myself with the anticipation of a receiving a reply. 'But every day I came home to a doormat with only the occasional leaflet urging me to buy this furniture or those clothes, but nothing from Tesco. 'I was devastated the mighty supermarket chain hadn't even acknowledged my existence.' Finally the firm replied, apologising for the mistake and promising not to repeat it in future. 'I'm sorry that there's a grammatical error on our Tesco Pure Smooth Orange Juice packaging,' a spokesman told Albert, who hopes to study medicine at university. 'Our design team checks all packaging very carefully before it's used on any of our products, and we carry out regular reviews, but apparently we overlooked this mistake. I've told our team about this and they will correct the error when the packaging is reprinted.' The schoolboy said: 'I was happy to have a letter back, but a little bit disappointed because it didn't say more and I didn't get any vouchers - but I'm pleased with the result.' He joked: 'I don't think supermarket packaging should be wholly responsible for teaching young people English grammar - but I can't help thinking that ""every little helps"".'","Albert Gifford was eating Weetabix when he saw mistake on carton of Tesco orange juice made with the 'most tastiest' fruit .

"By . Allan Hall . A Swiss father-of-three is being interviewed by police today after it emerged he was the mystery man seen driving from the camping ground with a girl who looked like Maddie McCann days after she vanished in 2007. Karsten Mayer, 41, is a German-speaking Swiss native who lives near the capital Bern whose own daughter was in the family car and who, he says, was mistaken for the missing toddler by a British eyewitness. The potential sighting came three days after Madeleine was abducted from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a few hours drive away. Sighting: A blonde girl identical to Madeleine McCann was supposedly seen with a . German family at the Cabopino campsite on Spain's Costa del Sol . (pictured) just three days after the British toddler went missing five . years ago . It emerged yesterday that British detectives investigating her disappearance have been told a German family paid extra after arriving at the campsite with one more child than expected on May 6, 2007, according to The Sun. But Mr Mayer, who was spotted with the blonde girl, has since insisted the youngster was not Madeleine, and was infact his own daughter. Mr Mayer also pledged to speak to police to clear himself of any connection to missing Madeleine following the media reports yesterday. Missing: Madeleine was abducted from Praia da Luz in Portugal, a few hours drive away from the Spanish campsite, in May 2007 . 'I am turning myself over to police,' said Mr Mayer, a self employed businessman, 'before these media reports get me arrested.' He told Blick, Switzerland's biggest . daily paper; 'I did have a girl around about Maddie's age in the car - . she was my own daughter who also happens to have blonde coloured hair . and was about the same age as Maddie at the time.' Karen . Sisson, 49, the British woman who reported the sighting to police, said . the girl 'looked groggy' and seemingly 'alienated' from the family she . was with. She said the car had German plates that began with BE. But the BE registration for the town and district of Beckum in western Germany went out of use 38 years ago. Journalists in Switzerland used the . number of the car to trace Mr Mayer to his home near Bern - BE standing . for cars registered to the city and surrounding area. Mr Mayer added; 'I was at the camping ground with my family. It is really unbelievable that I am some kind of suspect because we read about Maddie's disappearance on a notice at the campsite. We were shocked and we felt for the parents. 'It is quite possible that my daughter appeared distant. She was tired after a very long road trip. The blonde girl was said to be with a German family driving a Mercedes Vito people carrier (pictured) that was first manufactured in 1996 . Parents: Kate and Gerry McCann pose with an artist's impression of how their daughter might look now at the age of nine . 'We spent 12 days at the camping ground we journeyed further around Portugal. I don't think a kidnapper would have done that. 'I find these media reports about me unbelievable and am reporting to police immediately before I am arrested!' CID officers in Bern say that he has already 'all but' been ruled out of enquiries.","Karsten Mayer was spotted by British holidaymaker with girl who looked 'groggy'

"By . Isla Whitcroft . Alessandro Miccoli had surgery after discovering he had a potentially fatal heart condition . Scroll down for video . Standing . on stage, ready to begin his next number, rock musician Alessandro . Miccoli, 28, felt his heart pounding. 'Within seconds my chest had . tightened up - I could hardly breathe and the arteries on either side of . my neck were sticking out as thick as pencils,' he says. 'I could . see my clothes moving with the power of my heartbeat. The pain was . agonising, and I was terrified I was about to have a heart attack.' Somehow, . he got through the song, then crawled backstage, where an ambulance was . called. 'It took half an hour because when the control centre heard my . age, they downgraded it from an emergency,' he says. However, a monitor . revealed his heart rate was 250 beats per minute. A normal rate for a . healthy young man is 65-80. 'I'd been suffering from minor episodes . of heart pounding from my earlier 20s, and I'd seen my GP several times . who told me not to worry about it,' says Alessandro. 'Previously my . heart rate always returned to normal after a couple of hours, and I was . sure it would this time. Luckily, the paramedics didn't listen to me.' In . hospital, doctors administered morphine for the vice-like chest pain, . while trying unsuccessfully to bring down Alessandro's heart rate with . drugs. After 45 minutes, he was still struggling for breath, and doctors feared he was about to have a potentially fatal heart attack. They . told him he needed emergency treatment under general anaesthetic - . electric shocks would be used to stop then start his heart again, in the . hope this would 'reset' it. 'I knew from their faces that they might . not be able to start my heart again,' recalls Alessandro. The . procedure worked, and the next morning he was told he was suffering from . Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, which affects the electrical circuitry . controlling heartbeats. Alessandro, from Birmingham, had been born . with extra electrical pathways in the heart. Occasionally, electrical . signals travelled down them, causing his heart to contract much faster. Every . year, 600 young people die from conditions affecting the heart's . electrical activity. It's not known how many people are living with . these problems, as most, like Alessandro, are only diagnosed when they . become life-threatening. His symptoms got suddenly worse after he'd . been performing in LA with his twin brother Adriano and their sister . Francesca,  26, as the rock band Miccoli. Alessandro, from Birmingham, had been born with extra electrical pathways in the heart . Late nights and partying . could have triggered his collapse, as people with extra, or distorted, . electrical pathways are sensitive to the stimulation of adrenaline, . explains Sanjay Sharma, professor of inherited cardiac disease and . sports cardiology at St George's NHS Trust, London. 'If their . lifestyle includes a lot of alcohol, caffeine, lengthy exertion or lack . of sleep, it can increase their adrenaline levels and that can . exacerbate the symptoms of their condition, in extreme cases to a fatal . level.' Problems with the heart's electrical circuits are also thought to have a genetic link. Alessandro's . father has had atrial fibrillation, a faulty heart rhythm, for most of . his life, while his grandfather died of a heart attack at 73. After . Alessandro was rushed to hospital in Britain in June 2009, his brother . was found to be suffering from a very mild form of tachycardia - rapid . heartbeat - which didn't need treatment; his sister has not been . affected. Alessandro was put on flecainide acetate, a drug to control . his heart rate, but suffered bad side-effects. His cardiologist then . suggested cardiac ablation, where the extra electrical circuitry is . burnt away, stopping the faulty messages being sent. This treatment . is safe and has an extremely high success rate of up to 95   per cent, . says Professor Sharma. But Alessandro was  unlucky. He had the operation . in early 2010 but two months later was rushed to hospital with a heart . rate of 250. Doctors had to use electric shocks again  to 'reset' it.A . second ablation was out of the question, as patients have to wait at . least three months between them to allow for healing and gauge exactly . how successful the first has been. So Alessandro was sent home and . told to rest. 'Miccoli was on the verge of breaking into the big time, . and I was being told to take it easy,' he says. 'I also felt bad for my . siblings. To  contain our frustration, we decided to help raise . awareness of heart conditions. Once a week, the family went into shopping centres to play free gigs, hand out leaflets, raise money and talk to people. 'I . told them I hadn't pushed my GP for a referral to a cardiologist . because I thought a heart condition was something that happened to old . men,' says Alessandro. 'But up to eight young people a week die from . conditions such as mine.' The campaign had a dramatic result. 'A . woman told us her five-year-old boy had described a ""noisy helicopter in . his chest"". I told her to take him to his GP and insist on a referral.

"Principal Mark Bensley refused two Muslim women from completing their work placement at Redlands College in Queensland . A Christian school principal has come under fire from parents and members of the public after he turned away two Muslim women who wore hijabs on their first day as student teachers. People took to social media to express their disappointment at Principal Mark Bensley's decision. Redlands College parent Jennie Duke wrote she was 'so very sad' her daughter attended the school and her university sent student teachers there, The Courier Mail reported. Others re-branded Redlands College as 'Redneck College' and questioned Mr Bentley's Christian faith. 'It’s not very ""Christian like"" for a Christian school to tell student teachers that they are not welcome to teach and learn because they wear a hijab,' a reader wrote on the newspaper's website. 'Shame on you Redlands College. This could have been a very good way to show Christian love and acceptance.' The two Muslim women were allocated positions to start their work placement at Redlands College, as they are in their final year of studying teaching at university. But Mr Bensley didn't allow the women to go ahead with their placement, and justified his decision in the college newsletter on Tuesday, claiming he acted inside his duty of care, according to the paper. 'I have a duty of care to ensure that those teaching at the College are actively supporting the Christian principles, practices and beliefs of the College,' he wrote. He continued by writing that he viewed the wearing of the hijab to be in direct opposition to the principles which the college upholds. Mr Bensley said he respected the two women's right to wear the hijab but felt it was inappropriate at his school, and had them transferred to another school to complete their placement. In a statement to the publication, Redlands College said that they were accepting and loving of all people from all cultures and religions. A statement from the Christian College denied any wrongdoing and said they are not aware the student teachers had any opposition to being transferred . 'We are not aware that they [student teachers] had any concerns, and it is our understanding that all parties came to a mutual agreement for the benefit of all,' the school said. Redlands also claimed that they would not hide their Christian values and were there to provide for the families seeking a Christian education. A spokesperson for the school said that the decision had nothing to do with intolerance and they condemn any form of that behavior. The Islamic community are disappointed with the decision while a Reverend said it goes against fundamental Christian beliefs . According to Section 25 of the Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, employers are allowed to enforce a 'genuine occupational requirement that workers act in a way that is consistent with the religious beliefs of the school'. However, the move has upset many, including the Muslim community with the Islamic College of Brisbane principal saying the decision was a matter of great concern. Reverend Anneli Sinnko told the Courier Mail that he also disagreed with it, and that the actions are a direct contradiction of the foundations of Christianity.","Redlands College in Brisbane had two women transferred for wearing traditional Muslim headwear to placement .

"By . Joel Christie . The Los Angeles rapper who sliced off his own genitalia before jumping out of a window has broken his silence about the ugly incident last month, saying depression drove him to do it. Andre Johnson - who performs under the stage name Christ Bearer with the Wu-Tang affiliated group Northstar - was reported to have been high on dangerous psychedelic PCP when he cut off his penis and leaped from a two-storey baclony in North Hollywood. But the 40-year-old, also known as C.B., has now told TMZ that he was smoking weed and reading a book about monks and vasectomies right before the self-castration. He said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third child on the way. Self-castrated: Andre Johnson - who goes by his rap name Christ Bearer or C.B. - said he chopped off his own penis because he was depressed about not being able to see his two daughters. He was reported to be under the influence of the psychedelic PCP, which is known for its dissociative effects . TMZ also reported that Johnson's member was able to be reattached by doctors. While he claims he will be able to regain full functionality, having more children will likely not be possible. The incident occurred at an apartment compex about 1am on Wednesday April 16. Police classified the case as an attempted suicide. Friends within the building said Johnson managed the mutilation quickly before running and jumping over the ledge. However E! Online reported that the rapper cut off the tip of his penis first, then removed his testicles and the remainder of his genitalia. E! also said Johnson was under the influence of PCP at the time, which also goes by names Phencyclidine or Angel Dust. Seen here in an earlier photo, Andrew Johnson performs as Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, who were originally discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA . When people from the building ran downstairs to see if Johnson had survived the fall, they said he was already on his feet screaming. He was found in critical condition before he was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The organs were recovered upstairs. Neighbors initially said Johnson did not seem to be under the effect of hard drugs. It was also reported that doctors were unable to reattach his penis. Johnson (right) said he had been smoking weed - and not doing PCP - at the time of the ugly incident on April 16 in North Hollywood . Northstar is described on the Wu-Tang website as a duo from the north side of Long Beach who have produced songs warning of the dangers of drugs and saluting their own Muslim beliefs. In 1998, they were discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA, who produced some of their albums. As Johnson's unfortunate incident hit headlines, RAZA moved to distance himself for the rap duo, releasing a statement he has had nothing to do with them for 10 years. PCP is a 'dissociative drug' meaning that it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. First introduced as a street drug in the 1960s, PCP - which comes in crystal form but is often smoked with a herb like mint or marijuana -  quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. However, some abusers continue to use PCP due to the feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind that PCP can induce.","Andre Johnson, 40, chopped off his own penis inside a North Hollywood apartment about 1am on April 16 .

"By . Liz Hull . Horsemeat found in beef burgers manufactured for British supermarkets was imported from Poland, it emerged last night. Tests have revealed that ‘raw material’ supplied to an Irish processing plant, which made burgers for Tesco, Aldi, Lidl and Iceland, contained as much as 20 per cent horse DNA, the Irish Government said. Around 10million beef burgers have been withdrawn from sale by supermarkets, and other smaller retailers in the UK, since the scandal, which centred around the Silvercrest factory, in County Monaghan, broke earlier this month. Closing in: The source is now thought to be an unnamed factory belonging to ABP Food Group in Poznan, Poland . Customers and food standards experts were left reeling after tests by the Foods Safety Authority of Ireland revealed burgers supplied to Tesco – Britain’s biggest supermarket chain - contained 29.1 per cent horse DNA. Burger King also stopped using Silvercrest’s products, although there was no horsemeat found in burgers sold by the fast food chain. Simon Coveney, the Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, said the latest tests were a ‘major breakthrough’ in their investigation to identify the source of the contaminated products. He had initially suggested imported ingredients from Spain and the Netherlands were to blame, but yesterday revealed the ‘likely’ source was an unnamed factory in the eastern European country. Mr Coveney said the raw material was made from ‘low value’ cuts of meat. International: The diverse origins of British meat highlight the need for control over the food supply chain . Scandal: Burgers supplied to Tesco and other major outlets contained up to 29.1 per cent horse DNA . ‘It’s fat cuts, trims, de-sinewed meats,’ Mr Coveney said. ‘There was equine DNA, which is horsemeat, in the product. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that anyone knowingly imported product that had horse DNA in it, but clearly that is what happened.’ The minister said the ABP Food Group, which owns the plant, had now agreed to source meat only from the UK and Ireland and to introduce regular DNA testing of meat at Silvercrest and its sister factory, Dalepak Hambleton, north Yorkshire. However, the firm, which denied the contaminated meat had come from the company’s plant in Poznan, Poland, refused to say whether it was permitted to use the Polish ingredient in Tesco’s burgers. Supermarkets: A number of prominent chains sold products originating from a Polish factory . Food safety experts say horse DNA poses no health risks to consumers, but the discovery has raised concerns about the food supply chain and the ability to trace meat ingredients. Tesco welcomed the Irish government's . announcement, saying: 'The findings announced by the minister correlate . with the results of our own investigations at the plant.' But Burger King, which switched suppliers . when news of the scandal first broke, said it would be seeking further . reassurance that products for their beef patties were sourced in the . British Isles. 'Despite these findings, we take this matter very seriously,' a spokesman said. 'We . remain committed to identifying suppliers that can produce 100 per cent . pure Irish and British beef products for us that meet our high quality . standards.'","Patties supplied to Aldi, Lidl and Iceland contained up to 20% horse DNA .

"By . Kate Lyons . Swimming legend Ian ‘Thorpedo’ Thorpe faces losing the use of his left arm after developing an infection in hospital, friends fear. The five-time Olympic gold medallist – who has battled depression – requires round-the-clock medical care after picking up the bug following a shoulder operation. It has reportedly become so bad that close friends are concerned he will no longer be able to use his left arm – denying his admirers the chance to ever see him in the pool again. The 31-year-old Australian had undergone surgery for a shoulder injury near his home in the Swiss town of Ronco sopra Ascona, according to Sydney’s Channel Seven television network. Scroll down for video . Australian swimming hero: Five-time gold medalist Ian Thorpe is in an intensive care ward in Sydney, and close associates are gravely concerned for his welfare . He was flown home for further . treatment at a Sydney hospital where he was last night said to be being . treated with large doses of antibiotics. It is not clear exactly where he picked up the infection. Last . night, his manager James Erskine said his condition was ‘serious but . not life-threatening’. He added that Thorpe may not swim competitively . again. The troubled star’s latest crisis comes after he was admitted to rehab in February, suffering from depression. In . recent years, his life appeared to be in turmoil, with questions about . his sexuality – he has denied rumours that he is gay – and claims he . used performance-enhancing drugs. Before . the 2000 Olympics, the head coach of the German team accused him of . cheating, insisting his physical attributes were symptomatic of steroid . use. Surgery complications: A report in Sydney's media claims that the swimmer contracted a 'bug' after surgery that threatens the use of his left arm . A hospital-acquired infection usually first appears three days after admission to a hospital or other health care facility. The infection, which can be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites, may develop from surgical procedures, catheters in the urinary tract or blood vessels or from material in the air which is inhaled into the lungs. These micro-organisms may already be present in the patient's body or come from the environment, contaminated hospital equipment, healthcare workers or other patients. Common hospital infections are MRSA and C Difficile. Sometimes the infection can have devastating results and require a limb to be amputated, if the infection cannot be treated. Some of the common causes of infections are when the hospital: Fails to carry out routine pre-screening for MRSA or C-Difficile prior to surgery; delays in identifying and treating the infection when it has been acquired; fails to treat or monitor the infection appropriately, to provide basic medical care and post-surgical treatment or a clean and safe environment. This was followed . seven years later by claims in a French newspaper that he showed . abnormal levels of two banned substances in a doping test. But . the freestyle specialist was cleared of suspicion when the Australian . Sports Anti-Doping Authority dismissed any suggestion of wrongdoing. Thorpe made an ill-fated attempt to compete at the 2012 London Olympics, struggling in the trials. He told reporters afterwards: ‘The fairytale has turned into a nightmare.’ Thorpe’s . manager, James Erskine, told the ABC in February: ‘He made the decision . [last year] that he would give up competitive swimming. There is plenty . of things to do in life after swimming. He loves cooking, travel, and . is a natural for television. ‘[He needs to find something that will] give him the same type of satisfaction [as swimming]. ‘There . wouldn’t be an Australian who is living today who hasn’t got the pride . and joy of seeing Ian Thorpe swimming and winning gold medals, and who . wouldn’t wish him well,’ Mr Erskine added. The . nightmare continued away from the pool. In his 2013 autobiography, This . Is Me, he confessed he had battled ‘crippling depression’ for more than . a decade. He told how he had considered suicide and had been drinking huge quantities of alcohol to deal with his pain. Yet . he was determined to continue swimming and hoped to be picked for . Australia’s Commonwealth Games team to compete in Scotland this year. But then came the shoulder injury and he had to concede his career was over. In . February, he sought help after being found outside his parents’ home in . Sydney, disoriented from a combination of antidepressants and . medication for the shoulder complaint. Now . the man whose power left the competition behind in the pool faces one . of his biggest  challenges – recovering from the infection that has left . his friends so worried.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . As if seeing the Northern Lights wasn't special enough, Scotland has also been treated to rare displays of fireballs streaking across its skies this week. One of the fireballs was seen lighting up the sky above Sligachan on the Isle of Skye. The rare event was accidentally captured by landscape photographer Marcus McAdam, who has been working on a time lapse video showing a year on Skye condensed into minutes. Scroll down for video... A fireball is seen lighting up the sky above Sligachan on the Isle of Skye. The rare event was accidentally captured by landscape photographer Marcus McAdam, who has been working on a time lapse video showing a year on Skye condensed into minutes . Recently, Mr McAdam set his camera to record the stars over the Cuillin Mountains overnight. Describing what he discovered the next day, Mr McAdam said: ‘As I was loading the images onto my computer, one thumbnail stood out as being quite different to the others, so I enlarged it and saw a huge streak across the sky’. Unsure what he had captured, he asked his Facebook followers and they pointed to a news story about reports of a fireball seen in the sky. Amazingly, he has since discovered that the phenomenon he recorded was a different fireball - meaning there two within 50 miles of each other at around the same time. This incredible picture by Ewan Miles shows the Northern Lights being illuminated by a fireball (diagonal streak, far mid right) in Salen Bay near the east of Ardnamurchan Point in the north of Scotland . Mr McAdam said: ‘I've since learnt that this is an extremely rare event, and even rarer to be photographed, as the whole thing happens in less than a second.’ Other images were captured by amateur photographers Ewan Miles and Byron Griffiths in the west Highlands on Monday night. Mr Miles’ snaps were taken from Salen Bay, east of Ardnamurchan Point, when the shooting light suddenly flew through the atmosphere. He said: ‘The solar winds were blowing on and off all throughout the night and visible through the breaks in the cloud. ‘A huge fireball was a real highlight, which lit up the surrounding landscape for a couple of seconds as it burnt through our atmosphere. Byron Griffiths took this spectacular pictures while out waiting for the Aurora Borealis to show above the Isle of Lewis. The photo was taken at around about half past eight on Monday night. He said: 'I was out to try and photograph the Aurora Borealis and by nothing more than luck the fireball appeared and fell through the field of view of the camera' ‘It was the biggest one I have ever seen and there were plenty of other meteors showing, which could be part of the annual Orionid (corr) shower.’ Byron Griffiths took his spectacular pictures while out waiting for the Aurora Borealis to show above the Isle of Lewis. He said: ‘The photo was taken at around about half past eight on Monday night. ‘I was out to try and photograph the Aurora Borealis and by nothing more than luck the fireball appeared and fell through the field of view of the camera.’ The Northern Lights are created when particle streams from the sun crash into atoms high up in the atmosphere. Earlier this month, a powerful solar flare directed at Earth has put on majestic display of the northern lights across parts of Canada, the U.S and Ireland.  This image shows a young Amish boy on his way to work at 4:30am looking at the light show on Fuller Road in Easton, Maine. The image was captured by 61-year-old photographer Paul Cyr . The effects are greater at the magnetic poles and weaken as they move south from the Arctic or north of the Antarctic. The intensity and frequency of Northern Lights activity is governed by solar cycles that lasts for 11 years. Nasa scientists have predicted that the current period of solar activity will reach a new peak in December. On an official NASA video, Todd Hoeksema, the Director of the Wilcox Solar Observatory at Stanford University, said that by December there should be what is termed a ‘solar flip’. This is when the conditions for viewing the lights would be at their best.
