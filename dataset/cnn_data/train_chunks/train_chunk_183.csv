"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British government is buying 10,000 Taser stun guns for police officers across England and Wales, Britain's Home Office said Monday. British police officers use a Taser gun to tackle a mock suspect in a training exercise. The move will expand the ranks of officers carrying the weapons from ""select firearms squads"" to ""thousands of trained frontline officers,"" according to the Home Office, which is responsible for domestic policing. Home Secretary (Interior Minister) Jacqui Smith said police ""deserve our support, so I want to give the police the tools they tell me they need to confront dangerous people. That is why I am giving the police 10,000 Tasers."" The guns fire barbed darts charged with enough electricity to stun a person, the Home Office said. But Amnesty International UK described them as ""potentially lethal electrical weapons"" that deliver ""50,000 volts of electricity into a person's body. The result is excruciatingly painful, causing a person to fall to the ground and, at times, lose control of their bodily functions."" The human rights group, however, expressed qualified support for the British government move, urging that the weapons be given only to officers specially trained to use them. ""We don't actually oppose the use of Tasers as long as it's by a limited number of highly trained specialist officers, responding to genuinely life-threatening or very dangerous situations,"" said Oliver Sprague, the organization's arms program director. But, he added: ""Tasers are potentially lethal weapons which are already linked to numerous deaths in North America and that's why wide deployment without adequate training is a dangerous step too far for British policing."" ""The home secretary should urgently review this decision and ensure that Tasers only end up in the hands of a small number of fully trained officers capable of making the potentially fatal decision over whether to fire 50,000 volts into a person's body."" Amnesty says more than 300 people have died after being shot with Tasers since 2001. The decision to introduce Tasers across England and Wales follows what the government called a successful pilot program with officers from 10 police forces, including London's Metropolitan Police and forces responsible for Liverpool and Bristol. The test ran for 12 months from September 2007 with constables who had not previously carried firearms, a Home Office spokesman said. Before the pilot program, approximately 6,000 specially trained firearms officers across the country had access to Tasers starting in 2004. Most British police officers do not carry any kind of firearm, Home Secretary Smith emphasized in her statement, a fact she said she was proud of.","Police officers across England and Wales to armed with Taser stun guns .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- The Hizbul Mujahedeen militant group has claimed responsibility for the Wednesday morning attack on an Indian paramilitary camp in Srinagar in Kashmir province. Five Indian officers died at the police training camp, authorities said. It was the first attack in the city of Srinagar in at least three years, CNN's sister network IBN reported. A Hizbul Mujahedeen spokesman told a local news agency that two militants carried out ""the guerrilla attack"" and warned that ""the outfit will carry on such attacks in (the) future also."" The attack comes a month after the execution in India of a Kashmir militant who led an attack on the nation's parliament in 2001. Nine people were killed in that incident. Since Mohammed Afzal Guru's execution, his supporters in Srinagar have demanded through protest that his body be returned. Authorities in India have accused Pakistan of backing Guru's attack, which led to a massive mobilization of troops by the two nuclear neighbors along their tense borders. Pakistan denied involvement. Indian Home Secretary R.K. Singh -- who said three civilians and five police officers also were injured in the Srinagar attack -- said Wednesday he believes the attackers came from Pakistan. They ""appeared ... to be not local, but from across the border,"" he said in New Delhi. But Pakistan's Foreign Office dismissed India's charge. ""Pakistan strongly rejects any allegations made about its involvement in the incident in Kashmir on Wednesday,"" spokesman Moazzam Ahmed Khan said. That stance was repeated in a Pakistani government press release, which added, ""We feel that this trend of making irresponsible statements and knee-jerk reactions by senior Indian government functionaries have the potential of undermining the efforts made by both sides to normalize relation between the two countries."" Kashmir has been disputed territory between India and Pakistan since the two countries separated in 1947 after a costly war. Militants supporting Pakistan have been fighting for more than 20 years against Indian rule in the parts controlled by that country, which has a mostly Muslim population. The insurgency has killed more than 43,000 people, but some human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the death toll at twice that. The two attackers in the Wednesday incident were killed, said Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of the Indian-administered Kashmir. Journalist Mukhtar Ahmad reported from Srinagar and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","The Hizbul Mujahedeen militant group claims responsibility and warns of further attacks .

"(CNN) -- As you struggle to read this with that one sleepy eye just barely open, you're probably deep into your post-Thanksgiving tryptophan coma, sitting peacefully on the sofa with a laptop balanced by your gut. Maybe you're still trying to rationalize the fact that your projectile shirt button flew across the dinner table and killed Uncle Dave. ""At least he died so I could have more gravy."" ""He would've wanted it that way."" But don't worry. Nobody blames you for murdering Uncle Dave; everyone's just too happy to see your sweet punim back at home. They love you, and it's good to spend quality time with your family during Thanksgiving. Besides, if you get it over with now you won't have to suffer again for another year. Think of it like an annual physical. Just turn your head to the left and give Nana a kiss. Of course, the only real alternative to being fat, sleepy and useless in the living room is to actually get out of the house and do some early holiday shopping with the masses. Which is a terribly misguided idea because (A) it involves being around other people and (B) putting on pants. Most retailers sort of require that. The bottom line is that there's no real point being out in public at this stage of the food coma. Stay home. Embrace the chemicals. Be lazy. And, so long as you've got the laptop out, you might as well join us in 2012 and do all your shopping the way Al Gore intended: Online, half-awake and fully bloated. America! And, hey, just to make it even easier, I've already uncovered a great trending gift that, while not necessarily new, has gained renewed popularity on the interwebs. It's called the Boyfriend Pillow. Essentially, this thing serves as a bedtime substitute for the missing man in your life. Feel the warmth and security as you curl its plush arm around your body and rest your head on the half-chested slab of memory foam that oddly happens to be wearing a full button-down shirt to bed. Maybe he just came home drunk from happy hour. Again. Oh, but you don't care. You still love him. ""Mmmm, let's go to sleep. What do you say, sexy Boyfriend Pillow?"" ""I want a Hot Pocket."" For those who prefer the comfort of a woman in bed, they also make the Girlfriend Pillow. It's essentially the same idea as the male version, but this one has large, and astonishingly disproportionate, memory foam breasts. The other major difference is that (shocker) the Girlfriend Pillow isn't wearing a shirt, because, clearly, this was designed by a man. And likely one who reads Maxim. So, if you're actually interested in buying one of these pillows, both the male and female versions run about $30 and are sold by a company called Deluxe Comfort. Even if you're not interested, you might still find amusement from the descriptions on their website. In promoting the Boyfriend Pillow, they write: ""This fun and cozy snuggle pillow is excellent for people whose partner is away on military leave or work absence. Singles, who desire to feel the touch of a man, without actually having to be with one, will love it too."" It's the second part that concerns me: ""...without actually having to be with one."" Are we men really that bad? Let's just allow their product overview for the Girlfriend Pillow to answer that: ""...maybe you enjoy a better sleep when you locate your neck in your girlfriend or wife's breast."" Confirmed. It appears we are, in fact, horrible people. But at least we're consistent. So, if giving weird, possibly inappropriate gifts is your thing, hop online before they're all gone on Cyber Monday. And maybe get one of these for your dear, sad auntie. Perhaps she'll enjoy having someone next to her in bed again. Of course, there's no replacing Uncle Dave.

"(CNN) -- It's been almost a decade since the United States accused Iran of actively working on a secret program to develop nuclear weapons. Since then, Iran has steadfastly proclaimed to a skeptical world that it only seeks to produce nuclear energy, while American presidents have repeatedly warned that the United States will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. Over the years, the international community has demanded, to no avail, that Tehran end its uranium enrichment program. Iran's defiance, coupled with its threats to destroy Israel, have led Israel to consider the option of a pre-emptive strike. World powers have repeated their preference for a diplomatic solution reached through ""sustained dialogue"" as the possibility of negotiations surfaces once again. The statement came after Iran indicated it might let U.N. inspectors visit the military facility at Parchin, from which it had recently blocked them. But negotiations have failed many times without slowing Iran's enrichment activities. The risk is increasing as the United Nations nuclear agency chief expresses renewed concern about Iran's nuclear intentions. Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Wednesday that, ""Iran has engaged in activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices."" Gary Sick: Are sanctions leading to war? Tension is high. President Obama's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week did not produce any breakthrough. No one knows how the standoff over Iran's nuclear program will unfold. But some possible scenarios have crossed people's minds. 1. Iran backs down and opens up to diplomacy. Under the weight of sanctions and the threat of war, Iran's leaders agree to a softened version of the U.N. demands. The theocracy survives, war is avoided and the opposition remains weak under the Ayatollahs' heels, hoping to rise up another day. 2. The West attacks. Watching the negotiations drag on and the advances made in Iran's nuclear program, Israel decides that it cannot trust President Obama to ""always have Israel's back."" Israeli fighter jets, flying with permission from Saudi Arabia across Saudi airspace, launch a bombing campaign against fortified Iranian nuclear targets. Or, President Obama, who has consistently expressed his preference for diplomacy, could reach a point where he believes diplomacy has failed and force, a last resort, has to be used. The U.S. attacks Iran without U.N. support (China and Russia indignantly object) but with the backing of European allies (though not NATO because Turkey indignantly objects.) Some Arab countries quietly cheer from the sidelines hoping to see their historic Persian rival pushed back. If either Israel or the United States attacks, Iran's nuclear installations are destroyed. Iran fights and loses. The regime is weakened and eventually a somewhat more Western-friendly government takes power. The new government says Iran has a right to nuclear power, but decides it's a bad idea to pursue a nuclear program for the time being. Alternatively, Iran doggedly fights back with allied militias in Lebanon and Gaza attacking Israel. The war lasts longer than anyone expected. Chaos descends on the Middle East. Israeli civilians move to underground shelters. Iran's nuclear program is set back but the regime survives, vowing revenge toward the attackers. The country remains a perpetrator and sponsor of terrorism around the world but it is no longer capable of enriching uranium. 3. Iran reaches ability to make a bomb. Iran manages to achieve ""breakout"" nuclear capability, accumulating everything it needs to assemble a nuclear bomb. Israel's security concerns are heightened. Its rival neighbors in Arab countries and in Turkey rush to catch up. The chances of wars and conflicts in the Middle East increase. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and others try to acquire nuclear weapons. The world becomes a less safe place as barriers against nuclear proliferation become less effective. Granderson: Will Iran cost Obama the presidency? 4. Iran calls the world's bluff. The diplomatic dance of threats, sanctions and speeches goes on until one day Iran announces that the Persian Empire has been restored to its old glory. Iran has a nuclear bomb and anyone who dares challenge it will be dispatched to the afterlife. Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and others feel vulnerable next to a nuclear capable Tehran. They try to build their own nuclear weapons. Emboldened by its ability, Iran's rhetoric becomes more defiant. Calls for Israel's destruction are regularly interspersed with mocking statements about Arab leaders who are friendly to the West or, worse, those who support peace with Israel. Iran's threat to ""wipe Israel off the map"" hangs in the air. War becomes unavoidable, but by now it's a war between nuclear-armed nations. Undoubtedly, no one wants another war. But Iran's pursuit and acquisition of nuclear weapons could ultimately prove more catastrophic for the Middle East, the West and the entire world. The international community must find a way to end Iran's nuclear program. After 10 years of threats and warnings, Tehran may no longer believe that it has to give up its nuclear program. The only way war may be avoided is if Iran believes an attack from the West is a real possibility. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Israel is considering military option because of Iran's nuclear aspirations .

"(CNN) -- The sister of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says there are no hard feelings after a ""leaked"" family photo raised questions about online etiquette and privacy on the social network. Randi Zuckerberg, Facebook's former marketing chief and producer of the Bravo reality series ""Silicon Valley,"" posted a photo Wednesday of her family laughing with their smartphones while apparently playing with Facebook's new Poke app. In the background of the photo, taken in a spacious kitchen, is her brother Mark, sporting his trademark hoodie. It's unclear exactly what happened next. Either Zuckerberg accidentally made the photo available to all her subscribers instead of only her friends, or a friend of a friend saw it when one of Zuckerberg's friends ""liked"" or commented on it. Either way, Callie Schweitzer, a marketing director for Vox Media, saw it and shared it on Twitter with her 40,000 followers. ""@randizuckerberg demonstrates her family's response to Poke,"" she wrote, with a link to the photo. Zuckerberg quickly replied: ""Not sure where you got this photo. I posted it only to friends on FB. You reposting it on Twitter is way uncool."" She then turned around and offered more general commentary to 132,000 followers of her own. ""Digital etiquette: always ask permission before posting a friend's photo publicly. It's not about privacy settings, it's about human decency,"" she wrote. (Most of those comments have since been deleted but were captured by tech blogs and other sites.) What, if anything, the incident says about Facebook's privacy policies is subject to debate. Some Internet wags were quick to pounce on the episode as an ironic example of Facebook's confusing privacy settings: See? Protecting your information on Facebook is so tricky that even a former Facebook executive couldn't do it. But who among us has never misclicked something in a drop-down menu? And if Schweitzer did, in fact, see the photo because a friend commented on it, that's how Facebook is supposed to work -- unless users have adjusted their default settings. Privacy, though, is always a tricky business for the social megasite. This month, Facebook announced an overhaul to its privacy settings, addressing past complaints that the tools available to clamp down on one's profile are scattered and hard to find, much less use. And Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo apps, recently backed down on a controversial change to its terms of use that appeared to give the company the right to sell photos to advertisers. That said, all appears to have ended well in Randi Zuckerberg's case. Schweitzer quickly issued a mea culpa. ""I'm just your subscriber and this was top of my newsfeed. Genuinely sorry but it came up in my feed and seemed public,"" she tweeted to Zuckerberg. And later: ""fwiw, I thought the photo was incredibly endearing which is why I liked it. We never see humans on the Internet!"" By Thursday, Zuckerberg was putting a happy face on the whole thing. ""Fwiw, I've been exchanging emails w/ @cschweitz & she seems lovely,"" she wrote. ""The silver lining? Glad to see a thoughtful debate on sharing/etiquette.""","Randi Zuckerberg, former Facebook exec and CEO's sister, in flap over shared photo .

"(CNN) -- The two surviving members of The Doors have put aside old tensions and are planning to reunite for a tribute concert in honor of the band's late keyboardist, Ray Manzarek. Guitarist Robby Krieger says he and drummer John Densmore have been in contact since Manzarek's sudden death last month, following a battle with bile duct cancer. The Doors' Ray Manzarek dies at 74 . ""We're talking about it,"" Krieger tells CNN, confirming tribute plans. ""Not sure when or where it will be, but we'll definitely do it."" The Doors were formed in 1965, after keyboardist Manzarek met a UCLA film student and poet named Jim Morrison on Southern California's Venice Beach. The pair then joined forces with Krieger and Densmore, and The Doors went on to become one of the most controversial and successful rock acts of the '60s. The band sold more than 100 million albums worldwide, and gained fame for hits like ""L.A. Woman,"" ""Hello, I Love You"" and ""Light My Fire."" After Morrison's death in 1971, The Doors continued as a trio for two more years before disbanding. In 2002, Manzarek and Krieger formed a new version of The Doors called ""The Doors of the 21st Century,"" featuring Ian Astbury from The Cult on vocals. Densmore did not participate in this incarnation and, along with Morrison's estate, sued the others to prevent them from using The Doors in the name of their band. In recent years, Manzarek and Krieger toured under the moniker Manzarek-Krieger, or Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of The Doors. Krieger says he was stunned by Manzarek's passing. He recalls a devastating phone message from his longtime bandmate in early May, with Manzarek displaying his infamous dry wit even while delivering heartbreaking news about his health. ""I got a voice mail from Ray saying, 'This is Ray Manzarek, your keyboard player, and I'm dying -- but maybe not!' And so I called him back, and he told me what was going on, and that was maybe two weeks before he passed,"" Krieger recalls. ""He'd gone over to Germany to try to get a cure at the clinic over there, and that was pretty much the last I talked to him."" Manzarek died on May 20. In the meantime, Krieger has been keeping busy, prepping a tour with his side project, Robby Krieger's Jam Kitchen. ""It's kind of a jam band, some of the guys from Frank Zappa's band,"" Krieger explains. ""We do kind of jazz-rock, our own stuff, as well as a few Doors songs."" In the fall, three of Krieger's guitars will be featured in a new coffee table book of photographs by Lisa S. Johnson called ""108 Rock Star Guitars."" It's the first time he's allowed his instruments to be photographed for a published collection. Even with new projects in the works, Krieger's thoughts haven't strayed too far from his friend, Ray Manzarek. ""It's not easy, you know. Ray was such a part of my life, and he passed away kind of suddenly. It throws you for a loop, but we'll get past it. He had a great life, so what can you say?""","Doors' keyboardist Manzarek died at age 74 in May following a battle with bile duct cancer .

"Columbiana, Alabama (CNN) -- Shelby County is booming. The Birmingham suburb is lined with strip malls, subdivisions, and small factories, in what was once sleepy farmland. The population has grown fivefold since 1970 to about 200,000. Change is afoot in this bedroom community, at least on the surface. But the federal government thinks an underlying threat of discrimination remains throughout Alabama and other parts of the country in perhaps the most hard-fought franchise in the Constitution: the right to vote. Competing voices in this county, echoes of decades-long debates over equal access to the polls, now spill out in a 21st century fight, one that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court. Veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost . ""I think they are looking at this situation through rose-colored glasses,"" says the Rev. Dr. Harry Jones, a local civil rights leader, about the current majority white power structure in Shelby. ""I think they have painted a picture to make the outside world believe that racism is no more. But if you dig beneath the surface I think you'll find what you are looking for."" A longtime county leader, however, says things truly have changed for the better. ""Here, now, in this decade, we have black registered voters at a percentage that is equal, and at some occasions exceeding, the voting of the white population,"" says County Attorney Frank ""Butch"" Ellis Jr. ""It's hard to find that there's any discrimination here, and certainly there's nothing in the congressional record."" Major case for court this term . Now the nine-member high court is poised to rule in coming days on whether the key enforcement provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 should be scrapped, as a constitutionally unnecessary vestige of the civil rights era. Known as Section 5, it gives the federal government open-ended oversight of states and localities like Shelby County with a history of voter discrimination. Any changes in voting laws and procedures in the covered states must be ""precleared"" with Washington. That could include something as simple as moving a polling place temporarily across the street. The provision was reauthorized by Congress in 2006 for another 25 years. Shelby officials subsequently filed suit, saying the monitoring is overly burdensome and unwarranted. This case is one of the biggest the justices tackle this term, offering a social, political, and legal barometer on the progress of civil rights in the United States and the level of national vigilance still needed to ensure minorities have an unburdened path to the election process. High court poised for high-stakes rulings . Test of federal authority . Civil rights groups say Section 5 has proven an important tool to protect minority voters from local governments that would set unfair, shifting barriers to the polls. If it is ruled unconstitutional, they warn, the very power and effect of the entire Voting Rights Act would crumble. But the provision's opponents counter it should not be enforced in areas where it can be argued racial discrimination no longer exists. The appeal presents the court and its shaky conservative majority with two of the most hotly debated issues in politics as well as constitutional law -- race and federalism. It will be a major test of Washington's authority, and the extent to which the central government may consider vestiges of voting discrimination that may still linger, potentially keeping some minority voters disenfranchised. The Voting Rights Act was a monumental political achievement during the Civil Rights era. It banned such things as poll taxes and literacy tests that had long suppressed black voter turnout. States like California and Texas also have a history of discrimination against Hispanic voters. In upholding the coverage requirements, the high court in 1966 succinctly summarized the law's purpose: ""Congress felt itself confronted by an insidious and pervasive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution,"" said the justices. ""Congress concluded that the unsuccessful remedies which it had prescribed in the past would have to be replaced by sterner and more elaborate measures in order to satisfy the clear commands of the Fifteenth Amendment."" The act was to expire in 2007 but was extended by Congress to 2032. It places all or parts of 15 states with a record of past discrimination -- mostly in the South -- under strict requirements on election procedures. The Justice Department has defended continuing use of the preclearance provision in court, but the NAACP has led the charge to raise public awareness of the case. ""Closing off the paths to the polls and by trying to deter people from voting is too often practiced and trained and focused on minority communities,"" said Debo Adegbile, special counsel with the group's Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who argued before the justices in February. ""It doesn't happen everywhere but it happens too much."" Shelby County is 11% African-American, compared with 28% statewide. Frank Ellis and his family have deep roots there. He is a former state senator and the county attorney for a half-century. His son, Corley, serves on the nine-member, all-white county commission. From his comfortable law offices, Ellis was persuaded to bring this legal fight because of what he says is a fundamental question of inequality in the Section 5 regulatory scheme. ""Over the years we realized that this burden was unfair and unjustified,"" he said. ""We just elected a black member of the board of education, with a 90% white population. We've elected a black mayor over a white incumbent, we've elected black city council members."" Many neighborhoods, he says, are integrated. Fast facts: Top U.S. Supreme Court decisions . The dispute in Calera . Ellis acknowledges a voting dispute in the city of Calera was not handled well by local officials, but chafes at the assumption things are irreparably bad in Shelby County. He says it is especially hard to disprove a negative. He is convinced that no pervasive racial bias currently exists in the county power structure. ""The South has changed, it is not the same it was in 1964,"" Ellis said. ""The whole country has changed. We are a dynamic society, not just in Alabama but everywhere."" Some have called the preclearance requirement a Scarlet Letter or badge of shame Southern states, mostly, must perpetually endure. Racism, in the minds of many African-Americans and Hispanics in the county, is subtle and deep-rooted -- a ""good ol' boy"" system, as the Rev. Jones puts it. He and other civil rights activists point to the 2008 election in Calera, where only one African-American was serving, Ernest Montgomery. The city, over the objections of the Justice Department under its Section 5 authority, changed the voting boundaries, costing Montgomery his seat. He believes it was an effort to weaken minority voting strength. ""Some sub-developments were added to my district and diluted the African-American district from a 67% district down to about 28%,"" Montgomery told CNN. ""I think of the possibility of what could happen if Section 5 could go away -- that some of the old mindsets would kind of fall back into place."" After the feds intervened, a new election was held and Montgomery got his seat back. He holds it today. The government points out that some areas have gotten out of Section 5. In recent years, 31 cities and counties in Virginia successfully petitioned to be exempt from the preclearance requirements, though the rest of the state remains under federal oversight. New Hampshire was removed from federal oversight in March. Shelby County has not made such a request; it opposes Section 5 on its face. Opinion: Bring voting into the digital age . 'Serious constitutional questions' The Justice Department also said the Supreme Court had, in recent years, narrowed the scope of some aspects of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who could prove a swing vote in the Alabama dispute, noted in an earlier unrelated case involving Section 5 that ""racial discrimination and racially polarized voting are not ancient history."" But it may be Chief Justice John Roberts who is exercising the power to lead the tricky but crucial opinion-writing exercise. That is because he authored that 2009 high court ruling, suggesting Section 5's days were numbered. He said the preclearance provision raises ""serious constitutional questions,"" and added it ""represents an intrusion into areas of state and local responsibility that is unfamiliar to our federal system."" ""Things have changed in the South. Voter turnout and registration rates now approach parity,"" Roberts said at the time, echoing the views Shelby County now makes in its appeal. ""Past success alone ... is not adequate justification to retain the preclearance requirements."" The court for four years avoided the key question of the law's constitutionality. Civil rights supporters worry the court's five conservative members will strike down this and another pending appeal over affirmative action in public college admissions. Any dispute about voting slips inevitably into politics and efforts by both Republicans and Democrats to preserve their power bases. Section 5 lawsuits have been acute in the past two years. They involve challenges to constitutionally mandated boundary changes in state and congressional districts based on the 2010 census; new, stricter voter identification requirements; and reductions in early voting periods. Those fights are now clogging the federal courts. Some conservative groups have argued that ""ancient formulas"" are being applied today, not to erase discrimination, but to benefit a particular political party. Some liberal activists counter Section 5 and federal oversight are being demonized by many on the right for purely partisan gain, and to divide Americans again over race. In Shelby, both sides know the nation is watching and know the stakes will ripple widely. ""I'm not saying everything's perfect,"" Ellis tells CNN. ""But I'm saying, very few of the non-covered jurisdictions can give you a success story like I've just given you out here in Shelby County."" ""I agree that things have changed in the South and they are better,"" says Jones, senior pastor at New Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church in Calera, ""but they haven't reached the point where we could do away with Section 5 yet. ""It's a lot better, but it still lives, discrimination still lives, and I'm not willing to trust (voting enforcement) into the hands of people whose motives are not pure."" The case is Shelby County v. Holder (12-96). CNN's Joe Johns and Stacey Samuel contributed to this report.","The leaders of Shelby County, Alabama, say preclearance is no longer needed .

"(CNN) -- Country music star Mindy McCready was found dead Sunday at her home in Arkansas from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local sheriff's office said in a statement. She was 37. Deputies from the Cleburne County Sheriff's Office were dispatched to a report of gunshots fired Sunday afternoon and found McCready's body on the front porch, the statement read. McCready leaves behind two boys, one of whom is 10 months old. The infant's father, record producer David Wilson, died of an apparent suicide last month. The singer struggled with addiction and mental illness, often publicly. She appeared in an episode of ""Celebrity Rehab"" three years ago with Dr. Drew Pinsky, who said he contacted her last month after her boyfriend's death. ""When I heard she was struggling, I did reach out to her and urged her to go to take care of herself, get in a facility if she felt she needed,"" said Pinsky, who hosts his own program on CNN's sister network HLN. ""Her biggest fear was the stigma of doing so and what people would think if she, God forbid, took care of herself. And this to me is the most distressing part of this story. She is a lovely woman, we have lost her, and it didn't have to go down like this."" McCready burst onto the music scene in 1996 with her debut album ""10,000 Angels,"" and the chart-topping hit ""Guys Do It All the Time."" In the past few years, McCready waged a public battle for custody of her elder son, Zander. She took the boy from her mother, who had custody, and fled with him to her home in Arkansas, saying she had concerns over his safety. McCready fights for custody of her son . A judge ordered authorities to pick up the boy, who was 5 at the time, and days later authorities found McCready hiding with Zander in a closet at her home. Country music stars expressed their condolences Sunday on hearing news of McCready's death. ""I grew up listening to Mindy McCready ... so sad for her family tonight. Many prayers are going out to them,"" tweeted singer Carrie Underwood. ""It breaks my heart what addiction continues to take from this life,"" singer Wynonna Judd wrote in a series of tweets. ""Addiction is a disEASE & not a character flaw. When the pain becomes too much, it causes people to want that pain to stop. This is just so unbelieveable & so sad."" A year ago, McCready posted excerpts of a book she said was upcoming about her life. She acknowledged a difficult upbringing, personal problems and the challenges she faced turning her life around.

"(CNN) -- India made Edgbaston a home from home Sunday to beat England by five runs in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy. After rain had reduced the allocated 50 overs per side to just 20 overs each, India successfully defended their 129 for seven score as England fell agonizingly five runs short. Roared on by thousands of their fans, who formed the majority of the crowd at the ground in Birmingham, the reigning 50 overs world champions again showed their mettle in one-day cricket. Chasing a moderate target, but on a worn pitch taking spin, England looked well-placed to win after a fine stand between Eoin Morgan (33) and Ravi Bopara (30). But paceman Ishant Sharma, who looked the weak link in the Indian attack, then struck back by claiming the pair in successive balls in the 18th over. Two more wickets fell in the next over bowed by left arm spinner Ravi Jadeja to leave England reeling. Tailender James Tredwell needed a six off the last ball bowled by Ravichandra Ashwin, but his desperate heave was unsuccessful. It left India to celebrate, having gone through the eight-team tournament undefeated, while England are still waiting for a global one-day international trophy. They have lost in the final of three World Cups and the final of the 2004 staging of the Champions Trophy in England. They will now turn their attentions to the battle for the famous Ashes against old foes Australia -- with the first Test taking place next month. For India, it's another triumph under the captaincy of MS Dhoni, but victory looked unlikely after a below par batting display, only lifted by an excellent late stand from top scorer Virat Kohli (43) and the ever dangerous Jadeja, who was named man of the match. Dhoni was proud his team kept their nerve at the death. ""We handled the pressure really well. People talk about technique but the better players are the ones who respond to the pressure,"" he told Sky Sports.","India win ICC Champions Trophy .

"(CNN) -- Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah offered his resignation nearly three weeks after he accepted the job, two Palestinian government sources said Thursday. It's not clear whether Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will accept the resignation. Sources said Hamdallah made the because of interference by Abbas with the prime minister's duties. Abbas named Hamdallah, president of a West Bank university, as his new prime minister on June 2 and asked him to form a new Cabinet. Hamdallah replaced Salam Fayyad, who had led a caretaker government since Abbas accepted his resignation in April. Fayyad's decision to step down was viewed as a step toward the possible establishment of a unity government between the two main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas. Hamdallah is a British-educated linguist and longtime academic. He became president of An-Najah National University in the West Bank city of Nablus in 1998 and was finalizing his departure from the post after he accepted the prime minister's job.","NEW: Sources say the prime minister is upset because of interference by Mahmoud Abbas .

"(CNN) -- More than one speaker at the Democratic National Convention alleged this week that a Mitt Romney presidency would spell financial ruin for Medicare in four years. The claim stems from earlier projections, made before the Democrats' health care reform law was passed in 2010, that Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund would be insolvent before the end of this decade. Former President Bill Clinton led the way Wednesday, saying that the Democrat-backed Affordable Care Act bought time for Medicare and made it financially solid until 2024. He said Romney, who wants to repeal the act, would reverse this gain and make Medicare ""go broke in 2016."" Fact Check: The not-so-empty factory . The statements: . ""So, if (Romney is) elected and if he does what he promised to do, Medicare will now go broke in 2016. Think about that. That means, after all, we won't have to wait until their voucher program kicks in, in 2023, to see the end of Medicare as we know it."" -- Former President Bill Clinton, Wednesday . ""The plan (Romney is) proposing would cause Medicare to go bankrupt by 2016."" -- Vice President Joe Biden, Thursday . The facts: . We'll look first at Medicare's financial situation and then Romney's plan. When officials talk of Medicare insolvency, they're talking specifically about the trust fund for Medicare's hospital insurance, or Medicare Part A, which covers inpatient hospital stays, care at a nursing facility, hospice care and some home health care. The other parts of Medicare, though costs are rising, are ""adequately financed"" for now, the program's trustees say. The Part A fund's overseers -- the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds -- said back in 2009, before the Affordable Care Act passed, that the banked money used to make up the difference between income (such as taxes) and expenses for Part A would be depleted in 2017. But then the Affordable Care Act passed. The trustees reported that the act's lower expenditures (cutting rates to providers) and increased revenues (a payroll tax hike for wealthier people in 2013) ""improves the financial outlook for Medicare substantially."" The trustees reported in 2010 that health care reform would delay the Part A trust fund's insolvency until 2029. By 2011, the trustees moved that insolvency estimate back to 2024. By that date, the trust fund would be depleted. But that doesn't mean the Medicare Part A program would collapse. Revenues would be able to pay for most of the costs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the program, said this year: ""Projected (trust fund) revenue would be adequate to cover 87% of estimated expenditures in 2024 and 67% of projected costs in 2050."" And even if it got to that point -- in 2016, 2024 or whenever -- it's highly unlikely that Congress wouldn't step in to prevent any shortfall. The center put it this way: . ""In practice, Congress has never allowed a Medicare trust fund to exhaust its assets."" That would be nothing to cheer, as it could mean even greater budget deficits. In an April 2012 paper arguing that claims that Medicare is nearing bankruptcy are misleading, the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says that Medicare nonetheless ""faces serious financing challenges in order to make the (Part A) trust fund solvent over the long term and to reduce unsustainable federal budget deficits that are driven in part by Medicare's rising costs."" But both the Congressional Research Service and the CBPP have noted that trustees have warned of pending insolvency for the past four decades, with reports varying from two years away to 28 years. ""But Medicare benefits have always been paid because Congress has taken steps to keep spending and resources in balance in the near term,"" the CBPP said in its April report. As for the present situation, one of the trustees, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, said that without the health care reform, Medicare Part A would only be able to pay costs in full until 2016, CNNMoney reported. So, where does Romney come in? Romney calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act. He also wants to set up a ""premium support system"" for Medicare, meaning seniors would get vouchers to buy coverage from either private insurance providers or a government-run Medicare insurance plan. Romney's campaign says the voucher plan wouldn't affect ""seniors or those nearing retirement"" -- meaning it wouldn't go into effect for years. A similar plan championed by his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, would go into effect in 2023. The GOP presidential nominee, while not necessarily adopting all of his running mate's plan, has said it ""makes important strides in the right direction."" Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told CNN on Thursday that repealing the health care reform law would, by itself, return the insolvency date of the Part A trust fund to 2016. If Romney also delays the voucher program so that it won't affect soon-to-be retirees, it will have no effect on the 2016 insolvency date, Van de Water said by phone. ""As long as he sticks with that (delay), then the premium-support proposal has no effect within the relevant time period,"" Van de Water said. Still, as Medicare's administrators have said, it's highly unlikely that Congress wouldn't move to patch up the trust fund past 2016. ""I presume that, at the end of the day, if Gov. Romney were elected president, he would figure out some way to make sure that the trust fund didn't become insolvent in 2016. But the question is, how would he do it? Because his specific proposal (repealing the Affordable Care Act) makes the financing problem worse, rather than better."" University of North Carolina professor Jonathan Oberlander, a Medicare historian, said that repealing the Affordable Care Act ""would in fact worsen Medicare's financial condition"" and move up the projected date for the Part A trust fund's insolvency. But ""Medicare is not going bankrupt,"" he said. ""It would have a projected shortfall in the hospital trust fund and you would need to make changes to address that shortfall,"" Oberlander said. ""But Medicare would still have most of the necessary funds to pay those expenses, and other parts of the program would be unaffected. Medicare won't go bankrupt in the literal sense in 2016 or 2024 or 2064 -- or ever."" Van de Water said there weren't enough details about Romney's plan to project whether his voucher plan would help the trust fund's solvency long-term. But he did say that under the Ryan plan, the rate of Medicare spending growth per person ""is somewhat less than what is expected under current law."" ""It would reduce Medicare spending, and so it would improve Medicare solvency. But it shifts costs to beneficiaries,"" Van de Water said. Consumer advocates worry that seniors would wind up paying much more for care under the Ryan plan. They point to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows spending would be between 35% and 42% lower for new enrollees under the Ryan plan versus traditional Medicare, CNNMoney reported. When asked for a response to Clinton's criticism, Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg wrote that under President Barack Obama's current plan, ""Medicare will go bankrupt in 2024."" ""Mitt Romney has a plan for Medicare that protects it for today's seniors and strengthens it for future generations,"" she wrote in an e-mail. The Romney campaign also accuses Obama of taking $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act. Romney's campaign got the $716 billion figure from a July 24 Congressional Budget Office report, which measured the impact of repealing the health care overhaul. But the report also notes that the projected $716 billion increase in Medicare spending if the measure is repealed does not signal a $716 billion decrease if the measure stays in place -- which is Romney's argument. Conclusion: . A repeal of the Affordable Care Act -- counting no other action -- may worsen Medicare's financial situation and move up the projected insolvency date of Part A's trust fund from 2024 to 2016. But experts agree that other moves would be on the table. While it's conceivable that Romney's Medicare plans as stated wouldn't be implemented in time to counter the 2016 projection specifically, it's highly unlikely that no action would be taken to shore up the fund in the interim.

"(CNN) -- I live my life in the open: I'm easily googleable, emailable, and you can figure out from my Twitter and Instagram accounts what I've been doing. For a while my phone number was posted publicly on my Facebook profile. I'm aware that these sites and services are tracking me. I know they're collecting my data, crunching it and selling it to advertisers, who in turn try to sell me things, and I am OK with this. It's the cost of admission. These services help me stay connected with my friends and interact with strangers, and in turn I grant them permission to analyze my tweets and profile my Facebook interests for profit. The revelation that the government is snooping on our communications in the interest of national security is nothing new. This latest incident doesn't come as a shocker. You might guess that I reacted with mild surprise followed by general indifference, because young people are already sharing everything anyway. Besides, privacy is dead, right? Privacy is not dead. The phone snooping is on a different level than that of companies selling my data to advertisers. Such behavior is unsettling, and is perhaps a true threat to privacy. There are some in Silicon Valley who regard privacy as a relic of the past, something that falls off the back of the truck of progress as it rumbles into the future. It reminds me of sci-fi author Rudy Rucker's novel, ""Postsingular,"" in which entrepreneurs unleash nanobots that virtually overnight blanket the earth and create an Internet-on-steroids instantly connecting everything on the planet, letting humans peer into any part of the world. The novel is a thought experiment on the obliteration of privacy, and Rucker imagines dumpster-diving as routine â€” everyone can peer into the trash can at McDonald's and find discarded but perfectly edible griddle cakes. Crime basically disappears as everyone knows where everyone else is and what they are doing. Even clothing is a mere formality. But even in the book there are blind spots, places the nanobots can't reach. In our real world, privacy isn't anywhere close to dead. Privacy today is just more nuanced and exists in different ways than 10, 50, 100 years ago. It is not simply a matter of sharing more or less; not merely how much but in what way and with whom. Privacy is contingent on who we're trying to keep something private from -- family, friends, acquaintances, employers, strangers. With more services and apps and greater degrees of control in which we can use them, we find ourselves having to make more decisions about where to draw the lines. Friends of mine will untag themselves from Facebook photos to hide more unflattering images of themselves if they are ""friends"" with their employers. Some refrain from posting to Facebook things they don't want their parents to see, opting for Twitter instead, where their parents don't have accounts. Snapchat is built around a privacy-minded constraint: Mission Impossible-esque messages that self-destruct shortly after opening. The nature of social media also makes room for subterfuge, and an illusory openness is another form of privacy. The Internet allows for masks, false identities and misrepresentation. It's prevalent enough in online dating, for instance, that MTV has a show devoted to it. There may be new spotlights illuminating our lives, but these lights also cast shadows, and these shadows become new places where we can hide ourselves from the world. The kind privacy that is becoming more of the norm is dependent on our ability to move freely among the myriad services and apps, and to opt in selectively, both in what we use and how we choose to use them. I'm not about to disable all my accounts. But I do wonder if we're heading into a future where we have to be constantly mindful of when our privacy might just slip through the cracks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jack Cheng.","Jack Cheng: I live my life in the open, I'm OK with websites and services tracking me .

"(CNN) -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied additional aid tied to deadly explosions at a Texas fertilizer plant, a decision ripped Wednesday by local and state officials who accused President Barack Obama of having ""gone against his word."" FEMA's administrator informed Gov. Rick Perry in a letter Monday that it was denying a request to declare West, Texas -- the small town where an April 17 fire led to simultaneous blasts at a fertilizer distribution facility, killing 15 and decimating homes, businesses and more within 37 blocks -- a ""major disaster"" area. The letter noted Obama had previously issued an emergency declaration and other measures that paved the way for some direct federal assistance. ""Based on our review of all of the information available, it has been determined that the remaining costs for permanent work is within the capabilities of the state and affected local governments,"" FEMA's Craig Fugate said. ""Accordingly, we have determined that a major disaster declaration is not necessary."" Perry responded with a statement alluding to Obama's remarks at a memorial event held days after the explosions that the people of West would not be forgotten. ""We'll be there even after the cameras leave and after the attention turns elsewhere,"" Obama said then. ""Your country will remain ever ready to help you recover and rebuild and reclaim your community."" The Texas governor added Wednesday, ""We anticipate the president will hold true to his word and help us work with FEMA to ensure much-needed assistance reaches the community of West."" Perry's words were measured compared with those of state Attorney General Greg Abbott. Abbott -- a Republican like Perry -- accused the Democratic president of having ""yet again promised one thing and then not delivered."" ""President Obama's FEMA has denied our state and our neighbors the necessary opportunities to rebuild critical infrastructure in the town, including an entire school,"" the attorney general said. ""While President Obama has turned his back on Texas and gone against his word, we will continue to take care of our neighbors."" West's mayor, Tommy Muska, said Wednesday he is ""disappointed"" in FEMA and Obama, saying ""we don't have money available ... and we can't repay ... loaned money back."" ""The president said he was going to be behind us, and his words and actions are completely different,"" Muska said. ""The government at this time is not doing anything to help this city rebuild."" A fire at the facility operated by West Fertilizer Company set off two explosions that registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and were felt 50 miles away. The blasts leveled a portion of the town, damaging numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school. According to local officials, the city is still well short of the $17 million it needs to repair roads, water and sewage lines and other damaged infrastructure. And the school system is estimated to be about $25 million to $30 million short of the roughly $100 million it says it needs for rebuilding and temporary housing. Authorities haven't publicly determined what caused the fire, saying it could have started from a spark from a golf cart, an electrical short or could have been set intentionally. In May, authorities announced they had launched a criminal investigation into the case, though no one has been charged. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","FEMA does not declare West a ""major disaster"" area, which would've meant more funds .

"(CNN) -- It's not easy being a parent at the best of times - let alone when you're the father of a brooding Kryptonian. But Russell Crowe steps up to the challenge in the latest incarnation of Superman, fathering the ""Man of Steel"" played by Englishman Henry Cavill. And if some viewers happen to notice a particularly convincing on-screen tenderness between the two actors, it could well be because of chance encounter over a decade ago. It was in 2000 while filming the hostage thriller Proof of Life at the Stowe School in Buckinghamshire that Crowe, a lifelong rugby fan, spotted a young talent on the school pitch. ""There was a rugby match being played in the background and there was one kid on that field who was quite dominant and fluid and so he caught my eye. And in between shots that kid came over and talked to me but all his questions were about acting."" Watch: Crowe and Cavill at the London premiere of Man of Steel . The 16 year-old in shorts was none other than Henry Cavill, who until then had only played parts in school productions. Cavill remembers, ""I walked up to him, stuck my hand out and said 'Hi my name's Henry, I am considering becoming an actor, any tips? What's it like?"" and he said ""well you know the pay is great but sometimes they don't treat you so good - and I'm paraphrasing!"" This brief meeting left a lasting impression with the Gladiator star, even once he had returned home to the other side of the world. ""I figured the greatest thing you could get when you're in boarding school or something is unexpected mail"" explains Crowe, who sent a box over to the young fan a couple of days later. ""I received an Aussie rugby jersey,"" Cavill remembers, ""some Aussie sweets, some Vegemite, a band CD and a picture of him in Gladiator saying 'Dear Henry, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Russell."" Caped crusaders on patrol - meet the real life superheroes . Nobody could have predicted that the journey would lead to the $250 million Superman reboot Man of Steel, least of all Russell Crowe, who struggled to recognise his co-star: . ""Twelve years later I'm in a gym in Naperville, Illinois and I'm working out with my son in this movie that I'm doing, he's on the other side of the gym and I knew I knew him from somewhere, I just didn't know - I couldn't place him."" Crowe notes that after a workout he asked Cavill ""do I know you?"" Cavill smiled and after and after several months was still reluctant to reveal all. Read more: Man of Steel at the box office . ""I didn't want walk up to him and put him in that embarrassing situation where he has to lie to me like 'Hi, remember me? The kid from 12 years ago, the one kid you met during the shoot one day' I just assumed he wouldn't."" But, Crowe did remember: . ""He said 'do you remember a kid that came and talked to you?' I went yeah, he goes and he talked to you about acting?' I said yes I do remember that, what did I say? And he said 'well they pay you pretty well but they treat you like s*** and I said yes Henry I did say that, good to see you! So it's an amazing little karmic circle."" ""We had a good laugh about it"" recalls Cavill. ""It's one of those moments in life where you think what are the chances?""","Russell Crowe and Henry Cavill's paths first crossed when Crowe was filming scenes for Proof of Life at Cavill's boarding school.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to getting their G-men, Bayern Munich are arguably giving their European rivals a masterclass in acquiring the very best. First it was Pep Guardiola, the manager instrumental in Barcelona's success in Europe and domestically. And now Mario Goetze, described as a ""once in a century player,"" is on his way to southern Germany. Ahead of Bayern's Champions League semifinal against Barcelona, the news of Goetze's impending arrival turned the focus, if only temporarily, away from club president Uli Hoeness who is under scrutiny in a tax evasion investigation. Goetze's agent Volker Struth told Borussia Dortmund that the 20-year-old German international wants to invoke a release clause triggered by Bayern, Dortmund said on its official Facebook page. Although Dortmund didn't reveal the amount of the escape clause, German tabloid Bild reported it was a hefty €37 million ($48 million). That would pad Dortmund's coffers and make Goetze the second most expensive signing in Bundesliga history -- Bayern spent €40 million ($52 million) on Athletic Bilbao and Spain midfielder Javi Martinez only a year ago. Goetze is set to join Bayern on July 1, the same day Guardiola, a promoter of young talent at Barcelona, begins his reign. ""We are obviously disappointed beyond measure, but emphasize that both Mario and his advisers have behaved within terms of the contract,"" said Dortmund chief executive officer Hans-Joachim Watzke. An early start . Goetze made his Bundesliga debut at 17 and has already appeared 22 times for Germany, scoring five goals. He helped Dortmund win the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012. Goetze's ability to dribble at pace, operate in various positions in midfield and great vision earned him the ""once in a century"" plaudits from none other than German legend Matthias Sammer. He has formed an exciting partnership with another young German international at Borussia Dortmund, Marco Reus. Landing Goetze marks the third time in three years the Bavarian club -- that Hoeness played an instrumental role in building on and off the pitch -- has lured a top transfer target from a fellow Bundesliga club. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer left Schalke in 2011 and striker Mario Mandzukic parted with Wolfsburg last year following his impressive performances for Croatia at Euro 2012. There might be another arrival from Dortmund, too. Goetze's teammate, Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, is reportedly being chased by Bayern -- as well as Manchester United. Dortmund supporters lost one of their favorites last year, midfielder Shinji Kagawa, to the Red Devils in a deal worth £14 million ($21 million). Goetze, born in Bavaria, could face his soon-to-be teammates in the Champions League final at Wembley in May since Dortmund and Bayern are both in the semifinals. While Bayern face Barca on Tuesday, Dortmund play Real Madrid -- the record nine-time winner in the competition -- on Wednesday. On its website Dortmund billed the first leg of its semifinal Wednesday as the ""most spectacular home game"" in its history and claimed the match would be the ""biggest television event"" in Germany since the 2006 World Cup semifinal between Germany and Italy. ""Coach Jurgen Klopp and sporting director Michael Zorc asks all fans of Borussia Dortmund to support Mario Goetze unconditionally as they would any other player in the final games of the season, but especially in the important Champions League semifinal against Real Madrid,"" Dortmund said. Powerful Bayern . Bayern won this season's Bundesliga with a record six games to spare and was last week named by Forbes as the fifth most valuable soccer team in the world at $1.3 billion. Bayern was the lone German representative in a top 10 dominated by England's Premier League, which has more lax ownership regulations and a lucrative television rights deal but also more teams in financial distress. In the Bundesliga, all but two of the 18 teams adhere to the 50+1 rule -- fans own 50 percent plus one of the clubs. According to Swiss Ramble, a blog mostly dedicated to the business of soccer, Bayern's revenue rose from €223 million ($290 million) in 2007 to €368 million ($479 million) in 2012. Dortmund's increase over the same period, €99 million ($129 million), put it second, with Goetze's sale sure to improve the numbers further. Dortmund's pre-tax profits in 2011/2012 rose to 37 million euros, said SwissRamble, eight years after it nearly went bankrupt. Hoeness, who won three of the biggest prizes in soccer as a player -- the World Cup, European Championships and European Cup -- told tax authorities in January about a private bank account he held in Switzerland. ""Through my tax adviser I turned myself in to tax authorities in January 2013. It was in relation to a Swiss bank account of mine,"" the Bayern president told Focus magazine. The amount hasn't been disclosed, though Bild reported that Hoeness has already paid back €6 million ($7.8 million). ""Tax evasion is without any doubt a serious crime and there can be no justification at all for tax evasion,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel spokesman Seibert told a news conference on Monday. ""Uli Hoeness has disappointed many people in Germany, including the Chancellor."" Reporters were barred from asking questions about Hoeness' tax affairs at Bayern's press conference ahead of the Barcelona clash. The 61-year-old Hoeness has been a key figure in helping to turn Bayern Munich into a global powerhouse that not only wins titles with established stars but nurtures young talent, similar to Barcelona.","Mario Goetze to leave Borussia Dortmund for Bayern Munich .

"(CNN) -- Peruvian judges began a sentencing hearing Friday for Joran van der Sloot, who pleaded guilty two days earlier to all charges related to the killing of a 21-year-old woman. Enrique Flores, brother of the victim, said that family members planned to be in court for van der Sloot's sentencing. He said none attended the court proceedings on Wednesday, when the 24-year-old Dutch national confessed to the charges of ""qualified murder"" and simple robbery. It was an apparent attempt to win a more lenient sentence, using a plea called an ""anticipated conclusion of the process"" under Peruvian law. Five days earlier, the three judges delayed the start of van der Sloot's trial after he declined to give a plea after expressing reservations about the ""aggravating factors"" tied to admitting his guilt. Under sentencing guidelines, the panel of judges on Friday could order van der Sloot imprisoned for as much as 30 years. As he appeared red-faced, frowning and with his head hung low, his attorney, Jose Luis Jimenez, argued Wednesday that a shorter sentence was in order. Jimenez claimed that his client was under special stress the day the 2010 murder occurred, which marked five years after Natalee Holloway went missing. Van der Sloot -- who, with two others, was among the last people seen with the Alabama teenager -- was detained twice, but never charged, in Holloway's disappearance. Natalee Holloway declared legally dead . ""He was pointed at and persecuted. The world had been against him for five years before this case, for a murder he said he never committed and for which there is no evidence whatsoever,"" said Jimenez. Police say van der Sloot murdered Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010, then took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. Investigators believe he killed the Peruvian woman after she found something related to the Holloway case on van der Sloot's computer while she was visiting him in his hotel room. Alabama Probate Judge Alan King on Thursday -- about six and a half years after she went missing -- signed an order declaring Natalee Holloway legally dead. The girl's body has never been found, and no one has been charged in Aruba. But van der Sloot does faces possible extradition to the United States in a matter tied to Holloway's disappearance and her family. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores.","Joran van der Sloot is set to be sentenced in a Peruvian court on Friday .

"(CNN) -- A class action lawsuit against Instagram has been filed in San Francisco federal court, following user outrage regarding the mobile photo sharing app's changed Terms of Service. This appears to be the first civil lawsuit filed as a result of Instagram's service term changes, Reuters reports. Lucy Funes, a California Instagram user, claimed breach of contract, among other things, on behalf of herself and others similarly affected. The lawsuit was filed Friday despite Instagram reverting some of the clauses it had announced it would change. ""In short, Instagram declares that 'possession is nine-tenths of the law and if you don't like it, you can't stop us,'"" the lawsuit says. Mashable has reached out to Facebook, the company that now owns Instagram, for comment, and will update this story should Facebook respond. Instagram Vows: We Won't Use Your Photos in Ads . Last week, Instagram announced that it had changed its TOS, which spurred widespread outrage from users and celebrities -- National Geographic even shut down its account, though it's now posting again. The new rules suggested Instagram would sell users' photos without compensation and introduced a mandatory arbitration clause, which would force users to waive their rights to file a class action lawsuit in most circumstances. Following the user response, CEO Keving Systrom retracted the new clause about using photos without compensation.

"(CNN) -- At the age of 5, NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin knew something wasn't quite right with his cousin. ""I remember going to his house and I never understood why he had to take so much medicine every single day. I just didn't understand it and really until I got a little bit older did I realize that he had a disease that there was no cure for,"" Hamlin says. Hamlin's cousin Kevin Jones has cystic fibrosis, a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, those affected by the disease have a defective gene that causes the body to produce abnormally thick mucus, which can cause the lungs to clog and lead to life-threatening lung infections. It can also block the pancreas and make it difficult for the body to break down food. The cousins grew up together and watching Jones battle the disease profoundly affected Hamlin. ""He's (Jones) had a couple lung transplants that have been successful, which is really good and he leads a very normal life. But for me it touched me, knowing that one of my family members had to go through that struggle every single day,"" says Hamlin. His cousin is never far from his mind, even when he climbs into his race car every week to compete in NASCAR's elite series. ""We've always run a slogan on the back of our race car ever since I was 16 -- ""so close yet so far,"" which is the slogan of the Cystic Fibrosis (Foundation), because they are so close to having a cure."" The effects of watching Jones' struggle ultimately led Hamlin to establish the Denny Hamlin Foundation in 2008. The foundation's primary goals are to raise awareness and funds for children dealing with cystic fibrosis. In the foundation's short existence, it has raised more than a million dollars for the cause. The Hamlin foundation contributes to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as well as to several children's hospitals that treat kids with this disease. One such hospital is the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU in Hamlin's hometown. He has donated to the hospital's clinic and research lab. ""The research center at VCU has really done a great job of welcoming us in and we've contributed a lot of money to them because they do a lot of the research for cystic fibrosis. They've shown significant gains as far as trying to find a cure for it in just the last few years and I'd like to think we had something to do with that,"" Hamlin says. The connection between Hamlin and the people at VCU is obvious. He relates to the young patients he visits with, but the staff as well. Banners bearing his picture hang throughout the clinic, as well as messages wishing him good luck in his attempt to win a NASCAR championship. In the restricted area of the research lab, appreciation and understanding of the gift he has given is deeply felt. There is a tiny cardboard cutout of Hamlin in his race suit on top of a refrigerator that contains cells. Staff members joke that they call him the Guardian of the Cells. Hamlin's quiet determination is clear on his face. He is dedicated to fighting for his cousin and all who suffer the same turbulent life. According to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the current median age of survival is late 30s. This is not enough for Hamlin. He says he will continue to raise money through events like his Short Track Showdown and a celebrity golf tournament. He will march on in his fight until, as he says, C.F. no longer stands for cystic fibrosis, but ""eventually we hope C.F. means cure found.""","NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin is dedicated to raising money to find a cystic fibrosis cure .

"(CNN) -- Relax. Those ""My Birthday Calendar"" requests on Facebook might be annoying, but they're not dangerous. A warning that's gone viral on Facebook, as these things tend to do, claims that the app is malware that accesses your data and spams all of your friends. But a top Web security firm says that's not the case. ""It appears that the warnings are causing much more traffic and wasting more time than the supposedly aggressive Facebook application,"" Graham Cluley, of Web security firm Sophos, wrote in a blog post Friday. The cut-and-paste warning, with all the requisite spelling and punctuation errors, has usually been some variation of this: . ""WARNING: URGENT! People are getting inquiries allegedly linked to a program called ""my birthday calendar"". ""My birthday calendar"" is a malicious application to retrieve data from all profiles. It's very aggressive, just a click makes it starts sending requests to all your friends/contacts. If a request comes from me just ignore it; NOTE please copy and warn your friends"" Cluley says that Sophos has checked out the app and that ""it would be appropriate to classify this chain letter as a hoax warning."" Snopes, the longtime home base for debunking Internet shenanigans, has also cleared the app of any wrongoing. The phony viral warning circulated once before in December 2011, according to Snopes. That said, Cluley wrote that the false warning is a good reminder that legitimate Facebook apps can, in fact, access some of your data if you give them permission. If you're not comfortable with one, don't approve it. And even if you're careful, apps your friends install can sometimes access information about you, too -- at least as much as those friends can see about you.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for Friday's bombing of a mosque in Rawalpindi and vowed to carry out more attacks, according to an e-mail message from the group. The assault targeted a mosque frequented by Pakistani military personnel, and killed 36 and wounded 75, the military said. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan took responsibility for the action on Friday but reiterated its claim in an e-mail to CNN on Saturday because media outlets quoted analysts and some officials who doubted the group's participation. Watch a report about the attack . ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it, and will do more which are already planned,"" the group said. ""We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces,"" the e-mail message said. Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed the mosque in Rawalpindi, and most of the victims were children. The attack was the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army.

"(CNN) -- Pep Guardiola surely faces the most thankless task in world football after Bayern Munich clinched a historic treble on Saturday, adding the German Cup to the Champions League and Bundesliga crowns. The Spaniard, who was named as Bayern's next coach back in January, will take over a team that has conquered Europe and its domestic rivals, with the 3-2 win over Stuttgart giving the departing Jupp Heynckes a perfect sendoff. The 68-year-old is widely expected to retire, though he has also been linked with a return to Real Madrid -- where he won the Champions League in 1998 -- after guiding the Bavarians to 45 wins from 53 matches this season. Stuttgart never looked like inflicting Bayern's fourth defeat of the campaign after going 3-0 down after an hour, with Thomas Muller netting a first-half penalty and striker Mario Gomez scoring twice against his former club in what could prove to be his final game for Bayern. Austrian Martin Harnik struck twice to give Stuttgart hope in front of more than 74,000 fans at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, but Bayern held on for a 16th victory in the knockout competition to become the first German side to complete such a treble. Guardiola helped Barcelona become the first Spanish club to win a hat-trick of titles in 2011, but was unable to follow that up last season before standing down. Barca completed this season in style on Saturday, beating Malaga 4-1 to equal Real's points record of 100 and beat the club's best goals tally -- scoring 115 in 38 La Liga games. Striker David Villa, Cesc Fabregas and young defender Martin Montoya all netted within 16 minutes, while veteran midfielder Andres Iniesta curled in a spectacular second-half effort before substitute Pedro Morales pulled one back for Malaga. Eric Abidal came on to make his final appearance for Barca, with the French defender being released despite making his comeback in April following a liver transplant. Villa's future is also in doubt, with Barca having signed Brazil forward Neymar from Santos last week. Malaga manager Manuel Pellegrini is also on the move, being widely expected to join English club Manchester City. The Chilean announced last month that he is leaving the Spanish club, which ended the season in sixth place and reached the Champions League quarterfinals. Jose Mourinho's three-year tenure at Real Madrid ended with a 4-2 win at home to Osasuna, which left his second-placed side 15 points behind Barcelona. The Portuguese coach, who is expected to rejoin English club Chelsea, was booed by large sections of home fans before the match -- though others held banners thanking him -- and he was surrounded by photographers every time he ventured from the dugout. He has divided opinion at the Santiago Bernabeu after being unable to follow up last season's title, or deliver Real's long-awaited 10th European title -- and the Copa del Rey final defeat against Atletico Madrid was the last straw as he agreed to leave by mutual consent. Despite Mourinho's apparent dressing room rift with former captain Iker Casillas and other key Spanish players, Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa said the 50-year-old deserved respect. ""We respect his decision, the club's too, and wish him well. We all know that we have taken a major leap in competitiveness and we knew we could have achieved a lot, but due to small details or bad luck it was not to be,"" Arbeloa said. ""He has had his successes and failures, as we have all had, but he gave his all and defended Real Madrid above everything."" Real Sociedad snatched a place in the Champions League qualifying rounds, winning 1-0 at Deportivo la Coruna to ensure Valencia missed out after a 4-3 defeat at Sevilla. Striker Alvaro Negredo scored all four goals for mid-table Sevilla as visiting Valencia dropped to fifth place despite a second-half double from forward Roberto Soldado. The defeat relegated second bottom Deportivo, while Mallorca also went down despite winning 4-2 against Valladolid. Celta Vigo moved out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win over Espanyol, but Zaragoza ended the season at the foot of the table after losing 3-1 at home to third-placed Atletico.","German Cup final victory gives Bayern Munich a hat-trick of titles this season .

"(CNN) -- A Spanish study found women are more susceptible to guilt than men, and suggested that in the interests of equality, men should accept more guilt, women less. Equality considered in such terms is a shibboleth. Guilt is bad stuff; it poisons life, saps resolution and crushes orgasmic potency. No psychologist ought to wish more guilt on anyone of any sex. Dr. Itziar Extebarria, who led the study of 360 men and women carried out at the University of the Basque Country and published in the Spanish Journal of Psychology, says the research ""highlights the need for educational practices and socializing agents to reduce the tendency towards anxious aggressive guilt in women, and to promote interpersonal sensitivity in men."" Rescuing women from their burden of unwarranted guilt is going to require ""educational practices and socializing agents"" even more effective than the ones that have been relentlessly loading female humans with responsibility for other people's behavior from their earliest childhood. Guilt is one side of a nasty triangle; the other two are shame and stigma. This grim coalition combines to inculpate women themselves of the crimes committed against them. Opinion: Why women trash successful women . Women feel more guilt than men, not because of some weird chromosomal issue but because they have a history of being blamed for other people's behavior. You get hit, you must have annoyed someone; you get raped, you must have excited someone; your kid is a junkie, you must have brought him up wrong. Any victim of sexual offenses who denounces the perpetrator should incur no shame. But she does. And to conceal the identity of a victim of a sexual offense, which is routine, is to endorse this profoundly misogynist prejudice. Until women feel free to identify offenders without shame, the wounds inflicted on them will remain unhealed. For example, the Indian gang rape victim who was given the International Women of Courage Award by the U.S. State Department on International Women's Day recently is known only by a collection of sobriquets, of which the popular favorite is ""Nirbhaya,"" or ""Fearless."" No member of her family was present at the ceremony to hear U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry say fatuously that there would be ""no more stigma against victims or survivors"" when he had perpetuated that very stigma by refusing to reveal Nirbhaya's identity. Why can we not know who Nirbhaya was? Because to be raped by a gang of drunken goondahs is to be dishonored. The stigma extends to her family, her community and even to her university. She has been honored because she did the decent thing. She died. She is not around screaming for justice; she is dead. Her achievement is to be a victim. When the Obama administration hooked its wagon to the star of a sex martyr, it did little for the women who endure humiliation and stigma every day. Libyan Eman al-Obeidy has not been identified as a woman of courage, even though -- or perhaps because -- on March 26, 2011, she sought out the international media at the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli to denounce the 15 Moammar Gadhafi thugs who gang-raped her, beat her and pushed a Kalashnikov into her rectum. She found temporary asylum in Qatar only to be handed back to the Libyans; she is now living in exile in the United States. Her mistake was to survive. Because she did not die for other people's crimes, the offenses against her are now described as ""alleged."" Her credibility is shot. Eman al-Obeidy: When rape is a tool of repression . Women live lives of continual apology. They are born and raised to take the blame for other people's behavior. If they are treated without respect, they tell themselves that they have failed to earn respect. If their husbands do not fancy them, it is because they are unattractive. Dirt and disorder in the family home is their fault, though they created none of it. In Shakespeare's ""Othello,"" as Desdemona lies dying, strangled by her husband, Emilia cries out, ""Oh who hath done this deed?"" and Desdemona answers, ""Nobody. I myself."" The moment is extreme, but the phenomenon happens daily. Women all over the world, across cultures, are excusing the violence that men mete out to them, often, most tragically, interpreting acts of pure brutality as evidence of love. According to the British Crime Survey, two women die at the hands of their male partners every week. The police can't help them if they won't leave a violent partner; they choose to stay and die. Until we have unraveled this conundrum, we will never understand women. Until women themselves reject stigma and refuse to feel shame for the way others treat them, they have no hope of achieving full human stature. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described the four essential freedoms as freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. The fifth essential freedom to be fought for is freedom from shame. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Germaine Greer.","Germaine Greer: Study found women feel the poison of guilt more than men .

When a rape victim is unnamed, she says, it supports the stigmatization of rape .

"(CNN) -- From teary-eyed teenager to the proud owner of a green jacket, Adam Scott's transformation from best of the rest to major winner has involved a fair amount of heartache. The newly-crowned Masters champion watched on television as his hero and fellow Australian Greg Norman threw away a six-shot lead at Augusta in 1996, while Scott himself blew a four-shot advantage over the final four holes of last year's British Open. But there was no collapse, no choking on Sunday. The new world No. 3 showed nerves of steel to defeat overnight co-leader Angel Cabrera in a tense two-hole playoff to win the first major of 2013. ""The whole nation stopped that day and felt for Greg,"" Scott told CNN when asked about Norman's implosion on April 14, 1996. The tale of Twitter: Masters social media reaction . ""It was so hard to see your hero not come up with the goods that day like he normally always did. I learned lessons out of that day. ""It's an amazing journey, the whole golfing career. I've played a lot of majors and to finally get one means a lot. I've knocked on the door a couple of times recently, to get over the hurdle is hopefully the start of something to come."" Scott has flirted with major success on a number of occasions. He finished third at the 2006 PGA Championship before tying for second at the Masters two years ago, with his final-round collapse at Royal Lytham and St. Annes in 2012 was the closest he had got to winning one of the sport's four blue riband events, letting the Claret Jug slip from his grasp and into Ernie Els' hands. Now, Scott is Australia's first Masters champion, succeeding where two-time major winner Norman and the great Peter Thompson failed. ""Golf is a game that can humble you very quickly, and it certainly did at the British Open,"" continued the 32-year-old. ""But I've won tournaments before and I've lost tournaments before and it's going to keep happening for the rest of my life. As much as I don't want to lose tournaments, it's inevitable. ""The British Open gave me more belief than anything. No doubt, it just gave me more belief that I am good enough to win a major championship."" Scott looked to have done enough for victory when he holed an impressive birdie on the 72nd hole of the weekend to move to nine-under par and into the outright lead. But Cabrera, who held a share of the lead heading into Sunday, responded with a sublime approach shot to the final green and a playoff was required. Scott eventually emerged victorious on the second playoff hole, the par-four 10th, fulfilling the dreams of the 15-year-old who watched Norman's infamous capitulation. ""It's quite a feeling to make a couple of putts to win a tournament,"" he said. ""It's what every kid dreams about. For it to finally happen is amazing."" The Adelaide native becomes the latest player to win a major using the controversial belly putter. Els' victory over Scott was achieved using the club, while Webb Simpson and Keegan Bradley both belly putted their way to major championships. That putter, which involves golfers anchoring the club to any part of the body, has divided golf in recent months. The Royal & Ancient and the United States Golf Association, backed by the European Tour, has proposed banning anchored putting from 2016 onwards, a move opposed by the PGA and the PGA Tour. For now though, Scott has time to savor his win at Augusta, while golf's regulators come up with a belly putter solution.","Adam Scott becomes first Australian winner of the Masters .

"(CNN) -- Amid concerns over adult content popping up on its new Vine video app, Twitter appeared Tuesday to have restricted how users can share sexually explicit clips. As with Twitter, Vine users can create and search hashtags (#CNN, #news, #tech, for instance) to share posts with a wider audience or find lots of content about the same subject. By Tuesday morning, hashtags that had worked Monday -- including searches for the terms ""porn,"" ""nude,"" ""sex"" and ""naked"" -- were among those that delivered no results. That doesn't mean that pornographic content has disappeared from the Vine app. But it's no longer as easy to find, or share, huge caches of the stuff with a single click. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. Rolled out last Thursday, Vine is a mobile app that lets users create six-second video clips and share them through the app, on Twitter, or both. While Vine has already been used to post some creative videos, like virtually any Web tool that allows user-created content it has also been used for the mass display of naughty bits. The issue came to the forefront over the weekend when an explicit video appeared under the prominently displayed ""Editor's Picks"" section on the app's main page. Twitter said the video appeared due to an employee's error and it was removed. The porn issue was a public-relations stumble for Twitter and for what appears to be a quickly adopted app. Since its release, Vine has been among the most popular free apps in Apple's app store. Currently, Vine is only available on Apple mobile devices. With its restrictions, Vine's new model appears to more closely resemble the one used on Facebook-owned Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app. Salacious hashtags also deliver no results there. On Tuesday, there were still some workaround-style hashtags on Vine with which users were sharing adult videos. Presumably, Twitter might monitor and start deleting those as well.","Naughty hashtags are no longer working on Twitter's Vine video app .

"London (CNN) -- A British cyclist who was the first to come across the aftermath of a brutal murder in the French Alps last week told Thursday how he helped an injured girl and called for help. In an interview with BBC News, Brett Martin, a former Royal Air Force pilot, recounted the shocking scene he stumbled across as he went on a regular bike ride in a national park. Martin said what he found in the parking lot -- three people shot dead in a car and a fourth on the ground nearby -- was like ""a Hollywood scene."" His account came as French prosecutor Eric Maillaud and investigating Judge Michel Mollin were in Britain seeking new leads in the case. They met with Surrey Police, whose officers have been helping French investigators to search the home of two of the victims, Saad and Ikbal al-Hilli, in the town of Claygate, in the county of Surrey. Bomb squad clears suspicious items in victims' home . Speaking outside Woking police station, Maillaud said it was ""highly likely that the reasons and causes for (the crime) have their origin in this country."" ""Our presence here does not mean that there are problems between the two jurisdictions,"" said Maillaud, . ""We wish to reinforce our cooperation and understanding with hope to reach a conclusion to these horrible murders."" Rob Price, assistant chief constable for Surrey Police, stressed that his officers would do all they could to assist the French-led investigation. Maillaud said Wednesday that investigators were focused on three main areas: Saad al-Hilli's job, his links to his native Iraq, and a reported family dispute over money involving his brother. Born in Baghdad in 1962, Saad al-Hilli was a naturalized British citizen who had lived in the United Kingdom for decades. He was an engineer working at Surrey Satellite Technology, a high-tech company owned by EADS, an aerospace corporation that builds satellites. Authorities have been tight-lipped about possible perpetrators and motives in the attack, although speculation has been rife in the British media. Martin's account to the BBC shed fresh light on the grisly scene that confronted French police near Lake Annecy after the alarm was raised last Wednesday. 'Slaughter at Chevaline': More questions than answers . The first thing he saw as he cycled up the mountain road near the village of Chevaline was the bike of a French cyclist on the ground, Martin said. Then he spotted the girl, whose parents, Saad and Ikbal al-Hilli, and grandmother were subsequently identified as those shot to death in the car. She was stumbling and falling over and at first he thought she was playing, Martin told the BBC. Then he realized she was injured, and put her in the recovery position as she slipped in and out of consciousness. The car engine was still revving and wheels spinning, he said, making him fear it could move and harm the girl and the cyclist whose bike he had seen on the ground. ""At first I thought, there's been a terrible accident between a cyclist and a car, because there was a cyclist on the ground more or less in front of the car. But there were things that didn't quite match, because the cyclist's bike wasn't beside him, so as the minutes went on I started to change my opinion,"" he told the BBC. He pushed in one of the car windows, which had bullet holes in it, to turn off the engine -- and saw the bodies inside. ""I've never seen people who've been shot before for real ... but it seemed to me just like a Hollywood scene, and if someone had said 'cut' and everybody got up and walked away, that would have been it. But unfortunately it was real life. ... It became quite obvious now, taking stock, that it was a gun crime,"" he said. Realizing that whoever was responsible could still be in the area, Martin became increasingly anxious but faced a dilemma. He had no cell phone signal to call emergency services, but the girl appeared too badly injured for him to carry her down the mountain. Martin decided to leave her in a safe position and set off back down the road on his bike to summon help. He managed to flag down a car and asked the French motorist to call for help, before returning to the scene to check on the girl, who was now unconscious. He added that he was unsurprised that French police had failed to spot a second child, a 4-year-old girl, hiding in the back of the car under her dead mother's legs, for nearly eight hours. Young girl found alive among bodies in France . Martin, from Sussex in southern England, went back to France on Wednesday to retrace his route and see if new recollections came to mind. The pilot, who now works in civil aviation and has a family business in Annecy, had given a detailed statement to police immediately after the shooting, including details of vehicles that passed him on the road, he said. The 7-year-old girl he helped is now out of a medically induced coma but remains too badly injured to be questioned, Maillaud said Wednesday. She is a key witness as the only person alive who potentially saw who carried out the shooting. Her 4-year-old sister, who has been reunited with other family members, told investigators she heard noise but saw nothing. Ahmed Al-Saffar, an uncle of Ikbal al-Hilli, said Wednesday that the family, which he described as being of Iraqi-Arabic origin, was ""heartbroken by this shocking crime."" ""We are very grateful for the support provided by the British, French and Iraqi authorities during this difficult time,"" he said, in a statement released on his behalf by the UK Foreign Office. ""We hope that those responsible for the deaths of our loved ones are brought swiftly to justice."" CNN's Kirsten Dewar, Laura Smith-Spark and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","A British cyclist who was first at the scene of the shootings recounts what he saw .

"(CNN) -- At least 13 people in Turkey have been detained in connection with the deadly weekend car bombings near the Syrian border, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported Tuesday, quoting a top government official. At least 47 people died and about 100 were wounded when two explosives-laden cars blew up Saturday in the town of Reyhanli. Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay confirmed the number of detentions Tuesday and said police were looking for others who have been tied to the incident. ""Because the investigation is ongoing, we are naming neither the persons nor the organization,"" he said. Turkish government officials blame Marxists with Syrian connections for the attacks and the incident stoked concern that Turkey has gotten too involved with the Syrian crisis. ""For the time being, there is no evidence suggesting that al Qaeda was involved,"" Interior Minister Muammer Guler told Anadolu. He and other Turkish officials accuse a former Marxist terror group that they say maintains relations with Syria's intelligence services. The conflict in Syria has repeatedly spilled across the border into Turkey, prompting Turkish security forces to reinforce the frontier. At Turkey's request, the NATO military alliance deployed several Patriot missile batteries to protect Turkish border cities from the threat of Syrian missile attacks. Turkey is trying to accommodate nearly 300,000 refugees from Syria's civil war, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. The attacks fueled anger at some of the Syrians who have taken shelter in Reyhanli.

The 38-year-old clinched his fourth European Tour win, and first since triumphing at the 2011 Sicilian Open, having been tied with Chile's Felipe Aguilar and Germany's Maximilian Kieffer after the 72 regulation holes. Aguilar, also 38, bowed out at the third extra hole, and the other two matched each other par for par in the next five. Jacquelin finally broke the deadlock with a wedge to five feet, sinking the birdie putt to deny 22-year-old Kieffer his maiden top-level victory and claim the â‚¬250,000 ($327,000) first prize. It should lift the 146th-ranked player inside the top 100. ""I could not make any putts (in the play-off) but the last one dropped, which means a lot for me and my family,"" Jacquelin said on the European Tour website after taking his career earnings past â‚¬9 million ($11.8 million). ""There's another baby coming at the end of November; every time I get a baby, there's a win so I'll have a football team after a few years!"" Scotland's Marc Warren had led for most of the final day, but four bogeys in his last five holes meant he finished in a tie for fourth -- one shot away from making the playoff as he was left to rue a three-putt at 18. Sergio Garcia tied for 12th at his national event, having flown from Augusta after finishing eighth at the Masters last Sunday. Miguel Angel Jimenez, playing his first tournament since breaking his leg in a skiing accident last year, missed the halfway cut along with former major champions Michael Campbell and Jose Maria Olazabal.","Raphael Jacquelin wins Spanish Open after record-equaling ninth playoff hole .

"(CNN) -- After scouring northern Colorado by foot and air, frantically chasing a Mylar balloon for miles and repeatedly interviewing his big brother, authorities ended the search for 6-year-old Falcon Heene where it began -- at his house. 6-year-old Falcon Heene says he was hiding in a box in the attic while authorities were searching for him. He was in a box. In the attic. The whole time. ""I played with my toys and took a nap,"" Falcon told a group of reporters outside his home Thursday afternoon. ""He says he was hiding in the attic,"" said Falcon's father, meteorologist Richard Heene, clutching his son. ""He says it's because I yelled at him."" ""I'm sorry I yelled at him,"" added Heene, tearfully hugging the boy. In a later interview with CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Falcon said he heard his parents call for him from the garage. When asked by his father on-air why he didn't respond, the boy replied, ""You guys said we did this for the show."" When the father was pressed by Wolf Blitzer, who was filling in for King, to explain what his son meant, he became uncomfortable, finally saying he was ""appalled"" by the questions, and then adding that Falcon was likely referring to all the media coverage.  Watch the Heenes talk about the ordeal on CNN's Larry King Live » . Authorities said they believe the case was genuine. The situation grabbed the nation's attention early Thursday afternoon, after authorities reported that the experimental helium balloon was set adrift with the 6-year-old apparently riding in it. Heene said the family was in the early stages of working on the balloon -- a ""3D low-altitude vehicle"" -- when the contraption and the boy went missing. His brother had said he watched Falcon get into the balloon before he untied the tethers, setting it free. Heene later said Falcon was videotaped getting into the vessel by his brother, but ""obviously he got out."" Once it was untethered, the saucer-like craft flew eastward from the Heenes' neighborhood, though officials couldn't immediately confirm how fast it was going.  Watch the balloon float thousands of feet over Colorado » . Authorities said the silver balloon, 20-feet long and 5-feet high, at times reached 7,000 feet above the ground while adrift. It was found more than 90 minutes later in a field near Colorado Springs. The story took a turn when ABC said that Falcon's parents, science enthusiasts Richard and Mayumi Heene, were featured on the 100th episode of ABC's prime-time program ""Wife Swap"" in March 2009. According to the network's Web site, the Heene family ""devote(s) their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm."" Richard Heene is a meteorologist and former television weatherman who has submitted to CNN iReports accounts of his sons helping him chase Hurricane Gustav, among other contributions. iReport.com: Heene family chases a storm . Rescuers from several counties followed the saucer-like vessel until it made a soft landing some 90 miles away. Officials rushed to the scene of the landing, smacking the metallic balloon until it deflated. They looked inside -- no Falcon. At that point, there were two possibilities: Either Falcon never got in the balloon, or he fell out. Authorities began to fear the worst after reports surfaced that a box possibly carrying Falcon may have fallen off the balloon. A Weld County Sheriff's deputy had said he saw an object fall off the balloon somewhere over Platteville, Colorado, which is in the search area. There was no box attached when the balloon landed at 1:35 p.m.  See map of balloon's trip » . The widespread worries prompted the Colorado Air National Guard to deploy a UH 60 Black Hawk helicopter, with plans to launch a second one equipped with night vision if necessary. The search, which initially focused on Weld County, covered ""the entire flight plan, from the Fort Collins area down to the Denver International Airport area,"" Col. Mark Riccardi said. But a little while later, Falcon turned up at home. Larimer County Sheriff James Alderden said it's not uncommon for children to seek cover when they realize they're the subject of a massive search. ""They hide because they think they are in trouble,"" he said. ""What was confusing was the eyewitness who said [Falcon] climbed into the apparatus, which was not the case,"" Alderden said, referring to the boy's brother. The sheriff said the brother was interviewed several times by investigators and that he was consistent with his story. Marc Friedland, the family's next-door neighbor, said he saw Richard Heene working on the giant Mylar balloon in the backyard.  Learn more about airborne balloons » . ""Basically, the whole family was out there and they were working with it,"" he said. ""When I came back is when I found out that the event happened.""

Friedland described his neighbors as ""a great family."" ""They're unusual, yes, of course. He's sort of a scientist-slash-inventor.

"(CNN) -- An Egyptian judge sentenced 21 people to death Saturday for their roles in a football game riot last year, a ruling that sparked deadly clashes between security forces and relatives of the convicted. The Port Said football incident left 74 people dead and 1,000 others injured. Soon after the sentencing in the nation's worst stadium disaster, protests erupted outside the prison in the northeastern port city. Clashes outside Port Said prison left at least 20 civilians and two soldiers dead and dozens injured, a hospital official told state TV. The armed forces sent troops to secure public buildings and restore calm in Port Said, according to state media. The fatal clashes started after some relatives attempted to storm the building to free their loved ones, Brig. Gen. Osama Ismail, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, told state-run Nile TV. Crowds outside the prison fired guns and hurled rocks at the security forces, who in turn used tear gas to disperse the crowd, Ismail said. ""There is a state of anger on the streets of Port Said, and the security forces are on high alert,"" Nile TV reported. The sentences were handed down in a packed courtroom in Cairo as victims' relatives and those convicted wept. ""I thank God that justice is back in the courts of Egypt. Many mothers will sleep sound tonight knowing justice is served,"" the mother of Mustafa Issam, who was killed in the riots, told Nile TV by phone. The sentences must be reviewed by Egypt's highest religious authority, who will return his opinion to the court March 9. On that day, an additional 54 defendants in the case will also be sentenced, the judge said. Dubbed the ""massacre at Port Said"" by Egyptian media, the riot broke out on February 1, 2012, after Port Said-based Al-Masry defeated Cairo's Al-Ahly, 3-1. When the clashes began, about 22,000 people were inside the stadium, which can hold up to 25,000 people. About 2,000 Al-Ahly fans were at the game, authorities said. Fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs. Many of those who died fell from the bleachers during the melee inside the stadium, while others suffocated. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife sparked the riots, though witnesses said tension was building through the game with Port Said fans throwing bottles and rocks at players on the Cairo team. During Egypt's revolution that ended with the toppling of Hosni Mubarak, football fans became a powerful force for political change, according to CNN contributor James Montague, who wrote the book ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone."" Even so, the riots occurred at a time when Egypt was struggling with a security vacuum following Mubarak's ouster. In the hours after the riot in Port Said, protesters in Cairo chanted, ""Down with military rule."" At the time, the secretary-general of the Muslim Brotherhood party blamed Egypt's military for the deaths. Egypt's interior ministry blamed fans for provoking police. Witnesses said police did little to try to quell the clashes.","NEW: Clashes outside Port Said prison leave 22 dead .

"(CNN) -- Six teenagers and one of their fathers were found guilty by a Dutch court Monday of the killing of an amateur football linesman last year. The 50-year-old adult was sentenced to six years in jail, with five of the teenagers given the maximum sentence of two years in youth detention. The other will serve one year. Richard Nieuwenhuizen, 41, was set upon by his seven attackers after officiating at a youth match between his son's football team, SC Buitenboys and Nieuw Sloten in Almere, near Amsterdam on December 2, 2012. The father of three walked away after the beating, but later collapsed and died in hospital the next day. ""The court finds that there is sufficient legal proof that all suspects had a share in the very powerful and violent kicks and kicks to the head and upper body,"" read the ruling in finding the seven guilty of manslaughter, public violence and brutality. An eighth defendant, a 15-year-old, was cleared of the killing but sentenced to a 30 days detention for assaulting the linesman and the SC Buitenboys goalkeeper. The defense case had claimed that a rare medical disorder contributed to Nieuwenhuizen's death, but this was rejected by judges, who ruled it was as a result of ""serious violence against him."" The tragic incident sent shockwaves through Dutch football, which is renowned for its production of talented young players through amateur youth system, and made headlines across the world. FIFA President Sepp Blatter sent his condolences -- all 33,000 amateur games across the Netherlands the following weekend were canceled -- and a minute's silence was also observed at all Dutch professional league matches. At Nieuwenhuizen's funeral, hundreds lined the streets to pay their respects, with players from SC Buitenboys, bedecked in their blue and white colors, forming a guard of honor as his hearse entered the crematorium in Almere. Four teenagers were immediately arrested almost immediately after the attack, with three others and the father of one of the Nieuw Sloten players held a week later. The trial in Lelystad began on May 29, with several members of Nieuwenhuizen's family in attendance as a panel of judges heard the evidence.","Guilty verdicts over kicking to death of Dutch football official .

"(CNN) -- Actress Kristin Chenoweth started Maddie's Corner, an organization that supports animals in need. Chenoweth recently sat down with CNN's Sonya Hamasaki to talk about CNN Heroes and how she promotes the bond between people and their pets. Below are excerpts from that interview. Sonya Hamasaki: What is Maddie's Corner? Kristin Chenoweth: I started Maddie's Corner probably five years ago. My idea was animals helping people who help animals. Maybe an animal needs to be matched to the right home of someone in need, and then (that) ultimately helps the animal, too. We do a lot with local shelters that need money for spays; getting money for spays is a big issue. I'd like to see animals get their shots, so we help with that. We help with adoption. We all need to give how we can, but in my hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and my new hometowns of Los Angeles and New York, we work locally with people and animals who need help. Hamasaki: What inspired you to start Maddie's Corner? Chenoweth: Animals inspire me every day. I grew up in Oklahoma around a lot of animals, and a lot of my relatives are farmers and ranchers. I have a lot of respect for all kinds and what they can bring to our lives. I finally became one of those New Yorkers that got a little white fluffy dog. I never thought that she'd take over my life, but she's given me such joy and she's made me so happy. I love show business, but this dog basically reminds me of what's important. My family loves her; my mom and dad look at her like it's their own grandchild. Through Maddie's Corner, I've gotten to meet other dogs that are in need. Just recently I got to do a morning show in New York, and it was adoption day. I got to bring a dog on, and that dog got adopted that day. There are still so many animals in need, and adoption should not be ruled out. Hamasaki: What's the inspiration behind the name? Chenoweth: Madeline Kahn Chenoweth is my dog. Madeline Kahn was a big hero of mine, a wonderful actress and singer who actually passed away of cancer. She was an artistic, funny lady, someone who inspired me and is one of my personal heroes. So it seemed right to have a charity and a dog named after her. Hamasaki: Why did you get involved in CNN Heroes? Chenoweth: I look forward every year to finding out who the CNN Heroes are, because they're everyday people. It has become even more important to me because I have a cousin who is serving for our country in Afghanistan. Those people, it goes without saying, are our heroes. It's become more important to me to find out more about our military; more about everyday people; more about a place called the Love Kitchen, where sisters feed the homeless; more about women who are helping animals. Humanity's an amazing thing, and that's what CNN Heroes celebrates. That's what they show through this tribute show, and that's why I'm so proud to be involved.","Kristin Chenoweth started a nonprofit that works with local animal shelters .

"(CNN) -- Unsteady cables and stronger-than-expected winds added drama, but Nik Wallenda's high-wire walk above a Florida highway looked like a walk in the park Tuesday. The 600-foot stroll was on a cable strung 180 feet above U.S. Highway 41 along the Sarasota, Florida, bay front. The 34-year-old, who hails from multiple generations of high-flying daredevils, was not wearing a safety tether, and there was no net below to catch him if he fell. ""Props to my great-grandfather Karl Wallenda, because I can almost guarantee you he would have stopped in the middle of this cable and have done a headstand,"" he said near the halfway point. Daredevil completes walk across Niagara Falls . His great-grandfather Karl Wallenda died at 73, attempting to walk between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978. Last June, Wallenda captured the nation's attention during his 25-minute agonizing amble above the roaring rapids of Niagara Falls. He carried his passport in his pocket for that historic walk from the United States to Canada, but this one was in his hometown. ""I'm risking my life on every single one of them, so there's no difference"" the younger aerialist said as he walked. ""My great-grandfather did many amazing walks around the world. The one that took his life was minuscule in comparison."" Thousands watched from 180 feet below and television cameras broadcast it live to the world, a stunt intended to promote Wallenda's performance with his wife and other family members at Circus Sarasota. Since the permit allowed the highway to be closed for just an hour, Wallenda's crew had just 15 minutes to adjust the stabilizing cables. Wallenda complained at times that it was ""really sloppy."" ""Holy crap,"" he said. ""Come on guys, it's horrible."" Despite the danger, he kept calm and joked with his father: ""Who do I need to spank when I get down?""

"Washington (CNN) -- Documents set to be released this week by the IRS watchdog show that the agency targeted tea party organizations and other groups focused on government spending and the federal debt that were seeking tax-exempt status. Obama: Alleged IRS political targeting 'outrageous' First hearings on IRS targeting set for Friday . The IRS also applied extra scrutiny to applicants with statements that ""criticize how the country is run"" or that sought to educate the public on how to ""make America a better place to live,"" designations that would have included conservative political groups looking to apply for 501(c)(4) status. Timeline: IRS wrestled with which groups to scrutinize . Those disclosures are included in the appendix of an inspector general's report, obtained by CNN, that has caused widespread anger among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as conservative groups. Bipartisan outrage over IRS targeting . So, what's a 501(c)(4)? A ""501(c)(4)"" organization is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code if it meets two criteria: the ""organization must not be organized for profit and must be operated exclusively to promote social welfare."" To meet the IRS social welfare requirements, ""an organization must operate primarily to further the common good and general welfare of the people of the community,"" The IRS further defines this critical criterion under section 501(c)(4) as ""primarily for the purpose of bringing about civic betterment and social improvements."" But the IRS has said that ""the promotion of social welfare does not include direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office."" That said, ""a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization may engage in some political activities, so long as that is not its primary activity."" And, according to the IRS, a 501(c)(4) may also engage in lobbying. For example, guidance from the IRS available online suggests that an organization is likely to be deemed tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4) if its educational activities are conducted in a non-partisan manner and if the organization is not affiliated with a political party -- even though the organization's philosophy on the issues it is providing education about is broadly consistent with the view of a major political party. The same guidance also points to past rulings by the IRS that allowed tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(4) for ""organizations primarily engaged in advocating a particular point of view on an issue of public concern, through lobbying and public education."" The same guidance points out that an organization exempt under section 501(c)(4) ""may engage in political campaign activities if those activities are not the organization's primary activity.""

"(CNN) -- In his native Brazil, Neymar is being counted on to lead the South American nation to World Cup glory on home soil next year. If he can score the kind of goal he did Saturday in the Confederations Cup opener, then Brazil's chances of claiming a record-extending sixth title will surely increase. Neymar, hailed as the ""modern successor"" to Pele, netted with a stunning half volley in the third minute to help Brazil beat Japan 3-0 in Group A. Paulinho and Jo added the other goals in the second half. ""It all happened in a flash,"" Neymar said. ""I connected full on and happily the ball found the target. I am very happy to score and help Brazil to achieve a victory."" Brazilian fans probably weren't the only ones celebrating after Neymar's strike. Barcelona supporters must have been pleased, too, since the 21-year-old will team up with four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi at the Camp Nou next season. The win, Brazil's second straight after a 3-0 victory against France this week in a friendly, might lift some of the gloom surrounding the national team. Even after topping France, Brazil had won just two of its past seven matches and manager Luiz Felipe Scolari was being criticized for his less than free flowing style of play. Neymar wasn't immune to criticism, either. ""What mattered most was the result and this continued the tactical evolution of the team,"" Scolari said. With all eyes on Brazil to see how the nation hosts the World Cup dress rehearsal, the build-up to the game, though, was marred by protests across the country. Thousands took to the streets to protest against an increase in public transportation costs and there was frustration about the lack of investment in health and education. In Brasilia a road leading to the stadium this week was reportedly blocked by hundreds of people who were unhappy with the costs of staging the Confederations Cup and World Cup, and protests continued outside the stadium Saturday. Preparations for the 2014 showpiece itself haven't been smooth. Work to stadiums fell behind schedule and last month managers of the stadium in Salvador said human error was partly to blame for causing a tear in the roof. On the eve of the Confederations Cup, FIFA president Sepp Blatter -- booed when introduced before the game -- downplayed concerns. On the field, Brazil had little trouble with Asian champion Japan. Japan became the first nation to qualify for the World Cup but its defeat Saturday followed a 4-0 loss to Brazil in a friendly in October. Even Neymar's harsher critics would have been silenced after his opener. Marcelo struck a diagonal ball to Fred, who chested it down for his strike partner yards outside the box. Neymar pounced and left Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima with no chance. Keisuke Honda, a key performer in Japan's qualifying campaign, made a good run into the box in the ninth minute but his shot from the left side sailed over the bar. Kawashima denied Fred after good link up play with Neymar before Paulinho realistically settled the game in the 48th minute. Kawashima got a hand to his low shot but not enough of it to keep it out of the net. Japan almost replied straight away but Shinji Okazaki was off target when supplied with a good cross from Hiroshi Kiyotake. Neymar gave way to Lucas in the 74th minute because of a slight injury and Brazil made it three when Jo slotted home from Oscar's pass in injury time. On Sunday, world and European champion Spain plays Uruguay in Group B and Mexico faces Italy in Group A.","Neymar's half-volley gave Brazil the early lead against Japan in the Confederations Cup .

"(CNN) -- Despite not kicking a ball, Arsenal were the biggest winners on Wednesday night as Chelsea drew 2-2 with Tottenham Hotspur in a game that football fans almost forgot. This was the game in hand that both Chelsea and Spurs had long seen as decisive in their bid to finish in the Premier League's top four and so secure Champions League qualification -- but the long-awaited fixture was all but ignored for large parts of Wednesday. The news earlier in the day that Sir Alex Ferguson was to step down as Manchester United manager after nearly 27 years in the job dominated the minds of football followers who would otherwise have been focusing on a decisive clash in West London. As if to underline the point, both Chelsea boss Rafa Benitez and Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas found their usual pre-match interviews sidetracked by their thoughts on the Scot, who has amassed 38 trophies during his time with United. Despite their differences over the years, Ferguson's long-standing rival Benitez -- who used to manage United's traditional rivals Liverpool -- was magnanimous in his praise for the 71-year-old. ""I have always liked to compete against him as a manager,"" the Spaniard, who may go down in history as the last coach to beat Ferguson following Chelsea's 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Sunday, told Sky Sports television. ""As a person, I wish him health in his retirement and I hope he enjoys his football in a different way."" Meanwhile, the Portuguese Villas-Boas, who was returning to his former club, said the EPL had lost one of its ""most charismatic managers"" and ""the reference point in terms of coaches and being a successful manager"". Shortly after, it was back to work for the pair as both sides continued to work on the final chapters of a thrilling race to see who will secure a coveted Champions League berth for next season. Hosts Chelsea knew that victory would all but guarantee them a place in the competition, which they won last year, while fifth-placed Spurs needed the three points to climb above great rivals Arsenal to ensure that their Champions League destiny is in their own hands. Nonetheless, the draw played out best for the Gunners -- their 67 points one better than Spurs' tally -- with Arsenal knowing that victories in their remaining fixtures against Wigan (home) and Newcastle (away) will guarantee them a top-four finish. Chelsea, who travel to Aston Villa on Saturday before finishing at home against Everton, started the Stamford Bridge clash the brighter, taking an early lead when the Brazilian Oscar converted Gary Cahill's flick-on from a tenth-minute corner. The Blues continued to pour forward but were undone after 26 minutes when Emmanuel Adebayor, who has found goals hard to come by, ran 50 yards unchallenged before curling home from outside the area for his third Premier League strike of the season. Ramires restored Chelsea's lead shortly before half-time as he finished off a sweeping move and the same player had the chance to kill off Spurs' Champions League hopes in the second half only to slip at the crucial moment after being teed up by Juan Mata. With just 10 minutes left, substitute Gylfi Sigurdsson leveled for the visitors after a cute Adebayor backheel but despite a late free-kick from Gareth Bale, Spurs had to settle for a draw that may ultimately seem disappointing. ""It was good to get the point,"" Villas-Boas said later. ""We have to do our job and hope that somebody else slips up. The Premier League is absolutely unpredictable and hopefully it can fall our way."" His side play at Stoke on Sunday before hosting Sunderland on 19 May, the final day of the EPL season, and are likely to need two victories to sneak into the Champions League places. Such matters are of course trivial for Ferguson, who steered United to the Premier League title -- the 13th of his reign -- in his final season in charge, so securing yet another crack at Europe's best clubs for the three-time continental champions. In Spain's La Liga, Real Madrid ensured that leaders Barcelona must wait a little while longer before sealing the championship. Jose Mourinho's side thrashed nine-man Malaga 6-2 at the Bernabeu to reach 80 points for the season, eight behind Barca with only three games now left for Madrid. Barcelona have a game in hand over their closest rivals (and defending champions), who shared their goals between six players -- with Cristiano Ronaldo, who missed a penalty, inevitably among those on the scoresheet. Arguably the biggest news of the night came with the publication of the team line-ups, with defender Pepe - who has fallen out with Mourinho - absent from the squad. ""Pepe's absence is the decision of the manager,"" Raul Albiol, who replaced the Portuguese and opened the scoring, told Canal Plus. ""What we have to do is work and be united. We have three weeks left until the end of the season and we need to work until the end."" Earlier in the evening, Atletico Madrid guaranteed their place in next season's Champions League with a 3-1 win over Celta Vigo - a result that means they will finish the season in the top three. The same reward for a hard season was achieved by Napoli in Italy, who secured the Serie A runner-up when beating Bologna 3-0. Edinson Cavani stretched his lead atop the scoring charts to 27 goals as Napoli ensured they can no longer be caught by AC Milan, who sunk Pescara 4-0 to stay in the Champions League hunt. Massimiliano Allegri's side face a nervous last two games of the season, at home to Roma and away to Siena, as they try to beat Fiorentina to third place in Italy, which guarantees a qualifying place in Europe's premier club competition.","Chelsea draw 2-2 at home to Spurs in English Premier League .

Pumping his fist in the air, Wallenda sprinted the last few steps on the wire. After touching down on Canadian soil, he embraced his family, grinning ear to ear. The tense 1,800-foot journey took 25 minutes, according to CNN affiliate CTV. ""I'm extremely blessed to be where I am,"" Wallenda said after stepping onto Canadian soil. Gotta watch: Tightrope stunts . To abide with immigration law, he had a U.S. passport tucked in a plastic bag in his pocket during the trip, according to the affiliate. Two border guards were waiting as soon as he stepped on Canadian soil to ensure he had the correct paperwork. ""It hasn't sunk in yet,"" he told ABC, which broadcast the event. ""This is something that I've played over and over in my mind for the last 20 years, and to finally be here at this point, it is very surreal. As I said as I left that wire, I'm extremely blessed to be where I am."" Wallenda described the difficulties of dealing with the wind and heavy mist from the roaring falls. ""It's all about the concentration, the focus, and it all goes back to the training. You know, in the middle of the wire at one point, I just started thinking about great-grandfather and paying tribute to him and all the walks that he did,"" he said. His great-grandfather Karl Wallenda was killed at the age of 73, attempting to walk between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978. When asked by ABC how he planned to top the walk over Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he hopes to become the first person in the world to walk a tightrope across the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. Thousands were on hand to watch Wallenda teeter his way on the 2-inch-wide wire over Horseshoe Falls toward Canada. He wore a harness at the insistence of those sponsoring the event, officials say, despite what he said was his desire to walk without a safety rig. Nik Wallenda, 121 feet in the air: 'It's extremely important to never let your mind wander' Wearing a red and black rain jacket and a balance pole around his neck, Wallenda appeared calm and focused as he took small steps, gingerly placing one foot in front of the other. Wallenda, who hails from multiple generations of high-flying daredevils, had a near fall as he stumbled on a tightrope above Baltimore's Inner Harbor earlier this year. ""It's been a dream of mine for a long time,"" Wallenda told CNN before the Niagara Falls attempt. ""I'm one of those people who always tries to overachieve. I want to do more. I want to do bigger things."" Other daredevils have tried their luck walking over Niagara, but farther downstream and not since 1896. More than 10 people have attempted to cross different parts of Niagara Falls, some in barrels, one on a bicycle and even one with a washing machine strapped to his back. Wallenda is the first person in recent history to cross over the actual falls, braving the thick mist and roaring waters, according to the affiliate.

"(WIRED)  -- Blockbuster videogame heroes have tamed the Wild West, repelled alien invasions and driven the Nazis from Normandy. But can they fight off ""Angry Birds""? The popular mobile app hit 50 million downloads last year, and the iPad version made waves last week at the DICE Summit here when it was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' prestigious Game of the Year award. ""Angry Birds"" didn't win -- that honor went to ""Mass Effect 2"" -- but it was the first time a smartphone game had broken free of the Best Mobile Game ghetto and moved up into the big leagues. With a reported development cost of about $150,000, the addictive fowl-flinging game is racking up ungodly profits. Ironically, it's quite likely that a great portion of those dollars are coming not from your mom and other casual gamers but from hard-core players more likely to get deep into Halo than to spend a few minutes with an iPhone time-waster. At the annual confab of game executives, eye-opening stats outlined the evolving habits of hard-core gamers, who are spending a surprising amount of time playing games on smartphones and tablets. WIRED: Videogames need auteurs, but good luck finding them . Anita Frazier, an analyst with the NPD Group, said game console owners spend more time playing mobile games than do those in the general population. And 38 percent of people who play social networking games like ""FarmVille"" are ""established console gamers,"" she said. ""Is there anybody in this room who really thought they would have been spending a lot of time playing social network games?"" Frazier asked the audience. The surprising popularity of casual games among even the hardest of the hard-core foreshadows a sea change for an industry that over the years has grown to resemble Hollywood, complete with star directors, creaking franchises and budgets that dwarf the annual operating costs of a small city. As indie and casual titles lure gamers away from powerful consoles, some big gamemakers are scrambling to imitate the success of Facebook and iPhone games. EA Sports boss Peter Moore's assertion that the gaming industry is ""standing on a burning oil platform"" kept coming up at DICE. The metaphor is clear: Stand still and it's certain death; jump into the chilly waters and you just might live. Everyone seems to agree that it's time to jump. But nobody quite knows what direction to swim. ""I think it's going to be crazy in the next few years,"" said BioWare CEO Ray Muzyka in his DICE keynote. ""A lot of existing [industry] players are going to have to adapt in order to survive and to thrive."" The social blockbuster . Travis Boatman, vice president of Electronic Arts' mobile business, said that contrary to the popular belief that mobile games are played in brief bursts while on the go, about half of all mobile game time is spent at home. By porting hard-core titles like survival-horror game ""Dead Space"" to iOS, EA is pursuing Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners who would rather sit on their couch and play with their iPads instead. ""I don't think it's all about us quitting our jobs and making 'Angry Birds' and 'FarmVille' clones,"" said Jade Raymond, managing director of Ubisoft Toronto and producer of ""Assassin's Creed,"" in an interview with Wired.com. Raymond, who referenced Moore's dire predictions in her own DICE speech, said she wants any new gaming franchise created by her company to include robust social features that connect gamers with friends. WIRED: When game developers go Indie, everybody wins . Games shouldn't be the water-cooler discussion topic but the water cooler itself, the hub around which socialization occurs, she said. That's already the case with ""FarmVille,"" but not with the type of $60 Blu-ray games that directors like Raymond create. She pointed to rival Activision's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops,"" which allows players to bet in-game currency on the outcomes of online matches, as an interesting example of how to build a better blockbuster. ""The whole wager system ... adds a whole new dimension to multiplayer gameplay,"" she said. Both Ubisoft and Electronic Arts have made efforts at pushing their big game franchises onto Facebook, hoping that snagging social gamers and getting them interested in the series will get them to spend big bucks on the blockbusters. Ubisoft rolled out a Facebook game for ""Assassin's Creed,"" while EA crafted a social game based on its upcoming role-playing game ""Dragon Age II."" Besides mixing social features into big games, publishers are likely to pursue core gamers who'd rather play on mobile devices. EA's Boatman says the success of complex iPad games like ""Dead Space"" and Epic's ""Infinity Blade"" show that many traditional gamers are getting sucked in by robust, console-style content sold at a cheaper price on mobile platforms. End of the cycle . With ""Assassin's Creed,"" Ubisoft's Raymond oversaw the launch of the biggest new game franchise of the era, one that has sold 19 million copies since 2007. But she's conscious of the fact that the game market is getting squeezed at the top. ""To be one of those big blockbusters that's really profitable is very hard,"" she said. ""You have to be in the top five."" WIRED: Farm wars -- how Facebook games harvest big bucks . Not the best odds. Raymond's plan to integrate social features into her games a la ""Call of Duty"" seems to be a push to get into that top tier again. But for all but the biggest publishers, the top may not be worth shooting for anymore. Mark Cerny, a game design consultant and creator of classics like ""Marble Madness"" and ""Crash Bandicoot,"" said in his DICE speech that the future of $50 million blockbuster games is ""looking a little shaky."" If Raymond's math is right, Cerny is understating the situation. ""There aren't many of these high-budget games,"" he said. Only about 60 games sold more than 1 million units last year, according to Cerny, and a game produced on a relatively thrifty $20 million budget has a much better chance of being profitable in that environment. But he's not sure publishers can staunch the spending spree. ""There's no intrinsic value to a $50 million game,"" Cerny said. He likened the situation to Hollywood, where the cost of making summer tent-pole films has spiraled upward in the last decade. ""Waterworld"" was widely mocked for its $175 million budget in 1995, but that kind of money is routinely spent on big films today. The trouble, Cerny said, is that the games industry has learned how to spend big gobs of money just like those movie moguls. ""In 1994, if someone had given me $20 million, I would have had no idea how to spend it,"" he said, but game teams have become bloated with superspecialized jobs these days. To pare these groups back to only the essential members would be a daunting task, he said, but there's a silver lining: The rapid advance of game console technology seems to have slowed down. New game machines won't materialize for a while, and anything that comes out probably won't be as radical a leap in power as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 were over the previous generation of consoles. ""We can take time now to learn our craft,"" said Cerny. ""To learn what is important to spend money on, and what isn't."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

"(CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder said on Friday he had assigned two U.S. attorneys to lead investigations into the possible leaking of state secrets. ""The unauthorized disclosure of classified information can compromise the security of this country and all Americans, and it will not be tolerated,"" he said in a statement. Holder assigned U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald C. Machen Jr., a Democratic appointee, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein, a holdover GOP appointee, to lead the investigations. Analysts: 'The ship of state always leaks,' but damage is less certain . ""These two highly respected and experienced prosecutors will be directing separate investigations currently being conducted by the FBI. I have every confidence in their abilities to doggedly follow the facts and the evidence in the pursuit of justice wherever it leads,"" said Holder. Earlier Friday, President Barack Obama strongly rejected claims that his White House has deliberately leaked secrets to the media, saying the idea was ""offensive"" and would put Americans at risk. Some Republicans, led by veteran Sen. John McCain of Arizona, alleged that the White House must be knowingly involved because of the nature of the leaked information. But Obama pushed back angrily as he was questioned on the issue at a news conference, saying that he had ""zero tolerance"" for such leaks and that those responsible would ""suffer consequences."" ""The notion that the White House would purposely release classified national security information is offensive, it's wrong, and people, I think, need to have a better sense of how I approach this office and how the people around me approach this office,"" he said. ""We are dealing with issues that can touch on the safety and security of the American people -- our families or our military or our allies -- and so we don't play with that."" Intelligence leaks are a source of consistent frustration for his administration as they have been for others, he said, and the White House will carry out ""thorough investigations."" In response, McCain said Obama was distancing himself from the controversy. ""What the president did not unequivocally say today is that none of the classified or highly sensitive information recently leaked to the media came from the White House,"" McCain said. ""I continue to call on the president to immediately appoint a special counsel to fully investigate and, where necessary, prosecute these gravely serious breaches of our national security."" A report in The New York Times last week that provided classified details of what it described as a U.S cyberattack targeting Iran's nuclear centrifuge program sparked the bipartisan outrage. Obama also repeated the statements made by the writers of the articles in question that the White House was not the source of their information. Other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and Obama's involvement in ""kill lists"" against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. The public airing of details surrounding a recently disrupted bomb plot in Yemen by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula also angered intelligence and national security officials. Congressional leaders said earlier Friday that those responsible for endangering national security by leaking classified information to the media should be sent to jail. Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, said that it was not yet known who was behind the leaks but that someone ""committed a crime that is having serious consequences to our national security."" Bipartisan efforts are needed to identify whoever is responsible for the leaks, involving a cyberwarfare program against Iran and other intelligence matters, and ""make sure that leaker goes to jail,"" he said. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House panel, echoed Rogers' call for the leaker to be ""held accountable."" Speaking in the House on Friday, Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama asked, ""where is the outrage from the White House about these leaks?"" He called for the White House ""to get off the campaign trail, show leadership, do the president's job and aggressively pursue the leakers of America's state secrets."" Leaks not only compromise national security efforts, they discourage allies from trusting in the United States, Brooks said. ""It's time for the president to plug the holes and protect America's national security,"" he said. Rogers said Friday that the recent leaks are ""a hundred times the magnitude"" of those in the Valerie Plame case and that ""someone needs to pay a price for this crime."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, was convicted in 2007 in connection with the leaking of CIA officer Plame's identity -- information that was technically classified, though Cheney later implied that information had been declassified. Ruppersberger said it was vital that bipartisan efforts were made to ""follow the facts wherever they go"" but reiterated that the source of the information was not known. ""These leaks have been occurring more and more,"" he said, adding that they were the worst he had seen in nearly 10 years on the intelligence panel. The leaks could come from within Congress or the executive branch, he acknowledged. The Intelligence Committee leaders met Thursday with FBI Director Robert Mueller, whose agency is investigating the leaks, according to legislators. Specifically, the FBI has launched an investigation into apparent leaks of classified information involving the cyberwarfare program against Iran, a U.S. official said this week. The agency is also investigating the thwarted Yemen plot, according to Mueller. In its report, The New York Times said that since shortly after he became president, Obama has ordered cyberattacks targeting computers that run Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. It attributed the information to participants in the program. McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, alleged that the White House authorized the leaks for political gain. ""These leaks clearly were not done in the interest of national security or to reveal corrupt or illegal actions about which the public has a right to know, as in the case of legitimate whistleblowers,"" McCain said. ""It is difficult to escape the conclusion that these recent leaks of highly classified information, all of which have the effect of making the president look strong and decisive on national security in the middle of his re-election campaign, have a deeper political motivation."" The White House pushed back, with spokesman Jay Carney saying that ""this administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations."" CNN's Terry Frieden contriobuted to this report.","Attorney General Holder: Prosecutors to ""doggedly follow the facts""

"(CNN) -- GQ summed it up with one word: ""No."" But, yes, the Internet has been buzzing about a new movement in men's fashion. A movement so horrible it sort of makes me want to have a ""movement"" of my own. Though, that might just be bad tilapia. Here, we're talking about leggings. For men. Also known as meggings. With an M. And that's how you know something might possibly be a bad idea -- when you have to gender-specify the word with a different first letter. Like a ""murse."" There's actually a lot of gray area when it comes to the man purse. It's practical as hell. But it's also ... well ... a man-purse. And some guys have a problem calling it that. George Carlin once said, ""If you can't handle the word, don't even carry the bag. It's a purse. I got one. What's the big deal?"" Then he went into a delightfully raunchy joke about somebody's mother. I miss George. A lot. Nevertheless, in regards to meggings, GQ isn't buying what Drunk Fashion God is selling. And, mind you, there really is a Drunk Fashion God. He's the same guy who, 20 years ago, gave us Zubaz. And his most recent project is outfitting Justin Bieber. Drunk Fashion God also happens to be good friends with Simply Can't Be Bothered Fashion God, who I pray to every time I put on another worn-out plaid flannel shirt. He always responds back with, ""That'll do."" So, I'm certainly not one to judge. I pretty much look like a homeless man, and when I go to a nice function, I step it up to homeless man who happened to find a navy blazer on the sidewalk. Inevitably, somebody will say, ""Oh, you clean up nicely!"" And then I spend 30 minutes stuffing my face and growling at people in the buffet line. But, how could I know if meggings were for me unless I actually tried them on? I may not be very trendy, but I do have an open mind. And for the sake of quality investigative journalism I was originally going to don them for an entire day in public and report back on the experience. However, when it came time to actually pull the trigger, I figured there's no way I could, in good conscience, buy, wear, and subsequently return something that spent more than three hours tightly hugging my gonads. ""Sir, was there anything wrong with these?"" ""WAS there? No."" So, instead I just sat around the house watching SportsCenter in a pair of old long johns. And you know what? I'm in. Seriously. This is pure quality. Maybe not as a fashion statement that I'd proudly wear out to a symphony or even, say, the VD clinic, but I simply couldn't be more comfortable than I was in a T-shirt and tights. Of course, these long johns also had the absolutely, positively, no-questions-asked requisite ""escape hatch."" So, you couldn't really bust them out in public anyway. Thus, I'm not sure they officially qualifying as meggings. Still, though. I get it. And so do a lot of other people. But meggings aren't just about pure comfort. Otherwise, society would simply give them the sweatpants treatment: You'd see a guy, long past the age of maturity, walking around town in a pair of tights and you'd say, ""Yup. That man loves Arena Football."" But that's not the case. The reason everyone online is talking about these things is because meggings have recently become a legitimate fashion trend. And that's where we have to agree to disagree. This can't happen. It all just seems a little too Euro-weird, and any mildly-rugged dude knows he's engaging in questionable taste if he does something that makes Christiano Ronaldo say, ""Yes. This I like."" But, sadly, meggings may have actually started right here in America. Tom Teodorczuk of The Telegraph in the U.K. wrote, ""The bad news is they are on their way to Britain: Uniqlo is already selling them on its British website, and their success in New York is seen as an indication they will also prove popular here."" So, perhaps we'll never really understand where it all started. But from skinny jeans to meggings, the only thing we know for sure (but not really) is that the world's collective sperm count is slowly being compromised in the name of men's fashion. And as these sexy hipsters ultimately fail to multiply, future generations will arise from the great cradle of loose-fitting sweatpants. The only real winner will be Arena Football.","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly, offbeat look at items trending online .

"(CNN) -- A Minnesota middle school student, with the backing of the American Civil Liberties Union, is suing her school district over a search of her Facebook and e-mail accounts by school employees. The 12-year-old sixth grade student, identified in court documents only as R.S., was on two occasions punished for statements she made on her Facebook account, and was also pressured to divulge her password to school officials, the complaint states. ""R.S. was intimidated, frightened, humiliated and sobbing while she was detained in the small school room"" as she watched a counselor, a deputy, and another school employee pore over her private communications. The lawsuit claims that her First Amendment rights were violated by employees at Minnewaska Area Middle School, in west-central Minnesota, as well as her Fourth Amendment rights regarding unreasonable search and seizure. The Minnewaska School District denies any wrongdoing. ""The district did not violate R.S.'s civil rights, and disputes the one-sided version of events set forth in the complaint written by the ACLU,"" according to a district statement. According to the complaint, R.S. felt that one of the school's adult hall monitors was picking on her, so she wrote on her Facebook ""wall"" that she hated that person because she was mean. The message was not posted from school property or using any school equipment or connections, the lawsuit states. Somehow, the school principal got a hold of a screenshot of the message, and punished R.S. with detention and made her apologize to the hall monitor, the complaint says. She was in trouble again shortly thereafter for another Facebook post, which asked who turned her in, using an expletive for effect, the lawsuit says. She was given in school suspension and missed a class ski trip. In the third incident, according to the complaint, R.S. was called in by school officials after the guardian of another student complained that R.S. had had a conversation about sex on Facebook. The girl was called to a meeting with a deputy sheriff, school counselor and an unidentified school employee, the court documents states. There, she was ""intimidated"" into giving up her login and passwords to her Facebook and e-mail accounts, the lawsuit says. ""R.S. was extremely nervous and being called out of class and being interrogated,"" the lawsuit says. The officials did not have permission from R.S.'s mother to view her private communications, and they gave the girl a hard time about some of the material they discovered, the lawsuit states. ""Students do not shed their First Amendment rights at the school house gate,"" Charles Samuelson, executive director for the ACLU in Minnesota, said in a statement. ""The Supreme Court ruled on that in the 1970s, yet schools like Minnewaska seem to have no regard for the standard."" The school district maintains that such searches did not cross any boundaries. ""The district is confident that once all facts come to light, the district's conduct will be found to be reasonable and appropriate,"" the district said.","A Minnesota school is accused of humiliating a young girl .

"(CNN) -- A surveillance video captured a masked gunman on a rampage in broad daylight on an Oakland, California, street that includes the point-blank execution of a teenage boy cowering on a sidewalk, CNN affiliate KTVU said. Police are now searching for the gunman who opened fire Sunday on pedestrians, sending them running for their lives into a busy street. One man is struck by a trailer, and his shoe flies into the air, the affiliate said. The surveillance video shows the teenager putting his hands in the air, but the gunman fires several more shots into the boy point-blank, KTVU said. CNN has not seen the video in its entirety. In addition to the teen, who was killed, two others were injured, according to Officer Kevin McDonald with the Oakland Police Department. He identified the deceased as 17-year-old David Manson Jr., 17. The conditions of the other two victims were not immediately known. ""What do we tell our kids now? You can't grow up to be 17?""

"(CNN) -- Facebook announced a major overhaul to its privacy controls Wednesday, adding a handful of features while simplifying and clarifying the ways users can already tweak their accounts. The changes, which will roll out over the next few weeks, include a new tool that lets users ask for photos of them to be removed from the site. Also being upgraded is a tool that lets users see what other people can -- and can't -- see on their Facebook pages. In addition, users will get more control over the apps they enable on the site by gaining the ability to grant permission for some access requests but deny others. Facebook says the changes are designed to help users better control, and understand, the information they're sharing on a site with roughly 1 billion accounts. ""We deeply believe that surprises are bad,"" said Sam Lessin, Facebook's director of product development. ""When users are surprised, no one wins."" During its rise from dorm-room project to the world's largest social network, Facebook's most persistent complaints from users have centered on privacy. Online privacy advocates and even elected officials have objected on occasion to how Facebook handles user data. The company has consistently argued that appropriate privacy tools are in place, although Lessin acknowledged they haven't always been clear or easy to find. ""It was pretty subtle, and we believe it wasn't clear enough to users,"" he said. Here's a look at some of the updates, which Lessin compared to some of the site's biggest changes in its eight-year history: . A ""Request and Removal"" tool for photos . Facebook users could already click to ask other users to remove tags of them on photos. But the new tool lets them request that photos be removed from the site entirely, and it gives the recipient the ability to do so with a single click. It also gives users the ability to select a reason for the request without having to begin a potentially embarrassing conversation themselves. ""If you don't want something on Facebook, it shouldn't be on Facebook,"" Lessin said. ""We need to give you the tools to address that in a straightforward way."" More specific app permissions . Currently, approving an app on Facebook requires agreeing to a sometimes intimidating list of permissions for the app to do things like access your Friends list and post on your Timeline. New changes, which will roll out first on Apple's iOS mobile platform, let users give an app basic permissions to start with and then approve other, specific access requests when the app needs them. Not all apps will move to the new model, however. Perhaps most significantly, games won't change. Privacy shortcuts . A frequent complaint among privacy advocates has been that the controls that exist on Facebook are hard for the average user to find and understand. ""[T]he privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati,"" danah boyd, a social-media researcher and privacy advocate, wrote for CNN during a 2010 privacy update. ""People should be able to understand Facebook's changes and have choices available that allow them to make appropriate decisions."" Under the new changes, there will be a privacy icon on Facebook's blue toolbar that takes users to the site's most used privacy tweaks (""Who can see my stuff?"" ""Who can contact me?"" ""How do I stop someone from bothering me?""). Help Center content for privacy will also be simplified, with tools that are currently divided between the site's Privacy and Security sections pulled together in one place. ""Obviously, security and privacy are deeply tied together,"" Lessin said. ""We knew that they were related, and we wanted to call that out."" Expanded Activity Log . The Activity Log, rolled out last year, lets users manage the information that appears on their Timeline. The updated version includes new navigation tools and will let users more easily see photos, status updates or other posts that may have been removed from Timeline but still appear elsewhere on Facebook. It includes simplified tools to let users ""view as"" other people (a feature that already exists) to see whether they've hidden or displayed posts the way they wanted. Want to keep some Facebook activity hidden from your grandmother or your boss? This tool is for you. Lessin said new messages will begin appearing on users' pages, explaining the changes as well as more clearly outlining how existing privacy tools work. He said Facebook will also be killing a little-used ""Who can look up my Timeline by name?"" tool, saying new features will make doing so easier.","Facebook announces a major privacy-control update .
Users will get a tool that asks for photos to be removed from site .
Privacy tools will be accessible from the top of every page .
Changes will start rolling out to users over next few weeks ."
"(CNN) -- You may already know that President Barack Obama's ""Four more years"" was the top post on Twitter in 2012. But what was yours? As part of its annual year-end roundup, the micro-blogging site is for the first time letting users look back to see their own activity, from their most-shared tweet to their most-used words and even their ""Golden Follower."" The tool ""My Year on Twitter,"" created by social data aggregators Vizify, collects tweets since January to rank users' activity. ""Every day, we're amazed and humbled by the many ways in which people use Twitter, which range from simply retweeting to igniting conversations with hashtags (even around lesser-known topics) to sharing spectacular and far-flung views,"" Twitter editorial director Karen Wickre wrote in a blog post. In addition to letting users see their most shared tweet and the follower who has interacted with them the most, the feature shows the 10 words users employed most often. It also lets users scroll through a timeline of their 2012 tweets. The feature is a personal twist on what's become a yearly tradition for Twitter: rounding up the most high-profile uses of the site. Obama's post-election tweet, featuring a photo of him and first lady Michelle Obama hugging, was retweeted more than 810,000 times and ""favorited"" more than 300,000. It became the most retweeted post in the site's history. Other top tweets included teen pop idol Justin Bieber's tribute to a 6-year-old fan who died of brain cancer and a profane screed by Green Bay Packers offensive lineman T.J. Lang after a controversial call by one of the NFL's replacement referees helped lead to a loss for his team. The site's most popular hashtag was #nowplaying, used to talk about music, with #oomf (short for ""one of my followers"") coming in second. #NFL was the top sports term, ""Family Guy"" topped the TV list and rapper Rick Ross was No. 1 among music tweets. (Shockingly, Twitter darling Bieber didn't make the Top 10.) The site also listed some of the most influential people who joined the site in 2012, from actress Betty White to rocker Neil Young to soccer legend Pele and Pope Benedict XVI.","New Twitter tool lets users see their top tweets, interactions of 2012 .

"Williamson, West Virginia (CNN) -- As she grieves, Rosie Crum is being called upon to lead. Rather than having dinner with her husband, Walter E. ""Eugene"" Crum, she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia. The county's three commissioners voted unanimously to appoint Rosie Crum as sheriff during an emotional meeting Thursday afternoon. That night, she was sworn in as sheriff at the county courthouse, meaning that she'll serve at least through the remainder of her late husband's term, with an election set for 2014. Rosie Crum did not speak at the ceremony, though she did hug 22 deputies who came to the ceremony, county commissioner John Mark Hubbard said. ""(She) is the best person to fulfill"" her husband's commitment as sheriff, including taking steps to curb drug abuse in the county, county Commissioner Greg ""Hootie"" Smith said. David Baisden, another county commissioner, explained that part of the rationale for appointing Rosie Crum -- who has known her husband since she was 14 and, though she is active in local politics, has no law enforcement experience -- is to make sure she is taken care of financially for the next 21 or so months. She will have a role, but Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel will ""manage the law enforcement end"" of the sheriff's department, he explained. Authorities still are trying to make sense how they got into this position, how a man so admired in his community could be so brazenly gunned down while eating his lunch. It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday, as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse. A man had walked up to the sheriff's driver's-side door from behind, fired at Crum's head, then returned to his own vehicle and drove away, Rockel told reporters Thursday. The .40-caliber shell casings recovered at the scene indicate the shots came from a semi-automatic handgun, he added. Those were some of the details offered Thursday by authorities. What they didn't explain, however, was why. The suspect -- Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37 -- was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Cabell Huntington Hospital, said Rockel. He had been shot in the chest an exchange of gunfire with a sheriff's deputy, following a chase. He ""said some things to us"" on his way to the hospital, West Virginia State Police First Sgt. Michael Baylous told CNN on Wednesday. ""We're still trying to make sense of it,"" Baylous said of Maynard's comments. ""It could be interpreted in different ways."" Rockel did not elaborate Thursday, when asked by CNN, on whatever Maynard might have said, saying only that ""we don't want to focus on any particular motive."" ""We are unsure at this point,"" Rockel said, why the sheriff was killed. ""We are looking at all possibilities."" Source: Suspect got treated for mental health issues . Who is Tennis Melvin Maynard? A search of Mingo County court records show no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard. His only citation involves failure to wear a seat belt, according to the records. On Thursday, a source with knowledge of the suspect's past told CNN that Maynard had spent time at a state hospital for mental health issues within the past couple of years. Weeping and shaking, his mother, Olgie Maynard, confirmed as much, saying her son was institutionalized for about a week three to four years ago. ""He went crazy,"" Olgie Maynard told CNN, explaining her son hadn't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama. ""He was out in the yard yelling. We called the police, and they took him away."" Since then, she said Tennis had gotten more psychiatric help at another mental health center. At home in Ragland, where he lives with his parents, he mostly stayed in his bedroom and watched television. ""He talks a lot to himself,"" Olgie Maynard said. ""... He was never violent."" She added that Tennis Maynard ""has guns, but I don't know one from another."" On Thursday afternoon, he was recovering in a hospital bed. According to the state police spokesman, Maynard is expected to survive. He's already facing at least two serious charges: first-degree murder for Crum's death and attempted murder for firing on a sheriff's deputy. ""Those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital,"" Rockel said. Sheriff's slaying 'a big blow to the community' The man he allegedly killed, 59-year-old Eugene Crum, had been a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor's office before becoming sheriff in January. In 93 days on the job, Crum gained a reputation for taking a tough stance on drug dealers. His legacy will live on, Mingo County officials say. ""The flame that Sheriff Crum sparked cannot be extinguished,"" Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney C. Michael Sparks said in a statement read at Thursday's press conference in Williamson. His slaying has shaken the rural county, which normally sees only one or two slayings per year, said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff's Office. ""It's devastating,"" Hatfield said. ""It's a big blow to the community."" Asked whether officials thought there was any connection between Crum's slaying and the recent killing of a Colorado prison official or the slayings of two Texas prosecutors, Hatfield said, ""I hope not,"" but declined to elaborate. For now, the focus is on remembering Crum and his family. In addition to Thursday night's candlelight vigil, a memorial service for Crum will be held late Saturday afternoon and his funeral will take place Sunday, both services at Mingo Central High School. Crum will be remembered as a devoted public servant and a family man, having left behind his wife as well as several children and grandchildren. ""It's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time,"" said Hubbard, president of the Mingo County commission. ""We continue to solicit your prayers.""

"Berlin (CNN) -- What appeared to be a human hand and foot were sent separately to two area schools, Vancouver police said Tuesday. The first package, containing what was thought to be a hand, was delivered to False Creek Elementary School, while the second, containing what appeared to be a foot, was found by staff at St. George's School, they said. It was not immediately clear whether the gruesome discoveries are connected to the case of Luka Rocco Magnotta, the Canadian porn actor accused of killing and dismembering a man and mailing body parts to politicians. ""The investigation is only a few hours old now, so I can't link it to anything,"" Vancouver Police Deputy Chief Warren Lemcke told reporters. Magnotta will not fight extradition after his arrest in Germany, a Berlin police official said Tuesday. The 29-year-old told a Berlin magistrate that he will return voluntarily to face charges in the death of university student Jun Lin, Chief Supt. Stefan Redlich of the Berlin police said. Magnotta faces first-degree murder and other charges in last month's killing of Lin, a 33-year-old Concordia University student from China. Authorities accuse Magnotta of dismembering Lin and mailing one of his hands and one of his feet to Canadian politicians. Lin's head and other hand and foot are still missing, Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere, a Montreal police spokesman, said Tuesday. Police also believe Magnotta filmed the death and dismemberment and posted it to the Internet. Authorities have said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts. On Tuesday, Lafreniere told reporters the video also included evidence of cannibalism. Berlin police arrested Magnotta on Monday at an Internet cafe where he was browsing articles about himself. The arrest ended an international manhunt that began when the body parts were found in the mail. Montreal police see no hurry in getting Magnotta back to Canada, Lafreniere said. ""At the moment, it is not a rush for us,"" he said. ""On our side, believe me, we've still got an investigation to do."" Police will investigate allegations of animal abuse made by online animal rights activists who accused him of killing kittens, and also look into possible links to other crimes, Lafreniere said. ""We're in contact with different agencies, it's a fact,"" he said. However, Lafreniere said investigators currently have no evidence linking him to other crimes. He also said investigators would check out rumored links between Magnotta and a well-known Canadian. While Lafreniere did not name that person, several Canadian newspapers have reported on rumors that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka. Ontario police arrested Homolka and her husband in 1993 in the rapes and murders of three Ontario girls, including her own sister. As part of a plea bargain, Homolka served 12 years in prison. CNN affiliate Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said Montreal police also were investigating a website that hosted the video. The site could face criminal charges for publishing obscene material, CBC reported, citing Lafreniere. The Magnotta case began last week when a caller complaining of a strong smell coming from an alley behind Magnotta's Montreal apartment building summoned police, Lafreniere said. Investigators found a torso stuffed inside a suitcase, he said. That same day, officials at Canada's Conservative Party headquarters received a package addressed to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that contained a foot. Officials later intercepted a package addressed to the Liberal Party that contained a hand. DNA tests completed Tuesday showed both were Lin's, according to Lafreniere. He said police don't believe Lin's missing body parts are in the country's mail system, but they are working with postal officials to make sure. In addition to the video posted to the Internet, Lafreniere said investigators have reviewed surveillance video from Magnotta's apartment building showing him carrying numerous bags downstairs. Investigators believe Magnotta killed Lin on May 24 or May 25, posted the video, then took a flight to France on May 26. He boarded a bus to Berlin on the morning of June 1, Lafreniere said. Magnotta describes himself as 'a people person' In the end, it was the keen eye of an employee at the Internet cafe in Berlin that helped police nab Magnotta. The employee, Kadir Anlayisli, said he recognized the slight man who walked into the nondescript Helin Spatkauf Internet Cafe on Monday, but he couldn't quite figure out why he did. But as Magnotta surfed the Web, poring over news accounts of the case in which he himself was the suspect, the realization dawned on Anlayisli. ""I looked in the papers and said, 'That's him who they're looking for, the porno killer,' "" Anlayisli told reporters. He flagged down a carload of German police trainees. Magnotta initially denied his identity, police said. Then he gave up without a fight, stating simply, ""OK, you got me.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The United States' plans to beef up its missile defenses against North Korea are likely to inflame tensions that are running high over Pyongyang's nuclear program, China said Monday. ""Bolstering missile defenses will only intensify antagonism, and it doesn't help to solve the issue,"" Hong Lei, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular news briefing in Beijing. The United States will deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack by North Korea, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Friday. The U.S. announcement came after North Korea recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on South Korea and the United States in response to stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month. Under threat, South Koreans mull nuclear weapons . The threat from the regime of young leader Kim Jong Un was part of a recent barrage of vitriolic statements, which included a vow to nullify the armistice agreement that stopped the Korean War in 1953. Military and White House officials have said current U.S. missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat, and President Barack Obama said in an interview with ABC News last week that he didn't think North Korea could carry out a missile attack on the United States. ""They probably can't, but we don't like the margin of error,"" Obama said. The 14 additional interceptors, to be installed by 2017, would bring the total to 44, according to the Pentagon. ""The reason that we are doing what we are doing and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security is to not take any chances, is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency,"" Hagel said. Concerns about regional stability . But Hong said Monday that China believes that the anti-missile issue ""matters to global strategic balance and regional stability. It also matters to strategic trust between relevant countries."" North Korea on Saturday responded to the U.S. announcement by criticizing what it described as the Americans' ""hostile policy"" and saying it won't negotiate with them over its nuclear program. Its nuclear weapons ""serve as an all-powerful treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty and security of the country,"" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. ""Therefore, they cannot be disputed ... as long as the U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy persist."" Tensions on the Korean Peninsula escalated in December, when North Korea successfully launched a long-range rocket, putting a satellite in space for the first time. The United States and other Western nations called the launch a test of ballistic missile technology, and the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang. North Korea responded angrily to the U.N. measures, vowing to carry out its third nuclear test. It made good on its promise last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to expand sanctions further, which in turn set off the latest flurry of fiery North Korean rhetoric.

"(CNN) -- Park rangers suspended their search Monday afternoon for a teenage swimmer who was swept over a nearly 600-foot waterfall in California's Yosemite National Park over the weekend. Aleh Kalman had been swimming about 150 feet from the edge of the Nevada Fall on Saturday afternoon when he was caught up in the swift current of the Merced River, the National Park Service reported. The 19-year-old Sacramento resident had gone to the park with a church group, the park service said. ""We believe it's impossible to survive a fall like that,"" park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said. Swimming above the 594-foot Nevada Fall is not illegal, but the river is marked by signs warning of the danger, Cobb said. Water levels were too high to search safely Monday, Scott Gediman with the Yosemite National Park Service said. Officials also announced Monday that a 28-year-old English climber on El Capitan was killed by a falling rock on Sunday. Felix Kiernan of London was about 600 feet up a climbing route when a large rock fell 150 feet and hit him. When rangers reached him a few hours later, he was already dead. Searchers looked for Kalman on foot and by helicopter on Saturday but had to stop at nightfall. The grim task resumed Sunday, aided by three dog teams, the park service said.

"(CNN) -- Facebook and Google are battling it out to dominate your smartphone time and, for now, Facebook is winning. According to the latest stats from comScore, Facebook was the most popular mobile app in the United States in 2012. The Google Maps app held the top position until October, when Apple rolled out its latest mobile operating system, iOS 6, and replaced the built-in Google Maps app with its own, less accurate version. Of course, Facebook also had a hand in its own success. Its number of monthly unique visitors rose steadily over the course of the year. In August, the company rolled out a long overdue revamp of its iOS mobile app for iPhone and iPads, significantly speeding up the launch, scroll and browsing times. User reviews in Apple's App Store shot up as a result, and in December the company followed up with a better version of its Android app. Review: Facebook's Graph Search is promising but incomplete . Facebook started 2012 facing criticisms of its mobile strategy, and while there are still lingering questions about how it will make money off of mobile, these stats show its adept at transferring the Facebook experience to tablets and smartphones. People aren't just opening their Facebook app the most, they're spending astonishingly large chunks of time in the app, poking around and reading up on their friends. The social network's app was the single largest, single app time suck, accounting for 23% of the time people spend using mobile apps, according to comScore. Instagram was a distant second accounting for just 3% of the time people spend in apps. Google's app with the most engagement was Gmail, but in total 10% of users' time was spent across various Google apps. The more interesting story in the coming year might be Google's rise to dominate all mobile platforms, not just its own Android operating system. Facebook may have the No. 1 spot locked up, but Google apps account for the next five most popular apps. After Maps, Google Play, Google Search, Gmail and YouTube were the top apps on Android and iOS devices in December. Google only re-released an iOS version of its Maps app in December, which could continue to fight back and possibly overtake Facebook in 2013. Apple's only app on the list is iTunes, coming in at 8th place. Rounding out the top 10 list are Pandora Radio, Cooliris and Yahoo! Messenger.

"(CNN) -- Formula One has returned to Bahrain amid conflicting views about the sport's place in a country where political tensions are running high. The head of the sport's governing body the FIA, Jean Todt, insists the sport coming to Bahrain can be a force for good. But that view is not shared by anti-government protesters, who recently staged a drum march in the village outside Bahrain's capital Manama to urge F1 not to come under the current circumstances. Many issues in the kingdom remain unresolved after an uprising in 2011 where the majority Shiite population demanded more rights from the rulers who belong to the minority Sunni sect. Those protests were violently crushed by Bahrain's security forces with troops from Saudi Arabia coming in to support the government. In the aftermath of the protests the government promised reform including a special unit set up to investigate claims of rights abuses but critics say little has changed, so the opposition continues to do battle. The former team principal of F1's famous Ferrari marque, Todt is not attending the Bahrain Grand Prix, though officials have played down the significance of his absence, with a spokesman reportedly sayng the event was never on his schedule. Todt recently drew criticism, accused of failing to voice his views on why F1 is continuing to race in the volatile Gulf Kingdom. In 2011 the race was canceled because of ongoing civil unrest but was reinstated last season. The FIA president went some way to addressing that criticism this week by sending a letter to an umbrella group of human rights activists in Bahrain. In the letter, seen by news agency Reuters, Todt explained: ""Sport, and the F1 Grand Prix, can have a positive and healing effect in situation where conflict, social unrest and tensions are causing distress."" Protesters view the Bahrain GP as a rare opportunity to raise awareness of the country's political situation for a global audience. ""The media doesn't cover the demonstrations like this revolution which is part of the Arab Spring,"" Sayed Yousif Al-Mahfdah from the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, told CNN. ""This is why we tell them come over to the Formula One race and come see the women and the men marching in the streets demanding democracy and human rights."" Bahrain maintains that has worked to resolve political differences, and the government argues the race will bring benefits to many Bahrainis. ""F1 brings significant benefits to everyone in Bahrain, especially economically,"" the government said in a statement. ""Bahrain upholds the right to peaceful protest. It is a country made up of many communities with different views on its development. ""This is why it has launched a dialogue between all political groups to address political issues in a manner that will ensure the country develops in a sustainable way. ""It should be noted that in some cases protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence. ""Only in these case do security forces respond and they do so while exercising appropriate restraint. Some unfortunately believe that continued unrest on the streets affords them a political advantage, when it results in greater divisions between communities in Bahrain. Violence can never be tolerated."" However, a number of leading human rights organizations argue the sport provides credibility to a government accused of human rights abuses. Read more: Is Bahrain serious about reform? ""Many people in Bahrain no longer see Formula One as a sport, but as an organization which supports a repressive regime,"" said a protest group comprised of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, the Bahrain Press Association, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and the Campaign Against Arms Trade. This week a group British MPs wrote letter to F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone urging him to call off the grand prix. Ecclestone has voiced sympathy for the protesters but the race is still scheduled to go ahead. When F1 returned to Bahrain in 2012, the race weekend was undisturbed although two members of the Force India team returned to the UK after being caught up in petrol bomb attacks on their journey from the Sakhir circuit.","Formula One returns to Bahrain amid anti-government protests .

"(CNN) -- Two very different images captivated Internet viewers on Wednesday. First, a YouTube video of an eagle snatching up a toddler captivated millions of viewers, some of whom may not have immediately realized it was fake. Uploaded on Tuesday, the clip shows a golden eagle swooping out of the sky to grab an infant in its talons, then dropping the child seconds later. Despite broad and immediate skepticism of its authenticity, it had more than 5 million views by Wednesday evening. The Canadian digital-media school where the video was created issued a statement Wednesday afternoon clarifying the clip as a hoax and naming the students involved. However the school, Centre NAD, was unapologetic about its prank, even pointing viewers to another hoax video, created by students, of an unlikely penguin escape. (The penguin video had a paltry 37,000 views.) Comments on YouTube and the school's website were mixed. Sandra Bauer wrote, ""... it would be a good idea to post some links to raptor rescue centres. This video will undoubtedly spawn irrational fear of eagles and others."" A YouTube commenter, DJ Mykee, had a more light-hearted view: ""KIDNAPPING CHILDREN ISï»¿ ILL-EAGLE."" Considering that the bald eagle is a national symbol of U.S., maybe it's fitting that the day's other viral imagery involved President Barack Obama. Time's website published a behind-the-scenes gallery of photos of Obama, snapped by White House photographer Pete Souza, to accompany the magazine naming Obama its Person of the Year. One of them showed Obama at the White House, pretending to be caught in a pint-sized Spider-Man's web. Although Time's choice of Obama over Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai was controversial to some, Twitter was immediately captivated by the Spider-Man image. Obama posted the photo Wednesday morning on his Twitter account, and by the evening it had been retweeted more than 9,200 times. @michael_lobster tweeted, ""I really hope that this is the plot of the new Spider-Man movie."" The tone on Facebook was decidedly less enthusiastic. ""Am I the only one who is skeptical of all these cute kid picture situations the President seems to find himself in? Authentic or staged?"" wrote Sunny Blankinship. ""I don't know about politics, but I can tell you one thing,"" wrote Kaldrenon on the social platform Reddit. ""I want to be the kind of father Obama is, and treat all kids this well."" ""The photo,"" wrote Gawker, ""does a better job of cementing the correctness of Time's selection than any 10,000-word profile can.""

"(CNN) -- Newspapers across Europe Wednesday reprinted the controversial cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed that sparked worldwide protests two years ago. The move came one day after Danish authorities arrested three people allegedly plotting a ""terror-related assassination"" of Kurt Westergaard, the cartoonist behind the drawing. Berlingske Tidende, was one of the newspapers involved in the republication by newspapers in Denmark. It said: ""We are doing this to document what is at stake in this case, and to unambiguously back and support the freedom of speech that we as a newspaper always will defend,"" in comments reported by The Associated Press. Newspapers in Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands also republished the drawing Wednesday as part of their coverage of Tuesday's arrests. The image, by Morgenavisen Jullands-Posten cartoonist Westergaard, was one of  12 cartoons about the Prophet Mohammed originally published in September 2005. Westergaard's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse. Violent demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech. The uproar came as some Muslims believe it is forbidden by the Quran to show an image of the prophet. Many protesters directed their ire at Denmark, prompting the closure of several Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan. There were also attacks on other diplomatic missions in Iran and Syria among others. The Danish Foreign Ministry has said it is keeping a watch on the situation at its embassies and has yet to report any incidents. Muslim leaders in Denmark Wednesday attacked the republication of the cartoon, as well as the alleged murder plot, while calling for calm. Imam Mostafa Chendid, chief of the Islamic Faith Community, told AP his group was discussing whether to hold a demonstration before parliament, adding: ""We are so unhappy about the cartoon being reprinted."" ""No blood was ever shed in Denmark because of this, and no blood will be shed. We are trying to calm down people, but let's see what happens. Let's open a dialogue."" The Danish Security and Intelligence Service Tuesday said police arrested a 40-year-old Dane of Moroccan origin and two Tunisians in the Aarhus area of western Denmark following lengthy surveillance.  The Danish citizen is charged with a terrorism offense, the intelligence service said, and the Tunisians will be deported. Police have not yet released the names of the three. The target of the plot, the intelligence service said, was the cartoonist for the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jullands-Posten, which first published the controversial drawings in September 2005. The paper identified the cartoonist as Kurt Westergaard.  Watch how threats have targeted cartoonists » . ""Not wanting to take any undue risks [the intelligence service] has decided to intervene at a very early stage in order to interrupt the planning and the actual assassination,"" the statement by Jakob Scharf, the agency's director general, said. ""Thus, this morning's operation must first and foremost be seen as a preventive measure where the aim has been to stop a crime from being committed."" Westergaard has previously said that he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. ""Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me,"" Westergaard said in a statement posted on the newspaper's Web site. ""However, I have turned fear into anger and indignation. It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness."" CNN's Paula Newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in Europe that radical Islam was trying to suppress free speech. ""More and more Europeans feel that Islam is a threat to their way of life,"" Newton said. A recent Gallup poll for the World Economic Forum showed a majority of Europeans believed relations between the West and the Muslim world were worsening. According to the poll this sentiment was strongest held among Danish. Westergaard remains under police protection and does not know whether it will continue. ""I could not possibly know for how long I have to live under police protection; I think, however, that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life,"" he said. ""It is sad indeed, but it has become a fact of my life."" Carsten Juste, the paper's editor-in-chief, said staffers have been ""deeply worried"" for several months. ""The arrests have hopefully thwarted the murder plans,"" he said on the newspaper's Web site. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report . Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(CNN) -- In her new, already much-discussed book, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg argues we need to ""lean in"" more to our careers. We need to ask for flexibility even when the thought of doing so scares us, say yes to the promotions and the big projects, and radiate our own worthiness at cocktail parties just like the Harvard boys. Agreed. But to prevent falling flat on our faces from all that forward momentum, we also need to learn to ""lean out"" in other areas of our lives. Too many women might let their employers off the hook, shying away from salary negotiation or accepting policies that prevent working mothers from thriving, but more still never let themselves off the hook. Opinion: Why women must seize this moment . It's time that women wave the white flag of surrender over our own messy, beautiful lives. We must accept imperfection -- physical, domestic, social -- and strive, instead, to be whole, bold, interesting. We must embrace psychologist D.W. Winnicott's decades-old idea of the ""good enough mother."" At the TED conference last week, surrounded by uberachievers, I was chatting with a superstar organizational leader in the hallways, and she told me that it was her 4-year-old daughter's birthday. ""It must be hard not to be with her. It's such a special day!"" I said. ""Not really,"" she immediately responded. ""We all turned 4 -- it's not that special. There will be plenty more birthdays, and she's having a great day with her dad."" Photos: The historical analogs of brilliant women . I was stunned. Regardless of what you think about her nonchalance, you have to admire this woman's capacity to shed the preciousness of motherhood so publicly. In this little exchange, she was boldly ""leaning out"" of the gender-based expectation that she would be tortured about missing her daughter's birthday. Instead, she owned that she, in fact, was excited to be at a conference that promised to boost her own career. The bonus: Her husband had an opportunity to strengthen his bond and build more memories with his daughter. Another recent, and rare, sighting of a woman ""leaning out"": A couple of weeks ago, I was sitting around a coffee table, eating Thai takeout with a circle of women in their 20s and 30s. Another high-achieving friend showed us a photo of her young son, sitting on a hospital bed, smiling enthusiastically while holding out a big thumbs up. Turns out that while she was away on a business trip, he'd fallen out of a tree and had to go to the hospital. The bowl-haired little boy had asked his father to snap this photo with his iPhone to send to his mom so she could see how brave he had been, even and especially without her. The myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career . Instead of ""leaning in"" to guilt that she hadn't been there to supervise his stitches, she ""leaned out"" with a proud smile; her son was already learning the power of resilience. So yes, part of the revolution is asking for what we're worth at work, but part of it is also not overestimating our worth at home. We must give ourselves permission to be less responsible in the parts of our life that women have micromanaged for decades -- the dishes, the carpool and even the thank-you notes. Too often, we want our friends, our family, our employers to all consider us infallible and ""good,"" what author Rachel Simmons calls the ""curse of the good girl."" Work and family: How do you and your partner make it work? Instead, we need to sharpen our serenity, cut through the guilt and the expectations and the perfection and accept when we just can't live up to our own or others' expectations of perfection. We need to practice big, radical shrugs: the all-too-rare and oh-so-powerful, ""Oh well,"" of a woman who has accepted that she couldn't be everywhere at once or be everything to everybody. My own mom is a seriously talented, dynamic woman, but cooking is not one of her favorite things. Even so, she spent almost every night of my childhood cooking up homemade meatloaf, slow cookers full of oxtail soup, chicken casseroles and other Midwestern specialties just like her own mother had done, just like she thought she had to. Sadly, and to my mom's palpable frustration, I don't remember any of these meals. Instead, I remember my mom screening documentary films, jumping on the trampoline, going on power walks in the park with her friends. These are the things she loved. These are the things that shaped who I am. While Sheryl Sandberg has become the new icon of ""leaning in,"" we need a wide variety of women -- diverse in their ethnic, economic and geographical distribution -- who embody a new era of ""leaning out,"" too.

The rapper has been featured on ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" only a few times since being in a relationship with Kim. West confirms he takes his romance seriously, and is not looking for more publicity. ""Oh, that's just all for love. It's simply that,"" he told W magazine. ""At a certain point, or always, love is more important than any branding, or any set of cool people, or attempting to impress anyone. Because true love is just the way you feel. Thoughts and feelings can disagree sometimes."" The rapper has advised the mother of his newborn daughter, North West, on many of her outfits since they became a couple, and some of those style choices have been publicly criticized. ""For her to take that risk in front of the world, it just shows you how much she loves me,"" he explained. ""And how much she actually loves the opportunity to learn. ... You got, like, a million companies saying, 'This is impacting your brand! This is impacting your fans! And blah blah blah.' But she still sees this light of beauty."" As for West reportedly controlling her look since they started dating, he explained that's not possible. ""Nobody can tell my girl what to do,"" he commented. ""She just needed to be given some platforms of information to work from. .. One beautiful thing is that as she discovers it, the world discovers it."" The couple welcomed their first child together, daughter North, on June 15. Courtesy of Cover Media .","Kanye West opens up about his romance with Kim Kardashian in W magazine .

"(CNN) -- Warner Bros. scored a huge victory in the long-running and byzantine legal battle over the copyright to Superman yesterday, thanks to a ruling by 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that cements the studio's control over the lucrative superhero character. The decision drew, in part, on precedent established in a lawsuit against Facebook by the Winklevoss twins and held that a 2001 agreement between the heirs of Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel and Warner Bros was indeed binding and that a district judge in a 2008 case had ""erred"" in granting the Siegel heirs partial copyright. This decision follows a ruling last October that denied any part of the copyright to the heirs of Superman's other co-creator, Joe Shuster. Shuster and Siegel famously sold their creation to DC Comics for a mere $130 in 1938, long before the character went on to become a multi-billion dollar franchise for the studio, thanks to the success of numerous Hollywood blockbusters, television shows and other merchandise. The recent ruling on the fate of Superman hinged upon a 2001 agreement between the Siegel heirs and Warner Bros, which the Siegels had claimed was not finalized and therefore not enforceable. In their decision on the case, the 9th Circuit repeatedly cited a lawsuit involving Facebook as precedent, wherein the Winklevoss brothers â€” who sued the social media site for allegedly stealing their idea -- had similarly claimed that an earlier mediated agreement was non-binding. The court disagreed, and found that under California law, a ""term sheet"" agreement could be enforceable ""even though everyone understood that certain material aspects of the deal would be papered later."" Jeff Trexler, an attorney and law professor who previously served as a clerk in the 9th Circuit, told Wired that while ""it's entirely possible that the court would have reached the same outcome without the Facebook ruling... Facebook made it practically inevitable."" Wired reached out for comment to Warner Bros, who responded: . ""This is a great day for Superman, for his fans, for DC Entertainment and for Warner Bros. Today's ruling vindicates DC Comics' long-held position that it entered into a binding agreement with the Jerry Siegel family in 2001.The Court's decision paves the way for the Siegels finally to receive the compensation they negotiated for and which DC has been prepared to pay for over a decade. We are extremely pleased that Superman's adventures can continue to be enjoyed across all media platforms worldwide for generations to come."" The decision comes at a fortunate time for the studio, whose new Superman reboot ""Man of Steel"" heads to theaters in June. Before the latest ruling, Warner Bros. would have been unable to create new ""derivative works"" based on Superman's first appearance in Action Comics #1 â€” presumably including Superman films â€” without accounting for the profits to the Siegels as co-owners, complicating plans for a potential Man of Steel sequel and the Justice League movie slated for 2015. Now, Warner Bros. will likely be able to proceed without further hindrance, ending a nearly 65-year legal battle whose uglier moments included a letter from Siegel's dying widow (the original model for Lois Lane) accusing the Warner Bros. lawyers of harassment and a still-ongoing lawsuit by Warner Bros. accusing the Siegel's lawyer Marc Toberoff of misconduct. In 2011, Jerry Siegel's daughter Laura Siegel Larson published a letter likening her family's legal battle with Warner Bros. to a ""David versus Goliath struggle"" and said that her father had ""co-created Superman as the 'champion of the oppressed ... sworn to devote his existence to helping those in need!' But sadly his dying wish, for his family to regain his rightful share of Superman, has become a cautionary tale for writers and artists everywhere.""

"(CNN) -- A surfer died Tuesday after a shark bit him off the coast of a Southern California air force base, authorities said. Francisco Javier Solorio Jr., 39, was riding waves Tuesday morning with three friends when he was bitten, according to Santa Barbara Sheriff's Office. One of the friends saw the attack, swam over and pulled Solorio out of the water and onto the beach, Sgt. Mark Williams with the sheriff's office said. The friend gave him first aid while another called for help, he said. Paramedics pronounced Solorio dead at the scene, the sheriff's office said. The four friends were surfing at Surf Beach, located on the Vandenberg Air Force Base, whose fire department responded to the emergency call, authorities said. Solorio, who was from Orcutt, just two miles from Vandenberg, wasn't affiliated with the military base, said a Vandenberg spokeswoman. Authorities say the surf board showed bite marks, the military base said. The type of shark hadn't been identified as of Tuesday afternoon, and that base beach was closed until further notice, authorities said. On October 22, 2010 -- a day short of a two-year anniversary -- another shark attack killed a 19-year-old college student off the same beach at Vandenberg. That shark, described as being 14 to 20 feet, bit off the left leg of Lucas McKaine Ransom of Romoland, California, while he was Boogie Boarding with a 20-year-old male friend, authorities said. Ransom was a junior at University of California at Santa Barbara and was majoring in chemical engineering. Surf Beach is one of three that sit on the coastal military base and is the only one open to the public, a military spokesman said Tuesday.

"(Cover Media) -- Alyssa Milano doesn't think every child actor is bound to get in trouble with the law. The 40-year-old actress appeared on screens as a preteen in the 1980s sitcom ""Who's The Boss,"" and thinks her genuine gift of being an actress has kept her from going off the rails. ""I hope it's talent,"" she told Maxim magazine. ""That was an era when TV child actors just didn't work after their show was over."" The ""Mistresses"" star believes that only certain people have been able to hold on to regular jobs while maintaining their wholesome image. She counts ""Married With Children's"" Christina Applegate, 41, as another actress who has done well out of starting work early in life. ""I think Christina Applegate and I are the only two who maintained some sort of career path past the shows that launched us,"" she confessed. Milano welcomed her first child with her CAA agent husband David Bugliari in 2011. She thinks that troubled stars like Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Bynes didn't have much chance of have a healthy career and personal life to begin with. ""I have a great family, and I look at a lot of these kids who struggle in the industry and think they'd have struggled no matter what they did,"" she admitted.

"(CNN) -- In 1976, Jo Freeman published an essay in Ms. Magazine titled, ""Trashing: The Dark Side of Sisterhood,"" which described how groups of women within the feminist movement attacked and ostracized those seen as too visible or ambitious. ""To do something significant, to be recognized, to achieve, is to imply that one is 'making it off other women's oppression' or that one thinks oneself better than other women,"" she wrote. The piece struck a chord, receiving more letters in response than anything else the magazine had printed. As various over-the-top denunciations of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, the avowedly feminist author of ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead,"" suggest, it remains depressingly relevant decades later. Not all the critiques of ""Lean In"" have been unfair or unduly personal, but there has been enough viciousness directed toward Sandberg to indicate that a lot of women, some self-described feminists among them, still have a problem with female power. 'Having it all': 10 views . With trademark alliteration, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd called Sandberg a ""PowerPoint Pied Piper in Prada ankle boots."" A USA Today column accused her of waging a ""war on moms,"" and Melissa Gira Grant, writing in the Washington Post, went after her for relying on a staff ""to help keep house, raise her children and throw her women's leadership dinners."" Unconsciously echoing Freeman's essay, Grant wrote that there is ""simply no way for women to lean in without leaning on the backs of other women."" This was especially ironic because Grant, who writes frequently about sex work, often argues that it's wrong to assume that prostitutes are exploited, because that denies their agency. Apparently men who hire hookers aren't taking advantage of them, but women who hire nannies are. Why are women so much harder on other women than they are on men? Part of it seems to be because they expect so much more. The assumption that women should be altruistic and self-effacing pervades both mainstream society and some precincts of the feminist movement. It's OK if women advocate on behalf of the collective, but not if they champion themselves. As Freeman wrote, ""Among women there are two roles perceived as permissible: the 'helper' and the 'helped.'"" Opinion: Guilt poisons women . This creates difficulties for women from both above and below. As Sandberg writes in ""Lean In,"" women seeking raises and promotions can't simply use the same techniques as their male peers, because they'll be judged far more harshly; instead, she recommends that women smile a lot and speak in terms of ""we"" instead of ""I."" She doesn't dwell as much on how powerful women are regarded by those with less power, but the reception of her book has demonstrated that part of what's tricky about women's attempts to lead is getting others to follow. This isn't just about Sheryl Sandberg. Polls pretty consistently show that women and men prefer male bosses over female ones, although the margin has been narrowing. Interestingly, according to a 2011 Gallup Poll, those who have female bosses are more likely to say they'd rather work for a woman. The aversion to female leadership, then, comes from prejudice rather than negative experience with actual women, and can dissipate as more women attain positions of authority. Their quests for more authority, however, will continue to inspire disproportionate hostility. This doesn't mean that Sandberg or any other woman deserves support simply for her gender. It does mean they shouldn't be held to a higher standard than men. Balancing work and family: How do you make it work? Consider, for example, the very different way the activism of Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has been received. Hughes, like Sandberg, is extremely, even obscenely rich, and he and his husband have used part of their wealth to become major champions of same-sex marriage. Maybe someone somewhere has argued that their work for gay rights means little because it stems from self-interest, or that they shouldn't be focusing on a bourgeois issue like marriage that does little for, say, homeless gay teenagers. If such critics are out there, though, they're certainly not on the pages of our major newspapers. When women have the temerity to marshal power on their own behalf, the response is much more negative, and one can't always tell the difference between those who resent women and those who resent power. As Freeman wrote about ""trashing,"" it was often ""clothed in the rhetoric of revolution and feminism. But underneath are some very traditional ideas about women's proper roles.""

"(CNN) -- Vacationers at Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks this summer should make extra efforts to wash their hands, the National Park Service urged Wednesday, after noting a spike in sicknesses among visitors so far. In a news release, the park service noted ""greater than normal reports of gastrointestinal illness"" among those visiting the park in northwestern Wyoming as well as areas in Montana outside the two parks. That includes an incident June 7, when members of a tour group visiting Mammoth Hot Springs -- a part of Yellowstone that's located on the Montana/Wyoming border -- began complaining of stomach and other issues. Park employees who had been in contact with this group reported similar symptoms within 48 hours. Subsequent tests indicated that they were suffering from norovirus, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes is ""a very contagious virus that (can be contracted) from an infected person, contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces."" In addition to visitors, there have been more than 100 suspected cases of norovirus among Yellowstone employees and another 50 suspected cases among Grand Teton workers, the National Park Service said in a press release. The park service and businesses servicing visitors are taking special steps given the surge in illness, including more frequent cleaning and disinfection of public areas. As part of these measures, park employees showing signs of infection must be symptom-free for 72 hours before returning to work. News of the spate of norovirus cases spurred a wide range of comments on Yellowstone's Facebook page, including some offering appreciation for the update and others expressing concern to hear of the illness before their planned trip to the park. One woman said she was among the visitors who got sick around June 7, calling it ""the worst pain I have ever had."" ""I'm going this weekend and will be washing my hands like crazy, not to mention using disinfecting wipes after leaving public areas,"" another woman wrote. ""This sounds like a quick way to ruin a trip hope everyone is ok!"" This isn't the first time that illnesses have plagued national parks out west. Last summer, at least eight visitors to Yosemite National Park contracted hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Three of them died. Another Yosemite camper dies in hantavirus outbreak . Officials at that park, which receives about 4 million visitors a year, reached out to all people who stayed between mid-June and the end of August at the ""signature tent cabins"" that quickly became the epicenter of the investigation. Rare but serious, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has symptoms that mimic a cold or the flu and can be spread through contact with the urine, droppings or saliva of infected rodents, primarily deer mice. This year, national parks are saddled with another problem: $113 million in budget cuts tied to the federal government ""sequester."" But there's been no indication lower funding will have any impact on how officials from Yosemite and Grand Teton parks tackle the rise in norovirus cases.","NEW: Some commenters on Yellowstone's Facebook are concerned; others are thankful .

"(CNN) -- In an emotional open letter to the person responsible for her daughter's disappearance, the mother of missing Indiana University student Lauren Spierer pledges to never give up searching for answers. ""If you think for a minute her father and I are going to disappear, think again,"" Charlene Spierer writes in the letter, written on the three-month anniversary of Lauren Spierer's disappearance and released Saturday on the family's ""Find Lauren"" web site. ""We are just as determined today as we were day one. You should know that Lauren is precious to us. ... We are in this for the long haul. Do you think we are going to walk away without finding out the answers? Do you think we are going to rest until we find Lauren? We will not. You have no idea who you have taken from us. We will never give up."" Lauren Spierer, a 20-year-old sophomore, was last seen early June 3 after leaving a Bloomington, Indiana, sports bar with a male student. Surveillance camera footage from an alley between the two students' apartment buildings showed them walking toward the male student's building about 3 a.m. Spierer's keys were later found in the alley, but she has not been seen since. One of the male student's neighbors reported seeing Spierer leave about 4:30 a.m., but police have said they found no sign of her after the 3 a.m. sighting on any of the surveillance video from the area between the two buildings. Police have not named any suspects.. In her letter, Charlene Spierer details the heartache her family has experienced since the disappearance. ""Much has happened over the past three months,"" she wrote. ""I won't bore you with the details, if you've even gotten this far in reading this letter. I will say we have had the support and guidance of a multitude of people which has helped keep us going. For that generosity, we will be forever grateful."" She recalls being asked by a young relative, at a birthday celebration for her other daughter, Rebecca, whether the family would celebrate Lauren Spierer's birthday even if she was not there. ""I didn't really know what to say,"" she writes. ""Now I do. Of course we will celebrate Lauren's birthday."" She writes that as students returned to Indiana University for the fall semester, her family was packing her daughter's possessions and shipping them home. ""Nineteen boxes,"" she said. ""Can you imagine that so much promise would fit into 19 boxes? I won't go into the details of what it was like to pack Lauren's things. I will just tell you it was excruciating. Every moment was excruciating."" Charlene Spierer writes that she and her daughter share many things. ""Today I can add to that list,"" she says -- the day that marks three months since the disappearance is also Charlene Spierer's birthday. She recalls feeling ""physically sick"" upon learning her daughter was missing, calling hospitals in the hope that a Lauren Spierer or Jane Doe had been admitted. She immediately flew to Bloomington from New York, she writes, and her father drove her to the airport. ""Imagine a grandfather, driving his daughter to the airport on the way to discover what has happened to his granddaughter,"" she writes. ""Imagine that. There were few words exchanged. There are no words."" ""You are responsible for Lauren's disappearance,"" she writes. ""You know where she is. You are guilty of a heinous crime."" She closes by asking the person, ""What are you thinking? I would really like to know. I am waiting to hear from you."" At the end, she attaches a brief note to her daughter: ""Dearest Lauren, we are loving you. Missing you. Always, Mom."" Lauren Spierer was last seen wearing black pants and a white tank top with a white shirt, according to her family's web site. She is 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds and has blond hair and blue eyes. Police searched a landfill outside of Bloomington last month in connection with Spierer's disappearance. Nothing was found, according to CNN affiliate WISH. Attempts to reach the Spierer family Sunday were not immediately successful.","Lauren Spierer was last seen on June 3 .

"(CNN) -- It's a horrifying case that officials described as heinous and troubling. Three suspects were arrested Tuesday and accused of forced labor for allegedly holding a woman and her daughter captive for more than a year in Ashland, Ohio. A federal prosecutor described it as modern-day slavery. An FBI agent's affidavit filed in an Ohio federal court this week provided details about some of accusations that suspects Jordie Callahan, Jessica Hunt and Daniel Brown are facing. Attorneys for Hunt and Brown could not be immediately reached for comment. An attorney for Callahan told CNN affiliate WOIO that the accusations are ludicrous. And Callahan's mother told CNN that the accusations are false. Here are several excerpts from Special Agent Michael S. Sirohman's affidavit, which identifies the mother as ""S.E."" and calls her 6-year-old daughter ""juvenile victim:"" -- ""S.E. advised law enforcement that Hunt and Callahan made S.E. care for their iguanas and numerous pit bulls, clean the house, do laundry, do yard work, and walk to the store to do their shopping."" -- ""Brown advised law enforcement that he instructed S.E. to hit juvenile victim and that Callahan, Hunt and Brown then used their cell phones to record the screen of the baby monitor as they watched S.E. hit juvenile victim on the monitor."" -- ""S.E. recounted a time when she and juvenile victim had not eaten all day, and Callahan got a plate of food and gave it to the dog, rather than letting them eat."" -- ""Witness #4 advised law enforcement that he had seen Callahan point guns at S.E.'s head and say he [Callahan] would shoot S.E. Witness #4 said he was sure S.E. was terrified."" -- ""S.E. advised law enforcement that the door to that room was tied closed during the day to keep juvenile victim from getting into the family's food while S.E. cleaned. S.E. further advised that at night, the door to this room was padlocked to keep S.E. and juvenile victim from escaping. S.E. advised that Callahan and Hunt ordered them to look at the camera in their room and ask to be let out to use the bathroom."" -- ""Witness #3 advised law enforcement that he saw Hunt drag S.E. down the stairs from S.E.'s room by S.E.'s hair and Hunt held S.E.'s face down by a mess made by one of Hunt and Callahan's pit bulls. Witness #3 advised that Hunt was swearing at S.E. and telling S.E. to clean up the dog urine (and) feces."" -- ""S.E. told law enforcement that Callahan and Hunt would bind up juvenile victim with rope or tape to prevent juvenile victim from getting into Hunt and Callahan's food or getting something to drink. ... S.E. stated that on multiple occasions, she tried to remove the bindings from her daughter, but Hunt and Callahan were watching S.E. on the video monitor and one of Hunt's sons would come up to the room and tell S.E. to leave the juvenile victim bound."" -- ""Witness #5 told law enforcement that he had visited Hunt and Callahan's apartment on multiple occasions to buy drugs. Witness #5 advised law enforcement that Callahan's snake collection included a poisonous coral snake, a ball python, and a Burmese python that weighed approximately 130 pounds.

"(CNN) -- A 50-foot-wide, 15-ton magnet is about to set out on a 3,200-mile barge-and-truck tour down the East Coast of the United States, around Florida and up from the Gulf to Chicago before going to work to measure one of the smallest particles known to science. Currently at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York, the massive particle storage ring is scheduled to travel to another DOE facility at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago, where scientists hope it will help more accurately measure the properties of subatomic particles called muons. The tiny particles exist for only 2.2 millionths of a second, according to a press release from the Brookhaven lab. The massive magnet creates a magnetic field 30,000 times the Earth's magnetic field, but is so fragile that the coil it contains can't bend more than a tenth of an inch to maintain its current precision. The voyage, scheduled to begin on Saturday and end in July, will send the metal behemoth on a journey on trucks and barges. For safety, when it is on the road it will be traveling about 5 mph, so most of the highway portion will happen at night to limit traffic interference. Once settled in its new home, the magnet will be part of an experiment measuring what is called in physics the g-2 (pronounced the gee minus two) of the muon . The existing measurement is already very precise and one of the most well-defined measurements in physics. Nearly every physics theory has required it as a baseline, according to Fermilab. The goal of the new measurement is precision to 140 parts per billion -- the same as measuring the length of a football field to a precision of one-tenth the thickness of a human hair. This experiment aims to find a measurement four times more precise than the currently accepted measurement. Should that value be substantially different from the value current equations predict, it could usher in a new era of particle physics, scientists say. Fermilab has a website tracking the location of the magnet at http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov/bigmove/.","The 50-foot-wide, 15-ton magnet is now at a lab on Long Island .

"Boston (CNN) -- They could not say for certain who shot their loved ones in brutal gangland-style ""hits,"" but a series of witnesses captivated the courtroom -- and drove two jurors to tears -- Thursday as prosecution testimony continued in the federal trial of reputed Boston mob leader James ""Whitey"" Bulger. One witnesses, 63-year-old Diane Sussman de Tennen, alternated between bouts of crying and attempts to smile as she recounted the night she was in a car that suddenly was riddled by bullets, leaving her then-boyfriend a quadriplegic for the remaining three decades of his life. ""I remember hearing this noise -- a continuous stream of noise of gunfire, (like) rocks being thrown...it just was nonstop ... in retrospect it was a machine gun,"" she said, describing the night she and her boyfriend were riding home with another man, Michael Milano, after her birthday celebration at a Boston bar. When it was over, Sussman de Tennen recalled Thursday, her boyfriend was ""covered in blood and broken glass, eyes glazed over ... (he) let out a groan."" Sussman de Tennen said she reached over Milano, who was collapsed on the steering wheel, and laid on the horn until a taxi driver pulled over and called an ambulance. She learned only later that Milano was dead. ""The police told me that they were concerned for my safety because they thought I might be a target because whoever the people who machine-gunned down the car probably didn't want me as a witness,"" she said. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during the nearly two decades that prosecutors say he was the head of the Irish mob in Boston. He is also charged with extortion, racketeering and money laundering. The trial, now in its second week, has included prosecution testimony from a former hitman and Bulger colleague who testified that he and Bulger together carried out 11 killings. That witness, John Martorano, included in his testimony details about Milano's killing, with Martorano saying he and his associates sprayed Milano's car with bullets thinking it was a gang rival target. Jurors heard from Milano's brother, Donald Milano who immediately began crying and asked to pause questioning while apologizing to the judge profusely. The night before his death, Michael had been at Donald's place showing off his new car, his brother testified. ""He was very proud of it."" Donald Milano said he heard on the radio the next day that his brother had been killed, and called home to verify . Donald Milano was in court Monday when Martorano testified about shooting at Milano's car. Another witness, Deborah Scully, was stone-faced when she testified about the 1973 killing of her companion, William O'Brien. She was nine months pregnant with their child when he was shot and killed, she said, and she was unable to attend the funeral because she had given birth by then. Martorano earlier testified that he, Bulger, and their associates were involved in the killing of O'Brien. An elderly, wisecracking Ralph DeMasi, fresh out of jail after serving 21 years for conspiracy to rob an armored card, testified that he barely survived the night O'Brien was shot. He told the jury he was getting ""bad vibrations"" about a car that was trailing the two of them after they had met at a bar with a man described earlier in Martorano's testimony as a Bulger associate. ""I told Billy keep your eye on rear or side mirror and he said, ""Aw Ralph, ain't nobody gonna hurt us,"" DeMasi remembered. Then, DeMasi said, that trailing car sped up and a torrent of bullets came from it. He was hit eight times, DeMasi said, pointing out to the jury exactly where. But none of that emotional and colorful testimony put Bulger behind the trigger. When defense attorneys questioned Sussman de Tennen about who was behind the shooting she survived, she replied, ""What I say would only be speculation ... in my mind I do know, but that's for me."" In the afternoon, the jury heard from Martorano's former bookmaker, Charles G. Raso, who testified that he paid ""rent"" to Bulger and his associates, including Martorano, in the amount of $1,000 a month for ""law enforcement expenses,"" as the gang called it. Raso was originally business partners with a man named Joe Notorangeli, who the Winter Hill gang gunned down in 1973, according to Martorano's previous testimony. Raso skipped town after the murder of his partner, saying that ""I felt in fear of my own life"" and later returned when his brother indicated to him that ""it wasn't me they were interested in."" Shortly after returning to Boston, Raso said, he was ""asked"" to team up with Bulger, Martorano and the gang, an offer Raso said he had ""no choice"" but to accept. Jurors are expected to hear testimony Friday on Bulger's alleged ""informant"" file, a document the prosecution claims proves that he was protected by the FBI for providing information. According to previous testimony, it was a rogue FBI agent now jailed who tipped Bulger off to his 1995 indictment, a tip that allowed him to go into hiding for 16 years before he was captured in California with his girlfriend in 2011.","Witnesses in the ""Whitey"" Bulger trial relive shootings that left relatives, friends dead .

"(CNN) -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will remain behind bars, even though he won an appeal in which he asked to be released while awaiting a retrial, Egyptian state-run media said Monday. An appeals court granted his appeal Monday, technically freeing him in the case involving the killing of nonviolent protesters during the 2011 uprising that brought him down. But that action was made moot when the court also ordered that he remain detained in connection with newer corruption charges that were added to the older allegations, state media said. State media confirmed the court's orders Monday afternoon, after conflicting reports from state media and the country's Information Ministry about whether the orders were made. The retrial was supposed to begin on Saturday, but was delayed after the judge recused himself and walked out, leaving the court without leadership. The appeals court has 60 days to appoint a new judge for the trial, lawyers said. On Monday, Mubarak's lawyers petitioned an appeals court to release him, Egypt's semiofficial Ahram News Agency reported. Egyptian law allows the justice system to detain prisoners for just two years pending trial, but courts may extend detention for short periods of time. Because of legal technicalities, Mubarak's two years recently ran out. Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years with the help of the military, was found guilty in June 2012 of ordering the killing of protesters and was to serve a life sentence. But a court accepted an appeal, resulting in the retrial. The judge did not give an official reason for recusing himself. He used an Arabic term meaning he felt embarrassment or unease, which is a legal term judges use to declare that they are not fit to preside over the hearing. Both Mubarak's lawyer and a lawyer representing families of victims said the judge recused himself for health reasons. Others speculate that the judge stepped down because of intense criticism after he earlier exonerated several security officials who worked under Mubarak. Judge walkout Saturday . A crowd of onlookers in the courtroom Saturday erupted in jeers when Judge Mustafa Hassan Abdullah stood up to leave the court after recusing himself. Police stepped in between the angrily gesturing crowd and the judge's bench. Mubarak, who had arrived on a stretcher at the country's Police Academy in Cairo for the first day of his retrial, was quickly loaded back onto a helicopter, which flew him back to a military hospital. He had appeared relaxed in court, where he lay on a gurney inside a cage, where incarcerated defendants are customarily held during trial in Egypt. He waved to the audience in the court multiple times. Abdullah quit the case over a medical condition, Mubarak lawyer Farid El Deeb told CNN. But in announcing his departure, the judge also said he felt undue pressure in his position as magistrate. Abdullah ""submitted a medical report to the head of Cairo Cassation Court stating that he has medical problems with his eyes,"" El Deeb said. Egyptian law requires a judge to recuse himself publicly. A lawyer for the families of those killed said he believed the judge held a legal bias in the case but also corroborated the medical reason for the judge's move. ""There was also news that he had medical issues related to his eyes,"" Khaled Abu Bakr said. Bakr and El Deeb told CNN that the court of appeals has 60 days to appoint a replacement judge. Mubarak is to remain in custody at a hospital, El Deeb said. Victim's brother: 'Circus of a trial' Dozens of relatives of those killed in Egypt's demonstrations gathered outside the court, state-run Nile TV reported. They were joined by hundreds of pro-Mubarak activists carrying signs of support. Galal Faisal Ali, whose brother Naser was killed in the uprising, said he fears Mubarak will be found innocent. ""The government is not giving us the moral support we need, and they're allowing this circus of a trial to continue. We were hoping for a death sentence, but the way it's going, we may see Mubarak free, and his sons free, which means my brother died for nothing,"" he said. Magdi Fouda, the main organizer of the pro-Mubarak protest, is a member of a group called ""We are sorry, Mr. President."" She was joined by a second group called ""Sons of Mubarak."" ""We are sure Mubarak will be pronounced innocent,"" she said. State security forces formed a barrier between the opposing protesters. Emotions ran high at Mubarak's original trial in 2012, resulting in scuffles between the two sides inside the courtroom and rioting outside. Mubarak's two sons, six of his security aides and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, all face trial with him. The other defendants had also appeared at the criminal court inside the academy, state TV reported. In addition to the charges related to the killings, all face charges of financial corruption and abuse of power. Like Mubarak, al-Adly was found guilty in the original trial and sentenced to life in prison, but was granted a retrial after filing an appeal. Prosecutors have added an additional corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value. Morsy pleased about second trial . Essam El-Erian, a senior adviser to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, said in January that the government looked forward to a second trial. ""God willed the retrial would take place under Morsy's rule, with new evidence and new defendants,"" El-Erian said. Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years with the help of the military, was found guilty in June 2012 of ordering the killing of protesters and was immediately transferred to Tora prison in Cairo to serve his life sentence. The 84-year-old has suffered a range of physical problems since he was driven from office in 2011, following weeks of protests by Egyptians demanding more freedom and reforms. In December, Mubarak was transferred to a military hospital after suffering a head injury and a bruised chest when he slipped in a prison hospital bathroom, Egyptian state-run media reported.

"(CNN) -- Amid growing outrage over civilian casualties in Syria, there are ever more urgent calls to aid -- or at least protect -- the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. There is renewed talk of creating safe havens and humanitarian corridors inside the country. And those demanding tougher measures are again asking why events in Syria should not prompt Libyan-style intervention by NATO and its Arab allies. In Washington Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said the United States ""should consider all options, including arming the opposition. The blood-letting has got to stop."" So far, the international community's response to the violence in Syria has been limited. There has been diplomatic censure, with envoys withdrawn or ""recalled for consultations,"" and Syrian ambassadors expelled from several Arab states. A growing raft of sanctions is draining the Syrian regime's coffers but only gradually sapping its strength. This is not a country that has relied on international trade for its survival. An Arab League monitoring mission is in abeyance, after a much criticized few weeks on the ground that drew ridicule even from within its own ranks and fury (for its perceived complacency) from protesters. And back in November, France floated the idea of humanitarian corridors that would be protected by armed observers -- while ruling out military intervention. So far the idea has not gained traction. None of this amounts to the sort of pressure that will make the al-Assad regime buckle, especially when it perceives as divided both internal opposition and the international community. Compare the situation to that in Libya -- almost a year ago. As then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was about to unleash his forces on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, the world came together in the shape of the U.N. Security Council to authorize international intervention and prevent a bloodbath. The French and British were prime movers behind U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973; the United States an enthusiastic supporter. Russia abstained, but at the time its ambassador noted that many questions remained ""unanswered, including how it would be enforced and by whom, and what the limits of engagement would be."" Russian later complained that a humanitarian mandate had become a blank check in support of the rebels. Perhaps in part because of the bad blood over Libya, the world body has reached no similar consensus over Syria. Rather, the opposite, with some of the harshest diplomatic language traded for years. To the United States, the vetoes were a ""travesty."" German ambassador Peter Wittig essentially said that Moscow and Beijing had Syrian blood on their hands. ""China and Russia will now have to assume that responsibility in the face of the international public opinion and especially in the Arab world, the Arab citizens and, of course, in face of the Syrian people,"" Wittig said. Beyond the rhetoric, the vetoes had a more practical consequence. NATO officials have made it clear that the alliance cannot act, by enforcing a no-fly zone for example, without U.N. support. Writer Derek Flood, recently in Syria with elements of the Free Syrian Army, says NATO officials envision no role for the alliance in Syria this year. But they have not ruled out a ""coalition of the willing"" outside the NATO orbit. Both Russia and China are wary of any international action supporting protest against authoritarian rule. And Syria has been first the Soviet Union's -- and now Russia's -- key ally in the region after Egypt 'defected' in the 1970s. As it has for decades, Russia still supplies the Syrian government with weapons. One Russian analyst, Ruslan Pukhov, told CNN: ""Once the Assad regime vanishes, we have zero influence in the region."" According to Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, al-Assad has ably judged the ""diplomatic red lines"" to keep Moscow onside. There have been no massacres on the scale of what happened in Hama 30 years ago (when thousands were killed after a brief uprising against his father's rule) that might have forced Russia into a corner. The persistent drip of civilian casualties over almost a year has not unleashed a tide of irresistible outrage. Last weekend's casualties in Homs, which opposition activists said numbered in the hundreds, may have changed that. But what can be done? In Bosnia, the international community declared ""safe havens"" for Muslims but failed to protect them. The result in July 1995 was Srebrenica, the worst massacre in Europe since 1945, when some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim civilians were killed by Serb forces. Havens are only safe when protected against superior forces. Others support Sen. John McCain in arguing for arming the fledgling Free Syrian Army. Anne-Marie Slaughter, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, told CNN that is ""the most likely [option], that the Arab League countries, Turkey and probably NATO as well arms the Free Syrian Army, gives them the means to fight back. ""But then you've got a long and bloody civil war,"" Slaughter says -- reminiscent of Bosnia. Analysts say that even setting aside the lack of international will, successful intervention in Syria would pose problems not present in Libya: . Geography: Most regime targets in Libya were close to the Mediterranean coast and within easy reach of NATO air bases in Italy. Even so, NATO warplanes flew some 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce the no-fly zone, suppress air defenses and destroy command centers and armor. Military analysts say that, while no match for the best NATO members could summon, Syrian armed forces are better equipped and coordinated than anything Gadhafi could muster. Neighboring states: Few of Syria's neighbors would likely allow their territory to be used to pre-position supplies or military units. Certainly neither Iraq nor Lebanon, both countries with their own volatile sectarian mixes. The Hezbollah militia, strongly allied with Syria, remains powerful within Lebanon. The presence of foreign troops on Jordanian soil might have repercussions for a monarchy that already has plenty of problems domestically. Using Israeli territory would send the wrong message altogether. That leaves Turkey, a NATO member that has run out of patience with al-Assad. Last month, the Turkish foreign minister compared the Syrian president with former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, and on Tuesday Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned al-Assad -- pointedly in Arabic -- ""What goes around, comes around."" Turkey has military bases (Incirlik, Diyarbakir) close to the border that -- theoretically -- could serve as staging posts for intervention. But even for the Turks, there would be risks -- including a flood of refugees and possible retaliation by Damascus supporting the Kurdish terrorist group active in Turkey, the PKK. Topography: Libya was flat desert; there was little cover for regime forces and most of the fighting was along a narrow coastal strip. ""Target acquisition"" was relatively simple. Syria's physical geography is more challenging; and much of its northern border with Turkey and Lebanon is mountainous, with few major roads. Getting aid into any safe havens within Syria would be a logistical nightmare. The opposition: The Libyan rebels, for all their military shortcomings, quickly grabbed a swathe of eastern Libya and major air and seaports in Benghazi and Tobruk that became their resupply hubs. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), at best, controls a few neighborhoods in Homs and elsewhere. 'The FSA has established very small slices of liberated territory,"" says Derek Flood, who has just left Idlib province close to the Turkish border. He says the FSA is poorly armed; he was told the price of weapons on the black market has soared, ""with a used AK-47 fetching as much as $2,000 - $3,000."" Flood says the FSA in that area wants a 5 kilometer buffer zone inside Syria to provide protection from regime forces. Crucially, the regime retains control of Syria's frontiers, and its armed forces appear cohesive, according to analysts in the region. There have been military defections, mainly of low-rank conscripts, but not of entire units with their armor. Against all this and the political risks of western military action in yet another Muslim country, some argue there is a moral imperative -- as there was in Libya and Kosovo (done), Rwanda (ignored) and Bosnia (eventually.) Writing last month in The Atlantic, Steven Cook argued: ""If there is no intervention and political will to stop Assad's crimes remains absent, the world will once again have to answer for standing on the sidelines of a mass murder."" Cook -- a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -- asked: ""At what point in the body count is international intervention deemed to be an acceptably worthwhile option that can have a positive effect on the situation? After Assad has killed 6,000 people? 7,000? 10,000? 20,000?"" Scholar Fouad Ajami agrees, telling CNN's Anderson Cooper: ""Not just the Russians and Chinese, shame to the rest of us. There's abdication elsewhere, by the Turks nearby, abdication by the Arab League and Washington. Washington spent an enormous amount of time chasing after the false mirage [that] maybe we can get the Russians and Chinese on board."" Some also argue that, despite the price, there would also eventually be a strategic gain: a post-al-Assad Syria would unlikely be as close to Iran as is the current regime and might also deprive Hezbollah of critical regional support. Others see the risks of international intervention as outweighing any benefits, with the danger that civil war would inevitably spill into Lebanon. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice preferred tighter and more coordinated sanctions, saying that ""our strong preference is not to fuel what has the potential to become a full-blown civil war"" by arming the opposition. Diplomats expect a new ""contact group"" on Syria to involve at least the United States, France, the Arab League and Turkey. ""We think that the Assad regime is on its last legs, that the pressure is increasing, the economy is crumbling,"" Rice said. Syrians may already be discounting direct intervention by the West. In one YouTube video uploaded Tuesday from Homs, a doctor pleads for help from abroad. But he directs his message to the leaders of Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.","The United Nations' response to violence in Syria differs from its response in Libya .

"(CNN) -- It may seem counter intuitive. But sometimes you've got to go backwards to go forwards. So it goes for arguably the world's greatest race horse, who will attempt to extend her remarkable undefeated winning streak this weekend -- by running in the opposite direction. When Australian champion thoroughbred, Black Caviar, tries to rewrite the record books yet again in her 25th race at Sydney's TJ Smith Stakes Day on Saturday, it will be in a clockwise direction -- as is the norm for the New South Wales state. But it will be a change of pace for the Melbourne mare, better used to racing in an anti-clockwise direction in her native Victoria. A strange Australian tradition means horses race either left or right, depending on which state they're in -- clockwise for New South Wales and Queensland, and anti-clockwise for Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. This will be just the fourth time the superstar six-year-old -- worth $7.5 million in prize money -- will have raced clockwise, and co-owner Colin Madden admitted it presented the biggest challenge to her undefeated winning streak. ""It does take time for her to settle in, running in the reverse direction,"" Madden told CNN. ""So that's our biggest concern. But I still can't see any horse catching her."" Since demolishing the field in her first major win at the Danehill Stakes in 2009, an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred. The wonder mare, who even has her own Twitter handle, has not just won all 24 of her races -- with the exception of Britain's Royal Ascot she has won them by staggering margins, destroying world-class fields to become one of the top-rated race horses on the planet. Her unblemished record is the second highest of all time, trailing behind only Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s. Black Caviar's remarkable career has elevated her to celebrity status in Australia, where she was named Sportswoman of the Year, graced the cover of Vogue, and launched a best-selling biography. And when she hits Randwick Racecourse on Saturday, there's no doubt the nation will be cheering her on to what bookmakers are tipping will be her 25th consecutive win. ""They've restructured the day so that the race runs after 5pm -- that way it will be shown on TV,"" Madden said. ""Black Caviar is the feature of the day. But luckily she doesn't know how much pressure is on her to win -- we're the ones who feel it, not her."" The last time Black Caviar raced in a clockwise direction was at Britain's Diamond Jubilee Stakes, winning by the narrowest of margins in a heart-stopping finish. It was later revealed she had muscle strain in her legs which would put her out of action for eight months. Britain, like Australia, holds races in both directions, while the U.S. opts for counter-clockwise competitions. Madden didn't rule out another trip to Ascot for the magnificent mare, saying plans for future races would depend on her performance on Saturday. Beyond the track, Black Caviar may also have a profitable career as a breeding mare, with Madden hinting champion British thoroughbred, Frankel, could be a good match. Frankel, who wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot with an unblemished 14-win record, has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. ""Frankel is definitely in the mix,"" Madden said. ""He's an extraordinary horse and it could be a wonderful match -- but nothing's been decided and it's something we're still assessing.""","Can Australian race horse Black Caviar extend unblemished winning streak to 25?

"(CNN) -- The Senate approved more than $50 billion in aid to states battered by Superstorm Sandy on Monday, four weeks after a delay that sparked bipartisan fury from Northeastern lawmakers. The money includes grant funding for owners of homes and businesses, as well as funding for public improvement projects on the electrical grid, hospitals and transit systems to prevent damage from future storms. In a statement from the White House, President Barack Obama said he would sign the measure ""as soon as it hits my desk."" The 62-36 vote came after senators turned back an attempt to require budget cuts elsewhere to offset the cost of storm relief, a proposal that further irked several members. ""For decades, taxpayers from New York have sent their money when disasters occurred, with fires on the West Coast or floods in the Missouri and Mississippi valleys or hurricanes in Louisiana and Florida,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York. ""We've sent our tax dollars, billions of them -- and now, all of a sudden, some are suggesting we should change the rules when we are hit by the first major disaster to hit the New York City region in a very long time. That's not fair. That's not right."" House passes Sandy aid package . Sandy killed at least 113 people in the United States, flooded much of lower Manhattan and Long Island and smashed New Jersey seaside towns when it struck October 29. Tens of thousands of families are still displaced or lack adequate heat to deal with the winter cold that included an Arctic blast last week. Nicola Chati, a resident of New York's Staten Island, said living in temporary housing has been ""really hard on the kids."" ""They don't know when they're going home,"" Chati, whose family awaits a decision on whether their home will be repaired or condemned, told CNN over the weekend. ""That's all they want."" New York has estimated its storm-related costs at nearly $42 billion, while New Jersey's estimated losses totaled about $37 billion. In a joint statement, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy praised the Senate for approving the funds ""despite the difficult path in getting to this moment."" ""To all Americans, we are grateful for their willingness to come to our aid as we take on the monumental task of rebuilding, and we pledge to do the same should our fellow citizens find themselves facing unexpected and harsh devastation,"" they said. Before approving the relief bill, senators voted 62-35 to reject an amendment by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that would have required Congress to pay for storm relief with other cuts. Sundance stars encouraged to regift . ""My heart goes out"" to residents of the stricken area, said Lee, a tea party favorite elected in 2010. But he added, ""We have to stop and consider the fact that we are more than $16 trillion in debt and that we're adding to that debt at a rate of more than $1 trillion every year."" But Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, noted that in 2005, it took Congress just 11 days to approve $60 billion in aid for the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina, while Monday marked 91 days since Sandy hit. ""I personally am tired of listening to the voices of patience and delay and suggesting that somehow we as citizens of the United States are second-class citizens, waiting for this government to respond to the needs of fellow Americans."" Opinion: America isn't ready for superstorms . The Senate approved a $60 billion aid package for the hard-hit region in late December. But House Speaker John Boehner scrapped a vote on the bill before the clock ran out on the last Congress on January 1, leading to howls of outrage from New York and New Jersey officials. Christie, the keynote speaker at last year's GOP convention, said the move explained ""why the American people hate Congress."" Chastened House leaders quickly scheduled new votes, passing $9 billion to bolster the federal flood insurance program in the first week of January and voting 241-180 to approve another $50 billion on January 15. The Senate also passed the flood insurance bill, which Obama signed in early January. After Monday's vote, Obama said that for people struggling to rebuild, ""every day without relief is one day too many."" ""So while I had hoped Congress would provide this aid sooner, I applaud the lawmakers from both parties who helped shepherd this important package though,"" he said.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Health workers administering polio vaccinations came under fresh attack in Pakistan on Wednesday, a troubling development in a nation that remains one of three in the world where the disease has yet to be eradicated. Three workers were killed in separate attacks, a day after five others died in similar circumstances. All of them were part of a massive vaccination campaign nationwide. The attacks prompted authorities to suspend the campaign throughout the country. Read more: At the U.N., a vow to eradicate polio by 2015 . In Wednesday's attacks: . -- Two men opened fire on an 18-year-old worker as he was vaccinating children on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar. The worker died of bullet wounds to the head, said Dr. Janbaz Afridi, the provincial director of the polio campaign. -- Gunmen opened fire on a car carrying a vaccination campaign supervisor and her driver in Charsadda -- killing them both. -- Also in Charsadda, two female workers narrowly escaped when some men began shooting at them. -- Three other female workers also escaped unhurt when they were shot at in Nowshera district. All the attacks Wednesday took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province rife with Islamic extremists. On Tuesday, five workers were killed: four in Karachi; and a 14-year-old volunteer in Peshawar as she and her sister were leaving a house after administering vaccines. Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. CNN was not able to reach the Taliban for comment regarding the latest attacks. Polio, a highly infectious viral disease that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours, has been eradicated around the world except for three countries where it is endemic: Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan. After the number of cases spiked sharply last year, Pakistan stepped up its eradication efforts. The numbers fell from 173 last year to 53 this year, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.","Four attacks take place on Wednesday, killing three workers .

"London (CNN) -- Investigators are searching the London area home where the body of former Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky was found for possible chemical, radiological or biological evidence, police said in a statement released early Sunday. Circumstances surrounding the death of Berezovsky, one of the most politically influential of Russia's oligarchs until a bitter falling out with the Kremlin, were not immediately known, and authorities in the United Kingdom said it was being investigated. ""His death is currently being treated as unexplained and a full inquiry is under way,"" Thames Valley Police said in a statement. Officers, including specialized investigators, are conducting a number of searches ""as a precaution."" The body of Berezovsky was still at the house early Sunday after being discovered Saturday afternoon, the statement said. Police did not detail why authorities were searching for possible chemical, nuclear, radiological or biological evidence. Berezovsky, a fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, blamed the Kremlin for the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who died after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Putin, an accusation the Kremlin strongly denied. For years, Berezovsky bankrolled the effort of Litvinenko's widow to push for an inquest into her husband's death. Berezovsky later sued a Russian broadcaster for libel after it claimed in a report that he was behind the death of Litvinenko. He won the claim against All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (VGTRK), and the High Court in London awarded him Â£150,000 ($223,400) in damages. Death announced on Facebook . The 67-year-old was found by his bodyguard at his home in the affluent community of Ascot, Berkshire, west of London, where he was living in exile, according an official at Bell Pottinger, a public relations firm that represented Berezovsky. Word of his death first appeared Saturday in a Facebook posting by son-in-law Yegor Shuppe. Berezovsky made headlines last year after losing what has been called one of the most expensive private lawsuits in history against a former friend and ally, Russian magnate Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky sued Abramovich, owner of the Chelsea Football Club, for $5.1 billion, alleging that he was forced to sell his stake in the Russian oil company Sibneft for a fraction of its true value. The judge called Berezovsky's testimony unreliable and, at points, dishonest. The case raised a public curtain on the world of Russia's oligarchs, those who amassed massive wealth and political influence in the 1990s during the privatization of Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. Berezovsky's fortune has reportedly been on the decline in recent years, and it took a huge hit after he lost the case against Abramovich. Analysts put the price tag on legal fees alone at more than $250 million spent between the two figures. In recent weeks, reports have emerged that Berezovsky was trying to sell pieces of his estate, including an Andy Warhol painting, ""Red Lenin,"" to pay debts. From math professor to oligarch . Berezovsky began his working life as a math professor and then a systems analyst, according to CNN's Jill Dougherty, who interviewed him many times. But in post-Soviet Russia, he switched to more lucrative jobs. ""He was a smart man,"" she said. ""I'd call him a wheeler-dealer."" Berezovsky went on to sell cars ""at a time when that was a luxury,"" she said. ""There were a lot of people who wanted to buy them, and he parlayed that -- as so many of these oligarchs did -- into something much, much bigger."" While Berezovsky's made a good portion of his money from luxury car sales, his wealth and political influence bounded when he bought into Russian media. He invested in the Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corp., which -- with TBS as a partner -- founded Moscow's first independent television station, TV-6. Under President Boris Yeltsin, the Russian Federation's first president, from 1991 to 1999, ""there were really no rules governing anything,"" Dougherty said. The oligarchs, among them Berezovsky, wound up lending the fledgling Russian government money ""when it was desperate for money,"" she said. ""These guys picked up companies on the cheap -- for pennies on the dollar."" A year or two later, the companies were worth much more and they became wealthy. In return for backing Yeltsin, Berezovsky gained political influence within the Kremlin. He later backed Putin for president, pouring money into the latter's political party. Fall from political favor . But after he was elected, Putin saw that the oligarchs had the potential to gain political power and moved to thwart them, Doughtery said. It has been widely reported that Putin resented the meddling of the oligarchs, particularly Berezovsky. ""He was obviously very ambitious, and he wanted, I think, to be in political control of Russia during Yeltsin's time, and that didn't work out for him,"" said Stuart Loory, a former Turner Broadcasting System executive vice president, who was a consultant to Berezovsky during the 1990s. Berezovsky did not have an easy time of it as an oligarch. ""There were two attempts on his life, one at his country home outside Moscow in a gated community. Somebody planted a bomb in his car and, fortunately, it didn't work very well,"" he said. ""And the other was when he was leaving his club and there was a car bomb in the car and his driver was killed and he escaped without injury."" Within months of Putin's election in 2000, the government began trying to collect on tax claims against the oligarchs, including Berezovsky. It was then that Berezovsky fled. Berezovsky began agitating from Britain against Putin, calling for a coup to oust the Russian president. In 2003, as Russia was seeking his return, Berezovsky was granted political asylum by British authorities after it was determined he was wanted on political grounds, not criminal, according to published reports at the time. The case, for a time, strained relations between Moscow and London. Berezovsky was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a Russian court in 2007. Putin has been told of Berezovsky's death, spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state television. Berezovsky sent a letter about two months ago to Putin asking permission to return to Russia, Peskov said. ""He admitted that he had made a lot of mistakes, asked forgiveness for the mistakes and asked Putin to let him return home,"" Peskov said, according to a duty officer with the presidential press service. It's unknown whether Putin responded to the letter, but Berezovsky did not return. CNN's Per Nyberg reported from London, and Tom Watkins and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: Authorities search the home for possible biological or chemical evidence .

"London (CNN) -- He steered Great Britain through the perils of World War II and is recognized as one of the most important statesmen of the 20th century. But away from the world of politics, Winston Churchill was also an avid painter, drawn to scenes of stately homes in the UK, picturesque fields in France and vibrant Moroccan landscapes. Though he always saw himself as an amateur, he was quick to spot talent in others. Now, for the first time, paintings of Marrakech in Morocco by Churchill are being shown alongside those of Moroccan artist Hassan el Glaoui, who throughout his life credited Churchill with convincing his father -- the Pasha of Marrakech -- to let him pursue his dream of becoming a painter. ""The Pasha of Marrakesh was quite a fearful character and had great influence politically and great wealth, and the idea that his son was going to be a painter clearly wouldn't have come naturally to him,"" said Daniel Robbins, curator of the exhibition ""Meetings in Marrakech"" at Leighton House Museum in London. In 1943, the Pasha showed the visiting Churchill some paintings by his son and asked for his opinion. Churchill approved and the young Hassan was subsequently allowed to train as a painter in Paris. ""There weren't many people that the Pasha would listen to but if Churchill said it was alright to be painter, he could accommodate that desire,"" said Robbins. Hassan El Glaoui's career took off and he has since exhibited his work in Europe and the US, as well as in Morocco. At a sale at Christie's auction house in Paris in 2007, a painting by El Glaoui sold for 42,000 Euros ($54,000). Though El Glaoui was never able to meet and thank Churchill, the exhibition at Leighton House Museum -- which was first proposed by the artist's daughter -- is a belated meeting between the two painters. Churchill's granddaughter Celia Sandys, who helped organize the show, had been unaware of the role her father played in El Glaoui's artistic career, but said that she was ""enchanted to hear it."" After all, Churchill had great affection for Morocco, she said, and his only painting during World War II was a view of Marrakech, which he painted following the Casablanca Conference in 1943. After the conference, Churchill insisted that President Franklin D. Roosevelt make the trip to Marrakech to see the view from a tower on the edge of the city. After Roosevelt left, Churchill painted the same scene and later presented it to him as a gift. ""Painting was very important indeed [to Churchill], it was what you would nowadays call a stress-buster,"" said Sandys. ""It was the thing he loved to do more than anything."" Paintings by Churchill now command high figures -- a painting of his home, Chartwell, sold for Â£1 million ($1.5 million) at an auction at Sotheby's auction house in London in 2007 -- but when he first picked up a brush he was 40 years old and at a low point in his life. It was in 1915, during World War I, according to Robbins, and Churchill had just resigned as First Lord of the Admiralty following the disastrous campaign in the Dardanelles. ""Someone suggested that he take up painting and he had a go with his children's watercolors,"" Robbins said. ""The he tried in oils and he just became hooked on painting and it became his principle form of relaxing,"" he continued. Robbins admitted that it can be difficult to separate the paintings from the man who created them. But he said, ""It's striking just from hanging the exhibition how well his paintings stand up."" ""[The work] does deserve to be taken seriously and not solely because it's the product of this great statesman,"" he continued. ""Meetings in Marrakech: The Paintings of Hassan El Glaoui and Winston Churchill"" is on at Leighton House Museum, London, until March 31, 2012.","Exhibition of paintings by Winston Churchill and Moroccan artist Hassan El Glaoui opens in London .

"(CNN) -- Three people were taken to a hospital and others were treated at an airport after an Aruba-to-Miami flight encountered turbulence while making its initial descent into Miami, an American Airlines spokesman said. The incident occurred Tuesday night aboard Flight 1780, about 30 minutes before it landed at 6:06 p.m., Matt Miller said. Two flight attendants and one passenger were taken to a hospital, where they were treated and released, and a handful of other passengers received medical attention at the Miami airport, Miller said. ""It appears that we had approximately 12 patients,"" said Michelle Fayed, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade Fire. The turbulence lasted about 15 seconds, Miller said. The Boeing 757's seat belt sign was on at the time, and nothing on radar showed turbulence was in the area. The flight left Aruba at 3:30 p.m., carrying 185 passengers and a crew of six, Miller said.

"Washington (CNN) -- When a 7-foot bronze statue of 19th century abolitionist Frederick Douglass is unveiled at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, the event will honor a figure whose political legacy looms large but whose personal life is lesser known. Many Americans know that Douglass was born a slave in Maryland in the early 1800s and later wrote an autobiography ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American."" His tale of escape from bondage to statesman, abolitionist and activist in the women's suffrage movement is also fairly well known. But sculptor Steven Weitzman says he found that while working on the piece, Douglass was a man whose life goes far beyond the legend. Here are five things you might not know about him: . 1. He worked across the aisle . Republican House Speaker John Boehner recently called the statue of Douglass ""a fitting tribute to one of the greatest Americans and voices for freedom who ever lived."" The GOP connection to Douglass goes back centuries. Douglass had the ear of President Abraham Lincoln on matters concerning slavery and the treatment of black soldiers who fought in the Civil War. However, the two had a complicated relationship. Douglass was frustrated by what he saw as Lincoln's delayed support of emancipation. Douglass would later go on to call Lincoln the nation's ""greatest president."" During the 1888 Republican National Convention, Douglass was both a speaker and became the first African-American in a major party roll call vote to have his name put forth for president. Douglass also conferred with Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, on supporting the right of blacks to vote. What 'Lincoln' misses and another Civil War film gets right . 2. He held several government positions . At a time when many African-Americans were trying to establish lives after slavery, Douglass was appointed to several high-level U.S. government positions. He served as minister and general counsel to the Republic of Haiti. He spoke at the 1892 Chicago World's fair where he detailed Haiti's journey as a colony founded on slave labor to one governed by former slaves, and drew a connection to the African-American struggle for freedom. Douglass was also the first black U.S. marshal and served in Washington. Abolition through education . 3. He was a twice-married supporter of women's rights . Douglass was first married to Anna Murray, a free black woman who shared his passion and commitment to the abolitionist cause. She helped him escape slavery and the couple eventually adopted the last name Douglass. The couple and their five children were heavily involved in printing an abolitionist newspaper and helping support Murray's underground railroad efforts as she aided runaway slaves on their journey north. Douglass' second wife was Helen Pitts, the white daughter of an abolitionist who was very active in the women's rights movement. Douglass spoke passionately at the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights and urged the gathering to support the right to vote for both genders regardless of race. 4. He often found himself in difficult political positions . As an outspoken advocate for the right to vote for African-Americans and women, Douglass often found his relationship with those who supported similar causes strained. Abolitionist John Brown tried to convince Douglass to join the raid on Harper's Ferry, a violent and ultimately failed attempt to start an armed slave revolt. ""I...told him that Virginia would blow him and his hostages sky-high, rather than that he should hold Harper's Ferry an hour. Our talk was long and earnest; We spent the most of Saturday and a part of Sunday in this debate: Brown for Harper's Ferry, and I against it; He for striking a blow which should instantly rouse the country, and I for the policy of gradually and unaccountably drawing off the slaves to the mountains, as at first suggested and proposed by him,"" Douglass wrote in ""The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass."" Douglass also found himself at odds with longtime friend and women's suffrage advocate Elizabeth Cady Stanton, over the 15th Amendment, which prevents the government from denying citizens the right to vote based on race. Stanton had hopes to link women's voting rights to the bill; Douglass worried this would sink the measure. Douglass publicly expressed frustration with Lincoln's latent support of emancipation and once wrote of Johnson, who had blanched at meeting the black abolitionist: ""'Whatever Andrew Johnson may be, he certainly is no friend of our race.'"" Commentary: Lincoln's remarkable tie to former slave . 5. The abolitionist's statue will stand in a place built by slave labor . It is no small symbol that Douglass' statue will stand in the U.S. Capitol, a landmark built partly slave labor. They quarried the stones used in the columns, walls and floors. Douglass' statue will be featured prominently in Emancipation Hall and will be one of the first big visuals millions of Americans see when they arrive. Douglass' statue is the first to represent the District of Columbia and the third of an African-American at the Capitol. Martin Luther King Jr., and Rosa Parks from the civil rights era also have statues as does abolitionist Sojourner Truth. The unveiling comes on a day when many states celebrate ""Juneteenth,"" a day in 1865 when African-American slaves in Texas were finally told they were free. Historic milestone for African-American voters in 2012 .","Douglass worked with both Republicans and Democrats on behalf of black voting rights .
He saw a kinship in Haiti's history as a former slave colony and that of blacks in America .
He was an outspoken supporter of the women's suffrage movement .
His statue is the first to represent Washingon D.C."
"(CNN) -- I have a dog. A dog who, as I write this, is curled up quietly on the sofa, probably dreaming about dog things: Chasing squirrels. Riding in the car. His fake doggy girlfriend in California whom he's never actually met. And, just like every other night, before we go to bed, I'll open up the back door so he can prance out into the yard to drop a toaster-sized stinker on my lawn. Which I'll promptly pick up some time next month. Maybe. This entire routine required a learning curve that took all of about a week when he was just a puppy. But some of my friends have kids. Kids who, as I write this, are likely not curled up quietly on the sofa, dreaming about kid things. Because they're wildly romping around the living room, pooping in their pants. And, at least to me, this constant cleaning and changing of said pants seems far more gross and burdensome than occasionally stepping outside with a Kroger grocery bag firmly wrapped around my hand. There's no right answer here. I'm just a little unnecessarily kid-phobic. They're expensive, they tell boring stories, and most of them require guidance and understanding. Mikey just wants a rawhide. But, back to my original point, training my dog to go outside only took a matter of days. Whereas teaching children to properly use the bathroom literally takes years! However, there's a new product soon to be on the market that might just make the baby-vs.-toilet experience a little easier, if not completely ridiculous. It's called the iPotty. Naturally. Because, if there's one alphabet letter that needs to be prison-shanked and dropped into a shallow grave it's the lowercase i. That, and the capital R. Don't ask. It's personal. Anyway, the iPotty. For $40 you get a fairly normal-looking, plastic, child-sized toilet with a removable bowl. Which is great for potlucks. But the iPotty also has an adjustable stand specifically made for mounting an iPad so your child can play games and watch videos while learning to make iDoody. The creator of this product, CTA Digital, recently debuted the iPotty at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and it's become a popular story on several different websites, primarily because we now have a strong candidate for the most reckless idea ever. But never mind the fact that most people probably don't want their iPad within 30 feet of a child, much less one who's learning to drop a deuce. Kids probably don't need this much stimulation. Especially on the toilet. Mind you, I do. But I'm an adult. And it's gonna be a while. Alas, the primary goal of mounting an iPad within the iPotty is simply to get your kid to actually spend more time on the toilet learning how to properly go. And, perhaps to some parents, if utilizing technology works, so be it. The ends justify the means. All hail the iPotty! Still, what if this ultimately leads to some weird social conditioning where, even as the child gets older, he simply can't do his business without having expensive electronics right there in front of him -- a serious mental crutch. Sort of like Morgan Freeman's character, Red, from ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" who, after being released from prison, famously couldn't ""squeeze a drop"" without asking permission. With the iPotty, a kid gets socially conditioned to hold something shiny with a lithium battery to go to the bathroom. Which could some day turn ugly. ""Damn, Steve, have you gained weight?"" ""I lost my Kindle."" Other critics of the iPotty have argued that toilet training is an important bonding moment between a parent and his or her child -- that introducing games and movies diminishes the experience. I'd argue feces diminishes the experience. But if you want to blame ""Angry Birds,"" go right ahead. All in all, it's just sort of a silly idea, bribing children to use the toilet with the promise of touchscreen entertainment, perpetuating this need for visual stimulation literally all the time. But, on the other hand, we all do it. Whether it's an iPhone at work or a copy of Sports Illustrated at home, let he who is without a magazine in his bathroom cast the first stone. I honestly don't care. I have a dog. And Mikey just wants a rawhide.","The iPotty lets kids entertain themselves on an iPad during potty training .
Jarrett Bellini wonders: Is this product a little short-sighted?
Bellini: What if, when you're an adult, you lose your Kindle? Can you still go?

"(CNN) -- The San Antonio Spurs are one win away from winning the 2013 NBA championship after a 114-104 victory over the Miami Heat in Game Five of the Finals. Spurs star guard Tony Parker showed no signs of the hamstring injury which hampered him during Game Four, scoring 26 points to delight the AT & T Center crowd. ""It was a physical game. Great game. I was just trying to pace myself better, if I can say that, during the game,"" the Frenchman told reporters. ""Or else I'd be out of gas like I did in Game Four, where in the second half I didn't have enough juice and my hamstring was kind of fatigued. In this game I was trying to take my time and it helped."" Argentine Manu Ginobili turned in his finest performance of the series so far, adding 24 points and 10 assists. The Spurs opened up a 20-point lead in the third quarter, with the crowd showing their appreciation with chants of ""Ma-nu"" as Gregg Popovich's team closed on a first NBA title since 2007. ""I was having a tough time scoring, and I needed to feel like the game was coming to me, and I was being able to attack the rim, get to the free-throw line, and make a couple of shots,"" said Ginobli. ""So it felt great when I heard that. To feel that I really helped the team to get that 20-point lead, it was a much-needed moment in the series. So I'm glad to see it happen."" For the Heat, LeBron James and Dwayne Wade both scored 25 points as Miami continued a run which has seen the 2012 champions alternate between wins and losses over its last 12 playoff games.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A violent attack on a group of Chinese students in a small town in southwest France has prompted anger and condemnation in China. During the assault Friday night in the town of Hostens, south of Bordeaux, one of the students suffered a serious injury after a glass bottle was thrown in her face, French authorities said. In France to study the making of wine, the six students were at home when they were attacked by three local residents who were ""visibly in an inebriated state,"" French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said in a statement Saturday. He condemned the attack ""with great severity,"" describing it as ""xenophobic."" Two of the suspected attackers have been questioned and taken into custody, he said. The Chinese embassy in Paris on Sunday ""strongly condemned"" the attack, calling on French authorities to ""bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety of Chinese students in the country,"" the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Users of the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo also expressed anger over the attack and concern about other Chinese students living overseas. ""Hope all students studying abroad take care of themselves and help each other,"" said somebody posting on Weibo under the username @Sunzhenming. There are more than 30,000 Chinese students in the French higher education system, more than any other overseas nationality, according to the French foreign ministry. The six who were attacked on Friday had been in France for two months and are due to study there for a year. The seriously injured student, who is about 20 years old, has been transferred to a hospital in Bordeaux for treatment, Walls said. The Chinese embassy has sent officials to Bordeaux to follow up on the situation and visit the injured students, Xinhua reported. Some Chinese social media users speculated that the high-level response to the attack by authorities in Paris and Beijing was because the students are the children of senior Chinese officials. ""They must be sons or daughters of government officials, otherwise, how come they get so much attention?"" asked @Moonyaohuihua. The local French newspaper Sud Ouest reported Sunday that the young woman with the face injury is the daughter of a Chinese ""dignitary."" The Chinese foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to a request Monday about her identity. French media and Xinhua reported that the three local men had attacked the Chinese students because they believed the students had called police earlier in the evening to complain about noise they were making. CNN's Feng Ke and David McKenzie, and journalist Audrey Shi in Beijing contributed to this report.","Six Chinese students were attacked by three drunk local residents, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- Q: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is releasing new guidelines on cervical cancer screenings. What's changed? A: In the 1930s, cervical cancer was the deadliest women's cancer in America. At that time, it killed more women each year than breast or lung cancer. But over the past 80 years, there has been a tremendous decline in the death rate from cervical cancer because of improvements in treatment and screening. Today, death from cervical cancer is relatively rare in the U.S. In 2009, about 4,000 American women died of cancer of the cervix. A review of the medical history of these women showed that the overwhelming majority had never had cervical cancer screening, and most who did were screened more than 10 years before diagnosis. This week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is announcing new recommendations for Pap tests to screen women for cervical cancer. The American Cancer Society (ACS), the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) have also teamed up to publish screening recommendations. Both the task force and the collaborative groups reviewed scientific literature and came to similar conclusions. Both sets of guidelines were published Wednesday. The USPSTF guidelines were published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The ACS, ASCCP and ASCP guidelines were published jointly in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease and the American Journal of Clinical Pathology. It is hoped that these guidelines will lead to less confusion for health care providers and the public. The new guidelines advise women to reduce the number of tests they receive over their lifetime. This will ensure that women receive the benefits of testing while minimizing the risks. Most surprising of these recommendations is that women under age 21 should not be tested. But it makes sense -- many sexually active women under 21 will develop a human papillomavirus infection, or HPV, which can lead to pre-cancerous lesions. And when doctors see those lesions on a Pap test, they want to treat them. Yet nearly all of those lesions will disappear on their own without residual effects. And those that do not are easily treated years later. Treating them as soon as they're spotted can lead to cervical incompetence and miscarriage down the road. The task force has also recommended that women over 21 undergo a Pap test screening every three years, instead of annually. This, too, fits with what we know about this disease: HPV can take more than a decade to progress to cervical dysplasia or cancer. Now to the basics. The ACS-ASCCP-ASCP recommendations include these changes from the previous ACS guidelines: . • All women should start screening at age 21. No longer is screening recommended three years after starting vaginal intercourse. • Women aged 21 to 29 should get a Pap test (conventional or liquid-based) every three years. The statement specifically recommends against annual Pap testing. The former guideline called for a conventional Pap test every year, or a liquid-based Pap test every two years, for this age group. • For women 30 and over, Pap tests should be done every three years. The guidelines recommend against annual or more frequent Pap testing for this age group. The previous guidelines said women 30 and over who have had three normal Pap tests in a row may be tested less often -- every two to three years. • Combining the Pap test with HPV testing every three to five years is the preferred strategy for women aged 30 and older. • Screening is not recommended for women 65 or older who have had three or more normal Pap tests in a row and no abnormal Pap test results in the past 10 years, or who have had two or more negative HPV tests in the past 10 years. Additional recommendations are also included in the proposed guidelines: . • Women who have a normal Pap result and a positive HPV test result should repeat both tests or receive a gene test called genotyping that determines if they have HPV 16 and 18. These types of HPVs are known to cause 70% of cervical cancers. There is no immediate need for a colposcopy. (HPV 16 and 18 are the most common causes of cervical dysplasia and cervical cancer.) • Women with a mildly abnormal Pap result (called ASC-US) and a negative HPV test result should follow up with either HPV testing plus a Pap test, or HPV testing alone, at intervals of three years or longer. • Women who have been vaccinated against HPV should begin cervical cancer screening at the same age as unvaccinated women, i.e. at age 21. The views and opinions expressed in this report are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of CNN or the American Cancer Society.","In 2009, about 4,000 U.S. women died of cervix cancer .
New recommendations: Women under 21 should not be tested .

"London (CNN) -- Four people, all journalists or former journalists for Britain's Mirror Group Newspapers, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiring to hack voice mails, police in London said Thursday. The investigation is mainly concerned with the Sunday Mirror newspaper and is focused on the period from 2003 to 2004. ""This conspiracy is being treated as a separate conspiracy to the two being investigated at the now defunct News of the World newspaper,"" London's Metropolitan Police said. The News of the World was closed down in 2011 amid public uproar over the hacking of voice mails by employees of the tabloid, owned by the UK arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. A number of people face criminal charges as a result of investigations into alleged wrongdoing at the News of the World. Trinity Mirror, the UK media giant which owns Mirror Group Newspapers, named two of those arrested Thursday as James Scott, the editor of The People and his deputy, Nick Buckley.

""The police are investigating allegations of phone hacking whilst they were on the Sunday Mirror during 2003 and 2004. We are cooperating with the police and we have no further comment to make at this stage."" Police earlier said the four people arrested Thursday ""on suspicion of conspiracy to intercept telephone communications"" were three men in their 40s and a woman aged 47. They are being questioned at police stations in London, and a number of addresses are being searched, police said. Mirror Group Newspapers publishes the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and The People, as well as Scotland's Daily Record and Sunday Mail. Misconduct claim . In a separate development, a former Sussex police officer, James Bowes, was charged Thursday with misconduct in public office, UK prosecutors said. ""It is alleged that in 2010 Mr. Bowes provided information to The Sun newspaper in breach of the terms of his employment and was paid Â£500,"" a Crown Prosecution Service statement said. The information related to three high-profile investigations being conducted by Sussex Police at the time, it said. He will appear in court later this month.

"(CNN) -- Among all the woes of modern air travel -- cramped seating, extra charges for baggage, outrageous prices for airport food -- perhaps nothing frays the nerves of passengers faster than air turbulence. Well, brace yourself for even bumpier skies. And costlier flights. A pair of British scientists are predicting that the white-knuckle rocking and rolling at 35,000 feet is going to get worse. According to a paper published in the scientific journal, Nature, climate change will significantly increase turbulence over the North Atlantic, a popular route between North America and Europe. The report concludes that ""journey times may lengthen and fuel consumption and emissions may increase"" as a result. READ MORE: CNN Business Traveller . This means additional costs to airlines and, ultimately, passengers. Currently, turbulence causes about $150 million a year in damages to planes and other expenses, said Paul Williams, one of the report's authors from the department of meteorology at the University of Reading. There's a high chance overall industry costs will rise as turbulence intensifies, he said. The report is based on a study of climate model simulations that suggest changes in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will dramatically increase the jarring rattle, shake, shimmy and sudden drops known all too well to frequent fliers. READ MORE: What women want on the road . ""We only looked at winter, as this is when the jet stream is strongest, but we will look at other seasons in the future,"" said co-author Maoj Joshi, a lecturer in climate dynamics from the University of East Anglia. Study results show that the area above the North Atlantic that will experience ""significant"" turbulence will double, explained Williams. ""Significant"" turbulence can be classified as turbulence that would prompt a pilot to turn on the seat belt sign, he said. Joshi told CNN he expects to find similar results when the team looks at the North Pacific region, between Japan and the West Coast of the United States. So, in addition to everything else, expect to hear that ""keep your seat belt fastened"" reprimand a little more often as you fly the shaky skies.","Report says passengers should brace themselves for bumpier skies and costlier flights .

"London (CNN) -- Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is ""not a fit person"" to run a major international company, British lawmakers investigating phone hacking at his tabloid News of the World reported Tuesday. The ruling could prompt British regulators to force him to sell his controlling stake in British Sky Broadcasting, a significant part of his media empire. The damning report accused Murdoch and his son James of showing ""willful blindness"" to phone hacking at News of the World, and said the newspaper ""deliberately tried to thwart the police investigation"" into the illegal activity. The paper's publisher, News Corp. subsidiary News International, ""wished to buy silence in this affair and pay to make the problem go away,"" the Parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee found. Ofcom, the British media regulator that could force Murdoch out of BSkyB, said it was ""reading with interest"" the report from Parliament. The agency noted that it ""has a duty under the Broadcasting Acts of 1990 and 1996 to be satisfied that any person holding a broadcasting license is, and remains, fit and proper to do so."" News Corp., which Rupert Murdoch leads as chairman and chief executive, accepted responsibility for some failings Tuesday but pushed back against some of the more critical remarks made by lawmakers. ""Hard truths have emerged from the Select Committee Report: that there was serious wrongdoing at the News of the World; that our response to the wrongdoing was too slow and too defensive; and that some of our employees misled the Select Committee in 2009,"" it said in a statement. However, remarks made by some lawmakers after the report was issued on Tuesday were ""unjustified and highly partisan,"" it said. News Corp. said it had already acted on many of the failings highlighted in the report, had brought in new internal controls and is supporting police investigations into alleged wrongdoing. Allegations of widespread illegal eavesdropping by Murdoch journalists in search of stories have shaken the media baron's News Corp. empire and the British political establishment, up to and including Prime Minister David Cameron. Police have arrested dozens of people as part of investigations into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and police bribery, while two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry led by Lord Justice Brian Leveson are probing the scandal. Testifying last week before the Leveson Inquiry, Rupert Murdoch admitted that there had been a ""cover-up"" of phone hacking at News of the World, which ceased publication last July. But Murdoch, who owns the Sun and the Times in London, as well as controlling The Wall Street Journal, New York Post and Fox News, said his News Corp. had been a victim of the cover-up, not the perpetrator. ""Someone took charge of a cover-up, which we were victim to and I regret,"" he said Thursday at the Leveson Inquiry. He apologized for not having paid more attention to the scandal, which he called ""a serious blot on my reputation."" Tuesday's report by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee is based, in part, on earlier testimony by Rupert and James Murdoch. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the committee, said Tuesday that, while there is ""no definitive evidence to prove whether or not James Murdoch was aware of ... evidence which indicated that phone hacking was widespread, the committee was nevertheless astonished that he did not seek to see the evidence."" Tom Watson, the Labour lawmaker who has long been one of the fiercest critics of Murdoch, was blistering in a news conference announcing the parliamentary findings. ""These people corrupted our country,"" he said. ""They have brought shame on our police force and our Parliament. They lied and cheated -- blackmailed and bullied and we should all be ashamed when we think how we cowered before them for so long."" But Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament who is on the committee with Whittingdale and Watson, said the report had gone too far. She was one of the four Conservative MPs who dissented from the amendment to the report finding that Murdoch was not a fit person to run a company. She called the amendment ""faintly ridiculous,"" given Murdoch's decades in the business, and accused the Labour members of the committee of pushing through a ""nakedly political"" statement. ""The amendments were so far out of left field they made a mockery of the whole thing,"" she said. The section declaring Murdoch ""not fit"" passed by a vote of 6 to 4, with support from Labour and Liberal Democrat lawmakers, over opposition from Conservatives. Committee chairman Whittingdale, a Conservative, did not vote. The report did not accuse either Murdoch of misleading Parliament, but said three of their underlings had done so in testimony to the committee. Longtime Murdoch right-hand man Les Hinton was criticized, as were Colin Myler, the last editor of News of the World, and Tom Crone, who was the paper's lawyer for decades. Myler and Crone ""gave repeated assurances that there was no evidence that any further News of the World employee, beyond Clive Goodman, had been involved in phone-hacking,"" the report says. ""This was not true and, as further evidence disclosed to us by the newspaper's solicitors Farrer & Co now shows, they would have known this was untrue when they made those statements. Both Tom Crone and Colin Myler deliberately avoided disclosing crucial information to the Committee and, when asked to do, answered questions falsely."" Mensch noted that Myler, the editor of the New York Daily News, ""has misled a select committee of Parliament. I would hope that a little bit of attention would be paid to the unanimous findings of the committee where named individuals misled Parliament."" In a statement, Myler said he stood by the evidence that he gave the committee. ""The conclusions of the Committee have, perhaps inevitably, been affected by the fragmented picture which has emerged from the various witnesses over successive appearances and by the constraints within which the Committee had to conduct its procedure,"" he said. ""These issues remain the subject of a police investigation and the Leveson judicial inquiry and I have every confidence that they will establish the truth in the fullness of time."" The full House of Commons will have to rule on whether the three committed contempt by misleading the committee, ""and, if so, what punishment should be imposed,"" the report says. ""It is effectively lying to Parliament,"" Whittingdale said. ""Parliament at the end of the day is the supreme court of the land. It is a very serious matter."" BSkyB shares were up slightly in London on the news. Shares in News Corp., which is traded in New York, closed Tuesday up 2.64%. In a statement to News Corp.'s 50,000 employees, Rupert Murdoch said the report ""affords us a unique opportunity to reflect upon the mistakes we have made and further the course we have already completed to correct them."" He said that it was difficult for him to read many of its findings, ""but we have done the most difficult part, which has been to take a long, hard and honest look at our past mistakes."" He continued, ""We certainly should have acted more quickly and aggressively to uncover wrongdoing. We deeply regret what took place and have taken our share of responsibility for not rectifying the situation sooner."" He said News Corp. officials ""have gone beyond what law enforcement authorities have asked of us, to ensure not only that we are in compliance with the law, but that we adhere to the highest ethical standards."" Rupert Murdoch said last week that if he had known the depth of the problem in 2007, when a private investigator and a Murdoch journalist were sent to prison for phone hacking, he ""would have torn the place apart and we wouldn't be here today."" But he also suggested last week that key parts of the scandal have been overblown. ""The hacking scandal was not a great national thing until the Milly Dowler disclosure, half of which has been somewhat disowned by the police,"" Murdoch said. He was referring to the revelation that people working for him had hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old who later turned out to have been murdered. The Guardian newspaper originally reported that the hackers had also deleted some of the voice mails left for the girl, leading to false hopes that she was still alive and deleting them herself. In fact, the messages may have expired automatically. Murdoch was also grilled over his media empire's back-channel lobbying of the British government and said he learned of the existence of one of the key lobbyists only ""a few months ago."" He said he was ""surprised"" by the extent of the contact by the employee, Fred Michel, with the British government as it considered a bid by News Corp. to take full ownership of British Sky Broadcasting. That bid collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal. The scandal has also forced News Corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. Murdoch and his son James have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them. They have always denied knowing about the scale of the practice, which police say could have affected thousands of people, ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans.

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt carved his name in the Olympic record books Thursday by claiming gold in the 200 meters in London as he led a Jamaican sweep of the medal positions. The 25-year-old Bolt became the first man in Games history to defend both the 100 and 200 meters titles, which he had won in such convincing style at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. His teammate and training partner Yohan Blake chased him all the way up the finishing straight to take the silver medal. Warren Weir completed a one-two-three for Jamaica in a personal best time of 19.84 seconds. Bolt was outside his own world record with a winning time of 19.32 seconds, while Blake clocked 19.44 seconds. Wallace Spearmon was fourth for the United States. Photos: Striking the Bolt pose . The 25-year-old Bolt won the 100m final Sunday in 9.63 seconds, again relegating Blake to second place. ""It's the one I wanted I'm very proud of myself,"" Bolt told BBC Sport. ""I didn't get a world record -- I really wanted to do it in the 200m -- but I'm happy."" Blake added: ""Usain Bolt has been motivating me all season. Everything has been going good so far."" The pair, who are both coached by Glen Mills, will form a formidable half of Jamaica's 4x100 meters relay squad as they look to defend their Beijing title. Victory in the relay would give Bolt his sixth Olympic gold medal. An epic night was kick started by a sensational victory in the men's 800m for David Rudisha of Kenya. Rudisha ran one minute 40.91 seconds to break his own world record, the first in the track and field events at the Games. The 23-year-old led from start to finish and was never seriously challenged, despite a superb run by 18-year-old silver medalist Nijel Amos of Botswana. Can 'power posing' like Bolt make you a winner? Amos clocked one minute 41.73 seconds, matching the former world record time set by London Games chief Sebastian Coe back in 1981, which stood for 16 years. Another teenager, 17-year-old Timothy Kitum of Kenya, took the bronze in one minute 42.53 seconds. Rudisha, who was inspired by Coe's exploits, had promised him something special and did not disappoint. ""I was well prepared and had no doubt about winning,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I was waiting for perfect conditions to break the record and decided to go for it,"" he added. The qualifiers for the final of the women's 800 meters were led by gender row athlete Caster Semenya of South Africa. Semenya showed the form that took her to the world championship in 2009 in Berlin, easing up to win in one minute 57.67 seconds. American Christian Taylor won the men's triple jump with a 17.81 meters effort to add to his world title from Daegu last year. The artist who turned Usain Bolt from track legend to street hero . U.S. teammate Will Claye finished in the silver medal position with Italy's Fabrizio Donato taking bronze. There was further gold medal success for the United States in the decathlon as world record holder Ashton Eaton won with 8,869 points. He ended 198 points clear of teammate and two-time world champion Trey Hardee with Cuba's Leonel Suarez taking the bronze. Eaton broke the world mark with 9039 points at the U.S. trials in June where 2008 Olympic champion Bryan Clay failed to make the team after falling in the 110 meters hurdles. The final gold medal of a remarkable evening went to Barbora Spotakova of the Czech Republic, who successfully defended her javelin title with a throw of 69.55 meters. The 31-year-old dominated the competition and four of her efforts would have been good enough for victory. Germany's Christina Obergfoll and Linda Stahl won the silver and bronze.

"(CNN) -- In the 1970s and '80s, when corporate America was plagued with inefficiency, a new class of financially motivated takeover investors emerged to prey on the fattest in the corporate herd and scare the rest into line. Today, as pockets of corporate America are plagued with immorality, we need a new class of socially motivated takeover investor to prey on the sociopaths in the corporate herd, turn them around and perhaps scare (or shame) others into line. The upcoming sale by Cerberus Capital of the Freedom Group, the largest gun manufacturer in the United States, is a perfect opportunity to usher in this new era of muscular, socially responsible capitalism: . First, Michael Bloomberg, George Soros, David Geffen and the like should establish a nonprofit SPAC (Special-Purpose-Acquisition-Company) called BidForFreedom.org (BFF) with a mission to reduce needless deaths through gun violence in the United States and encourage the passage of sensible gun control regulations. They should appoint George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon to the fundraising committee and recruit a loud-mouthed, poison-penned, but good-hearted activist hedge fund titan as chief investment officer (Bill Ackman? Dan Loeb?). Opinion: Forgotten victims of gun violence . To be credible, BFF will probably need to start with at least $250 million in cash and commitments (no problem given the billionaire status of the sponsors) with additional firepower raised as needed from well-heeled individuals, foundations and through a broad-based Internet solicitation to an outraged-by-Newtown public. Second, BFF should lobby all public pension funds that are part owners of the Freedom Group (by virtue of their investment in Cerberus) to roll their investment into BFF to reduce the need for outside funding, naming and shaming any unwilling public investors. Newtown shooter's guns . Third, BFF should pay ""whatever it takes"" to acquire control of the Freedom Group in the upcoming auction by Cerberus (which has a fiduciary obligation to sell to the highest bidder) and then immediately implement a ""moral turnaround"" plan under which the Freedom Group: . (i) Appoints a high-profile CEO with impeccable credentials as a hunter and/or marksman who is nevertheless in favor of gun-control. Opinion: Guns endanger more than they protect . (ii) Elects a new board of directors including representatives from the families of victims killed in Newtown (and/or other massacres perpetrated with Freedom Group weapons), military veterans and trauma surgeons with real experience of human-on-human gunfire, and law enforcement and mental health professionals. (iii) Operates the business as if sensible gun laws were in place (this may turn out to be a wise investment in future-proofing the company): discontinuing sales of the most egregious assault weapons and modifying others as necessary so they cannot take huge-volume clips; offering to buy back all Freedom Group assault weapons in circulation; micro-stamping weapons for easy tracking; and providing price discounts for buyers willing to go through a background check and register in a database available to law enforcement. (iv) Voluntarily waives its rights to support the NRA and other lobbying groups. (v) Creates a fund to compensate those who, despite its best efforts, are killed or wounded by its weapons. (vi) Agrees that if the effort to provide moral leadership in the weapons industry doesn't succeed within a year, BFF should consider corporate euthanasia, even though it entails a risk of allowing more retrograde manufacturers to fill the void in the market left by the then-deceased company. Opinion: The case for gun rights is stronger than you think . In the face of horrors like Newtown, BFF would recognize that it's time to take a stand by acknowledging the impossibility of reaching closure after such a monstrous act while an unreconstructed Freedom Group continues to sell a huge volume of guns and ammunition rounds each year even if it is operating under new owners. Like any Trojan Horse strategy, this is a long shot, but it must be tried. History suggests that only after the first company ""turns"" will an industry gradually return to the realm of the human (think of big tobacco). And without the tacit agreement, if not the outright support, of at least one important insider, policymakers seem utterly unable to pass tough regulations in the face of the predictable but withering assault by industry lackeys shrieking that any such regulation would be ""impossible, impractical or too expensive."" In the face of a recalcitrant industry, we have to acknowledge that it is only the market for corporate control -- the real possibility that an outsider will take over one of the companies -- that puts limits on the behavior of board members and executives who, while perhaps decent enough in their family lives, display a limitless tolerance for the ""banality of evil"" at the office. Opinion: Not man enough? Buy a gun . We must accept that the conventional, kid-gloves approach to socially responsible investing -- divesting shares in ""bad"" companies that nevertheless continue to exist -- is too weak an instrument to force change and its well-meaning practitioners too soft to enter the fray when emotionally and politically charged battles need to be fought. And regardless of the viability of socially motivated takeovers in general, the Freedom Group looks like a great target. Cerberus is a motivated seller, the political macros look favorable, and it's a bite-sized company compared with many of the larger sociopaths in the corporate herd. I'm even cautiously optimistic that the current impasse over gun regulation is a bad-equilibrium that few consumers actually want, and that a reconstructed Freedom Group, fighting for sensible change as a fifth column from within the industry, might well find that many people -- even a significant portion of the NRA's members -- would buy from a truly responsible (and high quality) gunmaker if given the chance. All in all, it's a pretty exciting deal, so if Mike and George are up for it, count me in.

"London (CNN) -- The family of the British soldier killed in broad daylight last week urged people angry over the slaying to remain calm and not seek revenge. Attackers killed Lee Rigby a couple of hundred yards away from the Royal Artillery Barracks in the southeast London district of Woolwich. ""We would like to emphasize that Lee would not want people to use his name as an excuse to carry out attacks against others,"" the family said in a statement issued Friday by the Ministry of Defence. The killing has sparked an intense investigation by police. They announced two other arrests in the case Friday, of men seized on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. Authorities also moved a man arrested on the suspicion of killing Rigby from a hospital to a police station. Rigby was run over by a car and then stabbed in a daylight attack on May 22. Since the killing, anti-Muslim actions and angry social media sentiment have emerged in Britain. But the family stressed that ""it would not wish any other families to go through this harrowing experience and appeal to everyone to keep calm and show their respect in a peaceful manner."" Rigby -- who had served as an infantryman in Afghanistan and Cyprus -- ""loved life and he loved people,"" the family statement said. ""He had many friends from different walks of life -- some with different religious beliefs and cultures. But this made no difference to Lee. He always treated others with the greatest of respect,"" the family said. The death has been ""devastating,"" and the family is grateful for the public's ""overwhelming support,"" in Britain and all over the world, the statement said. ""We have been amazed by the messages of support we have received from all across the globe. We were deeply touched after visiting Woolwich on Sunday and would like to thank those who were in attendance for giving us the time and space to pay our own tributes to our beloved Lee."" The statement came as Queen Elizabeth II on Friday visited the barracks that housed Rigby -- who worked as a military recruiter as well as a ceremonial drummer. A makeshift memorial of flowers and tributes has swelled on the street outside the barracks in the days since his death. The monarch met members of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery during the visit, which was scheduled before the killing. The troop's duties include firing gun salutes on state occasions and royal anniversaries. ""The queen privately met those who coordinated the barracks response last week to the death of Drummer Lee Rigby,"" Buckingham Palace said in a written statement. An inquest into Rigby's death opened Friday at Southwark Coroner's Court and was quickly adjourned. Detective Chief Inspector Grant Mallon, the senior investigating officer into the death, detailed the circumstances of Rigby's killing: . After working a day at the Tower of London, Rigby was returning to his barracks in Woolwich when a vehicle swerved and struck him. Two men came out of the vehicle and attacked him with cleavers causing him ""extensive and serious injuries."" The two men moved his ""apparently lifeless body"" and remained on the scene until police arrived, when ""both were incapacitated and detained."" In all, 12 people have been arrested in connection with the killing. • Michael Adebowale, 22, has been charged with murder and with unlawful possession of a firearm. He was discharged from a hospital Tuesday and has been held in custody since at a police station. He made an initial court appearance Thursday. • A 28-year-old arrested on the suspicion of Rigby's murder is in custody at a south London police station. The man has been identified by family, friends and acquaintances as Michael Adebolajo. He was discharged from a hospital Friday and transferred to the police station. Police said he was ""further arrested"" at the station on the suspicion of the attempted murder of a police officer, but didn't provide detail on that charge. • Two men, ages 42 and 46, have been taken to a south London police station. One was arrested Friday in north London and the other in east London on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. • Six others have been freed on bail -- the most recent a 50-year-old man arrested Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. • Two were released without charges. Separately, a man who was arrested after he spoke in an interview about Adebolajo on BBC's ""Newsnight"" has been charged with two counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and one count of encouragement of terrorism. He is Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan, also known as Abu Nusaybah. The charges are not connected to the Rigby murder investigation, police said. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London. CNN's Joe Sterling wrote and reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is fighting a new infection, and his breathing problems have worsened, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said late Monday.

Opinon: Isn't it time to respect Venezuela's democracy? He reported Chavez is battling a new and ""severe"" infection, stressing that his overall condition remains ""very delicate."" Chavez is undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments, he said. ""The president continues to hold fast to Christ and to life, aware of the difficulties he's facing,"" Villegas said. Chavez, 58, first announced he had cancer in 2011. He spent more than two months in treatment in Cuba recently, returning to Venezuela two weeks ago. Chavez: Survivor and Venezuela's long-serving president . The government has never specified what kind of cancer Chavez has. Vice President Nicolas Maduro said Friday that Chavez is ""fighting for his life."" The president began chemotherapy after his fourth cancer surgery in Cuba in December, and he is continuing the ""intense"" treatment at a military hospital in Caracas, according to Maduro. Read more on CNN EspaÃ±ol . Since Chavez underwent surgery on December 11, government accounts about his health have been vague. After previous procedures, Chavez called state television to offer upbeat, if vague, reports on his condition. There have been no such calls in recent weeks, and he has not been seen in public. The last glimpse Venezuelans had of their leader was last month when the government released a series of photographs that showed a smiling Chavez -- his face bloated -- lying on a blue pillow, flanked by his two daughters. The president's allies maintain he is continuing to run the country, while critics say Venezuela is in limbo without a leader, and are demanding more details on his health.

"(CNN) -- The sponsor of a top golf tournament in South Korea insists it is safe to go ahead despite two American players pulling out due to security fears. U.S. Ryder Cup stars Dustin Johnson and Zach Johnson withdrew from the Ballantine's Championship Monday, citing concerns over recent tensions between North and South Korea. ""They have reached this decision following perceived unrest on the Korean Peninsula and can no longer assure their commitment to this year's event,"" Ballantine's said in a statement on the website of the European Tour, which co-sanctions the tournament with the Asian Tour. Now held at the Blackstone course at Icheon, 60 kilometers south of the capital Seoul, the â‚¬2,205,000 ($2.85 million) event was the first staged in South Korea in 2008 on the island of Jeju. ""Ballantine's and the European Tour would like to reiterate that the tournament is going ahead as planned with a full field of European, Asian and Korean PGA Tour members,"" the statement added. ""Ballantine's has been kept fully up to date on relevant issues and the European Tour has also been liaising with key decision makers, including the Foreign Office, who have not warned of any increased risk to those traveling to or within the country. World No. 30 Zach Johnson, who won the 2007 Masters, said he did not want to take the risk following North Korea's recent threats against its neighbor and its move to test missiles and restart its nuclear program. ""It was one of those things where the women in my life really didn't feel like it was necessary for me to go,"" the 37-year-old from Iowa told the Des Moines Register, referring to his wife, mother and young daughter. ""The posture and rhetoric that is taking place right now makes it not worth it. And it probably is just posture and rhetoric. However, I don't want to take the chance.""

""I feel bad for the tournament,"" said the 28-year-old, whose partner is Paulina Gretzky, the model daughter of ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. ""They were gracious and understanding. Hopefully it will work out in the future.""

"(CNN) -- A nice glass of wine, a puff on a cigar and a few clubs. It sounds like a decent night out -- except these clubs are golf clubs. When Miguel Angel Jimenez became the oldest ever winner on the European Tour following his triumph at the Hong Kong Open in November, he celebrated in the only way he knew how -- with a big, fat cigar. At 49, Jimenez, who replaced Des Smyth as the oldest winner on the European Tour at the age of 48 and 318 days, is man with a hinterland which stretches well beyond sport. While the rest of the world rushes around at breakneck speed, Jimenez often sits, looks out onto the Mediterranean and contemplates the meaning of life -- a subject he's had a lot of time to think about since breaking his leg in a ski accident last December. ""You have to do whatever you want in your life when you are alive,"" Jimenez told CNN's Living Golf on location in his hometown of Malaga. ""I love to ski, I love to drink, I love to smoke, I love to compete and I love to have time with my friends. ""I don't want to stop any of those things. I'm sorry, but I'm honest. ""Freedom is so nice, to do what you're doing in your life, to do what you want in your life -- that's genuine. It doesn't matter what."" If sport these days is characterized by a winner takes all mentality summed up by legendary NFL coach Vince Lombardi's famous remark -- ""Show me a good loser and I'll show you a loser"" -- then Jimenez's approach is the very antithesis to that philosophy. ""I do what I like in my life and I'm not going to change that. If a major is coming then it will be 'wow', but if the major is not coming, I'm still going to do what I like with my life."" A wry smile appears on his face as he waves his hand towards the camera and adds: ""Bye, bye major."" But don't let Jimenez's ""pleasure pursuit principle"" disguise the ambition which still burns fiercely within his heart -- the passion and determination to compete with the latest generation of stars remains as strong as ever. ""I spend many days a week working at the gym and if I don't at the age of 49 then I've no chance of competing with the younger ones,"" he said. ""Of course, I really enjoy having my glass of wine, having nice food and just to have a cigar with nice company and I enjoy my life. ""You know somebody told me a long time ago that this life we're going to spend more time dead than alive. So, when you're alive, live."" However, as he wrings every last ounce of pleasure out of life you won't find Jimenez telling the world about it on social media networks. While Tiger Woods tweets to over 3.2 million followers and Rory McIlroy converses with his 1.2 million fans, the Spaniard prefers the old-fashioned method of talking to people. ""But sometimes people forget that you need to enjoy it, we need to enjoy friends, we need to enjoy family and we need to enjoy the things which happen around ourselves,"" said the Spaniard. ""People identify with a lot of modern things such as computers and social networking. I feel that people have lost communication between people. ""Now there is a lot of communication by information, but I prefer to touch the people, to talk to the people."" Jimenez made his professional debut 30 years ago. During that time the clubs have got bigger and heavier -- as have the pay checks and the relentless media attention which comes with life on the Tour. ""Golf has always been professional, but now it's getting more so,"" he added. ""People are more into that and are more like horses when they wear blinkers -- they don't see sideways. ""You have to be yourself and if you're like that then it's fine, you have to respect those things, no?"" Jimenez makes no judgments on how others choose lead their lives, but he is insistence that his laid back and carefree attitude remains at the center of his equilibrium. ""The most important thing is, and I've always said the same thing, you have to enjoy what you do in your life,"" he said. ""I do a little bit of this, a little bit of that and my life is going forward. ""That is what I recommend to people. Enjoy yourself, enjoy your life and do whatever you want to do in life. ""But don't come to play golf if you want to do something else and don't do something else if you want to do golf. ""You have to make a compromise with yourself about what you want to do."" The affable Jimenez makes his comeback at Thursday's Spanish Open at the Parador de El Saler course in Valencia, providing the Spaniard with an opportunity to test out a body which has been put through months of rehabilitation. ""It's made me more determined,"" he said. ""I love the game and these three months of not competing, I'm missing some important venues. ""I love to compete. It's the only thing I know how to do properly in my life. ""It doesn't matter whether you win or not, but you're doing what you like in your life and I stopped doing things. ""I've stopped competing with the young guys. I've stopped competing in the tournaments. I miss all these things and that's what I want to do."" Jimenez's 19 tour wins remain a source of great pride of satisfaction as does his success with the European Ryder Cup team -- most recently as assistant captain at Medinah. While the next few days should give an indication of how his body is holding up, Jimenez is undecided as to how long he will continue playing at the very highest level. ""I've seen four kinds of generations and I've played with them. To me I think it's a privilege to be part of the history with them. ""I haven't won a major, but I don't regret anything. I feel satisfied to be part of all this, I feel so happy with that. ""I'm on the way back, I don't know for how long. To me I will keep competitive or in competition with the young people for as long as I can play well and win a tournament. ""But if I don't play well and just finish winning it's time to go.""","Miguel Angel Jimenez is set to return to action at this week's Spanish Open .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Jeremy Lin's improbable success in the NBA has prompted a spate of ""gee-whiz"" stories and added ""Linsanity"" into everyday lexicon. The little known Asian American, who at 6'3"" (1.91 meters) tall, has been leading the New York Knicks to successive wins, even without its recognized superstars. ""To pull off 20+8 (an average of 20 points and 8 assists) in six successive games shows Jeremy Lin is no fluke,"" says Ma Jian, a basketball commentator in Beijing. The Knicks made it seven on Wednesday after a 100-85 win over Sacramento in New York, with Lin managing a career-high 13 assists. Watching the 23-year-old point guard spin a 360, or finish a clean slam dunk, or sink a buzzer-beating three pointer against the best teams in the NBA is ""incredible,"" says Ma, himself a sharp-shooting former member of China's national basketball team. My family has also been quite giddy over Lin's successes. China and Taiwan vie for a piece of Jeremy Lin . I have been a basketball fanatic all my life. I played as a back up guard for the Peking University varsity team when I studied there in the late 1970s. I sometimes play pick up games on Sundays. Vicariously, I feel like a winner whenever Lin wins. Michelle, my 20-something daughter has snapped up a Knicks jersey bearing ""No. 17"" and Jeremy Lin's name. She had just bought a ticket for Friday's Knicks game against the New Orleans Hornets. Her elder brother Joseph, a Los Angeles resident, cannot stop talking about Lin's spectacular game last week against the vaunted LA Lakers. ""It was intense,"" he says. ""Sports commentators have been all over Jeremy Lin after that game."" In China, sports fans and commentators are quick to claim Lin, an American born to Taiwan immigrants with roots in mainland China. NBA's 'Linsanity' offers marketing promise . ""He is Chinese no matter what,"" says Wang Dong, a Shanghai-based sports commentator for Dragon TV. ""He is associated with China and our culture, he knows the language -- though not fluent."" Wang says Lin visited China in the summer during the NBA lockout and had talked with Yao Ming, the hulking Houston Rockets center who retired from the NBA last year. With their homegrown hero in retirement, millions of basketball fans in China are seeking a new role model. ""Lin gives hope to regular-sized players,"" says Wang. ""He shows that regardless of size, height and weight he could make his presence felt in the NBA. He shows that we Chinese can boast of more than just giant players like Yao Ming."" Frank Hawke, who also played in the Peking University varsity team in the late 1970s, agrees. ""Previous Asian players in the NBA have been physically imposing, but few regular players can relate to Yao Ming."" Lin, hoops analysts say, fills China's point-guard gap. ""Like (Phoenix Suns' point guard) Steve Nash, he combines a high basketball IQ with athleticism. Like Nash he makes his teammates better,"" says Hawke. For decades, Chinese basketball has been geared to finding super tall Chinese who could be trained early to compete with the world's best. In the minds of many Chinese coaches and team managers, Chinese and Asians in general cannot compete with African-Americans or Eurasians without height advantage. That is why China has failed to produce world-class point guards. ""Lin's success is really an indictment of the Chinese basketball system and its focus on developing big men,"" says Hawke. ""China has hundreds of millions of males, most of them regular size in stature and they cannot develop a single NBA-caliber guard?"" Brook Larmer, author of ""Operation Yao Ming,"" a book on Chinese basketball and the rise of Yao, explains: ""The system basically recruits on height and also inculcates great obedience, discipline and hard work, but it doesn't bring creativity, independence, and leadership, which are qualities that a great point guard needs."" Lin shows those qualities. ""Lin was born in America,"" says Ma. ""He has no language and cultural barriers and he is familiar with the NBA."" Lin also has a growing legion of fans. On social media, he has more than one million followers on Weibo, compared to his almost 400,000 followers on Twitter. Others admire Lin, a university graduate, for striking a balance between education and sports. ""In China, if you want to be a sports star, you go to sports schools to train and train and forget about attending a regular college,"" says Dragon TV's Wang. ""Lin is an excellent basketball player who also went to Harvard, and that is why he is such an inspiring example for Chinese."" Lin also inspires Chinese Americans like Shawn Shieh, editor of the China Development Brief, an English-language journal who, like Lin, has ties with Taiwan and the mainland. ""As a group we tend to be seen as sports challenged,"" Shieh explains. ""The stereotype is that we excel in math or the violin so having someone like him who excels in mainstream American sport is refreshing. It brings a new dimension to who we are and what we can be. He also represents the American dream because of his underdog status."" Lin was overlooked by most NBA teams until the New York Knicks, desperately looking for a point guard, picked him. He also earns much less than many of his teammates. But the question lingers: how long will Lin's magical run last? ""The NBA is a grind and he is not used to playing the minutes,"" notes Hawke, who watched Lin play for his high school team in Palo Alto, California. ""Opponents will get physical with him. When (Knicks superstar) Carmelo Anthony comes back (from injury), his minutes may go down."" Still, former national team player Ma gives Lin a fair chance to score well. ""He can use his high basketball IQ to make up for his physical handicaps,"" he says. That demands high Lin-tensity.","In China, sports fans and commentators claiming Lin, an American born to Taiwan immigrants .

"(CNN) -- Among the 35,000 runners lining up at this Sunday's London Marathon, there'll be the usual pre-race nerves, waves of excitement, and focus on the task ahead. This year, there will also be silence. Six days after Boston's Marathon was rocked by the bombing which killed three people and injured more than 180, the world will be turning its gaze to London's premier race. It will be unlike any other race in its 32-year history, as thousands of competitors and spectators observe a 30-second silence ahead of the starting gun, in remembrance of Boston's casualties. Haunting images of bloodied victims scrambling down smoldering streets, past upturned stands which just moments earlier had been filled with cheering family and friends, will no doubt loom large in the minds of Londoners this weekend. Expect to see an ocean of black solidarity ribbons pinned to the chests of runners, as they wind their way past the Capital's most iconic landmarks such as Big Ben and Tower Bridge. In another act of solidarity, for every competitor who crosses the finishing line, race organizers plan to donate $3 to The One Fund Boston, set up to raise money for victims of the blasts. Photos: After the explosion -- moment by moment . 'In it together' ""Now there is a huge feeling of defiance,"" three-time London winner Paula Radcliffe told CNN. ""How dare someone attack sport and humanity in this way -- we are not going to be cowed,"" added the 39-year-old Radcliffe, who is the world marathon record holder. Watch: Bombing victim couldn't hear after blast . That defiance is shared by the thousands of competitors who run the London Marathon to raise money for myriad charities. ""It's important to see on mass that we're in it together,"" said 36-year-old asset management worker, Ed Lucas, who will be running his first ever marathon on Sunday. ""It does make you reassess the race. But I think if anything, it will make people a lot more determined -- Brits are quite stubborn, they don't like being told what to do."" Another runner Matthew Huntington, 36, said his family -- including his two and five-year children -- would be coming to watch him. ""It never entered my mind to drop out and yes it made me even more determined to take part,"" added technical marketing manager Huntington. ""If you're completely risk averse you would never leave the house."" Stepped-up security . Security will also be stepped-up at the event, which is the first international marathon to follow Boston. There will be an increase in searches and officers on the street, London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howard, said. ""We've no reason to think people are any less safe than they were before the terrible events in Boston,"" he added. Olympic training . Last year's Olympic Games has also bolstered London's credentials when it comes to hosting safe, international sporting events, Britain's culture secretary, Maria Miller, said. ""You will know from London 2012 last year, this country has a great deal of experience of ensuring our sporting events go well and that security is at the heart of the planning process. The London Marathon is no different,"" she told the Commons this week. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised security would be ""double, triple, quadruple checked."" Show of support . With tight security measures in place, the public has been urged to get behind the great British sporting event -- as much for the competitors on the day as a sign of solidarity with Boston. ""Obviously, in light of what happened in Boston, we've had to have a look at security and we have a detailed and well-thought-out plan with the Metropolitan Police which we have year-in, year-out,"" London Marathon chief executive, Nigel Bitel, said. ""It's a great occasion, the London Marathon, and I know that people will want to come out and send a message of support to runners on the day."" Watch: Eyewitness images of blast . No fear . Similarly, reigning marathon champion, Wilson Kipsang, told competitors to try and put security issues out of their minds as they wind their way along the 42 kilometer route from Blackheath to Buckingham Palace, home of the Queen. ""When you are running and you are thinking something like that can happen, you can't concentrate,"" the Kenyan told Athletics Weekly. ""We should have no fear during the race because security matters will be put in place and we will run feeling free.""","Six days after Boston Marathon bombings, thousands of runners will compete in London .

"(CNN) -- A stunt plane crashed at an Ohio air show on Saturday, killing two people, organizers said. A wing walker was performing on a Stearman biplane when it plunged to the ground, FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. The aircraft crashed and exploded in a grassy area between two runways at the Vectren Dayton Air Show, Lunsford said. Video from CNN affiliate WHIO showed the plane in flames after it hit the ground. In a statement on its website, the air show said there were no injuries. Before the crash, an air show announcer described wing walker Jane Wicker balancing on the plane as it hurtled forward at 110 mph. ""You're facing that wind and then you have to fight the wind, and then you have to get yourself back upright. ... Watch this, Jane Wicker sitting on top of the world,"" the announcer said. Seconds later, the plane plummeted and the crowd erupted in screams. The FAA's website lists Wicker as the registered owner of the plane. WHIO reported that Wicker, who is well-known among the stunt show community, was onboard. A Facebook page devoted to the stunt performer said she had been killed. ""It is with sad hearts that we announce that Jane Wicker was killed while performing at the Vectren Dayton Airshow,"" the Jane Wicker Airshows Facebook page said. ""We ask for your prayers for the families and privacy of all involved and allow them time to grieve and work through these events."" The Dayton air show's website describes her act as ""daring and breathtaking."" ""With no safety line and no parachute, Jane amazes the crowd by climbing, walking, and hanging all over her beautiful 450 HP Stearman aircraft she affectionately calls 'Aurora,'"" the description says. A website for Wicker's company said she started wing walking after answering an ad in the Washington Post classifieds. ""She answered that ad thinking that wing walking would be an exciting way to enter the airshow business, not to mention a lot of fun,"" the website said. ""Her first time airborne on the wing also happened to be her first show. She fell in love with it."" The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating Saturday's crash. The remaining air show performances scheduled Saturday were canceled. The show will resume on Sunday, officials said. In 2012: Thousands remember 11 killed at Reno Air Races . CNN's Catherine E.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Cui Jian burst onto the music scene in China 26 years ago with his signature number, ""Nothing To My Name."" He was one of the first Chinese musicians to bring rock 'n roll to China during the 1980s as the country began to open up to western influences. He is still making waves today with his fusion of western and Chinese styles. ""The essence of rock n' roll is energy and personality,"" he told his fans who gathered in Beijing this week to commemorate his breakout performance. ""The burst of energy in the artistic creation comes from the suppression of personality."" The invited guests had just watched a special screening of ""Transcendance,"" a 3-D video of Cui's recent concert with the Beijing Philharmonic Orchestra, which will be released later this summer. Organizers gave each guest a piece of red cloth. Some tied it on their arms, others on their foreheads -- a nod to the red blindfold Cui often wore when he sang his politically-charged love song, ""A Piece of Red Cloth."" His supporters were left heady with nostalgia. ""That time, we really had nothing,"" recalled Bai Qiang, producer of the 70-minute video. ""We had no fridge, no camera, no cell phone, nothing. But we were full of spirit. Today, we are much better off but we feel have lost something. Something is still missing."" Sometimes amusing, sometimes plaintive but often overtly political, Cui's songs challenged conventional Chinese ideas and attitudes. Some commentators interpret his songs as allegorical reminders of authoritarian control. The mournful ""Yiwu Suoyou,"" or ""Nothing To My Name,"" captured the frustrations and idealism of the 1980s generation, as Deng Xiaoping's policies of economic and cultural liberalization resulted in some foreign culture seeping into China. The character in the love song beseeches his girlfriend to accept him, even though he has nothing to his name. The song struck a chord with many. Yue Zhang was 16 when she first heard Cui's songs. ""I was in high school, when boys were forbidden to wear long hair or bell bottom pants and girls were forbidden to wear colorful clothes,"" she said. ""Nobody heard of Michael Jackson or hard rock. Everybody went crazy when we first heard Cui Jian's songs. It was a break from tradition."" Over the years, I've watched Cui Jian -- ""CJ"" or ""Lao Cui"" (Old Cui) to friends -- perform in concerts, big and small, often belting out songs with a symbolic red band tied over his eyes. I also remember seeing British duo Wham! in 1985, one of the the first gigs by a major rock n' roll group in China. During the performance at Beijing's Worker's Stadium, most of the 10,000 people in the audience sat riveted in their chairs, watching with shock and awe as the long-haired rockers pranced on stage singing ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go."" Such music, like Cui's, would have been unthinkable during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when foreign culture was branded as ""spiritual pollution."" ""Rock n' roll music was not considered serious,"" Cui recalled. ""It was for people who drink, meet girls, take drugs and don't want to work on a schedule."" In his teens, Cui was not destined to become a rock singer. His father was a professional trumpet player and his mother a member of a Korean minority dance troupe. He himself started learning trumpet at age 14, playing mostly classical pieces. In the early 1980s, however, he began listening to western rock n' roll on cassette tapes he bought or borrowed from foreign friends. Inspired by Bob Dylan, he learned the guitar, formed a band and started performing in public. During the Tiananmen protests in 1989, students on hunger strike on the square adopted Yiwu Suoyou (Nothing to my Name) as their anthem. At the height of the protests, Cui even gave an impromptu performance in the square. Two decades later, his loyal fans are still inspired by him. ""We are still yiwu suoyou in our mind,"" said Yue Zhang, a white collar worker in Beijing. ""We have money, a house, a car but in terms of spirit we are yiwu suoyou."" Cui is known today as the grandfather of Chinese rock n' roll. However, many Chinese are not aware of who he is. Observers say this is in part because he has fundamentally refused to compromise his art for commercial or political gain. ""He is a pioneer,"" said Charles Xue, a prominent Chinese blogger. ""He has an ideal and he sticks to it. He's the least corrupted star I know. Everyone else will sell their soul for a few pennies in a hurry."" But Cui, now 51, has mellowed too, willing to make small compromises. ""In this 3-D film, some lines had to be taken off and some songs were disallowed,"" he told his supporters, referring to the hand of the Chinese authorities. ""We have had to remove them to save the whole work. Such compromise is made so we can deliver the other messages. We hope everyone can understand that."" Still, he bats for artistic freedom. ""If by simply telling the truth of people's sufferings, an act is considered as anti-stability or anti-system, then it's absolutely wrong. Change is inevitable, so why not make it happen as soon as possible?"" ""It took us almost two years to finish the 3-D film,"" said producer Bai Qiang. ""I feel this is what China needs now. I want this film to deliver this message, whether we have changed the world or whether the changed world has changed us."" Christie Wang contributed to this story.","Cui Jian one of the first Chinese musicians to bring rock 'n roll to China during the 1980s .

"(Mental Floss) -- It started as body parts you jabbed into real potatoes and became a cultural phenomenon, resulting in some sweet film roles and government work. Let's go back to the beginning. 1949: A Spud is Born . Brooklyn-born toy inventor George Lerner tries to capitalize on kids who like to play with their food. Surprisingly, Lerner's idea of creating face and body parts that can be jabbed into potatoes is a hard sell. Toy companies worry that parents who've just lived through World War II-era food shortages will balk at the thought of wasting perfectly good food. 1952: The Tuber Spreads . Hasbro sees the genius in Lerner's product and agrees to market it, creating the first-ever TV ads for a toy. It turns out that parents have few misgivings about squandering their potatoes; more than 1 million Mr. Potato Heads sell that year alone. Mental Floss: The map with only 38 states . 1950s: Family Man . Mr. Potato Head gets an arranged marriage. In 1953, Hasbro outfits him with an instant family: Mrs. Potato Head, son Spud, and a daughter, Yam. He also gets a car, a boat, and a kitchen in the deal. Within a few years, the likable Spud makes friends with pals Katie the Carrot and Pete the Pepper. 1964 and 1974: Attack of the Rotten Potatoes . When parents complain about finding moldy potatoes under their kids' beds, Mr. Potato Head ditches his organic body for a plastic one. Ten years later, new rules about choking hazards compel Hasbro to merge the head and body into one legless lump. Mental Floss: Shel Silverstein's unlikely rise to kid lit superstardom . 1980s: Fries on the Side . Arnold Schwarzenegger and the President's Council on Physical Fitness give him an award for abandoning his couch-potato lifestyle. Curiously, his new healthy habits don't stop Mr. Potato Head from endorsing Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's and Hardee's. 1992: A Spokesspud is Born . Mr. Potato Head trades his dapper hat for a green baseball cap and exchanges his loafers for blue tennis shoes. In keeping with his new, sportier look, he also quits smoking in 1987 for the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout. To show his support for the anti-smoking campaign, he publicly hands over his signature tobacco pipe to U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. 1995: Supersized . Mr. Potato Head makes his big-screen debut in ""Toy Story"", but his most prestigious gig is yet to come. In 2000, Mr. Potato Head becomes the official travel ambassador for Rhode Island, ""the Birthplace of Fun,"" where Hasbro is headquartered.

"Beijing (CNN) -- ""Those who win become emperors, those who lose become bandits."" This old Chinese adage may be an apt subtitle to the political drama that has been playing in China in recent months. It climaxed this week when Bo Xilai, a popular and polarizing politician, was dismissed as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, the biggest metropolis in China. Bo's dismissal is the most sensational political scandal to hit the Chinese Communist Party in recent years. China axes Bo Xilai from Chongqing after scandal . As a son of a revolutionary veteran and an official with a solid, albeit controversial record, Bo was considered a strong contender for promotion into the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo, whose nine members decide how to run China. In autumn this year, the Communist Party Congress will convene in Beijing to confirm sweeping changes in this 1.37 billion-strong nation. Held every five years, it will set national priorities and choose a new set of leaders. The stage is set for the race to the top. That race is opaque, mostly decided inside the leadership compound in Zhongnanhai by various factions and vested interests -- conservatives, reformers, party apparatchiks, technocrats, regional leaders, army officers and princelings -- or taizi, referring to the children of veteran officials. Why Chinese succession matters . For years, Bo seemed destined to succeed in a career that befitted his pedigree as a princeling. I knew Bo when we both studied at Peking University's history department in the late 1970s. I majored in Chinese history, he in world history. We sometimes ate lunch together, standing while eating around a table with other classmates in the university cafeteria (there were not enough stools for every diner.) We typically talked about current events and debated history and politics. Bo was particularly keen to practice speaking English with foreign students like me. ""His top ambition then was to be a Chinese journalist posted overseas,"" recalls a classmate and close friend of Bo. Two years later, after getting his Peking University degree, Bo got into the master's degree program in journalism, the first ever, at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. After graduation, however, Bo did not pursue his ambition to become a foreign correspondent. Instead, he worked his way up as a local party and government official. He spent 17 years in Dalian, a charming but gritty coastal city in northeastern China. He became Dalian mayor in 1993 and transformed it into a popular investment and tourism destination. As early as 1999, Bo was expected to move to Beijing for a ministerial post but his promotion was aborted when he failed to get elected into the Central Committee, the Communist Party's ruling elite. Meantime, Bo served as the governor and later party chief of Liaoning, a rust-belt region in northeast China which then boasted of large but mostly money-losing state-owned enterprises. In Liaoning, Bo dealt with high unemployment and endemic corruption. In 2004, when Bo finally got elected into the elite Central Committee, he moved to Beijing as minister of trade and commerce. ""He was a tough and effective negotiator in terms of defending China's global trade policies and interests,"" said Wenran Jiang, a professor at the University of Alberta and Bo's former classmate at Peking University. For decades, Jiang recalls, Bo stood out as one of China's most dynamic and maverick politicians. I too have seen Bo impress foreign business and political leaders with his charisma and political savvy. Instead of reading prepared speeches or reciting memorized lines, for example, he often spoke extemporaneously. ""Bo is a populist leader,"" says Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, who also remembers Bo as a fellow student at Peking University in the late 1970s. ""His populist and sometimes emotional appeal sets him apart from the rest of the technocratic leaders who can certainly win the contest for the most boring politicians,"" Tang opines. ""He would have had a chance to become China's top leader, if China had direct elections. But he shows too much personality and charisma in the post-Mao political culture that emphasizes collective leadership."" Bo gained national prominence -- and a host of enemies -- when he moved in to Chongqing in 2007. There, he made his name by ""striking black"" and ""singing red."" Striking black (dahei in Chinese) refers to a ruthless, relentless crackdown on corruption and gangster activities. Singing red (changhong) refers to mass-singing of militant Cultural Revolution (1966-76) songs that harked back to Maoism. Bo's ""strike black"" campaign implicated millionaires, local officials, police officers and gangsters involved in bribery, prostitution, gambling, drugs and guns. During the crackdown, Bo relied mainly on Wang Lijun, a tough and decorated policeman who served as Chongqing's police chief from 2009 to 2011. The campaign led to thousands of arrests and several executions. Wang was promoted to vice mayor as a reward. Ironically, it was also Wang Lijun who torpedoed Bo's career. On February 8, Wang was unexpectedly reported to be ""on leave"" for health reasons. Days later, Wang mysteriously fled into the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, six hours' drive away from Chongqing. The next day, Wang left the consulate ""of his own volition,"" U.S. officials said, and was taken into custody by security officials. Asylum rumors sparked by China crime buster's 'medical leave' It remains unclear why Wang attempted to seek refuge in the U.S. consulate and what repercussions his action may have. The ""Wang Lijun Incident,"" as the Chinese media calls it, has been under investigation. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao this week said the results of the investigation will be made public and ""should be able to stand the test of law and history."" Meantime, the scandal has led to Bo Xilai's humiliating downfall. Beijing is abuzz with rumors that worse punishment may await Bo. On China's treacherous road to the pinnacle of power, it takes only a few wrong turns for a maverick politician to end up like a ""bandit.""","Bo Xilai's sacking is the biggest political scandal to hit China for years .

"(CNN) -- If there's a top reason pubs are popular in Ireland, it's got to be the weather. Gray skies and chilly Atlantic mists have a way of driving you indoors to drink. But those who prize challenge over comfort will find outdoor adventures year-round in every corner of the country. Some, like surfing, are well-established activities in Ireland; others, like skiing, are not. All of them, though, promise the satisfaction of knowing that you didn't let wind or rain stop you from having fun. And after you've donned that wetsuit or climbing harness, you know a pint of the black stuff is going to taste oh, so much better. Here are six activities to help you work up a thirst: . Riding the waves . Among surfers, Ireland has developed a reputation for thrilling waves. Taste the fun at the West Cork Surf School (soon to be called Inchydoney Surf School). The beach's gradual gradient makes it good for beginners, said school owner Colum McAuley. ""When the waves break, they roll in for a long distance so you have a lot of time to get to your feet."" Still, rip currents are a danger at any beach, and the school emphasizes safety. Lessons run on weekends from October to May and daily from June to September. One two-hour lesson is about $45 and students can arrange additional lessons on consecutive days for a lower rate (a five-day course is about $180). Wetsuits and all equipment are provided. Call to book lessons. Westcorksurfing.com 353-86/869-5396 . An Irish chef's picks for St. Paddy's fun . Peaceful paddling . Kayaks let you appreciate Irish waterways without (necessarily) getting soaked. The Outdoor Discovery Adventure Co. specializes in kayaking and is based in the midlands, a region laden with rivers, lakes and canals but one that attracts relatively few tourists. Courses cater to a range of skill levels from From Learn to Kayak to Advanced Whitewater. There's also body boating, in which riders lie head first on a ""bellyak"" and paddle with their arms. Guided half-day activities cost about $58 for adults and $45 for kids with equipment, helmet and lifejacket included. The company operates year-round, at various locations in Ireland for groups of four or more people. Call or book online. Outdoordiscovery.ie 353-87/272-1245 . 10 tours for every kind of drinker . Hurtling downhill . The sight of large, transparent spheres tumbling down hillsides makes zorbing strangely beautiful to watch from afar. Yet anyone inside the plastic zorb ball, hurtling head over feet at high speed, is more occupied with adrenaline than aesthetics. Adventure West, on the west coast in County Mayo, has worked with the sport's New Zealand-based inventors to design a course and offers two versions of zorbing, harnessed and hydro. Harnessed is described as ""more extreme"" and faster; it's also more likely to be canceled if winds pick up. For hydro, warm water is pumped into the ball to create a kind of rolling water slide. With two people in a ball, both versions cost about $17 per person for the first roll and $13 for the second. Open weekends and holidays in the spring, daily July-August, and for groups only September-October. Adventurewest.ie 353-87/362-7828 . Easy drinking green for St. Paddy's Day . Hit the slopes? The prospect of skiing in Ireland, where the mean winter temperature is roughly 42 degrees, may be hard for Coloradans and Vermonters to take seriously. But if you're in the market for a beginner's lesson on the slopes, the Ski Club of Ireland is a unique low-key place to try one. Located in south Dublin and accessible by city bus, the Ski Club is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting skiing and snowboarding. Its outdoor slopes are made of Dendix and Snowflex, synthetic bristled materials that are misted to create a slick surface substituting for real snow. The facility is open all day on weekends and on evenings during the week from September through March. Inexperienced skiers and snowboarders must take classes; one 90-minute class is about $59 or $37 for teens including equipment rental (there are special classes for younger children). Skiclub.ie 353-1/295-5658. Catching air . Combining surfing with airborne interludes, kitesurfing can accurately be called an extreme sport. Start off slow at Sky High Kitesurfing in Tramore, County Waterford. Lessons begin with a bit of theoretical background and then proceed to the water, where you'll be strapped to small (2-4 meter) kites that owner Barry Drea describes as ""very controlled,"" even when used by a lightweight adult or a child. A one-day, three-hour course is about $130, including equipment and wetsuits; for about $470 you can take a three-day, 12-hour course designed to teach proficiency. Drea allows no more than three students per instructor but can also arrange private lessons tailored to individual needs. Lessons run year-round, but must occasionally be rescheduled if winds are either too strong or nonexistent. Call or complete an online inquiry form for more information. Skyhigh.ie 353-87/790-7480 . Climb up . Ireland's mountains have long beckoned to wanderers -- Croagh Patrick in County Mayo is named for the saint, who supposedly fasted on its summit. That scaling tradition has translated into an embrace of rock climbing as a sport, and shouts of ""On Belay!"" now echo through the country. Vertigo Outdoor, based in scenic County Wicklow, will help you get to grips with a rock face. The company offers courses for beginners, as well as those who are learning to lead. Most sites are in the Dublin and Wicklow area, but clients can arrange to go farther afield -- to western sea cliffs, for example, or up Ireland's highest mountain, Carrantuohill, ""the hard way,"" says operator Rob Davies. Half- and full-day courses are about $52/$98 per person when at least two people sign up. Family Rock Fun, a two-day course, holds the promise of quality bonding time and costs about $520 for a family of four.

"(CNN) -- Surging rivers in the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia caused widespread flooding Wednesday in the region. Heavy rains had swelled the Elbe, Danube and Vltava rivers over the weekend, along with smaller rivers and tributaries. The flooding prompted the evacuation of about 25,000 people in Germany and about 20,000 in the Czech Republic, where about half of the country's regions were under a state of emergency, officials said. Eight people have died as a result of the floods in the Czech Republic, fire service spokeswoman Nicole Zaoralova said. Read more: Floods bring misery to central Europe . ""The situation is still critical in the city of Usti,"" she said. ""We are expecting the situation on the River Labe (Elbe) in the northern Bohemia region of Ustecko to become worse during the day. The river has not peaked yet, and the levels are rising."" More heavy rain was predicted for the weekend. After it passes through Usti nad Labem, the Elbe crosses into the eastern German state of Saxony; German cities downstream such as Dresden were expecting the surge to arrive within two days. The river was expected to crest Thursday or Friday near Dresden and Meissen at about 9 meters (30 feet); its average level is 2 meters, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. The crest will push northwest along the Elbe for the next several days but should peak below 2002 flood levels, he said. The floods are thought to be the worst since August 2002, when swaths of Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia, Russia and Romania were submerged. Mud clearing . A state of emergency has been declared in about half the regions of the Czech Republic, the European Emergency Response Center said. The Czech fire service was moving heavy equipment to regions at risk, Zaoralova said. In some areas of southern Bohemia, the focus was shifting to cleanup, with equipment deployed to clear mud. Nearly 23,000 firefighters, including volunteers, were deployed across the Czech Republic, she said. CNN iReport: Floods in Prague through a volunteer's eyes . The Vltava River had peaked in Prague, where waters were receding, but the fire service was monitoring the waters to clear any debris that could damage the capital's historic landmarks. An excavator was moved onto the centuries-old Charles Bridge to protect it. Volunteer efforts . Saxony appeared to be the most vulnerable area Wednesday, after river levels dropped slightly in much of Bavaria, to the south. Warnings were in place around the rivers Elbe, Lausitzer Neisse, Mulde, tributaries of the upper Elbe, Black Elster, Spree and White Elster, according to the German meteorological service. Danny Arguello, an international business student in Dresden, told CNN iReport that he was impressed by the outpouring of support as volunteers tried to protect the city. ""The participation around the whole town is just amazing,"" he said. Volunteers were cooking food, moving sandbags and helping with other flood preparations, he said. Water remained high on the Danube between Regensburg and Passau, in southern Bavaria, the meteorological service said. In Passau, where the Danube is joined by two other rivers, levels broke a 500-year-old record Tuesday. During a visit to affected areas Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised to deliver 100 million euros (more than $130 million) in emergency aid. The German military has been aiding evacuation and flood defense efforts. A fireman and a laborer died Saturday in Germany's southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the state's Interior Ministry said. A third man jumped into rushing flood waters in what the Interior Ministry said was an apparent suicide. Two men who were clearing storm debris died in Austria in separate incidents, Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundbock said. Three other people were missing, two of them swept away by rivers. Floods and landslides prompted an emergency declaration in three Austrian regions, and a number of railways and roads remained blocked, the European Emergency Response Center said. However, with water levels receding, the situation was improving. Menace moves downstream . The Danube was threatening Slovakia too. Waters had reached flood stage in the capital, Bratislava, and were expected to rise for the next day or two. ""We expect the situation in Slovakia to become critical on Thursday, when the Slovakian portion of the River Danube is expected to peak,"" said Silvia Jancovicova, a spokeswoman for the Slovakian fire department. ""We are currently preparing anti-flood barriers, and planning for the possibility of evacuation of some areas in Bratislava."" No flood-related deaths had been reported there, she said. Also at risk was the southeastern Slovakian city of Kosice, where the mayor declared a flood emergency. The flooding follows rains in the region over the weekend that fell on ground already saturated by a wet spring.

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- The school buses usually rolled into the grounds of the Hawley School around 8:30 a.m., carrying dozens of elementary school children. But today, the grounds were empty of students, teachers and staff -- as were the six other public schools in this town where the unimaginable happened. The yellow buses were replaced with black vans with tinted windows carrying friends and family. They pulled up outside the town's only funeral home as Newtown buried the first of its slain youth. A steady stream of mourners strolled down Main Street. Dads in black trench coats held the hands of their wives, their boys dressed in coats and ties, their girls in dress pants. They walked, heads bowed, to the Honan Funeral Home, a white colonial house where people have helped bury Newtown's dead since 1903. They tried to ignore the chaotic scene outside: the black vans, police cars, and TV news satellite trucks. This was another new day in Newtown, the first weekday since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Sunday night's interfaith service was over. President Obama was back in Washington. Schools were closed. What can you say? How can you explain this heinous act on the nation's most innocent? Christmas presents, already wrapped and under the tree, will go unopened next week. Siblings will miss their brothers and sisters for the rest of their lives. And the very fabric of a quaint New England community has been altered. Forever. We have to do better ... Those were the words of the president as he spoke to the community and the nation. A refrain that's now become a mantra in town. A statement so powerful it evokes tears from moms, dads, grandparents who repeat it. And it's true. Twenty-six dead -- 20 children, all aged 6 and 7. It's unfathomable. And also so real, here. Every hour or so, a police car or ambulance or fire engine roars down Main Street with its sirens blaring. Residents shudder. Oh, no, what now? Teachers were heroes in the face of death . Reporters, their eyes swollen from shedding their own tears, struggle to ask questions. Residents understand. Newtown on Monday bid farewell to two 6-year-old boys: Jack Pinto, whose love of sports ran the gamut, but none so deep as football; and his classmate, Noah Pozner, whose family said he could get what he wanted just by batting his long eyelashes. It's just the beginning of a long healing process, a realization that the normalcy residents awoke to last Friday will never return. Many flocked to the Newtown General Store, a deli that has long served as a hub of community activity. Among its specialty sandwiches is The Sandy Hook, hot roast beef with bacon, melted cheddar and ranch dressing. Bob Jacobs, a father of four young children, brought two of his sons to the sandwich shop after paying their respects at Jack Pinto's funeral. Peace on this day, he said, was ""just having the kids come in the bed with you in the morning. ... That's when it's all kind of normal."" ""It's weird because you'll run into things that will remind you of before the tragedy happened and it feels like a normal day,"" he said. ""And then, you'll run into things that remind you of what happened."" Members of the news media are everywhere, as are police officers. The deli provided a respite from the madness. The tentacles of what happened touch everyone in the community. Jacobs' children don't attend Sandy Hook, but they're still directly affected. Principal's husband left with future that makes no sense . One of his boys is a close friend of Jack Pinto's brother. His 7-year-old daughter had dance class with three of the girls who were killed. He and his wife are part of a dinner club with parents of another slain child. Lauren Rousseau was teaching at Sandy Hook on Friday when she was killed. She'd also been a substitute at the Hawley School, which three of Jacobs' children attend. Two of his children opted to stay home from Monday's services. ""We're kind of taking it individually with each kid. ""As you can imagine, there's a lot of tears."" And hugs. Chaplains Ray and Suzanne Thompson came up from New York City, where they had been helping people struggling with the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. The Thompsons are members of the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team and have helped at other mass shootings, including the attempted killing of Rep. Gabby Giffords near Tucson, Arizona. They stopped in the deli for a quick bite to eat before hitting the pavement. ""The whole town is just heartbroken,"" said Suzanne Thompson, a retired nurse from Southern California. ""As you walk the streets, people are crying and hurt and sometimes they might feel alone. And it's nice to have someone come up alongside you and cry with you and hear your story and pray with you."" The most chilling stories, she said, are from parents and teachers who were at the Sandy Hook school last Friday. ""What stands out in my mind,"" she said, ""is just the impact that it's had on them and what they remember: the noises and the sounds and the smells. Those things are going to be burned in their minds."" The husband-and-wife team look for signs of distress. They talk with residents about the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder -- inability to sleep, flashbacks, loss of appetite, potential suicidal tendencies. They refer some to counseling and follow up with people to see how they're coping. At the deli, one resident looked at the woman behind the counter as he paid for his food. ""My kids are having trouble sleeping at night,"" he told her. She handed him three lollipops. Candles and tears: Portrait of a grieving town . A few blocks down Main Street, inside the town library, the sniffling voice of a grieving man could be heard coming from the stacks. ""It's just ... God!"" he screeched. Downstairs, in the children's section, Alana Bennison wept behind her desk. She's been the children's librarian for 15 years. She knew nearly every child killed. She's surrounded by thousands of books. But no amount of words, no amount of reading material, could prepare a town for such horror. ""They start here before they start school,"" she said, crying. ""Their families have been bringing them in here, most of them since they were little, to get books."" They had recently finished a gingerbread workshop. She has fielded hundreds of calls and e-mails from around the country, people wanting to help Newtown. She's not sure what to make of it all -- she's both touched and overwhelmed. It's only been three days. ""It's not just about this week; it's not just about the next few weeks. It's about going forward. We have a long road here, a very long road,"" she said. ""It will never be normal, but we need to start getting back into routines. They need to start going back to their schools, they need to start going back to the Cub Scouts and the dance lessons and karate and all the things that make up their lives."" School starts up again Tuesday for all Newtown students, except those at Sandy Hook. In a nearby reading area, a collie named Gracie sat as five youngsters gathered around. One read to her. The therapy dog was brought in, Bennison said, ""because everybody needs a little animal love."" Gracie is 7 years old, the age of four of the children killed at the school. When one of the boys learned of the dog's age, he jumped up and down with excitement. ""My sister is 7 years old,"" he squealed. A glimpse into normalcy -- for just a brief moment -- in a town where innocence has been stolen.

"(CNN) -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard is expected to secure a major currency conversion deal with her nation's number one trading partner as she begins a six-day visit to China Friday. The deal has ramifications beyond Beijing-Canberra ties as a step towards full convertibility of the yuan on international markets, denting the primacy of the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency of choice. Currently, Chinese and Australian companies must use the U.S. dollar as an intermediary for trade. The Australian leader also faces the task of assuring China that her nation's growing defense agreements with the U.S. pose no threat to Beijing. ""I don't view us as being in a position where the strong and growing relationship we have with China is somehow in contest, or in contrast, to the relationship we have with the United States of America,"" Gillard said Thursday at a Foreign Correspondents lunch in Sydney, ahead of her departure. Leading what she called the ""most senior Australian political delegation"" ever to visit China, Prime Minister Gillard will also be amongst the first western leaders to meet China's new President Xi Jinping. The Australian delegation includes the Foreign Minister, Bob Carr, Trade Minister Craig Emerson and Financial Services Minister Bill Shorten. ""The timing of this visit so soon after the new leadership has entered office is deliberate and reflects the importance of our rapidly evolving relationship with China and our high-level political oversight of that relationship,"" Prime Minister Gillard said. The visit is primarily aimed at furthering the Australian governments ambition for greater engagement with Asia -- and China in particular -- as outlined in a major policy paper released in October. ""Australia in the Asia Century"" acknowledged Australia's economic prosperity was tied Asia and it detailed a set of objectives to be achieved in order for Australia to boost its wealth by taking advantage of the rise of a massive Asian middle class. Australia's dependence on China as it marches toward global economic dominance has been clear for many years now. In 2011-12, China was again Australia's largest two-way trading partner for goods and services, with trade topping $128 billion. China accounts for 14.7% of the total trade of goods and services and takes one quarter of Australian exports, much of it in raw materials. Significant Australian exports of coal and liquid gas are used to power Chinese industry, but Australian suppliers are facing increasing pressure from U.S. and Russian rivals. ""It's a competitive world and you're right, the amount of competition in the energy sector is getting stronger and stronger and more and more acute,"" she said. ""I am very confident that we can be very good at what we do. I think we're very good now and we are always going to have to look for the innovations that make us an even better quality supplier,"" she added. Under the currency deal that Prime Minister Gillard is expected to announce whilst in Shanghai, the Australian dollar would become directly convertible to Chinese yuan, overcoming the need to first convert to U.S. dollars. This would remove expensive exchange rate issues, cutting the cost to Australians of doing business in China, though the Prime Minister remained coy when asked to confirm the deal. ""You are going to have to wait until I'm in Shanghai,"" she told the Foreign Correspondents luncheon. With the Chinese economy expected to grow at about 8% this year, the currency deal would be an important and much needed political bonus for the struggling Gillard government in an election year. She did however warn that the Australian dollar was expected to remain high due to Chinese demand and the perception that Australia is a safe currency haven. ""Australian dollar to U.S. dollar exchanges are now estimated to be the fifth highest traded currencies in the world,"" she said. Gillard will also take the stage at the Bo'ao Forum for Asia on Hainan Island where the world's business leaders and economic thinkers will gather to hear from China's senior policy makers. Later, in Beijing, she will meet with President Xi Jinping, to discuss what she termed Australia's position as an ""energy superpower,"" as well as regional defense and security issues. Australia's decision to permit U.S. marines to be stationed on its soil as part of Washington's refocus on the Asia Pacific has upset Beijing. Ahead of the 16th annual Australia-China Defence Strategic Dialogue later this year and a Chinese navy ship visit for the International Fleet Review, the Australian government is also working on agreements to allow U.S. naval and aircraft access to Australia. But Prime Minister Gillard there is no competition between the United States and China for Australia's attention and allegiance. ""We will continue to do what we've done for some period of time - to attend to our friendship and alliance with the United States while growing our friendship with China,"" she added. Tension resulting from North Korea's threat to launch missile attacks against U.S. allies in its neighborhood and even against the U.S. mainland also is expected to be raised. Foreign Minister Bob Carr told ABC television that Australia will seek information from the Chinese leadership. ""We will raise with China our concerns that if the provocative and bellicose behavior of North Korea continues, then it will simply result in rising tensions in north-east Asia and put Japan and South Korea in a position where they will pay more attention to their security,"" he said. ""China has a keen interest in seeing that the provocative behavior by North Korea comes to an end."" Regardless of pressing international geo-politics, domestic issues are never far away. Although meeting President Xi is expected to bolster Prime Minister Gillard's image at home where she has been criticized for being uncomfortable on the world stage and disinterested in international affairs, her political opposition have taken aim. READ MORE: Party keeps faith with Gillard but will Australia's voters? Whilst welcoming the prospect of a currency conversion deal, the opposition has reiterated concern over the government's threatened crackdown on skilled worker visas, which Prime Minister Gillard claims is being abused. She said the visa category was delivering jobs that could go to Australians, to foreign workers, leaving supporters and critics alike condemning her for buying into a divisive and long running race debate. On the eve of her departure for China, the opposition coalition leader, Tony Abbott said that the Prime Minister is ""very interested in the Asia century when she's traveling to Asia, but when it comes to skilled migration, a totally different story.""","Australian PM Julia Gillard begins six-day visit to China Friday .

"(CNN) -- Forget Angry Birds. There's a new iPhone application that provides hours of entertainment. Released last week, iSpeech Obama allows you to type in any phrase you want and the president's voice will repeat it back to you. I played around with the app and couldn't help but have some ego-stroking fun: ""Anne, what an honor to meet you. I love your work."" No matter what you think of Obama's performance lately, you can't help but enjoy the president's thoughtful baritone speaking directly to you and saying exactly what you want to hear. With so many pundits and politicians weighing in on what Obama should be saying about how to get our country back on track, this should be a popular application. Even though the president can't seem to find his fighting words of 2008, you can visit the iTunes store for a free download that will deliver you back to the days when Obama fought for Main Street. If I could have the president say anything, I'd have him say what a growing chorus of commentators have been urging for months now, something like, ""Our No. 1 priority is jobs, and I have a bold, detailed plan to rebuild our schools and infrastructure, revive manufacturing and spur our nation's green industrial revolution."" Let's hope Obama will lay out this big vision for job creation in his post-Labor Day speech, going further than his small bore approach of late. And while I'm putting words in his mouth, I'd also have Obama say, ""It's time to raise the minimum wage."" It may sound surprising, but it's exactly what our economy needs. On the campaign trail, Obama called for raising the minimum wage to $9.50 by 2011; now is the time deliver on that pledge. Raising the minimum wage would not only help working families, it also would help power the economic recovery. As the economy has sputtered, wages have stagnated, and even folks with jobs are having trouble meeting their families' basic needs. Accounting for inflation, weekly wages have actually fallen by 1.3 percent in the past eight months, and the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending, which makes up 70 percent of the economy, dropped in June for the first time in nearly two years -- both deeply worrying economic indicators. Raising the minimum wage puts a little more money in pockets of the lowest-paid workers, who have little choice but to spend that additional income immediately, helping restore the consumer spending that businesses need to grow. Preliminary estimates suggest that restoring the minimum wage to $10 per hour by 2014 could generate as many as 160,000 new jobs. And not only does raising the wage floor help workers making minimum wage, it also boosts pay scales across the whole lower end of our economy. Unfortunately, low-wage work is becoming the livelihood of an ever-growing number of workers. A new analysis by the National Employment Law Project finds that while the majority of jobs lost during and after the recession were in mid-wage occupations, roughly three-quarters of jobs added since job growth resumed are low-wage. And while the bastion of low-paid workers is growing, their wages are declining: workers in lower-wage occupations (with median wages under $13.52) have seen a 2.3 percent decline in real wages since the recession began. While wages and salaries are now the lowest share of GDP since 1955, corporate profits are the largest share of GDP since 1950. According to research by Andrew Sum at Northeastern University, wages and salaries accounted for just 1 percent of economic growth in the first 18 months after the recession ended, while corporate profits accounted for an unprecedented 88 percent of economic growth. Put quite simply, working people have been getting the shaft. Not only would a new push to raise the minimum wage help America's economy and working families -- it would help Obama regain populist momentum. Raising the minimum wage is particularly popular with the public, consistently winning support from more than two-thirds of the public. Opponents are likely to be put on the defensive, struggling to explain why they oppose a modest raise for Main Street as Wall Street enjoys record profits. They will also resurrect the tired old canard that raising the minimum wage leads to job loss, but that theory was first shot to pieces in the 1990s by Alan Krueger, Obama's nominee to head the Council of Economic Advisers, when he and economist David Card published a groundbreaking study finding that raising the minimum wage boosts incomes of low-paid workers without reducing employment. Nearly two decades of rigorous academic research has confirmed these findings. With so many Americans struggling, we need the president to raise his voice and find some fighting words. It's time for President Obama to say -- once again -- that now is the time to raise the minimum wage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anne Thompson.","Anne Thompson: A new phone app allows you to get Obama to say anything in his rich baritone .

"(CNN) -- The longtime companion of notorious fugitive James ""Whitey"" Bulger has pleaded guilty to several charges related to her infamous 16-year run from authorities with her alleged mobster boyfriend. Catherine Greig entered the guilty plea Wednesday to one charge of conspiracy to harbor a fugitive and two counts of identity theft, according to federal court spokesman Steve York. ""In early 1995, I agreed to join Bulger and travel with Bulger during his flight from law enforcement. From January 1995 through June 22. 2011, I also agreed with others, including Bulger, to harbor and conceal him from law enforcement,"" Greig said in court documents. Bulger, 82, has previously pleaded not guilty to all charges against him, including 19 murder charges. U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz of Massachusetts said Greig is ""no victim"" and her plea was ""no sweetheart deal."" ""There was no deal -- certainly no sweetheart deal,"" Ortiz said. ""I want the record to stand that at no time we compromised our ability to make a sentencing recommendation. The chapter has not closed on this matter on this case. ""We think that bringing this matter swiftly to a conviction is a fair and just result. We can focus on an ongoing investigation now. We can focus on the trial of Mr. Bulger. The taxpayers don't want to see a trail that's not necessary to be had, and I think this is a very appropriate conclusion,"" Ortiz said. Bulger, who is being held without bail, was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. He evaded law enforcement for 16 years before he and Greig were arrested in June 2011 in Santa Monica. The couple had, for several years, hid in plain sight in the palm-tree-lined, oceanside city near Los Angeles in a three-story building named Princess Eugenia. Bulger was arrested after he was lured out of his apartment with an FBI ruse: He received a phone call and was told his lock box had been broken into in the basement parking lot area of his apartment building. When Bulger went down to check it out, FBI agents arrested him. Neighbors said the couple was quiet. A manager of a restaurant near their home recalled how the alleged gangster and his girlfriend liked the privacy of a far corner table and once worked up a $192 bill, plus tip, for a steak and lobster dinner, accompanied by foie gras, vodka highballs and chardonnay. But before settling into anonymity, Bulger was once one of the FBI's Top 10 most wanted fugitives. His alleged barbarity as an Irish-American mobster in Boston is said to have inspired the Jack Nicholson character in Martin Scorsese's 2006 film ""The Departed."" Dick Lehr, who wrote a book about Bulger, described him as a cold-blooded killer whose gang went to lengths to avoid detection. ""When they killed someone -- this is pre-DNA -- they pulled the teeth out, cut the fingers off, tried to make it so the victims, if they were discovered from their graves, couldn't be identified. There's just no bottom. It doesn't get much uglier than someone like Whitey Bulger,"" Lehr said. The FBI employed many methods to capture Bulger, including offering a $2 million reward. In 2011, the agency began airing a 30-second public service announcement aimed at getting Bulger. The agency bought about 350 ad spots in 14 U.S. cities. The ad focused on Greig, then 60, and targeted female viewers around the same age. It described her as loving dogs and other animals and frequenting beauty salons. It said she had worked as a dental hygienist, likes to maintain her teeth, and had had multiple plastic surgeries. Bulger's brother, William Bulger, is a former president of the University of Massachusetts and a state Senate leader. He was forced to step down from his university job after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, now a Republican presidential candidate, accused him of being evasive during congressional testimony about the whereabouts of his brother. Greig could face a five-year sentence for each count, according to court documents. CNN's Julia Talanova contributed to this report.","NEW: ""There was no deal -- certainly no sweetheart deal,"" prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified bacterial and fungal growth in unopened vials of a steroid injection from a Tennessee pharmacy under investigation for links to reported infections. Main Street Family Pharmacy of Newbern, Tennessee, issued a voluntary recall nationwide of all lots of sterile products that the pharmacy compounds on May 28. Products with a use by date on or before November 20, 2013, are subject to the recall. What is a compounding pharmacy? The steroid in question is preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. Samples from two separate batches were found to have microbial growth in them, the FDA said. ""At this point in FDA's investigation, the sterility of all sterile products produced by Main Street is of significant concern and the products should not be used,"" the FDA said. As of Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 24 cases of infection from four states -- Arkansas, Florida, Illinois and North Carolina. Most of these people developed skin and soft tissue infections after receiving the intramuscular injection of the steroid. The FDA is not aware of any cases of meningitis linked to the steroid injections from the Main Street Family Pharmacy. A fungal meningitis outbreak last year was linked to methylprednisolone acetate from a compounding pharmacy in Massachusetts. Other samples of this steroid and other products from Main Street are still being evaluated, the FDA said. The CDC is working with the FDA to identify which fungus and bacteria were detected in the vials. The Tennessee Department of Health said May 24 that the pharmacy ""is currently on probation as a result of a recent inspection."" The Tennessee Board of Pharmacy licensed the compounding pharmacy in 1985, the state health agency said. It was licensed as a manufacturer/wholesaler/distributor in 2010. ""Health officials believe, in reviewing preliminary information about when the material could have been appropriately used, there is not an ongoing risk to those now needing treatments,"" the Tennessee health agency said. Methylprednisolone acetate is an injectable form of a popular steroid medication and is used to treat inflammation throughout the body. It's most commonly used to treat arthritic joint pain but can also be used for other conditions such as allergic reactions, sports-related injuries, immune system disorders, certain cancers and other types of inflammatory diseases.

"(CNN) -- In the ghettos of the Niger Delta, one woman is on a mission to bring glamor to the region while at the same time educating and inspiring promising young talent from the area. Caterina Bortolussi has always been interested in fashion. But what started as the dream of a young girl from a small town outside of Venice, Italy, has become a reality years later in the ghettos of Port Harcourt in the south of Nigeria. In December 2010, Bortolussi started her fashion label Kinabuti. With designs inspired by Nigeria, reflecting the vibrant colors and traditions of Africa, Bortolussi decided on an ethical twist to her organization. She wanted to use fashion as an instrument for change in the region. ""I thought, 'Why can't we use fashion as a vehicle to make a difference?' We should lead by example,"" says Bortolussi. ""We should do something that will make a difference and inspire other people. That is what I want to do with Kinabuti: positive action."" Green is this season's color at Nigeria Fashion Week . The label's ethos is to engage with the local community as well as provide opportunities and training to the people who need it most, says Bortolussi. She held casting sessions in various local communities, choosing 21 young girls aged 16 to 25. With no prior experience in modeling, they underwent training at ""Buti Camp"" in professional skills such as make up and hairstyling, runway walking, posing and other fundamental tricks of the trade. These women became the ""Kinabuti girls"" and work with the label to promote and model the designs. Their role also gives them the opportunity to meet people, work with other designers and learn skills to take with them in the future. Bortolussi says: ""I tell them, 'Not all of you will become a top model. Be realistic. Learn the most you can.' ""It's a job that we enable them to explore themselves. Their mindset is changing. This [Lagos] is a city with 18 million people -- one of the biggest cities in the world. And now they are learning that if they work hard they can achieve anything."" And Bortolussi's campaign of inspiration seems to be working. Twenty-year-old Abigail Okoye stumbled across Kinabuti by accident but says it has changed her life forever. She says: ""I was just walking down the road and someone told me I looked like a model and asked me to go to the casting that was going on. So I went. ""It has allowed me to learn so many things. I'm meeting new people and I can achieve more in life ... Apart from being a model, which is my dream, I also want to go into fashion designing because I love colors. It's a beautiful profession."" Another young model from the region, Ini Godwin, was an unqualified teacher in a small local school. Like many others in the Port Harcourt ghettos, life before Kinabuti was a constant struggle for her family. Why African designers are finally in the fashion spotlight . She says: ""You have to fight for your living ... I lived with my parents, my brothers, my sisters, and we tried to make ends meet. With Kinabuti, it was an experience that added something different and brought a new feeling to me. ""It's not everyday in life that we have the opportunity to do what we want to do ... Being part of Kinabuti has showed me that I can do things. It made me believe in myself. Having that in my head ... has been the most exciting part of this experience so far."" Bortolussi says that one year in, the journey has, at times, been difficult. ""Nigeria is such a hard country. It is very real,"" says Bortolussi. ""There are some very creative designers but no distribution. Production is challenging, and there is no light, no electricity. All the time we are running generators. It makes everything expensive and hard to run a business. It's very challenging."" These obstacles were captured by Swedish filmmaker Marcus Werner Hed, who directed a documentary about Kinabuti called ""In our Ghetto."" The film follows the girls over three weeks providing an insight into the lives of the Kinabuti models as they prepared for the launch of the label. Werner Hed admires the message that Bortolussi is trying to send to the community. ""I was mostly impressed with the amount of self-confidence that Caterina's project brings to these girls,"" he says. The Namibian women who dress like Victorians . ""[Port Harcourt is] quite a hard and depressing place, but incredible and vibrant as well. It's a city that has overgrown its infrastructure and it's not got the amenities it needs to function as a city,"" he adds. Regeneration is part of Bortolussi's larger and rather ambitious plan for the region. As well as continuing with the brand and educational elements, she wants to try different types of training. ""Our focus is on the community,"" she says. ""What we want to do for next year is organize training for tailors in skills like draping, dress-making, making patterns and creating new fabrics. ""We will show the participants the same way we got the models and I know they will be able to use those skills and get jobs straight away."" Bortolussi believes Nigerians need to embrace products made in Nigeria, rather than imported items. ""We need to create the capacity for manufacturing and development,"" she says. ""It will take time and it is not a short-term project. But fashion is my passion so I want to make it an industry.""","Italian designer Caterina Bortolussi has started an ethical fashion label in Nigeria .

"(CNN) -- A British fugitive wanted for fleeing his 2009 trial on armed robbery charges was back in custody Sunday after a dramatic raid on a villa in southern Spain, British authorities announced Sunday. Spanish police video of the raid shows Andrew Moran attempting to jump a poolside wall to escape officers during the Friday afternoon raid in Alicante, on the Mediterranean coast. Moran had been relaxing by the pool before the raid, Britain's Serious Organised Crime Agency said. Moran, 31, had been convicted in absentia of conspiracy to commit armed robbery for the 2005 holdup of a Royal Mail vehicle. A security guard was injured, and Moran and an accomplice got away with 25,000 pounds ($38,000), the agency said. Moran was standing trial in Burnley, in northwestern England, in February 2009 when he attacked four security guards, vaulted out of the dock and escaped. He lived in Spain under a series of false identities, ""frequently changing his appearance,"" Matt Burton, the organized crime agency's head of investigations, said in a statement announcing his capture. Moran is scheduled to appear before a judge in Madrid to face an extradition request on Monday, the statement said. He had escaped an earlier arrest attempt, in November, by ramming police cars and driving off the wrong way down a highway. His accomplice, Stephen Devalda, was arrested in Spain in 2011 in a joint operation between Spanish and British authorities and has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison.","Andrew Moran fled his 2009 robbery trial, police say .

"(CNN) -- A top American envoy was summoned by Pakistan's new government to protest a U.S. drone strike that killed at least six militants in the volatile North Waziristan province, the Pakistan government said Saturday. U.S. charge d'affaires Richard Hoagland was summoned Friday at the order of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and given a letter of protest, the government said. ""Pakistan strongly condemns the drone strikes which are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes was emphasized,"" it said in a written statement. Sharif completes long journey back to power . Drone strikes in the tribal regions bordering Afghanistan have drawn heated opposition in Pakistan because of civilian casualties. ""Obviously this is an issue that will be taken up at a higher political level with the American authorities,"" Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan's national security adviser, told reporters Saturday. The issue of drone strikes is expected to be on the top of the agenda when U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visits Pakistan later this month, he said. The summoning of Hoagland came just two days after Sharif demanded in his inaugural address the U.S. stop its drone strikes. He reiterated the demand Saturday. ""We have protested many a time. This is simply unacceptable,"" Sharif said during a meeting with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle, according to Pakistan state news. Sources: Top militant killed in drone strike . But U.S. President Barack Obama defended the use of drone strikes last month, stopping short of directly commenting on the strikes in Pakistan. Drone strikes were legal, Obama said, because the United States ""is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban and their associated forces."" Friday's drone strike follows a similar strike nearly two weeks ago that killed the Pakistan Taliban's second-in-command, Wali-Ur Rehman Mehsud. Rehman was wanted by the United States on suspicion of being involved in the December 2009 suicide bomb attack that killed seven CIA employees at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan, according to a publication by the U.S. National Counterrorism Center. The drone strikes have only served to further roil U.S.-Pakistan relations, which flared following a 2011 raid by U.S. commandos on a compound in Abbottabad that ended with the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.","U.S. charge d'affaires Richard Hoagland is summoned, Pakistan government says .

"Miami (CNN) -- For politicians seeking public office, a stop at the iconic Cafe Versailles is a must. This Little Havana institution has become a symbol of the strength of the Hispanic vote. Here, Cuban exiles have turned their conservative stance against the Castro regime into a political force to be reckoned with in U.S. politics. ""It forces politicians to learn Spanish,"" said journalist Julio Cesar Camacho, ""even if it's a few words."" During a Republican debate last week, Rep. Michele Bachmann mentioned her visit to Versailles as she tried to establish a rapport with Hispanic voters. It was one of the first references to Versailles in the nascent presidential campaign season, but it likely won't be the last. According to the 2010 census, the Latino community is the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials estimates that, out of more than 50 million Hispanics in the United States, 24 million will be eligible to vote next year. In South Florida, many of those voters are Latinos who are longtime residents of the region, but have been hoping to return to their countries of origin once the political and economic situation of the region changed, Florida International University Professor Daniel Alvarez said. As time goes on, those families are becoming increasingly active in politics -- taking a page from the Cuban-American political playbook, though not necessarily following their political views. In Miami, Alvarez said, 60% of non-Cuban Hispanics are Democrats. Republican activist Fabio Andrade agrees. The Colombian-American, who chaired John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign in Miami, said new voters of Colombian descent are registering Democrats at a 2-to-1 ratio. The tea party is part of the reason, he said. ""Some of the tea party views are too radical for Hispanics,"" he said. That sentiment is echoed by Oswaldo Munoz, the publisher of El Venezolano newspaper. ""The tea party message is not one Hispanics want to hear, nor do we want to be the target of some of the ideas they propose,"" Munoz said. According to Alvarez, those ideas revolve around one issue that crosses country loyalties: immigration. ""Argentines, Colombians, Nicaraguans ... they all still identify themselves as immigrants, and the status of the immigrant is in peril right now due to the right-leaning tendencies in the country,"" he said. But conservative Hispanic politicians fared very well in the last election -- some of them buoyed by the support of tea party loyalists. Raul Labrador, now a congressman from Idaho, was a voice for the tea party during the debt ceiling debate. In New Mexico, Susana Martinez became the first Latina governor in the U.S. with the support of Sarah Palin and tea party activists. In a recent interview, Martinez told CNN the tea party has fiscal policies that are good for the country. ""I think the tea party makes us think different and gives us more options from where to choose when it comes to electing candidates,"" Martinez said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also rode the tea party wave that swept Republicans into Congress last year. But he has been criticized for his stance against illegal immigration, and Alvarez said he's seen Rubio trying to distance himself from the tea party. Next year's elections will be a key indicator of whether tea party policies will drive Latino voters into Democrats' arms for years to come, Alvarez said. But Democrats in South Florida aren't claiming victory just yet. Joe Garcia, a Cuban-American Democrat who lost a congressional bid last year, said conservative Cubans are still the dominant force in South Florida, and they will continue to be for the foreseeable future.","In a Republican debate, Rep.

"(Lonely Planet) -- Small is beautiful. If you're skeptical, lo and behold Kaua'i, the diminutive doyenne among the major Hawaiian Islands. Here, no town surpasses 10,000 people. By law no building is taller than a coconut tree. The spotlight shines not on the manmade, but on nature's great outdoors. Be it emerald valleys overlooking the North Shore or turquoise waters lapping 50 miles of ivory sand along the South Shore, Kauaʻi's epic landscape pops with a Technicolor punch that's all natural. The following (in no particular order) are 10 of our top recommendations for an unforgettable Kauaʻi experience. Lonely Planet: Hawaii for beach haters . 1. Best beach . Consistently named as one of Hawaii's best beaches, Hanalei Bay comprises four beaches and each one has its charms to satisfy everyone. A serene slice of paradise with modern conveniences, Hanalei Beach Park Pavilion is likely to hit most of what's on that beach day checklist. Walk or run the two-mile stretch of sugary sand, pack a picnic lunch or adopt a laissez-faire 'tude and practice the art of doing nothing. The 'pavilion' acts as a home base for the day if some in your group can't resist wandering off for a fruit-stand smoothie at Hanalei Taro & Juice Company or a stand-up paddle surfing lesson. 2. Best botanical wonder . It's clear why Kaua'i is nicknamed the 'Garden Isle.' Who could possibly imagine so many incarnations of green? In Po'ipu, Allerton Garden is the nature-made equivalent of a man-made palace, featuring living 'rooms' with foliage borders accented with waterfalls, pools, fountains and statues. The adjacent McBryde Garden is vast and less manicured, holding the largest collection of native Hawaiian flora in existence. In Ha'ena, don't miss the most-Hawaiian garden of the three, Limahuli Garden, the only non-irrigated location (no need, as the North Shore has rain to spare!). 3. Best coastal hike . Ancient lithified sand dunes. If that sounds too academic, wait till you see them up close. Maha'ulepu is Kaua'i's last accessible undeveloped coastline, where the effects of 5 million years are obvious. From your perch on the cliffs, peer down at the pounding surf and rock-strewn inlets, where monk seals occasionally haul themselves out to rest. Soon you'll reach Maha'ulepu Beach, where a pristine swath of velvety sand meets scattered rocks and relentless waves. Raw, rugged and remote, Maha'ulepu is utterly memorable. It's a wonderful place to escape the resort beaches and public parks, but tread lightly on this sacred sanctuary. 4. Best native forest . Soggy, muddy and misty, the Alaka'i Swamp might not sound appealing, but this otherworldly rainforest is an unforgettable haven for native plants and rare birds. At 4000 to 4500 ft in elevation, Alaka'i is not actually a swamp but rather a rainforest bog, filled with ferns, moss-covered tree trunks and vividly blooming 'ohia lehua. Before the early 1990s, only scientists, intrepid hikers and pig hunters braved the thicket of brush and deep murk. Since then, a wooden boardwalk has made Alaka'i more accessible while it also protects the fragile terrain. Be prepared for sun, rain, hundreds of steps and, if the clouds refrain themselves, an awesome view. 5. Best kid pleaser . One kid wants to snorkel, another lives to rollerblade, and the third wants simply to build sand castles all afternoon. Sounds daunting. But at Lydgate Beach Park in Wailua, it's a cinch to satisfy 'em all. The lifeguard-staffed beach is protected within a stone breakwater that forms two calm, shallow lagoons, ideal for munchkin snorkelers or learn-to-swimmers. Near the water, two giant playgrounds capture the imagination, with unique wooden mazes and bridges, kid-made ceramic mosaics, and classic swings and slides. Along the sand, there's a paved path, safe for pedestrians, cyclists, rollerbladers and dogs on leashes. Bring fixings for grilling, kick back and marvel that this wonderful place won't cost you a cent. Lonely Planet: Maui for foodies . 6. Best fitness challenge . A siren song of sorts, the Na Pali Coast is inaccessible to vehicles and can be seen only by boat, helicopter or hike. That's why it draws some of the fittest and strongest from around the world, who've been lured by the notoriety of mastering this challenging stretch at ocean level. If you're fit enough to be mistaken for a superhero, a kayak tour around the Na Pali Coast could be your cup of tea (or energy drink). The tour is offered only from May to September, so if you're here during that time frame -- and if triathlons, marathons and the like are part of your more-than-once-a-year routine -- then this might be for you. Added bonus? The two-hour beach lunch break. 7. Best nightlife . Local artists on-island joined up to dominate the main street real estate when the mom-and-pop businesses of the historic West Side town of Hanapepe were dropping like flies. Now every Friday is the Hanapepe Art Walk as galleries are open late and the strip is awash in looky-loos with a hankering for art. Once dubbed the 'Biggest Little Town on Kauaʻi,' Hanapepe's rep has evolved in recent years and it's now better known as an 'art central' of sorts. Peruse the galleries housing everything from kitsch Hawaiiana to Japanese-inspired watercolors, or locally-inspired interpretations of cubist, impressionist and expressionistic movements. 8. Best scenic drive . Driving northwards from Kalihiwai, you'll emerge from a canopy of trees that rise from an undulating landscape, through a wild stretch slicing past a jungle-like mass over the river, beside the ocean. After the vine-laden Kalihiwai Bridge, you'll see patches of verdant fields where horses graze under tropical fruit-bearing trees, and teasing views here and there that let you just snatch glimpses of the Pacific. Continue onward to Hanalei, passing first its famous historic bridge, then the six one-way bridges beyond (follow local courtesy and allow eight cars to pass first). Explore for a bit at the wet caves or the inspired Limahuli Garden, winding up your afternoon at far-flung Keʻe Beach -- the ultimate sunset perch. 9. Best bargain meal . Big-name chefs often serve up tuna tartare. But locals consider such fancy foods as overpriced renditions of Hawaiian-style ʻahi poke, chunks of succulent raw tuna, seasoned typically with soy sauce, sesame oil, green onion, sea salt, ogo (seaweed) and inamona (ground-roasted kukui). Traditionally, Hawaiians used only the latter three ingredients, but as different immigrants arrived with their own staple seasonings, recipes evolved into today's tastebud-tangling varieties. Poke is an everyday dish, purchased at deli counters and places like the South Shore's Koloa Fish Market. Typically under US$12 per pound, take-out poke makes a first-rate meal on the run. 10. Best hike to remember . A vertiginous tease, the hike from Keʻe Beach to Hanakapiʻai Falls can elicit awe, anticipation and impatience. But after you've climbed energetically around each rising, undulating curve, it delivers. You arrive at one of the most captivating sights the North Shore has to offer. At 2 miles in, Hanakapiʻai Beach is the first stop on the 11-mile Kalalau Trail. You'll have to hike through a seemingly overgrown forest dense with everything from bamboo to wild orchids to reach the 100ft Hanakapiʻia Falls, so try to follow the stream and listen for the sound of rushing water. Those with hiking boots, agile feet and avid quadriceps will probably hike this roundtrip in four hours. Word to the wise: be generous with mosquito repellent, sunblock and wear a swimsuit underneath. Pack a light snack, camera and water bottle.

"Orlando (CNN) -- While tickets to the Casey Anthony trial may be some of the hottest items in Orlando right now, at least 17 people are there because they have to be -- the jurors. Karen Levey, a court spokeswoman, talks to HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell about what life is like for the men and women serving on the jury and as alternates. CNN: Do jurors get to see their families? Levey: Sunday afternoons, the jurors have an opportunity to meet with their families and they are private visits. They could be children, moms. It could be grandparents. It could be anybody meeting. CNN: Are they ever alone? Levey: The deputies are with them. Orange County Sheriff's Office is responsible for court security and they're there with them 24 hours a day, but again you have to trust the jurors to a certain point in any case. CNN: Have there been any complaints from the jurors so far? Levey: (Orange County Chief Judge Belvin) Perry is very mindful of the fact that these people have been away from home for five weeks. They're in hotels. They're not living their normal life. So he's pushing the case along. As far as we know, the jurors are very happy. We've had no complaints. We haven't lost a juror. I mean it's really going well. CNN: Do they have access to the Internet? Levey: The jurors have a common room that they can socialize in together and in that room there are some computers. And on those computers, jurors are allowed to pay their bills, order prescriptions, things like that. But it's all under the supervision of a court deputy. CNN: How about TV? Levey: They do (have access to television) -- limited stations -- everything from like TNT to ESPN they can watch. Shows that normally have news are not authorized by the court. CNN: How much is the jury costing the state? Levey: That $361,000 was an estimate. It's an estimate of jury sequestration costs and only jury sequestration costs. ...

"(CNN) -- At 81, China Machado is probably the world's oldest signed model. Just last month, the grandmother of two inked a contract with IMG models, the agency that represents Amazons such as Gisele, Kate Moss and Lily Cole. Already this year, Shanghai-born Machado has bagged the front cover of New York Magazine. ""Can you imagine?"" she laughs over the phone from New York. ""You know, I never dreamt this in my whole life!"" She also features in luxury store Barney's Fall ad campaign, styled by former Vogue Paris editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld, alongside the likes of Naomi Campbell and Crystal Renn. In the past few weeks, she shot a fashion spread for Vogue -- ""Italian ... or Spanish Vogue, I can't remember"" -- with photographer Bruce Weber, which will feature in the coming months. ""(It's) of me -- with all these 20-year-olds he always photographs,"" she says. Not that she's phased -- breaking the mould is nothing new for Machado. Machado had started modelling in Paris in 1954 for Givenchy and Balenciaga and claims to have been the highest paid catwalk model of her time. Her big break came in 1958. Oleg Cassini, who would later become known for designing First Lady Jackie Kennedy's state wardrobe in the 1960s, spotted Machado in Paris and offered her a contract to come to New York to model one of his collections. The rest is history. ""The day I arrived I met Diana Vreeland (legendary fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue) and she introduced me to (Richard) Avedon,"" remembers Machado. She became Avedon's muse, working with him exclusively for three years -- and in 1959, Machado was the first non-Caucasian model to feature on the cover of a fashion magazine, gracing the front of Harper's Bazaar in an image shot by legendary photographer Richard Avedon. It was the cover that almost wasn't, although Machado didn't know that at the time. Race and fashion: Still an issue? Years later, Avedon told her that the magazine's publisher at the time, Robert F. MacLeod said to him, ""Listen, we can't publish these pictures. The girl is not white."" Avedon was due to renew his contract with the magazine, and said he wouldn't sign unless they published his photographs of Machado. She says: ""(Avedon) had sort of blackmailed them into putting these pictures into the magazine."" Machado says she probably reached the height of her fame as a model in 1960. ""I had, you know, tons of write-ups on me as being the most famous model ever, on the runway. ""Every advert that came out (featuring Machado), it would say stupidly 'The Great China' on it. I felt like ... a circus!"" Machado says that her childhood in China -- when she was 16, she and members of her family fled Shanghai during WWII -- had made her ""such a practical person"" and she found modelling ""frivolous."" So Machado moved behind the camera. She took over as fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar in the early 60s when Diana Vreeland left. ""They took me as an offbeat character,"" she recalls, but she stayed for 11 years, mainly working with Avedon. In the late 1980s, she was instrumental in the launch of Lear's Magazine -- ""a magazine for women over 45,"" she says -- at a time when magazines didn't talk to that readership. ""We were way ahead of our time,"" says Machado. ""We were 21 years ago."" The magazine won awards and built a readership, but folded after six years, the victim of an unclear vision, according to the New York Times. Machado's current new beginning started a couple of years ago when her daughter brought the then creative director of U.S. fashion magazine, Dennis Freedman over for dinner. ""After dinner he said to me, 'I'm going to do 20 pages on you.' And I thought, 'This guy is nuts! I haven't been photographed in 20 years. ""And since then, every month, I'm in some magazine. It's crazy,"" she said. How a small-town girl became China's first supermodel . Ivan Bart, head of IMG Models, who has overseen Machado joining the agency, says that despite her age her appeal is obvious. ""First of all, she's legendary,"" he says, adding that she's ""this amazing woman who has given so much to the fashion industry ... and also, oh, by the way, she happens to be in her 80s. ""How inspirational is that for any woman of any age?"" Among other things, he'd love to put her on the runway -- where she started over half a century ago. ""Oh my god, how funny, how funny, how funny!"" she chuckles. ""Well, I'm a great dancer so I'm sure I'm not so worried about going on a runway."" But, always practical, Machado says she'd like, perhaps to be a spokesperson of some kind. She is, she claims, one of the few people who know the history of fashion, perhaps because she's lived it. ""We're signing up for something that might be a little unusual,"" she says, ""for someone who might be interested in seeing that a woman can be active until this age and, you know, not look so bad without plastic surgery.""","81-year-old grandmother signs to agency that also represents supermodels including Gisele .

"(CNN) -- A pop star wife, an estimated annual salary of $46 million and the most iconic player of this generation -- but to those who know the ""real"" David Beckham, he is just a ""normal guy"" and a ""devoted dad"". When Beckham announced his decision to retire from football Thursday, there was one man who had already anticipated such an event. Paul Clement, the assistant manager of Paris Saint-Germain, became a close confidante of his compatriot Beckham following the midfielder's arrival in the French capital last January. Nights in his exclusive suite at Le Bristol hotel were luxurious, but the distance between the 38-year-old and the rest of his family is believed to be one of the key factors in his decision to retire. While his former Spice Girl wife, Victoria, remained at home with children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper, Beckham spent time talking through his troubles to a man with a sympathetic ear. ""The impression from the very first time we met was that he was a devoted dad,"" Clement told CNN. ""He was very hands-on with the kids and, talking to people who knew him, I knew he wanted to be involved. ""I think that being away from his family, them being in London and him being in Paris, was difficult for him. ""We used to talk about our kids all the time and he asked me questions and we chatted about schooling and what they were up to. ""He missed them and I think that was a huge part of his decision to call it a day. I just had a feeling he might retire."" In an exclusive interview with CNN last month, Beckham spoke of the difficulty of being away from his family. ""That's the sacrifice I have to make as a father and as a husband: being away from my family,"" Beckham said. ""It is only for a short time, but it's difficult being away from the children every single day. But they understand it. They understand that Daddy works hard."" It is an experience which has caused some anguish for the former England captain, who takes great pride in being both a father and a husband, but has had to balance that with a busy traveling schedule. Not only has he played in Spain, the United States and Italy, he has also kept up his many business and charity commitments and recently agreed to become a football ambassador for China. ""The kids have moved across the world and I think he wanted them to have some stability,"" added Clement. ""The oldest, Brooklyn, is 14 now and it's important for him to get his education and feel settled and I think David felt that was crucial. ""It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me. ""David has four kids and he really missed them. They're a tight unit and he found it difficult."" For Clement, Beckham's arrival came at time of personal tragedy. His friend and colleague, PSG's former nutritionist Nick Broad, died in a highway accident last January. It was a period of great difficulty for Clement on a personal level and for all of those at the club. But in Beckham, he found somebody to confide in and talk to -- a man completely different to that portrayed in fashion magazines and tabloid newspapers. ""He's just a normal guy,"" said Clement. ""He's quite shy in his own way, but he's good to be around and he likes to have a laugh and be with his friends. ""For me, it was great that he was there just after Nick died because that was an awful time. ""It was great to have him around. It was a bit weird at first, because I'd read so much about him through the press and had my own impression. ""But speaking to people who knew him, I knew he was an absolute gentleman. For somebody so famous, he's just a normal guy. He's very professional, does all the right things and is a great example to the younger players."" Despite his advancing years, Beckham appeared to be in peak condition, showing a level of fitness which would embarrass some of the younger players in the PSG squad. But while he may have yet been able to continue playing, the off-field situation gave an inkling of what was to come, according to Clement. ""I had a feeling it might happen and he's going out at the top, which is the way he would like it,"" he added. ""He could have continued on a football level because he's certainly fit enough. But he might have been a bit-part player next season or had to move to another club and I think he wanted to go out at the very top. ""He's really enjoyed being in Paris and competing at a high level after time in the U.S. He may have not thought it would have ever happened again, but he made the most of it."" While Beckham will curtail his time in Paris at the end of the season, Clement hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager Carlo Ancelotti. But although the midfielder will exit following the final game against Lorient on May 27, his time at the club will not be forgotten. ""It's nice to work with good players,"" said Clement. ""But it's more important to work with good people.""","David Beckham found it difficult without wife and children in Paris .

"(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school. The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults. As shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing. When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed. Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises. Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope . But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy. ""We think it's good he's going back,"" Wilford said. ""If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him."" 'I think I'll be OK,' Sandy Hook student says after first day . But Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said. They won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school. Instead, Richie and his classmates are expected to travel to Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe, where a green-and-white banner greeting the children hangs on a fence. Survivor's attorney withdraws lawsuit . Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school. ""(We want) to have as much (of) a normal routine as possible,"" she said. ""(Thursday) is a regular schedule, and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids."" The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students. Even the school's pet turtle was relocated, Robinson said. Security measures have also been increased, with a new system incorporating more cameras and locks, according to Jim Agostine, superintendent of Monroe Public Schools. ""I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,"" Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said.

"Quantico, Virginia (CNN) -- There aren't many people who would voluntarily be pepper-sprayed, but at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia young Marines are doing just that. It's part of their training to protect U.S. embassies around the world. After they get a face full of pepper spray, the Marines must immediately complete a course that includes various defensive obstacles. ""We need to have an understanding of what it does,"" 21-year-old Cpl. Haley Whisenant explained to CNN about 20 minutes after having been sprayed directly in her eyes. ""If we were to spray someone and we are contaminated with it as well, we need to know how to contain ourselves,"" she said. The embassy guard training also includes one-on-one defensive tactics and weapons familiarization. CNN got exclusive access inside the Marine Security Guard training program at Quantico, where Marines are training as the service tries to almost double the number of its members posted at embassies and consulates worldwide. The 2013 Defense Authorization Act, which President Barack Obama signed in January, approves the addition of 1,000 Marines to the current force of 1,200. Plans to increase the size of the force were under way at the time of the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, resulting in the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. Marine security guards were not assigned to the post in Benghazi when it was attacked, and it is unclear whether Marine guards could have helped or even prevented the attack. Marine security guards are currently posted at embassies and consulates in 137 countries, with a total of 152 compounds being protected. The Corps works directly with the State Department to determine locations Marines will guard. State Department officials recently announced Marine Corps guard protection for approximately 50 additional embassies. ""We also will create a quick-response unit that will be able to augment embassy security in case there are indications ... in a particular country ... and that ambassador wants reinforcement with more Marines,"" Col. Michael Robinson, commanding officer of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group, told CNN's Barbara Starr. The Security Augmentation Unit will consist of approximately 100 guards that can be dispatched on a moment's notice. They will be on a ""quick tether,"" according to Robinson. ""So instead of requesting through the normal military channels...they would come directly to us, and we would be able to provide this security augmentation unit to help reinforce that particular embassy or consulate,"" he said. Marine security guards do not stand guard outside of their assigned embassy. Instead, local guards provided from the host country are designated to protect the e(s). ""We're responsible for mainly internal security within a compound,"" Robinson said. Although most of these enlisted trainees are young -- typically 20 or 21 years old -- security guard is not an entry-level position. It is considered a ""special duty"" assignment, meaning applicants must first work in their trained specialty -- like infantry or mechanic work -- before becoming a security guard. He or she must be single. Additionally, Marine security guidelines state that guards must have maturity, judgment, moral character and financial stability. An applicant with a lot of debt will not be accepted into the program. In addition, the Marine must have top secret security clearance and submit to a polygraph. Once they graduate, these Marines must do three years of embassy security duty. On a recent sunny spring afternoon, Robinson watched over a group of Marines in training. ""How you doing? Not too bad, right? Didn't kill you, right?!"" he asked a corporal who'd just been pepper-sprayed moments earlier. ""No sir, still alive, sir,"" the young Marine responded. ""You ready to go out to post? Where do you want to go -- which post?"" Robinson asked. ""It doesn't matter sir, as long as I get to serve."" he replied.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Defense is giving the go-ahead to all active-duty military personnel to wear their uniform to march in a gay pride parade in San Diego on Saturday, the first time such approval has been given in the United States. The Defense Department decision followed news that the Navy had given approval to sailors to wear their uniform in the parade, which drew hundreds of active-duty service members last year shortly before the administration repealed ""don't ask, don't tell."" ""Based on our current knowledge of the event and existing policies, we hereby are granting approval for service members in uniform to participate in this year's parade,"" Rene C. Bardorf, deputy assistant secretary of defense for community and public outreach, said in a memorandum released Thursday. The blanket approval for the various branches of the military applies only to the 2012 San Diego Pride Parade, Bardorf said. Just a year ago, an active-duty service member faced punishment or discharge if he or she admitted being homosexual, but last September the administration scrapped the policy known as ""don't ask, don't tell."" The Defense Department approval to allow service members to wear uniforms at the San Diego parade follows reports that members of the military wore uniforms at a gay pride event held at the Pentagon in June. Under the guidelines released by the Defense Department, service members can wear their uniforms to march in the parade as long as they participate ""in a personal capacity"" and follow set standards of ""appearance and wear of the military uniform."" While members of the military do not need approval to participate in civic events, they generally need approval to wear their uniforms. More than 300 active-duty service members have signed up to participate in the parade, Dwayne Crenshaw, executive director of San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride, said Thursday. Last year, roughly 200 active-duty and retired military service members marched in the San Diego parade, donning T-shirts to indicate their branch of military service. The 2011 parade took place one day after a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the ""don't ask, don't tell'' policy. The policy was formally revoked months later.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- India's air force geared up for possible missions against suspected terrorist camps in Pakistan in the immediate aftermath of November's Mumbai attacks, U.S. military officials told CNN Monday. One U.S. official said India's air force ""went on alert"" after the attacks in Mumbai. Pakistan said it would defend itself if attacked. ""We don't want to go to war,"" Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Gilani announced during a speech at the National Assembly on Monday. ""But if the war is thrust on us, we will stand united like a respectful nation."" While the officials characterized the Indian actions as preliminary preparations to position the air force if strikes were ordered, the comments indicate that the two nuclear powers were perhaps closer to conflict than previously acknowledged. Three Pentagon officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, have individually confirmed to CNN that the United States has information indicating that India began to prepare air force personnel for a possible mission. The officials offered few details, but one said India's air force ""went on alert."" A second official said the United States concluded these preliminary preparations would put India in a position to move swiftly against suspected terrorist camps and targets inside Pakistan, before adding that a number of senior U.S. officials urged India to exercise restraint during this time. An Indian air force official had no comment. CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported last week that the air force had been put on its highest level of readiness and that the aircraft had been armed. ""We are certainly against terrorism, but that doesn't mean that we go at war with any country,"" Indian Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major told CNN-IBN Thursday, adding that any decision on military action would be ""up to the government because the air force and the army are there only to carry out the will of the government."" Air Commodore Homayoon Ziqar, a spokesman for the Pakistani air force, told CNN that Pakistan is not on heightened alert at the moment. ""Everything is normal,"" he said. Another source in Pakistan's military also said the air force is not on heightened alert, but added, ""We are always ready, on weekends, on holidays, no matter what the circumstances."" Since the Mumbai attacks, Pakistani security forces raided a camp near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, according to military sources. It was the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the Mumbai attacks. India says the Pakistan-based Islamic militant group was behind the killings of more than 160 people in Mumbai.  Watch Miss Pakistan talk about the Mumbai attacks » . Also, Pakistani authorities have banned a charity linked to last month's attacks and placed its leader under house arrest. The move came after the U.N. Security Council designated the charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a terror organization because of its links to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. Gilani's promise that Pakistan would defend itself came amid mounting international pressure for him to crack down on Lashkar-e-Tayyiba. U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said he was ""encouraged"" that Pakistan arrested two of the group's top leaders last week, saying it amounted to the first steps toward determining who plotted the Mumbai siege. Indian police say the only surviving suspect from the Mumbai attacks, identified by Indian authorities as 21-year-old Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, is from Pakistan's Punjab province and the other nine attackers also were from Pakistan. Pakistani officials have denied that assertion, blaming instead ""stateless actors."" Until now, the Bush Administration has publicly said it saw no signs of military movement by India and no indication that the Indian government was preparing any type of retaliation. The Pentagon officials broadly described the activity as checking the status of crews, fighter jets and weapons that were available. The extent of the reported preparation was not immediately known. Also, one of the Pentagon officials confirmed that the United States has intelligence indicating a single Indian aircraft violated Pakistani airspace twice on Saturday. The United States believes the incursion was inadvertent, the official said, adding that there is no information to indicate it was planned. Meanwhile, suspected U.S. missile strikes continued to hammer Pakistan's tribal region, killing three people in a North Waziristan village Monday evening, according to a Pakistani military official. Monday's strike is the 29th suspected U.S. missile strike in Pakistan this year.

"(CNN) -- Representatives of Bangladesh's government, industry and workers issued a joint statement Saturday laying out an ""action plan"" to improve worker safety in the wake of a series of disasters that have beset the industry in the past six months. Under the plan: . -- A labor law reform package is to be submitted to Parliament during its next session, which is expected to be called in June, to boost protection ""for the fundamental rights to freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, as well as occupational safety and health."" -- By the end of the year, garment factories whose products are intended for export are to be inspected and repairs begun for those that need them. The plan calls for the International Labour Organization, which has sent a delegation to Bangladesh, to help mobilize the technical know-how and money needed to carry out the assessment. -- Within six months, the government is to hire 200 more inspectors and ensure that the Department of the Chief Inspector of Factories and Establishments will be given the resources needed to recruit and manage at least 800 inspectors. -- A fire-safety plan for the ready-made garment industry is to be strengthened and implemented. The action plan calls for progress to be measured in six months. Three incidents led to the plan's creation. In January, seven people died in a factory fire at Smart Export Garments, in Dhaka; two months earlier, 112 people were killed at Tazreen Fashions Limited, on the outskirts of the capital. The April 24 collapse of the Rana Plaza Building in the capital's suburb of Savar is the most serious disaster to strike the industry. As of Saturday, 547 bodies had been recovered, 22 more than on Friday, the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha News Agency reported. The number of survivors rescued from the rubble remained at 2,443, ""as you cannot expect anyone to survive under the debris at this point,"" Assistant Director of Fire Service and Civil Defense Aminur Rahman told BSS. ""Those responsible for the tragic events that have occurred in Bangladesh over the past six months shall be held accountable,"" the plan says. ""Unless lawful actions are taken at the earliest more lives may be lost in preventable industrial accidents."" In their joint statement, the representatives of government, industry and labor called for international buyers and brands to ""take increased responsibility for improving working conditions and safety and health."" They also called on the ILO to initiate a program to train those workers who were hurt in the incidents. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers & Exporters Association and the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers & Exporters Association are to give alternative work to those who became disabled as a result of their injuries, it says. Preliminary results of a government inquiry into last week's building collapse found that ""heavy machinery and high-capacity generators"" were ""largely responsible,"" the news agency reported Friday. ""During the inquiry, we have found that use of substandard materials during the construction also contributed to the building collapse,"" the leader of the inquiry, Main Uddin Khandaker, told BSS. Bangladesh's $20 billion garment industry accounts for 77% of the country's exports. Among those caught up in the finger pointing after the disaster are Western retailers and clothing brands that Bangladeshi suppliers say put heavy pressure on prices, resulting in bad pay and conditions for workers.","A labor package is to be submitted to Parliament .

"Cairo (CNN) -- -- Turkey's prime minister planted himself at the heart of the Arab world's turbulent politics on Tuesday, when he declared himself a champion of the Palestinian cause during a speech at the headquarters of the League of Arab States. ""Our Palestinian brothers should declare an independent state,"" Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced to an assembly of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo. ""Now is the time to have the Palestinian flag in Gaza, and the Palestinian flag should go to the United Nations,"" Erdogan said to applause from the audience. ""Let us hoist the Palestinian flag to the sky, and this should be a symbol of justice and peace in the Middle East."" Erdogan put an end to decades of relative Turkish isolation from the Arab world. During a speech that sought to highlight shared history, values and faith, he frequently referred to Arabs as ""brothers."" He also addressed the sweeping political changes that are rapidly transforming many Arab countries by repeating his endorsement of the rebel Transitional National Council in Libya, which recently captured the capital of Tripoli. Erdogan said the rebel council ""reflects the will of the [Libyan] people."" It has been less than three weeks since the TNC's representative to the Arab League replaced toppled dictator Moammar Gadhafi's seat at the assembly. In a move that is sure to win support on the streets of many Arab cities and towns, the Turkish leader continued his diplomatic offensive against Israel. ""They [Israel] should pay the price for these attacks and crimes they committed,"" Erdogan said, reminding the audience of the botched May 2010 Israeli commando raid against a Turkish-led humanitarian convoy sailing to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. The Turkish government expelled Israel's ambassador this month and suspended all bilateral military agreements after the Jewish state refused to apologize or pay compensation for eight Turks and an American who were shot dead by Israeli troops. Israel argues its forces fired in self defense after passengers aboard the ship Mavi Marmara attacked its boarding party with clubs and chains. Erdogan repeated his vow to take Israel before the International Court of Justice for the deaths. The assembled foreign ministers applauded when Erdogan said, ""Israel should compensate the rights of the families of the victims. Otherwise there will never be normalization [of relations] between Israel and Turkey."" A crowd of several thousand cheering Egyptians mobbed the VIP terminal of Cairo airport late Monday night to greet Erdogan when he arrived in Egypt.Many of the mostly male supporters carried banners identifying themselves as members of the Muslim Brotherhood, a movement that has long been banned in Egypt until the recent overthrow of authoritarian president Hosni Mubarak. ""We consider him as the Islamic leader in the Middle East, and we appreciate what he did for Gaza,"" said a young man at the airport named Mohammed Fahed. He was clutching a poster with Erdogan's face on it, and said he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. But outside the Arab League headquarters on Tuesday, a less welcoming crowd greeted the Turkish leader. Several dozen young men holding Syrian flags chanted ""Erdogan, Erdogan, coward,"" as he walked toward his waiting car after giving his speech. ""Erdogan he did not mention Syria,"" said Syrian film director Maan Alhasba. ""Over six months Syria is bleeding... We were expecting a serious speech about the problem in Syria. He did not mention it at all."" The Turkish government has repeatedly criticized the brutal military crackdown on protesters in Syria, but Erdogan made no mention of Turkey's neighbor to the east during his speech in the Arab League. Egypt is the first stop on what some are calling the Turkish prime minister's ""Revolution Tour."" He is scheduled to travel next to Tunisia and Libya, two other North African countries that have seen their dictators overthrown during the Arab Spring.","Turkish prime minister addresses Arab foreign ministers in Cairo .

"(CNN) -- A conservative novelist in Saudi Arabia has triggered a firestorm on social media after one his tweets was misunderstood in Western media. The translation snafu hinged on a subtle grammatical fine point, said Abdallah al-Dawood. An article on the Financial Times online reported that he had called for women working as cashiers to be sexually harassed. The story was picked up by several news outlets, including the BBC and the Huffington Post. Even Arab media that reported on him used the erroneous Western translation. Al Arabiya, for example, cited the BBC story. Al-Dawood sought to clarify his stance in interviews with journalists. Speaking with Sabq, a Saudi daily, the hardliner vented his anger over the mistranslation of his message. No one had called or messaged him to confirm its meaning, he said. By then it was too late. It all began with a tweet on Sunday. Women in Saudi Arabia have begun working in shops, triggering vitriol from religious conservatives. Al-Dawood took to Twitter to express in his conservative criticism of women working as receptionists or cashiers to his 98,000 plus followers. He linked to an ultra-conservative academic study to support his view. His tweet: . Getting lots of ""interaction in the trending of #femalecashiers #harassfemalecashiers This a link to a master's degree thesis that considers the job of the female receptionist and cashier to be human trafficking."" The hash tag #harassfemalecashiers raised ire with some who took it as a command to 'harass female cashiers.' But in Arabic the wording can be understood two ways. Al-Dawood was using the phase to say: ""They would harass female cashiers,"" he has said. He was arguing that woman should not work as cashiers, because they would be harassed. A prominent female tweeter with over 22,000 followers lit into Al-Dawood. @NoonArabia wrote: ""Sickening! MT: @Happy_Arab: #Saudi extremist calls upon men to sexually harass #women cashiers."" Ahmed Saleeti, a Saudi netizen with nearly 14,000 followers, tweeted ""... there is nothing worse and silliest than the causes that we deal with and no one is more trivial than our religious scholars."" Al-Dawood believes that if women are allowed to work at certain jobs, some men will treat with them with as much disrespect as they would trafficked women. Now he is experiencing firsthand the new reality in the age of social media: one need not even leave home to get a hard time in public.","A conservative writer argued in a tweet that working women in Saudi Arabia would be harassed .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Ending years of speculation over the future leader of one of India's largest and most influential business groups, Tata Sons Wednesday named 43-year-old Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as the successor to business icon Ratan Tata, the man who has led the $80 billion conglomerate for the past two decades. The company broke away from tradition by appointing a non-family member for the first time in its almost 150-year-old history. Mistry said in a statement that he was ""deeply honored"" and he was aware that an ""enormous responsibility, with a great legacy, has been entrusted"" to him. Mistry is not new to the group; he has been on the board of Tata Sons since 2006 and will now serve as the group's deputy chairman until Ratan Tata retires in December 2012. Mistry is currently the managing director of construction giant Shapoorji Pallonji & Co. His family owns 18% stake in Tata Sons, making the family the second biggest share-holder behind Tata Trust which has a 67% stake. Mistry said in a statement that he will ""legally dissociate"" himself from the management of his family businesses however ""to avoid any issue of conflict of interest."" Tata said the appointment of Mistry was a ""good and far-sighted choice"" and that he had been ""impressed with the quality and caliber of his participation, his astute observations and his humility."" ""I will be committed to working with him over the next year to give him the exposure, the involvement and the operating experience to equip him to undertake the full responsibility of the group on my retirement,"" he added. Tata, 73, is a bachelor with no children. He took over the family business in 1991 and has been credited for pioneering different markets and turning ""Tata"" into a household name. With more than 100 companies in various sectors from steel to automobiles to tea, spread across 80 countries, Tata Sons employs almost half a million people around the world. His international forays include the acquisition of British luxury automobiles brand Jaguar and Land Rover, Tetley Tea and European steel giant Corus. At home, Tata made headlines when he launched what he has described as his favorite venture the Tata Nano -- the world's cheapest car. Tata Sons also own the Taj group of hotels, including the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower in Mumbai which was at the center of the deadly 2008 terrorist attacks. In a recent interview with CNN, Tata had said he would like to leave behind a group of companies that continues his family's legacy. ""What I would like to do is to leave behind a sustainable entity of a set of companies that operate in an exemplary manner in terms of ethics, values and continue what our ancestors left behind. And, I hope my successor will will be as committed to that as I have tried to be."" He went on to say, ""My only regret is that I am not 20 years younger because I think India's going through a very exciting period in its history.""","Tata Sons is an $80 billion conglomerate .

"(CNN) -- Three California Marines have been charged with marrying for financial gain, accused of manipulating the military's off-base housing program so a lesbian couple could live together, according to a woman at the center of the case. Marine Cpl. Ashley Vice says she and two others have been charged with conspiracy, making false official statements, fraud and adultery for allegedly marrying to collect thousands in financial assistance offered by the military to heterosexual married couples. ""The bottom line is that every Marine knows if they violate the law, they will be held accountable for their actions,"" 1st Lt. Maureen Dooley, a Marine spokeswoman at Camp Pendleton, told CNN. ""Regardless of sexual preference, we will hold all Marines accountable to the same standards."" Dooley would not release details about the case, saying the ""investigation is ongoing."" Vice told CNN affiliate KGTV in San Diego that she wanted to live off base with her girlfriend, Jaime Murphy, as a couple. Murphy is a civilian. But on her salary, she couldn't afford it. So she says she found a Marine, Jeremiah Griffin, who agreed to marry her so she could receive the $1,200 per month living stipend the Marine Corps gives to married couples living off base. A year and a half later, Murphy did the same thing and married Marine Joseph Garner, Vice and Murphy told KGTV, according to footage that aired Thursday. Vice said she was questioned by the Marine Corps about the living arrangements. ""I honestly didn't even try to hide it,"" she said. ""I just said this is what's going on. They asked me who Jaime is ... I told them."" The three Marines are accused of pocketing about $75,000. ""There's no conspiracy here,"" Murphy told KGTV. ""There's no trying to steal from anybody. We just wanted to be together and she wanted to serve her country."" Vice and the two others face up to a year in prison if convicted on all counts.

"(CNN) -- Despite the global financial crisis, China's rich are getting richer. ""As of April this year, China has 960,000 millionaires with personal assets of 10 million yuan (US$1.5 million),"" says Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman of the Hurun Research Institute, which compiles China's rich list. ""It has 60,000 super-rich with 100 million yuan assets, and their numbers keep growing,"" he says. The newly affluent are getting more outwardly mobile, too. Nearly half of them are thinking of emigrating overseas, according to a Hurun Research Institute report. About 14 per cent of them have or are in the process of applying for emigration, it said. ""In Chinese, emigration refers also to getting a permanent residency, or a 'green card',"" Hoogewerf explains. ""We estimate this to make up 80% of the total who want to 'emigrate'."" Many businessmen are capitalizing on this trend. Among them is Larry Wang, founder and chairman of Well Trend United Inc, one of the leading immigration consulting companies in China. Born and bred in Beijing, Wang went to Canada in 1985 for post-graduate studies. He stayed until 1995 when he decided to return to Beijing. ""China's economy then was changing rapidly,"" he recalled. ""I asked myself, what does Canada have to offer China? Maple syrup and immigration. I couldn't sell syrup so I got into the immigration business."" His business has grown the past 17 years. Well Trend now employs 500 people who work in 10 major cities across China, handling immigration and student visa applications. The company charges 12,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan to help clients secure student and immigrant visas. ""Over the years we've helped more than 10,000 applicants for immigration,"" Wang says, including many millionaires. But why are China's newly affluent seeking to emigrate? Some do so for convenience, experts say. ""A foreign passport makes it a lot easier for them to travel around the world,"" Wang says. ""They don't want to go through tedious visa applications all the time."" China's new rich -- a mixed group of Red capitalists, young tycoons and up-and-coming ""fuerdai"" (second-generation capitalist scions) -- are typically cosmopolitan and tech-savvy, frequent travelers who are willing to pay a premium for convenience. They are also ready to spend on education for their children to give them a competitive edge in a new kind of rat race, in which millions of Chinese are striving for advancement. Wang remembers the case of Li Weijie, 44, a longtime client who emigrated to Canada more than 10 years ago and who refers to the move as ""the best decision I've ever made in my life."" Liu's teenage son did not excel at school in China, but after entering the University of British Columbia he blossomed and is now doing well in Canada. Liu, a real estate mogul, is still doing a lucrative business in China. Likewise, many Chinese millionaires who apply for U.S. ""alien investor's visa"" --applicants have to commit $500,000 to $1 million in capital investment -- seek permanent resident status there so their children will have easier access to U.S. education. ""In the long run, after their children complete their undergrad or graduate studies, they would have the opportunity to compete for jobs without having to find an employer willing to sponsor them for U.S. work visas,"" says Joyce Gomez, an immigration lawyer based in Washington. A small percentage of the applicants, she adds, intend to operate their own businesses in the U.S. after they obtain permanent resident status. Hoogewerf cites other reasons. He says some millionaires opt to leave to escape China's insufficient medical care, pollution and food safety. ""There is also an element of insurance against economic, social and potential political unrest,"" he says. Still, Wang does not see the spike in emigration as a mass exodus of millionaires. ""It's very normal that people would want to leave and see the outside world after they've made a fortune,"" he says. ""The same thing has happened in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea."" Wang thinks it's a good thing. ""It's globalization,"" he says. ""It facilitates exchange of business ideas and helps bridge cultural gaps."" Even when they emigrate, experts say, most Chinese elite keep one foot planted in China. ""They keep their businesses here,"" says Victor Lum, a former immigration specialist at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing, and now a top executive at Well Trend. ""These millionaires are familiar with China's unique culture,"" says Lum. ""They have succeeded here, but success elsewhere is not guaranteed."" Hoogewerf agrees. ""When weighed against the gains to be made in China today, not to mention the prevailing confusion in the European and U.S. markets, most Chinese prefer to keep significant part of their assets in China,"" he says. ""This is also where they are 'at home' no matter their passport or residency."" Some 40% of the Chinese millionaires polled by the Hurun Research Institute prefer to set up their ""second home"" in the U.S., followed by Canada, Singapore and Europe. ""The U.S. requires shorter time of stay in the country to gain permanent resident status and their other procedures are less complicated,"" says Wang. But the hurdles on the way into America are high, too, says Gomez. ""An alien investor applicant must be able to demonstrate that the funds invested were obtained from a legitimate source,"" she explains. An applicant may also be rejected if they are unable to demonstrate that their capital investment in the enterprise will create or preserve at least 10 jobs for qualified American workers within the U.S. Legal fees from immigration attorneys that prepare the applications are not cheap. ""It can range from $15,000 to $25,000,"" says Gomez. But for the Chinese millionaires, that's small change.","Nearly half of China's super rich are thinking of emigrating overseas .
China's new rich are typically cosmopolitan and tech-savvy .

"(CNN) -- The world's population is expected to hit 7 billion around October 31 and one Chinese demographer says that number would have come a lot sooner had it not been for China's ""one-child policy."" Zhai Zhenwu, a professor at Renmin University School of Sociology and Population, says but for China's population policy, the world's 7 billionth baby would have been born five years earlier. ""China's population would now be around 1.7 billion had it not been for the family planning policy,"" said Zhai. ""And the world's population would have hit seven billion in 2006."" China holds the largest population on earth with 1.34 billion people, but will not for long, as the fertility level has been declining for years. Since the Chinese government adopted its so-called ""family planning policy"" three decades ago, China has limited couples to one child, with few exceptions. Those who broke the rule were slapped with heavy fines or were forced to abort pregnancies. Since 1979, experts at the National Population and Family Planning Commission of China say, the policy has prevented more than 400 million births in the country. Why was the draconian policy necessary? Proponents rationalized it as an emergency measure to curb the large number of births expected from the baby boomers of the 1960s. ""It was designed in 1979 to be a temporary one that required the 'sacrifice of two or three generations,' as they put it then,"" says Aprodicio Laquian, who served as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) representative and senior adviser on population in China from 1984 to 1990. ""It was meant to be implemented until the annual population growth rate reached replacement levels, or 1.5 children per woman of reproductive age."" The Canadian demographer says supporters of the policy now cite the double-digit economic growth rate since 1979 as the so-called ""demographic dividend."" Laquian explains: ""If population control had not been enforced, China would most likely be economically and socially worse off today."" The population policy might have also helped girls and women get ahead, as a survey by the All-China Women's Federation and the National Bureau of Statistics found. But the policy has also brought about a list of unintended socio-economic consequences. China's one-child policy has been blamed for abuses, including female infanticide and forced abortions and sterilizations. Chinese traditionally prefer boys over girls because they are seen as more able to provide for the family and carry on the family line. As a result, the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls still continues today in rural areas. This remains a sensitive topic in China, poignantly depicted in Mo Yan's ""Frog,"" a novel about a midwife in rural China and her experiences with forced abortions and sterilizations. Mo recently won China's prestigious Mao Dun literary award --a potential indication that China has become more open to talking about the issue. China is now facing a lopsided sex ratio in infants and young children. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, for every 100 Chinese girls born, there are about 123 boys. The global norm is about 100 to 103-106. At that rate, China is likely to have some 30 million unmarried men by 2020. The unusually rapid decline in fertility has also produced a rapidly aging population. Two decades ago, demographers say, the share of China's population aged 60 and above was only 7.6%. That has risen to 10.5%, according to China's 2000 census, and has now reached around 12%, or 167 million. By 2025, demographers predict, one in five Chinese who live in urban areas will be 60 or older. By 2050, there would be only 1.6 working-age adults for every person aged 60 and above. That means a heavy dependency ratio. In 10 years, the 20-24 age population is expected to comprise of only half of today's 124 million. Experts say this could cripple the health care and social insurance system with fewer young people taking care of the aging population. If the government does not change its policies, experts say, China's population could become old before it becomes rich. The high cost of the one-child policy is felt deeply by Beijing resident Xiao Xuan, an only-child daughter of a college professor and shopping mall manager. Xiao, 22, says she was blessed with all the attention and resources showered at her from childhood. Still, she says, she had a mostly lonely childhood. ""I used to cut myself on my wrist after being yelled at by my mom and dad because I didn't know who I should talk to or turn to,"" she says. ""I was like that for almost two years, but I am very tough so I made it through."" ""I hate to say it but the one-child policy should partly be blamed for some social issues of youth today,"" she adds. ""It's been a ridiculous government interference on family issues."" She wished she had a brother or a sister to share all the attention. ""I am the only one there, so all their energy goes to me,"" she says. ""They care of no one else but me, and live vicariously through me, because they can count on no one else. Parents' love could multiply if there are more kids in the family, but if you are the only one, you get only one piece of cake, not a whole bakery."" Canadian demographer Aprodicio Laquian says the Chinese authorities are aware of these unintended consequences of their population policies and are committed to dealing with the situation. ""It is anticipated that China's strict population control program will most likely be relaxed as the objective situation changes,"" he said. For Xiao Xuan's parents, however, such a relaxation of policy may come too late. ""My parents have often expressed regret,"" she says. ""They said they should have had another kid regardless of how much the [government] fined back then.""","If not for China's one-child policy, world population would have hit 7 billion five years ago .
Fertility rates in China, the world's most populous nation, are declining .

"(CNN) -- Linda Ross was instantly hooked the moment she received her first pair of Betsey Johnson earrings as a gift for her 16th birthday. The dangling, leopard-print hearts became her go-to accessory for adding oomph to any outfit. Now, amid news that 67 Betsey Johnson retail stores in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom are liquidating and closing for good, this ""Betsey Girl"" from Brunswick, Georgia, is scrambling to acquire as much merchandise as she can. Since the fashion house filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, Ross has driven to the nearest boutique in Jacksonville, Florida, for loot from the brand's high-end Betsey Johnson Collection. ""Her styles combine the young and girly elements -- like bows, floral patterns, excessive use of hot pink, and sparkles -- with mature and sexy elements, like corsets, high platform heels, lace, fishnets and lipstick,"" Ross said. At 18, Ross embodies that ""not a girl, not yet a woman"" aesthetic at the heart of the designer's look for decades. An icon of the ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" mentality, Johnson is known for her bold and flirty apparel and accessories that incorporate just about every motif of feminine style imaginable, from tulle and silk to pastels and sequins. The brand itself isn't going away. The decision to shutter stores is part of a larger effort to focus on wholesale business, said a spokesman for Steve Madden, which has owned the brand's intellectual property rights since 2010. Sales will continue until July or until a store runs out of stock. Nor is Johnson disappearing the industry scene. She will stay on as creative director of Betsey Johnson and continue working on the brand's less expensive line, which is sold in department stores and specialty boutiques across the country. She even attended the annual Council of Fashion Designers of America awards on Monday, suggesting that her days of cartwheeling down the runway are not quite over. Yet, the prospect of her fading from the landscape provoked an outpouring of nostalgia from a generation of fans who connect moments in their lives with her designs. ""I remember first seeing Betsey's designs when I was a little girl in fashion magazines. Thought she was so cool and looked like she was having so much fun, surrounded by all that color & whimsey!"" a fan wrote on Betsey Johnson's Facebook page. ""She inspired me to become a jewelry designer, really gonna miss her, but I'm sure she won't just be sitting around, doing nothing, with all that energy & imagination! Best of luck to you & thanks!"" There's a lot of sentimental longing connected with her designs, said Leah Chernikoff, executive editor of fashion and style blog, Fashionista. For a lot of people, a Betsey Johnson was their first fancy dress. ""The reason she's so beloved is that she is sort of her own person and unique in the fashion landscape,"" she said. ""She's effusive and energetic and positive so that even if young 20-somethings in Williamsburg aren't clamoring to wear Betsey Johnson, or maybe they are because it's ironic at this point, she's not someone who's seen as tired."" Much of her popularity stems from her industry longevity, not only as a businesswoman but as a vibrant personality known for ending her runway shows with a cartwheel, Chernikoff said. Johnson's career began in 1964, when she officially entered the New York fashion scene by winning Mademoiselle magazine's Guest Editor Contest, her company biography says. One year later, she landed the top designer position for Paraphernalia, a clothing boutique that housed the hottest young designers. In 1978, after a decade of designing for other labels, Betsey decided to launch the Betsey Johnson label as it is known today. In 1972, Johnson, along with Halston, won the Coty ""Winnie"" Award for outstanding designs. At the 1999 CFDA Awards, Betsey was presented the Timeless Talent Award, created especially for her, which recognized her influence on fashion throughout her career. In late 2002, Betsey was inducted into the Fashion Walk of Fame, honoring her contribution to American fashion. The demise of her stores signals the end of an era. As customers gradually buy up the last of the stock inside her standalone stores, what were once pink-walled paradises, equal parts princess and punk, are now somber shells. A visit on Sunday to the store in Georgia's Perimeter Mall revealed lonely racks stripped bare of toile jumpers, sequin dolman tunics and crepe babydoll dresses. The elaborate displays of colorful purses were gone, leaving empty spaces in their place. The pink flowered bench where customers used to try on funky bejeweled high-heeled platform shoes had a big 'SOLD' sign on it, as did the artwork in one of the dressing rooms. Only a few varieties of the celebrated shoes remained on the shelves. All of the furnishing and fixtures, including those shelves, were also for sale or sold already. Yet, the poofy prom-style dresses still cost more than $100, even after storewide discounts from 30% to 60%, underscoring complaints that her goods were too expensive and ran too small for the general population. ""I bet if the prices were more reasonable this would not have happened,"" one fan wrote on the Betsey Johnson Facebook page. ""I love her clothes, but it's hard for me to fit in them. They are made for tiny women; I'm a 12. Maybe if she started making larger sizes she could stay open,"" another Facebook fan said. It's a risky move for brands to bypass department stores and branch out into retail because then they have the costs of real estate and overhead to worry about, which usually requires a steep markup, said Vincent Quan, associate professor of fashion marketing management at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. ""If your growth is anemic and someone else's growth is higher than yours, they're gaining the market share at your expense,"" Quan said. It's tempting to blame the economy, he said, but the luxury goods market has experienced an upswing the past two years. The plain and simple truth is that customers simply stopped shopping at Betsey Johnson as other brands gained market share, he said. ""You need to think about your target customer and reason for being. She was fun and exciting but you need a product that sells. Your customer out there is looking for goods that are trendy and things you can wear. They're also looking at your competition,"" he said. ""When you talk to fans there's a loyalty element, she's hip and cool, but style changes and how does that change affect your purchasing decisions?"" This isn't goodbye forever, though. Through parent company Steve Madden, Betsey Johnson and Betseyville merchandise will still be available in department stores worldwide, which is good news for Janna Robles, who embraces Johnson's exaggerated girliness with a womanly edge. ""I love how she plays with loud colors, unique prints, and sparkly things. I also love the fact that even though her designs are girly and feminine, she makes sure that there's a twist to them, making girls stand out in any crowd,"" the 24-year-old said. Robles, who lives in the Philippines, makes a stop at a Betsey Johnson boutique every time she visits relatives in the United States. That is, if she hasn't already convinced them to send her a little ""surprise"" in the mail. Johnson even inspired Robles to start designing her shoes while in law school. While some fans are raiding the shops to keep a bit of Betsey in their lives, one Kansas City fashionista has a unique connection to the iconic designer. Betsy Wanless, 27, had always been a fan of Betsey Johnson, but when she got married in 2011, her brand loyalty was solidified by holy matrimony. ""I was always Betsy Wanless, and then in 2011 I married Matt Johnson and am now Betsy Johnson."" On her wedding day, the former Ms. Wanless sported sky-high Betsey Johnson red shoes to pay tribute to her new name. While certainly no one can fill Johnson's shoes, Chernikoff of Fashionista doesn't think this is the end of Betsey Johnson. ""A lot of designers go (into) bankruptcy and bounce back. Her whole spirit is about being buoyant and resilient and seeing that translating to her business,"" she said. ""Her brand will still be around, just not in the same way.""

"(CNN) -- In a budget-cutting move, the Greek government closed, at least temporarily, state broadcaster ERT. Government spokesperson Simon Kedikoglou cited chronic corruption and mismanagement of funds as reasons for the closure. ""At a time when the Greek people are enduring sacrifices, there is no room for delay, hesitation or tolerance for sacred cows,"" Kedikoglou said in announcement shown on the broadcaster. At least several of ERT's three TV channels and radio services went off the air early Wednesday. Television viewers saw screens go black. ERT has said the decision means 2,656 employees will lose their jobs. In order to meet its commitments to its creditors, the Greek government has to dismiss 2,000 people from the wider public sector by the end of the year and 15,000 by the end of 2014. The new television and radio broadcaster will open with a much smaller staff, Kedikoglou said. A ""modern television and radio broadcaster will be established that will operate as soon as possible,"" he said. Existing employees will be able to apply for new positions. A time frame for the new organization has not been announced. Hundreds of employees gathered outside the ERT Athens headquarters to protest the move. Unions say they will fight the decision.","Greek government orders closure of state broadcaster ERT .

"(CNN) -- Frank Lautenberg grew up in Paterson, New Jersey -- a tough mill town. Served in World War II, where he scampered up improvised rickety poles to string wire to keep the lines of communication open. Went to Columbia on the GI Bill, then made a fortune as co-founder of ADP. He was among the first to see how computers could revolutionize business, and he put the new technology to work processing paychecks. He made millions in business, but never abandoned his liberal roots. His generous support for progressive causes earned him a spot on Nixon's infamous Enemies List. In 1982 he defeated Millicent Fenwick -- the pipe-smoking, progressive Republican who was the inspiration for the Doonesbury character Lacey Davenport -- and became a senator. In 1988 I served as Frank's press secretary. Few bosses were tougher. He was running for re-election against golden boy Pete Dawkins -- Heisman Trophy winner at West Point, Rhodes scholar, Vietnam vet, Army general, millionaire banker -- a man so handsome, he was a model in ads for men's shirts. Frank was not as glib as Dawkins, so I told the press, ""Frank may not be a great communicator, but he's a great legislator."" That did not go over well. ""I am paying you to say good things about me,"" he thundered. ""I can get people to criticize me for free!"" Lautenberg: The last 'swamp dog' Frank was so cantankerous, so combative, that he often called his 1988 campaign manager, the great James Carville, ""the second opponent."" But he rose to the occasion, besting Dawkins in a debate and embracing the nickname Dawkins used to dismiss him: ""swamp dog."" From that day to the last time I saw him, I would always ask Frank how the old swamp dog was doing. He never lost his bite. As a senator, Lautenberg leaves an impressive legacy. The Lautenberg Amendment helped free Soviet Jews and is still used by oppressed people seeking freedom in America. If you enjoy flying smoke-free, you can thank Frank. Firefighters who now have a right to know the chemicals they face in a fire can thank Frank. Millions who ride Amtrak or use mass transit can thank Frank. If you believe working people deserve a higher minimum wage, you can thank Frank. All of us who support the U.S.-Israel relationship can thank Frank. His brother and sister veterans have lost a friend, and those who support gun safety legislation have lost a powerful ally. Me? I have lost an example of toughness and tenacity. In an age of blow-dried, prefab, Ken-doll politicians, Frank was the real deal: a hard-bitten, gut-punching, proudly liberal swamp dog.

"(CNN) -- The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's ability to teach the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations relies on its collections. The museum has been on a 20th anniversary four-city tour to engage the public and gather artifacts that tell survivors' stories in vivid, lasting and personal ways. The museum held a historic gathering of Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans in Washington for a national marking of its 20th anniversary. The road trip started in Boca Raton, Florida, and continued in Los Angeles and New York. Now we're in Chicago, where Sunday, June 9, the museum will hold a daylong public event with many opportunities to engage with museum resources, people, and programs, and pay tribute to local Holocaust survivors and World War II veterans. In Los Angeles, we met a woman who was born in 1939, after her father was deported from Vienna, Austria, to the concentration camps, where he spent the next five years. Her mother and grandmother worked for the Jewish community and were never deported from Vienna. This woman spent her childhood in the hospital of the Viennese Jewish community, where her mother managed to survive and keep them from being deported. 7 life lessons from a Holocaust survivor . It was amazing that three generations of Jewish women managed to survive Nazi occupation. It is extremely unusual. They had to care for themselves, surviving day to day, and care for their very young child. It seems unfathomable they made it. In New York, a family donated letters and artifacts from their uncle and his wife, who were on the S.S. St. Louis, a ship that in 1939 left Hamburg, Germany, bound for the Americas with about 900 Jews aboard fleeing the Nazis. The were refused entry into Cuba and the United States and headed back to Europe, where many of them eventually wound up in the hands of the Nazis. The uncle and his wife were deported to concentration camps. The wife survived; the husband perished. When the survivors and other witnesses to the crimes of Nazi Germany are no longer able to tell their stories, it will be the collections -- artifacts, documents, pictures, films -- that will help transmit this history and its lessons. That's why we're racing to rescue the evidence of the Holocaust by working in 40 countries to preserve these materials. Elie Wiesel: Faith in the messenger . To date our collections include more than 17,250 objects, 68.1 million pages of documentation, 135 million digital images from the International Tracing Service, 87,500 photographs and images and more than 1,030 hours of video footage. We expect our collections to double in size over the next decade. The Museum's 20th anniversary is bringing Holocaust history to communities nationwide. Each tour stop featured programming that explores the history of the Holocaust and looks at why it remains so relevant for us today. Even if people cannot attend a tour stop or do not have collections to donate, people can still get involved. The Museum has developed 20 actions that anyone, anywhere can take to help preserve Holocaust memory and apply its lessons today. Visit ushmm.org/neveragain to see how you can participate. You can also see highlights from the previous tour stops and the National Tribute to Holocaust Survivors and World War II veterans. We will continue to examine issues like the dangers of hate and indifference, the threats of continuing mass violence and genocide and what we can do about them. We want people to understand this history and move from asking ""What would I have done?"" to ""What will I do?""

"(CNN) -- If it were not for the powerful stench and desperate shouts emanating from the wire cages, the men sitting in rows, each wearing a white skull cap, look like they could be at a prayer meeting. But for the 276 Rohingya men sitting on the floor of two cells designed to hold just 15 people each, their situation is about as far away from a mosque as it gets -- that was the scene, vividly described and shown in an a report by British news network and CNN affiliate, Channel 4. Appearing to have barely enough room to sit, some of the men reportedly had swollen feet and withered leg muscles from a lack of exercise and had not moved from the cage in five months. According to a new report from Human Rights Watch (HRW), the men are among 1,700 ethnic Rohingya from Myanmar -- formerly known as Burma -- who are being held in appalling conditions in Thai immigration detention centers in Thailand's Phang Nga province and filmed secretly by the news team from Channel 4. Tens of thousands of ethnic Rohingya from Myanmar's Arakan State have already fled persecution amid ongoing sectarian violence between the majority Buddhist Arakanese and the Muslim Rohingya. Many flee in small, unseaworthy boats arriving in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Some never make it to their destinations. Last month, a boat carrying about 100 Rohingya capsized off western Myanmar and at least 50 were feared drowned. HRW says the overcrowded conditions are part of an unsanctioned policy of deterring Rohingya from seeking asylum in Thailand. Q&A: What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? ""I think that the Thai policy is all about saying to the Rohingya, 'Hey, if you land in Thailand you're not going to have an easy time of it',"" Phil Robertson, deputy director of the Asia division of HRW, told CNN. ""By putting people in detention centers in these appalling conditions the Thai government is effectively saying come here at your own peril."" OPINION: Two-child policy in Myanmar will increase bloodshed . HRW says Thai immigration officials have not permitted UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee agency, to conduct refugee status determination screenings and have split up the Rohingya families with women and children sent to government-run shelters. According to the Channel 4 report, while the women and children are held in better conditions than the men, they often have no information about the status or even whereabouts of their partners. ""The government should immediately allow them to pursue their asylum claims with the UN refugee agency,"" said HRW Asia director Brad Adams, adding that under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to seek asylum from persecution. HRW also claimed that under Thailand's ""help on"" policy -- whereby Thai Navy vessels that intercept Rohingya boats supply them with fuel and provisions on condition the boats sail onward to Malaysia and Indonesia -- Rohingya were being put at further risk. ""Thai authorities should provide temporary protection to Rohingya and scrap the 'help on' policy that places these asylum seekers in harm's way,"" Adams said. ""The government should help Rohingya who escape from oppression and hardship in Burma -- not worsen their plight."" But Manasvi Srisodapol, spokesman for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CNN that Thai authorities were fully aware of and concerned about overcrowding at its existing immigration facilities. ""Since January, various groups of Rohingyas have been placed under the care of various immigration and detention centers and government shelters across Thailand, that notwithstanding, alternative arrangements are being identified as a matter of priority to address the issue of overcrowding, as well as in reuniting those Rohingyas with their family members."" He denied the government was not cooperating with international bodies over the issue, saying the government was working in close partnership with humanitarian agencies such as the UNHCR, UNICEF and the ICRC to provide temporary assistance to the refugees. He added that their asylum rights would be fully respected. ""Thailand has not been denying anyone, their basic human rights, he said. ""In fact Thailand is providing temporary assistance and shelters in spite the fact that these Rohingyas are illegal migrants. Furthermore, international organizations such as UNHCR, ICRC, IOM and UNICEF have access to these people on the regular basis."" Thailand's Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra agreed in January to permit Rohingya arriving by boat in Thailand to stay temporarily, initially for six months, until they could be safely repatriated or resettled in a third country. ""The Thai government is in close cooperation with various countries and international organizations to find a durable solution for the Rohingyas,"" said Srisodapol. ""The six-month period announced in January is a tentative time frame and we are examining various possibilities."" Critics fear that if the Thai government is unable to find a third country that would accept the asylum seekers, then Thailand may deport the Rohingya back to Myanmar where they would undoubtedly face persecution.

"(CNN) -- Slowly but surely, Rafael Nadal is feeling his confidence come back. Three days into his return to the ATP World Tour after a seven-month absence, the former world No. 1 has reached the singles semifinals of the VTR Open in Chile and also earned a shot at the doubles title. ""Today I had more confidence than the other days,"" Nadal said after Friday's victory over seventh-seeded fellow Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver. ""That is positive. It gives me confidence, and reasons to believe that I'm on the right way. I'm happy to win in singles against a tough opponent like Dani and to reach the semifinals after seven months."" Having not played since his shock second-round defeat at Wimbledon late last June, the 11-time grand slam champion has slipped to fifth in the rankings as he has battled knee problems and then an stomach illness that forced him to miss the Australian Open. ""In this tournament I had a good feeling. The crowd gave me their support all the time. It helps a lot when you come with a bad feeling,"" said the 26-year-old, who was to play French third seed Jeremy Chardy in Saturday's semifinals. The seven-time French Open champion is seeking his 37th title on clay, having stretched his Open era win record to 256-19 on the surface. If he beats Chardy, he will face an Argentine in the final after 73rd-ranked Horacio Zeballos reached his first ATP semi with victory over fifth seed Albert Ramos. The 27-year-old will play eighth-seeded compatriot Carlos Berlocq, the world No. 81 who lost to Nadal's doubles partner Juan Monaco in last year's final at Vina del Mar. Nadal will be seeking the eighth doubles title of his career when he and Monaco play Italians Paolo Lorenzi and Potito Starace. They progressed with a 6-3 6-4 win over Berlocq and Leonardo Mayer. Meanwhile, Petra Kvitova and Lucie Safarova gave Fed Cup champions the Czech Republic a 2-0 lead over Australia after the first day of their World Group tie in Ostrava on Saturday. Former Wimbledon champion Kvitova beat 168th-ranked Jarmila Gajdosova 7-6 (7-2) 6-3, then world No. 18 Safarova upset No. 9 Samantha Stosur 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-4). Kvitova can put the Czechs into the semifinals by beating former U.S. Open champion Stosur in Sunday's opening reverse singles. Serbia, beaten in last year's final, received a lifeline when Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova retired due to severe cramps when leading 6-4 5-4 against Vesna Dolonc in Nis. Daniela Hantuchova had earlier won 7-5 6-2 against Bojana Jovanovski, elevated to No. 1 in the home Serbian team due to the late withdrawals of former world No. 1s Ana Ivanovic and Jelena Jankovic through injury. Japan and Russia were also tied 1-1 in Moscow, where world No. 57 Ayumi Morita leveled the best-of-five match with a 6-2 6-2 win over 20th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova. Maria Kirilenko, at 13th the highest-ranked player in the first-round tie, won the opening singles rubber 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 against 42-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm. The United States fought back to level at 1-1 against Italy as Varvara Lepchenko beat Roberta Vinci 2-6 6-4 7-5 in Rimini. Last year's French Open finalist Sara Errani defeated 64th-ranked Jamie Hampton 6-2 6-1 in the opening match.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Every so often, grassroots activism succeeds in China. We saw one this week. Caving in to public pressure, government officials in the southwestern city of Shifang in Sichuan Province abandoned plans to build a billion-dollar chemical plant. Plant abandoned amid protests . This came just days after thousands of angry residents took to the streets in protest at the city's bid to build the $1.6 billion Molybdrenum plant. City officials said it had passed all environmental evaluations, but local residents, worried about long-term pollution and health hazards, said ""no."" Defying government and police orders, they marched to the chant of ""Protect Shifang's environment, return our beautiful home!"" Soon enough, the mayor conceded and promised to suspend construction. Then on Friday, the city's Communist Party chief was sacked. ""The people have achieved their goals if their protest was just a NIMBY (not in my backyard) movement,"" the Global Times noted rather acerbically. But some political observers see beyond parochial backyards. ""It is a stunning case of a local NIMBY movement coalescing with the support of nationwide public opinion through the internet,"" said Xiao Qiang, a U.S.-based expert on the Chinese internet. ""The new media, particularly through (Twitter-like) Weibo and popular forums such as Kaidi.net played an absolutely critical role in the whole process."" Xiao said netizens spread the news instantly and widely, exposed police violence against protesters and generated popular outrage. ""With such national exposure and public opinion on the protesters' side, the local authorities had no choice but to cave in instantly,"" he said. A few other NIMBY protesters have succeeded in China. In 2009, local residents rallied and aborted a government plan to build a waste incinerator plant in a suburban town in southern Guangzhou city. That same year, Shanghai residents foiled a city plan to construct a high-speed train line using magnetic levitation technology complete with a raised concrete track. Last August, thousands of protesters forced officials in the northeastern port city of Dalian to shut down and promise to relocate a controversial chemical plant that produced paraxylene (PX), which residents feared was carcinogenic. Political observers attribute these successes to smart tactics. ""The environment is a perfect issue for the public to exploit the central-local divide,"" said Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at the University of Iowa in the U.S. ""People know when to claim their right to resist the local government by using central government regulations,"" Tang explained. ""Beijing is often sympathetic to such public demand since it does not hurt its own legitimacy. Scholars describe this tactic as the 'rightful resistance.'"" This is best exemplified by one of the Shifang protesters' banners: ""Long live the Communist Party, kick out the copper factory!"" But China has been grappling with a spike in social unrest. Anger has been rising over land seizures, a growing wealth divide, official corruption and environmental pollution. Rural unrest is also a problem, though nothing new. In the early 1990s, I covered a farmers' protest in Sichuan over unpopular taxation policies. But what is new is the increased scope and frequency of the protests. They have now spread to towns and cities. Another new factor is the Weibo phenomenon. The hugely popular micro-blogging service now has more than 300 million subscribers who post about 100 million tweets every day. Despite government censorship, Weibo is tearing down walls that block the free flow of information. Government censors cannot completely stop Weibo users from downloading and forwarding news and views via Weibo. When Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist, escaped house arrest and took refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, sustained public attention on Weibo helped put pressure on Chinese and American officials to seek a diplomatic solution. ""The spotlight makes a huge difference,"" said Gregory Lee, a professor at the University of Lyon in France. ""The Chen Guangcheng case was dealt with in reaction of media attention."" Chen Guangcheng on his next move . Chen has since been allowed to leave and study in the U.S. When these unsavory events break, most official Chinese media are usually tight-lipped, or are careful to provide information following the official lines. ""It is worth pointing out that while the official media kept its usual silence during the entire time, there was very little online censorship applied on this event, at least in the first couple of days,"" said Xiao. Xiao thinks the censors' apparent inaction could be because pictures and protest messages spread too fast for the censors to control; or it could be a deliberate decision by censors in Beijing because it involves a local environmental issue. The University of Iowa's Tang says it is not uncommon nowadays for local governments to give in to demands on issues like the environment and labor rights -- but not on core issues. ""I doubt if the local government would compromise so easily had it been a protest for ethnic autonomy in Tibet,"" he said. Is official tolerance and compromise now the new normal? Not necessarily, observers agree. ""If the central authorities are determined to suppress the information and opposition voices, they can still contain the scale of public awareness,"" said Xiao, founder of China Digital Times, a U.S.-based bilingual website on China. ""Collective demonstrations will occur over and over but the authorities will still seek to deal with them oppressively where they can,"" added Lee, author of ""China's Lost Decade,"" which looks at China's Cultural Revolution. But Xiao says local officials can learn a lesson or two from this week's Shifang episode. ""They should learn that when facing massive demonstrations, using brutal force can have the opposite result than intended, especially in the internet age, since there is risk that violence will be exposed quickly in front of the whole nation.""","Government officials in southwestern city of Shifang abandoned plans to build a chemical plant .
The decision followed concerted pressure from thousands of angry local residents .
Analysts say internet allowed tales of police abuse to filter out, generating widespread anger .
But other observers warn China will crack down on protests when they can ."
"(CNN) -- Bubba Watson won the 76th U.S. Masters as he beat South African Louis Oosthuizen at the second hole of a sudden death playoff at Augusta National on Sunday. Watson, who won his first major title, played a remarkable recovery shot from the trees at the 10th to find the green. Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, saw his par putt miss to leave his American opponent with two shots to take the title. Golf.com: Watson's magnificent shot . The 33-year-old Watson rolled his first to within six inches before completing the task, bursting into tears as he embraced his mother, Mollie, by the side of the green. ""I never got this far in my dreams,"" said Watson as he prepared to don the famous green jacket, won last year by Oosthuizen's fellow South African Charl Schwartzel. Watson and his wife have recently adopted their first child and he added: ""To go home to my new son is going to be fun."" The playoff pair had finished tied at 10-under 278 in regulation play, as Watson produced a burst of four straight birdies on the back nine to draw level with his playing partner. Oosthuizen had taken control of the tournament when he holed his second shot at the par-5 second hole for a remarkable three-under-par double-eagle, only the fourth in the history of the Masters. Oosthuizen makes history on No. 2 . But he mixed two bogeys with two birdies to give Watson the chance to force a playoff, his second in a major after losing to Martin Kaymer of Germany at the 2010 U.S. PGA Championship. First-round leader Lee Westwood of England, home pair Matt Kuchar and Phil Mickelson, and overnight leader Peter Hanson of Sweden finished tied for third at eight-under 280. Mickelson's challenge was disrupted by a triple bogey six at the short fourth and he was never able to get on terms in search of his fourth Masters crown as he finished with a level-par 72. Hanson also struggled early in his round before a late rally. Up ahead, world No. 3 Westwood, once again immaculate from tee to green, carded a four-under 68 to set the clubhouse pace in search of his first major crown and was joined on that mark by local favorite Kuchar. But Oosthuizen and Watson kept their nerve, parring both the 17th and 18th to stay locked together at 10 under par to go into the extra holes. Two of the pre-tournament favorites, Tiger Woods and Northern Ireland's world No. 2 Rory McIlroy, finished tied together at five over, 15 shots adrift after final rounds of 74 and 76 respectively.","Bubba Watson wins the 76th U.S. Masters at Augusta for his first major title .

"Beijing (CNN) -- ""Does this mean I must now carry my passport everyday?"" my wife Ana wondered aloud with a mix of bemusement and exasperation. She was reacting to news reports that Beijing had started a 100-day campaign to ""clean out"" expatriates illegally living or working in the Chinese capital. Until the end of August the Beijing Public Security Bureau has decreed that all resident foreigners are expected to show their passports for ""spot checks"" of visas and resident permits. Hinting at stern measures for violators, a campaign poster features an image of a giant fist. Police have conducted a sweep of communities where expatriates frequently congregate, like the university belt and the Sanlitun district of the city, which boasts an eclectic array of shops, restaurants and bars. But finding violators may not be easy. There are almost 200,000 foreign residents in Beijing on short-term or long-term visas, according to the Beijing Morning Post, which quotes police sources. Mood darkens amid crackdown on 'illegal foreigners' The campaign has enlisted the help of the Chinese public, who can call a telephone hotline to report ""suspicious foreigners."" Violators will be fined, detained or even deported. However, the crackdown has made the expat community in Beijing uneasy, with many wondering why the authorities have decided to take action now. China watchers wonder whether this is simply a preemptive measure to ensure security and stability months before the Communist Party hold its once-a-decade leadership transition later this year. A similar sweep was conducted several months before Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics. Others see the high profile campaign as yet another hint of the xenophobic tendencies in the ""Middle Kingdom."" Days before the police campaign commenced, shocking videos purportedly showing a British national sexually abusing a Chinese woman went viral on cyberspace. It prompted an avalanche of angry posts on social-networking sites. Soon after the campaign was announced, Chinese TV anchor Yang Rui poured gasoline onto the fire when he posted scornful comments on his microblog calling for the expulsion of ""foreign scum."" Some observers say China has good reason to go after law-breaking foreigners. ""The crackdown makes sense in the light of the large number of illegal migrants that have made it into China, some of whom may have been involved in illegal or violent activities,"" said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University's Department of Science and Technology. But he said foreigners should be treated fairly and equally, according to law. Crucially, the crackdown seems to be popular with many ordinary Chinese. ""Of course we should send home those foreigners who have entered illegally, just as we Chinese won't be allowed in other countries without legal documents,"" one Beijing resident told CNN. ""To be a strong nation, you need not just a good economy but also strong diplomatic policies,"" said another. ""That shows a nation's self-respect and dignity."" Another resident was more blunt: ""China as a big nation should get tougher. We've been too soft for too long."" As China's economic and military might grow, the people's pride and nationalistic feelings rise. There's nothing wrong with promoting patriotism, experts say, but they warn against chauvinism. ""The Chinese have to be careful about underlying chauvinism which can lead them to behave inappropriately towards foreigners in the country, and in their foreign policy,"" said Zweig. During the last century, China experienced how nationalism led to xenophobia during the Boxer Rebellion in the early 1900s -- when groups of peasants banded together to rid the country of foreign influences -- and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when Mao Zedong attempted to reassert revolutionary values in China by purging what he described as bourgeois influences. No one wants to experience xenophobia. I have seen how ugly it can be. Like most foreigners who lived in China in the 1970s, I saw a closed, xenophobic society riddled with ingrained racial stereotypes. Foreigners in Beijing were virtually quarantined. While we enjoyed special privileges, such as access to special ""friendship stores"", train compartments, hospital wards and beach resorts, we were cut off from spontaneous contact with ordinary people. Diplomats and journalists were segregated in gated ""foreigners' compounds"", which we use to call foreign ghettos. Local residents resented such special treatment. They often targeted foreigners with scorn and disdain. Foreigners were disparagingly referred ""waiguo guizi"" (foreign devils). Although infrequent, I do remember an anti-foreign backlash that led to occasional altercations and even rioting. To be sure, China has changed significantly since Deng Xiaoping launched his market reform and open-door policies in 1978. Over the years it has gradually integrated into the global village through diplomacy, trade, tourism, academic exchanges and the media. But some expatriates in Beijing still detect anti-foreign tendencies. ""I find it difficult to understand why resentment is aimed at foreigners in general rather than at those who break the law or behave badly, regardless of nationality,"" said one. ""There is definitely an issue of Chinese having stereotypical views on foreigners, and a very clear us-versus-them attitude,"" said another. Neither person wished to be identified. China scholars believe many Chinese still harbor racist tendencies and lack the open-minded tradition of self-reflection when they feel or express such views. ""This lack of self-reflection,"" Zweig opined, ""allows for anti-foreignism to lurk under the surface."" That partly explains why, in its long and checkered history, China has capriciously swung from a sentimental love-affair with things foreign to angry rejection -- and back again. Is xenophobia rearing its head again? ""This is not xenophobia,"" a recent China Daily editorial stated. ""It is people's desire to live in a civilized society. Our government is under an obligation to make sure citizens live in a law-abiding country. The ongoing action against illegal immigration in no way compromises our hospitality to foreign guests."" That is the kind of reassurance that expatriates in China badly need.","Beijing started campaign to ""clean out"" expatriates illegally living or working in Chinese capital .

"(CNN) -- Twenty tourists, including two Americans, are stuck on a chunk of ice drifting in the Canadian Arctic, Canadian officials said Tuesday. The group was on an expedition in the Canadian territory of Nunavut when the ice that they were on broke away from shore, according to Yvonne Niego of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The ice floe has since drifted about 2 miles, the Canadian Coast Guard said. No one was hurt, nor are the tourists in any imminent danger, according to Major Steve Neta of the Royal Canadian Air Force, which is assisting in the rescue. But, he said, the ice floe is beginning to show signs of deterioration. A rescue mission is currently under way, but the location is so extreme that helicopters won't arrive until at least Wednesday morning, according to the Canadian Coast Guard. Survival kits were dropped Tuesday from airplanes to the floating refugees, whose names have not been released. It's currently about 35 degrees Fahrenheit where they are. The tour company, Canadian-based Arctic Kingdom Polar Expeditions, declined to comment when reached by CNN Tuesday night.","20 tourists are trapped on chunk of ice in the Canadian Arctic .

"(CNN) -- Just when it seems all rivers have been charted, seas explored and canals crossed, secret backwaters move into the limelight. While cruise companies have traditionally focused on more popular circuits, increasing attention is being paid to off-the-radar bodies of water. Cruise providers are noticing an uptick in enthusiasm for offbeat boating. Orient-Express Trains & Cruises is adding its second ship to river itineraries in burgeoning Myanmar (also known as Burma ). ""Our decision to introduce our newest river cruiser, Orcaella, in July 2013 is evidence of our commitment to Myanmar, one of the few places yet to be fully discovered,"" says managing director Gary Franklin. ""So we wish to use our experience to delve farther off the beaten track."" Travel photos you wish you'd taken . Micato Safaris, which offers bespoke tours to India, has seen a recent spike in inquiries about river cruising in the country's southern state of Kerala. ""Cruising Kerala's backwaters provides a wonderful contrast to the hustle and bustle of India's cities,"" says managing director Dennis Pinto. ""A sail through reveals a serene and peaceful world, where one can observe the quieter lifestyles of the villagers who make their living in these resource-rich backwaters."" There is something to be said for drifting along uncharted waterways and quietly observing the shores. The silent distance adds a special touch to a voyage, whether it separates you from the African bush or picturesque Swedish landscape. It also comes as no surprise that many of these waterways are quickly morphing from secretive to spotlighted—such as Myanmar's Irrawaddy River—while others remain rarely plied. Bon voyage. Departures: Cruising the Mediterranean . Amazon River, Peru . While the Amazon River is not a secret, many of its tributaries are. Aqua Expeditions does three-, four- and seven-night cruises on M/V Aqua and M/V Aria, two boutique river vessels that travel deep into the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve at the headwaters of the Amazon. Tour the jungle town of Iquitos before plying the untouched waters of the Maranon, Ucayali and Yanallpa rivers. Experience piranha fishing and walks through the rainforest to spot playful monkeys or relax on the rooftop deck and view neon-brilliant birds and rare pink dolphins. Panoramic windows wrap around the large design suites; Peruvian-European fusion fare is served onboard. Prices start at $2,685; 866-603-3687. Chobe River, Namibia and Botswana . Few experiences match the thrill of a river safari along the Chobe River between Botswana and Namibia on the five-star Zambezi Queen. The cruiser provides an ideal vantage point from which to view the African grasslands and the river itself, which teems with hippos and crocodiles. Private balconies connect each of the 14 cabins to the outdoors and a contemporary dining room showcases three-sided views. After an exhilarating game drive, travel in a traditional mokoro canoe to visit local villages for a boma dinner, with a barbecue and dance performance under the stars. Sip a sundowner cocktail by the onboard pool while observing elephants, leopards, lions and buffalo along the riverbank. Prices start at $905 (two nights). Departures: Sailing the Aeolian Islands .

Irrawaddy River, Myanmar . Winding down the Irrawaddy, the scenic waterway that cuts right through Myanmar, is the most serene way to explore the Golden Land. Relive the journey in Rudyard Kipling's poem ""On the Road to Mandalay"" aboard Orient-Express' luxury Road to Mandalay cruiser, with three- to 11-night trips. Get a bird's-eye view of this forgotten land on a hot-air-balloon ride over the ancient kingdom of Bagan or see lacquerware being made. Unwind with a soothing east meets west massage and savor mohinga, the region's staple fish soup. Orient-Express is adding a second ship on the Irrawaddy River in July—the 50-guest Orcaella will take to the more remote sections of western Myanmar along the Chindwin River toward the Indian border. Prices start at $2,520. Kerala Backwaters, India . For a unique ramble through the backwaters of Kerala, a southern Indian state that edges the Arabian Sea, pick a two- or three-night itinerary on The Oberoi Motor Vessel Vrinda.

"(CNN) -- ""The Sopranos"" made him a star, but James Gandolfini's rise to fame began with a small student film from 1989. Playing a pimp named Mike, the tough guy role was the New Jersey native's screen debut. Gandolfini didn't get paid for the performance in ""Eddy,"" but he left a lasting impression on the director David Matalon. ""He was really intense and always prepared on set,"" said Matalon, who made the movie for a mere $10,000 as a student at New York University. ""He was really focused. And he really loved acting. You can see he was a guy that was very conscious of the work."" ""Eddy"" was a modern-day film noir, in which the title character falls for a working girl named Marge. When they decide to run away together, Gandolfini's Mike kills Eddy and accidentally shoots Marge as well. Gandolfini was 27 and working as a doorman at the time, said Matalon. He cast Gandolfini after interviewing about 15 actors for the part. ""None of them were very convincing and threatening,"" Matalon recalled, ""and then he just had it. ""He came in, and the girl helping me do the movie, he started doing the monologue, and she was crouching behind me and I said 'as far as I'm concerned, you got the part.' "" Matalon remembered the moment Gandolfini walked onto the set for the first time. ""This giant scary guy shows up in the elevator. He was really in shape, really ripped. There's a scene when he throws the guy off camera and in reality, he threw the guy so far into the air he went up and hit the ground."" It would be four years before Gandolfini appeared in ""True Romance,"" his first major Hollywood film role, and a full decade before ""The Sopranos"" turned him into a television icon. But back in 1989, the imposing young actor was just starting out on a career that came to a end last week with his death at 51. ""He was a great guy,"" said Matalon, who is an accomplished screenwriter, producer and filmmaker. ""You could see there's a slight dangerousness in him. It kept it exciting, but he never let it overcome his professionalism."" Gandolfini funeral set for Thursday .

"(CNN) -- From Alcatraz and the Birdman to Old Melbourne Gaol where Ned Kelly was hanged, from Robben Island in Capetown where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated to Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin where the leaders of the Easter Uprising were executed, decommissioned prisons and their sinister histories have become intriguing destinations for travelers. 1. Alcatraz, United States . Spanish explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala named it Isla de los Alcatraces (Isle of the Pelicans), which might suggest something of a modern pleasure resort. Think again. As the watchtower comes into view we're reminded that this was the grim maximum security prison of Alcatraz. Inmates included mob czar Al Capone, bank robber George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly and Robert Stroud, ""The Birdman"" of Hollywood movie fame. Visitors can listen to the audio tour while inspecting the cells or in the deserted exercise yard and learn about the Indian occupation from 1969-71, carried out in part to press their land claims. To enhance the experience, you can research beforehand. What was it like? Former inmate, the late Jim Quillen, said it all: . ""You were a number, you weren't a name. I wasn't Jim Quillen. Hell, I was Number 586, and nobody wanted that."" San Francisco Bay; www.alcatrazcruises.com . 2. Old Melbourne Gaol, Australia . Built in the mid-1800s when the Victorian gold rushes created a crime surge, Old Melbourne Gaol held petty offenders, homeless people and the mentally ill as well as dangerous criminals. It saw 133 executions. The most famous was the bushranger Ned Kelly, hanged in 1880 for the murders of three police officers. One of his death masks is on display here. Though closed as a prison in 1929, it wasn't until 1972 that the site was taken over by the National Trust. Visitors can now take self-guided tours to see what prison life was like or go on organized ghost tours for a different perspective. 377 Russell St., Melbourne; www.oldmelbournegaol.com.au . Also on CNN: 15 macabre crime-inspired tours . 3. Devil's Island, French Guiana . Off the coast of French Guiana in South America, the Îles du Salut island group was an infamous French penal colony from 1852 to 1953. Excursions may go only to Île Royale, where wardens and staff lived, which has some prison cells and now a hotel and restaurant. But the Journey Latin America tour includes a Zodiac ride to Île Saint-Joseph, to see the solitary confinement cells, now encroached upon by jungle. The third island is the one actually called Île du Diable, or in English -- Devil's Island. Political prisoner, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, was kept here and the island was the subject of the escape tale, Papillon. Surrounded by shark-infested waters and strong cross-currents, landing on the legendary island is no longer permitted, though it's clearly seen only 200 meters away from Île Royale. By boat, 15 kilometers north of Kourou, French Guiana; Tours: longer and local day tours . 4. Oxford Castle, England . Built in 1071 by a Norman baron, Oxford Castle was used by King Charles as a prison for rebel Parliamentarians in the English Civil War. After serving as a prison for hundreds of years, it ceased that role in 1996. In 2004, the site was redeveloped to include flats, restaurants, an art gallery and more, but key parts of the prison were preserved. Now ""Oxford Castle -- Unlocked"" offers guided tours that let visitors experience the austere 18th-century Debtors' Tower and Prison D-wing, feel the oppressive atmosphere of the 900-year-old underground Crypt and climb the Saxon St. George's Tower for 360-degree views over the historic city of Oxford. 44 New Road, Oxford; www.oxfordcastleunlocked.co.uk . 5. Horsens State Prison, Denmark . After 153 years the gates of Horsens State Prison slammed shut for the last time in 2006. The foundation FÆNGSLET now runs the cultural institution in these imposing buildings, which house the Prison Museum and various conference and business facilities. There are even large concerts here during the year. On a tour of the prison, visitors hear stories of former inmates like Jens Nielsen, who so hated being incarcerated that he tried three times to kill a warden and get the death penalty. His execution in 1892 was to be Denmark's last, with the executioner chopping off Nielsen's head at a single blow. The axe is still here for all to see. Fængslet, Fussingsvej 8, DK-8700 Horsens; www.faengslet.dk . 6. Eastern State Penitentiary, United States . From its opening in 1829, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia was controversial for its system of total solitary confinement. After his visit in 1842 Charles Dickens wrote: ""The System is rigid, strict and hopeless ... and I believe it to be cruel and wrong."" Closed in 1970, the prison has become a major tourist attraction. Unlike the first tours in 1994, when visitors wore hard hats, there's now an audio tour narrated by actor Steve Buscemi that lets the curious explore behind the grim, castle-like walls, listening to former guards and inmates describe life at Eastern State. And at night? Terror Behind the Walls is one totally haunted attraction. 2027 Fairmount Ave., Philadelphia; www.easternstate.org . 7. Kilmainham Gaol, Ireland . When it opened in 1796, Dublin's Kilmainham Gaol functioned as the county prison and for much of its time housed common prisoners, including 4,000 thereafter transported to Australia. But the place became a symbol of Irish nationalism because so many who rebelled against British rule were imprisoned and executed here, including those involved in the uprisings and wars of 1916, 1919-21 and 1922-24. The last man to walk free when it was decommissioned as a prison in 1924, Eamon de Valera, went on to become Prime Minister of Ireland. Guided tours are available and include an audio-visual show. A major exhibition details the political and penal history of the prison and its restoration. Inchicore Road, Kilmainham, Dublin 8; www.heritageireland.ie . Also on CNN: Insider Guide: Best of Dublin . 8. Port Arthur, Australia . The UNESCO World Heritage listed Port Arthur Historic Site is where a colonial prison settlement operated on the island of Tasmania from 1830 till 1877. The ruined buildings are reminders of the harsh life convicts faced. This is, however, one prison where the dead are central to the tourist experience. Boat tours go out to the Isle of the Dead, where only 180 of the 1646 graves recorded to exist are marked, those being prison staff and military personnel. Lantern-lit ghost tours have long been popular, but more recently another dimension has been added, with the scientifically run, adults-only Paranormal Investigation Experience using professional test equipment to try and detect the presence of ghosts and other paranormal activity. Arthur Highway, Port Arthur, Tasmania; www.portarthur.org.au . 9. Hostel Celica, Slovenia, and others . While refurbishment has changed the dread appearance of some one-time prisons, it's created a quirky accommodation option -- spend a night in the cells! The former military prison in Ljubljana, Slovenia, for instance, has morphed into the colorful Hostel Celica, where 20 former cells have been revamped by artists into unique digs for travelers. Similarly, Hostelling International has two hostels located in renovated prisons, enabling guests to explore the history of the building and also stay in a cell -- but with a key. In Sweden Langholmen Hostel is located in the former Crown Remand Prison, while in Canada the Carleton County Jail is now the Ottawa Jail Hostel. Hostel Celica, Metelkova 8, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; +386 1 230 9700; www.hostelcelica.com . Langholmen Hostel, Långholmsmuren 20 Kronohäktet 11733 Stockholm; +46 8 720 8500 . Ottawa Jail Hostel, 75 Nicholas St., K1N 7B9 Ottawa; +1 613 235 2595 . 10. Robben Island, South Africa . Off the coast from Cape Town, Robben Island's time as a maximum security prison meant that its infamy was assured. Political prisoners, especially anti-apartheid campaigners, were sent to Robben Island, the most famous being Nelson Mandela, who spent 18 of his 27 years of imprisonment there. He described it as ""without question the harshest, most iron-fisted outpost of the South African penal system."" Mandela went on to become president of a democratic South Africa. Robben Island is World Heritage listed because it bears witness to ""the triumph of democracy and freedom over oppression and racism."" The standard tour to Robben Island is three and a half hours long, including the ferry rides, and is guided by a former political prisoner.

"Beijing (CNN) -- China on Thursday launched its first space laboratory module, marking another step upward for its space program. ""We must soberly recognize that China's space-station technology is still in its initial stage, compared to those of the U.S. and Russia,"" said a commentary from the state-run Xinhua News Agency. ""But the launch of Tiangong-1 is the beginning of China's efforts to narrow the gap."" China-watchers agree. ""The test reflects China's technological advances, funded by its rapid economic growth and facilitated by the military's ballistic missile program,"" says Taylor Fravel, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The unmanned space-lab is an 8-ton module named Tiangong-1, or ""Heavenly Palace."" That's what the Chinese called outer space in ancient times. Tiangong-1 is designed to stay in space for two years and is expected to dock with an unmanned spacecraft in November. China launches first space docking mission . The rendezvous next month will be the true test of the mission, experts say. ""Docking is necessary for the development of a space station, which is China's long-term objective,"" says Fravel. China needs to master this docking technique to be able to build its own manned space station by around 2020. It also hopes to send a man to the moon and even explore Mars, bringing it in the same league as the United States as a superpower in space. For Beijing, this week's launch is more than a space mission. It is meant to boost national pride and prestige. ""It is no coincidence that the launch of Tiangong-1 occurs just before October 1,"" says MIT's Fravel, referring to China's National Day holiday, when the People's Republic was officially established in 1949. ""I am very proud of our space program,"" exudes a visitor at Beijing Planetarium. ""Spending on the space program is very necessary to advance science and technology in our country,"" says another. China also hopes to reap other benefits. Space missions, experts say, spur technological and scientific breakthroughs in such fields as electronics, computer, engineering, materials and other industries. There are military and electronic-intelligence applications too. And of course, the economic dividends are lucrative. Glitch-less space launches are a publicity bonanza for China's satellite-launch industry, which is already a huge money-making business. China's modern-day space ambitions date back to 1970, when it catapulted the country's first satellite into orbit. I remember how over the years the Chinese proudly spoke of that breakthrough, bragging that the small space module even transmitted the revolutionary tune ""East Is Red"" as it circled the Earth. But hardly anyone considered China as a serious player in space exploration. Over the years, China has been catching up, pumping enormous sums of money and resources into research and training. ""In the early 1990s, President Jiang Zemin gave the go-ahead for a manned space program and the decision set off a tremendous construction boom that was in some ways as impressive as NASA's buildup for the Apollo project in the 1960s,"" writes James Oberg in his book ""China's Great Leap Upward"". In 2003, China's first astronaut, Colonel Yang Liwei, orbited the Earth in a Chinese-made Shenzhou capsule before landing to a hero's welcome. Yang's voyage into space -- called ""taikong"" in Chinese -- gave birth to the new word ""taikonaut."" Only China, Russia and the United States have sent men into space. In 2004, I joined a group of journalists visiting the Jiuquan Space Center, where taikonaut Yang and the Tiangong-1 blasted off. It was the first time Chinese officials had allowed international journalists into the sprawling top-secret launch center. China's equivalent of Cape Canaveral is an unpretentious cluster of white buildings and towers, tucked in northwestern China's vast Gobi desert. We were forbidden from taking pictures of the command-and-control center but we were shown around the center's facilities, including the launch towers and silos, an Olympic-sized swimming pool and the taikonauts' austere apartments. Might the Chinese become the new space leaders of the 21st century? They just might. China is forging ahead to build its own space station, even though the costs would be enormous, while the U.S. and other space powers have apparently discarded that option. China is not part of the International Space Station (ISS), which currently orbits the Earth while space experts and astronauts conduct experiments in a range of fields, from physics to astronomy. The ISS is a consortium among NASA, Russia's RKA space agency, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the Canadian CSA. The ISS is expected to be phased out in the future. China is now on track to build its own space station. ""This is not to say that China will never cooperate with others in space, but it would prefer to do so from a position of strength once it has developed a more capable and robust space program,"" says MIT's Fravel, who specializes in China's military affairs. Should China's competitors worry about its steady strides? ""The U.S. should not be too worried, at least not yet,"" Fravel says. ""Tiangong has been likened to the Gemini program conducted by the U.S. 50 years ago."" Still, the upward trajectory of China's space program seems to point in its favor.","China launches space lab module Tiangong-1, which means ""heavenly palace""

The company is reported to be preparing to file for an IPO -- initial public offering -- through which anyone will be able to buy shares of the social networking company on an open stock exchange. As a media theorist, I used to ignore these business shenanigans. Who cares if these companies are private or public, profitable or in the red? How many non-Wall-Street-Journal readers even knew what an IPO was back before the Internet created the likes of AOL, Netscape, and Google? But the fact is we do now think about the stock market. Many of us are aware that Apple's market capitalization is fast approaching half a trillion dollars, making it either the largest or second-largest company in the world behind Exxon Mobil - depending on the week. So when we hear that Facebook is preparing for an IPO that will likely dwarf Google's entrance to the public markets in 2004, particularly considering that the company doesn't sell tangible goods or services in the traditional sense, we can't help but wonder what this will mean for the future of Facebook, its users, its competitors, and the greater economy. The way it appears at first glance - particularly for those who have been following Mr. Zuckerberg since he launched ""The Facebook"" from his college dorm or, better, those who have seen the movie ""The Social Network"" - is that the Zuckerberg juggernaut is continuing unabated. This new form of media -- social networking -- will not only redefine the Internet, change human relationships, create a new marketing landscape, and challenge Google, but it will now rescue and alter the economy itself. Like virtual kudzu, it will infiltrate the financial markets, creating new sorts of opportunities for this peer-to-peer ""social"" economy to take root. We will all make our living playing Farmville, or designing new versions of it, or investing in companies that do. In reality, however, I don't think we are witnessing Facebook's victory over the financial markets as much as its acquiescence to them. Yes, Apple challenged Microsoft for software supremacy, just as Facebook now challenges Google for Internet supremacy. But there's another operating system churning away beneath all this high tech activity, and it's called corporate capitalism. If a company is big enough -- and that means simply holding enough money -- then sooner or later that money influences the rest of the company's activities. In Facebook's case, it meant approaching the legal limit of 500 investors, which triggers a requirement to open the books to regulatory scrutiny. It also meant dealing with a few thousand coveted employees who took jobs at Facebook instead of Google or Apple or anywhere else because they were hoping to get in on a big thing. The promise of cashing in a few million dollars worth of stock options helps many a programmer make it through a late night of coding. The same goes for those who invested in Zuckerberg five or more years ago and want to cash in before the ""social web"" bubble pops, if it's going to. Facebook was taking so long to get to market that many people had begun selling their shares privately on what are known as secondary markets, putting Facebook's valuation even further out of the company's own hands. Simply becoming a multi-billion-dollar company changes the essence of its goals, activities, and purpose. Its bloodstream becomes filled with cash, and cash has its own agenda. For just like print, TV, or the Internet, money is a medium, too. It has biases, or tendencies, programmed right into it. The kind of money we happen to use -- bank-issued central currency -- is biased toward lending. That's why we call our system ""capitalism."" It's about the capital: Our money is designed to favor those who lend it to others who actually use it to build companies or create value. The more money a company takes in, the more obligated it becomes to function in accordance with the properties and rules of money. For example, since becoming public, Google has had to prove its devotion to its shareholders' interests by cutting pet programs, showing earnings' growth, and demonstrating focus over big dreams. Out with public experiments like Google Labs, in with products like Android try to compete with Apple's iOS and G+ to compete with Facebook. No more touting that employees get 20% of their work hours to do whatever they want. It's a real corporation, now, and has to behave like one. By all accounts, Zuckerberg was trying to delay this eventuality as long as possible. He knows that becoming the CEO of a public company will not be nearly as much fun, or as free, as running an Internet startup. However much we may not like his vision for our future, his primary purpose was to change the world. He wanted to create the operating system on which human social activity took place. What he has ultimately succumbed to, however, is the fact that Facebook was running on top of another operating system all along. Instead of revolutionizing our reality, by filing an IPO Mark Zuckerberg is finally getting with the program. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Four Tibetans set themselves on fire Wednesday to protest Chinese rule ahead, hours before a key gathering of Communist Party's leaders in Beijing. At least two of the protesters died, said the Tibetan government in exile in India, citing sources on the ground. Rights group Free Tibet says the four self-immolations represent the highest number of such incidents in one day. Hours later, Chinese leaders gathered Thursday for the Communist Party's 18th National Congress in Beijing. The days-long gathering will usher in a new set of leaders of the world's most populous nation. After a decade in power, Chinese President Hu Jintao is expected to hand over the party's top job to Vice President Xi Jinping. One of the dead Wednesday was a 15-year-old monk, who set himself alight with two other monks in a majority Tibetan region of Sichuan Province, said the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. They cried ""freedom for Tibet"" and for the ""return of the Dalai Lama."" The other two monks, both 16, were hospitalized. The boys were from the same monastery in Ngaba county, where CNN has reported a number of such incidents in the past. In a separate incident, a 23-year-old woman died after setting herself on fire in Rebkong county (Tongren county in Chinese), which is in the Qinghai Province, said exile Tibetan government spokesman Penpa Tsering in Dharamsala, India. Self-immolation is a common form of protest for Tibetans who want genuine autonomy from China and accuse Beijing of repression. China began a gradual occupation of Tibet in the 1950's. Tibet's leader, the Dalai Lama, fled for India in 1959 after a failed uprising, and many ethnic Tibetans followed him. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression of Tibetans, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. It makes centuries-old historical claims on the region. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi and Eve Bower from Atlanta.","Two of the protesters die .

"(CNN) -- When Facebook's 27-year-old CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, wore a hoodie at a presentation to investors during the lead-up to Facebook's initial public offering, a financial analyst publicly accused Zuckerberg of immaturity. By dressing casually at such an important event, he alleged, Zuckerberg was telling potential shareholders they didn't matter. The blogosphere's response was swift: Business and tech commentators across the nation rushed to the billionaire's defense, explaining that the hooded sweatshirt was a symbol of his independent-mindedness, his youth, his authenticity, his loyalty to the culture of Silicon Valley. They argued his business acumen is reflected in Facebook's numbers, not in his fashion choices. Now that the firestorm has cooled, it's worth taking a moment to consider the complex significance of the hoodie for someone like Zuckerberg. Life on Planet Facebook . In one respect, both the anti-hoodie and pro-hoodie factions are correct. When Zuckerberg wears a hoodie at a high-profile meeting, he's saying: I am an artist, not a salesman. Salesmen wear suits because their job is to persuade, seduce, cajole; appearance is all-important. And the salesman's first priority is profit, which, if you're a Facebook shareholder, is the ethos you might wish to see in the CEO of the company you're investing in. But Zuckerberg has said explicitly he is devoted above all to his beautiful creation: Facebook. This, presumably, is why he turned down Yahoo's offer of $1 billion for the company back in its early years and chose to keep running the company himself. He's first and foremost an inventor, a tinkerer in a workshop, a monk in hooded robes. Sales, the bottom line, these are not the things that define me, the hoodie says. To a tech geek, indifference to dress is a badge of pride because any creative endeavor, whether it's coding software or writing novels, goes better if you can forget about yourself entirely, forget about how you look, what you're wearing, how people perceive you. Your must immerse yourself in your art. It must become the only thing on your mind. Timeline: Mark Zuckerberg's rise from child prodigy to Facebook billionaire . The nerd's spastic movements, childlike laugh, checked-out eyes as she codes or writes or thinks are the symptoms of a person obsessed with work, a person unconscious of herself and the impression she's making. That's why Bill Gates used to dress like a homeless guy, and Steve Jobs wore a black turtleneck, why Zuckerberg wears the hoodie. It's about taking pride in being an artist. Hoodie's evolution from fashion mainstay to symbol of injustice . So the analyst who said the hoodie shows I-don't-give-a-damn attitude was right in one sense, but he was wrong to suggest Zuckerberg's hoodie was bad news for Facebook investors. Because showing the world that you're an artist instead of a salesman can be a great sales tactic. As a cub reporter, I had the privilege of watching Steve Jobs pitch the Pixar movie ""Monsters, Inc."" to a handful of journalists in a small room. It was the best sales presentation I've ever seen. While it was happening, I wanted to do anything Jobs asked, because he was able to seem like he didn't care what we thought of him. He was unshaven, wearing his cat-burglar ensemble. He never tried to kiss up to any of us, like movie people often did. There were no visual aids, no refreshments. He just fulminated about what a good movie it was, how major its advances in animation technology, almost as if we weren't there. Are you living without Facebook? He was a brilliant salesman because he didn't act much like a salesman. You believed him because he didn't seem like he cared that much whether you believed him or not. He was a good-looking, confident person, but his conduct in many respects was that of somebody so passionate about his work that it made him just a little socially unacceptable. This guy is a nerd, you thought -- the real thing, so he must know what he's talking about. Zuckerberg has learned much, I suspect, from Jobs. He knows the impression he makes is important, so, like Jobs, he acts like he doesn't think it's important. The hoodie is both who he really is -- a big nerd -- and a thoughtful executive's performance of who he really is. He isn't being immature or youthful at all. He's striving to earn the confidence of investors by presenting himself as a scruffy genius who doesn't care about earning their confidence. And that's good business. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Nugent.","Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was criticized for wearing a hoodie in meeting .

"(CNN) -- Thursday sees the start of the most intense major golf championship of them all: the U.S. Open, played this year on the East Course at Merion Golf Club just outside of Philadelphia. The tournament is recognized as the most challenging major by golf professionals and fans alike -- the winning score is frequently over par, the rough is normally grown to penal lengths and the greens are normally extremely tough to putt on. If you're a golf fanatic, no doubt you'd love to play on some of these U.S. Open courses to see how you score compared to the world's best. Unfortunately, the U.S. Open is mostly played at private clubs such as Merion -- you can't play on these courses unless you're lucky enough to be or know a member. However, six public courses already have or will host the U.S. Open. The great news is that anyone can play them as long as they can afford the green fee. Bethpage Black Course, Farmingdale, New York . Bethpage Black, the toughest of five courses at Bethpage State Park on Long Island, joined the U.S. Open roster in 2002 after the U.S. Golf Association decided to bring its flagship tournament to a public venue. The experiment proved such a success that the U.S. Open was again held at Bethpage Black in 2009. Golf Digest ranked the course No. 42 on its 2013 list of America's 100 greatest courses. Tiger Woods won the first U.S. Open held at Bethpage Black in 2002. Lucas Glover took the 2009 event. Anyone can play this monster 7,468-yard, par 71 course. Be advised that this is a walking-only course, and there's a sign near the first tee that reads ""WARNING: The Black Course is an extremely difficult course which we recommend only for highly skilled golfers."" Intimidated yet? That's championship golf! Bethpage State Park; green fee: $130 weekdays, $150 weekends; +1 516 249 0707 . Chambers Bay, University Place, Washington . After the success of the Bethpage Black experiment, the USGA began adding more public courses to the U.S. Open roster. The superb Chambers Bay course is one. It will host its first U.S. Open in 2015. Designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. and opened for play in 2007, this stunning 7,165-yard, par 72 course hosted the 2010 U.S. Amateur. Visitors are warned that cart use is available only with a medical certificate and prior arrangement. But if you're up to it, this 950-acre property on the shores of Puget Sound is an absolute joy to walk. Chambers Bay; green fee: $219; +1 877 295 4657 . Erin Hills, Erin, Wisconsin . Near Milwaukee, Erin Hills will host the U.S. Open in 2017. Specifically designed on gently rolling wetlands to accommodate a major championship and opened for play in 2006, Erin Hills hosted the U.S. Amateur in 2011. The 7,823-yard, par 72 course is another walking-only venue, with neither buggies nor pull carts allowed; caddies are available for $50 (plus tip) per round. Erin Hills; green fee: $200; +1 866 772 4769 . Pebble Beach Golf Links, Pebble Beach, California . Always in the discussion of most beautiful U.S. golf courses, this magnificent course features many holes beside the Pacific Ocean on California's Monterey Peninsula. In 1972, it was the first public course to stage the U.S. Open, won by Jack Nicklaus. It hosted subsequent U.S. Opens in 1982, 1992, 2000 and 2010, and its next is scheduled for 2019. ""If I had only one more round to play, I would choose to play it at Pebble Beach,"" Jack Nicklaus has famously said. ""I've loved this course from the first time I saw it. It's possibly the best in the world."" Pebble Beach Resorts; green fee: $495; +1 831 622 8723 . Pinehurst No. 2, Pinehurst, North Carolina . Memorably won by the late Payne Stewart, the Donald Ross-designed Pinehurst No. 2 course held its first U.S. Open in 1999. The course had already hosted a PGA Championship in 1936 and a Ryder Cup in 1951, and held its second U.S. Open in 2005. Next year, it'll become the first venue to host a U.S. Open and a U.S. Women's Open in subsequent weeks. The historic course opened for play in 1907 and measures 7,485 yards -- it's a par 70 from the back tees. There are eight fantastic courses at the Pinehurst Resort, so it's worth staying a few days to play some of the others, especially numbers 4 and 8. Golf at Pinehurst is available only to overnight resort guests. Pinehurst Resort; stay-and-play packages from $488 (includes a round on the No. 2 course, cart and range balls); +1 855 235 8507 .

Just north of San Diego, the south course at Torrey Pines -- a lush, 7,643-yard, par 71 course, with a number of clifftop holes overlooking the Pacific Ocean -- hosted the 2008 U.S. Open. That's the event Tiger Woods won after hobbling his way around the course with a knee injury. He won on the first sudden death playoff hole after finishing tied with Rocco Mediate after 72 holes and again after the 18-hole playoff round.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- After much speculation, it is now official: The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 18th Party Congress in Beijing during the ""latter half of this year,"" a party official announced this week without giving specific dates. The political conclave, held every five years, will shape China's future. It will also formalize the accession of a new generation of leaders. China has seen dramatic socio-economic transformation in recent years, but its political system remains opaque and antiquated. The Leninist, top-down system still does not allow direct, open elections. Instead, selections are made by a coterie of communist party cadres after drawn-out negotiations and horse-trading behind closed doors. A total of 2,270 delegates have been elected from across the country to represent the CPC's 82 million members. Who are these delegates? About 30% are from grassroots, says Wang Jingqing, vice minister of the party's organization department. Most are national, provincial and city officials. Ni Yulan and the agonies of Chinese justice . Their average age is 52. Only 5 % are under 35. Some 23% of them are female, and 11% are ethnic minorities. Although the CPC claims to represent the working class, only 169 (less than 8%) of the total delegates are workers. Theoretically, the delegates play an important role. At the end of the party congress, they will elect a new Central Committee. This time, Wang says, there will be more candidates than posts -- unlike in the past when the numbers of candidates were exactly the same as the open slots. About 300-member strong, the policy-making body is a motley group of provincial and city leaders, technocrats, military officers and party functionaries, plus token representatives from other sectors. The Central Committee will then elect a new Politburo, the inner council currently comprising 25 members. The Politburo in turn will elect a new standing committee, the elite cabal empowered to make important decisions on policies. The committee currently has nine seats, led by Chinese President and General Secretary Hu Jintao. Hu, 69, is expected to step down later this year. Media reports say the party plans to cut the seats down to seven, but Wang says there is no decision on the matter. In practice, the selection of politicians into the Central Committee and the Politburo are determined even before the Party Congress. ""The wheeling and dealing has long begun,"" says a Beijing-based political analyst, who asked not to be named. ""We are now in the endgame."" Bo Xilai and the politics of Chinese succession . But the race to China's pinnacle of power remains opaque. ""In the U.S. you have wall-to-wall coverage of what candidates say and do and how people voted,"" says the analyst. ""Here it's all neibu (for internal consumption), without open campaigning."" Personnel decisions are negotiated and finalized by party insiders behind the walls of Zhongnanhai, the CPC's official headquarters in Beijing. When the Party Congress convenes, it will be largely a formality. Still, which new leaders will emerge in key positions remains a subject of speculation. For now the front-runner to succeed Hu as party boss and president is Xi Jinping. Xi, 59, became Vice President in 2008 and was later appointed a vice-chair of the CPC's Central Military Commission -- important steps in succession. He earlier served as party chief of the prosperous provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang and Shanghai, China's financial center. Xi is a ""princeling,"" a descendant of revolutionary veterans. His late father Xi Zhongxun, a contemporary of Deng Xiaoping, had served as governor of Guangdong province. The other top contender is Li Keqiang, 57, a protege of Hu and the presumptive successor to Wen Jiabao when he steps down from premiership in March next year. Li is already ranked 7th in the Politburo and, as executive vice premier, holds important portfolios, including economic development, finance, climate change and health care reform. Like Hu, Li is a native of Anhui province and honed his organizational skills when he headed the 73 million-strong Communist Youth League, a training ground for the party's young cadres. Why Chinese succession matters . Many of upcoming leaders used to work at CYL, which is why analysts speak if a ""tuanpai,"" or CYL faction. Other rising politicians include: . Li Yuanchao, 61, the minister of the CPC's Organization Department, the equivalent of the H.R. department, and more. With this portfolio, Li holds all the personnel dossiers and wields considerable power in appointing party and government officials nationwide. Wang Qishan, 64, the former Beijing mayor who currently serves as the Vice-Premier in charge of economic, energy and financial affairs. Like Li, Wang is already a member of the Politburo. Analysts expect both to get promoted into the Standing Committee. A few Gen-Y leaders may be lined up for meteoric rise. Among them is Hu Chunhua, 49, the party chief of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. No relation to the Chinese president, he is nonetheless another protÃ©gÃ© and also served as head of the CYL and is known as ""Little Hu."" Influence may not be confined to delegates. Jiang Zemin, the retired party chief and state president, was last year rumored to have died, or was dying, but a source says he is now in fairly good health. ""He swims 600 meters everyday and gets daily tutorials in foreign languages, economics and other topics,"" says the source. He turns 88 next week. Although Jiang has been out of the public eye since retiring 10 years ago, he is believed to still wield residual influence in policy and personnel issues. The other influential politician is Bo Xilai, the former Party chief of Chongqing who was dismissed last April for ""serious breach of Party regulations."" Bo's wife Gu Kailai, accused of premeditated murder of a British businessman, is now awaiting a court verdict. The party has yet to formally decide on Bo's fate, but the signals are clear. Bo is not among the 2,270 party members elected as Party Congress delegates. That, analysts say, spells the end of his career.","China's political system does not allow direct, open elections .

"Ankara, Turkey (CNN) -- A top Turkish official apologized for the ""police aggression"" that fueled nationwide protests against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as trade unions threw their weight behind the demonstrations Tuesday. The 240,000-member KESK confederation of public-sector workers called for a two-day strike to protest what it called the ""fascism"" of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party. The protests began over plans to replace an Istanbul park with a new development, but spread nationwide after a heavy-handed crackdown by police. After chaotic scenes in the streets Monday that continued late into the night and sent tear gas wafting through the air, the situation was relatively calm Tuesday in Istanbul's Taksim Square, near the park where the protest movement began, and in the capital Ankara. Riot police around Ankara's central Kizilay Square brought in armored vehicles topped with water cannon in a show of force Tuesday evening, but the demonstrations throughout the day were calm. The protests have morphed into larger complaints against Erdogan, who has led Turkey for 10 years. His critics call him paternalistic and authoritarian, accusing him of accumulating more and more power and growing less tolerant of dissent. In Istanbul, the crowds have been chanting ""Tayyip resign"" -- referring to Erdogan -- and ""shoulder to shoulder against fascism."" What's driving unrest and protests in Turkey? Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc apologized Tuesday ""for the police aggression against our citizens who were involved in the initial protests and acted with environmental concern,"" Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. He said security forces had been ordered to only use gas in self-defense. ""They are doing a hard job. When they are executing their jobs, they may sometimes use extraordinary, even excessive, use of force. But they wait in a passive mode unless something comes from the other side,"" Arinc said. And he added, ""I don't think we owe an apology to those who caused destruction on the streets and who interfered with people's freedom."" The Turkish Medical Association said that at least 3,195 people were injured in clashes Sunday and Monday, with 26 in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries were in Istanbul. Read more: Turkish protesters decry 'unprecedented violence' One protester, Mehmet Ayvalitas, died of his injuries, the medical association said. And the governor of Hatay in southeastern Turkey said that a 22-year-old man, Abdulah Comert, was killed with a firearm by unknown people during demonstrations late Monday, Anadolu reported. Erdogan's opponents appear determined to continue the demonstrations despite the prime minister's comment Monday that he expects the situation to return to normal ""within a few days."" Erdogan, who left the country Monday on a four-day trip to North Africa, has responded by dismissing the demonstrations as the work of ""extreme elements"" and marginal groups. ""My smart citizens will recognize this, then they will give them the right lesson,"" he said Monday. The protests began after plans were made to raze Gezi Park, the last green space in central Istanbul, and replace it with a replica of 19th-century Ottoman barracks. The development would contain a shopping mall. Despite economic boom, Erdogan targeted by protests . What began as a sit-in by a handful of angry residents quickly grew into a larger protest. Riot police moved in, using tear gas and pepper spray. Protesters responded by hurling bottles, setting up barricades, blocking bulldozers and burning trash in the middle of the street. Then, outraged by the behavior of security forces, demonstrators began attacking police. International groups including Amnesty International have criticized the police response as excessive. In Ankara on Sunday night, a CNN crew witnessed authorities roughing up at least one protester. One police officer kicked a CNN videographer, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported, and a CNN crew in Istanbul on Sunday also witnessed bloodied protesters. The protests have spread to 67 of Turkey's 81 provinces, according to Anadolu. While Erdogan has maintained a defiant tone, Turkish President Abdullah Gul sounded a conciliatory note Monday, saying ""the messages sent in good faith have been received."" Opinion: Is Turkey on the verge of a meltdown? Hugh Pope, a senior Turkey analyst with the International Crisis Group, called the protests ""completely unprecedented"" and said Erdogan was caught off guard. Most demonstrators, Pope said, are ""overwhelmingly ordinary people"" who simply want their voices heard. ""However, there are other demonstrators who are somewhat more opportunistic in the left-wing factions who normally don't get much in the way of airtime in Turkey and are camped on Taksim Square,"" Pope said. Erdogan has defiantly praised his government's accomplishments in overseeing a decade of strong economic growth in Turkey. His party has won the past three elections, most recently securing 49.95% of the vote in 2011. ""What you have is essentially a large group of Turks who feel alienated from this government, in power for 10 years,"" said Richard Haass, a Middle East analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. ""It's increasingly a one-party country. All the politics happen within it. The opposition is weak, divided, feckless,"" he said. ""You have a lot of people in Turkey who feel both alienated and intimidated by the government, and this is the way they decided to push back.""

"(CNN) -- Five people, including the daughter of the Qatari culture minister, were ordered detained as authorities investigate a fire that killed 19 people at a Doha, Qatar, shopping mall, the state-run Qatar News Agency reported. Thirteen of those who died in the Monday blaze were children in a nursery at the upscale Villaggio shopping mall. Those detained at the order of the attorney general include the owner of the mall; the owner of the nursery; the mall's director and deputy director; and the mall's assistant director, the news agency reported Tuesday. The nursery's owner is the daughter of Minister of Culture Iman Al Qawwari. The mall's security director and the official in charge of issuing licenses were among those summoned by the attorney general, QNA reported. The government has set up a committee to investigate ""the causes and circumstances"" of the blaze, QNA said Monday night. It is also investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms weren't working at the mall when the blaze broke out. Mall fire: ""Accident waiting to happen?"" Christine Wigton, an American living in Doha, told CNN she heard ""a buzzer, not very loud"" as she walked into the mall, but heard no loud alarms as smoke built up inside. Elementary school-age children were eating at some of the restaurants and no one was trying to escape, she said. ""There were no sprinklers, and there was nothing that would tell somebody that something was wrong,"" she said. Built in 2006, the mall advertises itself as ""the newest and the largest entertainment center in Doha."" The Venice-themed complex features gondola rides down an indoor canal, an artificial sky, a 13-screen movie theater, a theme park, skating rink and a bowling alley. Qatar's Interior Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, said earlier the civil defense office reviews safety standards for commercial buildings before they grant a license. ""The investigation will clarify all the circumstances of the incident and find out the shortcomings and question those who are responsible in order to tackle the matter in the future,"" he said in remarks carried by QNA. Several of the dead were from Qatar's expatriate community. The mall's website on Wednesday showed a picture of a black ribbon. ""We offer our deepest condolences to all the families of the victims and martyrs on duty who lost their lives in the fire,"" the site says. ""May the departed souls rest in peace and may almighty Allah give fortitude to the bereaved families to bear this irreparable loss.""","The mall's owner and the owner of the nursery are among those detained .

Points celebrated his win at the Houston Open by posing for the cameras with his best impression of the trend that has gone viral on the internet -- the American golfer slouched on the green with a slightly vacant expression on his face with the tournament trophy by his side. Before Points' win, which earned him a place at the Masters and a winner's check of $1.16 million, the U.S. PGA Tour event had been buzzing with laughter after the likes of McIlroy et al posted pictures of themselves on Twitter mimicking Jason Dufner's unfortunate photograph of himself looking rather disinterested in a Texas classroom surrounded by children, while performing a charity visit last week. ""What can I say, I was tired, my back hurt from sitting on the floor, and we were talking about relaxation and focusing,"" tweeted Dufner, explaining his lackadaisical posture and the less than animated expression on his face. Too late -- #Dufnering was quickly trending after a succession of leading golfers gently poked fun at their sporting colleague on Twitter. Sitting in front of the General Lee car from the Dukes of Hazard television series that he owns, Watson tweeted: ""Just #Dufnering in the garage!!"" Other sports starts quickly got in on the act, peppering Dufner's Twitter timeline with their own version of the online phenomenon -- former tennis player Andy Roddick even tweeted a picture of his dog ""Dufnering"". Given Points had made just two cuts in nine starts this year, the 36-year-old was not surprisingly only too happy to oblige the photographers with his own take on golf's new craze after his win on Sunday at the Redstone Club. ""You know, again, I want to win,"" Points told the PGA Tour website as he more seriously outlined his future ambitions. ""I want to win more than once. I want to have the opportunity to win majors, I want to play in Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups. These are things I want to do and I know I'm capable of doing. ""So I never doubt that I can do it. I certainly get down and frustrated when I make two of nine cuts. That's not making you feel real great about yourself.'' Remarkably Points earned his place at the Masters thanks to some help from his mother's putter as he finished one shot ahead of compatriot Billy Horschel and Sweden's Henrik Stenson. ""I've been hitting it better and better, and I saw Brian White for a putting lesson,'' added Points, who holed a 13-foot par putt at the 72nd hole to to clinch victory after thunderstorms had halted play in the closing stretch. ""Gave me a couple things, changed the putter, boom, felt great, and here I am. ""So, the thing about it, is I never count myself out. I never just chalk it up, like, 'Oh, this year is over with.' I've never ever felt like that. I was just grinding, just trying to wait and try to find that one thing that was like, boom, there it is and there I go. ""Fortunately, it was this week and I capitalized on it."" McIlroy, who announced during the tournament that he would postpone a UNICEF charity trip to Haiti in order to add this week's Texas Open to his schedule, finished tied for 45th -- 12 shots behind Points. He is still seeking his first victory this season, having fallen to No. 2 in the world rankings behind Tiger Woods.","Golfers gripped by desire to ""Dufner""

"Beijing (CNN) -- A Chinese journalist, whose work exposed alleged human rights abuses of the government, has been detained by secret police in Beijing, said a close friend and human rights groups. Du Bin released a feature-length documentary on the notorious Masanjia labor camp in May. He vanished later that month, says Hu Jia, an activist and friend of Du. Hu says the last time Du's friends heard from him was 10 p.m. on May 31. Friends went to his apartment to look for him the next day but no one answered the door. Hu says family members found two copies of an unsigned police subpoena at Du's residence in Beijing. Copies of the alleged warrants viewed by CNN suggest that Du faces allegations including disturbing public order. Hu says they have heard from two separate eyewitnesses that Du was taken into detention by force. ""We confirmed that Du Bin was taken by 10 secret police. Two in uniform and the rest in plain clothes,"" says Hu. ""Du Bin is a very respected professional photographer, documentary film-maker and author with a distinguished record of collaboration with international media organizations,"" says Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. Du recently released a book on the Tiananmen massacre that was published in Hong Kong. His documentary on Masanjia focused on interviews with former inmates of the labor camp. China maintains an extensive network of labor camps across the country used to punish petty criminals like prostitutes and thieves. But activists say they are used by the government to detain political activists and members of the outlawed religious group Falun Gong.

Hu said that most of Du's belongings had been taken from his residence including his laptops, copies of his books, and hardware used to edit his documentary. CNN sought comment on Du's whereabouts from the Ministry of Public Security, which did not respond to our requests. ""Du Bin's detention on criminal charges is a worrying signal about the attitude of the new leadership towards dissent. The charges against him are unfounded and a transparent strategy for the authorities to silence him and intimidate others,"" says Bequelin.

"(CNN) -- Last week, Beijing's leading English-language newspaper, China Daily, begun publishing a weekly Africa edition, focusing on financial news and targeting Africa's growing middle class. Earlier this year, China's international broadcaster, CCTV, launched an impressive media operation in Africa, producing one hour a day of content from the continent as well as feature programs on African affairs, through a newsroom of more than 40 Chinese and 70 African staff members. Both initiatives add to the more established activities of China's news agency, Xinhua, which in recent years has deepened its partnerships with African media outlets and provides them with news from across the world as well as from the dozens of African countries where it has correspondents. The lightning growth of Chinese media is part of the dramatic expansion of the presence of Chinese diplomats, peacekeepers, commercial actors (state-owned or private) and ordinary citizens that has been transforming the African continent in the last 10-15 years . From Angola's oilfields and Dakar's markets to Congo's mines and Nairobi newsrooms, supply and demand centers are being reconfigured, cultural encounters are shaking social networks and alternative political alliances are emerging. The new developments in the media offer an interesting lens to highlight the trade-offs and learning curves that define the increasingly complex China-Africa story. Read related: Chinese media make inroads into Africa . In a context of Africa's growing importance to the global economy, Chinese media present a radical challenge to Western style journalism. As was highlighted at a recent conference at Oxford University, Chinese news media are seeking to compete with players such as CNN and Al Jazeera, but they are rolling out what they claim is a different approach to journalism. What Chinese media are offering to Africa is ""positive reporting,"" a style of journalism that focuses on collective achievements rather than divisive issues like political crises or sensational negative news like famines. Their message is that Africa, similarly to China, has received too much negative publicity in the Western-dominated global media. In this view, Chinese and African voices are finally finding ways to tell their own stories which offer a healthy correction to stereotypes of Africa as the ""hopeless continent,"" with endless wars, HIV and hunger. The Africa of today, while still consumed by many intractable problems, is no longer the Africa of the 1990s: Millions of Africans are seizing on unprecedented opportunities to build new lives. This optimistic message about Africa turning a corner has faced criticism on different fronts. One of the most pertinent charges is that ""positive reporting"" fails to deliver on one of the main mandates of journalism: acting as a watchdog and keeping those in power in check, rather than praising them for their successes. The tight controls on the media landscape that dominate public debates in China are being mirrored in coverage of Africa, which does not question Beijing's ties with unsavory regimes like Mugabe's Zimbabwe or Dos Santos's Angola, and which does little of the important investigative journalism that is required to ensure Africa's real economic growth does not just accrue to the top 1% in society. Read related: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? Yet however justified the questioning of uncritical positive reporting about African economies and their political regulators is, the main risk of reporting Africa is not simply on the tone of the reporting: rather, it is the ability to shed clichÃ©s and use the resources available to promote a better knowledge of the continent. A major potential pitfall is that an equally stereotypical positive image will substitute a stereotypical negative image of Africa. There is a crowd of self-appointed experts of the continent who are reinventing clichÃ©s to stress Africa's untapped potential, when just a few years ago they were the propagators of a relentless Afro-pessimism. This is unhelpful in terms of understanding what is happening in dynamic but confusing countries like Ethiopia, Nigeria or Mozambique. Nor can it be considered empowering for ordinary Africans who will continue to feel that media coverage ignores the complex dilemmas, challenges and opportunities they face as the continent tries to reinvent itself. Read related: The Africans looking to make it in China . A second major danger lies in a creeping ideologization of the debate: An opportunity to bring new energy to the debate on how to produce good journalism risks being wasted by entrenchment of old positions and repetition of sterile debates. The Cold War world witnessed a battle between positive and negative reporting that did not do much good to journalism. Western-style journalism risks being complacent and stressing its moral superiority in supporting ""investigative work"" while not realizing that uncovering corruption in Africa and not having the resources to follow up on that story will produce little or no results, apart from praise to the brave (probably white, middle aged) journalist who reported it. Similarly, Chinese journalists may feel too attached to their idea of telling upbeat stories that they will miss many opportunities to learn about the complexities of the continent. That is a shame, because Chinese media would gain enormous international respect -- and a strong bond with African media consumers -- if they were able to expose corruption cases in which Chinese companies and individuals are involved. We believe that in today's rapidly changing Africa, there is great room for experimentation and mutual learning: the continent could be at the forefront of an overdue exercise in soul searching by the international media, whether Asian, Arab, African or Western. Above all, we expect that China will not just continue to reshape Africa in the coming years, but that Africa itself will force the likes of CCTV and Xinhua to participate in more intensive internal and external discussions about freedom of expression, the links between media, human rights and development, and the commercial durability of an artificial good news show. As China engages Africa through the media, it is also in turn engaged and forced to think critically about itself: the greatest geopolitical force for change on the continent could find itself more changed than it originally signed up for. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry Verhoeven and Iginio Gagliardone.","New ""Africa edition"" of China Daily part of Chinese media influence on the continent .

"(CNN) -- The reaction to Mackenzie Phillips' detailed account of her sexual relationship with her father, John Phillips, has been explosive, and some of the strongest statements have come from her family. Chynna Phillips said she doesn't think anyone could make up having a consensual incestuous relationship. But as the former actress and musician talked with Oprah Winfrey for the second time this week -- this time about the firestorm that erupted from her hour-long interview Wednesday -- she said she doesn't regret writing her memoir, ""High on Arrival."" ""I understand this is a difficult thing for my family,"" Phillips told Winfrey via satellite Friday, ""but nobody's talking about this, and if I've started a national dialogue, then I'm forever grateful."" Phillips said she has gotten letters and Facebook messages from incest survivors, thanking her for coming forward. ""It's been heartening and heartbreaking at the same time,"" she said. John Phillips died in 2001. Two of his former wives, however, have vehemently denied Mackenzie Phillips' accusations. In an statement to CNN, Michelle Phillips, an original Mamas & Papas bandmate who divorced John in 1970, called the situation ""very hurtful."" ""Mackenzie's drug addiction for 35 years has been the result of many unpleasant experiences,"" Michelle Phillips said. ""Whether her relationship with her father is delusional or not, it is an unfortunate circumstance and very hurtful for our entire family."" She spoke more strongly to The Hollywood Reporter's Roger Friedman, telling him, ""Mackenzie has a lot of mental illness. She's had a needle stuck up her arm for 35 years. ... She did 'Celebrity Rehab,' and now she writes a book. The whole thing is timed."" Genevieve Waite, who married John Phillips in 1972, told Winfrey in a statement that ""John was a good man who had a lot of problems, [but] he was incapable, no matter how drunk or drugged he was, to have sexual relations with his own child."" The fallout from Phillips' decision to reveal her family's secrets has been heartbreaking for her sister Bijou as well. Bijou Phillips supplied a statement to Winfrey stating that Mackenzie told her about the incestuous relationship with their father when Bijou was 13 but later denied it. ""This news was confusing and also scary, because I'd lived alone with him since I was 3,"" she said. ""[John Phillips] was Mr. Mom, loving and encouraging; the man who raised me would never be capable of such things."" She also questioned why Mackenzie would leave her alone with their father if he'd molested the elder sister. Still, Bijou Phillips showed signs of measured support. ""I understand Mackenzie's need to come clean, but it hurts because the man in question isn't here to defend himself,"" she said. ""I hope she can come to terms with this and find peace."" Mackenzie Phillips told Winfrey that her family's disbelief and anger saddened her, especially since she and Bijou Phillips have been very close. Phillips recalled the way Bijou immediately came to her aid when she was arrested last year for cocaine and heroin possession. ""I love my baby sister, and I miss having contact with her,"" Mackenzie said. ""By the time Bijou was living with my father, I felt she was safe. I did take her out of there if I felt like she wasn't being watched properly,"" she said in her defense. But she added that Michelle Phillips' statements weren't as surprising. ""When Michelle found out I was writing this book, she vowed to do everything to discredit me,"" Mackenzie told Winfrey. ""She's having a textbook reaction, trying to sweep it under the rug. It seems so unkind and ungenerous to lash out in this way; I don't have a history of mental illness. I have a history of drug addiction."" Chynna Phillips, who also sat down with Winfrey on Friday, said she believes that her mother, Michelle, made those statements out of anger and that she does still love Mackenzie, even if she doesn't admit it. ""I think the most devastating thing is when people are in denial and don't want things on a public platform, it's not something everyone wants to share with the world,"" Chynna Phillips said. ""It's not something my mom wants plastered all over the papers."" Chynna told Winfrey that she'd known about her sister's history with her father for about 12 years and believes that no one would go out of their way to admit having a consensual incestuous relationship. She's also not the only one who thinks Mackenzie is telling the truth. Jessica Woods, the daughter of former Mamas & Papas band member Denny Doherty, also wrote in to Winfrey and said her father knew about everything. ""I just watched your show,"" Woods wrote, ""and everything she said is true. My dad told me the awful truth, and he was horrified at what John had done."" Chynna, who grew up with her mother, said that although she didn't spend a lot of time with John Phillips, the memories she had of him were positive, in spite of the heavy drug use she witnessed. ""He was a very charismatic man,"" she said. ""He was a very talented man and a very loving man in many ways."" Now one half of the Christian music duo Chynna and Vaughan, Chynna said that her relationship with Mackenzie has grown over the past six months and that she's proud of her half-sister for having the courage to talk about her past. ""The thing is, who among us haven't done something that we're highly ashamed of in our lives?"" she said to Winfrey. ""Who are we to cast the first stone? In my faith, as a Christian, God told me I need to forgive. Am I happy that she put me in this position? No, I'm not. But I have to forgive. It's 13 years later, and I still haven't digested this information."" Chynna added that she hopes her sister will take her experiences and use them to help others, offering one piece of advice: ""Get the Lord on board, because you'll need it.""","Mackenzie Phillips talks about family's reaction to her claims of incest .

"Beijing (CNN) -- The public outcry continued in China's cyberspace days after Haobo, a two-month-old boy, was killed by a man who stole his parents' car with the child inside. The incident attracted attention at the highest levels of government, and raised much online finger-pointing to the suspect, police, the parents, Chinese media and society. It also shed light on censorship in China, after a decree from propaganda chiefs on how local media should cover the case was leaked online. The tragedy started Monday morning when Haobo's father, who lives in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun, left him in his car with the engine running while he went into the store he owns to turn on indoor heating. When he came out, the car was gone with Haobo inside. The parents turned to the police and the public for help. Over 8,000 police officers took part in a manhunt, searching neighborhoods and parks. READ: Body of baby killed in China carjacking found . The news of Haobo's disappearance spread quickly, his picture forwarded across Chinese websites and on mobile phones. Millions of netizens were on tenterhooks, waiting for updates. Over 30 hours after the car theft, a 48-year-old man named Zhou Xijun turned himself up to the police. He admitted to strangling the toddler and burying him in the snow. The baby's body has been found later. China soul-search . This sad story reminded me of what happened last year to Wang Yueyue, the 2-year-old girl in southern China who was run over by a truck twice and was left dying unassisted as 18 people passed her by. Her plight, and the lack of human compassion, also triggered nationwide soul-searching. Many Chinese complain about the decline in public ethics. To some, this week's death generated debate about the nation's apparent moral decay in the midst of an economic boom. ""How can one even imagine strangling a baby just to steal a car?"" Ping Gu, a white-collar worker in Beijing tells me. ""What about basic humanity, conscience, values?"" At the ongoing annual meeting of China's legislature, Premier Wen Jiabao obliquely acknowledged the problem, too. ""We should greatly increase education in public morality, professional ethics, family virtues and personal integrity,"" the outgoing premier said in his state-of-the-nation speech last Monday. Wen proposed to ""foster healthy social conduct."" Censors jump on coverage . Meanwhile, China's propaganda czars have imposed a gag rule to stop the negative reporting on the case. In an internal decree issued Tuesday soon after the killer surrendered, they instructed the local media in Changchun to mute their reporting. A screen grab of the decree was captured before it was deleted. Translation: . 1. No front page coverage, the story shouldn't be bigger than half a page on newspapers. TV channels shall not run long feature reports. 2. Reports should criticize the killer and highlight the positive efforts made by the police. 3. No questioning or finger-pointing of the police. Don't criticize the city's (Skynet) surveillance network. Stop interviewing victim's family and relatives. 4. Without further orders, newspapers should stop covering the incident starting tomorrow. TV and radio should stop covering after tomorrow's morning news. Perusal of the local Changchun newspapers the past few days show that the local media have acceded to the decree. Recent reports on the incident were short, tucked inside and uplifting. On March 7, four days after the incident, the Changchun Daily published on page 4 a short report saying that the Changchun city officials had visited Haobo's relatives, who ""expressed thanks to people from various sectors for their concern and hard work."" A local Changchun journalist, who requested anonymity, complained of being ""caught in between a furious public who wants follow up stories on the incident and the propaganda officials who imposed the gag order."" Online firestorm . Despite the media clampdown, Haobo's grisly death has sparked public uproar, especially on Weibo, China's micro-blogging site with more than 250 million users. Many condemned the killer. ""Hurry with the verdict!"" said @LuoMoShideShang. ""He deserves death penalty, no better way to calm people's outrage."" Others blamed the parents. ""What kind of parents will leave their babies alone in cars?"" asked @Qiyanhenziaozhang. Still others blamed the media. ""Everywhere is posting information about the baby, and they irritated the killer and provoked his desperate act. The media has done a really bad work,"" said Shenshang. Several netizens juxtaposed Haobo's death with a similar incident in the United States. A month ago, an SUV was stolen in the Bronx in New York City, with an 8-month-old girl still inside. ""The silver Jeep was found abandoned just over an hour later with the child unharmedâ€”after the perp phoned in the car's location to police,"" the New York Post reported. @ZuoJingXiaoWu: ""Ironically it's the same story but with very different outcomes! I believe that race has nothing to do with it but the problem is that Chinese people's moral education is disgusting. Also, brain-dead parents have no qualifications for parenthood."" @LanXiaoHaiMayday: ""It's either a matter of better law or purer hearts."" As the finger-pointing continues, other netizens have turned their ire on the police. One noted how the government in Changchun, the city where the crime took place, had since 2007 invested 140 million yuan ($22.5 million) to install a ""Skynet project"" an intra-city video surveillance network, equipped with some 60,000 closed-circuit cameras. A micro-blogger named @LaoXuCommentary wryly noted: ""Citizens found the stolen car, the suspect turned himself in, thousands of police searched downtown while the man had escaped to the countryside already. A camera surveillance system worth 140 million yuan went blind in this case."" While some angry postings have been deleted on China's social media sites, no new key words related to the case have been blocked on Chinese search engines -- a common censorship tactic -- just yet. Meantime, citizens are still expressing their grief and outrage on Haobo's grisly death online.","Huge outcry in China's cyberspace after a two-month-old boy was killed by a carjacker .

Three guards died in the attack and another was injured, the Interior Ministry said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the assault. All attackers were killed, said U.S. Ambassador James B. Cunningham in a statement condemning the attack. He called on the Taliban to cease violence and ""come to the table to talk to the Afghanistan government about peace and reconciliation."" The palace is located in the Shash Darak district of Kabul, near the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters of the International Security Assistance Force. ""We're monitoring the situation right now,"" said Maj. Will Griffin, an ISAF spokesman, during the attack. ""We've heard reports of explosions and small arms fire.

"(CNN) -- A man used a fake Facebook account to lure a girl out of her home to stage a kidnapping and eventual rescue, but ended up killing her, according to a Maine State Police affidavit. Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, Maine, was indicted Wednesday on kidnapping and murder charges in the death of 15-year-old Nichole Cable, according to Tim Feeley, special assistant to the Maine attorney general. Dube is accused of posing as a friend of Cable's on Facebook and repeatedly requesting to meet with her in person. The affidavit states that on May 12, she agreed to meet him to obtain marijuana believing him to be that friend. According to the affidavit, police interviewed Dube's brother, who told them Dube gave him this account of what happened: He waited in the woods wearing a ski mask, jumped out of the bushes, duct-taped Cable and put her in the back of his father's truck. When he removed her from the truck, he realized she was dead and dumped her body in the woods. Cable's body was found eight days later. Dube's brother also told police that Kyle intended to kidnap Cable and he planned to ""find"" her later in an attempt to look like a hero, according to the affidavit. The man whom Dube is accused of impersonating told police that he suspected Dube of creating a fraudulent Facebook account in his name. According to the affidavit, the man also said Dube wanted to have sex with Cable, but that she had refused his advances. Dube faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison for the kidnapping charge, as well as 20 years to life for the murder charge, William Stokes, Maine deputy attorney general and chief of the criminal division, told CNN. ""There's a form of murder in which you may not have intended to kill, but that you engaged in conduct that had such high death-producing potential and depraved indifference to the value of human life,"" Stokes said. ""When someone engages in that conduct, it's murder whether you intended to kill or not."" Cable's cause of death has not yet been determined. The medical examiner's office is still awaiting results on a few tests before making a final evaluation, Stokes said. Stephen Smith, Dube's attorney, cautioned that Dube is innocent until proven guilty. ""The police never got a direct confession from him and the jury's still out,"" Smith told CNN. ""We would urge the public to exercise some restraint and not leap to judgment."" Stokes said that Cable's family has been kept informed of the case. CNN's attempts to reach Cable's family were unsuccessful. No court date has yet been set, Stokes said.","Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, Maine, is indicted on kidnapping and murder charges .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States is biding its time in its effort to get fugitive leaker Edward Snowden delivered to its custody, hoping that Russia wearies of him and Ecuador decides against granting him asylum, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday. Snowden, the former National Security Agency computer contractor who exposed details of U.S. surveillance programs, faces espionage charges if shipped back home. He is currently cooling his heels at Moscow's international airport, where he arrived Sunday from Hong Kong. ""Time is our friend,"" one senior administration official told CNN. ""The Russians now just want him gone, and I'm not sure if they care at this point if he goes to a country that might be inclined to send him back."" The State Department revoked Snowden's passport after charges were brought last week. Officials in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, said it needed more information before it could act on a U.S. request to hold him there. WikiLeaks said Snowden flew out of Hong Kong on refugee papers issued by Ecuador, where he has requested asylum, but Ecuador's deputy foreign minister said Wednesday that his country had provided him no documents. 4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back . Russian President Vladimir Putin said his government won't hand Snowden over to U.S. authorities, but seemed eager to wash his hands of the issue. ""The sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself,"" Putin said Tuesday during a visit to Finland. Snowden has the assistance of WikiLeaks, the organization that facilitates the disclosure of classified information. Ecuador has already granted asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the country's embassy in London for a year after losing a court battle to avoid extradition to Sweden. Washington has urged countries where Snowden may be headed, including Ecuador, to turn him away. But the senior administration official said Ecuadorian officials appear to be avoiding high-level discussions on the matter. Their ambassador to Washington is out of the country, and their foreign minister is on a trip to Asia. Speaking in Vietnam this week, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said his government will consider the U.S. request when it decides on Snowden's plea for asylum, which the United States considers a sign that the highest levels of the Ecuadorian government have gotten the message. The administration official said the fact that Ecuador is not rushing a decision is the best possible news, since Snowden will remain a hot potato in the Russians' hands during that time. Snowden: I took job to gather evidence . U.S.-Ecuadorian ties have been strained during the administration of Ecuador's current president, Rafael Correa. A leftist ally of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Correa closed an outpost at an Ecuadorian air base that the U.S. military used to conduct anti-drug operations. Washington and Quito expelled each others' ambassadors in 2011 after an American diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks suggested that Correa was aware of acts of corruption by the police high command, and the United States has criticized recent laws that international observers say limit press freedoms. The $20 million the United States provides in aid to Ecuador is a relatively small amount, and the administration is holding off on talk of any additional pressure until its government makes a decision on asylum. ""We are not at the point where we are making threats yet,"" the official said. ""We are reserving the harder line until they know for sure whether the Ecuadorians are willing to take him in.""","""Time is our friend,"" a senior administration official says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Jobs and money, national identity and political stability. These are some of the contentious issues driving the presidential election in Taiwan this weekend. Seeking another four-year term is the incumbent president Ma Ying Jeou of the ruling Kuomintang Party, pitted against Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Who wins the election will influence Taiwan's relations with mainland China and impact business, geopolitics and security in the region, including China-U.S. ties. For many Taiwanese electorates, political observers say, the main issues are jobs, economics and Taiwanese identity. For the policy-makers in Beijing, however, the overriding question is whether the next Taiwan president will stick to the status quo. That means abiding by the ""1992 Consensus,"" a tacit and ambiguous agreement reached 20 years ago between Beijing and Taipei under which both sides agreed on the principle of ""one China"" without agreeing on how it is to be defined or interpreted. Despite the ambiguity, the 1992 Consensus has served as the basis for cross-strait dialogue that has led in recent years to the unprecedented blossoming of economic and people-to-people ties across the Taiwan Strait. In Beijing's view, ""zuguo tongyi,"" or reunification of the motherland, is a matter of national pride and iron-clad policy. Beijing says it prefers to do so peacefully but refuses to rule out the use of force to keep Taiwan from declaring itself a separate state. China keeps hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan, an ominous threat to the island to stay in the fold. War in the Taiwan Strait would prompt a China-U.S. standoff. In 1954, the U.S. and Taiwan signed a mutual defense treaty. Even now, Washington sells Taiwan advanced jet fighters and other military hardware. America is also bound by the Taiwan Relations Act, U.S. legislation passed in 1979, to consider an attack on the island as ""a threat to the peace and security"" of the region and ""of grave concern to the U.S."" But all these years, Washington has avoided spelling out what it would do in case military clash erupts in the Taiwan Strait. Some observers say such ambiguity serves as a deterrent. Others worry it could lead to miscalculations. That delicate balance lurks at the heart of this weekend's election. Incumbent president Ma Ying Jeou advocates maintaining the status quo. ""Ma Ying Jeou will continue the 1992 Consensus,"" says Tsinghua University professor Yan Xuetong. ""If he does that we can maintain the current relationship across the Strait."" If Ma wins, says Wang Jianmin, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) in Beijing, ""we can hopefully keep the 'peaceful development' scenario with the mutual trust based on the 1992 Consensus."" Beijing's policy-makers are wary of Tsai Ing-wen, suspecting her of pushing a pro-independence agenda. Tsai for one rejects the 1992 Consensus and instead calls for a yet undefined ""Taiwan Consensus."" Jia Qingling, a top communist party official who oversees Taiwan affairs, recently warned: ""If we deny the status quo there is no way to carry on any further negotiations, and what we have achieved so far would be in vain. We would go back to the days of chaos and uncertainty."" But Wang believes relations between Beijing and Taipei will see a drastic change if DPP gets elected. ""There is no way China will keep the current level of talks if Taiwan claims itself to be a country,"" he says. ""If so, Taiwan's economy will certainly decline if the life blood from the mainland gets cut off."" But Tsinghua's Yan Xuetong downplays any worst-case scenarios. ""Even if Tsai Ing Wen wins the election, she will adopt a moderate policy to mainland China,"" he opines. There are good reasons not to rock the boat, mostly money. Closer ties between Taiwan and the mainland, observers say, have brought significant ""peace dividends"" to both sides -- robust business and trade, tourism, academic and people-to-people exchanges and family reunions. Two-way trade last year topped U.S.$160 billion, according to estimates by China's customs bureau. Over the years, Taiwanese investors, big and small, have pumped billions of dollars of investment into China. Last year alone, they invested over U.S.$12 billion in 520 projects on the mainland, according to a report by the state-run Xinhua new agency. Mainland companies, on the other hand, invested U.S.$174 million into over 200 projects in Taiwan in the short time since Taiwan allowed mainland investments in June 2009, Xinhua said. Since Taiwan opened its borders to mainland tourists three-and-a-half years ago, says Shao Qiwei, head of China's tourism agency, over three million mainlanders have visited the island. Last year alone, 1.8 million joined tours or went as individual travelers, Shao added. In contrast, about five million Taiwanese tourists visited the mainland last year, according to National Tourism Administration. But for the Communist leadership in Beijing closer ties also poses a downside: they bring a democratic contagion to the mainland. On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, Linghutian writes: ""No matter who wins, it's the victory of Taiwan's voters and the democracy they've been practicing. We mainlanders should just stay calm and learn something, since we now can't really do much."" While the Taiwanese electorate is able to directly elect their president and other leaders this weekend, China's political elite is still struggling behind closed doors to reach a consensus on who among them will take top positions ahead of the major political transition later this year. In the autumn, Vice President Xi Jinping, 58, is expected to replace 69-year-old Hu Jintao as party chief when the Communist Party holds its national congress -- an event that takes place every five years. Xi is expected to formally ascend as state president when China's legislature convenes in the spring of 2013.","Incumbent president Ma Ying Jeou of the ruling Kuomintang Party seeking another four-year term .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Director Sam Taylor-Johnson has been chosen to film ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" the best-selling erotic novel about a 27-year-old billionaire and a naÃ¯ve college student, Universal Pictures said Wednesday. Taylor-Johnson, a British photographer and visual artist, garnered laurels as a director in 2009 when she made ""Nowhere Boy"" about John Lennon's young life. The film raised her profile as the movie received four BAFTA nominations, including one for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer, and another for outstanding British film. She later married the film's star, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is 23 years her junior. Last year, writer Kelly Marcel was selected to write the screenplay adaption of the book by British author Erika Leonard, who wrote the novel under the pen name E L James. Marcel is also known for her work on the Amblin/FOX-TV series ""Terra Nova."" ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" relates a young woman's sexually explicit liaisons with the young billionaire. The story is part of a trilogy. The trilogy has been translated in 45 languages and sold more than 32 million copies in the United States.

"(CNN) -- A year to the day after winning Manchester City's first championship in nearly half a century, coach Roberto Mancini was sacked as the club's ambitious Abu Dhabi owners finally lost patience with the Italian. The 48-year-old Mancini's dismissal follows City's shock FA Cup defeat by Wigan on Saturday and their inability to defend the English Premier League title the club won last season, with rivals Manchester United running away with the league this season. ""Despite everyone's best efforts, the club has failed to achieve any of its stated targets this year, with the exception of qualification for next season's UEFA Champions League,"" said a City statement. ""This, combined with an identified need to develop a holistic approach to all aspects of football at the club, has meant that the decision has been taken to find a new manager for the 2013/14 season and beyond."" Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan completed a reported $300 million takeover in 2008 and has spent millions more in making City, who will finish second this season, into a major force in the Premier League. After buying City, Sheikh Mansour invested more than $600 million on players like Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Carlos Tevez, and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors Manchester United to the title on goal difference last season. Mancini's dismissal comes a year to the day since City beat Queens Park Rangers to win its first top-flight title in 44 years and nearly two years to the day since he won the club's first trophy in 35 years, when beating Stoke City in the 2011 FA Cup final. Yet the club did not make it out of their Champions League group this season, becoming the first English side to fail to win any of its six matches during the group phase of the competition. The buildup to the FA Cup had been overshadowed with widespread rumors that Mancini, who signed a five year deal last July, would be replaced by former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, who guided Malaga to this year's Champions League quarterfinals. ""This has been a difficult decision for the owner, chairman and board to make and it is the outcome of a planned end of season review process that has been brought forward in light of recent speculation and out of respect for Roberto and his extensive contributions to the football club,"" added the City statement. On Sunday night, Pellegrini told Malaga's website that he had not lined up any move to become Manchester City's next coach. ""I categorically deny I am the new Manchester City coach, nothing has been signed and no agreement reached,"" said the Chilean. ""I've been fortunate enough, and am very proud, that every year the big clubs are interested in me. I have an agreement with Malaga not to talk to anyone and nothing has been agreed with any other outfit."" City's assistant manager Brian Kidd has been placed in charge for the remaining two games of the season and the club's post-season tour to the United States before a permanent manager is appointed. ""Roberto's record speaks for itself and he has the respect and gratitude of Sheikh Mansour, myself and the Board for all of his hard work and commitment over the last three and a half years,"" said chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak in the City statement. ""He has clearly also secured the love and respect of our fans. He has done as he promised and delivered silverware and success, breaking the club's 35-year trophy drought and securing the title in 2012. ""I would like to personally and publicly thank him for his dedication to the progress that he has overseen and for his support and continued friendship."" City's sacking of Mancini came on the day United held a victory parade to mark their 20th league title and Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, an event that drew thousands of fans on to the streets of the English north west city. Mancini leaves with the fourth highest win percentage of any manager in the Premier League, a record bettered only by former Chelsea coaches Jose Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti, as well as Ferguson himself. The trophies aside, Mancini's time at City is likely to be remembered for several rows with star players, most notably Carlos Tevez and Mario Balotelli, and for engineering Manchester United's worst home defeat in 56 years as City won 6-1 at Old Trafford, the first time the Red Devils had conceded six goals at home since 1930. A former coach of Inter Milan, Mancini was appointed in December 2009 after the club sacked Mark Hughes and was afforded millions to spend in the transfer market by the club's oil-rich owners. Last August, the Manchester club appointed former Barcelona board member Ferran Soriano as their new chief executive, while in October City appointed former Barcelona technical director Txiki Begiristain as their director of football.","Manchester City sack Mancini for failing to 'achieve club's stated aims'

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova only wanted to talk tennis after coming through a testing opening match at Wimbledon Monday against promising young French player Kristina Mladenovic. The Russian's pre-tournament spat with Serena Williams dominated the buildup to the grass court grand slam, but she did not want to add further fuel to the flames. ""I've said everything that I wanted to say about the issue. Wimbledon started. This is my work. This is my job. I'd really appreciate it if we move on,"" she told gathered reporters. ""Our job is to go out on the court and work and try to win matches and nothing else. That's the most important thing to me in my life right now."" Third seed Sharapova had been forced to give all her attention to her Centre Court clash with Mladenovic, taken to a close first set tiebreak. Mladenovic, the 2009 Girls Champion at Wimbledon, continued to impress, but a single break for 2004 champion Sharapova saw her into the second round. She will play Michelle Larcher de Brit after the Portuguese beat Melanie Oudin of the United States. Second seed Victoria Azarenka, the winner of the Australian Open, beat another Portuguese player, Maria Joao Koehler, 6-1, 6-2. But the 23-year-old Belarusian suffered a worrying injury scare in the second set, collapsing to the grass in agony while serving as her right leg gave away. The match was delayed for over 10 minutes while she had it strapped, but she recovered to earn a clash with Italian Flavia Pennetta. But Pennetta's compatriot and fifth seed Sara Errani exited with a 6-3, 6-2 defeat to Puerto Rican teenager Monica Puig. 2011 champion Czech Petra Kvitova was extended by American Coco Vandeweghe, dropping the second set on the way to a far from routine 6-1 5-7 6-4 victory.

"(CNN) -- While I was working in Colombia many years ago, a young boy said to me: ""The day we take peace as seriously as a football match, we will achieve it."" His words were simple, yet they carried profound implications: Football can inspire the passion needed to change the world. This encounter also taught me another important lesson: The best ideas come from listening to people and communities. Why football should be used to change lives . Today, these two ideas form the basis of streetfootballworld's work across all five continents. We believe in the power of football to change lives -- and we believe that the power to change communities lies in the communities themselves. The capacity for social change that lies within the streetfootballworld network is immense -- but how can it be maximized? READ MORE: Building on the BRICS . Russia is one country which has huge potential to action change leading up to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which it will host. It must prepare a strategy which delivers a lasting social legacy for its people. In the 2018 Local Organizing Committee's recent annual report, CEO Alexei Sorokin emphasized the importance of creating a sustainable long term legacy. While we fully support this sentiment, our experience shows that it requires careful preparation and involvement across all stakeholders. Russian football has made headlines with some spectacular investments -- both domestically and on the international stage. If this level of commitment can be transferred to the social sphere, Russia has the potential to lead the way to a pioneering sporting legacy. In this sense, 2018 is a unique opportunity -- and one which it would be a shame to waste. So how can it be done? It has become fashionable to talk about the legacy of large sporting events such as World Cups and Olympic Games. Such events carry with them an enormous potential to create real, lasting social change. But this only works if local needs are at the center of any approach. Streetfootballworld bridges the gap between host communities and organizing committees to ensure this is the case. WATCH MORE: Could the BRICS get a bank? In 2010, streetfootballworld teamed up with FIFA to make social change an integral part of the World Cup. With the construction of 20 community health, education and sport centers as part of the ""20 Centres for 2010"" campaign, the World Cup environment was able to be used to help assist communities across the African continent. These Football for Hope Centres are hosted by community-based organizations, thus impacting target groups, building upon effective programs and responding to local needs. The 2010 initiatives were successful due to a combination of local expertise and global commitment. We showed how an entire continent could be reached. In 2012, streetfootballworld implemented RESPECT your Health, the official community health programme for UEFA EURO 2012 in Poland and Ukraine. Working together with local sports institutions, schools and volunteers, we used the passion for the game to spread important messages about healthy lifestyles via a train-the-trainers approach -- thus multiplying the effect and reaching more young people. READ MORE: Can BRICS nations reshape aviation? Over 800 coaches continued to use the specially designed RESPECT your Health curriculum long after the tournament -- demonstrating that sport (and especially football) is an effective way of guaranteeing a sustainable legacy. Russia must focus on its five year countdown . Similar approaches will be needed if the 2018 World Cup is to make an impact on the vast expanse of Russia. Ahead of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, we're campaigning to give as many people as possible a voice to express what a positive legacy means to them. We are using the momentum of the World Cup to support innovative ideas for change on a local level. A true social legacy is dependent on local ownership and active participation. Like in Brazil, the passion for football is huge in Russia -- and over the next five years, Russia has the chance to show that football can be more than just a game.

"Orlando (CNN) -- When Walt Disney World's New Fantasyland opens Thursday in the Magic Kingdom, guests will be in for a slew of magical moments, and they'll have plenty of room to enjoy them. This portion of the park nearly doubled in size, making it the largest expansion in the park's 41-year history. ""It gives guests another level of immersion,"" says Tom Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. ""We have technology to play with that Walt DIsney didn't have."" For instance, part of the expansion includes Beast's Castle, which sits atop Be Our Guest restaurant. During lunch hours, guests order at touch-screen kiosks and take radio-frequency devices to their tables. Once the pager is placed on the table, servers know exactly where to deliver the food. And voila, meals arrive within minutes via a glass-enclosed cart. ""Everything is fresh, made to order, and for lunch we are hoping for the bustling kind of energy like the movie scene (from 'Beauty and the Beast') in the dining room,"" says Lenny DeGeorge, Walt Disney World executive chef. In the evening, the restaurant transforms into fancy table-service dining, inviting guests to feast upon French onion soup, mussels ProvenÃ§al and charcuterie while sipping on French wines and beers. This is a first, since alcohol has never been served before in the Magic Kingdom. In true Disney style, the decor inside and out is over the top. From the chandeliers to the walls to the terrazzo floor to the draperies, it's all true to the movie. Even suits of armor that whisper to passersby line the hallway. Guests then make their way into the grand ballroom, which has an entire wall of arched windows, complete with magical snowflakes falling upon the French countryside. Faith Lee, from Lake Mary, Florida, appreciates the extreme theming. ""I felt like a kid again entering (Be Our Guest restaurant),"" she says. ""It completely recreates the details of Beast's Castle to the most minute aspect."" Other areas of New Fantasyland involve similar attention to detail, completely immersing guests in the beloved Disney stories. The expansion, which has been in the works for more than three years, introduces two new areas ---- the Enchanted Forest, which focuses on Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid, and Storybook Circus, an area inspired by the Disney animated feature ""Dumbo."" Have you been to New Fantasyland? Share your images . Major focus on character time . Outside, to the far left of Beast's Castle is Maurice's Cottage, a provincial abode that houses an enchanted mirror. It spectacularly transforms into a portal whisking guests into the story of Beauty and the Beast. Once in the Beast's library, Enchanted Tales with Belle goes way beyond a typical meet and greet when Belle and friends invite guests to help act out the ""tale as old as time."" Next door at Prince Eric's Castle, kids and adults alike will enjoy Under the Sea - Journey of the Little Mermaid (almost identical to the Disney California Adventure version). After walking through an interactive queue, guests board giant clamshells as animation and animatronics retell Ariel's story. Afterward in Ariel's Grotto, guests score one-on-one time with the redheaded mermaid herself as she poses for photos and signs autographs. ""For us, the Fantasyland expansion was more than we could have imagined,"" Lee says. ""It was like being immersed in the stories of Belle and Ariel, not just visiting attractions."" Lee and her family were also impressed with Storybook Circus, which opened over the summer. This portion of the park includes a water play area, tame roller coaster and gift shop. The revamped Dumbo ride, with its new indoor queue lounge, is a crowd pleaser for parents who want to sit down for a bit and children who want to enjoy an elaborate playground. Guests receive a pager that virtually holds their place in line; it lights up when it's time to board the ride. Another option is to grab a FastPass and wait in a traditional line outdoors. Overall, the new additions certainly have Disney fans aflutter, but will this translate to an influx of Orlando visitors? Danielle Courtenay, chief marketing officer for Visit Orlando, thinks so. ""When any major new attraction opens in Orlando, there's always a positive impact in terms of increased awareness and interest in the destination,"" she says. ""With New Fantasyland being the largest expansion in Magic Kingdom history, we are certainly optimistic that it will impact visitation for 2013 and beyond."" Coming soon . Princess Fairytale Hall is scheduled to open in 2013 in the former home of Snow White's Scary Adventures. Located in the Castle Courtyard in the center of Fantasyland, it will be a place for guests to meet Disney princess characters. Come early 2014, the finishing touch will be a roller coaster, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, in the heart of it all. This family thrill ride will be an experience somewhere in between the tame Barnstormer, a re-themed ""beginner's coaster,"" and the classic Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. With its patented train of vehicles that swing back and forth, the attraction will be the first of its kind. Have you visited Disney World recently? Please share your experiences and tips in the comments section below.","Walt Disney World's New Fantasyland officially opens December 6 .

"(CNN) -- Egypt moved closer to a first World Cup finals appearance since 1990 after reaching the African qualification playoffs on Sunday. The Pharaohs, coached by American Bob Bradley, notched a fifth successive victory in Group G, beating Mozambique 1-0 in Maputo thanks to a 40th-minute goal from young striker Mohamed Salah. Salah, who turned 21 on Saturday and plays for Swiss club Basel, scored a hat-trick last weekend against Zimbabwe -- and also netted last year against Guinea. It marks a big turnaround in fortunes for the continent's seven-time champion, which failed to qualify for the last two Africa Cup of Nations and suspended its domestic league for a year after more than 70 fans died in the Port Said tragedy in February 2012. Guinea's hopes of a World Cup debut were ended despite winning 2-0 against Zimbabwe, with striker Mohamed Yattara scoring both goals. The Ivory Coast also went through to the playoffs, winning 4-2 away to Tanzania to be sure of topping Group C. Two-time African player of the year Yaya Toure scored two first-half goals to help his team come from behind, and substitute Wilfried Bony sealed victory in time added on. It meant Morocco missed out, despite winning 2-0 against Gambia on Saturday. South Africa, the 2010 World Cup host, also failed to make the playoffs after losing 2-1 to Group A winner Ethiopia thanks to a 70th-minute headed own-goal by Bernard Parker. Parker had put his side ahead in the first half but Getaneh Kebede equalized before the break to join Salah and Algeria's Islam Slimani on a leading five goals in the qualifiers. Ethiopia, which played at the Africa Cup of Nations in January for the first time in 30 years, has never gone to the World Cup. However, it is facing a FIFA investigation after being accused of fielding an ineligible player in last Saturday's 2-1 win away to Botswana. If it is found guilty, South Africa and Botswana could have another chance to go through. Football's world governing body has opened similar proceedings against Togo and Equatorial Guinea -- neither of which have reached the playoffs, but the outcome could affect the qualifiers from their respective groups. Ghana reached the quarterfinals in South Africa three years ago, and the Black Stars are on course for a third successive appearance after beating Lesotho 2-0 in Maseru. Christian Atsu and captain Asamoah Gyan.scored in either half to put Ghana one point ahead of Zambia in Group D ahead of their clash in the final round in September. Zambia stuttered with a 1-1 draw at home to Sudan on Saturday. Tunisia claimed a playoff place as winner of Group B after drawing 1-1 in Equatorial Guinea, with Sierra Leone's slim hopes having been ended by a 1-0 defeat against Cape Verde. Cameroon's hopes of a seventh World Cup outing hang in the balance following Sunday's 0-0 draw away to the Democratic Republic of Congo. With star striker Samuel Eto'o out injured, the Indomitable Lions dropped two points behind Group I leader Libya ahead of their clash in the last match. Libya beat Togo 2-0 on Friday. Algeria will try to earn a fourth World Cup appearance after reaching the playoffs with a 1-0 win in Rwanda, as Saphir Taider netted the only goal in the 52nd minute to seal top spot in Group H. Mali needed to beat Benin to delay the Desert Foxes' progress, but drew 2-2 at home after needing a second-half equalizer from striker Cheick Diabate. Senegal returned to the top of Group J with a 2-0 win away to Liberia, as striker Papiss Cisse scored in either half. It set up a last-round showdown with Uganda, a point back in second following Saturday's 2-1 win at home to Angola. Malawi's hopes of overhauling Group F leader Nigeria were dented by a 2-2 home draw against bottom team Kenya. Nigeria's Super Eagles hold a two-point lead ahead of the September 6 home clash with Malawi. The 10-team playoffs will take place over two legs in October and November, with the five winners earning a place in Brazil next year.","Egypt through to African World Cup qualifying playoffs after beating Mozambique 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- In China, it is sometimes the doctors who call for medical help. In Beijing last month, an angry patient left a female doctor with 17 stab wounds. Wang Baoming, a cancer patient, allegedly attacked Dr. Xu Wen with a kitchen knife, wounding her arms, left leg and back. Fortunately, she survived after nine hours in surgery. Wang is now under arrest. He reportedly attacked the 43-year-old surgeon because he deemed her attempt to remove his laryngeal tumor in 2006 a failure that made his condition worse. The suspected assailant had complained about it in his blog. ""It was supposed to be a minor operation which can cure my illness once and for all,"" he wrote as early as April 2009. ""Because of the destructive surgery by Mrs. Xu, within three months the scattered cancer cells spread."" He was left a disabled man, he wrote, and wanted to take revenge on Xu. This is not an isolated case, the Chinese media and medical industry sources say. Caixin, a muck-raking Chinese weekly, said at least eight similar cases have occurred this year. In August, a patient in Guangdong province, reportedly hacked to death Dr. Liu Zhonglin and injured another doctor who tried to stop the attack. The patient claimed the doctor failed to cure him of facial spasms, state-run Xinhua said. ""This has been going on for a long time,"" said an American consultant familiar with China's medical sector, who requested anonymity. ""Doctors are frequently attacked and the professional morale is very low."" Chinese doctors are asking for understanding and help. On September 16, the Chinese Medical Doctors Association issued a statement urging the Chinese public to show more respect to doctors. ""The government should attach importance to the rising tensions between doctors and patients, and think about what caused the current situation,"" said Deng Liqiang, head of the association's legal department. In August, the association released the results of a nationwide survey. Of the 3,704 doctors who responded, 91.9% said their job involves many sacrifices for low pay, the China Daily reported. Why have doctors become victims of violence? Some 55.6% of respondents said the society is simply prejudiced against the medical profession, 23.5% of doctors did not properly communicate with their patients and 20.6% said treatment cannot meet patients' high expectations. In the early 1980s, as part of Deng Xiaoping's reform and open-door program, China extended its market reforms to health care. Hospitals were stripped of government subsidies and forced to become financially self-supporting. The assumption was the market would move in and take care of the problems. Since then, however, China's health care system has fallen behind the country's rapid socio-economic growth. Observers say hospitals are now typically underfunded and doctors are under-paid. ""Hospitals here are often understaffed and have to cater to large number of patients,"" noted an Asian physician who works in a Beijing hospital. ""I visited a friend one night in the Beijing Children's Hospital to help interpret for her. The lines were long and there were two doctors on duty at the ER. Since the lines were long, the quality of care leaves much to be desired. The doctors hardly have time to do a thorough check up,"" the physician said. Deregulation of the health care sector has led to accusations of profiteering by hospitals, doctors, drug companies. In some cases, according to various reports by Chinese media, hospitals have reportedly demanded that patients pay much of their likely bill before treatment. In others, some doctors were said to demand red envelopes - containing cash - before treating patients. Chinese blogger ""Songst557"" observed: ""We've heard it so many times that if a patient does not bribe his doctor, there is high probability that his surgery would not be successful. It's also a common knowledge that even patients who had given bribes still worry if they gave enough bribes. With such severe anxiety added to their painful illness, even the normally failed surgery would be deemed abnormal."" Doctors and would-be doctors complain that the burden of proof is one-sidedly put on their side. ""Only China adopts a 'reverse onus' principle in dealing with doctor-patient disputes, which assumes that doctors are guilty and are asked for evidence to prove their innocence,"" said Chen Xue, a resident at the Peking Medical University Hospital. ""This is quite ironic."" ""Of course, overburdened case-loads and relatively low official pay may actually contribute to practitioners unmotivated to show compassion, but there is also a sense of entitlement on the part of patients,"" added the American consultant. China is now considering administrative and legal mechanisms to deal with doctor-patient disputes. Meanwhile, observers say the situation is demoralizing doctors and doctors-in-training, prompting a kind of brain drain. ""That is partially why some talent are going abroad and some are defecting to become pharmaceutical and device sales people,"" said the consultant. ""With relatively low salaries and little respect it seems less young people are interested in studying medicine."" Chen Xue, who is in his final year at Peking University's medical school, says he will stick to his medical career. ""To guarantee our safety,"" he said, ""we now need to observe carefully to avoid patients who are hard to deal with and if we encounter any disputes, we need to be alert about our own safety."" Chen says he loves his career and enjoys helping patients. ""That's why we are willing to take the risk under the current circumstances,"" said the 26-year-old Chen.","In Beijing a patient left a female doctor with 17 stab wounds .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Many of China's Catholics are awaiting the election of Pope Benedict XVI's successor with high expectations. ""We pray for the new pope,"" said Father Francis Zhang, a Beijing priest. ""We hope he will be spiritual, dynamic and open minded. We hope he will be more open to China, more pragmatic, and someone who understands very well the Chinese Catholic church."" In recent days, Father Zhang, the parish priest of the Yongning Catholic church in the northern suburbs of the capital, has been travelling to several Chinese cities, giving lectures to jam-packed audiences of priests, seminarians and laymen. ""Sometimes the audience is as big as 4,000 people,"" he enthused. ""I talk about religion and church management."" Chinese Catholics like Zhang have long been caught in the middle of a decades-long conflict between China's Communist Party and the Vatican. They are walking a fine line between loyalty to the Holy See and to their country. ""Of course we believe in one holy, Catholic and apostolic church,"" Zhang said. ""We are in total union with the Holy See in terms of liturgy, theology, holy communion and rites. ""As a Chinese priest, we love our country, the motherland. We are law-abiding."" China today remains largely atheist under the rule of the Communist Party. Even so, churches like Zhang's have been attracting old believers and new converts. China's State Administration for Religious Affairs says some six million Chinese Catholics attend services in government-sanctioned churches, but others practice their faith in secret -- in Catholic churches outside government control. ""Many of them are still going to the underground churches,"" said Father Zhang. Experts say millions worship in underground churches -- so-called ""house-churches"" that are fiercely loyal to the Vatican and disagree with government restrictions and periodic crackdowns. After the 1949 revolution, the ruling Communist Party denounced religion as the ""opiate"" of the masses. China cut off ties with the Vatican in 1951 and the two sides have been estranged ever since. Religious persecution reached a crescendo during the chaotic Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when clergy and laymen alike were persecuted, jailed and even killed. In the early 1970s, I remember walking by what looked like churches in central Beijing. They were padlocked or used as workshops or warehouses. Religion remained taboo. A few years after Chairman Mao's death in 1976, China reopened ""patriotic churches"" where people can practice religion under government control. More than thirty years of reform has turned China into the second biggest economy in the world. It also has one of the fastest growing Christian communities in the world. With less strict adherence to communist ideology, many Chinese appeared spirtually adrift, looking for a value system on which to anchor their lives as they cope with rampant materialism, money-worship and widespread corruption. Many turn to religion for solace. ""They are looking for peace and stability, for spiritual purification,"" said Father Zhang. Last autumn, I watched Zhang preside over an elaborate wedding of 62 couples from across China. Most were newly married; others were older couples renewing their vows. I asked one groom, a white-collar worker in Beijing, ""Why turn Catholic?"" ""Religion helps people, young and old, draw a red line between what is moral and proper, and what is not,"" he answered. Zhang says local officials approve of religion too because it helps improve social stability. ""It promotes social harmony,"" echoing the Chinese leadership's political slogan. China says citizens now enjoy religious freedom, as enshrined in the constitution -- but it comes with caveats. The regulations, Human Rights Watch notes, require that religious organizations and believers must ""safeguard the nation's unity, ethnic solidarity, and social stability"" and eschew ""foreign domination."" Religious activities should observe the constitution, laws and regulations, and safeguard the nation's unity, ethnic solidarity, and social stability. No organizations or individuals should interfere with the state's administration, the judiciary, or education. International rights groups complain that Chinese officials continue to detain religious believers, close religious sites, and impose arbitrary restrictions. Over the past eight years during Pope Benedict's papacy, the two sides have made attempts to break the impasse but only with modest success. In 2005, Pope Benedict met with members of the China Disabled People's Arts Troupe who were touring Rome at the time. In a pastoral letter issued on May 20, 2007, the pope expressed understanding about the complicated situation of the church in China and offered guidelines for pastoral life. He expressed a ""willingness to engage in respectful and constructive dialogue"" with China, while calling for defense of the doctrines and tradition of the Catholic Church. The pope, in the letter, also dedicated May 24 as a day of prayer for the church in China - and in the same year set up a special commission on affairs related to the church in the country. In 2008, the Chinese Philharmonic Orchestra and the Shanghai Opera House Chorus visited the Vatican and performed in front of the pope. It was hailed as an ice-breaking event. Still, major sticking points remain. While China may allow Chinese Catholics to practice their faith and accept the pope's spiritual leadership, it also tells the Vatican not to ""interfere in China's internal affairs,"" including the matter of ordaining Chinese bishops. China in recent years has ordained new bishops without the pope's approval, stalling efforts of restoring diplomatic relations between China and the Vatican. Many local Catholics, caught in the middle, say they hope the government will respect the universal traditions of the Vatican. At the same time, they hope the Vatican can better understand the church in China and reach reconciliation with Beijing. ""We follow China and we also follow the Roman Catholic way,"" said Father Zhang, who for years attended an underground church before joining the mainstream ""patriotic church."" But no breakthroughs are expected any time soon. The incoming pope will have little room to tweak the ""ambiguous but still conservative line"" pursued by Pope Benedict because the hardliners in the Vatican are simply too strong, said one analyst who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity surrounding religious issues in China. If the new pope takes a more conciliatory line on China, he added, his credibility could be questioned by the hardliners. Chinese communist leaders, on the other hand, are still struggling with how to deal with this unpredictable religious boom.","Catholic Church and government authorities uneasily coexist in China .

"(CNN) -- Andy Murray has spent much of the past few weeks watching the action unfold on the television -- but the World No.2 says his injury-enforced absence has rekindled his passion for tennis. The Briton, who reached the final at Wimbledon last year, returned to Queen's Club Thursday to finish off his rain delayed game with Nicolas Mahut before sweeping aside Australia's Marinko Matosevic 6-2 6-2 in 56 minutes. And after shrugging off a recurrence of the back injury which he suffered at the Rome Masters in May, Murray is far more grateful for the time he spends on court after being forced to withdraw from the French Open. ""I think it can be easy to take things for granted sometimes,"" Murray told reporters. ""You know, I played pretty much every Slam for about seven years and I missed it. It was difficult watching and not being there. ""You realize how much you love competing and you love being around the tournaments. ""When everything is good and you're healthy and you're playing every week you don't often think about it that much. ""And when you're away from it and you miss one of the biggest tournaments, one of the tournaments you prepare extremely hard for and put the hard work in for, then it's tough. ""I was really looking forward to getting back on the court again and hopefully I can have a good week."" Murray was beaten by Roger Federer in the final at Wimbledon just over 12 months ago but got revenge on the Swiss by taking Olympic gold in fine fashion. And after coming through the best part of two games in a single day, the 26-year-old is confident he's well on the way to regaining full fitness. ""I feel good. That was what was most pleasing about the matches,"" Murray said. ""There was a lot of stops and starts on Wednesday, having to warm up and cool down and stuff. ""But everything felt good and I woke up this morning with no real stiffness, which is good. ""I thought I moved pretty well. Normally the first couple of matches here the court is quite slippery, and that's something I have struggled with the last few years. ""This time I haven't slipped down once. That has been a good sign."" Murray, who will be back on court Friday to face Germany's Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, added: ""I probably feel a bit more confident coming into this grass court season because of how I played on it last year. ""I think because I managed to win some big matches and play well on the grass last year, I know what I did well and what I need to keep doing."" Elsewhere, Lleyton Hewitt continued his impressive run of form with a 5-7 6-3 6-4 win over American Sam Querrey. Hewitt, 32, will face former U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro, who needed less than an hour to see off British wildcard Dan Evans. Second seed Tomas Berdych eased through to the last eight with a 6-3 6-4 win over Slovenia's Grega Zemlja and will now face defending champion Marin Cilic. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was forced to play two three set matches in one day to book his place in the quarterfinals and a meeting with America's Denis Kudla. Tsonga, seeded fourth, defeated fellow Frenchman, Edouard Roger-Vasselin 6-3 6-7 6-3 early Thursday before seeing off Dutchman Igor Sijsling 7-5 5-7 6-3. Elsewhere, Tommy Haas continued the defense of his title at the Halle Open by reaching the last eight with a straight sets win over Ernests Gulbis. Haas will play Gael Monfils for a place in the last eight. There were also wins for 2011 champion Philipp Kohlschreiber and France's Richard Gasquet.","Andy Murray thrilled to be back in action after missing French Open .

"(CNN) -- Germany's justice minister has asked the UK government whether German citizens have been affected by mass surveillance programs reportedly carried out by UK and U.S. authorities. Germany needs ""a swift clarification of the facts and transparency on reported mass surveillance,"" German Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger said in a statement. ""The German Government wants to know whether and to which extent the communication of especially German and European citizens has been and still is affected by British and American surveillance programs."" She has written to her UK counterpart, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, and Home Secretary Theresa May, a spokesman for the German Justice Ministry said Wednesday. A UK Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it would respond to the letter ""in due course."" The UK Home Office said it did not comment on private correspondence. The German government's concern follows allegations in The Guardian newspaper on Friday that the UK equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency, the Government Communications Headquarters, has tapped into many of the world's key international fiber-optic cables and is routinely downloading and analyzing vast quantities of Internet and phone traffic, sharing the data with the NSA. Guardian: UK security agency has spy program; shares data with NSA . The Guardian said its report was based on the reading of documents provided by former U.S. defense contractor Edward Snowden, who admitted leaking documents this month detailing government surveillance programs. The NSA dismissed that report as ""absolutely false,"" and a GCHQ spokesman said it declined to comment on intelligence matters, in line with long-standing practice. The allegations have prompted wide public concern in the United Kingdom and United States. But Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger's statement highlights a broader unease within Europe over the extent of the reported surveillance programs. ""The internet offers great opportunities -- for our citizens' participation and communication, for our economies and for the protection of human rights in general,"" she said. ""But our citizens need to have trust into the new form of communication. Mass surveillance and treating every citizen as potentially suspicious undermines this trust."" The retention of all communications data without any evidence goes against the German Constitution, she said, while increased data protection is ""not an obstacle to an effective fight against terrorism or any other crimes."" An empty debate? Why little will happen to change how we snoop . UK Foreign Secretary William Hague defended UK-U.S. operations in a speech given Tuesday at the Reagan Presidential Library in California, saying that in both countries, a ""strong legal framework"" governs intelligence work. ""We should have nothing but pride in the unique and indispensable intelligence-sharing relationship between Britain and the United States,"" he said. ""We operate under the rule of law and are accountable for it. In some countries, secret intelligence is used to control their people. In ours, it only exists to protect their freedoms. ""We should always remember that terrorists plan to harm us in secret, criminal networks plan to steal from us in secret, foreign intelligence agencies plot to spy on us in secret, and new weapons systems are devised in secret. So we cannot protect the people of our countries without devising some of the response to those threats in secret.""

"(CNN) -- Five days after a British sailor died training in San Francisco Bay, America's Cup organizers announced Tuesday that the historic race will go on. The affirmation that racing will proceed, as planned, follows the death Thursday of 36-year-old Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson. Attempts were made to revive the British Olympic sailor at sea and on land after his 72-foot Artemis Racing boat capsized in the waters off northern California. The other 10 members of the boat's crew were all safely rescued, Sweden's Artemis Racing said. The incident brought into question what would happen with the America's Cup, a yacht race that began in 1851 off the English coast. Its website bills the competition as a quest for the ""oldest trophy in international sport."" On that website, America's Cup organizers ""confirmed that this summer's events remain on track."" That means no change in the start time of the Louis Vuitton Cup -- the America's Cup Challenger Series -- set for July 7 and the America's Cup Finals scheduled to begin on September 7 off San Francisco. ""The America's Cup will go ahead this summer,"" said Tom Ehman, vice commodore of the Golden Gate Yacht Club. ""We will see the world's best sailors racing at the highest level."" Yet the aftermath of Simpson's death was still part of the race's news release and a related news conference. Specifically, race organizers on Tuesday detailed who will be on a safety review committee that's been created in the past few days. Among others, the group will include two-time U.S. Sailing Yachtswoman of the Year Sally Lindsay Honey, race executive and former Canadian Olympic coach John Craig and French boat designer Vincent Lauriot Prevost. Lt. Jon Lane, a 26-year veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, will serve as a liaison to the group. A day earlier, the America's Cup explained that the panel will ""review all aspects and training of AC72 yachts."" AC72s are a class of boat -- specifically 72-foot catamarans, like the one Simpson was on -- that are set to compete in the upcoming America's Cup. The committee will issue its report ""as soon as possible,"" mindful of the start of racing in seven weeks, according to the America's Cup website.","Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson died after a 72-foot catamaran capsized in San Francisco Bay .

"(Mashable) -- Mark Zuckerberg says he asked Steve Jobs about how to build a high-quality team and great products, but denies Apple and Facebook ever talked about an acquisition. The revelations come as part of an in-depth interview between PBS's Charlie Rose and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. The extensive interview covers all of the bases, such as whether Facebook will ever build games (no, Zuck says) and what Zuckerberg thinks of Google+ (he calls it ""their own little version of Facebook""). However, the most interesting part of the interview comes when the trio starts discussing Zuckerberg's relationship with Steve Jobs. ""I had a lot of questions for him on how to build a team around you,"" he says in response to one of Rose's questions. ""That's focused on building as high quality and good things as you are. How to keep an organization focused, right, when I think the tendency for larger companies is to try to fray and go into all these different areas."" Zuckerberg professes respect for Apple because, like Facebook, it is out to build a company that will change the world rather than fatten the bottom line. Rose then asks Zuckerberg whether or not the two companies had ever talked about an acquisition. ""No. I don't think it ever really got there,"" he says. ""I mean, nor would I have wanted to sell it."" Sandberg and Zuckerberg then start talking about how Jobs never raised the issue because he understood that Zuckerberg had no interest in selling. We here at Mashable have heard conflicting stories about whether Apple has ever tried to acquire Facebook, but we find it hard to believe the two companies never talked about the issue at some level, whether seriously or just in passing. Sandberg ends the interview with a strong message for women. ""If you survey men and women in college today in this country, the men are more ambitious than the women,"" she says. ""And until women are as ambitious as men, they're not going to achieve as much as men."" Mashable: Bonus! 15 inspirational Steve Jobs quotes . © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- When I visited Princeton University on Monday, I took a walk past the Gothic dormitories on University Place before speaking about my career to a student seminar -- the same one I took 10 years ago. Every time I see the entrance to Foulke Hall, I am overcome with disbelief that my friends and I aren't still students. I consider it a cruel and unusual fact of life that there is a learned student living in my 171 square feet of paradise. But we all had to move on, and I am happy. I'm 29, I live in Atlanta, I work at CNN.com, and I did not marry a Princetonian. Susan Patton's letter to the Daily Princetonian advising female students to find a husband on campus is surprising in its antiquated assumptions, for sure. Democratic strategist and CNN commentator Donna Brazile and others have taken it apart for its focus on marriage over career and its pointedness toward male-female relationships. I don't fault anyone for wanting their college romances to continue, and I know some that have. But in my experience, parts of her letter are out of whack with the realities of college today. I'm sure Princeton was different for the class of 1977, when Patton graduated. There were only 200 women. (Princeton began admitting women only in the fall of 1969!) She wrote that it was seen as ""heresy"" for her to say she wanted to get married and have children. In my generation, the gender breakdown on campus is nearly 50-50, and I never felt even a little unwelcome as a woman. I heard people express the wish to have a career, marriage and children. But it was far from the only thing we talked about. We talked philosophy, politics, religion, diversity, journalism, anthropology and the value of higher education; that's the level of dialogue that I craved when I applied in the first place. Patton writes about how freshman women should be ""a little nicer"" to senior men, as though women never date men younger than themselves in college, and therefore, there are fewer to choose from as each new class graduates. As a freshman, I barely even knew any seniors. I've heard I seemed ""nervous"" and ""spazzy"" in my first year. I lived in fear of sounding stupid, getting subpar grades and locking myself into a major I didn't like. I was probably less emotionally prepared to have a serious relationship than at any other time in my college career. Seven years after graduation, I understand how difficult a college marriage, the kind Patton suggests, could be. Many of my good friends from Princeton are in Ph.D. programs across the country or are practicing lawyers or doctors, teachers or nonprofit administrators or, like me, journalists. In order to have those great careers, though, a lot of us had to move around. We had to take jobs or attend graduate programs that were very far away from our idyllic New Jersey town and far away from each other. I know some Princeton couples who did the long-distance thing and are now engaged or married. Let's be clear: They didn't get married in college, but the hard work of balancing two careers in flux can work out. Personally, I couldn't have done it. Distance is painful. New surroundings change people. Time changes people. Other people change people. This is not a Princeton problem. This is a 22-year-old problem. There is this truth in Patton's letter: When you live in close proximity to thousands of other people your age, it's not unreasonable to hope that you will meet at least one other person who captures both your heart and mind. Intelligence is sexy, so a lot of really smart people are going to casually hook up or date or both. Princeton is a place that brings together some of the most fascinating people I have ever encountered. Joyce Carol Oates gave me advice on my novel. Peter Singer taught me about animal cruelty. Science writer Michael Lemonick got me interested in what I do today. I got useful sex advice from Dr. Ruth Westheimer. The experiences we had at Princeton do change our lives. They inspire inside jokes among friends and lovers that seem annoying or absurd to anyone else and make us think that we will always maintain some connection. The school inspires a longing to return to that beautiful time when we were surrounded by thousands of people our age who also loved to learn. About 20,000 alumni come back to Princeton for Reunions every year, a testament to the memories of ""Old Nassau."" Princeton is also notorious for breeding life partnerships. Pick up any copy of the Princeton Alumni Weekly magazine and you'll see the latest wave of marriage announcements. Love that happens in college can be incredibly powerful, solidified by uninterrupted time spent together and shared academic and social bliss. But it's not everything. I met my college sweetheart after my junior year, when I had been taking five classes per semester, running two campus magazines, writing for other publications and tutoring a second-grader. I literally planned every hour of every weekday except six hours of sleep. He was two years younger -- scandalous! -- and he respected me for all of my efforts. He even recognized my name from The Nassau Weekly. I'd like to let you all in on a little secret: If you are following your intellectual passions, that itself makes you attractive. But don't do it to meet other people. Do it for yourself. If I had married my college sweetheart, I would have dragged him to Atlanta, a city without the think tanks and rigorous public policy programs where he would thrive. Or I would have moved somewhere for him, and given these uncertain times in journalism, it is unclear whether I would have stayed in the field I love. Inside the Princeton bubble, this may seem improbable, but you can find fascinating people who did not go to Princeton or any schools atop the U.S. News & World Report rankings. I know smart, funny people without four-year degrees. I have wonderful friends with great careers with degrees from non-elite schools. In fact, I have been dating one of these amazing people for five years -- longer than a Princeton education. Disregarding the language in Patton's letter that's offensive to some, it's really not revolutionary. Of course, many people want to find their life partner in college. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say: It's OK to want to find your life partner in college. You're also going to be OK if you don't find your life partner there. A true life partner is going to admire you for following your own intellectual or career passions anyway, so don't change yourself for someone else. Potential life partners are findable -- even ones, as Patton says, ""worthy of you."" I still miss my dorm, though, and I'm totally going to Reunions. Elizabeth Landau is on Twitter at @lizlandau.

"(CNN) -- The fertilizer blamed for the massive explosion that devastated a Texas town in April was kept in wooden bins, in a wooden building, with no sprinklers nearby. And that fell within the existing safety rules for handling ammonium nitrate, a ""patchwork"" of regulations, recommendations and guidance ""that has many large holes,"" the head of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board told a Senate committee Thursday. The federal agency hasn't found any regulations ""that prohibit or discourage many of the factors that likely contributed"" to the April 17 explosion in West, Texas, the board's chairman, Rafael Moure-Eraso, told the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. A fire at the West Fertilizer Company led to an ammonium nitrate explosion that devastated the small town south of Dallas and killed 15 people, most of them firefighters and paramedics. The blast showed up on seismographs as a small earthquake and flattened or damaged dozens of homes, two schools and a nursing home nearby. ""Facilities like West fall outside the existing process safety standards, which were developed in the 1990s,"" Moure-Eraso said. Sprinklers aren't required until a company is storing 2,500 tons of ammonium nitrate, he said. And while industry groups have recommended fire safety standards, Texas has no statewide fire codes and most of its counties can't adopt their own. ""So at West, these fire code provisions were strictly voluntary, and West Fertilizer had not volunteered,"" he said. Ammonium nitrate is a widely used fertilizer with a notorious reputation as an explosive. The bomb used to blow up the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 people, was made mostly ammonium nitrate. Moure-Eraso said the Chemical Safety Board urged the Environmental Protection Agency in 2002 to require non-combustible storage bins for reactive chemicals like ammonium nitrate, but the EPA hasn't done that. The committee's chairwoman, California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, said she will be pressuring the EPA to enact those rules. ""That was a very prescient call, and it didn't happen,"" Boxer told Barry Breen, the head of the EPA's emergency response arm. The EPA's current guidance for handling ammonium ntirate dates back to 1997, ""and I feel that EPA has to step up to the plate here and do a lot more."" Breen said that guidance ""is posted on our website now and continues to be vital."" And he told Boxer the EPA is studying ""a number of potential policy options"" in response to the West disaster, but he wouldn't say when those steps would be taken. ""In order to establish that time frame, we need to understand that issue better, and that's what we're doing now,"" he said. West Fertilizer was covered under federal workplace safety rules for handling ammonium nitrate, Sam Mannan, a chemical engineering professor at Texas A&M University, told the committee. If they had followed those rules, ""My guess is the probability of this incident would have been almost none,"" he said. But the last time the Occupational Safety and Health Administration inspected West Fertilizer was in 1985, when it fined the company $30 over its handling of anhydrous ammonia, another fertilizer it sold. ""Until we come up with a regime where we are doing the enforcement comprehensively, in a manner that yields good results, we're not going to accomplish anything. We just add another legislation that doesn't get enforced,"" Mannan said. With a budget of $10.6 million and a current staff of 42, the Chemical Safety Board investigates chemical accidents and makes recommendations to prevent future ones. The board is also investigating the June 13 explosion at a chemical plant in Geismar, Louisiana, that killed two people and injured more than 100. The agency has a lengthy backlog of cases and ""no capacity at this point to undertake any new investigative work,"" he said. West Fertilizer had been cited by federal regulators twice in the seven years before the blast, including a $5,250 fine for storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels. Since the explosion, Texas officials have announced plans for an online database that will allow residents to view local facilities that hold hazardous materials. Meanwhile, the town has sued the company that sold ammonium nitrate to West Fertilizer, arguing it ""blindly"" supplied the chemical to a firm that didn't handle it properly.","West Fertilizer didn't have to have fireproof bins or sprinklers, investigator says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Miami Heat superstar LeBron James on Thursday led the reigning NBA champions into the first of two pre-season matches staged in China against the Los Angeles Clippers. He lived up to the considerable hype that surrounds him. Just a few minutes into the game, James made five straight points, punctuated by a big dunk, to the delight of the thousands of Chinese fans who packed the arena in Beijing chanting ""MVP, MVP!"" The man dubbed by many as the world's top player notched 20 points, as the Heat beat the Clippers 94-80. The two teams will play again on Sunday in Shanghai. Local fans here were treated to an NBA-style mix of basketball and entertainment, featuring cheerleaders, mascots and DJs egging the crowds to applaud and do ""the wave."" James is well-known in China for being part of the Team USA that won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Basketball-mad Chinese fans watch him regularly in NBA games televised by local sports channels here. In an exclusive interview with Talk Asia, scheduled to air on CNN soon, James noted the Chinese love for the game. ""Here in China they haven't seen the game up close and personal the way we have in the States,"" he said. ""They're always excited about the game, no matter where it's played, no matter how it's played, what level it's played at and you can have a great deal of respect for that. ""This is my ninth time in this country and every city I've been to has welcomed me with open arms,"" he added. ""Either playing a game of basketball, teaching or inspiring the game of basketball, there's been some great opportunities for me and there have been some great times with the kids here who love the game of basketball."" He then credited Chinese former NBA star Yao Ming as a role model. ""That's the most inspiring thing,"" James said. ""Not only was Yao in their backyard, he could also really play the game at a high level so it definitely helps a lot of kids as far as saying 'I can do this and I can do it at a high level.'"" The NBA is one of the most followed sports leagues in China -- its account even has 52 million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social network site. James was joined on court Thursday by teammate and fellow superstar, Dwayne Wade, who has been recovering from off-season knee surgery, but played for several minutes even though it was only an exhibition game. Wade even wore a pair of Li-Ning sneakers, just days after signing an endorsement deal with Chinese sportswear company of the same name. The Beijing-based company is giving the Miami star his own line of shoes. The Heat point guard becomes the biggest NBA name to endorse the Li-Ning brand since his former Miami teammate Shaquille O'Neal. But he's not the only NBA star to endorse Chinese products. Heat forward Shane Battier has endorsed Chinese sneakers brand Peak since 2006. On the playing front, there has long been a well-established connection between the NBA and the China Basketball Association (CBA), the local professional league founded in 1995. Several Chinese players, such as Yao, played in the CBA before moving on to the NBA. In 2011, the NBA and CBA launched a basketball academy to help train more coaches and players. During the NBA lockdown last year, caused by dispute between NBA players and owners, several stars, including JR Smith and Wilson Chandler, played for Chinese teams in the CBA. China has also emerged as alternative destination for former NBA stars in the twilight of their career. Tracy McGrady, 33, has reportedly signed a one-year deal to play this season with CBA side, Qingdao. The former All-Star, who has played with several NBA teams including the Houston Rockets, finished last season with the Atlanta Hawks. His long-time team up with now retired Houston Rockets center Yao made McGrady a popular figure in China. Qingdao has never made it to the CBA finals. His appearance in the CBA is expected to attract more fans to domestic games. ""I am happy for him,"" James said. ""It will be good for the game."" James says he follows the CBA and said the league is ""very good and growing big."" With no Chinese stars currently plying their trade in the NBA, there's a huge opportunity for the country's homegrown stars to show the world what they're missing.","Miami Heat and Los Angeles Clippers in China to play exhibition matches .

The casket was placed atop a hearse, which was festooned with flowers and wreaths and driven slowly toward the military academy. The streets transformed into a sea of green and red, as soldiers and red-clad supporters followed the procession. Venezuela's interim leader thrust into spotlight . Some wept as the casket passed in front of them, while others stretched out their arms to take pictures with their phones. ""Chavez to the pantheon! Chavez to the pantheon!"" the crowd chanted, referring to the country's National Pantheon, which houses the remains of Chavez's hero, South American liberator Simon Bolivar, and other Venezuelan luminaries. The body's arrival at the academy, where it is to lie in state until Friday morning's state funeral, was broadcast live on state television. A number of presidents -- including Uruguay's Jose Mujica, Argentina's Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Bolivia's Evo Morales -- have already arrived in the country for the funeral. The country has declared seven days of mourning, closed schools for the rest of the week and deployed armed forces to ""guarantee peace."" For its part, Venezuela's Interior Ministry sought to guarantee sobriety. It said in a statement that it had banned the sale, distribution and consumption of alcohol through March 12 ""to guarantee the physical integrity of individuals with the intention to maintain internal order and normal development of the country's actions."" The Chavez faithful were most visible Wednesday, but a sizable and strong opposition to the ruling party remains. One 27-year-old man said in a CNN iReport that he fled Venezuela a decade ago because he believed there was no future there under Chavez. ""I left Venezuela because my brother got kidnapped, our house got burglarized, cars stolen,"" Carlos Quijada said. ""My parents had an import business and the currency controls made it impossible for them to import anything anymore."" Quijada said he hoped that things would improve with Chavez's death. ""My life was completely altered because of that man,"" he said. ""And I will not hide the fact that I am happy that he is no longer alive."" U.S. reaction to Chavez's death: from mourning to celebration . A new election will be held within 30 days, possibly signaling a new path for the oil-rich nation. Opposition politicians have not said who will represent them in the election. But as speculation mounted about Chavez's health in recent weeks, many turned to Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in October's presidential contest. On Tuesday, Capriles called for a national dialogue including all Venezuelans, not just Chavez's supporters. ""Today there are thousands, maybe millions, of Venezuelans who are asking themselves what will happen, who feel anxiety, and including those who feel afraid,"" Capriles said. Vice President Nicolas Maduro, the interim president, has made no mention in public of running for election, but he is widely expected to be the United Socialist Party of Venezuela's candidate for the job. During the three months that Chavez was undergoing treatment and absent from the political stage, Maduro has been highly visible. His addresses to political rallies and updates about the president on national television have drawn support from Chavez loyalists. Opinion: Chavez was a maker of dreams . Opposition critics said he was campaigning for office, a claim the government denied. Even as it was announced that Maduro would temporarily assume the presidency, some questioned whether that was constitutional because Chavez missed his inauguration while being treated in Cuba for cancer and was never officially sworn in. ""Diosdado Cabello, a key ally whose biography is similar to Chavez's, would be a stronger bet"" than Maduro to defeat Capriles, said Daniel Greenberg, a professor of history and founder of the Institute of Latin American Service and Studies at Pace University in New York. ""If Capriles wins, Chavez's reforms will most likely be scaled back rather than dismantled. Either way, Venezuela without Chavez will be a vastly different place."" At the United Nations, the Security Council held a minute of silence in Chavez's honor. It was at a U.N. General Assembly meeting in 2006 that Chavez bluntly referred to his U.S. counterpart, former President George W. Bush, who had addressed the world body the day before from the same lectern, as ""the devil."" ""The devil came here yesterday,"" Chavez said. ""And it smells of sulfur still today.""

"Beijing (CNN) -- When the Olympic torch lights up in London on Friday, hundreds of millions of TV screens, laptops and mobile phones will likewise be turned on in China. Chinese sports fans are expected to watch the world's best athletes compete for medals and fame at the 2012 Summer Games. Hardly any Chinese expect London to be able to match the spectacular opening ceremony that Beijing choreographed four years ago. London set for Olympic opener . ""They will get the job done but it definitely won't be as good as China did,"" said Ling Ling, who works for CCTV, the national television network. CCTV plans extensive coverage of many events, including live broadcast of events featuring Chinese athletes. ""The Chinese care about the scale of the ceremony,"" said Jiao Xueqing, a 48-year-entrepreneur in Beijing. ""The British care about the spirit of the Olympics."" Competition begins: Best photos . Chinese athletes carry the burden of their huge nation's hopes and expectations. Who among China's superstars can excel and live up to the Olympic motto -- Faster, higher, stronger? I consulted David Yang, a writer at Sports Illustrated China who also serves as editor of the blog site China Sports Review, and we came up with seven athletes worth watching in London. Liu Xiang . The 29-year-old 110-meter hurdler will aim for his second Olympic gold at the London Olympics. Liu's shocking pullout from the Beijing Olympics remains one of the most memorable events of the 2008 Games. The nation watched aghast as Liu limped off the track after a false start by another runner and pulled out of the competition. Liu later publicly apologized to the Chinese media, saying he could ""do nothing but pull out of the race"" because of the recurrence of a foot injury. ""Liu is just coming back from injuries and he proved he can still fly eight years after winning gold in Athens,"" David Yang tells me. ""When I interviewed him last summer, before the World Championships, he seemed really self-confident and had gotten over the Beijing memories."" Sun Yang . Sun Yang, 20, is the lanky world champion who is leading China's 50-member swimming team to London. Sun is China's hope for a gold medal in swimming, just as Liu Xiang was in track and field eight years ago. ""No Chinese man has ever won a swimming gold medal in the Olympics,"" Yang noted. ""Sun broke the 10-year-old record in 1500m freestyle last year."" Li Na . Li Na, 30, is the first Asian player to win a Grand Slam singles (2011 French Open). The tenacious tennis star is idolized by millions of her compatriots, but Li's maverick streak may also be worth watching. Chinese sports officials reportedly asked Li Na to play doubles as well in London, but she balked, saying she has not played doubles in years and would rather focus on her singles event. ""London will be her last Olympics and it'd be interesting to see whether the late-bloomer can give us another surprise,"" Yang said. Lin Dan . Lin Dan, 28, is perhaps the best badminton player in the world. Nicknamed ""Super Dan"" by his fans, Lin is a four-time world champion, five-time All England champion and the reigning Olympic champion. To defend his title, he may have to face again Lee Chong Wei, the Malaysian star who beat him earlier this year. ""To Chinese badminton fans, the Lin-Lee matchup will be the most anticipated event,"" said Yang. Zhang Jike . Zhang Jike, 24, is the reigning table tennis world champion and World Cup winner in singles. Table tennis, or ping pong, no longer enjoys the attention it got 40 years ago, before China opened its door, but it is still widely considered by many in the Chinese media as ""guo qiu,"" or the ""national ball game."" Millions of Chinese play and watch ping pong. Zhang is the latest superstar coming out of China's most competitive sport. ""He has won every major tournament in singles except the Olympics and Zhang's toughest rivals may be one of his teammates,"" Yang said. Ren Cancan . Ren Cancan, 24, is a policewoman and top amateur boxer. Ren is a three-time world boxing champ but she may be better known lately for the controversy about her age. Ren admitted recently that her actual birthdate is April 26,1986, making her 26, and not January 26, 1988, as had been registered with the international boxing association. The age discrepancy is unlikely to bar Ren from the London Olympics but her frank admission again puts a spotlight on cheating by some Chinese coaches and officials accused of tampering the age of athletes just to win titles and medals. ""To take her first Olympic gold, Ren needs to beat Mary Kom, the five-time world champion from India who carries the hopes of another one-billion nation,"" opined Yang. Guo Ailun . Guo Ailun, only 18, is a fast-blooming point guard of the men's basketball team. Although still green and prone to turning over the ball, basketball fans and commentators hail the emergence of stars like Guo. ""He represents a new generation of players that may look less freakish than Yao Ming but could be more entertaining on the court,"" said Yang. The big question... how many medals can China win? Since China is sending a relatively ""small"" team to London -- nearly 400 athletes, compared to 600 in Beijing -- Team China will be hard pressed to match the 51 gold medals and 100 total medals that it hauled four years ago. Team leader Xiao Tian acknowledges the challenge. ""We made a calculation that in the last five Olympics, the host country has a reduction of 32% of gold medals and medals in total won at the next Games,"" Xiao said. ""We don't think we will have the same amount of medals as in Beijing. But the Chinese delegation will do its best."" With no home-court advantage, Yang said, ""I think 32 golds and 95 medals should be more like it."" Given the time difference between London and Beijing, will Chinese sports fans stay up late at night to watch Olympic events? ""I hope to see the great performances by our Chinese athletes,"" said Xu Lin, 24, who works in a real estate company in Shandong. Others say they will surely tune in but only selectively. Tang Sen, a septuagenarian pensioner and a self-described qiu mi (sports fanatics) enthused: ""I will stay up to watch the events I like and the athletes I admire, whether or not they win gold medals."" Taking part, after all, is more important than winning, as another Olympic motto goes.","China will be watching to see how London's Opening ceremony compares with Beijing's .
London Olympics officially opens Friday to a global audience of billions .
Chinese fans will be paying close attention to several top sports stars .
China doesn't expect to match the medal haul from the Beijing Games in 2008 ."
"Beijing (CNN) -- Divining what is going in China's opaque political world is like reading tea leaves: it may be interesting but it's ultimately a futile exercise. The 18th Congress of the 82-million-member Chinese Communist Party, expected to happen in mid-October, will be a landmark event -- it will usher in a new generation of leaders to rule China for the next 10 years. Yet, little is known about what to expect. Some changes are imminent. Hu Jintao, the incumbent president and party general secretary, will step down and be replaced by Xi Jinping, the current vice president. Many members of the 25-member Politburo and the 371-member Central Committee are also expected to be replaced. These are the two policy-making bodies in the party's pyramid organization. Who will compose the post-Hu leadership? Speculation is rife. Who are the next generation of Chinese leaders? As the congress approaches, political maneuvering has increased among various camps, and there have been a few surprises already. Last week, Ling Jihua, head of the party's General Office, which runs the Leninist organization's day-to-day affairs and oversees security of the top leaders, was abruptly ""reassigned"" to the important but less powerful United Front department. Analysts say Ling, 55, may still be chosen for the Politburo, but he is out of the running for the all-important Standing Committee -- the very highest decision-making body made up of a handful of key leaders. Bo Xilai and the politics of Chinese succession . ""This is evidently a loss for Hu Jintao,"" said Bonnie Glaser, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a think tank based in Washington D.C. ""Ling Jihua was a Hu protégé. Who knows if it was related to the car crash?"" In the early morning on March 18, Ling's son, Ling Gu, 23, was said to have smashed a black Ferrari into a concrete-wall on the side of Beijing's Fourth Ring Road while driving at high speed. Disgraced Party chief looms large over China's leadership . Much was made of the incident in the media internationally, but much of this was rumor and speculation that CNN can not substantiate. Reports and discussions about it have been censored from the local media and Internet. Ling Gu may have survived the car crash but it seems to have damaged his father's political career and dented the party's reputation. ""It casts a negative light on corruption among party members and makes the public question the legitimacy of the officials' source of wealth,"" said Joseph Cheng, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong. ""It has tarnished the image of the leadership."" Did the car scandal benefit Xi at the expense of the outgoing Hu? Other analysts actually credit President Hu for the move on Ling. ""The leadership is establishing a rule: your son misbehaves, you pay,"" said Francesco Sisci, a long-time observer of Chinese politics. ""This move must have been approved by Hu and therefore it does not necessarily weaken him."" Ling has been replaced by Li Zhanshu, 62, a provincial party chief who is known to be an ally of Hu and has previous ties with the vice president. Li, analysts say, may have been a compromise choice. According to Cheng, Xi has been smart to avoid clashes with the current leaders. ""What Xi needs to do now is to keep a clean slate and a low profile and figure out how to consolidate his power,"" he explained. ""Everybody knows he is the presumptive new leader, so he only needs to be patient."" Xi also needs to stay above the factional fights. China's leaders are widely seen as divided into two camps: that of retired president Jiang Zemin and that of President Hu. Former president and party chief, Jiang, retains residual influence even in retirement. The 86 year old has a network of allies in the party -- sometimes known as the ""Shanghai faction"" after the former president's time as Party leader in the city -- which he uses to influence policy and personnel decisions. Last summer Jiang was rumored to have died, but he has since made a rare public appearance looking frail but fairly healthy. Some China-watchers believe Jiang's influence has waned, but others say he remains a player. ""He is still influential,"" said Glaser. ""His Shanghai faction remains quite important and his people are in key positions."" Others say Hu's camp, known as the Communist Youth League (CYL) faction, referring to the youth organization that Hu headed for years, will dominate the new leadership. ""The lineup of the Standing Committee and the full Politburo will show that the CYL remains the largest faction,"" said Willy Lam, a China expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""The CYL is especially strong among the next tier of leaders, born in the 1960s, who will take over power in 2022."" Lam said Hu is now in a good position to anoint one of his protégé, Hu Chunhua, as Xi's presumptive successor in 2022 by getting him selected into the next Politburo. The younger Hu, 49, is a provincial party chief who also headed the CYL. The official line is that the transition is now firmly locked in place, but it would not be China, or the Communist Party, if it were as straight-forward and predictable as that. ""My guess is that appointments can be changed up until the very last minute,"" Sisci said. ""It was so ten years ago, it will even more so today.""

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- As a city that sits astride two continents, Istanbul has always been a strategic gateway between the East and West. But an ambitious railway project is pulling the two continents even closer together with the construction of the world's deepest submerged tunnel. The 76-kilometer (47.2-mile) Marmaray Project will include the world's first submerged railway connection between Europe and Asia, ferrying passengers under a 1.4-km (0.9-m) section of the Bosphorus Strait. However, the massive infrastructure overhaul undertaken by Turkey's Ministry of Transportation has not been without problems. The project started in 2004 and has suffered multiple setbacks due to the region's rich heritage, as Turkey's transport minister Binali Yildirim explains. Infographic: Istanbul and the Bosphorus . ""The tunnel is going under a very historical area, [a] historical peninsula where the Ottoman Empire settled ... so every piece of soil is examined by experts, archaeologists."" Yildirim said. At one point during construction, work had to be halted after the discovery of an ancient Byzantine port. ""If [the archaeologists] say you can go, we go. If they stay stop, we stop,"" Yildrim said. All of which has added five years onto the original construction deadline. Watch: Navigating the busy Bosphorus . To complicate matters further, the tunnel -- which passes under one of the busiest waterways in the world -- lies in an active earthquake zone. ""There is a big, huge seismic activity risk so we have seismic joints in the tunnels, especially between the immersed tube tunnel and the bore tunnel,"" says deputy project manager, Mehmet Cilingir. The joints between the tunnels are flexible and will protect the structure from seismic movements, Cilingir says. Despite the setbacks, the project is scheduled for completion next year -- a target that will be met, Yildirim says. ""We are very comfortable that the project is going to be complete by the end of next year. 14 million people are just waiting [for this tunnel to open.""] . When it does, the tunnel is expected to ease the congested road and ferry routes above carrying 75,000 passengers per hour in each direction at peak times. Train drivers, like Mustafa Berker, are already getting to grips with the new trains that will operate on the line. ""It will be a great joy for me if I too can add a bit to this big project,"" says Berker, a driver with almost four decades experience. ""I'm ready for my retirement but if I can see this through, it will be a great pleasure both for me, my children and grandchildren.""","Marmaray tunnel project in Istanbul will be first railway connection between Europe and Asia .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Dumb as a limestone brick: Indiana's misguided bid for tourists . The great idea: Turn a small Midwestern town into a tourist mecca for lovers of limestone block. The great big problem: Limestone block is not as big a draw as you might think. Cost to taxpayers: $700,000 . Despite being the undisputed ""Limestone Capital of the World,"" Bedford, Indiana, always had a hard time figuring out how to parlay its claim to fame into a thriving tourism industry. That is, until Bedford Chamber of Commerce member Merle Edington came up with a brilliant plan. In the late 1970s, Edington proposed that Bedford build a Disney-style theme park. But, instead of cartoon characters, the park's main attraction would be limestone, featuring a 95-foot-high replica of the Great Pyramid of Cheops built out of (you guessed it) local limestone blocks. And, on the off chance that a scale model of one world wonder wouldn't be exciting enough, Edington added plans for an 800-foot-long replica of the Great Wall of China. While the power of limestone over the vacationing public is debatable, Edington convinced the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration to believe in his dream -- to the tune of $700,000. Unfortunately, those funds dried up quickly, thanks to Wisconsin senator William Proxmire (famous for his ""Golden Fleece Awards"" ridiculing government waste), who called attention to the project. The town was left deep in debt, unable to even pay Edington's salary. Today, the abandoned project is little more than a giant rock pile. 2. How to build a canal in four easy centuries: Dividing and conquering in Florida . The great idea: Build a shipping shortcut through the middle of Florida. The great big problem: The plan would effectively turn half the state into an island. Florida is a peninsula. Get used to it. Cost to taxpayers: $120 million, in this century anyway. The Cross-Florida Barge Canal was one of those ideas that refused to go away. First proposed by Spanish settlers in the 1570s, the canal was supposed to cut through the middle of the peninsula to connect the Atlantic Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico, significantly shortening shipping times. However, after Florida came under U.S. control in the early 19th century, Congress surveyed the land and decided that any canal that would turn a huge chunk of the state into an island just wasn't feasible, and the plan was scrapped. Fast forward to the Great Depression. Suddenly, any project that would create 6,000 jobs seemed like a pretty good idea. President Franklin D. Roosevelt allocated emergency funds to the canal, and digging commenced in 1935. A year later, progress stalled due to environmental concerns, then picked back up, then stalled again, and the cycle continued until 1963, when President Kennedy allocated $1 million to the project. Work began after Kennedy's death and continued for seven years, but --yet again --concerns about the canal's environmental impact ground progress to a halt. Finally, in 1991, the canal (by this time a $120 million partial scar across the middle of the state) was officially pronounced dead. The land was converted into a greenway named after Marjorie Harris Carr, the environmentalist who'd led the charge against the canal in the 1960s. 3. The mess with Texas: Superconducting that's less than super . The great idea: Build a miracle machine that can replicate the Big Bang, help treat life-threatening illnesses, and maybe even unfold the mysteries of the universe. The great big problem: You get what you pay for -- and miracle machines cost way, way too much. Cost to taxpayers: Roughly $12 billion -- and the lives of billions of innocent atoms. Few government projects have ever been announced with the level of fanfare reserved for the 1980s Superconducting Super Collider. Housed in a 54-mile underground tunnel beneath Waxahachie, Texas, the Super Collider was designed to accelerate beams of subatomic particles to fantastic speeds and then crash the particles into one another, purportedly generating huge amounts of energy. Advocates believed the machine would be able to simulate the conditions present during the Big Bang, thus allowing scientists to gain new insights into the very nature of matter. But many Super Collider fans made even bolder statements about the machine's capabilities, pointing out that other devices using similar technology had been used to treat cancer and learn more about HIV. As potential uses for the machine grew, however, so did the cost ballooning from an original estimate of less than $5 billion to just under $12 billion. Finally, in the midst of the 1993 budget-cutting boom, Congress pulled the plug on the project, with less than one-third of the tunnel finished. For a while, it was used to store Styrofoam cups, but then it was sold off to private businesses for pennies on the dollar. Although scientists (and the citizens of Waxahachie) still mourn the loss of this major research center, there are several other machines in the world that do basically the same thing on a smaller scale. They're called particle accelerators, and the largest one is a mere 5 miles in diameter. 4. Building a better future, one spokesmodel at a time: Vanna White school hits Italy . The great idea: When creating jobs for the unemployed, cater to the pretty people first. The great big problem: Regional dignity seems to have gone overlooked. Cost to taxpayers: 1 million euros (about $1.2 million U.S.) In 2003, the European Union came up with a novel solution for lowering soaring unemployment levels among young people in Italy's Campania region history's first job-creation program catering solely to the physically attractive. With a grant of 1 million euros, the EU opened First Tel School, a quasi-educational program designed to train students to become TV game show hostesses. The eight-month program, labeled ""bimbo school"" by critics, offered courses on diction, make-up, and other skills necessary to get a job on one of the country's many popular game and variety shows. The school's de facto policy of discriminating against all of Campania's less toothsome residents aside, First Tel also failed to admit enough students to offer any kind of relief to the region's unemployed population (which was estimated to be 50 percent of young people). Fewer than 100 spots were made available to the 1,200 Vanna White wannabes who applied. Worse still, even those who did make the cut received a whopping 2 euros for every class attended, as well as auditions for parts in the shows First Tel produced for Italian television stations. Meanwhile, rejected applicants remained unemployed and got daily, televised reminders of how unappealing they were. 5. Leave it to beavers: Troubles with the Teton Dam . The great idea: Dam the Snake River in Idaho. Sounds easy enough. The great big problem: Holding back the river's 80 billion gallons of water proved more difficult than engineers thought. Cost to taxpayers: $100 million in construction fees and another $2 billion in damage. The planning and design phase of the Teton Dam in southeastern Idaho took nearly three decades; the construction took a little more than four years. The dam's total collapse, however, took exactly one afternoon. Realizing you just wasted some serious tax dollars? Priceless. Built for just under $100 million between 1972 and 1976, the Teton Dam was supposed to provide irrigation, electricity, and (ironically) flood prevention for the thousands of people living in its 305-foot-tall shadow. But as the reservoir reached its full capacity on June 3, 1976, several small leaks began to appear in the dam. Crews were sent to patch the holes, but larger cracks followed, letting through water that eventually engulfed bulldozers and sent workmen fleeing in terror. Then, on June 5, the dam suddenly collapsed, sending more than 80 billion gallons of water rushing out of the reservoir and into the valley below. By the time the water stabilized more than five hours later, 11 people had died and hundreds of thousands of acres of land had been flooded. Despite the estimated $2 billion in damages, officials seriously considered constructing a new dam for several years afterward. Eventually the idea was abandoned, but more recently, the flood site has gotten some good use as the route of the Teton Dam Marathon. E-mail to a friend .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- The Arab Spring toppled regimes in power for decades within only months of each other. The region's youth were hoping that the adage ""out with the old and in with the new"" would translate into more opportunity. But on the streets of the region's most populous city Cairo you hear despair. Here's the view of a young, female college graduate who's been stymied in her search for work and asked to remain anonymous. ""I was not thinking at all about leaving Egypt before the revolution. It is my country and I have to stay here. But now I cannot see anything that is good."" She is not alone. The International Labor Organization(ILO) put youth unemployment at 28.3% in 2012 and says it will not reverse course for the next 5 years. Despite a global economic recovery the ILO projects a rise to 30% by 2018. The Middle East and North Africa region is the unfortunate title holder of having the worst youth unemployment in the world. Deadly protests at the presidential palace in Cairo to finish out 2012, the seizing of the foreign ministry in Tripoli by those who wanted to ban members of the Gaddafi regime to work in government and a murder of an opposition leader in Tunis illustrate that this post Arab Spring journey is fraught with deep potholes. Mohamed ElBaradei, the Egyptian Opposition Leader and Nobel Laureate said the unsettled nature in this post-Arab Spring environment is scaring off investment. ""We need to restore law and order and we need to jump-start the economy and we need to make sure that people are part of cohesive society and all this not there right now."" Despite prolonged negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on a near $5 billion loan, one of the largest mall developers in the region, Dubai based Majid Al Futtaim has stepped back into the country, with its sprawling development, the Mall of Egypt. It also has a deal pending for an Egyptian supermarket chain. But Chief Executive of the group, Iyad Malas, says the youth of the region are paying a heavy price for a lack of action for decades. ""There has been a chronic unemployment issue in our part of the world because of late reforms. But what has happened because of these delayed reforms there is more and more people coming into the labor market, therefore you see higher rates of youth unemployment. It is a time bomb if you like."" At the World Economic Forum in the Dead Sea last week, it was evident that momentum is building, albeit very late, on public private partnerships, micro financing for small businesses and calls for an Arab Stabilization Plan to fund major infrastructure projects. The panel I chaired ""A New Vision for Arab Employment"" presented all those concrete ideas and fielded tough questions from the audience and youth outside the forum who were watching online. They were the most skeptical. In Saudi Arabia, holder of the world's largest proven oil reserves, the youth jobless rate is right near the regional average, despite a half trillion dollar diversification package from King Abdullah. One of his corporate champions picked to drive change is Mohammed Al Mady, Chief Executive of SABIC, the petrochemical and steel manufacturer with $27 billion in annual revenues. ""The intention is very good,"" admits Al Mady, ""The problem is execution."" Al Mady faced some heat when he admitted that he employs only 50 women in his Saudi operations of more than 20,000 workers. Equal rights remain not only a problem for those unemployed, but it also undermines productivity. Then there is the giant problem at the heart of the region that no one seems capable of solving. Syria. Its civil war has led to a flood of refugees -- over a half million in Jordan. This places additional strains on an economy with the youth unemployment just below 30%. There remains an economically divided Middle East. On one side, the oil rich Gulf states like Saudi Arabia pump billions of dollars into diversification; on the other are the oil importers which includes Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan. In his opening remarks this weekend, King Abdullah of Jordan said that ""double action"" was needed to deal with the disgruntled youth and a potential doubling of refugees in his country. The IMF released a report calling the situation complex, with downside risks. ""The risks come from further prolonged political transition which could still hold back that investment, hold back that recovery because the private sector is waiting to see how things settle down,"" said Masood Ahmed, Director of the Middle East & South Asia for the Fund. The IMF is projecting regional growth of just over 3%, which looks decent by global standards but experts say it is about half of what is required to generate enough opportunity for those who are part of this unprecedented youth bulge.","Middle East and North Africa has world's worst youth unemployment rates .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Patrick Swayze, whose good looks and sympathetic performances in films such as ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ghost"" made him a romantic idol to millions, died Monday. He was 57. Patrick Swayze's doctor said in March 2008 that Swayze was suffering from pancreatic cancer. Swayze died of pancreatic cancer, his publicist, Annett Wolf, told CNN. Swayze's doctor, Dr. George Fisher, revealed in early March 2008 that Swayze was suffering from the disease. ""Patrick Swayze passed away peacefully today with family at his side after facing the challenges of his illness for the last 20 months,"" Wolf said in a statement Monday. Most recently, Swayze starred in A&E Network's ""The Beast,"" which debuted in January. He agreed to take the starring role of an undercover FBI agent before his diagnosis.

""If I leave this Earth, I want to leave this Earth just knowing I've tried to give something back and tried to do something worthwhile with myself,"" Swayze told Walters, when asked why he decided to do the show. ""And that keeps me going, that gets me up in the morning. My work ... is my legacy."" ""The Beast"" was canceled in June because of Swayze's illness, after doctors told him the cancer had spread to his liver. ""We are saddened by the loss of one of our generation's greatest talents and a member of the A&E family,"" a statement from the network said. ""Patrick's work on 'The Beast' was an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed and our thoughts are with his wife, Lisa, and his entire family during this difficult time."" Swayze was mostly known for a handful of supporting roles when he broke through with his performance as dance instructor Johnny Castle in 1987's ""Dirty Dancing."" Co-star Jennifer Grey, who played his young lover, Baby Houseman, in the film, described Swayze as ""gorgeous and strong.""  Watch a look back on Swayze's career » . ""Patrick was a rare and beautiful combination of raw masculinity and amazing grace. ... He was a real cowboy with a tender heart. He was fearless and insisted on always doing his own stunts, so it was not surprising to me that the war he waged on his cancer was so courageous and dignified,"" Grey said in a statement Monday. ""When I think of him, I think of being in his arms when we were kids, dancing, practicing the lift in the freezing lake, having a blast doing this tiny little movie we thought no one would ever see. My heart goes out to his wife and childhood sweetheart, Lisa Niemi, to his mom, Patsy, and to the rest of their family."" Three years after ""Dirty Dancing,"" he became an even bigger star with ""Ghost,"" in which he played an investment banker who dies and learns to tap into his unspoken feelings for his partner (Demi Moore). The film won Whoopi Goldberg an Oscar and helped make him People magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive"" in 1991. ""Patrick was a really good man, a funny man and one to whom I owe much that I can't ever repay,"" Goldberg said in a statement. ""I believe in 'Ghost's' message, so he'll always be near.""  Quiz: How well do you know Patrick Swayze? » . Swayze told Entertainment Weekly in 1990 that ""the movies that have had the most powerful effects on my life have been about romantic characters."" He expanded on the effort he put into love scenes for People in 1991. ""It's possibly the scariest thing I do,"" he said, ""doing something so personal and giving people out there the opportunity to see if you're a good kisser or not."" Patrick Wayne Swayze was born on August 18, 1952, in Houston, Texas. His father was an engineering draftsman; his mother was a ballet dancer and later the director of the Houston Ballet Dance Company. She led her son into the dancing world, which wasn't always easy for a Texas male. Indeed, the young Swayze played football, practiced martial arts and was an accomplished diver and track star while growing up, though he was good enough at dance to earn a college scholarship. After an early professional job playing Prince Charming in an early '70s version of ""Disney on Ice,"" Swayze returned to Houston, where he met Lisa Niemi, a student of his mother's. The two were married in 1975 and moved to New York to pursue their careers.  See timeline of Swayze's life » . Swayze seemed set on a dance career: He studied with the prestigious Joffrey Ballet and joined another company, the Eliot Feld Ballet Company. But surgery for an old football injury ended his ballet career and he turned to acting, nabbing the lead role of Danny Zuko in the long-running Broadway production of ""Grease"" in 1978, around the time the movie starring John Travolta was hitting theaters. ""Grease"" earned him some Hollywood attention, and he and Niemi moved West. After a couple of bit parts, including one in a 1981 episode of ""M*A*S*H,"" Swayze picked up the role of Darrel Curtis in Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 film of ""The Outsiders,"" which also included future stars Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise. Swayze was also one of the leads in 1984's ""Red Dawn,"" about teenagers defending their town from a Soviet attack on America. ""Not only did we lose a fine actor today, I lost my older 'Outsiders' brother,"" said actor C. Thomas Howell, who also starred with Swayze in ""Red Dawn"" and ""Grandview, U.S.A."" But it was with ""Dirty Dancing"" that Swayze hit it big. The film about a girl's coming of age at a Catskills resort in the early '60s was intended for a limited release but became one of the decade's biggest sleeper hits and made Swayze and Grey household names. The film gave birth to a catchphrase -- ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner,"" spoken by Swayze's character to Grey's domineering father (Jerry Orbach) -- and eventually led to a follow-up, 2004's ""Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights."" Swayze even sang a Top 10 hit, ""She's Like the Wind,"" on the film's soundtrack. Swayze, known as a down-to-earth, nice-guy actor, was determined not to follow a predictable career path. He followed ""Dirty Dancing"" with ""Road House"" (1989) in which he played a manager at a rough-and-tumble bar (the film was particularly popular on late-night cable). He succeeded ""Ghost"" with ""Point Break"" (1991), about a group of thieves; ""City of Joy"" (1992), in which he played a doctor in a poverty-stricken Indian village; and ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"" (1995), in which he starred as a drag queen. ''I don't want to be Mr. Romantic Leading Man. I don't want to be the Dance Dude. I don't want to be the Action Guy. If I had to do any one of those all my life, it'd drive me crazy,'' he told Entertainment Weekly in the 1990 interview. Swayze's career diminished in the late '90s. He broke both legs in 1997 while making a film, ""Letters From a Killer,"" and went into rehab to overcome an admitted drinking problem. In 2000, he was flying in his own twin-engine plane when the plane depressurized; Swayze landed in a housing development in Arizona. Though some witnesses say he appeared intoxicated, he was later revealed to have been suffering from hypoxia, related to the depressurization and his three-pack-a-day cigarette habit. Swayze re-established his knack for picking sleepers with ""Donnie Darko"" (2001), the dark film about a troubled student that became a sensation on video. Swayze played a creepy motivational speaker and won raves for his performance. Swayze's more recent films included a TV version of ""King Solomon's Mines"" and 2007's ""Christmas in Wonderland."" Though he still had the power to make women's hearts flutter -- 22-year-old Scarlett Johansson, upon receiving Harvard's Hasty Pudding Award in February 2007, said her dream date was ""probably Patrick Swayze, my dream come true"" -- Swayze wasn't too impressed with himself. ""Good-looking people turn me off,"" he once said. ""Myself included.""

"(CNN) -- If body language is a good gauge of political standing, Li Keqiang is looking very much like China's premier-in-waiting. Last Monday, Vice Premier Li delivered the keynote speech at the Boao Forum, a meeting of business and political leaders held yearly in southern Hainan province. Looking relaxed and confident, he ad-libbed briefly, gesticulating with both hands before he read his prepared speech. ""China's reform has entered a crucial juncture"", Li said, stressing that ""reform and innovation"" are the driving force to promote economic and social development. Li said reforms will focus on taxation, finance, prices and income distribution. No big pronouncements, no off-the-cuff remarks, no mistakes. Barring unforeseen political reversals, Li (whose name is pronounced Lee Kuh-cheeyahng) is expected to become the Chinese premier in March next year, succeeding Wen Jiabao. As the current executive vice premier, Li already oversees important portfolios, such macro economic planning, health care, energy and housing. He is already making an impact. Unlike his predecessors, Li's speaks fairly good English. When he visited Hong Kong University last year, he delivered part of his speech in English -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland. Video clips of his speech went viral on social media. Some netizens thought it was ""inappropriate"" that he spoke in English. Others praised him for ""open-mindedness"" and for breaking away from the stoic style of Chinese leaders. How far Li will break away from old conventions, experts say, remains uncertain. Li is considered a carbon copy of President Hu Jintao, his mentor and benefactor, because of similarities in background, priorities and style. The son of a minor county official in Anhui, a poor province where Hu was also born, Li was a teenager when the decade-long Cultural Revolution interrupted his schooling. As an educated youth who need ""reeducation through labor"", he worked on the farm for four years. There, at age 21, he joined the Communist Party. In early 1978, less than two years after Chairman Mao died, he entered Peking University to study law -- a discipline which in earlier years was reviled as ""bourgeois."" Peking University in the late 1970s was a hub of intellectual and political ferment. I saw that up close when I studied there from 1977-81. China then was at the end of the Maoist era and the beginning of Deng Xiaoping's reform. Inside and outside classrooms, students and faculty debated big topics like ""Where to, China?"" ""Like everyone in our generation Li Keqiang was keen for new ideas,"" recalls Yang Baihui, an international politics major. ""He had the social experience from the Cultural Revolution, so he was also pragmatic."" Li collaborated with Yang and another student in translating ""The Due Process of Law,"" a book on constitutional law by the noted British judge Lord Alfred Denning. ""He was smart, intelligent and hard-working,"" recalls Jingzhou Tao, a former law-school classmate and now a partner at Dechert law firm. ""He was already a student leader at that time."" In 1980, Peking University held competitive elections for ""people's representatives"" to the local legislature. Li did not stand for elections -- he happened to have an off-campus internship -- but as chairman of the student federation he spent time with politically active students like Wang Juntao, who campaigned but failed to get a seat. ""He had the typical traits of Peking University students then -- idealistic and independent, at times very out-spoken about certain issues,"" recalled Wang in a recent essay. After graduation, Li decided to work for the Communist Youth League (CYL), a training ground for party and government officials. ""Since then, we've stepped on different paths and our paths rarely crossed,"" wrote Wang. ""In the 1980s, as the CYL cadre in charge of student movement he handled several incidents, still in the old style like his college days -- control the scale of protests but never resort to political prosecution."" In 1989, however, their paths went in different directions. Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China. Wang was jailed as a ""black hand"" for his role in the student protests that culminated in the bloody Tiananmen crackdown. Wang has been in exile in the United States since 1994 and is now co-chair of the China Democratic Party, which advocates radical change in China. At CYL, Li's career intersected with Hu, who headed CYL for many years. Under Hu's patronage, Li has been on a fast track to the top. In 1998, Li at 43 became Henan's provincial governor, the youngest in China. His brief stint there led to criticisms related to an outbreak of AIDS when the government-run blood banks infected tens of thousands of blood-sellers, some with HIV. Most of the infections actually happened before Li arrived in Henan, but critics accused him of tolerating the cover-up of the scandal. Li also survived three major fire accidents in Henan. In 2004, he was appointed party chief of Liaoning, a rust-belt province in northeast China, and was tasked with reviving its ailing state-owned enterprises. As China's executive vice premier, Li remains a stalwart supporter of Hu's ""seek a harmonious society"" dictum. He advocates social equity and is skeptical of bureaucracy. A confidential U.S, embassy memo published on the WikiLeaks website describes Li telling the then-U.S. ambassador in Beijing that local economic data are ""for reference only."" He acknowledged official corruption as the biggest source of public anger and thought the effective solution was to create transparent rules and adequate supervision. Like his mentor Hu, Li has risen to his high position more by avoiding big mistakes than through bold ideas and major accomplishments. Still, in substance and in style, expectations are high. Chinese microblogger ""Yudafengxue"" tweeted: ""Li is a better speaker than many Chinese top leaders but still needs to work on his stage presentation and body language. It's part of China's national image!""","Li is expected to become Chinese premier next March .

"(CNN) -- There was a plane ticket from Perugia, Italy, to Seattle, Washington, with Amanda Knox's name on it. Her parents bought it in the hope that Knox would be home for Christmas. They bought it as a leap of faith, hoping she would be legally vindicated of the allegation that she killed her roommate Meredith Kercher. They were tired of seeing their daughter's name plastered across newspapers around the world with the word murderer alongside it. But the ticket was never used. In December 2009, that ticket got shredded along with some of the hope her family was clinging to as she was hauled away as a convicted murderer from an Italian court. Now, as closing arguments in Amanda Knox's appeal come to an end, one thing remains the same for the Knox parents: A plane ticket home. They just hope they'll be able to use it this time. A fight to clear Amanda Knox's name . In 2009, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas (they divorced in 1989) boarded a plane to Italy for the verdict in their daughter's murder trial. Hope pumped through their veins: a hope that an Italian court would see that their daughter was not a murderer. They were fighting a legal battle in which the odds were stacked unfairly against their daughter, according to many in Knox's camp. They were also fighting to preserve their daughter's image by countering what they felt was an unfair media caricature of their daughter as ""Foxy Knoxy."" The nickname, her parents said, was given to her in school because of her soccer skills, but during the murder trial it became a nickname to portray her as a careless, sex-crazed party girl. Her family told the story of an entirely different Amanda Knox: one who was ""nonviolent"" and ""almost a passive person."" Amanda Knox: From Seattle to Italy . Prosecutors alleged at trial that on the night of November 1, 2007, at a small house in the college town of Perugia, Knox directed her then-boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and a third defendant Rudy Guede, to hold Kercher down as Knox played with a knife before slashing Kercher's throat. They said the trio left her in a pool of blood and covered her with her own blanket. Knox's parents, like her defense attorneys, said their daughter was not involved in the murder and that evidence presented at trial was thin and clouded by shoddy police work. But at the trial, those arguments fell on deaf ears. Knox was convicted along with Sollecito in the murder of Kercher and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively. Guede was convicted in a separate fast-track trial and is serving 16 years in prison. Now, two years after Knox's conviction, Knox's parents are fighting a similar battle during her appeal. Finding 'the truth' of what happened in Perugia . Inside the same Italian courtroom where Knox and Sollecito were convicted and sentenced, they now fight to try and prove the court got it all wrong. The dispute over forensic evidence has prompted many Knox supporters to question how the Italian court arrived at a conviction. Gallery: A look at the evidence . ""From what we have heard (about) first trials here in Italy, a lot of it is related to emotion,"" Curt Knox told CNN earlier this month. And he, like many in the Knox camp, wonders why more wasn't done to clarify facts about the evidence at trial in order to avoid his daughter being convicted and imprisoned for two years and 24 more to go. ""When you look at the actual forensic evidence (from the murder trial) -- when you take a look at what the police were saying, which is literally 180 degrees different than what the defense was saying about the forensic evidence, and not have an independent review during the first trial, you can see how the result came out as is,"" he said. Disputed evidence at the heart of appeal . Attorneys for Knox and Sollecito, are appealing their convictions together since they were tried and convicted together. Timeline of the Knox case . An independent forensic investigation they fought for at trial could help overturn the convictions in the appeal, the attorneys said. During the murder trial, defense attorneys challenged key DNA evidence found on the alleged murder weapon, a knife, and on Kercher's bra clasp, arguing it had been contaminated after being left for weeks at the crime scene.. They asked for an independent examination of the evidence, but it was denied. During the appeals process the independent examination was allowed and has become the central issue of the appeal. At trial in 2009 prosecutors said there were traces of Knox's genetic material on the knife handle and traces of Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. That DNA was used to tie Knox to the crime scene during the murder trial, though defense attorneys argued there was barely enough DNA to get an accurate reading. During the appeal, one of the independent forensic experts who studied the original evidence told the court that the DNA alleged to be Kercher's that was on the knife could not have been from blood. That key statement has led to a defense argument that there is now truly no official evidence that links Knox to the scene. The next battle in the appeal was to dismiss evidence that prosecutors said ties Sollecito to the murder scene. At trial, the prosecution said a bra clasp found on the bloodied crime scene floor had Sollecito's DNA on it and proved he was in Kercher's room when the murder occurred. Defense attorneys argued the bra clasp had been left on the floor for nearly six weeks before it was collected and was likely contaminated. In the appeal, two independent forensic experts argued Sollecito DNA allegedly found on the bra clasp should be ""inadmissible"" because the clasp had not been properly handled. Prosecutors dismissed the theory again during the appeal, specifying it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene. They said documents showed that proper checks were carried out before and after their DNA tests to verify the quality of the work. But the appeals judge couldn't find the documents in court records and ruled they would not be admissible. The appeals judge denied prosecution efforts to introduce newly found records about the original testing and to hear a new witness -- all victories for Knox's defense, which opposed the motions. Curt Knox said he feels there is ""no case left"" against his daughter. And that's something he said his daughter is clinging to. Will Knox return to prison -- or back home to Seattle? The DNA evidence is the primary subject of closing arguments on both sides of the appeal. Prosecutor Manuela Comodi refuted the testimony from independent forensics experts that cast doubt on the reliability of the evidence, insisting police forensic officers had handled the DNA material properly. She cast doubt on one of the expert who was a professor, rather than a professional in the field and said police had better experience when it came to processing the crime scene than an independent expert. The review had been ""embarrassing, inappropriate, and presented in a hostile way"" and was not based on science, she said. Before asking the jurors to uphold the conviction she told them that the original court had concluded ""beyond any reasonable doubt"" that blood from both Knox and Kercher found in the bathroom sink had been left there when Knox washed herself after the killing. Prosecutor Giuliano Mignini, who investigated the original murder and defended the prosecution's case in the appeal, urged the jurors to make their decision on the basis of what they had heard in court, not in the overwhelming media coverage. But Knox and Sollecito's defense teams are arguing the whole trial was based on DNA evidence ""on which mistakes were made,"" and urged the jury to ""abandon imagined fantasies"" and acquit the pair. Sollecito's defense lawyer Giulia Bongiorno also said during closing arguments to remember that the true evidence points to who they believe is the sole killer: Rudy Guede. Guede, who was convicted earlier of the crime, has admitted being in the villa where Kercher was killed, but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room during his trial. He later implicated Knox and Sollecito. During his trial prosecutors introduced evidence that showed Guede's handprint in Kercher's blood was found in the room along with his DNA inside her body as well as on her clothing and on her purse. ""The room speaks only of Rudy,"" Bongiorno said during closing arguments. Bongiorno also attacked the media portrayal of Knox as a ""femme fatale,"" which he said swayed the outcome of the trial. Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said the court had already seen ""there is not trace of Amanda Knox in the room where murder took place."" He told the jury based on the evidence ""that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving Amanda Knox."" Speculation is rampant as to whether defense attorneys have cast doubt on the evidence that sent Sollecito and Knox to prison for murder. Even the prosecutor's office told CNN that its attorneys are less certain of the outcome this time. The prosecution is still confident that the verdict will be upheld, but is aware that it could go either way, the office said. Curt Knox is more hopeful. ""It really appears to me that they want to find the truth,"" he said during the appeal. ""I'm very hopeful that by the end of the month, we'll be able to bring Amanda and Rafaelle home.""","In 2009, Amanda Knox and her then-boyfriend were convicted of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's hopes of winning a second Wimbledon title were boosted Friday when the world No. 1 was drawn in the opposite half of the field from his three main tennis rivals. The Serbian, who triumphed at the grass-court grand slam in 2011, cannot face defending champion Roger Federer, second-ranked Andy Murray or two-time winner Rafael Nadal before the July 7 men's final. Nadal has been seeded a lowly fifth despite his successful comeback from long-term knee injury, which culminated in a record eighth French Open title this month. He lost in the second round at London's SW19 a year ago, which turned out to be his last match until February. The 27-year-old faces the prospect of renewing his rivalry with Federer in the quarterfinals, and the winner of that match will possibly face Murray. Murray, last year's runner-up, is seeded to play France's world No. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the last eight. Murray will begin his bid to become Britain's first male champion since Fred Perry in 1936 when he takes on Benjamin Becker. He defeated the 32-year-old German -- as well as Tsonga -- on the way to winning the title at Queen's Club on Sunday, having missed the French Open due to injury. Federer, seeded third, will start against Romania's Victor Hanescu in Monday's opening matches as he seeks to win his 18th grand slam title and a record eighth Wimbledon crown. Nadal, on a 22-match winning streak, will play 113th-ranked Belgian Steve Darcis in the first round while Djokovic takes on Germany's Florian Mayer. Djokovic could play world No. 6 Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals ahead of a possible match against Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer -- who could face eighth-ranked Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in the last eight. Ferrer reached his first grand slam final at Roland Garros this month, but had no answer to an in-form Nadal -- who had beaten Djokovic in an epic semi encounter. In the Wimbledon women's draw, defending champion and top seed Serena Williams cannot face Maria Sharapova or Victoria Azarenka until the final. The American, who beat Sharapova in the French Open final, could face a rematch of last year's title match with fourth-ranked Pole Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis. The 31-year-old will first take on Luxembourg's 77th-ranked Mandy Minella, who lost in the first round last year. Radwanska is drawn to meet China's former French Open champion Li Na in the last eight. Sharapova, seeded third after dropping below Azarenka in the rankings, having failed to defend her title at Roland Garros, will start against 20-year-old Kristina Mladenovic of France. The Russian, who won the tournament as a 17-year-old in 2004, is seeded to face Italian No. 5 Sara Errani in the quarterfinals before a possible clash with Azarenka -- who she beat in the Paris semis. Australian Open champion Azarenka, who starts against 112th-ranked Maria Joao Koehler of Portugal, is drawn to play 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova in the last eight.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in opposite half of draw from rest of men's ""Big Four""

"Beijing (CNN) -- For hours, China's micro-blogging community was abuzz with anxious tweets: an important announcement would be released at 6:30 or 7 p.m. on the official China Central Television (CCTV). The news release, sources said, would be about the latest development on Bo Xilai, the popular but controversial official who last month was sacked as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, China's biggest metropolis. The 7 p.m. bulletin passed and there was no news release on Bo. Tune in at 10 p.m., sources advised. 10 p.m. passed and still no news on Bo. Finally, at 11 p.m., China's mainstream official Xinhua new agency announced that Bo had been stripped of his top Communist Party posts for an unspecified ""serious breach of (Communist Party) discipline."" The terse news item identified Bo as ""Comrade Bo Xilai,"" signaling that he has not been expelled from the party, but said Bo is still under intra-party investigation. The other news was just as shocking. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and family aide Zhang Xiaojun have been arrested in connection with the mysterious death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo's wife and Heywood, the Xinhua report said, were on good terms but ""they had conflict over economic interests."" Chinese official's wife arrested in Briton's death . The death of the British businessman, who was found in his hotel room in Chongqing on November 15 last year, has emerged as a key link in an unfolding story of intrigue and suspicion. Heywood's death was originally blamed on alcohol poisoning or heart attack, but the case was reopened after reports of possible foul play emerged. The British government sought a new investigation. Asked if there were updates on the re-investigation of Heywood's death, foreign ministry spokesman Liu Weimin replied: ""As regards the case of death of the British national Neil Heywood, the relevant information has been publicized and the case has entered the legal process. The justice department will handle it according to law."" Liu said a Chinese foreign ministry official Tuesday night separately briefed officials of the British and U.S. embassies in Beijing. The April 10 announcement may mark the end of Bo's political career, experts say, but not the end of the biggest political crisis to hit the Communist Party in more than two decades. Bo's dismissal has triggered political in-fighting in the Communist Party ahead of the once-in-a decade political transition in autumn this year. China's leaders are keen to project an image of unity and harmony in the leadership. So why the delay in official reports? Hours before the news release Tuesday, Chinese sources say, Communist Party officials, from the top tiers of leadership down, were told of the impending news in closed-door briefings. ""Officials decided to tell more people in the grassroots and that process took longer,"" says a Chinese source. ""The announcement is meant to curb rumors and speculations."" Bo's problems began when he fell out with Chongqing police chief, Wang Lijun, who sought refuge briefly in the U.S. consulate in Chengdu in February. In a commentary published Wednesday, official newspaper The Global Times wrote: ""The past two months, there have been a lot of various rumors, but if we look at the whole process, the handling of the unexpected case of Wang Lijun shows that China has strong predictability. It cannot be easily disrupted by some accident or uncertainty."" Still, the commentary cannot hide the sense of anxiety among officials in charge of news in the mainstream media. Hours before the news on Bo was read by CCTV announcers, producers at the network received by mobile text messaging an urgent notice: ""All producers and section chiefs must inform all staff, including freelancers, before 10 p.m. tonight: no one should use weibo and other Internet tools to forward any untruthful statements. Whether or not they were sent by real-name or anonymous bloggers. This is about news discipline! Please strictly and seriously abide.""","Bo Xilai stripped of Communist Party posts for unspecified ""serious breach of (Communist Party) discipline""

"Beijing (CNN) -- On a typical day, China's border with Myanmar is quite porous and vibrant. Often from the same ethnic groups, traders from both sides share much in common and do brisk business. I saw that up close during a reporting trip for CNN a few years ago. At one border town in China's Yunnan Province, I saw residents from both sides, speaking similar dialects, buying and selling produce, consumer goods, minerals and timber, before crossing back to their own country. We even brought back Myanmar bank notes as a souvenir from the trip. Scenes like this along the two countries' 2,000-kilometer border serve as constant reminders of long and deep bilateral ties. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was one of the first countries to recognize China's Communist government in 1949. Over the years, after the 1962 coup d'Ã©tat in Myanmar, most Western governments shunned the Southeast Asian nation because of its poor human rights record. China and the ruling junta grew closer, however, with Beijing becoming the country's most influential supporter on the world stage. ""The Myanmar government really was thrown an economic, military and political lifeline by the Chinese, particularly in the last 20 years in light of Western sanctions,"" says Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Northeast Asia director of the International Crisis Group, an independent think tank. ""There is a very strong continuing political and economic relationship."" By the end of 2010, China had become Myanmar's second-largest trading partner. China is also the biggest foreign investor there, with Chinese companies building highways, pipelines and other major projects. For its part, Myanmar offers China energy resources and a strategic gateway to the Indian Ocean. Chinese access in and through Myanmar will lessen China's dependence on the Malacca Straits, a long and congested sea lane through which an estimated 80% of Chinese imported energy supplies pass. ""Close to the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, Myanmar is important for China to develop its southwestern provinces, which have a population of 200 million people,"" writes Li Xiguang, a professor with Tsinghua University in Beijing, in his column in the state-run Global Times newspaper. Just days before U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's historic visit to Myanmar, amid signs of what Washington considers positive changes in the country under a new government, China's vice president Xi Jinping told Myanmar's top general in Beijing the two countries should strengthen military ties. But not all has gone smoothly in China-Myanmar relations. In September, Myanmar unexpectedly suspended the construction of the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower station financed by a Chinese company, citing environmental and social concerns. The project was meant to provide much-needed power to China but it would have displaced thousands of local residents. ""The Myanmar people are very upset about particularly resource-extraction activities, where the Chinese are not consulting the communities, they are not providing benefits to the communities, they displace populations and they engage in environmental degradation,"" says Kleine-Ahlbrandt, the International Crisis Group analyst. The decision was seen as a rare concession by the government to public pressure -- and a blow to China. ""This incident made some believe that Myanmar is showing goodwill to the West at the expense of Chinese interest,"" an editorial on the Global Times this week reads. Other observers say Myanmar's decision on the dam project was largely driven by internal factors. ""It's a strong indication that the government is ready to say 'no' to Beijing when it is in its interest to do so,"" says Suzanne DiMaggio of the New York-based Asia Society. Clinton's visit is ""an opportunity for the U.S. to help move Myanmar away from authoritarian rule and into the world community,"" she adds. ""The visit also sends a strong signal to China that the U.S. is seeking to contain Beijing's influence in Myanmar."" Some Chinese political observers are picking up that signal too. Clinton's visit ""will further unnerve China, which has recently been increasingly worried that the aim of the United States' new Asia policy is to isolate and encircle China,"" writes Li, the Tsinghua University professor. Publicly, at least, Beijing's diplomats maintain China is not worried about Myanmar's engagement with the U.S. ""China welcomes Myanmar and Western countries to improve their relations on the basis of mutual respect,"" says Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei. ""We hope Myanmar's move will be conducive to the country's stability and development."" Beijing also appears more proactive in engaging the Myanmar people, especially after the controversial decision on the dam. It recently sent a rare Buddhist relic to Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, to be on public display. ""It's part of this new outreach -- using religion, using media, using non-governmental organizations,"" observes Kleine-Ahlbrandt of the International Crisis Group. ""China is trying to learn about how it can exert soft power."" Even as Myanmar's leadership begins to mend fences with Washington, few expect to see China and Myanmar drift too far apart, thanks to the two neighbors' inter-dependent relationship. ""Myanmar continually depends on China's investment, on Chinese trade and Chinese political cover in the international community,"" says Kleine-Ahlbrandt. ""China depends on Myanmar for access to its resources and also for the border to remain peaceful.""","Myanmar was one of the first countries to recognize China's Communist government in 1949 .

"(CNN) -- After a nearly decade-long effort, the National Congress of Black Women on Tuesday honored Sojourner Truth by making her the first African-American woman to have a memorial bust in the U.S. Capitol. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and first lady Michelle Obama applaud the unveiling of the Sojourner Truth bust. Truth, whose given name was Isabella Baumfree, was a slave who became one of the most respected abolitionists and women's rights activists. ""One could only imagine what Sojourner Truth, an outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is kind of woman ... what she would have to say about this incredible gathering,"" first lady Michelle Obama said at the Celebration of Truth ceremony. ""We are all here because, as my husband says time and time again, we stand on the shoulders of giants like Sojourner Truth."" ""And just as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott would be pleased to know that we have a woman serving as the speaker of the House of Representatives, I hope that Sojourner Truth would be proud to see me, a descendant of slaves, serving as the first lady of the United States of America,"" she said. Dignitaries and congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, House Republican Leader John Boehner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, attended the ceremony marking the unveiling of the statue. Along with musical performances, actress Cicely Tyson recited ""Ain't I A Woman,"" Truth's famous 1851 speech to a women's rights convention. Clinton and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, who worked together to draft legislation to commission the bust, were among speakers who paid tribute to the late C. Delores Tucker, former chairwoman of the NCBW, who spearheaded the effort for the Truth memorial. ""What a wonderful day it is to be here in Emancipation Hall for this great occasion when Sojourner Truth takes her rightful place alongside the heroes who have helped to shape our nation's history,"" Clinton said. ""Today, she takes her place in this Capitol, and we are the better for it,"" Clinton said. ""She is a sojourner of truth, by truth, and for truth. And her words, her example and her legacy will never perish from this earth, so long as men and women stand up and say loudly and clearly, 'We hear you echoing down through the years of history. We believe that your journey is not yet over, and we will make the rest of that journey with you.' "" The bronze statue, which was crafted by Los Angeles, California, sculptor Artis Lane, will stand in Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. ""All the visitors in the U.S. Capitol will hear the story of brave women who endured the greatest of humanity's indignities. They'll hear the story of Sojourner Truth, who didn't allow those indignities to destroy her spirit, who fought for her own freedom and then used her powers ... to help others,"" Michelle Obama said. ""The power of this bust will not just be in the metal that delineates Sojourner Truth's face; it will also be in the message that defines her legacy. Forevermore, in the halls of one of our country's greatest monuments of liberty and equality, justice and freedom, Sojourner Truth's story will be told again and again and again and again."" In 1997, Congress passed a special act that called for relocating the Portrait Monument from the Capitol basement to the rotunda. The 7.5-ton statue depicts three leaders of the suffragette movement -- Anthony, Stanton and Mott. A group called the Sojourner Truth Crusade was upset about the statue's relocation because it didn't incorporate Truth. After Congress agreed to go ahead with a move, advocates proposed commissioning a new statue that would include Truth. In 2006, Congress passed a bill to honor the abolitionist with her own memorial.","Sojourner Truth was an abolitionist and women's rights activist .

"(CNN) -- ""My body belongs to me and is not the source of anyone's honor."" The words of Tunisian activist Amina Ahmed, scrawled across her naked chest in Arabic and posted on Femen's Facebook page are true, and right. Women should have the choice to dress how they want, when they want, without fear of reprisal and safe from harm. As too many women in all corners of the can attest, this is not the reality. From war to politics to art, shock tactics can be useful, powerful tools. They force the opposed to take notice, to hopefully retreat, to surrender their advantage. In the arena of human and women's rights, they are a staple -- from the burning of draft cards during the anti-Vietnam war protests of the 1960s to bra burning (myth or no) to Mohamed Bouazizi, the street vendor who set himself on fire and inadvertently roused the Tunisian Revolution -- shock tactics can, and do work. They work across cultures too: I first learned of the Women's War which took place in eastern Nigeria in 1929 (an anti-taxation and anti-colonialist protest which ended with reports of up to 100 Igbo casualties), when I was at school in Lagos. I learned that some of these women stripped naked to make their case -- an admirably thought out and executed case of naked protest, in a non-Western culture, from more than 80 years ago. It was effective, too-- administrative reforms were carried out, bringing an end to the Warrant Chief system (introduced by British colonialists) and women were appointed in local courts. So my issue with Femen, and any other such organizations, is less to do with the mode of protest, and more the gaze and rhetoric behind it. Femen purports to know, in an almost patriarchal way, what is ""best"" for these poor, oppressed women in Africa and the Middle East. Their problem is religion, and their naked protest is there to ""help"" free them from the ""tyranny"" therein. Yes -- there are huge chasms between the rights of men and women all over the world, and perhaps more visibly in these communities. But there are also women (and men) in those communities working to remedy this, using different tools, (some more blunt than others) and in all likelihood just as effective or even I would argue, more so, than Femen's methods. Read more: Why topless protesters will hound Islamic leaders . I am Nigerian-British and a Muslim, now living in the geographical West. I know that my experiences do not match that of a woman my age in a small town in Mali, or Pakistan. I don't wear a hijab; never have done, unlikely ever to. I don't care one way or another about the hijab, but I do care about choice. In electing not to wear a headscarf, I have exercised that right, and not all of the women who wear scarves have the luxury of that choice. But there are also millions of women who choose, very happily and deliberately, to wear the hijab. Is it ""liberating"" to ban the hijab for these women? Femen's intent may be honorable, but the implementation seems wrong-headed to me. A lot of us in brown and black bodies have become used to the neo-colonial lens through which the rest of the world views us. We are there to be ""helped"", to be ""liberated"". There exists a powerful and deliberate narrative around Africa and the Middle East: ""we must go there and free them!"" If you are only viewing people as hapless, helpless children -- which is how I see a lot of Femen's rhetoric as applied to Africa and the Middle East -- you rob them of agency. It is not up to Femen to go and ""free"" these women. We cannot export tactics that simply don't work, in the name of sisterhood. Read more: Topless feminist protesters show what they're made of . What kind of sisterhood insists that an attitude of ""this works here and will therefore work over there"" is the way forward? Is there no nuance to be found, if the objective is to free women of the patriarchy that governs their lives? It is naive and somewhat foolish at best, and at worst dangerous and stupid. It is looking at a health problem and deciding that their prescription is the only drug that will clear up the rash, when locally sourced medicines may work just as well, if not better. At the very least, work with organizations already at the coalface day after day, collaborate with and listen to them. If the aim is genuinely to make a fairer society, not to merely impose benevolent condescension, it's a necessary step. The Femen message, with a core belief in self-determination and equality, unshackled from damaging patriarchy, is good and true. But their methods leave much to be desired. The opinions expressed in this commentary are soley those of Bim Adewunmi.","Femen activists have used topless protest in a campaign against patriarchy .

"(CNN) -- Drug kingpin Benjamin Arellano Felix, one of the leaders of the major Tijuana cartel, was extradited to the United States on Friday, Mexico's attorney general's office said. Arellano Felix was one of seven brothers who ran the cartel until he and the majority of the leadership was arrested. The Tijuana cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, was weakened as a result, but is still considered one of Mexico's major drug trafficking operations. He had been convicted of organized crime activities in Mexico and was serving several sentences in prison. He is wanted in the United States on two indictments for conspiracy, money laundering, drug trafficking, operating a drug smuggling organization, and murder. The Tijuana cartel, during its peak in the 1990s and early 2000s, controlled the flow of cocaine, marijuana and other drugs into the United States through Tijuana and Mexicali, the Mexican attorney general's office said. One of the strategies that Mexican President Felipe Calderon has employed in his fight against the drug cartels has been sending traffickers to face justice in the United States. In Mexico, even convicted traffickers have been known to communicate freely and control their organizations from inside prison. Being tried in the United States is thought to be a deterrent. In addition to trafficking drugs, the cartel under Arellano Felix's leadership ran a network of bribes, spies and killings, the attorney general's office said. He was considered the brains and accountant for the organization, the agency said. Arellano Felix was arrested in 2002 in the city of Puebla. Extradition processes against him began in 2007. The handover to U.S. marshals happened Friday at a hangar at the international airport in the city of Toluca, Mexico.","Benjamin Arellano Felix is wanted in the United States .

"(CNN) -- For some, this week in Europe will be consumed by a singing contest. Eurovision. A contest where musical ambassadors from all over Europe and beyond come together as an instrument for political jockeying... I mean to showcase their talent in a performance of free expression. In either case, it makes this year's venue --Azerbaijan -- a controversial one, but also an excellent opportunity for international advocacy to do some good. Eurovision is a singing contest whereby each country participant, which includes most countries in Europe and others who are members of the Eurovision Broadcasting Union, like Russia and Israel, sends musical acts to a competition that pits country against country. It should be about the performances. But, it isn't. It's European politics at its most flamboyant. And this show has been a curious reflection of regional politics since 1956. Historically, Eurovision has offered some interesting outlets for citizen voters. Britain received no votes in 2003 after joining the U.S. in invading Iraq. On the other hand, the contest provided for a coalition with encouraging indications in 2007 when Serbia won after it nabbed the support of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Slovenia. This year's contest is in Azerbaijan, which is a member of the Eurovision Zone. The venue is a contested one, both when it comes to the country and the actual site for the competition itself. Claims of corruption and political repression plague the Baku government led by President Ilham Aliyev. The Aliyev government is especially infamous for corruption, and Transparency International rates it as one of the most corrupt governments in the world. The Aliyev family is reported to have interests in just about every private sector (which does not include oil and gas in the public sector), including telecoms, construction, real estate, aviation, and mineral mines. Few were surprised to learn recently that the president is profiting off the Eurovision contest. It was recently uncovered by the Organized Crime and Reporting Project in conjunction with Radio Free Europe that his family appears to have a stake in the company actually constructing the venue. Azerbaijan won the honor of hosting this year's contest in Baku because its singing duo, Eldar & Nigar won with their song, ""Running Scared"" in 2011. Coincidentally, plenty of people in Azerbaijan are in fact scared. And this reality flies in the face of the polished pro-Western exterior the government transmits to the world. The, actually very, autocratic government cracks down on any dissent. Some reports indicate that the Azerbaijan government is imprisoning 17 ""prisoners of conscience""; others say it is more like 70. These are individuals imprisoned not for a crime but as punishment for their exercise of a fundamental freedom, most often freedom of expression. On World Press Day earlier this month, Azerbaijan's Ambassador to the United Nations, and current Security Council President, Agshin Mehdiyev told a room of journalists that Azerbaijan has a ""free media"" and ""does not need world press day."" People inAzerbaijan tell a different story. And embarrassingly, the ambassador was clearly unaware of the occasion. The month before, an Azerbaijani journalist, Eynulla Fatullayev, had been awarded UNESCO's World Press Freedom Prize. Eynulla Fatullayev had been unjustly imprisoned in 2007 and released in 2011. In another attempt to cut off criticism, the Azerbaijan government imprisoned two well known bloggers, Emin Milli and Adnan Hajizade, in 2008. The bloggers' crimes: hooliganism. Their real crime: a video poking fun at the government's recent extravagant payment for donkeys. The two men -- now known as the donkey bloggers -- were released early, after a coordinated international campaign. Today among these prisoners of conscience is Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, a former student of the Harvard University Kennedy School of Public Policy. After the program, Bakhtiyar went home to Azerbaijan to stand in a parliamentary election. He used his campaign platform to call for an end to government corruption. The government did not appreciate this, and began hassling him about compulsory military service. The Council of Europe, of which Azerbaijan is a member, has called repeatedly for alternative civil service to be permitted. The government added constitutional language to provide for alternative service, but in practice does not permit alternative service. Despite legal deferments and a plea for alternative civil service, Bakhtiyar was sentenced to two years in prison -- the longest prison term observed for this crime. With the Azerbaijan government in violation of the Council of Europe, infamous for corruption, notorious for repression against expression, it is indeed ironic that Europe's most beloved singing contest is held in Azerbaijan. Certainly, the Azerbaijani people are proud of this attention. And they should be. But, this is not just an opportunity for the Azerbaijani people to shine, Eurovision is also an important opportunity for us all to focus on the host country's government and to demand reform, which to start should be the release of individuals like Bakhtiyar Hajiyev. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maran Turner .","Maran Turner says Eurovision is an opportunity for international advocacy to do good .

"(CNN) -- While the likes of Roger Federer and Serena Williams strut their stuff at Wimbledon, spare a thought for the grass under their feet -- which will take a double pounding in the next two months. Just 20 days after the men's final at the All England Club, the tennis competition at the 2012 London Olympics will begin -- and the team working on the famous courts are keeping their fingers crossed that this week's inclement weather does not cause any further delays. Andy Newell from the Sports Turf Research Institute (STRI) gives Wimbledon head groundsman Eddie Seaward and his staff expert scientific advice on that preparation and admits that any delay into a third week would be a serious problem. ""They don't want to lose time because they are already on such a fine edge and even a day would mean you lose 5% of your preparation, and that could be crucial,"" he told CNN. Ten of Wimbledon's courts will be used for the Olympics and it's going to prove Seaward's biggest challenge -- coming in his final year in the job, after more than two decades of involvement. Preparation is the key, and the London Olympic Organizing Committee (LOCOG) insisted on a trial run at Wimbledon after the Games were awarded to the UK capital. Trial run . ""We worked on them just a couple of years ago to prove to LOCOG that we could do that within a short period of time, get the courts back in pristine condition,"" Seaward told CNN. But trial run or not, it's still a daunting prospect with little room for error. The grass must be cut to an exact 8 millimeters for optimum performance, and Seaward and his team have to keep a wary eye on that unpredictable British weather -- ground temperature and humidity levels are constantly measured. For this reason, the expertise of scientists and agronomists is so important. STRI has been advising Wimbledon for over a decade. At its main testing center in a little corner of West Yorkshire, in northern England, its staff have recreated their own versions of Centre Court -- trialing different varieties of grass to provide the best and most resilient surface. ""We can test the grasses that they may use in the future here, "" said Newell, STRI's head of turf grass biology. ""We can whittle them down, we can get rid of the chaff, hopefully keep the wheat for them."" Best grass . Over the years, Newell and his colleagues have come to the conclusion that perennial ryegrass provides the best surface, both in terms of wear and playing characteristics. ""In essence we've moved from one grass species which was inappropriate for Wimbledon, to one which was the best for Wimbledon,"" says STRI chief executive Gordon McKillop. The company has grown to employ up to 85 people, and Wimbledon forms just part of their work. The cricket pitches at Lord's, the fairways and greens of St. Andrews, the home of golf, and the football turf for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine have all had their grass tried and tested at STRI's research center in Bingley. When the pitch at the Euro 2012 game between France and the Ukraine dramatically flooded, experts from STRI were on hand to monitor its drying out. They had advised using a vacuum pump system when the Donbass Arena in Donetsk was constructed, and it paid off. Weather gods . The team working on Wimbledon and the Olympics had been keeping their fingers crossed for the perfect growing conditions at SW19 in July and August. ""Two weeks of wall-to-wall sunshine, not unbearably hot, with the odd contrast in conditions, perhaps a bit of rain, would make our job much easier,"" said Newell. But true to form the British weather has misbehaved during the championships and the inevitable rain delays have left organizers with more than a few headaches. For Newell the effect of such a varied climate on growing conditions is the bread and butter of his work. He has installed micro weather stations at Wimbledon to aid his research, as well as digging a small hole on Centre Court to measure moisture levels. ""It's quite an important hole because it allows me to measure how much moisture there is at different depths,"" Newell said. ""Moisture is needed for the grass to grow, but it's also needed in the sense that we've got to dry it out to get the ball to bounce."" Surprise tactic . The playing characteristics of the courts at Wimbledon have been the subject of debate and no little controversy over the years, with claims it now favors baseline play rather than classic serve and volley. Newell said the trend was more to do with the strength of the players, their rackets and the balls that are being used, rather than the surfaces being prepared. ""Players now use serve and volley as a surprise tactic rather than the norm,"" he said. During Seaward's time at the All England Club, he has seen that change of tactics reflected on the worn parts of his courts. ""When I first started here, the players used to serve and run in to return the ball, they used to check and stop and wear the grass out and there's a patch in the middle there. That slowly but surely moved further back every year, until it's completely disappeared,"" he said. Without the likes of Boris Becker and Pete Sampras charging forward to scuff up the grass in the middle of the court, the task of the groundsman has become rather easier, particularly with the tight Olympic deadline in mind. Seaward and his team will begin their Olympic work even while play is still taking place on the show courts. ""We know the baseline is more worn than the rest of it, but by the time you get a bit of water on it, it starts to green up a bit,"" he said. Nature's way . The secret is using pre-germinated, or pre-grown seed, which is sowed into the worn patches. ""We've got to try to get some grass back in there, in a very short space of time,"" Seaward said. ""Within a few days it will be up, hopefully, and we'll be preparing the courts."" And bearing this in mind, there is a plus side to the constant drizzle that is coming out of the cloudy skies of London in what has proved a pretty miserable summer. ""For growing grass, rain is a bonus,"" said Newell, adding that water from the sky falls more evenly than that supplied by artificial sprinklers. Newell believes that the soil texture underneath the grass is just as important in determining the playing characteristics, but knows that when hosting the biggest sports show on earth, aesthetics are important. ""The idea is that we get the court to look the way it's going to look on the opening Monday of Wimbledon."" But he warned: ""It all comes back to nature, and nature can't be rushed."" If the joint efforts of all those involved are ultimately successful, perhaps the International Olympic Committee could award a special gold medal to Seaward and his extended team -- because working around the clock, they may well have deserved it.","Wimbledon is also hosting the 2012 Olympic Games tennis tournament .

"(CNN) -- ""These are the explosive devices, they are all made locally,"" Captain Daoud Hassan Mahmoud explains, crouching down and pointing to the metal cylinders, perhaps just 20cm in diameter -- dozens of them are lined up next to each other. The cylinders are packed with a deadly concoction of fertilizer, explosives and other chemicals bought from the local market. ""I don't want to name them so that the government doesn't confiscate them from the shops,"" Mahmoud says. Placed on the top of the cylinder thick nuts and bolts -- which will turn into lethal shards of shrapnel once detonated: Crude, but highly effective. ""This one would blow up a jeep or a pick-up,"" he says, pointing to two of the cylinders which a rebel is roughly taping together, in the final stages of preparation. ""For a tank or an armored vehicle we use six or eight."" Outgunned by Assad's forces, the captain's team -- the Daoud brigade -- is resorting to Iraq-style guerilla warfare, turning to roadside bombs and, in at least one case, a suicide bombing. Escalating violence limits U.N. observer mission in Syria, official says . Clips said to be of the brigade's operations are often posted to YouTube, starting off with a Quranic verse, followed by stylized graphics of the brigade's name, and its division -- the Damascus Hawks. Hardly audible below the music -- a jihadi chorus meant to motivate -- a voice narrates each attack. The videos are all very similar in tone to those that came out of Iraq when al-Qaeda-allied insurgents there took on the US military. In that battlefield the IED proved to be the most effective weapons against American armor. In Syria today it is also becoming the weapon of choice. Mahmoud says they have received no outside help. ""Our funding is dependent on donations, a small collection of money. And what we're able to capture from the Syrian military. We have not received any help even from the Free Syrian Army leadership or the Syrian National Council,"" he claims. And so, he says, they have had to improvise. Is Syria in a civil war? ""We only have AK 47s, sniper rifles, machine guns,"" Mahmoud explains. ""And the regime is fighting us with tanks and rockets. We don't have heavy weapons. We're relying on mines and on making bombs."" Mahmoud says he commands 300 men. The Damascus Hawks Division is made up of around 8,000, operating mostly in Idlib province. There is no way of confirming such claims. The division, he says, was first made up of defectors and civilians and has gradually increased in numbers. He says his men are moderate Islamists, who follow the military council of the Free Syrian Army, fighting for democracy. ""As military men, we don't want to see one in power,"" he says. ""We want a democratically elected president, we have to separate the military from the presidency. ""We are also fighting corruption and those opportunists that are in the Idlib countryside,"" he continues, referring to people he says are capitalizing on the uprising to wreak havoc and carry out operations in the name of the opposition. The men look relaxed as they calmly mill around among the olive groves, AK 47s slung over their shoulders. This is territory they control. They are a ragtag collection of rebel fighters but in this part of Idlib province in Syria, they boast of taking the fight to the Syrian regime. Just back from a mission, one of the fighters explains that it failed. ""We set up an ambush against Assad's army using IEDs but they received intelligence about our plan and rerouted the convoy."" Another claims his unit was successful. ""We destroyed an armored vehicle,"" he boasts. This is now the Syrian battlefield.

"(CNN) -- Reputed former mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger did not have the right to commit more murders after striking a purported immunity deal with the FBI in the 1970s, a federal judge ruled Monday, knocking down a key part of Bulger's defense at his trial. Bulger, the alleged former head of Boston's notorious Winter Hill gang, faces 19 murder charges, as well as charges including extortion, money-laundering and narcotics distribution. The defense had initially moved to dismiss the case, saying Bulger was granted immunity by federal agents working to infiltrate Irish and Italian mobs in Boston three decades ago. Judge Richard Stearns denied Bulger had ""prospective immunity"" -- that is, immunity to commit crimes made after his purported deal with the FBI. Stearns left undecided whether Bulger had ""historical immunity"" for crimes committed before a deal. He gave both sides time to review evidence on that point. Bulger's attorneys had also sought to have a jury decide on his immunity claim, arguing he would receive a fairer hearing, but Stearns refused. Photos: Whitey Bulger in hiding . Bulger's attorneys said he is prepared to detail the immunity deal ""for past and ongoing crimes"" at trial, and they said they will continue to fight for a jury trial. ""The federal government has done everything in its power over the past 25 years to cover up the relationship between James Bulger and federal law enforcement authorities,"" the attorneys wrote in a statement after the ruling. ""The federal government, including attorneys who worked for the (U.S. Justice Department) during this period, desperately want to conceal this sordid history from the jury, the victims, and the public. Today's decision is another step toward that goal."" The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment. Regarding Bulger's claim of immunity, Stearns wrote that a license to kill is ""beyond the pale and one unknown even in the earliest formalities of the common law."" He wrote the defense has provided a ""paucity of information"" about the deal that Bulger says he struck with Jeremiah O'Sullivan, then the head of the Justice Department's New England Organized Crime Strike Force. Prosecutors submitted an affidavit from a former U.S. Justice Department official who says that if O'Sullivan did grant Bulger immunity from his past crimes, then it was without proper approval and against agency practice. The affidavit is part of the evidence the two sides will be reviewing on historical immunity. Bulger made headlines when he was arrested in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California, after being on the run for 16 years.

"(CNN) -- Recently, a puzzling website appeared that seemed to be from the Shell Oil Company. Using Shell's logo and its website's design, the page contained information about Shell's oil drilling activities in the Arctic. It included a function where viewers could caption pictures said to be taken by Shell Oil in the north (a dangerous feature for Shell -- just imagine the captions people would generate under a picture of a baby Arctic fox on an oil company website). Soon after, a video appeared on YouTube that seemed to show an event sponsored by Shell that went badly awry. A small fountain, in the shape of an oil rig, starts spraying guests and some of the pseudo-environmental decorations of the Alaskan frontier with simulated oil. Finally, in the video, what seemed to be a poorly designed media response by Shell Oil made everything worse. As you may have guessed (if you have not already heard), the entire thing -- website, video and even Shell's response -- was a hoax created by Greenpeace and the Yes Men, a group of online activists that targets corporations. Shell has wisely decided to remain low-key about the whole thing, issuing a press release that clarifies its lack of involvement but otherwise just hoping the whole concocted ensemble would go away. Is Greenpeace's prank on Shell oil a 'scam'? Welcome to the golden age of culture jamming. Coined in 1984, culture jamming is a tactic of subverting the media as a form of protest. But the advent of social media has taken it to a whole new level. In the old days, culture jamming might mean defacing a billboard, handing out forged fliers, or staging a false corporate or political event and hoping the media would cover it as if it was real. But today, a fake video or website can quickly go viral and be spread through tens of thousands of shares, tweets, repostings and imitations. It is almost impossible to put that genie back in the bottle. Social media is emerging as a powerful tool, and neither law nor social consensus has yet caught up with it. On the one hand, it allows a remarkable amount of influence to be wielded by those who traditionally had little. Social media ends the communication dominance of the big players like the mass media and large corporations; it is the great equalizer. From the privacy of one's computer, virtually the entire world can be one's audience. On the other hand, because it is both relatively cheap and can be so potent, social media is ripe for abuse, whether through scams, gossip, or misrepresentations. As a medium of protest, the tool is a mixed blessing. Certainly, social media provides some balance in the information battle with corporations who have multimillion-dollar public relations and advertising programs. But the line between legitimate protest through culture jamming and libelous misrepresentation or trademark infringement is muddy. While the legal issues may be contentious, the ethical boundaries seem clearer. Opinion: Why we should look to the Arctic . Many sympathize with the intent of the Greenpeace-Yes Men protest. Yet, as much as one might disagree with a particular corporate action, the honest choice demands either engaging in civil protest and accepting the consequences, or staging a symbolic protest (such as culture jamming, parody, or satire) that is clearly identifiable as an act of protest. The Shell Oil hoax did not announce itself as a parody (though a discerning viewer could detect it), and so neglects the second standard. Satire or parody should be obvious -- maybe not immediately, but soon -- or it is in danger of becoming little more than misrepresentation. Sometimes misrepresentation is the clear intent of the protester. There is a place in a democratic society for such acts; civil disobedience and other mildly illegal protests have a long history in the United States. But one must cross legal boundaries, even in protest, with a willingness to accept the consequences. If the Shell Oil hoax is determined by a court to violate a law (such as trademark infringement), Greenpeace and the Yes Men should man up, accept the verdict and pay the appropriate penalty. I doubt that such a verdict will impede people from using social media as a medium of protest. But if tactics like the Shell Oil hoax become accepted and common, they can easily backfire; opponents could just as easily use the same strategy against an organization like Greenpeace. A culture jamming war would do no one any good. The information overload online is already overwhelming and confusing enough. We don't need a situation where we have to question the validity of every website and video we click on. Let's keep it clean, everyone -- tell us who you are, and then take your best shot. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Root Wolpe.","Greenpeace, Yes Men stage hoax about Shell Oil company using fake website and video .

"(CNN) -- The call girl involved in the sex scandal with former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer filed a lawsuit Monday suing the founder of the ""Girls Gone Wild"" video series for more than $10 million. Ashley Alexandra Dupre says she posed for ""Girls Gone Wild"" as a teen. In the complaint filed in Miami, Florida, Ashley Alexandra Dupre says she was vacationing in Miami Beach when she was approached by agents and representatives of the defendant, Joe Francis, and offered alcoholic drinks. While intoxicated, Dupre was persuaded to expose her breasts and then told to sign a release form, according to a statement from her legal counsel, Richard C. Wolfe. Wolfe contends that Dupre ""was 17 years old and therefore not legally competent to enter into a contract with the defendants."" Dupre was the high-priced call girl, known as ""Kristen,"" documented in court papers as the woman Spitzer arranged to meet at Washington's Mayflower Hotel in February. Spitzer's involvement turned up in a federal investigation of suspicious transfers from his checking account. The investigation led agents to the alleged organizers of a prostitution ring, four of whom were charged in a criminal complaint in March. Spitzer resigned when a leak identified him as a client of the ring. In March, Francis was negotiating to pay Dupre $1 million to appear in the ""Girls Gone Wild"" magazine and on the company's touring bus. The deal fell through when Francis found he already owned video footage of Dupre. Francis said Monday he and his company ""have nothing to worry about."" ""But I think it's ironic that she charged Gov. Spitzer $2,000 for sex and she wants to charge me 10 million for taking some naked pictures of her,"" Francis told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Perhaps the biggest splash in the early going of this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles was made by Microsoft with its unveiling of Xbox SmartGlass. And while there's a video-gaming aspect to it, the feature promises a lot more (which, to be honest, is the sort of thing that plays bigger in the rest of the world than it does at E3, where the crowd is heavily made up of hard-core gamers who were probably more excited about the preview of ""Halo 4""). Less than a day after SmartGlass was introduced, details are still emerging about how it will work. But what's clear is that the application, which will work hand in hand with the upcoming Windows 8 operating system, is Microsoft's play to make the Xbox 360 an indispensable tool for all kinds of entertainment. First of all ... SmartGlass is not a kind of glass. Maybe it's the buzz about the Gorilla Glass featured on the new Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone. Or the fact that touchscreens are a key part of the feature. Or -- you know -- the fact that they called it SmartGlass. But some folks have been confused on that score. The feature is actually an app. It will work with the Windows 8 operating system, which runs on both PCs and mobile devices, to link up tablets and smartphones with the Xbox console and, by extension, a user's TV. So I need a Windows phone or tablet? No, you don't. Obviously, Microsoft would prefer you buy something such as the Nokia Lumia 900 or one of the many tablets expected to be released once a final version of Windows 8 is up and running later this year. But SmartGlass will also work with Apple devices, such as the iPhone and iPad, or mobile devices running Google's Android operating system. As long as you have an Xbox 360 and either a PC running Windows 8, mobile devices running Windows 8 or an iOS or Android device, you're good to go. How is this different? There are other products that do similar things -- from Apple's AirPlay, which streams content from an iPhone or iPad to your TV, to apps such as HBO Go that provide bonus content to enhance TV shows and movies. But, at least as Microsoft describes it, SmartGlass will pull lots of those features together into one app as well as take them further. Yes, you can start watching a show on your tablet or phone, then send it to your TV or vice versa. But they say the app also will recognize TV shows or movies you were watching through an Xbox device and automatically serve up that content without you having to look for it. During a demo at Microsoft's media event Monday, as the speaker watched a scene from HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" a map of the show's expansive world popped up. Then, there's the gaming aspect. Much as Nintendo's promised Wii U incorporates a handheld device with gameplay on a traditional console, players will be able to enhance gameplay on their mobile devices as well. During the demo, a tablet was used to call a football play in ""Madden '12."" Add to that the voice and motion-control abilities already available with the Xbox Kinect system, and you can see Microsoft's vision for making the console a centerpiece for all electronic entertainment. If the Xbox is the brains, SmartGlass ""gives users the limbs needed for a full functional, self-sufficient media beast,"" Gizmodo wrote. When? And how much? The app is free. So, as long as you have the right hardware, there presumably will be no extra cost. Microsoft says SmartGlass will be available this fall, which is about the same time a final version of Windows 8 has been promised.","Xbox SmartGlass aims to make the console a key entertainment component .

"(CNN) -- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani was in stable condition late Tuesday after he was rushed to a Baghdad hospital Monday night, his office said. In a statement issued Tuesday night, the president's office said tests ""have shown that the health status of His Excellency was caused by hardening of the arteries."" ""The tests also showed that the body functions are normal and the health status of the president is stable,"" the statement said. ""He is subject to focused medical attention under the supervision of a specialized Iraqi medical team."" But an Iraqi Kurdish lawmaker close to Talabani said earlier that the 79-year-old leader had suffered a stroke. ""His health condition is not very good,"" said Mahmoud Othman, who said he was headed to the hospital to visit Talabani earlier Tuesday. Othman said Talabani was in intensive care. Another official said Talabani had a stroke, but the president's office had released a statement earlier saying that he was exhausted. ""Recently, His Excellency President Jalal Talabani spent exhaustive efforts in order to accomplish harmony and stability in the country. Due to fatigue and exhaustion, His Excellency had a health emergency,"" the president's office said Tuesday. Also read: More than two dozen dead in second day of Iraq violence . Talabani was elected president of Iraq in 2005, in the nation's first free elections in more than 50 years. This is not the first time he has dealt with serious medical issues, and at times, the exact nature of his ailments have been shrouded in secrecy. In February 2007, he fell ill and was flown to Jordan for treatment, and there were conflicting reports about what prompted his hospitalization. A hospital source told CNN at the time that doctors performed a catheterization procedure on his heart, but his family and aides denied that. Talabani's doctor and a spokesman for the president's office said then that he was suffering from exhaustion and lung inflammation, and underwent tests they described as precautionary. He did not return to Iraq until March. Two months later, Talabani left for medical tests and to lose weight, his office said. He did not return until June. In January 2012, he had spinal surgery in Germany. Read more: Iraqi vice president predicts return to sectarian violence .

"(CNN) -- Soccer star Lionel Messi must appear in court on September 17 to face possible charges of tax fraud, prosecutors in Spain said Thursday. The four-time world player of the year and his father Jorge Horacio Messi are suspected of defrauding Spanish tax authorities of more than $5 million between 2006 and 2009. They deny the charges. A judge will decide after the hearing whether to go ahead with the case, which is being held in a town near Barcelona -- where Messi has lived since moving from his native Argentina as a teenager. Messi, who turns 26 next Monday, is 10th on the list of the world's highest-paid athletes as compiled by business magazine Forbes with earnings of $41 million. According to the papers filed on June 12 by prosecutor Raquel Amado in Gava, a seaside resort close to Barcelona where Messi lives, it is alleged that they tried to avoid paying taxes in Spain by selling the player's image rights through overseas companies. His club Barcelona said it was not involved, as the image rights payments are independent of the reported $20 million yearly salary he receives from the Spanish champion team. Messi used his Facebook website page to deny the charges earlier this month. ""We have just known through the media about the claim filed by the Spanish tax authorities,"" read the statement in Spanish and English. ""We are surprised about the news, because we have never committed any infringement. ""We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation."" Messi joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000, and has won six Primera Liga titles, three European Champions League crowns. Last year he scored an unprecedented 86 goals for club and country.

"(CNN) -- A man originally from Eritrea was sentenced Wednesday to more than nine years in U.S. federal prison after pleading guilty last year to conspiring with Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked terror organization, prosecutors said. Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed, a 38-year-old resident of Sweden, received his 111-month sentence in a New York City federal court, said Preet Bharara, U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Ahmed traveled to Somalia to receive military training from the terror group, federal officials said. Al-Shabaab has made several public statements threatening to harm the United States. ""Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed traveled thousands of miles to align himself with al-Shabaab, to aid their campaign of terror and to learn their 'ways of war,'"" Bharara said in a statement. ""Today, his journey ends in prison and marks the latest victory in our constant effort to protect Americans from terrorism at home and abroad."" In addition to the prison term, Ahmed will be deported upon completion of his sentence, prosecutors said. Ahmed pleaded guilty last June to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab and one count of conspiracy to receive military-type training from it, prosecutors said. In a March 29, 2012, letter to a federal judge, prosecutors said a former top leader of Al-Shabaab may have testified against Ahmed if his case were to go to trial. That former leader is Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, who also had ties to al Qaeda and who secretly pleaded guilty in 2011 to federal charges, the Justice Department said Monday. He has provided the U.S. government with valuable intelligence information, the Justice Department said. The U.S. military captured Warsame at sea in April 2011 while he was traveling from Yemen to Somalia. He pleaded guilty in New York the following December to nine terrorism charges. Al-Shabaab has tried to destabilize the government of Somalia in a ""holy war"" and has recruited foreign fighters from other countries, including the United States, to engage in violent jihad, prosecutors said. Ahmed was arrested in Nigeria in 2009 after authorities say he traveled to Somalia to undergo bomb-making and bomb-detonation training from members of Al-Shabaab, authorities said. While he was in Somalia, Ahmed paid 3,000 euros (about $3,830) to Al-Shabaab and gave an AK-47 rifle and magazines to a military commander in the group, according to court documents.","Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed is sentenced to 111 months in prison .

"Washington (CNN) -- Amid criticism from his Republican opponent that his foreign policy ""projects weakness,"" President Barack Obama confronted Iran and Syria on Tuesday and warned those who killed an American diplomat in Libya that they would be held accountable. ""The attacks on our civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America,"" Obama told the United Nations General Assembly. ""There should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice."" Both GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have in recent days challenged Obama's foreign policy record, which is perceived to be a strength for the incumbent. Obama confronts Iran, Syria; UNGA debate opens . In the battleground state of Colorado on Monday, Romney said Obama's characterization of the recent unrest in the Middle East as a ""bump in the road"" belittled the gravity of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11 that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. ""Bumps in the road?"" Romney asked. ""We had an ambassador assassinated. We had a Muslim Brotherhood member elected to the presidency of Egypt. Twenty thousand people have been killed in Syria. We have tumult in Pakistan and, of course, Iran is that much closer to having the capacity to build a nuclear weapon."" Romney hammers Obama on 'bumps in the road' Ryan said during a bus tour through the swing state of Ohio that Obama's policies ""project weakness."" ""When you project American weakness - the superpower projecting weakness - that creates a vacuum, that creates a void,"" Ryan added. ""That void gets filled by people in countries who do not share our interests. It means our adversaries are that much more tempted to test us and our allies are much less likely to trust us, like Israel."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told reporters in a conference call on Monday organized by the Romney campaign that the absence of any bilateral meetings at the United Nations, including with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demonstrated an unwillingness to engage on issues that could become pitfalls for American diplomacy. Netanyahu has pressed the United States for a stronger line on Iran and Obama clarified his position on the issue in his U.N. remarks. ""America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so,"" the president said. ""But that time is not unlimited."" ""Make no mistake,"" he continued, ""a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained."" The president praised the Libyan government for its cooperation in investigating the attacks that killed Stevens, but he defended freedom of speech -- the unrest in the Muslim world grew out of a film produced in the United States that mocked the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. ""The strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression it is more speech,"" Obama said adding that, ""there is no speech that justifies mindless violence."" Slain envoy's legacy 'will live on in the lives he touched' Clinton hosts Obama and Romney . Romney continued the conversation about the Middle East, albeit in a less confrontational way, when he spoke at the Clinton Global Initiative on Tuesday, tying his plan for economic development through trade and free enterprise to stability in the region. ""Religious extremism is certainly part of the problem,"" Romney said of the tension and violence in the Middle East. ""But that's not the whole story."" Citing the Tunisian fruit vendor who set himself on fire and sparked the Arab Spring, Romney said the vendor who was humiliated by government forces wanted to provide for his family. The freedom of an individual to work, Romney said, is at the core of his foreign aid plan. ""Work. That must be at the heart of our effort to help people build economies that can create jobs for people, young and old alike,"" Romney said. Romney makes Clinton joke--in front of Clinton . When Romney addressed the Clinton event, he unveiled what his campaign calls his ""Prosperity Pact,"" a re-engineering of the way America approaches foreign assistance. Romney's plan ties U.S. trade policy to development in foreign nations by identifying barriers to trade and investment in developing countries. If the countries cooperated in working to remove the barriers, then Romney's plan would open trade to the countries and deliver development packages focusing on strengthening basic tenants of democracy. Romney lays out 'aid with trade' in major foreign policy speech . Following his remarks at the United Nations, Obama addressed the Clinton group on human trafficking, saying it ""must be called by its true name -- modern slavery."" The president signed an executive order on Tuesday to strengthen protections so that federal contractors aren't using forced labor. Obama said the order raised the bar. ""In short, we're making clear that American tax dollars must never, ever be used to support the trafficking of human beings,"" he said. The CNN Freedom Project: ending modern-day slavery . Obama's remarks also may resonate with Evangelical Christians since human trafficking is an issue that many churches in that community have organized to fight. Rescuing girls from sex slavery is also an issue that may resonate with some women voters. More than 20 million men, women and children are victims of human trafficking worldwide, according to the executive order. Obama called on countries worldwide to enact and enforce laws preventing and punishing human trafficking. Obama: America could survive Romney, but wouldn't thrive . The president and first lady Michelle Obama's taped appearance on ABC's ""The View"" appeared on Tuesday as well. Saying she was channeling Elizabeth Hasselbeck, the show's vocal Republican co-host, Barbara Walters asked the president if it would be terrible for the country if Romney won. ""We can survive a lot,"" Obama answered, saying he thought Romney was a good man and means well. ""But the American people don't want to just survive. We want to thrive. I've just got a different vision of how we grow an economy. We grow fastest when the middle class is doing well,"" Obama said. The Obamas also talked about their relationship. The couple says that instead of the presidency making their relationship tougher, it has brought them closer together. ""We spend more time together in some ways than we did earlier in our marriage because I live above the store,"" the president explained ""I have a 30 second commute."" Michelle Obama: I can make the president mad . Still, he said the weight of the office taught them to ""talk the big stuff but don't sweat the small stuff."" Republicans have criticized Obama for taping ""The View"" while in New York but not meeting with world leaders. Reunited and it feels so good . After his trip to New York, Romney reunited with Ryan and his campaign's bus tour at a rally in Vandalia, Ohio, just north of Dayton. Romney joked about the battleground state's Republican senator, Rob Portman, who has been playing Obama in debate preparations for the party's presidential nominee. ""He's so good ... after an hour and an half of debate I want to kick him out of the room,"" Romney said, adding that Portman likes his arguments. ""He knows they're right."" Romney also discussed job creation and taxes. Speaking to college students and recent college graduates, Romney pointed out that 50% of college graduates can't find jobs. ""Look at your friends, half of you can't work, don't you understand where [Barack Obama is] taking this country?"" Romney asked. Battleground polls show Obama ahead . New polls released in four swing states on Tuesday all indicate Obama ahead of Romney by four to eight points. The fresh batch of polls in Ohio, Florida, Iowa and Nevada - which together account for 59 electoral votes - were released by the Washington Post and American Research Group and were all conducted over the past six days, after the release of secretly recorded clips from a May fund-raiser, in which Romney casts Obama supporters as dependent on government. The story dominated coverage of the race for the White House last week. In each survey, Obama's advantage is within the poll's sampling error, but each survey indicates the president grabbing at least 50 percent of the likely voters interviewed. Fresh polls give Obama the advantage in four crucial battlegrounds . Poll: Obama up by five points in Ohio .

"(CNN) -- ""What kind of sneakers is she going to have to wear?"" This is one of many questions going through my head. It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome. I am only 16 years old, just days away from my 17th birthday. I am a good student, sister and shoe lover. (Hence the reason why sneaker choice would be one of my great fears about this baby's diagnosis.) I do not want to deal with Velcro versus ties or orthopedic shoes; I want to pick out the latest trends and styles for her. With this diagnosis, I am now faced with the challenge of redefining every goal and dream I had for my daughter. I am scared, naturally. My friends are all out celebrating senior year, and here I am asking myself stupid questions. After a few agonizing days I realize she is my child. I love her. Does it really matter what kind of shoes she has on? It doesn't. This child isn't even born yet, and she has already taught me a lesson. I no longer care about shoes and shopping; I just want my baby to live. I want her to be born healthy and be happy. So I make up my mind that just because she has Down Syndrome, I don't have to give up all of my dreams for her. I can still buy her cool sneakers and shoes; we just might need to look harder for ones that offer support as well. Opinion: Don't label people with Down syndrome . A month goes by and Jaylin is born -- a healthy 4-pound, 12-ounce baby girl with a head full of black hair. She was born with a heart defect, but it gets corrected six months after birth. A little while after that, she begins wearing her new pink Nike crib shoes. Most babies grow out of those kinds of shoes soon after birth, but not my little Jaybird. Down Syndrome can slow physical and intellectual development. She rocked those shoes for a good couple of months. These days, Jaylin is doing well. She goes shoe shopping with me and her current pick is a multicolored pair of Nike high tops. I don't think she truly cares about shoes but just enjoys spending the time with me picking them out. She teaches me and her teachers more than we teach her. I am so happy that I was blessed with her and that she changed my views on life. Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now. I currently organize a Buddy Walk with some other moms, and we use funds from the walk to donate care packages to families facing hospital stays due to complications of Down Syndrome. Jaylin is almost 6, and this year was our fifth Buddy Walk. I started the walks in honor of her, and it is because of her that I can reach out to other families now. Having a baby with Down Syndrome made that 17-year-old me grow up fast but strong. Jaylin is such a special child. She takes her time when most of us want her to rush, and she is always the one smiling when everyone else is melting down. She will not let the world define her. She will keep doing what she loves, in great shoes, just to make me happy.","Down Syndrome is a genetic condition that causes delays in development .

"(CNN) -- Another cruise ship, another problem with malfunctioning toilets. This time, Carnival Corp. subsidiary Princess Cruises had passengers feeling the impact of toilets that wouldn't flush. On April 11, the cruise line's Crown Princess was on a seven-day Caribbean cruise when a blockage within the ship's vacuum toilet system rendered 410 stateroom toilets inoperable from 5 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., according to Princess Cruises spokeswoman Karen Candy. The ship has more than 1,500 cabins. ""A small number of passengers continued to experience problems over the next few days which were addressed by the shipboard technical team,"" Candy wrote in an e-mail. The ship's itinerary wasn't affected by the flushing problems, and affected passengers were offered $50 apiece in compensation, Candy wrote. ""The blockages have been addressed and we are continuing to review the situation to ensure that the system is working with optimum pressure levels."" Although Candy didn't answer questions about the cause of the problem, members of the CruiseCritic.com website discussed the possibility of passengers tossing prohibited objects into the toilets and causing the blockage. ""Toilet problems can happen on any ship when passengers flush the wrong things down the toilet,"" wrote member Astro Flyer, who was not aboard the Crown Princess. In February, an engine room fire left the Carnival Triumph adrift in the Gulf of Mexico, with passengers reporting overflowing toilets and human waste running down the walls in some parts of the ship. On a March cruise, the Carnival Dream lost power, and some toilets stopped working. Both ships are part of Carnival Cruise Line, another subsidiary of Carnival Corp. Candy wrote that ""passengers were kept continuously updated about the progress of the repairs."" But a CruiseCritic member posting under the handle EB and Curly said they were in an affected cabin and ""were never informed as to the status of repairs."" However, they were ""only totally without a toilet for about 24 hours. It did overflow one night and we had to call maintenance to come up at 1:00 a.m."" CruiseCritic.com reported that the ship left Galveston, Texas, on April 13 for its scheduled trans-Atlantic repositioning cruise to Europe.","A ship in the Carnival Corp. portfolio experienced toilet problems on a recent sailing .

"LifeWire provides original and syndicated lifestyle content to Web publishers. Joan Shim is a freelance writer and former editor at Pet Product News. (LifeWire) --  If you take a multivitamin every morning and perhaps a supplement or two because you care about your health, does it make sense to do the same with your dog or cat? Stephanie Pendleton of Emerald Isle, North Carolina, would say yes. The pet supplement market has grown into a $1.3 billion business. Pendleton caught on to pet supplements a few years ago when she noticed that her 13-year-old cat, Sierra, wasn't up to her usual antics. ""She was having a hard time jumping up on the counter, and she wasn't playing as much as she used to,"" Pendleton says. ""Finally, she just spent less time up there, I think, because it was painful for her."" Pendleton researched Sierra's problem online, and learned about the joint supplements glucosamine and chondroitin. She asked her veterinarian, and they agreed to give the cat a product that combines both joint supplements. ""Sierra is jumping all over the place again,"" Pendleton says. Now, Pendleton is a believer in pet supplements. She gives Sierra and her other cat, 2-year-old Serenity, a multivitamin, probiotics to help their immune systems and essential fatty acids for skin and coat health. Sierra gets seven pills, Serenity four. Demand for supplements is on the rise. The pet supplement market has grown about 15 percent annually since 2000 and is now a $1.3 billion business, according to the National Animal Supplement Council. Simmons Market Research Bureau says approximately 17 percent of pet owners give their cats and dogs some type of supplement. A pet supplement is a product that is intended to complement the diet and help support and maintain a normal biological function. Products range from multivitamins for overall health to targeted formulas that claim to alleviate joint problems or canine cognitive dysfunction. Dr. Tim Montague, a veterinarian at Eads Animal Hospital in Eads, Tennessee, started using supplements in 1992. He was wary at first because he didn't learn about them in veterinary school, and there weren't many on the market. But when an old professor of his recommended a joint supplement for one of Montague's patients, he took notice. Montague's golden retriever Ayla had an arthritic shoulder, so he also tried a joint supplement on her. ""She could barely make it up and down the stairs, but within a week after the supplement she was running and catching Frisbees in the yard,"" Montague says. ""That sold me on that product."" He said his patients have had good success with joint supplements and he prescribes them all the time. But some substances, such as St. John's wort, may not be suitable for pets, according to the Food and Drug Administration, and their safety and effectiveness is untested in animals. What's more, some supplements have been found to contain lesser amounts of an active ingredient than the manufacturer claims, or substances like lead have been detected. Dr. Tod Cooperman is president of ConsumerLab.com, which independently tests supplements for humans and animals. In the past few years, his company has reviewed roughly a dozen multivitamins, joint supplements and fish oils for pets and found that about half of the products tested don't pass. ""We have repeatedly found the quality of supplements for pets to be worse overall than for supplements for people,"" Cooperman says. With the pet supplement market burgeoning, especially online, the FDA urges pet owners to talk to their veterinarians before giving supplements to their animals, something Montague agrees with. ""People need to be careful about self-medicating,"" he says. ""I've seen many animals harmed by people getting the wrong information over the Internet."" Dr. John Bauer, professor of clinical nutrition at Texas A&M University's College of Veterinary Medicine, offers four factors to consider when evaluating supplements: . 1. Product quality How much of the functional, active ingredient is in the product? Responsible manufacturers will have 800 numbers on the package to call with technical questions about the ingredients, and your veterinarian should know what specific questions to ask. 2. Efficacy Is there any scientific basis to support the use of this supplement? If information about product testing isn't available on the company's Web site or elsewhere, call the company for details about the studies that have been performed. 3. Tolerance. Check the list of ingredients carefully before giving a supplement to your pet. For example, a supplement might include lactose, which some cats and dogs can't tolerate. It's a good idea to consult your veterinarian first to discuss how the supplements may react with any medications the pet is taking. 4. Safety. A product's safety should be proven. For example, the company might state in its literature that it was tested in high doses on mice and found to be safe, or the number of adverse events reported might be few to none.
