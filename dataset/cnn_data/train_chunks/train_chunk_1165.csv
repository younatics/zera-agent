"A rogue unit of police officers allegedly gunned down 10 members of a Brazilian gang in a six-hour killing spree in revenge for the death of a colleague, it has been reported. The co-ordinated attacks came hours after a mysterious and sinister warning began circulating on an instant messaging app telling residents to stay off street corners. Video also emerged purportedly showing one of the officers in a Scream mask threatening to kill 'at least 30 thugs' shortly before the rampage. Shocking footage and pictures later began circulating online apparently showing relatives and friends sobbing over dead bodies of the victims. Scroll down for video . Video has  emerged online purportedly showing an off-duty policeman in a Scream mask (above) threatening to kill 'at least 30 thugs' shortly before 10 members of a Brazilian gang were shot dead by rogue officers in an apparent revenge attack for the death of a colleague who was gunned down outside his home . Tensions surfaced in the northern Brazilian city of Belem last Tuesday after police officer Antonio Marcos da Silva Figueiredo, 43, was gunned down by three men outside his home. Video of gang members reportedly threatening to kill police officers later appeared on Facebook. Within hours of the shooting, rumours of an impending revenge attack began circulating on social media. A message also sent to terrified residents through the instant messaging service, What's App, warning them not to leave the house. According to the BBC, it read: 'Don’t go to Guama, Canudos or Terra Firme tonight. It concerns your security. One of our policemen was killed and we will be cleaning the area. 'There’s no stopping any of us, not even the highest colonel. The boys are on the loose. Please stay at home. Don’t go hanging out on street corners.' The message is believed to have originated from one of the renegade officers. Gunned down: Shocking footage and pictures began circulating online apparently showing relatives and friends sobbing over dead bodies of victims after they were allegedly shot by renegade police officers. However, Para State's Security Secretary said many of the images showed people killed in unrelated attacks . Witnesses claim the police officers then went on a six-hour shooting spree on motorbikes, dragging victims from cars and executing them in the street. One father told local media that his son's body was riddled with dozens of bullet holes. Speaking to the BBC, resident Joao Batista, 19, said of the WhatsApp messages: 'This is the first time I remember seeing something like this spread right around the city and cause such fear.' Disturbing footage and pictures later began circulating online that appeared to show the victims lying in blood in the road. However, Para State's Security Secretary said many of the images showed people killed in unrelated incidents. Walrimar Sousa, a spokesman for the state Civil Police in Belém, told the Wall Street Journal: 'All of the murders are under investigation. 'f there is any evidence that police officers were involved they will be investigated and held responsible. It is too early to say police were involved.' Earlier this year, police officers reportedly killed 12 people in revenge attacks after a colleague was shot in the Brazilian city of Campinas.","Tensions erupted after police officer was shot dead outside home in Belem .

"Trudging through IKEA's vast showrooms looking for the right bunkbeds for the kids' bedroom can be a wearying chore. So it can be a blessed relief to flop down on one of the beds or sofas on display for a few minutes rest - even if its not strictly 'try before you buy'. But on the other side of the world from the flatpack firm's native Sweden, these Chinese customers really do seem to have shopped until they've dropped. Blessed relief: A Chinese shopper sleeps on a bed in the showroom of the IKEA store on Beijing, China . Room for two: A woman curls up with her baby on a rather ruffled bed in the cool, air-conditioned IKEA store . No pictures! A woman hides her face with a fan after kicking off her shoes and putting her feet up on a sofa . Desperate for some rest: This shopper doesn't care that the bed he's sleeping on has not yet been made . Sweaty Betty: Even with air conditioning cooling the pace, sleeping on leather is risky . Run out of beds? A woman takes her nap on a high-backed swivel chair in one of the shop's mocked-up rooms . Tiring: Another pair of shattered shoppers flop over the flatpack furniture . Lounging: This corner sofa is so sumptuous and expansive that there's room for two total strangers to sleep . IKEA's massive Beijing store - one of the world's biggest - is a favourite siesta spot for stressed city slickers looking for a place to rest from the mid-summer heat. Most don't want to buy anything, but have instead visited for the express purpose of taking a nap, catching up with friends, or just to bask in the cool air-conditioned climate. Visiting IKEA without the need for a Billy bookcase or endless storage solutions, but simply to enjoy the comfort of a Lervik frame or the bounce of a Malm may seem ludicrous, but in China it's a growing trend. Despite the country's burgeoning economic might, many Chinese still live in cramped conditions in old-fashioned homes, as a state-mandated building boom churns out millions of properties normal people can't afford. IKEA hasn't taken any measures against people making themselves at home, because it sees it as a future investment. Cool: Most of the visitors have come to take advantage of the shop's air conditioning - an expensive luxury . Accommodating: Staff don't try to remove them, their presence is seen as an investment in the brand's future . Cushion cuddlers: Many Chinese cannot yet afford the luxuries of IKEA furniture, but they hope to soon . Siesta sofa: There is plenty of room in the huge Beijing store - one of the world's largest - for all the sleepers . Stretching out: Many Chinese still live in cramped conditions in old-fashioned homes . Couch potatoes: IKEA is the world's largest furniture company, with profits last year of £2.7billion . Much of the increase in those profits has been driven by expansion into new markets like Russia and China . So even if these customers can't afford a Billy bookcase now, IKEA is betting they will be able to soon... IKEA was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943. It is now the world’s largest furniture retailer, recording an annual net profit of £2.7billion in 2013, from sales of £22.1billion in 44 countries. It opened up its first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to eight of the top-10 largest IKEAs in the world. There are more IKEA catalogues than bibles printed each year, and it is said that one in ten Europeans is now conceived in an IKEA bed.","Staff at the store make no effort to remove the sleeping visitors .

"The family of a grandmother run over by a Bronx teen on Thanksgiving Eve is outraged over the lack of remorse in social media posts made while the matriarch lie brain dead in a hospital. Ashley Viviana Davios, 19, spent the day after Thanksgiving posting about leftovers and needing clear her head – while Maria Lucaj, 55, was dying in a hospital. The teen ran over Ms Lucaj as she rounded a corner in her 2013 Ford Focus just after 6pm Nov 27, according to the New York Post. Not a care in the world: Ashley Viviana Davios (left) acted online as if she never ran over Maria Lucaj (right) The distraught teen stayed at the scene and did not appear intoxicated, sources told the paper. She said she did not see the woman in the crosswalk. Ms Lucaj, who had the right of way, died later Thanksgiving weekend. Criticism of the teen has come from a series of tweets made as the grandmother’s devastated family made preparations for her death and remained beside her hospital bed. Shortly after telling friends she wanted to go to SoHo, she sent an eye-opening tweet that surely caused people to wonder who much remorse she felt. ‘All I really need right now is to clear my head and find peace of mind,’ she tweeted. Not long after, she tweeted a picture of food with the caption ‘LEFTOVERS.’ She followed that up by retweeting the message ‘I love the holidays because I was able to see everyone that truly matters.’ No remorse: Ms Davios was more worried about leftovers, clearing her head and shopping than she was the woman she ran over with her car . As if not bad enough, she fired out the following tweet the day after Ms Lucaj died from the injuries resulting from being mowed down. ‘Karma needs to just slap the s–t out of you.’ The dead matriarch’s family was in disbelief when told of the tweets. ‘I couldn’t believe it,’ son Robert told the Post. ‘She’s posting about leftovers while my mother’s brain-dead in the hospital.’ Only a day later: The toxic teen posted this tweet the day after the grandmother died . ‘She was showing no remorse,’ son Martin said, adding his mother was only steps from home – where she was going to prepare her family’s Thanksgiving meal. ‘To see [on Twitter] a meal that we weren’t able to have was heartbreaking,’ he added. Attempts by MailOnline to reach Ms Davios via phone and email were not answered. Her Twitter account has since been deleted. Police have yet to charge the teen with any crime, but the investigation is ongoing.","Ashley Viviana Davios, 19, mowed down Maria Lucaj, 55, at a Bronx crosswalk on Thanksgiving Eve .

"The Indonesian man who was known as Schapelle Corby's boyfriend has faced a Bali court for the first time since he was arrested for being in possession of marijuana nearly three months ago. Bernard P. Simanjunta, commonly referred to as Ben Panangian, admitted handling the drug and told the Denpasar District Court on Tuesday he would be representing himself during his trial. He also denied being romantically involved with convicted Australian drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, saying he only knows her 'as a friend'. Scroll down for video . Indonesian police arrested Bernard P. Simanjunta (pictured in orange) for possessing nine grams of cannabis on August 20 . The 32-year-old also denied being romantically involved with convicted Australian drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, saying he only knows her 'as a friend' It comes after Panagian was allegedly caught with marijuana when he was searched on a Bali street on August 20 and later found more in his wardrobe. Police said they seized a total of nine grams of cannabis and arrested him. Panangian, 32, acknowledged the police statement were correct during his first day of trial, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. When one of the judges on the panel questioned him twice about his relationship status with Corby, Panagian was adamant that the infamous Australian is just a friend. 'Friend or friend?' the judge asked. 'I know her just as a friend,' Panangian said. Also known as Ben Panangian, he told the Denpasar District Court on Tuesday that he would be representing himself during his trial . Corby and Panagian (pictured together) have been linked as early as 2006 after meeting in jail while both were serving time for drug offences . Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of cannabis to Indonesia . Corby was released from Bali's Kerobokan Prison five months ago after serving nine years in jail for couriering 4.2 kilograms of marijuana to Indonesia in her boogie board bag in 2004. She was stopped by officers at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar and was sentenced 20 years behind bars in 2005. She was later granted a five-year sentence reduction. Corby reportedly met Panangian, who had been locked up for drug charges, when they were both inmates serving time in prison. While imprisoned, Corby claimed she suffered from extreme depression and shared with a psychiatrist her thoughts on suicide. Her parole conditions state that she must not be involved with crime. Following his arrest in August, Corby's mother Rosleigh Rose has since claimed to Nine News that her daughter is not dating Panangian. Her denial comes despite Corby and Panagian being linked as early as 2006 after meeting in jail while both were serving time for drug offences, according to The Australian Women's Weekly. At the time of Panangian's arrest, police said they had no plans to investigate Corby because the pair's relationship is unclear. Corby lives with her sister, Mercedes, in the tourist area of Kuta. It's believed she now works at her sister's surfboard and swimwear shop on the island. Panangian faces a maximum of 12 years in prison if he is found guilty, the Herald Sun previously reported.","Indonesian police arrested Bernard P.

"Forget the iPad, you'd be better off giving your children Play-Doh to keep them entertained on a plane, according to new research. A social experiment led by Professor Robert Winston found that old-fashioned fun is all you need to keep children happy in-flight - contrary to popular belief. The research comes as parents revealed that their biggest concern when flying was keeping their children entertained, with 60 per cent admitting they fail to keep kids distracted for more than 30 minutes. Building blocks: Finn Garrett and Professor Robert Winston get to grips with Lego on board the flight . A quarter of parents surveyed said they . worried about their children disturbing other passengers, while more . than half were nervous about disrupting their youngster’s sleeping . pattern. British Airways conducted the social experiment in response to the survey, by placing 30 youngsters on a flight for two hours with a selection of toys. The children, aged two to 10, were given 90 minutes playtime and observed by scientist and TV personality Robert Winston and a team of educational psychologists. Entertained: Cathy West and Elodie, 2, play with stuffed toys and Play-Doh on board the lfight . The surprising findings revealed that it was actually the cheapest toys that kept the children occupied for the longest. 1.    Loom Bands2.    Playdoh3.    Lego4.    Top Trumps5.    Uno6.    Usborne Activity Cards7.    Magnetic travel game 8.    Aquadoodle! 9.    Finger puppets 10.  Sticker book . Play-Doh and toy-of-the-moment Loom Bands topped the list with 80 per cent of children and 70 per cent of parents saying they would take these on a flight in the future. Both toys, costing just 74p and £1.99 respectively, kept more than half of the children occupied for longer than 40 minutes. The most popular toy among two to five year olds was Play-Doh, while Loom Bands were a firm favourite with the five to 10 year olds. Timeless classics such as Lego and Top Trump cards also scored highly with this age group; keeping them entertained for an average of 37 and 33 minutes respectively. Professor Winston, said: 'Although the temptation is for parents to play a film in the hope that their child falls asleep, activity based toys, such as lego, sticker books and travel games are also a great way to keep them engaged. 'Bringing out a different toy at regular intervals is guaranteed to keep them quiet for longer than 90 minutes.' Simple pleasures: The study, which also included participant Archie Sturt, 3, with his mother Nicola Sturt, found children don't need high-tech games to be entertained . 1.  Have drinks to hand they can sip on for take off and landing so they . don't concentrate on the air pressure; which can affect children more . than adults2.  Buy new toys and games for the flight as newer toys entertain them for longer3.  Bring out different toys at regular intervals. Wrapping them and giving them as presents works really well4.  Concentrate on packing activities as opposed to static objects such as dolls and cuddly toys 5.  Think of games with extended play. Finger puppets and activity cards . are both toys that can be drawn out to last a lot longer6.  Think about games that you don't need to carry. Verbal games like I Spy . and Twenty Questions are good ways to pass the flight time7.  If it's an evening or night flight take pyjamas. Getting children ready . for bed will help avoid disrupting their sleep pattern. Dr Vivian Hill, educational psychologist from the Institute of Education, said: 'Toys that spark the imagination and encourage creativity, rather than static toys like soft toys and dolls, are proven to keep children occupied for sustained periods.' Ian Ellis, toys buyer at John Lewis, said: 'Loom bands have been hugely popular. We started selling them at John Lewis a couple of months ago and in the last few weeks we have really seen them take off. It has been such a big playground phenomenon with children wanting the newest colours and sets, we will be introducing more to our range as the trend continues.'","Professor Robert Winstone led the social experiment on a two-hour flight .

"As hitch-hiking goes, it’s not normally a helicopter that stops to provide the transport. But then it’s not every day that the passengers getting a lift are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. William, Kate and pet dog Lupo were the recipients of a free ride from a friend flying past their home in North Wales. He picked them up then, after a 200 mile flight, dropped them off at an aerodrome on the outskirts of London. Homeward bound: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and dog Lupo with Simon Oliphant-Hope after landing at Denham, south Buckinghamshire . Coming in to land: The Duchess of Cambridge can be seen through the helicopter window (right) as it touches down in Buckinghamshire . Their arrival was photographed by a surprised - and delighted - couple watching light aircraft taking off and landing at Denham in south Bucks. When the brightly coloured helicopter arrived at the small grass airfield they had no clue to the identities of the VIPs aboard and didn’t initially recognise them. They said: ‘We had no idea it was the royal couple at the time. ‘We had a look at the photos on our laptop a few days later and realised that it was in fact Prince William and Kate. ‘It’s amazing to think that we saw the royal couple without any crowds around them. ‘They were like any other couple out with their dog - albeit having just been flown in by helicopter. ‘Lupo was very well behaved. Kate let him down on to the grass and he stayed close, although you could see he was excited.’ Taking charge: Prince William is seen talking to the helicopter pilot while Kate (partially obscured left) is seen holding on to Lupo . Denham must be getting used to Royal visitors dropping in. A week earlier the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall had to make an emergency landing in their helicopter at the airfield. Charles and Camilla were 15 minutes into their journey to the Hay Festival in Wales from central London when a ‘technical problem’ with the rear rotor blade forced their pilot to divert to the nearest airfield. Dressed down: Prince William was dressed slightly more casually than when he was pictured at the wedding of Thomas Van Straubenzee, 30, and Lady Melissa Percy, 26, at Alnwick Castle on Saturday . The aircraft, understood to be carrying seven people, made an urgent controlled landing - later described as ‘hairy’ - at Denham and the royal couple continued their journey by road. The orange McDonnell Douglas helicopter carrying William and Kate belongs to Shoreham-based Eastern Atlantic Helicopters, whose managing director Simon Oliphant-Hope is a friend of the couple. The four-seater is no ordinary aircraft. In 2004 Mr Oliphant Hope used it to circumnavigate the globe in a record time, flying solo around the world in just over 17 days. The ‘Royal’ flight last month was not on the same scale, the trip taking around 90 minutes - a distinct improvement on a car journey that would take nearer five hours. Both William and Kate were casually dressed in jeans with her baby bump clear to see as they walked away from the aircraft, which bears an uncanny resemblance to Budgie, the little helicopter in Sarah Ferguson’s children’s book. Kate carried cocker spaniel Lupo from the helicopter but let him loose to run obediently alongside the couple as they walked across the grass airfield . The Duke drove off in a Range Rover while Kate, who is due to give birth to their first child next month, left in a separate vehicle. Mr Oliphant Hope, 49, said: 'I know the couple and occasionally, when I am routing past North Wales, I give them a lift if it is convenient to all parties.’ Who was behind the controls of the US-registered helicopter is unclear. Mr Oliphant, who in 2009 provided a helicopter for David Cameron to travel to a conference in Harrogate, wasn’t saying. While he and Anglesey-based RAF search and rescue pilot William sat in the front with Kate, Lupo and a Royal detective in the rear, that model of helicopter can apparently be piloted from both right and left seat. A Royal source said: ‘The flight wasn’t paid for and the helicopter wasn’t chartered. There was no cost. It was a gift, a lift from a friend.’ VIP landing zone: Denham is no stranger to royalty landing at its airfield - a helicopter carrying Prince Charles and Camilla had to make an emergency landing there a week earlier .","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge landed at Denham, Buckinghamshire .

"Over-optimistic forecasts for passenger demand have left taxpayers 'saddled with £4.8billion of debt' over the HS1 Channel Tunnel rail link, a report by MPs said today. These 'unrealistic estimates' for the London to Folkestone HS1 link must not be repeated when the business case is made for the proposed London to Birmingham HS2 high-speed line, the report said. Total taxpayer support for the 68-mile HS1 over the period to 2070 is likely to be £10.2billion, the report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee added. A train passes over the Medway Bridge in Kent on its way into London using the HS1 Channel Tunnel Rail Link. Taxpayers have been 'saddled with £4.8billion of debt' due to over-optimistic forecasts for passenger demand, a report said today . International passenger numbers on HS1 are only a third of the 1995 original forecast and two-thirds of the level the Department for Transport (DfT) forecast in 1998, said the committee. It went on: 'Over-optimistic and unrealised forecasts for passenger demand on HS1 left the taxpayer saddled with £4.8'billion of debt.' The report added that the delivery of regeneration benefits from HS1, on which high-speed Eurostar trains travel, 'suffered from a lack of effective leadership from the centre'. The committee said the department 'does not have sufficient understanding of the economic impact and regeneration benefits of transport infrastructure, compared with alternatives, so is not able to make fully informed investment decisions'. The report added that the DfT 'gives insufficient attention to evaluating its major projects' and should develop evaluation frameworks for all current major projects including the under-construction cross-London Crossrail scheme and HS2. The LCR company was awarded the contract to build HS1 in 1996. The DfT agreed to restructure the deal in 1998, guaranteeing most of LCR’s debt, after Eurostar revenues were substantially below LCR’s forecasts. Commenting on the report today, Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: 'While HS1 provides an efficient service, contributing in an important way to British transport infrastructure, there were costly mistakes in the history of the project. These must not be repeated with HS2. 'HS1 was supposed to pay for itself but instead the taxpayer has had to pay out £4.8billion so far to cover the debt on the project.' HS1 hub: St Pancras station in central London. International passenger numbers on HS1 are only a third of the 1995 original forecast . Bullet train: The report added that the delivery of regeneration benefits from HS1, on which high-speed Eurostar trains travel, 'suffered from a lack of effective leadership from the centre' She went on: 'The root of the problem is the inaccurate and wildly optimistic forecasts for passenger numbers. 'The DfT failed to take into account the growth of low-cost airlines or the competitive response of the ferry companies. 'This . isn’t the first time that over-optimistic planning and insufficiently . robust testing of planning assumptions has got the department into . trouble. My committee’s report on the East Coast Mainline raised similar . concerns.' Ms Hodge said some of the DfT’s assumptions about the benefits of faster travel were 'simply untenable'. 'For . example, the time business travellers save by using high-speed rail is . valued at £54 per hour yet the time commuters save getting to and from . work is only valued at £7 per hour. 'It . is difficult to see how this can be justified. The department also . assumes that all time spent on a train is unproductive. And unrealistic . assumptions about ticket prices act to exaggerate passenger demand . forecasts.' Ms Hodge . continued: 'The DfT also told us that it had not considered the benefits . and costs of alternatives to HS2 such as investment in broadband . video-conferencing or investment in alternative, more local train . routes. 'It is nonsense . that the DfT does not have a full understanding of the wider economic . impact and regeneration benefits of transport infrastructure, including . HS1, to inform future investment decisions. Go-ahead: Transport Secretary Justine Greening visits St Pancras Station in January to give the green light to the controversial HS2 high-speed rail project . HS2 protest: A sign marks the spot in the Staffordshire village of Middleton where a new rail bridge is proposed to be built . 'All these things are crucial for proving the case for investment in long-distance travel and demonstrating value for money. 'The department must revisit its assumptions on HS2 and develop a full understanding of the benefits and costs of high-speed travel compared to the alternatives.' A DfT spokesman said: 'As this report recognises, HS1 is a successful and central part of our transport infrastructure, carrying millions of passengers a year from a regenerated St Pancras (station in London) to the east of England and the continent. 'It was delivered on time and on budget and this report commends the ""exemplary"" way the sale of the line was handled - generating more than £2billion for the taxpayer, far exceeding market expectations.' The spokesman added: 'Our passenger forecast modelling has improved significantly since the original work for HS1 over 20 years ago, with better understanding of what drives passenger demand, better computer modelling and more computer power to do it. 'Network Rail predicts the West Coast Main Line will be full by the mid-2020s and HS2 presents the most effective solution to this looming capacity crunch facing our rail network. This is in addition to the jobs, regional regeneration and improved connectivity the project will deliver.' Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'We have long been concerned about the vast cost and poor value for taxpayers’ money offered by the Government’s HS2 project and this report only underlines our worries. 'The committee has exposed how inaccurate passenger forecasts for HS1 are costing the taxpayer billions and there remains a real of danger of history repeating itself with HS2.' He went on: 'DfT case for HS2 is based on a number of flawed assumptions, including a new set of unrealistic passenger forecasts, but ministers are preparing to spend £32billion on what risks being a humongous white elephant. 'There are higher priorities than a train line that will only benefit a fortunate minority, while costing well over £1,000 for every family in Britain. 'It would be a dereliction of duty of the part of the Government if it does not follow the committee’s advice and conduct a thorough cost benefit analysis of HS2 before another single penny of taxpayers’ money is spent on the project.'","'Unrealistic estimates' for London to Folkestone HS1 link must not be repeated when business case is made for proposed London to Birmingham HS2 high-speed line, report by MPs says .

"The legal team of a man arrested after kicking a stray cat 20ft through the air in a brutal online video has asked the judge to throw the case out - arguing there is no proof the animal was injured. The horrific footage, which was shot in May and posted to Facebook, shows New Yorker Andre Robinson, 22, pet the trusting animal before punting it into some bushes outside a Brooklyn housing complex. The man then laughs and a little dance. But Robinson, who reportedly has eight priors, was later arrested and charged with aggravated animal cruelty. The legal team of Andre Robinson, who was arrested after kicking a stray cat 20ft through the air in a brutal online video, has asked the judge to throw the case out - arguing there is no proof the animal was injured . Brutal:  Robinson, uses his right foot to boot the cat into the bushes outside the Brooklyn apartment block . The motion to dismiss argues that prosecutors never claimed that the animal suffered any ill effects from the attack. According to the New York Daily News, defence lawyer Risa Procton wrote: 'The accusatory instrument fails to allege any injury or pain experienced by the cat.' Stephen Flamhaft, a defense lawyer who’s not involved in the case, says the motion will most likely be denied, saying: 'How would you expect a cat to reveal injuries?' Robinson faces up to a year in jail if convicted of torturing and injuring animals. A judge will rule on Ms Procton's motion in January. 'It was just a spur of the moment, it just happened,' Robinson has since said. 'I shouldn't have done it.' The kitten, King, was captured three days after the alleged attack, treated at an ASPCA hospital and then adopted. Robinson's arrest was a result, at least in part, of enraged animal lovers using the power of social media to track down a suspect. 'We were able to identify him as part of an investigation behind the video,' an NYPD source told the New York Post. 'People who saw were really disturbed by it.' One of the first steps was identifying the area where of New York where the attack occurred. One Facebook user used video enhancing software to blow up the scene and see details that later led police to identify the scene of the crime as the Brevoort Houses in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Residents of the housing complex told police the stray cat was a fixture in the area.","Andre Robinson's lawyers say prosecutors have not claimed cat was hurt .

"Stephanie Sanpher died of meningitis in February four days after being taken into hospital following a two-hour delay by ambulance staff . A paramedic stopped to have a cigarette before arranging for an ambulance to take a dying teenager to hospital. The unnamed crew member arrived in a rapid response vehicle to treat Stephanie Sanpher, 13, after she collapsed at home. He wrongly assumed she was just upset after an argument at school, despite her mother Joanne pointing out red marks on her body – a classic sign of meningitis. The paramedic then calmly smoked a cigarette in front of the Miss Sanpher, 37, before finally calling an ambulance – 41 minutes after he arrived. It then took a further 29 minutes for the ambulance to reach the house. Stephanie went into cardiac arrest shortly after arriving at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, and died four days later. A post-mortem examination revealed she had died from complications caused by acute meningococcal disease. Miss Sanpher yesterday said she had asked East of England Ambulance Service NHS Trust to take the paramedic off duty after her daughter’s death, but was told he had done everything necessary to treat ‘anxiety’. Describing the paramedic’s visit, she said he had checked Stephanie upstairs before coming into the living room. ‘He obviously saw my e-cigarette on the side,’ she said. ‘He sparked up a fag, asked to use my landline and leant out of the window and dialled my GP. ‘He was more interested in telling me that she was putting this on and wanted attention rather than actually treating her.’ Miss Sanpher, who also has an 11-year-old son, said the paramedic simply told her to ‘cover up’ the lesions on her daughter’s body, before showing her photos of his own children. The single mother had rung 999 at 12.07pm on January 31 after her daughter collapsed at home in Dersingham, Norfolk, an inquest heard this week. Stephanie was off school after the red marks appeared on her body and she complained of a sore throat. The paramedic arrived at 12.11pm and was told about a dispute she had had with another pupil. The teenager, who was epileptic, had suffered a seizure but was conscious and the inquest heard she was not showing typical meningitis symptoms. Nonetheless, the delays meant she did not reach hospital until 1.31pm. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she had to be resuscitated following a heart attack. She was moved to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge where she suffered another heart attack and died on February 4. Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a verdict of death by natural causes on Monday. She also recommended that all response crews working for the trust carry equipment to test for meningitis and have refresher courses on the disease. A spokesman for the trust said it was looking into the recommendations, adding that the paramedic ‘has been subject to disciplinary proceedings and supportive learning’. He also said it is ‘against policy’ for staff to smoke while attending a patient. Norfolk coroner Jacqueline Lake has ordered the East of England Ambulance Service to improve meningitis training for all staff, after a paramedic dismissed Stephanie's symptoms as 'mundane' Stephanie died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. She had been transferred there from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn,  where she had suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after being admitted .","Stephanie Sanpher died from acute meningococcal septicemia .

"No sooner had the last of the poppies been planted than they were set to be packed away. At 9am today, less than 24 hours after the war dead were remembered on the 11th hour of the 11th day on the 11th month, thousands of volunteers will begin to dismantle the poignant tribute. The Tower of London poppies – which touched the hearts of millions who came to honour Britain’s First World War dead - will all be gone by the end of the month. 888,246 poppies have been planted in the dry 16-acre moat around the Tower of London. At 9am today, less than 24 hours after the war dead were remembered, volunteers will begin to dismantle the poignant tribute . This morning the first of 8,000 volunteers are set to move into the moat and begin packaging each of the 888,246 poppies into boxes. They will then be transported offsite, where they will be cleaned before being sent on to those who bought them across the country. Following a Daily Mail campaign to extend the tribute, David Cameron announced one segment of the art installation will stay for longer than originally planned. One of the sculptural sections of the memorial will remain at the Tower for an extra two and a half weeks until the end of November so more people have a chance to see it. This will be The Wave – which rises over the causeway used by visitors to enter the castle. The Weeping Window, which is made up of thousands of poppies cascading out of the Tower’s window, will be removed in the next few days once the poppies surrounding it are gone. This morning the first of 8,000 volunteers are set to move into the moat and begin packaging each of the 888,246 poppies into boxes . The poppies will then be transported offsite, where they will be cleaned before being sent on to those who bought them across the country . It is likely to go into storage until the end of November, when it will then tour the country along with The Wave for four years. Both of them will then be permanently installed at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester. Not a single poppy representing each British and colonial death during the war will remain after November. An estimated five million people have visited the artwork entitled Blood-Swept Lands and Seas of Red by ceramic artist Paul Cummins, from Derbyshire. The poppies were so popular that all 888,246 of them were sold in advance for £25 each. Following a Daily Mail campaign to extend the tribute, David Cameron announced one segment of the art installation will stay for longer than originally planned . The Royal British Legion said it hopes the sale of the poppies will raise in excess of £15m. Ten per cent of every poppy sold will be shared between six service charities, including Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion. The first ceramic poppy was planted in the Tower moat on July 17 and over the past few weeks some 50 poppies crammed into every square metre. Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which operates the landmark, said the process of packing up the poppies will take between ten to 14 days. It is understood each volunteer will be given a three-hour slot to package up the poppies. The tour of the poppies is being supported by donations from two charities, the Backstage Trust and the Clore Duffield Foundation, together with government funding. Thousands of poppies included in the two sculptural sections of the memorial have been bought by the charities – and therefore all members of the public who have pre-purchased there poppies will receive them as planned. The poppies are expected to be delivered to their owners by January. More than £500,000 is being paid by the government to cover the cost of storing, transporting and installing the poppy sculptures in towns and cities across the UK. The funding will come from fines accrued from the Libor banking scandal.","At 9am today volunteers will begin to dismantle the poignant tribute .

"Public schoolboy: Greg Cox, who runs a firm offering loans to customers with poor credit ratings, spends much of his time flying round the world for pleasure or marketing conferences . A millionaire former public school boy is to stand trial in Australia for the alleged rape of a young woman on Bondi Beach. Entrepreneur Greg Cox, 32, is accused of sexually assaulting a 21-year-old woman from Bermuda at a fashionable bar on the beach in January. Cox, from Battersea, South London, has never denied having sex with the woman but always insisted it was consensual. Appearing in court in September, his lawyers unsuccessfully applied for an injunction to keep his name out of the media on account of his privileged background and successful career. They argued that the fact that he comes from a well-known family and attended an elite boarding school - Millfield near Glastonbury, Somerset - coupled with his high standing in the British business community, he would suffer 'undue embarrassment' as a result of the charges. At today's committal hearing, convened to decide whether there is enough evidence to take the case to trial, Mr Cox's barrister,  Graham Turnbull, said there were . 'inconsistencies' in  versions of events his alleged victim had given to police. He claimed that, under cross-examination her allegations would unravel and there was a . reasonable chance the  charge against Mr Cox would be dismissed. Nevertheless, Magistrate Greg Walsh ruled the 'Crown case is not without strength' and Mr Cox's chance of a fair trial would not be prejudiced. The businessman – who runs a firm offering loans to customers with poor credit ratings – spends much of his time flying round the world for pleasure or marketing conferences. Among his Facebook friends he lists 'It girl' Peaches Geldof. Fashionable: Cox is said to have met the woman he is accused of raping at the Bucket List nightclub close to Bondi . Sun, sea, sand... Cox is accused of raping a 21-year-old woman on Bondi Beach after meeting her at a Bondi night club . In recent years he has been a director of a number of companies and was living in a £1million flat in Battersea, South London. Cox is accused of raping a 21-year-old woman on Bondi Beach after meeting her at a Bondi night club. Society friends: Among Cox's Facebook friends he lists 'It girl' Peaches Geldof, pictured at a red carpet event in London earlier last month . He is said to have met the woman he is accused of raping at the Bucket List nightclub close to Bondi. The assault is alleged to have occurred on January 22 between 11.10pm and 11.30pm. Cox has denied the allegations against him. According to Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph, Cox has been staying at a luxury beachside apartment in the suburb of Bronte, a few miles from Bondi. He is said to have been snorkelling at . Hamilton Island, off the Queensland Coast, and attended a surfing event . in the Sydney suburb of Manly. His lawyers today made an application to amend his bail conditions to allow him to return to Britain to look after his business interests. But the magistrate ruled that it would be a matter for the District Court to decide if Mr Cox should be allowed to return home before the trial, which is unlikely to be held before May. On the Quintessential company’s website, he is described as an entrepreneur with more than 12 years’ experience running his own company ‘from start-up to £40million turnover’. It said Cox and a colleague were in Sydney to attend a digital marketing conference being held at Darling Harbour last January. His goals, Cox says on a personal website page, are 'very simple – be the best at what I do'. He also has a London-based company called Cloud9 Media. His Quintessential Finance company lays heavy emphasis on socialising with its business partners, issuing invitations to a party in Las Vegas and posting tweets in anticipation of a night out in New York.

"David Moyes will take charge of his first training session with Real Sociedad on Wednesday before being officially presented as the Spanish side's new coach. Moyes was named as the next Sociedad boss late on Monday night - seven months after he was sacked as Manchester United manager. The Scot, who was axed by United in April following a dismal first season in charge at Old Trafford, has been handed a one-and-a-half-year deal with the Primera Division outfit and is due to land in Spain later on Tuesday. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Cahill's show of support for David Moyes . David Moyes will take his first Real Sociedad training session this week after becoming their new boss .

Saturday November 22 - Deportivo La Coruna (A) (17th in La Liga) Sunday November 30 - Elche (H) (18th in La Liga) Thursday December 4 - Real Oviedo (A) (3rd in Segunda B) Sunday December 7 - Villarreal (A) (8th in La Liga) Sunday December 14 - Athletic Bilbao (H) (11th in La Liga) A Sociedad statement read: 'The new Real Sociedad coach David Moyes will arrive in San Sebastian mid-afternoon, as such it will be the coaches of Sanse (Sociedad's B team) Asier Santana and Imanol Alguacil who will be in charge of the first team for this afternoon's training session. 'David Moyes will take training tomorrow [Wednesday] and then will be officially presented. Full details will be announced later in the day.' Moyes, whose contract with Sociedad runs until June 30, 2016, left United just 10 months into a six-year contract after being named as the successor to Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer of 2013. At the time of his departure, United, the defending champions, were seventh in the Barclays Premier League and 23 points behind leaders Liverpool. Moyes also left the 20-time title winners with a host of unwanted records broken during his tenure, including failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in almost two decades. Sociedad also put up this welcome banner to Moyes on their Twitter page on Monday evening . Moyes will stand in the dugout at the impressive Anoeta Stadium in San Sebastian where Sociedad play .

Moyes, who became the third shortest-serving manager in the club's history, won 27, drew nine and lost 15 of his 51 games in charge of United. All that came after Moyes had enjoyed 11 critically acclaimed years at Everton, leading the club to five top-six finishes. The Toffees qualified for the Champions League for the first time under Moyes' stewardship - although they lost in the qualifying stages of the competition - and he also took the Merseyside club to the FA Cup final in 2009. The former Preston boss takes over a Sociedad side who moved out of the Primera Division relegation zone on Sunday night with a 2-1 home win over champions Atletico Madrid. B team coach Santana was in charge for that match following last week's sacking of Jagoba Arrasate. Former West Brom manager Pepe Mel was also in the running for the position in Spain . Sociedad's home ground, the Anoeta Stadium, during an evening match against Real Madrid in August . Wales boss Chris Coleman was the last British manager to have been in charge of Real Sociedad . Arrasate was dismissed in the wake of a hugely disappointing start to the campaign which saw Sociedad - who finished fourth in 2013 and seventh last term - win just one of their opening 10 league fixtures as well as being eliminated from the Europa League. Ex-West Brom and Real Betis boss Pepe Mel was also in the running to replace Arrasate, but Moyes was reportedly Sociedad's first choice and La Real confirmed the Scot's appointment late on Monday night. Moyes' first game in charge is set to be the trip to promoted Deportivo La Coruna after the international break. Moyes becomes the fourth British manager of the San Sebastian-based outfit, following in the footsteps of Englishman Harry Lowe and Welsh duo John Toshack and Chris Coleman. VIDEO Moyes returns to management . While in charge at Manchester United last season, Moyes twice faced Sociedad in the Champions League - winning at home and drawing away. Manchester United 1-0 Real Sociedad (October 24, 2013) An own goal from Ingo Martinez just two minutes into this Champions League tie at Old Trafford gave United a deserved victory - although they could and should have won by more.

"He just turned 65-years-old in October. But Bruce Jenner is showing no signs of slowing down. In fact, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is speeding up his life by entering the dangerous five-day Baja 1000 race with his lesser-known son Burt, according to TMZ. The competition, which begins Wednesday, has seen several drivers die in the past few years due to high speeds and challenging conditions on the off road course through the Mexican desert.

The E! star will have to do a fair share of the driving himself. His son will take on the first 400 miles and the former Olympian will do the next segment. But he will hand over the keys again to Burt for the big finish. Last year 30-year-old X Games star Kurt Caselli was killed during the competition. Several drivers, and even spectators, have died during the race. It's official: Both Bruce and Burt, along with Craig Potts, have their name on the poster for the event which will take place from November 12 to 16 . Like big kids during Christmas: The father and son duo posing with a toy car in the spring . This is an odd choice for Jenner, who has been seen in recent months with a more feminine body, longer hair and manicured nails. But it may be a way for him to get closer to his son Burt, who he had with his first wife Chrystie Crownover (they were man and wife from 1972 to 1981). They also had a child named Casey. Bruce had Brody and Brandon with wife Linda Thompson (they were wed from 1981 to 1985), and daughters Kendall and Kylie with Kris (who he married in 1991 but split from in 2013).

"Something strange is happening on comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko 67P as space engineers prepare for a historic landing: the icy space rock is 'singing'. The mysterious sound has baffled scientists, who recorded it using a Rosetta instrument originally designed to analyse the comet's magnetic field. Instead, this instrument picked up a strange bubbling sound which scientists believe was created by a stream of electrically-charged particles. Scroll down for video and audio . Something strange is happening on comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko 67P as space engineers prepare for a historic landing: the icy space rock is 'singing' 'This is exciting because it is completely new to us,' said Karl-Heinz Glaßmeier, principal investigator with Rosetta's Plasma Consortium. 'We did not expect this and we are still working to understand the physics of what is happening.' The comet is 'singing' at 40-50 millihertz, but the human ear only picks up sound between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Because the original audio is below the threshold of human hearing, Professor Glaßmeier has created a recording with the pitch magnified a thousand times. Click below to play the audio . Rosetta will release Philae at 08:35 GMT/09:35 CET on 12 November at a distance. Pictured is an artist's impression of the lander on Comet 67P . Rosetta will release Philae at 08:35 GMT/09:35 CET on 12 November at a distance of  14 miles (22.5km) from the centre of the comet. The landing will be about seven hours later at around 15:30 GMT/16:30 CET. During the descent, Philae will take images and conduct science experiments, sampling the dust, gas and plasma environment close to the comet. It will take a 'farewell' image of the Rosetta orbiter shortly after separation, along with a number of images as it approaches the comet surface. It is expected that the first images from this sequence will be received on Earth several hours after separation. Once safely on the surface, Philae will take a panorama of its surroundings. Again, this is expected back on Earth several hours later. The first sequence of surface science experiments will begin about an hour after touchdown and will last for 64 hours, constrained by the lander's primary battery lifetime. Longer-term study of the comet by Philae will depend on for how long and how well the batteries are able to recharge, which is related to the amount of dust that settles on its solar panels. It is expected that by March 2015, as the comet moves closer in its orbit towards the sun, temperatures inside the lander will have reached levels too high to continue operations, and Philae's science mission will come to an end. But the Rosetta orbiter's mission will continue for much longer. It will accompany the comet as it grows in activity until their closest approach to the sun in August 2015 and then as they head back towards the outer solar system. The music was heard clearly by the magnetometer experiment for the first time in August, when Rosetta drew to within 60 miles (100 km) of 67P. Scientists think it must be produced in some way by the activity of the comet, as it releases neutral particles into space where they become electrically charged due to a process called ionisation. While the precise physical process behind the oscillations remains a mystery, flight engineers hope it might prove useful in guiding the descent of the Philae lander tomorrow morning. This is the first time in history that anyone has attempted to land on a comet, and scientists hope the data will help them unravel how the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago. Tomorrow morning, tensions at Rosetta mission control (pictured) in Darmstadt Germany will be running high as space engineers attempt to land Philae onto the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko . The comet is named after astronomers Klim Ivanovych Churyumov and Svetlana Ivanovna Gerasimenko who identified it in 1969. It is believed to originate from the Kuiper Belt, a large reservoir of small icy bodies located just beyond Neptune. Scientists describe it as a 'Jupiter class' comet which takes 6.45 years to complete one full circuit of the sun . The icy core, or nucleus, is about 2.4 miles (4km) across  and the comet takes around 12.4 hours to rotate fully. The comet has now been observed from Earth on seven approaches to the Sun: in 1969, 1976, 1982, 1989, 1996, 2002 and 2009. Over an entire year, as it approaches the sun, Rosetta will orbit the comet, mapping its surface and studying changes in its activity. As its ices evaporate, instruments on board the orbiter will study the dust and gas particles that surround the comet and trail behind it . The comet is currently 300 million miles away (480 million km), and is travelling through space at about 34,000 mph (55,000 km/h). Rosetta has chased 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P. When it was launched in 2004, Rosetta was so far from 67P that it had to pass Earth three times and Mars once, so that it could use the planets' gravity to slingshot its way deep into the solar system. At 08.35 GMT tomorrow, mission control in Darmstadt, Germany will send a command to release the Philae probe from Rosetta's grip. The probe will then be in free fall for seven hours, before landing on the icy surface of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. If all goes to plan, Philae should send a signal back to mission control engineers at around 4pm GMT. The Philae probe aims to analyse the comet in more detail than Rosetta could. The results, Esa claims, could completely rewrite the history of how the Earth formed. The daring descent Philae  (artist's impression shown) will take seven hours from separation. It will be exactly nine years that a similar landing attempt on an asteroid by Japan's Hayabusa failed in 2005 .","Song recorded on instrument designed to analyse 67P's magnetic field .

"Ground zero in the nation's fight against cybercrime hides in plain sight, in a nondescript suburban office building with no government seals or signs. Only after passing a low-key receptionist stationed on the seventh floor does one see the metal detectors, personal cellphone lockers and a series of heavy doors marked 'classified' - all leading to the auditorium-sized National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center. Inside, around-the-clock, close to 100 specialists monitor floor-to-ceiling maps of the U.S. and world, along with streams of data and breaking news. States are color-coded from green to red, for a low threat of attack to severe.

"A family of six children who were torn apart by the death of their mother following a devastating house fire where they lost everything finally have something to smile about. Larissa Monahan, 21, and her five brothers live separately since their mother, Marelle, lost her battle with pancreatic cancer last year. Her death meant Ms Monahan now has to care for her 12-year-old brother, Siauosi, and the rest of brothers live with two different grandparents in Penrith - west of Sydney in New South Wales - and New Zealand. The 21-year-old's other brothers are 22-year-old Lachlan, 17-year-old Keenann and 15-year-old Solomon. Scroll down for video . The Monahan family, seen here at Christmas in 2010, lost their family home to a fire in 2011 before their mum Marelle lost her battle with pancreatic cancer last year . Recently, the family were selected by Fiji Airways to take part in their Welcome To Our Home campaign to showcase the warm nature of Fijian hospitality, offering them their first trip overseas together. Ms Monahan said she was grateful for the opportunity as they would not be able to afford a holiday like that for at least 10 years. 'It was just amazing to spend some quality time with each other that was uninterrupted because we only seen each other once since my mother passed,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was nice to be with the boys…and to have quality time. The family, here with mum Marelle (centre) at her 40th birthday in 2011, were split up after their mother's death . Larissa (centre holding a younger family member) now cares for her younger brother Siauosi, 12, . 'The opportunity was astounding I've never expected anyone to do that for us, you just do not expect for people to do that.' Ms Monahan said it had been very tough since her mother's death because she was their role model. 'She was all of our best friend basically. She taught us to be who were and to be who we wanted to be and not let anything to stand in our way of what we truly wanted,' she said. 'It formed us into individual people rather than worry about what people would say... and love ourselves for who we are.' But losing their mother to cancer is not the only hardship they have faced in the past few years. The six siblings Larissa, Lachlan, Keennan, Solomon (not pictured) and Siauosi were recently reunited in Fiji thanks to Fiji Airways  Welcome To Our Home campaign . It was the second time the siblings had seen each other since the death of Marelle (centre) last year, pictured here in 2013 . In 2011, the family lost everything in a house fire - just one street away from where she lives now in Penrith - while Ms Monahan's mother and three brothers were asleep inside. 'I had gone down to the shops and came back 15 minutes later and the roof and garage was on fire,' Ms Monahan said. 'The garage was converted into a room for Solomon and it started in that garage. 'My first thought was he was in there. I didn't get the keys out or anything, I just started banging on the door... I just couldn't think. 'My first and only thought was Solomon was in there and I needed to get him out.

"With 64 bedrooms, it has enough room for all your in-laws, fifth cousins and great-aunts. If you think you'd survive that Christmas do,  Hawkstone Hall can be yours for just £4.25million - excluding the heating bill. The Georgian stately home near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, which hosted the writer of the first English dictionary Samuel Johnson and Waterloo reunion dinners for the Duke of Wellington, is on the market after 90 years in the hands of Catholic missionaries. Lavish: Grade I listed Hawkstone Hall near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, hosted writer Samuel Johnson and Waterloo reunion dinners for the Duke of Wellington. It has remained on the market for more than two years and it price has been slashed from £5m to £4.25m . Sprawling: The house and its former service wing have a staggering 64 bedrooms - 50 of them single rooms for Catholic missionaries . It originally went on the market for £5million in June 2012, but has remained unsold for more than two years. Now the estate agents - who admit there's renovation work to be done to turn it back into a private home - have been forced to slash the price to £4.25million. The Hall's bedroom count is thanks to the fact the Catholic order, the Redemptorists, replaced the north-east service wing with 50 single rooms for its members in 1962. But the history of the estate itself dates back as far as 1556, and over the years it has been owned by prominent figures and members of Parliament. The main home, a Grade I listed Georgian mansion in the style of French King Louis XIV, was built around 1700 and has more than 20,000 square feet of living space including a ballroom, Venetian saloon, numerous reception rooms and 14 bedrooms. Heritage: The house was visited by writer Dr Samuel Johnson, who wrote of the estate's 'shades, precipices, hollows and lofty rocks' Enough room for you? The house has enough space to host an entire extended family for Christmas - and take them to church . Its visitors included Dr Johnson, who wrote how he was captivated by the estate in 1774. 'By the extent of its prospects,' he wrote, ' the awfulness of its shades, the horrors of its precipices, the verdure of its hollows, and the loftiness of its rocks, the ideas which it forces upon the mind are the sublime, the dreadful and the vast.' The ballroom was built for £2,400 for owner Sir Rowland Hill in 1832 and was the setting of many lavish dinners. He became the first Viscount Hill after rising to prominence in the Napoleonic wars as a trusted general, eventually serving as the Duke of Wellington's second in command at the Battle of Waterloo. For many years the family toast was: 'May the Hills of Shropshire last as long as the Shropshire hills'. But the estate - with expanded hugely with an ornamental lake and Gothic arch - fell into decline in a familiar tale of the over-exuberance of the landed gentry. Liberal MP George Whiteley bought the house and made several additions, including an indoor swimming pool, before the entire estate as it was then was broken up after the First World War. The bulk of it was sold to local farmers and turned into a hotel but the grand Hawkstone Hall remained, and was sold to the Redemptorists in 1926. From there its story was a little more prosaic. Scandal-ridden Tory minister John Profumo enjoyed his liaisons with Christine Keeler in a cottage in the grounds, before the estate was used to film a BBC Chronicles of Narnia series in the 1980s. In recent years, Hawkstone Hall has been run as a retreat for people in the Catholic ministry, but the trustees decided to sell the estate with the aim of turning it back into a private home for the super-rich. In London the £4.25million price buys a far more humble three-bedroom terraced house in Queen's Gate Mews, South Kensington - or a mere two-bedroom flat in Drayton Court, Chelsea. And it works out at around £97 per square foot - one-eightieth of the price of a property in One Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, one of the most expensive places to live in the world. As a bonus, the buyer gets 88 acres of land which still remain attached to the hall and another two houses and a church in the grounds. Grand: The estate agents selling the home, which went on the market in 2012, admit there is probably some work to be done on it . Pilgrimage: The home is visited by members of the Redemptorists Catholic order from all over the world, and they leave their mark . Father Maurice O’Mahony, who is leaving after 12 and a half years in the house, said: 'It is a very private place – we are a mile off the main road – and also very peaceful. 'Men and women of great integrity and goodness have come here from across the world. They have left their footprint on this house - a rare quality in any property. 'We look out over the Welsh hills and every day the view is different because of the changing skies and seasons. You get the most amazing sunsets.' Mike Artham, managing director of estate agents Barbers and Reeves and Partners, said: 'Hawkstone is simply stunning. It is a wonderful, very stylish building in a beautiful setting.' 'During the ownership of the Hills, it became a private house with a national reputation and is known internationally because of its most recent use.' 'Of course, after more than eight decades of occupation by the congregation, there is conversion work to be done, but what a project.' 'The current owners added an accommodation block in the 1960s and I am sure that any purchaser wishing to remove it would be pushing on an open door with conservationists.' 'It is rare to deal with a property which has had so few owners down the centuries and it does bring us a sense of responsibility.' 'You get a lot for the price, particularly when you compare it to parts of London where the same amount of money may only buy you a small flat.' Secluded: Current resident Father Maurice O’Mahony said he would miss being a mile from the main road - and the 'amazing sunsets'","Lavish Hawkstone Hall near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was built in around 1700 but remains unsold for two years .

"Kelly Billen was branded a 'manipulative deviant' after she ransacked the home of her  neighbour, 94, and stole £20,000 worth of his premium bonds . A woman spent four days ransacking the home of her elderly neighbour, ripping up floorboards to steal his valuables and eventually cashing in his life savings of almost £20,000. Kelly Billen, 35, devastated the home of 94-year-old Richard Jones near Aberdare in south Wales, overturning furniture and lifting attic insulation to find anything she could possibly steal. The pensioner had been away for just four days when his niece went to check on the house and found all the rooms had been searched, furniture overturned and the house plundered. It emerged Billen had raided the house, eventually finding paperwork for Mr Jones' life savings in premium bonds for £19,426 which she managed to cash in. However she was caught after she left a footprint at the scene, traced back to one of her trainers. Police have branded Billen, who used to work in a care home, a 'manipulative deviant.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Jones’s niece visited his home to check on the property and left in “disbelief because there was such a mess”. Mr Jones has dementia and is now living in a care home, unaware of what happened at his home. Ian Kolvin, prosecuting Billen, said: 'The house was ransacked. All the rooms had been searched. 'All the property had been turned upside down and even the insulation in the attic had been pulled up.' However Billen was tracked down after she left a footprint at the scene in Hirwaun and was identified by tests on her Nike trainer. Mr Jones's financial documents were found in her shed. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard she tried to register for online banking at Nationwide and the Principality building society to access his accounts. She also tried to cash a £1,100 cheque at Lloyds but was turned away. Lucy Crowther, defending, said Billen had been a care worker but had increasing debts after turning to amphetamines. At a hearing at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court Billen was jailed for three years and three months for burglary . Billen was jailed for three years and three months after admitting burglary and eight counts of fraud. Recorder Richard Booth QC said: 'When you got hold of the documents you got busy with a view of obtaining money for drugs.' Detective Constable Gareth Millard later said: 'This was a callous and calculated crime which could very easily have drained this innocent, vulnerable man of his life savings. 'She deserves her time in prison and for people to know exactly what a manipulative deviant she is.'","Woman ransacked home of elderly neighbour in Hirwaun, South Wales .

"This is the horrifying moment a woman was sent flying through the air after she was struck by a car at the Abbey Road crossing - the site famously used by the Beatles for the cover of their eleventh studio album. The video, captured on a webcam installed outside the historic Abbey Road Studios, shows the unnamed female running across the famous street. The car, believed to be a Volkswagen Gold Golf, then hits the woman on the front driver's wing, causing an audible crunch before throwing her several feet across the road. The pedestrian, pictured in black, begins crossing the road despite the short gap between passing traffic . The hatchback reaches the crossing just as the woman, wearing a black coat, makes it to the halfway point . The woman appears to notice that she is going to be struck by the car and attempts to avoid being hit .

The photograph gave the north London crossing a legendary status and turned it into a tourist attraction . As the car drives out of range of the camera - which is owned by the nearby Abbey Road Studios and used to capture visitors' Beatles parodies - concerned pedestrians and cyclists rushed to the stricken woman's aid. A passer-by wearing a pink shirt is seen repeatedly shouting 'somebody call an ambulance' as he attended to the injured woman. Despite many thinking the driver of the vehicle fled the scene, according to staff at the recording studio, they pulled over to help. A spokesperson said: 'Our security team recognised it as an incident which occurred over a year ago. 'The motorist concerned did actually stop at the scene to offer assistance.' The incident occurred about 5.58pm on July 3, 2012, a London Ambulance Service spokesperson said. 'We sent an ambulance crew and a responder by car to the scene. We treated the woman for a head injury and she was taken to St Mary's Hospital.' The motorist connects with her on the right of their vehicle, causing an audible crunching sound . The impact of the sickening collision then spins her head over heels into the air . She is sent airborne, narrowly avoiding a vehicle passing in the opposite direction .

"Ministers were warned they face a legal challenge over Britain’s membership of the European Arrest Warrant last night as bitter recriminations flew about the ‘shambolic’ Commons vote on the issue. Eurosceptic Tory MPs variously blamed David Cameron, Theresa May, Michael Gove and William Hague for the chaotic scenes that unfolded as a package of EU crime and justice measures was approved. Senior Tories also turned their fire on Commons Speaker John Bercow, accusing him of siding with Labour to deliberately inflame the row. MPs now plan to try to oust Mr Bercow next May and replace him with his popular Labour deputy, Lindsay Hoyle. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Speaker John Bercow accused ministers of behaving ‘contemptuously’ in the Commons on Monday . The Speaker triggered uproar in the Commons on Monday night by accusing ministers of behaving ‘contemptuously’ and presiding over a ‘sorry saga’ by not offering a specific vote on the arrest warrant. Instead, the Government sought specific approval to rejoin the 11 measures not yet in British law, but made clear a vote against would mean the entire package, including the arrest warrant, not being implemented. In the event, the Government won by 464 to 38, a majority of 426. But former Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler last night announced he is to seek a High Court injunction against Britain opting back into the warrant. Mr Wheeler said his opposition to the warrant was being backed by Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg to spearhead wider opposition to the warrant. He claimed rejoining the arrest warrant ‘will largely make Magna Carta, which has been a big source of liberty for the individual in this country for nearly 800 years, irrelevant’. Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox said Mr Bercow had gone ‘over the top’ in triggering the furore. But he acknowledged: ‘I think it would have been better for all concerned if the Government had simply put down an adjournment motion and debated the European arrest warrant in itself.’ Ministers were ‘technically correct’ that a motion including the warrant would have been meaningless, since the measure is already on the statute book. Former Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler (pictured) plans to seek a High Court injunction against Britain opting back into the warrant. He said his opposition to the warrant was being backed by Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg . But he added: ‘I think the House was angry because the House wanted a specific debate on a specific issue.’ Former Home Office minister Damian Green said it had ‘not been a triumph of Parliamentary handling’, but raised questions about Mr Bercow’s conduct. ‘The danger is if he appears to be just against this executive – just against this government,’ he said. Labour said it would give MPs another vote on the arrest warrant next week – the day before the by-election in Rochester and Strood. But the debate will be symbolic since the outcome of a vote will not be binding on the Government. Downing Street said last night: ‘We were very clear. ‘There was an opportunity for MPs if they did not support the package of 35 measures, then the UK would have come out of all of them.’","Former Ukip treasurer Stuart Wheeler plans to seek High Court injunction .

"It has baffled astronomers for years - just what causes the 'red spot' on the surface of Jupiter? Now they have an unlikely answer - sunburn. Nasa experts believe it is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere. Experts believe the 'spot' is a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere. In the lab, the researchers blasted ammonia and acetylene gases - chemicals known to exist on Jupiter - with ultraviolet light, to simulate the sun's effects on these materials at the extreme heights of clouds in the Great Red Spot. This produced a reddish material, which the team compared to the Great Red Spot as observed by Cassini's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). The results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot's striking color - that the reddish chemicals come from beneath Jupiter's clouds. 'Our models suggest most of the Great Red Spot is actually pretty bland in color, beneath the upper cloud layer of reddish material,' said Kevin Baines, a Cassini team scientist based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. 'Under the reddish 'sunburn' the clouds are probably whitish or grayish.' Baines and JPL colleagues Bob Carlson and Tom Momary arrived at their conclusions using a combination of data from Cassini's December 2000 Jupiter flyby and laboratory experiments. In the lab, the researchers blasted ammonia and acetylene gases - chemicals known to exist on Jupiter - with ultraviolet light, to simulate the sun's effects on these materials at the extreme heights of clouds in the Great Red Spot. This produced a reddish material, which the team compared to the Great Red Spot as observed by Cassini's Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). They found that the light-scattering properties of their red concoction nicely matched a model of the Great Red Spot in which the red-colored material is confined to the uppermost reaches of the giant cyclone-like feature. A coloring agent confined to the top of the clouds would be inconsistent with the competing theory, which posits that the spot's red color is due to upwelling chemicals formed deep beneath the visible cloud layers, he said. North america superimposed onto the spot, which is as wide as two Earths. The spot is actually a violent storm. The biggest in the solar system, it appears as a deep red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow, orange and white. Winds inside the storm have been measured at several hundreds of miles per hour, Nasa astronomers said. If red material were being transported from below, it should be present at other altitudes as well, which would make the red spot redder still. Jupiter is composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, with just a sprinkling of other elements. Scientists are interested in understanding what combinations of elements are responsible for the hues seen in Jupiter's clouds, as this would provide insights into the giant planet's make-up. Jupiter possesses three main cloud layers, which occupy specific altitudes in its skies; from highest to lowest they are: ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide and water clouds. As for why the intense red color is seen only in the Great Red Spot and a few much smaller spots on the planet, the researchers think altitude plays a key role. 'The Great Red Spot is extremely tall,' Baines said. 'It reaches much higher altitudes than clouds elsewhere on Jupiter.' The team thinks the spot's great heights both enable and enhance the reddening. Its winds transport ammonia ice particles higher into the atmosphere than usual, where they are exposed to much more of the sun's ultraviolet light. In addition, the vortex nature of the spot confines particles, preventing them from escaping. This causes the redness of the spot's cloud tops to increase beyond what might otherwise be expected. Other areas of Jupiter display a mixed palette of oranges, browns and even shades of red. Baines says these are places where high, bright clouds are known to be much thinner, allowing views to depths in the atmosphere where more colorful substances exist.","Colour product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight .

"Minister Matthew Hancock said the Government has plans for a ‘sovereign wealth fund’ to hold the revenues from fracking for the north of England . Fracking for shale gas could prompt a gold rush that will turn northern towns like Blackpool into British equivalents of oil-rich communities in the Middle East, a Cabinet minister has claimed. Business and energy minister Matthew Hancock revealed that the Government is preparing to announce plans for a ‘sovereign wealth fund’ to hold the revenues from fracking for the north of England. Such state-owned funds have been set up in the Middle East and Norway to generate huge sums from the proceeds of oil and gas exploration. They invest in assets such as stocks, property, infrastructure and precious metals, with proceeds able to fund public spending. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to unveil details of a fund in his autumn statement next month. Mr Hancock will also today announce the creation of a new National College for Onshore Oil and Gas, based in Blackpool with offshoots in Chester, Portsmouth, Redcar and Strathclyde. It will train school leavers and graduates in fracking technology, enabling them to win lucrative jobs in the industry. Ministers believe fracking could herald an energy revolution that will boost the economy, make Britain more self-sufficient and bring down sky-high bills from greedy energy firms. The Treasury has offered generous tax breaks to kickstart the technology. Scientists say the UK is potentially sitting on shale deposits filled with enough gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years – a discovery that could see a repeat of the North Sea oil boom. Shale gas development has taken off in the US, using the controversial process of fracking, or hydraulic fracturing. Gas deposits trapped underground are extracted by fracturing shale rock with blasts of water, sand and chemicals. Opponents warn that the technology risks causing small earthquakes, polluting water supplies, blighting the countryside and affecting house prices. Possible sites for the extraction of shale gas have been identified across the north of England, from Morecambe Bay and Cheshire across to North Lincolnshire and Humberside. The Weald Basin and the central belt of Scotland also harbour potentially valuable deposits, experts say. Mr Hancock told the Daily Mail: ‘Fifty years ago there was a debate about whether we get oil out from under the North Sea. Our country would have been much poorer if we had chosen not to do so. ‘Now we need to extract the gas that’s deep beneath the ground to improve our energy security and provide jobs and prosperity. ‘Aberdeen has become a global hub for offshore oil and gas expertise. We want Blackpool to become the hub for expertise in onshore oil and gas. Revenue from fracking could remain in the north. Picutred: A test drilling site for shale gas in Lancashire . ‘We have to make sure that when the revenues flow, we make best use of them. As well as money going directly to local communities and landowners, we are also working on a sovereign wealth fund to make sure the revenues are well spent on behalf of the nation. ‘Lots of different countries have these funds. Norway is the best example and the Shetland Islands also have a fund using some of the oil revenues that they keep. ‘When we extract shale gas, there is the potential for very large returns and we have to ensure they are spent wisely. A sovereign wealth fund would make sure the money is spent for the long-term. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to unveil details of a fund in his autumn statement next month . ‘There is a very good case for it to focus on where the shale flows from, which would make at least part of it a northern fund.’ Mr Hancock said it was estimated that at least £3.5 billion a year in net benefits could flow from shale extraction. ‘One shale pad has the potential to generate between £5 million and £10 million-worth of gas over its lifetime, which is a transformative amount in a local community. ‘The truth is, nobody knows exactly how much is down there or how much we can get out. The way to find out is to get on with it.’ As well as the economic benefits, Mr Hancock suggested it was important to reduce Britain’s dependence on foreign gas. ‘In terms of our energy security, we import eight per cent of our gas from Qatar. We import a small amount from Russia. Domestic gas is a much more secure supply,’ he said. ‘It has been extracted from the North Sea for 50 years, but that’s on a downward trend.’ Despite Mr Hancock’s enthusiasm for the technology, some of the Government’s own energy advisers suggested yesterday that ministers may have overstated the potential of fracking to transform the British economy. Criticising politicians’ ‘premature’ claims, scientists from the UK Energy Research Centre said the need for gas is falling - not growing - and shale can only have a limited role in Britain. Professor Jim Watson, research director of UKERC and an advisor to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), dismissed suggestions of a rapid economic revolution. ‘I think where the Government has gone wrong is talking this whole thing up, in the early days when it first came on the agenda, as if it was going to reduce consumer bills and tackle energy security problems in a substantial way any time soon,’ he said. Dr Christophe McGlade of University College London, an author of a new report on fracking, said: ‘There’s no evidence there will be a huge boom in the UK: absolutely explore, but stop banking on it being plentiful and cheap.’","Minister Matthew Hancock said fracking could transform northern towns .

"Alan Evans, 35, is accused of killing wife Louise, 32, after she found out he was having a fling with a teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick (pictured yesterday) The lover of a husband accused of killing his wife by pushing her down the stairs told a court today that the couple had planned a new life and children of their own. Alan Evans, 35, is accused of killing wife Louise, 32, after she found out he was having an affair with married teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick, 30, who worked at their children’s school. Worcester Crown Court heard the welder had attempted to make his wife’s death look like a tragic accident by placing a skipping rope and a vacuum cleaner next to her body. Today his mistress told the court their affair started when the pair began meeting up to let their children play together or walk dogs. Explicit details of 1,000 text messages between the pair were read to the jury. Ms Chadwick said the relationship had eventually become physical and they would 'sneak off' to hotels to have sex. They also had intercourse in their own marital beds when their partners were away, it was said. Just one month before Evans allegedly murdered his wife at their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, she said the couple had talked of their plans to run away together and have children of their own. She claimed Evans had made fun of his wife’s problems getting pregnant just weeks before she died.She said she had wanted to end her own marriage, adding 'But I wanted to do it the right way, on our terms, to sit them down and tell them. 'Louise called me, she asked me why I there were over 1,000 text messages between me and her husband. 'I didn’t realise there were that many. She asked me why I was texting her husband at certain times of the night. I said it was because he was working. 'I felt stupid and awful, I knew she wasn’t stupid, I knew in the back of her mind she knew. 'I respected her, even though I was having an affair with her husband.' The court heard Mrs Evans had been forced to go through expensive IVF treatment in order to conceive the couple’s twin daughters. Worcester Crown Court heard the welder (pictured here on his wedding day with his wife) had attempted to make her death look like a tragic accident by placing a skipping rope and a vacuum cleaner next to her body . And while reassuring his mistress that he would be able to have more children Evans “took the mickey” out of his wife’s problems, it was said. Ms Chadwick added: 'It was insensitive. If anyone had said it about myself I would be mortified. 'I thought he was taking the mickey out of himself at first - I didn’t think he would ever take the mickey out of her for that.' A jury of six men and six women also heard that the pair had sent each other scheming text messages to try and put Mrs Evans, who had become suspicious, off the scent. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said when Louise discovered her husband had sent over 1,000 text messages to Miss Chadwick she confronted him in a furious telephone call at work. He also read out a series of text messages that Ms Chadwick and Evans had sent to each other to make it seem to Mrs Evans and Ms Chadwick’s husband Simon that it was innocent. The court heard Evans colluded with his mistress (pictured leaving court) to deceive his wife by sending manufactured text messages to each other days before her death . One, sent by Ms Chadwick, read: 'OMG seriously, she must not know me at all if she did she would know I am trying to save my marriage, not have an affair.’ She told the court: 'They were for Simon and Louise. They weren’t true, I still loved him [Evans]. 'We must have talked about making sure that they still didn’t find out.' Earlier messages between the pair were also read to the court showing their desire to run away together. One sent by Ms Chadwick read: 'he he, I am funny, thought it would make you giggle... Never going to split up again, together forever, so lucky to still have you, never felt so hurt before in my life... Let’s not waste time, let’s plan for our lives, somebody up there must know we deserve each other.' Another message from Evans read: 'i just want to show you off to my family. They will love you.'I love you 210 per cent, oh my god I want you so much chick.' Just one month before Evans allegedly murdered his wife (pictured on images from a Facebook account) at their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, she said the couple had talked of their plans to run away together and have children of their own . Louise Evans was described as a loyal friend, a devoted wife and a brilliant mother to her three girls . Mr Hankin then asked her to read out a message she had sent to Evans following that conversation. She said: 'That fat bitch is going to school to complain to Hilary. Said she is going to do what ever it takes for me to lose my job.' Despite the affair Ms Chadwick claimed that she had grown close to Mrs Evans as well, the pair spending time going to the cinema together and going to each other’s homes. Evans denies one count of murder. The trial - which is expected to last another five weeks - continues.

"November - the month moustaches are grown for charity - can cause men all over the world to become strangely attached to their facial hair. But come December these newly-transformed hairy faces will have a big choice to make: to beard or not to beard. Now, to help with this decision, two Canadians at Asap Science have condensed the centuries-long debate into a seven-minute video detailing the science behind the trend. Scroll down for video . Which do you prefer? Bearded men were seen as more dominant and aggressive, according to research. Pictured is David Beckham with stubble (left) and a full-grown beard (right) In the video, Mitchell Moffit and Gregory Brown claim that 60 per cent of verbal communication is affected by a person's facial appearance. A bearded Mr Brown highlights research by college students in which bearded men were seen as more dominant and masculine. He added that a study of managers found that men with long beards are seen as more competent and had better personalities. To which a clean-shaven Mr Moffitt replied: 'Masculinity or being dominate isn't always a good thing, especially in job interviews, because it isn't always about being a leader. It's about being a team player. He continued that a study, albeit funded by Gillette, suggested that HR professionals prefer clean-shaven men. The study of more than 500 HR professionals discovered that 84 per cent agreed that well-groomed employees have higher chances of getting promoted, than those with stubble or beards. In a separate study, psychologists at Northumbria University manipulated men’s facial hair in photographs, giving them varying degrees of facial hair. These images were then rated by 60 women who scored bearded men higher for masculinity, but also aggressiveness. Never mind balding treatments - now there's a 'fertiliser' which promises to boost beard growth. The supplement, called Beardilizer, is aimed at follically-challenged men desperate to grow facial hair but struggling to achieve anything more than stubble. The product claims to promote the growth of facial hair by stimulating follicles, resulting in a thicker, more luscious beard to match those sported by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, David Beckham, Ben Affleck and Superman actor Henry Cavill. It was launched after it became fashionable to have a beard - and it has been such a hit that around 1,000 bottles are apparently flying off the shelves every day. Beardilizer is made from a blend of vitamins and minerals that its makers claim nourish facial hair follicles. Users are recommended a dosage of three capsules a day for between one month and six months. However, when the images were ranked on social status and respect, the bearded men regularly received higher scores than the clean-shaven ones. But could clean-shave men be making a comeback? Earlier this year, a study by scientists in Sydney, Australia, found changes in men's beard fashions may be guided by Darwinian selection. The more beards there are, the less attractive they become, giving clean-shaven men an advantage, according to the scientists at the University of New South Wales. When 'peak beard' frequency is reached, men start reaching for the razors - a trend we many now be experiencing. Whether or not it's still fashionable, Mr Brown says his beard helps save his face from damaging UV rays. This theory, however, has been disproved by research at the University of Southern Queensland on three life-size mannequin heads. Scientists attached a long beard to one, added a short beard to the second, and added minimal facial hair to another. They mounted the dummies upright on a rotating platform exposed to the sun and measured how much UV protection they received. Brad Pitt with a beard, and without. A quick hashtag search of #BILF (which stands for Beard I'd Like to Fondle) brings up more than 16,000 results on Instagram, suggesting that the trend may be around for a while longer . More than half of British women think men with bushy 'hipster' beards (Pierce Brosnan left) are 'sexiest'. Eight out of ten women thought bearded men (Tom Hardy right) looked more masculine, and over two thirds revealed they would prefer to date a man with a beard over one who was clean-shaven . 'Although protection is provided by the facial hair, it is not very high and the presence of facial hair should not be taken as a reason to spend extended periods of time in sunlight,' they said.

"Sportsmail can reveal a further tranche of offensive texts and emails between former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay and club official Iain Moody. In the most disturbing message, Mackay calls Cardiff’s Malaysian owner Vincent Tan a ‘chink’. On another extraordinary day of drama in the wake of Sportsmail’s exclusive revelations, Mackay appeared on TV to deliver a personal apology for his previous abusive texts. As the affair reverberated across football, Cardiff City called for League Managers Association chief executive Richard Bevan to resign after his organisation dismissed Mackay’s behaviour as ‘friendly text message banter’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mackay deny he is racist, homophobic, sexist or anti-Semitic . Offensive: Sportsmail can reveal Malky Mackay called Vincent Tan a 'chink' in a disturbing text exchange . Success: Cardiff owner Tan celebrates Cardiff's Championship title victory with Mackay in 2013 . Both apologies came before Friday's latest incendiary revelations, and the  texts published now raise further questions about how Mackay and the LMA have responded to the furore. The LMA insisted Mackay had sent only two offensive messages, when in fact there were three listed in the two letters sent by Cardiff’s lawyers to the FA in the past eight days. Mackay admitted to three in his interview on Friday night, even though he will be aware that the club is in possession of more. Sportsmail has discovered details of four more messages recovered during Cardiff’s £750,000 investigation into club transfer business, three of which were sent by Mackay and include the offensive reference to Cardiff’s owner. Mackay has already admitted referring to Korea midfielder Kim Bo-kyung and his representatives as ‘fkn chinkys’. Sorry: Malky Mackay made a public apology on Friday following Sportsmail's exclusive revelations . Live: Mackay apologised on Sky Sports and insisted 'they came from a man under pressure rather than a bigot' On June 5 last year, Mackay, then manager of Cardiff, contacted the club’s head of recruitment, Moody, about a player they were trying to sign. A message was sent from Mackay’s phone that read: ‘Not taking no for an answer from the chink until the 20th time or unless somebody big blows us out of the water. Can you tell him that.’ Tan controlled club finances at the time and investigators at Cardiff are understood to be confident it is Tan to whom Mackay refers. A week later came another illuminating exchange, offering what appears to be a startling observation about Mackay. At the time, Mackay was concerned that a player they were pursuing had been linked with a rival club. He relayed his feelings to Moody, who replied: ‘He told me he had an offer to go there but will never accept because the manager is a racist. Thankfully he hasn’t met you.’ Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's story in Thursday's Daily Mail . Revelation: Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Moody's text message exchanges . Sportsmail has also been made aware of a note Mackay is claimed to have attached to an email in September 2012. It is understood the former Watford manager was inadvertently forwarded an email from a gay season-ticket holder at Vicarage Road, who had contacted that club complaining of feeling intimidated by homophobic chants during a match between Watford and Brighton. Mackay is said to have forwarded the email to Moody, apparently declaring ironically: ‘A must read!!’ Finally, a reference to a female colleague in an exchange of emails does not reflect well on Mackay either. Mackay had complained that the trouser press in his hotel room was not working. One colleague suggests he get a female colleague to fix it. ‘She can’t,’ Mackay replied. She’s shovelling **** for my roses.’ On Friday night, Sportsmail tried to put the latest revelations to Bevan as Mackay’s representative, without success. Claim: It is understood Mackay,  at Watford, forwarded a message to Moody from a gay season-ticket holder . Mackay went on Sky Sports News last night and made what he described as an unreserved apology for the ‘three messages’ he sent. He said he was not ‘racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic or sexist’. A chastened Mackay also said ‘banter’ was not a word he would have used, suggesting he allowed the LMA to send the apology without first letting him read it. He sought to distance himself from Moody, who resigned as Crystal Palace’s sporting director in the wake of Sportsmail’s revelations, stressing that he had merely received many of the messages. Mackay also denied any wrongdoing in the transfer market, mistakenly believing he is the subject of an FA investigation into transfers at Cardiff. At this stage the FA have only received information regarding text messages. He said: ‘Out of 10,000 text messages in and out of someone’s phone I have sent three and they are completely unacceptable, inappropriate. For that I sincerely apologise. I did it in a period when I was under immense pressure. That doesn’t excuse anything.’ Mackay also said he would be ‘asking about equality and diversity training’, while insisting he would ‘come back from this’. Sportsmail’s revelations  will provide further questions for Mackay and Moody to answer should an FA investigation end with a charge. Yesterday the FA did not respond to developments, in particular the ill-advised apology issued on Mackay’s behalf on Thursday, to avoid prejudicing their investigation. But Sportsmail understands there is a real appetite at the FA to pursue the case. Disgraced: Malky Mackay is being investigated by The FA . Shock: Iain Moody, Crystal Palace's director of football and Mackay's former colleague, has also been reported . The LMA, and in particular Bevan, came under huge pressure yesterday after daring to dismiss Mackay’s racism as ‘banter’. The use of the word sparked widespread anger among anti-racism campaigners and eventually led to an apology for the initial apology, issued yesterday morning, by the LMA. A statement from the LMA said: ‘The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention. ‘Any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable. The LMA will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to Malky Mackay whilst The FA conducts its investigation.’ That, however, did not satisfy Cardiff, who said: ‘The LMA is the representative voice of managers, and whilst we understand it seeks to act in the best interests of its members, one of its major aims is to “encourage honourable practice, conduct and courtesy in all professional activity”. Reported: Cardiff were required to tell the FA,  found by investigators from the Mishcon de Reya law firm . ‘Regrettably, we feel that the LMA has done no such thing in its representation of Mr Mackay and Mr Moody. The LMA were aware of the allegations from the morning of the search order, and their lawyers acted for Mr Mackay and Mr Moody throughout the legal process. ‘That the LMA has sought to criticise the Club for the timing of the report to the FA is preposterous, because the offensive communications have been in the possession of the LMA for many months. When the messages came to light, over three months ago, the Club strongly encouraged and advised Mr Moody and Mr Mackay to deal with the issue directly with the FA. It was made clear to them, and their LMA appointed lawyers, that the nature of the communications meant the Club was under a duty to report their findings to the FA if they did not take appropriate action them-selves. Nevertheless, with the backing of the LMA, Mr Moody and Mr Mackay chose to do nothing. ‘The LMA were therefore complicit in the attempt to conceal these messages (of which there were many more than the two acknowledged by Mr Mackay). ‘We also point out that the LMA members have a ‘‘Code of Conduct’’ incorporated into their managerial contracts. One of the requirements is “A Manager shall not use racist or other discriminatory language”. We therefore find it entirely reprehensible that the LMA should itself put out a statement which seeks to dismiss deeply offensive racist comments as “friendly banter”. Sorry: Malky Mackay issued a poorly-worded statement through the League Managers Association . ‘If that is the view held by the LMA, as appears from its statement, we consider that Richard Bevan’s position is untenable and we call for his resignation.’ To add to the pressure, Leroy Rosenior, one of England’s few black managers, has threatened to resign from the LMA. He said: ‘If the LMA are going back into the dark ages to support people then I might have to withdraw my support. ‘In over 70,000 text messages I’ve sent I’ve never used inappropriate language and I’m sure neither have the vast majority of people. ‘I know the LMA are trying to protect their member, but in doing so I feel they are almost abusing another member, like myself.’ Today’s revelations will pile further pressure on Mackay and Moody and will also add fuel to those calling for Bevan to step down.","Sportsmail can reveal further offensive texts sent between former Cardiff City boss Malky Mackay and Iain Moody .

"Under Nobel Peace Prize-winning President Barack Obama, America's nuclear weapons spending will eclipse $1 trillion over the next 30 years as the United States spent more in 2014 on its arsenal than at any time in its history – including during the Cold War and World War II. The stunning news from The New York Times comes just five years after a newly minted Obama won the Prize for, in part, using international diplomacy to further a 'vision of a world free from nuclear arms.' The Nobel committee wrote just nine months after Obama took office that his creation of a 'new climate in international politics' had already led to 'dialogue and negotiations' being 'preferred as instruments for resolving even the most difficult international conflicts.' 'The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations,' Obama's award citation read, describing his accomplishments. But the Times reported Monday on its front page that a massive effort to revitalize and refurbish America's crumbling nuclear weapons resources has become a spending sprint, catapulting the U.S. past Cold War levels. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . $687 million: A month-old Kansas City, MIssouri factory will make parts for nuclear weapons systems, undercutting President Obama's earliest pledges to trim back the US arsenal . A 'vision of a world free from nuclear arms': Obama collected his Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, given in part for his pledges related to nuclear disarmament on a global scale . Obama campaigned in 2008 on a platform that included achieving 'a nuclear-free world,' and sought to nudge the country in that direction by modestly rebuilding America's nukes in order to make them more convincing leverage in discussions about global cuts in the number of warheads. But as Congress sunk its teeth in new home-district spending opportunities and both Russia and China have seized opportunities to rattle sabers, the atomic reboot has taken on a life of its own. As a result, the Department of Energy and the Atomic Energy Commission spent upwards of $11 billion this year on nuclear weapons research, development, testing and production. That number doesn't include any Defense Department spending on aircraft, missile silos or staffing to keep the nuclear button a viable option in the event of a first-strike by one of America's enemies. The Brookings Institution estimated in 1998 that the entirety of the Manhattan Project and other spending on nuclear weapons research and production from 1940 to 1945 amounted to $30.3 billion, in 2014 dollars. That six-year figure is less than the projected U.S. nuclear spending for each of the next 30 years, according to a January 2014 research paper published by the Monterey Institute of International Studies, a graduate school of the far-left-leaning Middlebury College in Vermont. The ramp-up of spending has left some of Obama's early supporters dumbfounded. Quaint? The 1983 film 'War Games' portrayed nuclear weapons buildups as a sure road to global ruin, but America has never changed its deterrence strategy . Cheap: The atomic bomb that leveled Hiroshima in 1945 came from a government program that spent less in five years than the US will spend on its successor in each of the next 30 . Ageing: America's nuclear launch facilities are an often-derided throwback to the 1970s, with antiquated computers that spending advocates argue are in desperate need of replacement . 'A lot of it is hard to explain,' former Democratic U.S. Senator Sam Nunn told the Times. 'The president's vision was a significant change in direction. But the process has preserved the status quo.' But as geopolitics shift, the appetite for weakening America's offensive weaponry has all but disappeared. 'The most fundamental game changer is Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,' Gary Samore, Obama’s principal nuclear adviser during his first term added. 'That has made any measure to reduce the stockpile unilaterally politically impossible.' The game changed earlier than that, however. The 1.5 million-square-foot Kansas City National Security Campus opened last month after $687 million of spending that was authorized in the waning months of the George W. Bush presidency. 'The successful construction of the National Security Campus here in Kansas City is part of our broader effort to transform our Cold War era infrastructure into a 21st century nuclear security enterprise,' Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said during a dedication ceremony. And with that modernization, the U.S. is pot-committed in the never-ending high stakes poker game that is global nuclear diplomacy. CHANGE: Obama promised to work for nuclear disarmament in 2008 as a presidential candidate -- something that hasn't made America's 21st-century foes budge much . Crumbling: Many of America's long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles are in dire need of refurbishment, and some of suspected of not being able to perform as intended . Former Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman told the Times that 'the whole design of the modernization enables us to make reductions' in spending in the future. The new plant, officials say, will save $150 million in energy costs each year. That number, however, may be part of an endless stream of pledges from the Obama administration that have yet to bear fruit. A senior aide to a Republican senator who will be involved in budget negotiations for the 2016 fiscal year – a haggling process that will begin in January or February – told MailOnline that there will likely be opposition from both sides of the aisle if Obama proposes any kind of cuts. 'Democrats don't want their 2016 [presidential] candidate to have to run on a legacy of weakness,' he said. 'Plus, in the Senate they've never seen a spending bill they couldn't excuse.' 'And some Republicans,' he offered, 'are still pining for Reagan's ""peace through strength"" years from the Soviet days. With Putin going crazy, we might need that outlook again.'","The US spent more in 2014 on nuclear weapons research, development, testing and production than ever, including during World War II .

"CLICK HERE to read Matt Lawton on the punishment suggested for Malky Mackay by former FA chief Lord Triesman . The extent to which Malky Mackay’s astonishing text messages were riddled with abuse has been described as ‘shocking’ by Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen in the latest damning condemnation of the Scot. Football has rounded on the former Cardiff City manager and Iain Moody since Sportsmail uncovered a range of racist, sexist and homophobic exchanges between the pair. The developments of the last five days cost the 42-year-old a return to management with Crystal Palace and saw Moody resign as sporting director at Selhurst Park. Scroll down for videos... Aftermath: Caretaker manager Keith Millen says Crystal Palace are suffering from the Malky Mackay saga . Out: Malky Mackay was close to becoming the Eagles' next boss before Sportsmail revealed offensive texts . Mackay was ready to be unveiled as Palace’s manager on Wednesday and given plenty of assistance in the transfer market to bring in much-needed reinforcements. That job has now been left with Millen, who is in caretaker charge following Tony Pulis’s departure on the eve of the season. Millen said: ‘I don’t know how far down the line we were in terms of agreeing for him (Mackay) to be our manager but for all this to come out was shocking. ‘It’s not right what has been said. We knew there was something between Iain, Malky and Cardiff when they left but that all looked to have settled down. Iain is very good at his job but the stuff out there isn’t right. Caught: Crystal Palace sporting director Iain Moody (left) was sacked for his part in the 'shocking' text scandal . West Ham scored three goals away from home for the first time since beating Tottenham on October 6 . ‘It’s a shame. Malky is a good football person and a good manager. I’m sure he will be (a good manager) again.’ Palace are innocent bystanders in this rumpus but the trouble it has caused was encapsulated on Saturday against West Ham. The Eagles, by Millen’s admission, were ‘fragile’ and had the ‘stuffing knocked out’ of them. The chief beneficiary of the incendiary revelations surrounding Mackay could have been Millen, but he saw his side gift goals in a deflating defeat to lay bare the problems Pulis has left behind. Hammer time: Stewart Downing strikes as West Ham beat Crystal Palace 3-1 at Upton Park . Strikes from Mauro Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole deflated the mood, with Marouane Chamakh’s drive scant consolation. After a gallant display at Arsenal on the opening day, this was hardly the ringing endorsement Millen craved from his players. ‘The way this week has materialised is tough to take. It has been very confusing for what we were trying to do,’ he said. After Tim Sherwood ruled himself out of the job, Palace co-chairman Steve Parish must begin the hunt all over again. Millen added: ‘It’s not ideal. The board had done their homework and spoken to people. There are plenty who would want it.’ Those include Colombia boss Jose Pekerman and ex-Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, but neither possess the Premier League pedigree Parish wants. He is prepared to wait — it took more than a month to appoint Pulis — and has told Millen he may have to hold tight.

"Dave Whelan saw in the new year at his holiday home in Barbados and the Wigan chairman no doubt reflected on a tumultuous 2014. But there seems little chance he will stick to his promise, issued in the wake of his racist comments about the Chinese and Jewish communities, to stand down if found guilty by the FA. Sportsmail understands Whelan could remain in the Caribbean for three months, returning to Britain only after his ban has been served. The FA have removed him from ‘all football and football activity’ for six weeks and fined him £50,000. Further to that, Whelan has been warned as to his future conduct and ordered to undertake an education programme. Dave Whelan (left) has been banned for six weeks and fined £50,000 by the Football Association . Whelan previously said he would resign from his role at Wigan if the FA suggested he was racist . Bolton (Away) - January 3 . Birmingham (Away) - January 10 . Blackburn (Away) - January 17 . Huddersfield (Home) - January 24 . Ipswich (Away) - January 31 . Bournemouth (Home) - February 7 . But Wigan officials were quick to highlight what they view as the key part of the FA independent commission’s written reasons — due to be published in full on New Year's Day — which state that their owner is not racist. Indeed a club spokesman, asked why the 78-year-old chairman would not resign given what he had said to ITV, insisted Whelan only offered to stand down ‘if he was found guilty of being a racist’. That is not true. No such distinction was made to ITV, with Whelan saying: ‘If the FA look into my affairs, and they were to find me guilty — which I hope they don’t and I don’t see anything like that happening because I’m absolutely anti-racist — however, if they have any questions, I’m willing to answer it and, should they even suggest I’m guilty, I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan.’ The same club spokesman said it would be wrong to read too much into the appointment of Whelan’s grandson, David Sharpe, to the Wigan board. While he might well succeed Whelan eventually, that move does not appear imminent. Three years to the day since the FA published the reasons for the conclusion they reached in the Luis Suarez-Patrice Evra racism affair, Whelan was punished for his comments. In trying to justify his controversial appointment of Malky Mackay as manager at a time when Mackay remained the subject of an FA investigation into an exchange of racist, sexist and homophobic messages — an investigation that, amazingly, remains ongoing despite the fact this newspaper published details of the messages in August — Whelan talked himself into trouble in an interview with The Guardian. He said it was ‘nothing’ to call a Chinese person a ‘chink’ and stated: ‘Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.’ Wigan chairman Whelan will not be allowed to attend his side's next six matches . The Latics are currently languishing in the Championship relegation zone, having won just four league games . He then compounded the situation in an interview with the Jewish Telegraph when he said he used to refer to Chinese people as ‘Chingalings’. Whelan has seven days to appeal but a club spokesman said last night that he was being urged by the club not to do so. An FA spokesman explained Whelan’s ban prevents him from any form of ‘League contact, or contact with other clubs, involvement in transfers, attendance at games or at Wigan’s training ground’. In their own statement, Wigan responded: ‘The FA hand Latics chairman Dave Whelan a ban and fine following media comments but confirm they are satisfied that “he is not a racist”. Malky Mackay (left) is also being investigated over texts exchanged with former colleague Iain Moody . MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . How the Daily Mail exposed and covered the continuing scandal over Mackay's inappropriate texts . ‘In summary, the FA Commission concluded that: “We are satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan is not a racist. We are equally satisfied on the evidence before us that Mr Whelan did not intend to cause any offence by his comments. It is clear that he himself is very upset by the words he used and he moved very quickly to apologise, plead guilty and begin to make amends”. ‘However, the commission explained that it had a duty to “view the comments objectively and Mr Whelan’s subjective intentions were irrelevant as far the ruling was concerned”, hence the punishment announced today.

"Kurt Fearnley is a man determined not to let one aspect of who he is define him. Born with a congenital disorder which prevented the growth of his lower spine and sacrum, Fearnley has spent his life doing exactly what he believes he should be doing- living life to the full. ‘You always have the ability within to live your life, pushing the limits,' the three-time Paralympic Gold medallist told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you learn to accept yourself you can't just accept bits and pieces. I couldn't imagine my life any other way. Disability is just another aspect of a person.' ‘You always have the ability within to live your life, pushing the limits,' the three-time Paralympic Gold medalist told Daily Mail Australia . ‘If I were offered the chance to walk tomorrow I would jump at it, but if it meant losing the person I have become I would not swap it in a million years,' Fearnley said . ‘People have this idea that struggling is a bad thing, but struggling is brilliant. If you see someone struggle and overcome it, it is infectious. It makes you feel good to be alive.’ From the man who has won has won the New York City wheelchair marathon five times,  sailed the Sydney to Hobart race, was recognised as the 2009 Young Australian of the Year, and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia, this seems like advice from experience. ‘If I were offered the chance to walk tomorrow I would jump at it, but if it meant losing the person I have become I would not swap it in a million years,' Fearnley said in his new memoir, Pushing the Limits. 'If I could choose between the reality of walking and the idea that I could achieve anything I set out to do, I would take the idea every time.’ In 2009, Fearnley took on a challenge that would make even the most hardened athlete balk- conquering the Kokoda Trail. The ten-day hike is considered one of the most formidable treks in the world, along the unforgiving landscape of the Owen Stanley Range in Papua New Guinea's mountains and dense forest. Fearnley has won the New York City wheelchair marathon five times, sailed the Sydney to Hobart race, was recognised as the 2009 Young Australian of the Year, and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia . Fearnley decided that he would crawl the 96 kilometre trail, and set out to train himself mentally, physically and spiritually, and knowing that he would be in the company of his family and friends gave the preparation a focus . Despite this, Fearnley said that the thought that he wouldn't take on the test of endurance simply because of his disability never entered his mind. 'I grew up with the idea that life can be hard. Deal with it. There's no way I would choose to live a life sitting on the sidelines. I'm here, I'm in it and I'm part of it. If I am remembered for anything I want to be remembered for this: I was prepared to grab hold of life and rip it to pieces.' The idea for the epic hike began among tragic circumstances, following the unexpected death of his cousin Pete in a car accident. The media-dubbed 'wheelchair marathon man' said that the idea bubbled away under the surface for a few months, but began to take shape when his brothers, many of his cousins, and five of his friends all committed to the idea as a way of reinforcing the bond between them which had resurfaced in the wake of Pete's death. After reading a compelling account of a Victorian solider who had been shot in both ankles and dragged himself along the Kokoda Trail rather than make his fellow soldiers carry him, Fearnley was inspired, and his determination to tackle the track reinvigorated. He decided that he would crawl the 96 kilometre trail, and set out to train himself mentally, physically and spiritually, and knowing that he would be in the company of his family and friends gave the preparation a focus. 'Life's not about watching. It's about getting in there and getting your hands dirty and being a part of it,' Fearnley said . 'We all have the ability to be who we want to be, and we have to choose that and choose it repeatedly, because going through hardship is not all about gold or joy,' Fearnley said . ‘Our motivation was to be there together and to be there for each other. It was not about me trying to prove that I could crawl every metre of the way,' he wrote. 'It was not about me trying to prove anything. I didn’t need to drag myself bloody. This was not a competition or a race. If I, or any of us, needed to be helped or supported or carried for a while, we knew we had only to ask.’ On the eve of the hike, Fearnley and his fellow hikers were meeting some of the locals, when a man who had grown up on the trail but had broken his back told the Paralympian that in his culture, children with disabilities were hidden, or kept to the side of rooms, and not allowed to interact with the wider community. He told Fearnley, ‘While you’re crawling on the track you’re going to make people question that belief. Every person with a disability that’s being kept in those rooms, they’re going to be with you on the track. They’re going to be there on your shoulders.’ Fearnley said that the powerful assertion weighed heavily on him, and made him reassess the impact that his journey would have not only on himself, but on others who looked up to him and saw him as a beacon for change. ‘Right hang on, this has become much bigger than I ever intended, or ever imagined,' he said. Kurt with baby Harry.  He has got through a lot of challenges thanks to the support of family and friends . Kurt Fearnley (pictured far left) with his family wife Sheridan and son Harry got to open the Nasdaq after the New York marathon . Throughout the gruelling journey, Fearnley found himself constantly bombarded by experiences and emotions he hadn't expected. From his injuries sustained from crawling across mud-splattered ground and scattered debris, to developing an intimate bond with his PNG 'porters' who helped him scale some of the impenetrable track, Fearnley found himself acutely aware of, and even uncomfortable with, asking for assistance. ‘Being a man who is so intent on being self-sufficient, it was disconcerting to feel that I genuinely needed help to continue and that there was nothing wrong with asking for it.’ However, following the trail which was haunted with the memories and sacrifices of the soldiers who had journeyed the distance, out of fear and necessity rather than willingly, was one of the most emotionally significant aspects of the trek. The group reached Eora Creek, the site where more Australian casualties died in Papua New Guinea than any other, on Remembrance Day, which Fearnley said was a profoundly moving experience. ‘We sat there visualising the conflict, and how surreal and mournful the experience must have been for those young soldiers almost seven decades earlier,' he said. ‘Many were brave and idealistic striplings laying down their lives in a strange and unforgiving land.’ ‘I have believed the constant hum in my ears telling me that I am powerful and that the world is my canvas, to colour as I see fit,' said Kurt . Three time Paralympic gold medallist Kurt Fearnley (pictured) has taken on many challenges including sailing the Sydney to Hobart race . ‘It made me think about the people who were calling me a hero for crawling the track. The heroes were the soldiers and the Fuzzy Wuzzies who had slogged it out in 1942. I was just a fella trying to get as much as I could out of life,' he said in his memoir. Fearnley decidedly did exactly that on the Kokoda Trail, losing seven kilos from the sheer effort of pulling himself by his arms along the track. Arriving at the end, he said that he and his travelling companions had achieved more than they thought they were capable of. ‘We felt like we had plunged to the worst lows and soared to the greatest heights, and now that we had endured it all, we felt indomitable. As though there was nothing, physically, mentally, or emotionally, that we could not endure.’ ‘I have believed the constant hum in my ears telling me that I am powerful and that the world is my canvas, to colour as I see fit. At some point that feedback took hold, my world shifted, and I understood that disability would never be a weight and would never drag me down.' Kurt Fearnley (pictured bottom right) celebrates with friends after winning the New York wheelchair marathon . For Fearnley, the battle to overcome Kokoda was significant, but certainly wasn't the only challenge he has faced in his life, nor will it be the last. This is not something that daunts this man, who crawled Kokoda, who seeks to push himself, and who never wants himself, or anyone else with a disability, to be limited by an aspect that does not define them. 'Life's not about watching. It's about getting in there and getting your hands dirty and being a part of it,' he said. 'That’s what I consider to be living. I was the beneficiaries of people who would stand up when I couldn’t, and if my story helps even one kid to have a better quality of life, that's amazing.' 'We all have the ability to be who we want to be, and we have to choose that and choose it repeatedly, because going through hardship is not all about gold or joy.' 'Life is about making it through the more shadowy moments and harder periods. That’s as much who you are as the other parts, and we should have as much pride attached to that as anything else.'","Kurt Fearnley, three-time Paralympic Gold medallist, has released his memoir, 'Pushing the Limits', which details his life and his determination to never let his disability define him .

"Bojan Krkic  underwent an operation in Barcelona on Wednesday as the Stoke City forward steps up his recuperation after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury. Former Barcelona striker Bojan, 24, went under the surgeon's knife at the Deixus hospital in Barcelona and Sportsmail understands that the operation - which lasted just under one hour and a half - went as planned. He suffered the injury during Stoke's 4-1 victory at Rochdale in the FA Cup. Bojan Krkic receives treatment after damaging his cruciate knee ligament against Rochdale in January . Bojan underwent surgery on the injured knee on Wednesday - Sportsmail understands it went as planned . As first revealed by Sportsmail, Bojan's ambition is to be back running within three months and he is hopeful of returning to light training in May. Initial scans suggested that Bojan could be set for up to six months on the sidelines but subsequent tests have demonstrated that although the anterior cruciate ligament suffered damage, the meniscus and the two lateral ligaments have not been adversely affected. Providing that his recovery continues without complications, Bojan will be fully fit and ready to go on the first day of pre-season for Stoke. Bojan celebrates the opening goal of the FA Cup tie before suffering the injury that will keep him out for the remainder of the season . He will still miss the remainder of this campaign but fears that he may also be absent for the beginning of next season have been dispelled. The striker will now rest with his family following the operation but a decision is yet be taken as to whether he will return to Stoke to continue his period of recuperation or if he will remain in Catalonia and use Barcelona's facilities.","Bojan Krkic damaged his cruciate knee ligament in January .

"Alex Rodriguez, returning from a year-long doping ban, surprised the New York Yankees with his unexpected arrival at the team's training camp on Monday where he said he cringed at some of the mistakes he had made. The disgraced slugger showed up two days before he was due to report and received a physical exam and took batting practice at the minor league complex before meeting with reporters. 'I feel healthy and ready to go,' said Rodriguez, adding that he thought a year off resting his body and training had benefited him. 'I'm confident if I stay healthy I can do good things. New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez bunts the ball while taking batting practice . 'Plenty of mistakes along the way. I cringe sometimes when I look at some of the things I did. But I paid my penalty and I'm grateful that I have another opportunity.' Toting a box of bats and wearing a green University of Miami sweat suit, the 39-year-old Rodriguez made his highly anticipated arrival without letting the team know in advance. Asked what to expect when Rodriguez reported, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said he would be treated like any other player as far as the team were concerned. Rodriguez signs autographs for fans following a workout for spring training baseball . 'From my end, it'll be, he'll show up like everybody else,' said Cashman. 'He'll be in his hitting group and his fielding group, stretching, all that stuff, conditioning side of it. It'll be no different from our end.' Rodriguez, who ranks fifth on Major League Baseball's all-time home run list with 654, also fielded grounders and put in some jogging in the outfield. Rodriguez was one of 14 players suspended in 2013 stemming from the Biogenesis scandal and was originally handed a 211-game ban. He was the only player to appeal and the punishment was lowered to 162 games. Rodriguez runs while working out at the Yankees' minor league complex in Tampa . Last week, Rodriguez issued a handwritten apology to fans for 'the mistakes' he made. Rodriguez, who is owed $61 million by the team for the remaining three years on his contract, has not appeared in a game since September 2013, and his mobility is in question after having had surgery on both his hips. During the offseason, the Yankees signed third baseman Chase Headley to a four-year, $52million contract in a move that appeared to consign three-time league MVP Rodriguez to designated hitter duties.

"A couple's £3,000 state-of-the art sofa started a blaze which swept through their home killing their pet dog. Fire fighters discovered the body of Ross and Kim Marvin's four-year-old pet after they battled their way through  flames and thick black smoke. The Jack Russell and Chihuahua cross was overcome by fumes, after the inferno was sparked by an electrical fault in the couch. File photo - this is not the sofa referred to in the article . The couple are now planning to sue sofa giants ScS after they claim they have 'been left with nothing' after the blaze. The Marvin's brought the Endurance Invincible sofa, which contained a Bluetooth-capable sound system with speaker and sub woofer, from furniture giant ScS for £3,149. Mr Marvin, a recruitment consultant, said: 'If it had happened while we were sleeping we would be dead.' The 28-year-old told how he was fought back by the choking black smoke after arriving home and discovering the blaze. 'I thought the curtains were drawn at first, it was that black,' he said. 'I went round the back to the kitchen because I knew Rolo was inside. 'I went in through the smoke - you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. I only got as far as the kitchen table before I had to come outside. 'I nearly passed out and had to lean on a fence to recover. The firemen offered me oxygen, but I gradually recovered.' Rolo was found by fire fighters in an upstairs bedroom at the couple's home in Wigston, Leicester, and despite fire fighters efforts was declared dead. 'We've had him (Rolo) since he was a pup,' said Mrs Marvin, aged 29 years. 'He was a wedding present to ourselves. 'It's just devastating, Rolo was like my little baby. We treated him just like a baby. 'The only consolation is we're still here. If it had happened at a different time of day, it could have been a different story.' A spokesman for Leicester Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that the cause of the fire was accidental and started following an electrical fault within the sofa unit. The Marvins', who had no contents insurance, now face a hefty bill to repair the damage to their rented semi-detached home. ScS have  stopped the stricken couple's monthly repayments on the sofa and offered them new furniture. 'I'm afraid their offer is not acceptable,' said Mr Marvin. 'We have lost everything in the fire and now we've been told the landlord is holding us responsible because it was our sofa that started the fire.' 'The landlord's agent called us and said sorry for our loss and asked what state the house was in. 'They told us we would have to meet the cost of all the damage to the landlord's property - and carry on paying rent. 'But a clause in the tenancy agreement says the landlord is responsible for insuring the property and his own contents. We have no insurance on the property.' A spokeswoman for ScS said: 'Our thoughts are entirely with the family at this time. We have offered to assist them if we can. 'We do not know what the cause of the fire was, and a full investigation is required. As such, it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'","Ross and Kim Marvin brought the Endurance Invincible sofa from ScS .

"More than a quarter of people in Britain have never heard of out-of-hours services and have no idea how to see a GP on evenings or weekends (file picture) Millions still have no idea how to see a GP when they fall ill at evenings and weekends, MPs warn today. More than a quarter have never heard of out-of-hours services – a decade after they came in – and the system remains patchy and confusing. In some areas, four in ten who did manage to find a doctor said the experience was poor or dreadful. MPs on the Public Accounts Committee say the system is too complicated, highly variable and means many patients wrongly end up in A&E. GPs have been able to opt out of providing care at evenings and weekends since 2004 under a Labour-negotiated deal that also saw their average salaries exceed £100,000. In most areas, the work is subcontracted to private firms which employ local doctors, or locums, from elsewhere in England or abroad. The firms include Harmoni and Serco, which have been accused of running care on the cheap and employing a single GP or nurse to cover of hundreds of thousands of patients. The MPs’ report cites figures showing that 26 per cent of patients have not heard of GP out-of-hours services – rising to 43 per cent of those aged 18 to 24. NHS bosses had hoped to make it easier with the launch of the 111 helpline, which is meant to offer advice round-the-clock. Yet 18 months on, a third of patients do not know it exists or do not understand what it is for. MPs also warn that the standards of out-of-hours care vary unacceptably across the country. The worst is Corby, Northamptonshire, where 41 per cent of patients who used services rated them as ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’. The report also draws attention to the fact that some GPs are handing out contracts to out-of-hours firms they own shares in. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: ‘People turn to out-of-hours GP services when they are worried about their own health or that of family or friends, and want urgent advice or treatment. However, the urgent and emergency care system is complex and people struggle to know which is the right service to use. ‘Too many people are unaware of the different urgent care options and of how to contact them. As a result of the confusion, too many go to A&E when they do not need to.’ Four in ten people who did manage to find a doctor described the experience as poor or dreadful (file picture) Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘We are worried about patients being seen by GPs who know nothing about them and appear to have little interest in finding out what is wrong with them. It is probably unrealistic to expect a return to the days when family doctors carried out their own night and weekend calls, but at the very least NHS England should be able to demonstrate that patients are receiving safe and effective care.’ Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP Committee said: ‘Many GPs are working hard to deliver out of hours to patients but they are being undermined by an increasingly chaotic and underfunded system. ‘With patient demand continuing to rise, especially from an ageing population, this situation is only likely to deteriorate.’ Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb (pictured) said the NHS must be given an extra £1.5billion next year . The NHS must be given an extra £1.5billion next year with a further £1billion a year thereafter, a health minister says. Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb said this had to be a ‘high priority’ and delaying the issue would only betray patients. The Government will unveil its NHS spending plans in the Autumn Statement on December 3. Only last month, NHS bosses said they needed at least an extra £8billion by 2020 to meet the demands of the ageing population. Mr Lamb said: ‘Too often politicians take the easy way out and delay big spending decisions in the hope they become someone else’s problem. Doing that would betray patients. 'The NHS needs significantly more money to help trusts adapt to the changing needs of our population and it can’t afford to wait. ‘That’s why securing extra money for the NHS must be a priority for the whole Government. 'A significant amount of that needs to go on improving mental health services, especially for children and young people.’","More than a quarter of people in UK have not heard of out-of-hours services .

"Oxford University bursar Jean Wright was fired after she said former BBC boss was running the college 'for the kudos on his CV' An Oxford University bursar was sacked after she complained her college was run by former BBC executive Mark Damazer ‘for the kudos on his CV’, she claimed yesterday. Jean Wright, 60, told colleagues the former Radio 4 controller had become a college master at Oxford as ‘a stepping stone to a higher position within the university’. Mr Damazer left a 25-year career at the BBC to become master at St Peter’s College in 2010, and Mrs Wright said she was fired three years later, allegedly following a ‘witch hunt’ to get rid of her. She claims she was the victim of unfair dismissal and disability discrimination, and her employment tribunal against St Peter’s has been told there was a culture of racism, sexism and prejudice at the college. But Mr Damazer, 59, pictured, has denied her ‘spurious’ allegations and accused the former bursar of deliberately seeking to damage both him and the college. Mr Damazer said a string of employees had complained about Mrs Wright being ‘aggressive, hostile, threatening and abusive’ and some had threatened to leave because of her behaviour. Mrs Wright claimed staff at the college, whose former students include Bank of England governor Mark Carney and TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, turned against her after she accused a volunteer archivist, Geoffrey Fouquet, of bullying. She said: ‘I wouldn’t want anybody to be treated like that, it was absolutely dreadful. When I asked Mark Damazer how he intended to protect me, he told me that if the matter had to go to tribunal then so be it. I was taken aback and very upset.’ Mrs Wright described numerous other problems with Mr Fouquet, including one incident in September 2011 when he was alleged to have said to a cleaner: 'I do like to see a woman on her knees.' Despite numerous complaints and an investigation, Mr Fouquet was allowed to continue working at the college. Mrs Wright said: 'I felt that the college did not take my complaints seriously, did not properly investigate them, and did not understand the distress that I had suffered.' When Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010, Mrs Wright met with him to express her concerns about Mr Fouquet. 'He did not appear to me to be sympathetic during the meeting and no resolution to the problems of bullying towards me was offered,' said Mrs Wright. College Master Mark Damazer CBE, (pictured left outside the hearing in Reading, Berks) was controller of BBC Radio 4 and BBC 7 before he took up the role. Jean Wright (pictured right) told the tribunal there had been a conspiracy to oust her from her role. She added that Mr Damazer did not reply to emails in which she complained about bullying from Mr Fouquet and told him she was depressed. On June 27, 2012, Mrs Wright was told Mr Fouquet would be retiring at the end of the year but would still be allowed to come to the college. 'When I asked Mark Damazer how he intended to protect me from future bullying and harassment from Geoffrey Fouquet, he told me that I would have to follow the due process of the law by reporting the incidents, and if the matter had to go to tribunal then so be it,' said Mrs Wright. 'I was taken aback and very upset.' In July 2012 a further investigation took place into claims Mr Fouquet bullied and harassed Mrs Wright, but her complaint was not upheld. Early in 2013, Mrs Wright was told a number of allegations had been made against her, including about how she handled an investigation which led to maintenance engineer Roger Hall being sacked. Mr Hall was accused of making offensive comments, including describing a woman called Ruby as 'a black cow'. The decision to sack Mr Hall was overturned on appeal. Mrs Wright said she believed the allegations had been raised because fellows who were friends with Mr Fouquet wanted to get rid of her. 'I felt like I was on the receiving end of a witch hunt and that the college was scraping the bottom of a barrel,' said Mrs Wright. She added that she was 'appalled and upset' by an allegation she had made a terminally-ill employee feel like they could not request time off. Following disciplinary proceedings, Mrs Wright was fired on November 8, 2013. Among the five allegations upheld against Mrs Wright were that she said about Mr Damazer: 'He's here for the kudos on his CV - he will be off soon. This is a stepping stone to a higher position within the university as I have been told he is very ambitious.' It was ruled these comments made staff feel 'vulnerable'. Other reasons for her dismissal were the way she handled the Mr Hall investigation, claims she accused a housekeeper of lying about being ill and a suggestion she was 'aggressive, hectoring and frightening' during a staff meeting. Jean Wright, 60, is suing St Peter's College (pictured) for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination . Mrs Wright said: 'Some had complained about me in circumstances where I had identified issues with their performance and it had been made clear that the Master was receptive to complaints. 'I believe that Geoffrey Fouquet's friends were involved in orchestrating, or encouraging, those complaints. 'The college maintain that it would have been impossible for me to return to work because of the breakdown in relations with my staff. 'I believe that after 17 years of effectively managing the staff the college put me in an impossible situation and then chose to dismiss me.' Mr Damazer has denied there was any conspiracy to oust Mrs Wright as a result of the Fouquet allegations. He previously told the tribunal: 'The claimant has sought to make spurious allegations about matters which do not pertain to her dismissal in order to cause damage to the college and to myself. These allegations are untrue and without foundation. 'While I was not directly involved in the decision making process I believe that the claimant was shown on the evidence to have acted in a way which was not only reprehensible in itself but an abuse of power in respect of her subordinates.'

"Judd Trump benefited from a first-round walkover on Tuesday when Chinese opponent Rouzi Maimaiti had visa problems, and the Bristolian was largely untroubled on Saturday in what became his opening match as he brushed aside Indian Aditya Mehta. The 2011 UK champion won through to the third round by beating Mehta 6-1, highlighted by a century in the fifth frame. Elsewhere, world champion Mark Selby suffered a shock exit at the hands of world number 62 David Morris. Judd Trump is through after beating Adtiya Mehta 6-1 in the UK Championship second round . Indian Mehta could cope with the Englishman during the match at the Barbican in York . He will concede top ranking to Robertson or Ding Junhui, and was not altogether surprised by the performance from his opponent. 'I've known him for a few years and I know he dropped off the tour and thought about stopping playing, but I know the potential he has got he should be doing a lot better than he is at the moment' said Selby, after the shock 6-4 defeat. 'He showed what a good player he is out there.' China's Ding Junhui avoided going the same way as Selby, fending off crowd favourite Jimmy White in winning 6-2.

Carmarthen's Matthew Stevens, who beat Stephen Hendry in the 2003 UK final, saw off Kent-based Northern Irishman Gerard Greene 6-3. Greene had a 139 break in the opening frame, which means he and Patrick are early pace-setters in the battle for the tournament's £10,000 top-break prize.

"A new way of diagnosing glaucoma which involves patients watching episodes of Dad's Army has been developed by scientists. By scanning and analysing their eye movements, researchers at City University London were able to identify cases of the common eye disease, with almost 80 per cent accuracy. The irreversible condition is caused by progressive damage to the optic nerve, and leads to a loss of peripheral vision and eventual blindness. Scientists have developed a new test to detect glaucoma, by scanning and analysing eye movements as a person watches TV. While studying glaucoma patients and healthy individuals, they used clips from Dad's Army . Around the world it is thought to affect 65 million people, but many remain undiagnosed. Scientists hope the eye movement test will in future allow clinicians to spot cases earlier, allowing treatment to begin while there is still time to save a patient's sight. In a study involving 44 elderly glaucoma patients and 32 healthy individuals, the system identified 79 per cent of those who had the disease. The rate of false diagnoses of healthy individuals was one in 10. Lead scientist Professor David Crabb, from City University London, said: 'These are early results but we've found we can identify patients with glaucoma by monitoring how people watch TV. 'This could make a huge difference in detecting or monitoring a disease which currently results in one in 10 of all blindness registrations in the UK and about a million NHS appointments a year for those with the disease. A complete eye examination includes five common tests to detect glaucoma. It is important people have their eyes tested regularly. Before the age of 40 it is recommended people have a test every two years. From 40 to 54 that should increase to every one to three years. Between the ages of 55 to 64 a test should be performed every two years and after the age of 65, this should be every year. The five tests measure: . 'Once the damage is done it cannot be reversed, so early diagnosis is vital for identifying a disease which will continue to get more prevalent as our population ages.' The study participants, who had an average age of 69, were  asked to watch TV and film clips on a computer. Professor Crabb said the clips included episodes of an old favourite, Dad's Army. At the same time, their eye movements were tracked and the information fed into a computer. The software plotted the saccade patterns - fast movements of the eye - on to a grid and was able to spot subtle differences between them. Certain patterns, only clearly discernible by the computer, correlated with having glaucoma. 'What we've done is use a mathematical technique to find patterns in these grids that allow us to distinguish between the groups,' said Professor Crabb. 'If you look very closely there are features that are slightly different, but you need a computer to recognise them. 'The eye movements are very fast, quicker than heartbeats.' The research stemmed from a theory linking eye movement patterns with loss of peripheral vision. Current tests for gluacoma involve five different steps, carried out during regular eye examinations . Professor Crabb said: 'Someone with moderate glaucoma would have a piece of their field of view that is missing. 'Their brain has to continually move their eyes around to fill in the gaps. We believe the eye movements compensate for the missing information.' He added that a variant of the same technique might be able to diagnose other eye diseases, such as macular degeneration, which is marked by the loss of central vision. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's were also thought to affect eye movements. Dr Dolores Conroy, director of research at the charity Fight for Sight, which funded the study, said: 'One of Fight for Sight's six long-term goals is to enable conditions such as glaucoma to be detected earlier. 'Early diagnosis and treatment can stop people losing their sight, so we're very pleased that this proof-of-principle eye movement study opens the door to developing a new clinical test for glaucoma.'","Scientists at City University London have developed a new glaucoma test .

Once living as a boy, now as a girl: Lance/Cassidy hopes her nomination for homecoming queen will shed light on the issue of being a transgender . Ms Campbell said the nomination was more about her fight for acceptance as a transgender than the title of homecoming queen. ‘Gay people have been brought into the limelight and it’s a very touched on subject,’ she told KTLA5. ‘It’s much more talked about than transgender is.’ Ms Campbell has gained a large following on her YouTube channel where she has posted video clips to show her transformation from a boy to a girl.

"When he set up a website for history buffs, Mick Twomey probably expected to make new friends. Instead he attracted a knife-wielding stalker who waged an extraordinary five-year hate campaign against him. Dennis Gooding, 66, published Mr Twomey’s personal details online and even confronted his girlfriend at her workplace. Dennis Gooding, pictured, was jailed for one year for his campaign against web historian Mick Twomey . Last night the affluent former businessman began a one-year prison sentence after ‘obsessively’ targeting his victim despite a series of arrests. The abuse culminated when Gooding uploaded a photograph of himself snarling and brandishing a large blade at his throat. Mr Twomey, 63, was left so terrified by the ordeal that he sought counselling, and eventually fled the market town of Long Eaton, Derbyshire, to escape Gooding. The retired crime scene investigator manages Nottstalgia.com, a genealogy and history website which has attracted thousands of members from across the world. He banned Gooding from the site after he left abusive and derogatory comments in 2009. Gooding then began to bombard Mr Twomey with threatening messages, and even posted his car registration and telephone numbers online. The stalker also posted pictures of his victim’s face superimposed on a body dressed in Nazi uniform, and confronted his partner at her workplace. Mr Twomey initially struggled to get colleagues from his old force, Derbyshire Police, to investigate. They eventually arrested Gooding twice but he escaped prosecution under ‘restorative justice’ procedures, which saw him simply apologise for his actions. In 2011, after an inquiry by a neighbouring force, Gooding was convicted of harassment and given a 12-month conditional discharge and two-year restraining order. Derby Crown Court jailed Gooding for one year and banned him from contacting Mr Twomey indefinitely . It had little effect, and Derby Crown Court heard that the next year Mr Twomey moved house. A year later, Gooding was arrested after posting the dagger photo online and trying to arrange to meet Mr Twomey using a fake name. Under the picture he had written: ‘This could do some damage in the wrong hands … I’ll keep it, one never knows when it will come in handy.’ Mr Twomey said yesterday: ‘This has had a drastic effect on my life. ‘We fear he knows where we live [now] and will come after us again when he is out of prison.’ Gooding, who admitted breaching a restraining order and stalking, was banned from contacting Mr Twomey and his partner indefinitely. PC Keeley Mansell, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘There is still a limited awareness of stalking even though the problem is increasing with the use of social media. ‘Many people do not fully understand how frightening it is when it is happening to you.’ Mr Twomey added he was grateful to Jennifer Perry from the Digital-Trust, an organisation which assists those who are abused or tormented by others using digital technology.","Dennis Gooding intimidated Mick Twomey over a five-year period .

"Manchester City's two Premier League titles in the past three years have come at an astonishing cost, with the champions paying more per point than any other team. Since City were bought by Abu Dhabi United Group the club have spent almost £500million on transfer fees alone - and the astronomical figure is even higher when wages are taken into account. And despite having earned the third most points during the period, City's net spend per point dwarfs their rivals, coming in at a massive £1,096,000, according to a study by Arabian Business. Manchester City have won two of the last three Premier League titles, but their success has been expensive . Sergio Aguero has been in fine form for City, but he cost the club £38million when he signed in 2011 . The likes of Mario Balotelli and Robinho have been expensive flops for City, who have spent big since 2008 . The next highest spenders per point are Chelsea, who have won just one title in the past six years despite spending £276m on players, at a cost of £598,000 for every point earned. Aston Villa and Stoke City are the next least efficient spenders, splashing out around £300,000 for ever point earned since 2008. At the other end of the scale Everton are the thriftiest of the 11 sides who have been in the top flight for each of the past six seasons. Arsenal's net spend was dented by the purchase of Mesut Ozil in 2013 from Real Madrid for £42.5m . Everton have done some great business to turn a transfer profit, including Seamus Coleman for £60,000 . Under David Moyes and Roberto Martinez the Toffees have managed to make a net gain of almost £30m, earning £78,000 on player sales for every point won in the league. However, an efficient pounds per point ratio isn't always enough - Fulham ranked third in the list over the past six years, collecting points at a bargain of £85,200 each, but it couldn't prevent them suffering relegation to the Championship last season.","Manchester City have won 441 points since 2008 at a cost of £483million .

"Morose: Nicki Minaj pictured on Monday at LAX amid criticism of her Only video . The video for her new song Only was heavily criticised for  use of Nazi imagery and even 'glorifying Hitler' following its release on Saturday. But now, Nicki Minaj has apologised via Twitter, claiming she did not 'come up with the concept' for the animated film. 'I didn't come up w/the concept, but I'm very sorry & take full responsibility if it has offended anyone,' she wrote on her Twitter page on Monday. 'I'd never condone Nazism in my art.' The 31-year-old claimed inspiration for the video was taken from 'a cartoon on Cartoon Network called Metalocalypse & Sin City.' Nicki also said the video's producer and videographer are Jewish. 'Both the producer, & person in charge of over seeing the lyric video (one of my best friends & videographer: A. Loucas), happen to be Jewish,' she added. In fact, as she made her way through LAX on Monday after hosting the MTV Europe Music Awards in Glasgow, Scotland, the singer clarified her comments via TMZ video. When asked  by the website if she had anything to say regarding accusations that her video is anti-Semitic, she replied: 'No, this is my new Jewish boyfriend Alex. why the f*** would I do that. We did this together.' The star then gestured to a man strolling through the airport alongside her. The animated video, which also features Chris Brown, Drake and Lil Wayne, shows Minaj as a dictator type figure and appeared to be inspired by the black and white Nazi-propaganda films of German director Leni Riefenstahl.

"The new treatment could significantly boost older people’s ability to fight off flu and other viruses . A treatment which significantly boosts older people’s ability to fight off flu and other viruses has been developed by British scientists. Once injected with the new chemical, the elderly and vulnerable will have a much for effective immune system, Oxford University researchers claim. They say the drug could give a 90-year-old patient the immune system of someone in their 20s. If the treatment performs well in clinical trials, it could severely reduce a niggling public health problem which costs the NHS millions each year. Flu kills 5,000 people in England annually - the vast majority of them elderly or with existing respiratory conditions. Part of the problem is that the elderly do not react as well as the young to vaccines. The newly-discovered drug promises to boost the power of the flu jab, holding the potential to significantly reduce the danger of common viruses to older people. The compound, called spermidine, has been shown to have a significant impact in tests on mice - and scientists have already patented it as a potential treatment for humans. Each year three-quarters of those aged 65 and over take up the offer to get a flu jab free on the NHS. The policy is the health service’s main tool against the infection – but the benefits of vaccinating pensioners have been seriously questioned in recent years with critics saying there are no figures to back up claims that lives are being saved. This new chemical could solve that problem, the researchers say. It could be mixed in with an existing vaccines or be delivered as a separate jab or a tablet. The research, published yesterday in the journal eLife, showed that the compound restores the immune system’s inbuilt ‘memory’ enabling it to mount a more powerful protective response following vaccination. Tests have shown the chemical can boost the response of mice to the flu virus and cytomegalovirus – or CMV – a common infection which can cause sight problems and pneumonia. The scientists think it might be used to tackle a wider variety of viruses in future. The newly-discovered drug, which contains a compound called spermidine, promises to boost the power of the flu jab, holding the potential to significantly reduce the danger of common viruses (such as flu, pictured) to older people . Study leader Professor Katja Simon said: ‘Viral infections like flu are unpleasant for most people, but can be very serious for the over-65s and vaccines, like the free annual flu jab, are the best form of protection. ‘Our aim is to make that protection even better, by adding immune boosting compounds to routine vaccinations.’ Scientists think vaccines lose effectiveness in older people because as we age, our immune system loses its ‘memory’. It becomes less effective at recognising infections, including those we have had in the past and those we have been vaccinated against. The scientists say their aim is to make protection from viruses even better, by adding immune boosting compounds to routine vaccinations . A key factor is that the white blood cells that coordinate the response to an infection – called T cells – lose the ability to form a ‘memory’ of the infection. Therefore when elderly people encounter a virus they are unable to mount a strong immune response and can develop a serious, even fatal, infection. The new breakthrough rests on the researchers’ discovery of the key cellular process essential for the formation of immune memory. They showed that this process becomes defective in immune cells with age, helping to explain why immunity diminishes over time. By targeting this process with spermidine, the scientists managed to restore immune memory, boosting the effectiveness of a vaccine. Daniel Puleston, who co-authored the research, said of the drug: ‘It’s the equivalent of a 90 year old responding to a vaccine better than a 20 year old, which makes this a very exciting pathway to target as a potential way of boosting vaccine protection in the elderly.’ Spermidine works by enhancing a normal cellular process called autophagy, where parts of the cell that have become defective or damaged are broken down and destroyed within cells. The researchers found that mice lacking a gene important for autophagy couldn’t make memory T cells when given the flu vaccine. They also saw that levels of autophagy were lowered in T cells from aged mice, suggesting that autophagy is a vital part of forming the immune memory into old age. When aged mice were given spermidine prior to flu vaccination, their T cell response was enhanced dramatically. The researchers have patented spermidine and will now see if they can use the compound, or other autophagy-enhancing drugs, to improve responses to already licensed vaccines in mice before hopefully moving on to early safety trials in humans. Professor Simon added: ‘We think that spermidine could be particularly useful alongside many of the vaccines currently in development that protect against other viruses. ‘However, we expect it to be at least five to ten years before a drug reaches the clinic.’","Once injected with the new chemical, the elderly and vulnerable will have a much for effective immune system, British scientists say .

"They are the signature style of superheroes but now they are hitting the mainstream -  that's right brace yourself, this summer sees the return of the catsuit. Glastonbury is well known for sparking a summer trend, just take a look at how well the floral headband took off, but could the latest surge in the famously unflattering skin tight all-in-ones be the craziest yet? Rita Ora and Mary Charteris are well known for their controversial fashion choices but even the slightly tamer dressed, such as Sienna Miller were spotted trussed up in these brightly coloured,  tight numbers. How do you go to the toilet? Rita was spotted in one of Ekaterina Malysheva's bold catsuits at this year's Glastonbury . The signature printed Katsuits and bodies are designed by Ekaterina Malysheva who was inspired by her visit to Nevada's Burning Man Festival and wanted to start a fashion movement with her bold stand-out pieces. Despite many of us being a tad scared of skin-tight lycra the russian born designer has enjoyed great success and is predicted to continue selling well over the summer. Ekaterina told the Telegraph that despite her celebrity success she was still aiming higher with Madonna, Lady Gaga and Rhianna being her dream celebrities to dress. Bold and bright: The usually tamely dressed Sienna Miller is a fan of the Katsuit (left) but Mary Charteris is no stranger to prints . Festival fever: Actress Jamie Winstone paired her Katsuit with a metallic shirt and fringed jacket . It's true that festival fashion has become less about utility and more about trends with wellies taking a backseat what with Rita Ora's white fringed boots and Caroline Flack's red suede shoes being anything but sensible footwear for a mud bath. But there is still something about an all-in-one skin-tight jumpsuit and a muddy festival that doesn't quite marry. However Ekaterina insists that her designs are more than just a fashion statement. She told the Telegraph: 'You need to wear something very, very simple (at a festival) and something you can easily move around in. 'Our silhouettes are easy to take on and off, are sexy because they are body hugging and backless and have a very funky print. As we know Glastonbury is pretty messy, rain and mud are easily washed off.' Catsuits weren't the only unlikely trend to to make a return at Glastonbury. This year's festival saw the rebound of portable music as an accessory and we aren't talking about iPods! Remember the whacky eighties trend of lugging a boombox around on your shoulders? Well the new take is the same idea but with less shoulder cramp. Rita Ora, Nick Grimshaw and Laura Whitmore were all spotted wearing Beats Pill XL at this year's Glastonbury. It was acceptable in the 80s: Rita Ora (left) and Nick Grimshaw (right) were spotted blasting 80s tunes from their Beats Pills over the Glastonbury weekend . Rita refused to be parted with hers on day one of the festival and reportedly made her crew join her in a group sing-along to Blondie's Hanging on the Telephone. Nick Grimshaw created his own on-the-go party by stealing Rita's Pill to blair music from the VIP bar with pals including Sam Smith, Alexa Chung, Florence Welch and . Lily Allen. His playlist also included some 80s diamonds such as Prince's Controversy, we predict it's only a matter of time until Grimmy is spotted in rollerblades and leg warmers. The brightly coloured straps for the speakers came from a recent fashion collaboration between Dr Dre and iconic British fashion designer Henry Holland to create a summer accessory for the Beats Pill XL. To pimp up your Pill 80s style and in designer fashion you'll need to be happy to pay high-end prices with the straps coming in at £199. If you want to make your Pill portable you better be prepared to pay the premium price of £199 .

"The first major snowstorms of winter have dumped more than a foot of snow across parts of the Midwest, freezing hundreds of students out of their school classes and causing chaos on the roads. More than 500 crashes were reported Monday, as the worst-hit parts of states including Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas were coated with up to 16 inches of snow. It came as cold winds swept south over Colorado and Texas, sending temperatures plummeting by as much as 50 degrees in a few hours. The cold weather is part of a phenomenon known as the Omega Block, in which unusual weather patterns warp the jet stream and drag hot and cold air thousands of miles from where they would usually be. Scroll down for video . School chaos: Students across affected states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin were told to stay home from class Monday and Tuesday. But these kids, in St Paul, Minnesota, braved the winter snows on foot . Danger on the roads: Some 500 car crashes were reported in just Minnesota. This pick-up truck rolled over on the I-94 near Alexandria, Minnesota . Jackknife: This truck crashed on the US-63 route near Cumberland, Wisconsin. The Department for Transportation in the state reported visibility of less than 100 yards in some places . Colds to come: Snow will keep falling across the country, as temperatures tumble . Phenomenon: The cold weather is being brought in the the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, above in purple, which has dragged warmed air (in red) up and pushed cold air down. The pattern is known as an 'Omega Block' because the boundaries between hot and cold (in yellow above) look like a Greek letter omega . Weird weather: The above map shows everywhere except the West Coast can expect chilly temperatures - while Alaska will bask in comparative warmth . The epicenter of the phenomenon is the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which is causing areas of exceptionally low pressure over the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska. This has bent the jet stream, a barrier of wind which usually keeps hot and cold air separate, pulling warm air north and pushing cold air south. The pattern of pressures forms a bulge that resembles the Greek letter omega (Ω), and is therefore referred to as an Omega Block. Cold air which would usually sits near Canada has been pulled down as far as Texas, while warmer air from around the United States sails north. As the front approached, temperatures in Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri plunged from the 70s into the teens in a matter of hours. In Colorado, a huge dust storm accompanied the advancing front, and was pictured from above by an airplane passenger. The same phenomenon is warming up Alaska, with the result that, later this week, even the north of the region could be warmer than Dallas or Atlanta. Marching in: A frigid 'haboob' dust storm was sent blowing over Colorado by the advancing cold front, seen above from the window of a passenger plane . Transformation: These time-lapse photographs, taken just hours apart show winter sweeping over Boulder, Colorado . March of winter: The cold front is pushing across the United States, bringing chill winds and snow . Heading south: The cold weather brought low temperatures through the center of the country. Pictured in Omaha, Nebraska . Digging deep: Roads needed to be cleared out across the Midwest, including locales such as Duluth, Minnesota, pictured . The most visible effect of the cold air is over the Midwest, where snowstorms have pummeled Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, causing widespread chaos. Roads became treacherous and schools districts threw in the towel amid the flurries of snow, with dozens closing and scores more starting late today. In central Minnesota, Cambridge and St Augusta reported 16.5 inches of snow, while 15 fell in Starbuck and 13 in Kimball. Webster in northwest Wisconsin had 11 inches, upper Michigan had 9 and parts of North Dakota 8. Towards the Rockies, conditions were equally severe, with 14 inches of snow reported to the northwest of Montana. Colorado was also caught up in the storms, which are expected to keep coming and dump as much as 2 feet of snow in places. Drivers struggled to cope with the first blasts of wintry weather - in Minnesota alone 475 full crashes were reported yesterday, with 702 vehicles spinning out or ending up off the road. Overturned: A semi carrying live turkeys skidded off the road and landed upside-down on the side of the I-94 near Dalton, Minnesota. The driver was not badly hurt . Heavy shifting: Snow plows were put to work on the streets of Minneapolis . Winter is here: Snow hit Minnesota Monday morning, with more set to come. Pictured is the scene in Hopkins, a suburb of Minneapolis . The crashes resulted in 45 injuries - and one was fatal. In one incident, State Troopers had pulled over to help a jackknifed truck when a second truck slammed into them. Tuesday morning the Minnesota and Wisconsin departments of transport were reporting that huge swathes of their state still had dangerous, snow-covered roads, and were advising travelers to stay home. Students at schools across the states also got the call to stay home as many of their schools decided to close - though some unlucky students in St Cloud, Minnesota, took classes via the internet from their homes, KROCam.com reported. Terri Sommerfeld, a clerk at the Ace Hardware store in Webster, Wisconsin, said snow blowers are flying off the shelves. They usually sell six or seven of the machines each winter - but have sold that many in the last two days. Difficult: Cyclists, pedestrians and motorists are pictured navigating downtown Colorado Springs as storms hit . Frosty: A man makes his way through Mears Park in St Paul, Minnesota, on a chilly Monday . 'It hasn't been overly busy today, but the ones that are coming are buying snow blowers and shovels,' she said. Winter is officially still more than a month away, but it may not feel like it. The cold air coming with the snow will be around for a while, said Joe Calderone, a senior forecaster for the National Weather Service. Further south, temperatures plunged by as much as 50 degrees in a matter of hours as the arctic front pushed down. In the Texas Panhandle, cold swept temperatures in the 70s down to the high teens. Similar balmy weather in Missouri was replaced by temperatures in the 20s - dropping some 40 degrees overnight - along with a light dusting of snow. In parts of Colorado, temperatures fell into the teens - about 20 to 30 degrees below normal - and they're expected to remain through Thursday. Traffic: The I-35 freeway was held up while drivers took were challenged by the snowfall . In Minneapolis, even the first inch of snow tripled drive times. At one point, the weather turned to sleet, and tiny pellets stung uncovered faces and hands. Crews were plowing, shoveling or brushing off sidewalks, and snowplows did several loops around city streets. Even Christmas decorator Richard Anderson complained about the early snow. He said: 'As a professional holiday decorator you'd think I'd appreciate it. But I appreciate it when I'm all finished, and I'm finally sitting down and enjoying my own Christmas tree.' 'It's wet, cold, sticks to you. It's freezing on your jacket as it's raining. What do you call it? Rain, sleet and snow. And it's bitter. It's really bitter. It's not very nice.' 'It's part of being in South Dakota,' said Nancy Miller, a manager at Mid-America Travel Plaza in Belle Fourche. 'It's just the topic of the day. It's the first snowstorm of the season.' Wintry: These cyclists faced a significantly tougher commute than thanks to the flurries . In Chicago, some people were savoring breezy but mild weather near 60 before freezing temperatures arrive Wednesday. 'I just wanted to enjoy one of the last nice days,' said 44-year-old Joe Kauda, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Carol Stream and works in the mortgage industry. The wintry blast stirred fears of a repeat of last year's bitter season, when air from the polar vortex froze huge swathes of the country. But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration does not expect a repeat, and is predicting an average winter. This week's storm is part of a powerful system being pushed in by the remnants of Typhoon Nuri that hit Alaska's sparsely populated Aleutian Islands.

"Feeling fed up? Perhaps a blast of The Notorious BIG or Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five could help, Cambridge researchers say. They say that listening to hip hop can actually be beneficial to those suffering with depression. 'There is often a message of hope in amongst the lyrics, describing the place where they want to be – the cars they want to own, the models they want to date,' the researchers wrote. Researchers recommend The Message by Grandmaster Flash (pictured) & The Furious Five, released in 1982, which includes the lyrics: 'I can't take the smell, can't take the noise Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice' Researchers recommend The Message by Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, released in 1982, which includes the lyrics: 'I can't take the smell, can't take the noise Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice' They also cite Juicy by The Notorious BIG, which is 'dedicated to all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'' but details how he became successful. In an article in The Lancet Psychiatry, the team claims that lyrics which speak of overcoming hardships and struggles can offer refuge. 'Much of hip-hop comes from areas of great socioeconomic deprivation, so it's inevitable that its lyrics will reflect the issues faced by people brought up in these areas, including poverty, marginalisation, crime and drugs,' said Dr Akeem Sule, of the University of Cambridge. 'In fact, we can see in the lyrics many of the key risk factors for mental illness, from which it can be difficult to escape. 'Hip-hop artists use their skills and talents not only to describe the world they see, but also as a means of breaking free. 'We believe that hip-hop, with its rich, visual narrative style, can be used to make therapies that are more effective for specific populations and can help patients with depression to create more positive images of themselves, their situations and their future,' says Sule. 'It's been about forty years since hip-hop first began in the ghettos of New York City and it has come a long way since then, influencing areas as diverse as politics and technology,' said co-author Dr Becky Inkster Clinical Neuroscientist in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge. 'Now we hope to add medicine to the list.'

The team, hope to take their 'Hip Hop Psych' project into prisons, schools, and hostels to promote positive self-esteem through engagement with hip-hop artists. 'We've had an enormous response from the global community, from patients, prisoners, and parents to artists and fans alike,' says Inkster. 'We are overwhelmed and excited by requests from people around the world reaching out to us who want to help.

Its very mean of you to tell me these things that you told me just after marriage then you should have told me this before!!! 'I don't want an insecure man or a man that feelings doesn't (sic) come natural that you have to force yourself. 'Never expected things like that from you. Never expected things like that from you but now I want you to tell me exactly how u feel and honestly, u hurt me a lot by this and iam ready to pack and leave and this is not a joke! I can't even sleep at night.' Dewani, left, is on trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his new wife Anni, right, on their honeymoon . The correspondence was extracted from Dewani's phone by police a month after Mrs Dewani was killed in a township carjacking during her South African honeymoon, the Western Cape High Court heard. They were read into the record by Captain Paul Hendrickse whose investigation into the  bride's death concluded that her husband of two weeks was the mastermind of her cold-blooded murder. Dewani's emailed response to his wife's outpourings was handed to Judge Jeanette Traverso by defence barrister Francois van Zyl. In contrast to his wife's excitable tones, Dewani's reply was curt, rebutting her concerns in numerical order – number two being the most revealing. 'When I said it was not natural and was forcing myself – we were talking about not feeling happy. Not that I was forcing myself to be with you,' he wrote, nearly four hours after his wife's two-part screed. The accused took copious notes during the testimony of Captain Hendrickse . 'They are very different comments and seriously you cannot just take a meaning that you want. 'You need to listen to what I meant.' Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Zola Tongo to organise a fake carjacking as a cover for his wife's murder at the hands of two gunmen during their trip to Cape Town, exactly four years ago. Capt Hendrickse told the court he had been assigned to investigating Mrs Dewani's murder shortly after her body was discovered, with a fatal gun shot wound to her neck, in the back of Tongo's taxi. He formally interviewed Dewani 48 hours after he and Tongo had been freed unharmed from the ambush which claimed his wife's life and it was during that interview that the grieving husband's story began to unravel. Basic details from the first-hand account of the carjacking given to police by Dewani in the hours after the incident were then changed in his later statement, the court heard. Dewani told a new story about the location of the two gun men at the point they confronted the taxi carrying the newylweds, changed the number of guns the men were carrying and what valuables were stolen in the terrifying ordeal . In his first account to police, Dewani had described pleading for his bride's life in return for the weddings rings he handed over. The following morning, he had phoned Capt Hendrickse to tell him exactly where officers should look for his wife's £25,000 engagement ring - 'in the stitching' in one of the taxi's car seats, the court heard. The detective said he was'a bit confused because Dewani told me specifically where to find the ring, after he said [in his statement] that he gave the rings to the attackers.' After being confronted by the detective with the contradictory versions, Dewani 'became uneasy with the question and began pacing up and down my office and then gave me that explanation,' Capt Hendrickse said. The body language between Dewani and his family was noticeably tense as the policeman gave his testimony - during which Dewani took copious notes which he passed over the dock to his brother Preyen, who has sat with the defence team since the start of the trial last month. Capt Hendrickse told the court that by the time Tongo was in custody, Dewani had returned to England but kept in touch with the officer to check on the investigation's progress. During one call to the detective, he learned of Tongo's arrest. CCTV footage shows Dewani's reaction to the death of his wife . The vehicle where Anni's body was found. She had been shot in the neck . 'The accused was somewhat surprised that I had arrested the taxi driver,' the detective said. The following day, he was contacted by a lawyer, acting for Dewani, who wanted to know 'whether her client had been implicated in any way.' The policeman said that Dewani had failed to mention a number of vital facts during the hunt for his wife's killers, which would have entirely changed the direction of their inquiry. Most significantly, Dewani had not revealed that he had put R8,000 (£500) in his wife's bag before the couple had left on the night of the carjacking - or that it was payment for a surprise helicopter ride that he had asked Tongo to arrange. Dewani did not reveal to police that he had put R8,000 (£500) in his wife's bag before the couple had left on the night of the carjacking . It was only at the opening of his trial, that the helicopter trip was raised for the first time by Dewani as the cover for the secret meetings, phone calls and text messages between him and Tongo, and the cash the couple was carrying on the night of his wife's murder. 'If that explanation had been given to me, Mr Tongo would automatically have become a suspect,' Capt Hendrickse told the court. 'It would have created a motive for what transpired. I did not have any of those facts available. 'There would have been a motive for Tongo to have robbed Mr Dewani.' He dismissed Dewani's explanation as 'a newly-fabricated story'. After the lunch break, during cross-examination Mr van Zyl revealed that he had spoken to Tanya Lochner, the lawyer first instructed by Dewani in the wake of Tongo's arrest. The barrister put it to Capt Hendrickse that he had told Ms Lochner outside an earlier hearing dealing with the cases of Tongo and hit man Mziwamadoda Qwabe, that Mrs Dewani had been shot in error. 'She told me that you said they [hitmen] did not mean to shoot her. They only shot her because she wouldn't stop screaming,' Mr van Zyl said to the officer, who said he could not recall the exchange. Mr van Zyl also summed up his client's contribution to the fiery email exchange as, 'Shrien says he loves Anni', referring to bullet point number three of his e-mail. 'I love you. You know that. Surely this is the most important thing. The rest will just come,' it read. Intriguingly, the two-page print out of the correspondence revealed that it was an innocuous – if impersonal – message from Dewani, which was obviously followed by a more intimate confession in person - that triggered her fervent reply. In a stark list – under the subject: Things to get ready – Dewani offers his wife of five days a list of six items to pack – five of them electronic. Passports, your laptop, laptop charger, camera, camera charger, camera memory card. Mr van Zyl told the court: 'The accused will say that they had a discussion when they were in a hotel in Bristol. He said how he felt and she didn't like it.' Dewani denies five charges including murder and robbery. The trial continues.","Murder victim threatened to walk out just five days after they married .

"A grandmother, three grandchildren and the children's mother died early Tuesday in a house fire, New Orleans firefighters said. Fire Chief Timothy McConnell said the fire was reported around 12:15am Tuesday at the yellow, two-story home in the city's Broadmoor neighborhood. McConnell said first responders on the scene found the house engulfed in flames. He said the children's father, Derrick Anderson, tried to re-enter the house to rescue the family, but the flames blocked his way. He was not injured. Tragic: New Orleans firefighters say a grandmother, three grandchildren and the children's mother died in the two-story house fire - there was no smoke detector in the home . Firefighters said Anderson identified himself as the mother's boyfriend and said the house did not have smoke detectors. Officials identified the victims as Martha Anderson, 77, and her grandchildren, Jade Anderson, 12; Jason Anderson, 11; and Jayla Anderson, even. The mother was identified as 33-year-old Christina Squire. Outside the charred house, Derrick Anderson's brother, 51-year-old Frederick Anderson, said he lost his mother, two nieces and a nephew. Frederick Anderson said he lived in the house but was away at the time of the fire. He arrived to find investigators at the scene. 'I saw the ambulance here. And it was pretty much a done deal.' McConnell said the grandmother's body was found in a first-floor bedroom and the mother and children were found in a second-floor bedroom. Fire Department spokesman Michael Williams said it appears the fire started on the first floor in the rear of the home. Roaring blaze: Fire Department spokesman Michael Williams said it appears the fire started on the first floor in the rear of the home . Team effort: It took firefighters about an hour and a half to bring the fire under control . Williams said it took firefighters about an hour and a half to bring the fire under control. The fire gutted much of the corner-lot house near the Andrew H. Wilson Charter School where McConnell said the three children attended school. David Winkler-Schmit, president of the association that runs the school, said the school community was in shock. 'The staff, the principal are just crushed,' Winkler-Schmit said as he stood outside the school building. 'The family has live in the Broadmoor neighborhood for over 40 years. The dad went to Wilson. The kids went to Wilson. They were good kids.' Broadmoor is a racially, mixed working-class area that was hit hard by flooding from Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. It has recovered, but signs of post-storm blight remain. One nearby house is shuttered, its roof collapsing. Investigators with the state fire marshal's office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are assisting in the investigation, but firefighters said the cause did not appear to be of suspicious origin.","A grandmother, three grandchildren - aged seven to 12 - and the children's mother died early Tuesday in a house fire in the Broadmoor neighborhood .

"Eugenie Bouchard has taken to Twitter to show her appreciation for her time at Wimbledon a day after the Canadian's straight-sets loss in the women's final to Petra Kvitova. Bouchard, despite the backing of the Centre Court faithful, could do little to stop the terrifyingly good Kvitova, who took just 55 minutes to win 6-3, 6-0.

"A former RAF control tower at the site where bomber pilots were trained during the Second World War as well as those taking part in the infamous Dambusters mission has been put up for sale for £300,000. The four-storey 40ft  structure comes complete with military ancillary buildings at the former RAF Wainfleet base in Friskney, Lincolnshire. However obtaining a slice of military history comes with a warning because visitors to the area are still warned about the danger of unexploded bombs nearby on the former training range. Scroll down for video . The RAF control tower on the site where Dam Busters were trained, is to be sold at auction this month and has a guide price of £300,000 . But estate agents, acting for the private seller, have confirmed that the risk of any unexploded bombs should not affect buyers, as missions generally took place over the wash, which goes in to the nearby sea and can be seen from the control tower. For more than a century, members of the Armed Forces would hone their firing skills on the site of RAF Wainfleet which was used as a bombing range for pilots from just before the start of the Second World War. It was also used as a training ground for the famous Dambusters mission where the air force developed bouncing bombs that were used to successfully breach dams in Germany. The mission became so famous it has been made the subject of books and a film. The historic air base dates back to the 1920s. The tower was built in the 1970s. After the site was closed in 2010  the equipment was removed from the seven-sided observation tower, which used to function as a weapons range. The RAF Wainfleet website contains the warning: 'Although there is no risk from aircraft dropping bombs, there remains a significant risk from unexploded ordnance that may be exposed by the tides. Do not touch anything!!' The RAF has previously warned about the danger of unexploded ordnance at the site, but there is only believed to be a risk in the wash . The control tower, which is over four storeys, boasts views of the countryside and the sea as well as the five bedrooms inside . However potential customers are being told that they are unlikely to be at risk as the bombing range was over the wash, which goes out to sea. The tower itself is now surrounded by farmed fields. The control tower, built in the 1970s, is spread over four storeys and boasts a kitchen, toilet, three lobbies and landings, and five other rooms, as well as the top floor observatory. It comes with a sea view and also has a balcony and its own flag pole. The tower is located close to the coast, between Boston and Skegness. The marshy area around the base was first used by the military as for cannon and musket practice during the Napoleanic Wars of the early 1800s. The control tower is one the site where bomber pilots during the Second World War were trained and is located close to the coast . The control tower boasts panoramic views of the countryside, pictured, and is surrounded by marshy land where bombers trained . The Dam Busters managed to successfully attack Eder Dam, one of two dams which caused widespread destruction in Germany . The control tower lies on the site where the Dambusters underwent their training, later told in the 1955 film of the same name . The tower comes with additional buildings - two have their own kitchen and toilet, and the workshop is steel clad with a roller shutter door. The five buildings were once used as a kitchen, rest room, gym, offices, workshop as well as a generator and oil tank. Sellers say the former RAF weapons range, valued at £300,000, could be transformed into luxury  accommodation by its new owner in a Grand Designs-style makeover. Bagshaws Residential estate agents will be auctioning off the property at Derbyshire County Cricket Club on November 26. Simon Gillibrand, an auction partner at Bagshaws Residential, said: 'The views from the top floor are absolutely brilliant. You could have a wonderful lounge up there. 'I have been selling properties for over 30 years and I have never seen anything like this. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone. 'It's only been on the market for two or three weeks, but it has already had quite a lot of interest and the views from it are just stunning. The last remaining operational Lancaster in Europe is pictured flies over the Dewent dam to celebrate the 70th anniversary last year . The last remaining Lancaster performed a historic flypass over the Derwent and Ladybower dam as part of the anniversary event . The mission became so well known it was developed into a successful film in 1955, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd . The Dambusters mission, which saw two dams in Germany breached and 1,600 people drowned, was made the subject of a film . The 1955 film revealed the level of training Dambusters had to undergo for the mission, which has also been marked in a book . 'This could end up being a bit of a Grand Designs property. 'Of course it will be up to the buyer to do what they want with the tower but it really is a unique property and a chance of owning a slice of British military history.' It has been given a guide price of between £300,000 to £350,000 on property listings website Rightmove. The listing on Rightmove.com describes the property as 'truly spectacular' with 'stunning views to all sides'. It adds: 'Can only describe this rarest of opportunities to purchase the former RAF control tower and ancillary buildings and car park at Sea Lane, Friskney. 'Access over a private lane passing agricultural land opens onto the control tower which dominates the skyline. 'The secure compound surrounds this former bombing range control tower and ancillary buildings.' RAF 617 Squadron was formed during the Second World War specifically to carry out 'bouncing bomb' attacks to breach dams in the industrial heartlands of Nazi Germany. Between May 16-17 1943  the squadron targeted German dams with the bouncing bombs, becoming known as the Dam Busters. Pilots risked their lives by flying across occupied Europe at night, so low that some were killed by power lines. The mission required precision and bravery as pilots were required to fly at just 60ft above the ground - compared to the normal 250ft planes must fly at now. They had to drop untried bouncing bombs – with unprecedented accuracy – in full view of the enemy’s guns. During this attack the Mohne and Edersee dams were breached, causing flooding of the Ruhr valley and villages in the Eder valley in Germany. Pilots also targeted the Sorpe dam but this did not collapse. Factories and mines were destroyed and an estimated 1,600 people drowned. Two hydroelectric power stations were also damaged. The operation was planned in secrecy and known as Chastise. It came at a great cost as 19 planes were lost, and 53 of the 133 men died in the raid . Barnes Wallis, an English scientist, inventor and engineer invented the bouncing bomb . The Dam Busters became so notorious it led to a book and film being produced in 1955, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd. The film Dambusters aimed to capture the action of Operation Chastise, which successfully breached two dams in Nazi Germany .","Former RAF control tower on site where pilots including the Dambusters were trained is to be sold at auction .

"Caked in mud and tethered by rope in the tiny yard of a rundown farm, this is one of tens of thousands of horses that face slaughter in Romania every year for their meat. Once seven-year-old mare Sabarel can no longer carry out the demanding work of a draught horse she will be sold to the abattoir down the road. On the days when she is not pulling a wooden cart laden with heavy farm equipment or produce, she is tied up inside a dark, mud-walled stable, chewing hay from the manger that hangs on the wall. Work horse: Farmer Ion with Sabarel, the seven-year-old mare that will be slaughtered for meat when she can no longer do the demanding work of a draught horse . Next door, a sow nurses her litter of six piglets, while chickens, ducks and turkeys roam around the muddy yard. Dogs, tied to their ramshackle kennels, bark constantly. Like the pigs and poultry around her, Sabarel will end up facing the butcher’s knife. Her mother was taken away and slaughtered when she grew too old to be of use two years ago. And it is horses just like these which have ended up on the shelves of British supermarkets in a food scandal that seems to deepen by the day. Romanian president Traian Basescu said Romania would suffer economically if it was found to have some responsibility for the growing scandal . Yesterday Sabarel’s owner told how . the harsh reality of rural life in Romania left no room for . sentimentality. Standing in the farmyard as the temperature sank to . freezing point, Ion, a 45-year-old farmer from the village of Teiser, . told the Daily Mail: ‘I used to have two horses – a mother and her foal. ‘But when the mother got too old I sold it to some gipsies who were passing by. ‘There is an abattoir down the road. This is where old horses end up.’ He added: ‘This horse is called Sabarel. She is seven years old and a mare. She has quite a bad temper. She is used to pull the cart – carrying produce and equipment around the farm.’ A horse fetches around £100 when sold for meat in Romania – often much less. Some 30 miles from Ion’s farm is the huge Cicalex abattoir. A banner brandishing an image of two red meat steaks is stretched across the main road leading to the plant in the outskirts of Alexandria, 50 miles from Bucharest. The sprawling industrial site is one of Romania’s biggest abattoirs, exporting thousands of tons of meat – including horsemeat – to countries across Europe, including France. Founded in 1976, Cicalex is one of only 25 abattoirs in Romania to slaughter horses commercially. The firm supplies catering firms with . fresh horsemeat, salamis and sausages made from horse meat and frozen . horse meat. While Romanians are increasingly reluctant to eat horsemeat . themselves, the country still produces huge quantities – some 14,000 . tons each year – mainly for export.

"Crusading journalist Don Hale said officers from Special Branch seized documents naming MPs and peers with links to a paedophile group . Police are investigating whether Special Branch officers confiscated documents naming 16 MPs and peers with links to a paedophile group. Campaigners fear they may have been destroyed in an establishment cover-up involving the predatory paedophile Cyril Smith – along with the missing ‘Dickens dossier’. Theresa May announced the Metropolitan Police will investigate what happened to a file passed to award-winning journalist Don Hale by the late Labour minister Barbara Castle. It allegedly included the identities of senior politicians who were actively promoting the Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise sex with children in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr Hale said he was approached in the 1980s by Baroness Castle, who wanted him to investigate Westminster’s links to PIE. Over a series of meetings, Lady Castle handed him a series of ‘extraordinary’ papers containing a list of 16 MPs and peers ‘allegedly involved in promoting the PIE network’, he told the BBC. Mr Hale said that, after contacting the Home Office and some of the Parliamentarians on the list, he was visited by the Liberal MP Cyril Smith who, since his death, has been unmasked as a serial abuser of young boys. Mr Hale said of Smith: ‘Suddenly he turned from Mr Nice Guy into Mr Nasty. He was very threatening and demanded I hand over all the documents to him immediately.’ He said that when he refused, Smith stormed out. Mr Hale said he was then visited the next day by officers from Special Branch citing ‘national security’ who threw him against a wall and took the documents. The papers have not been seen since. Mr Hale believes the files may have been even more important than those compiled by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens, which have also disappeared. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the allegations are ‘clearly immensely serious’. She added: ‘They must be investigated by someone.’ However, her party colleague John Mann questioned whether the Met was the right body to carry out the investigation, given its links to Special Branch. Theresa May (pictured) announced the Metropolitan Police will investigate what happened to a file passed to award-winning journalist Don Hale by the late Labour minister Barbara Castle . Lady Castle, who died in 2002, is thought to have put together 30 pages of information about alleged attempts by the PIE to infiltrate government. As well as key members of the Commons and Lords, she found about 30 prominent businessmen, public school teachers, scoutmasters and police officers had links to PIE. Mr Hale went on to be a campaigning editor at the Matlock Mercury newspaper, known for the investigation that led to the freeing of Stephen Downing, wrongly jailed for the ‘Bakewell Tart’ murder. In addition to his explosive claims, yesterday saw Mrs May come under more pressure to make progress in finding a new head for a wide-ranging inquiry into historic sex abuse. Labour MPs are promoting human rights barrister Michael Mansfield QC’s case to be the new chairman, following the resignation of Fiona Woolf. Campaigners fear the file may have been destroyed in an establishment cover-up involving the predatory paedophile Cyril Smith (pictured) The National Association for People Abused in Childhood has also said it would support Mr Mansfield. However, one possible problem is that, in the late Seventies, Mr Mansfield had ties to the National Council for Civil Liberties, which granted the PIE ‘affiliate member’ status. In 1978, he attended an NCCL meeting alongside Labour’s Harriet Harman, who has herself attracted huge controversy over the NCCL’s ties to PIE. Mr Mann told Mrs May that Special Branch should be ‘invited to the inquiry in order [to] give their explanation of why they were instructed to take [Mr Hale’s] files ... and where they took them’.","Campaigners fear documents were destroyed in cover-up involving predatory paedophile Cyril Smith .

"Pill-making machines and a pair of glasses thought to have belonged to notorious poisoner Dr Crippen are to go under the hammer next week. Northamptonshire-based auction house JP Humbert is also offering poison bottles recovered from the workplace of Hawley Harvey Crippen, who was hanged at London's Pentonville Prison in 1910 for murdering his wife, Cora. A brooch thought to have been owned by Cora is also on sale at the auction in Towcester on Wednesday November 19. Dr Hawley Crippen, left was hanged in Pentonville Prison London in 1910 after he murdered his wife Cora, right . Dr Crippen was a homeopathic doctor who made his fortune selling pills and potions containing nothing more than just sugar and alcohol although he was found guilty of killing his wife with the deadly  poison hyoscine . Crippen, who was born in the United States, is believed to have used hyoscine to kill Cora at his London home before attempting to flee to Canada. Commenting ahead of the sale, auctioneer Jonathan Humbert predicted that the lots may emulate the success of other recently-sold items linked to well-known criminal names. Mr Humbert said: 'The items were removed from Crippen's work address at Albion House, New Oxford Street, where he was medical advisor to a dental practice.' 'Whilst crime doesn't pay, people are paying large sums of money for crime-related items.' As well as the artifacts believed to have been owned by Dr Crippen, copies of the New York Times and Los Angeles Express covering the story are also going up for sale. Mr Humbert added: 'The items were removed from Crippen's work address at Albion House, New Oxford Street, London where he was medical advisor to a dental practise and latterly a franchisee of Munyons. 'It was here that he ordered five grains of the poison Hyoscine from a nearby chemist.' The items, believed to have been owned by Dr Crippen were recovered from his London work address. Investigators recovered  headless corpse from a shallow grave inside Dr Crippen's basement, but DNA evidence has since proved it was a man . American born Dr Harvey Crippen moved to Holloway in north London with his second wife Cora. She disappeared following a party at the couple's house in January 1910. Friends of Mrs Crippen became suspicious after seeing Crippen's mistress, who moved into the house, wearing her clothes and jewellery. An initial search by Scotland Yard found no evidence of any foul play, however, Dr Crippen fled with his mistress to Canada. After he disappeared, Scotland Yard conducted three further searches of the property where they recovered human remains. Crippen and his mistress were travelling on the SS Montrose when the captain of the vessel, who was keeping up-to-date with the news on the newly installed wireless, telegraphed Scotland Yard. Crippen's mistress, Ethel Le Neve, was travelling disguised as a young boy. An inspected boarded a faster vessel and raced Crippen across the Atlantic, arresting him upon his arrival in Canada. Had he boarded a vessel to New York, he would have probably escaped punishment. Crippen was returned to the Old Bailey where he was found guilty of murder after less than 30 minutes and hanged in Pentonville Prison in Novembe 1910. The human remains recovered by Scotland Yard were badly decomposed and more than 100 years after their recovery, it is believed that the bones belonged to a man. Attempts have been made by distant relatives of Dr Crippen to exonerate him, however his body remains inside the walls of Pentonville Prison. A study reported in the Journal of Forensic Science in America by scientist David Foran said: 'Based on genealogical and DNA research, the tissue used to convict Dr Crippen was not that of Cora. ‘Further DNA testing showed the tissue was male. All we can say scientifically is, the tissue did not come from Cora. ‘One possibility is that Crippen murdered someone else and those were the remains discovered. Another possibility is that the celebrated investigators planted the evidence.’ Among the items for sale is a brooch believed to have been owned by his murdered wife Cora . Several unusual artifacts believed to have been owned by Dr Crippen are being sold by auction . Among the items for sale are some original US newspapers covering the story from July 1910 . Dr Crippen made his fortune as a homeopath selling pills and potions to gullible patients .","Harvey Crippen was found guilty of murdering his wife Cora in 1910 .

"Billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen has been unmasked as the secret lone bidder who shelled out $101million for a sculpture by Alberto Giacometti at a New York City auction last week. Sources familiar with the details of the sale told local media outlets, among them Page Six, that Cohen, the founder of the now-defunct investment firm SAC Capital Advisors, scooped up the masterpiece titled 'Chariot' last Tuesday at Sotheby's impressionist and modern art sale. The rare 1951 bronze sculpture, one of only six created by Giacometti, features an elongated goddess-like figure perched atop a wheeled chariot. Billionaire's newest toy: Hedge fund manager Steve cohen (left) reportedly bought Alberto Giacometti's 'Chariot' sculpture (right) for $101million at auction November 4 . Stunner: The rare 1951 bronze sculpture, one of only six created by Giacometti, features an elongated goddess-like figure perched atop a wheeled chariot . The sculpture had been in the collection of Alexander Goulandris, a Greek shipping magnate, since 1972 . The price paid by Cohen was just shy of breaking the $104.3million record for the Swiss artist. The sculpture had been in the collection of Alexander Goulandris, a Greek shipping magnate, since 1972. Mr Cohen's big-ticket purchase comes a year after he was forced to pay record-setting $1.8billion to settle criminal insider trading charges. The scandal led to the closing of SAC Capital, but Cohen has since opened a new outfit called Point72 Asset Management, which mostly handles the billionaire's own fortune. The family firm has posted impressive gains of 15 per cent as of the end of last month. Cohen, 58, is widely considered to be one of the most successful hedge fund managers of all times. Defunct: Cohen's highly successful SAC Capital hedge fund was forced to pay record-setting $1.8billion to settle criminal insider trading charges last year. The firm has since closed down . House worthy of a king: Steve Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, reside in a palatial compound sitting on more than 18 acres of land in tony Greenwich, Connecticut . Pleasuredome: The estate comes with a 35,000-square-foot main house, a full-size indoor basketball court, a 6,700-square-foot ice skating rink, and even a small golf course . With a personal net worth of $10.3billion at his disposal, he has been heavily investing in art, amassing one of the most remarkable collections in the US valued at over $1billion. Ms Cohen's legal complications evidently have done nothing to curb his appetite for masterpieces. While SAC Capital was being investigated for insider trading by the US Department of Justice in 2012, Mr Cohen paid Las Vegas casino tycoon Steve Wynn $155million for Pablo Picasso's La Reve. The painting had to undergo restoration following a notorious 2006 mishap in which Mr Wynn accidentally put his elbow through the canvass, opening a six-inch gash, just before it was set to be shipped to Cohen. Steve Cohen, who is married and lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, also owns a Jackson Pollack and Damien Hirst's 1991 famed shark sculpture, which he purchased a decade ago for $8million, according to multiple reports. The large-scale work featuring a tiger shark in formaldehyde had been on loan until 2010 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 2012, it was sent to the Tate Modern in London for a Hirst exhibit. A number of Cohen’s artworks are expected to go on the auction block at Christy’s this week, among them an Andy Warhol piece. According to his profile at Forbes Magazine, Cohen, the son of a dressmaker from Manhattan’s garment district, launched his career in finance with $7,000 that was supposed to go towards his tuition at Wharton School.

"Robert O'Neill, the former Navy SEAL who claims he killed Osama bin Laden says the government had no intention of bringing back the al-Qaeda chief alive and Navy SEAL Team Six believed they were on a suicide mission. 'The more we trained on it the more we realized this is going to be a one-way mission,' said O'Neill in the first clips of his eagerly anticipated interview with Fox News which will air tonight on Veterans Day. 'We’re going to go and we’re not going to come back. We’re going to die when the house blows up, we’re going to die when he blows up, or we’re going to be there too long, we get arrested by the Pakistanis, and we’re going to spend the rest of our lives in a Pakistan prison.' Dramatic: Robert O'Neill will give his version of events to Fox News on Tuesday night during the networks 'The Man who killed Osama bin Laden' special . Appearing on the Fox News Special, 'The Man who killed Osama bin Laden', O'Neill describes how he got the fatal kill shot in first and ended the life of the world's most wanted man. While O'Neill admits that two others fired shots at the terror leader, this is the first time that O'Neill has been seen interviewed on camera about the now legendary May, 2011 raid. He has faced severe criticism for coming forward so publicly, especially after he gave an anonymous account of the raid last year to Esquire magazine in which he was indentified only as 'The Shooter'. Rear Admiral Brian Losey, the commander of the Naval Special Warfare Group urged SEALs to regain their low profile. 'At Naval Special Warfare's core is the SEAL ethos,' an October 31 letter said. 'A critical tenant of our ethos is 'I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.' What's done is done: Bin Laden shooter Robert O'Neill (above) said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure' Under fire: This comes as many are attacking O'Neill for making his identity as a Navy SEAL public . Robert O'Neill, who was unmasked last week by MailOnline as 'The Shooter', had been trained to use two head shots during missions - known in military circles as a double tap. However, according to the New York Post, he told families of 9/11 victims there was 'no harm in putting one more bullet in him.' According to the paper, he made the comments during a secret meeting at the memorial museum at the World Trade Center site in July. Describing the night of the raid, he said that he didn't know who 'The Target' was going into the mission. Before his unit set off, he had time to make one, last phone call to his children, fearing he may never see them again. He recalled how he climbed into bin Laden's compound, walked upstairs and heard. His weapon then went: 'Pop! Pop! Pop!' The audience, all relatives of people who died in the attacks on the Twin Towers had no idea they would be receiving a first hand account of how the mastermind was killed. Initially they were invited to a 'private and confidential' event that included a talk by a 'mystery speaker'. Last week, following his first televised interview, he said: 'He (Bin Laden] died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure.' Down: O'Neill says of what happened, that anyone who questions him can only ask one other person what really happened, Osama bin Laden (above), and he's dead . O'Neill  opened up about his meeting with the relatives of the 9/11 terror attacks saying: '[O]ne thing I tell them is all right, Osama bin Laden died like a p****.That's all I'm telling you. Just so you know.' This was all revealed in a series of recorded interviews O'Neill had with journalist Alex Quade that were aired on Friday's AC360. He added that it doesn't matter who ultimately took down the terrorist. 'The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am The Shooter,' O'Neill said. 'Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.' Site: O'Neill also revealed that he and his fellow Navy SEALs did not think they would return alive after the raid on bin Laden's hideout (above) He also revealed in these interviews that he and his fellow SEALs did not think they would make it out alive after raiding bin Laden's hideout. 'Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,' O'Neill said of their acknowledgement that this would likely be the end for them. '(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.' O'Neill's move to go public has been met with mixed response, and heavily criticzed among his fellow SEALs. He sees it differently however, pointing out how films like Captain Phillips and Zero Dark Thirty both made his work very public, and that high ranking officials have no spoken openly about both incidents. 'Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,' he said. 'I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.' Public guy: O'Neill seems fine with his detractors these days in interviews, saying he doesn't care if people think he is 'full of s***' As for those who question him, he is not letting it bother him. 'Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,' he said. 'You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.' O'Neill is due to appear in a two-part documentary on Fox News next week, detailing his part in the killing of bin Laden. MailOnline exclusively disclosed his identity ahead of the broadcast. O’Neill has already described the night of May 2, 2011 in an interview with Sharon Stone’s ex-husband Phil Bronstein that appeared in Esquire magazine in February 2013. But his name was not revealed at that time and he was referred to only as ‘the Shooter.’ Now his identity has become public, military leaders and fellow SEALs are lining up to discredit his version of events. Donation: O'Neill gave his SEAL team uniform the museum at the memorial to the September 11 terror attacks in New York after meeting relatives of the victims of bin Laden's atrocity. It was then that he decided to tell the wider public that he was 'The Shooter' Speaking success: O'Neill is now a high-profile member of the motivational speaking circuit, openly revealing that he was a SEAL - but until now not declaring that he was involved in the daring raid which killed bin Laden . A former SEAL Team 6 commander told the New York Times O’Neill only fired ‘insurance shots’ into bin Laden’s twitching body after the terror leader had already been mortally shot by an unidentified SEAL who is still in the service. That hero is described as the ’point man’ who led the SEALs up the stairs in bin Laden’s compound to the bedroom where he was hiding. Another Team 6 member also disputed O’Neill’s version, saying the 'point man' had wounded bin Laden with a shot to the side, and then grabbed the women in the room for fear they were wearing explosives. O’Neill, he said, had then finished Osama off. And Reuters quoted an unidentified source close to a SEAL Team 6 member as saying the fatal shot was fired by one of two other men who entered the room before O'Neill. But O’Neill told Bronstein last year: ‘I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! same place. That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.’ One SEAL source told MailOnline: 'The real shooter would never discuss it publicly. 'Members of SEAL Team Six haven’t discussed it publicly so there’s a reasonable chance he’s not being truthful. 'There is no way O’Neill could really prove it was he who took the fatal shot on Osama bin Laden unless his comrades all attested to it. 'But again, the code of secrecy with these special operators would preclude that.'","Much-anticipated Fox News special with Robert O'Neill to air on Tuesday .

"The oldest person to climb Mount Everest today announced that he will not make any further attempts to scale the world's highest peak - even though his new record may soon be in jeopardy. Yuichiro Miura, who reached the 29,035ft (8,850m) peak at the age of 80 on Thursday, said: 'I think three times is enough. 'At this point I could not think of anything but rest.' Yuichiro Miura waves as he arrives in Kathmandu after he became the oldest person to conquer Everest. He said the climb will be his last . Miura said he will try again despite his rival Min Bahadur Sherchan planning to beat his record . Miura was meant to leave the mountain yesterday but only left today because of poor weather . However, Miura's record may be short-lived as his 81-year-old rival, Nepalese climber Min Bahadur Sherchan, is preparing to climb Everest and is at base camp. Sherchan held the record for five years until Miura's climb last week. Miura was only able to leave the mountain today - a day later than planned - because of poor weather conditions. The Japanese former extreme skier, who today flew to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, said of his rival: 'I hope his success is good news. I wish him best of luck.' Miura, however, insisted that Sherchan . back up any claim of scaling Everest's peak with clear photographs of . the climber showing his face at the summit. Miura had climbed Everest in May 2008 at age 75, but Sherchan did the same a day earlier at 76. The Japanese climber  conquered the mountain again on Thursday, alongside his son Gota, 43. His feat is even more remarkable as he underwent heart surgery in January for an irregular heartbeat, . his fourth heart operation since 2007.

He skied down Everest's South Col in 1970, using a parachute to break his descent, which was captured in the Oscar-winning 1975 documentary, 'The Man Who Skied Down Everest.' He has also skied down Mount Fuji. It was not until Miura was 70, however, that he first climbed to the top of Everest. When he reached the summit again at the age of 75, he claimed to be the only man to accomplish the feat twice in his 70s. After that, he said he was determined to climb again at age 80.

"Ronnie O'Sullivan started his UK Championship campaign against Daniel Wells on one leg but will withdraw from the tournament if he feels no let-up from his broken ankle by the weekend. The Rocket beat plucky amateur Daniel Wells 6-2 at York's Barbican Centre, coming through after a tricky first half of the match. It has often been said that the five-time world champion could win a snooker match with all manner of handicaps enforced, and playing on a broken left ankle after a fall while running backs that up. Ronnie O'Sullivan was clearly in during his first round match at the UK Championship . But for all the admirable courage shown, O'Sullivan admitted afterwards he will not start Sunday's second-round match against Leeds veteran Peter Lines or Northern Ireland's Joe Swail if he has felt no improvements. 'The injury is disappointing, a broken ankle. It is not too comfortable and I didn't enjoy any of that,' the 38-year-old said at his post-match press conference. 'I thought I would give it a go but if it doesn't improve I'm not sure I'm going to play my next match. 'I can't get on the shot properly, I'm hobbling around, it's swelling up and it's painful. 'I've taken all the painkillers, done all I can do, and if it's not better by Sunday I probably won't play.' The Rocket beat plucky amateur Daniel Wells 6-2 at York's Barbican Centre on Thursday . A withdrawal from the sport's most popular player would be a severe blow for the tournament but would, even at such an early stage, open the field up. O'Sullivan has looked near-unbeatable since his return to the main tour after a self-imposed year-long exile, and he was a short-priced favourite to win a fifth UK title. The Essex man has cited running as one of the key reasons why he has finally beaten the mental troubles that plagued his career. He revealed in his recent autobiography, entitled 'Running', that he had contemplated quitting snooker all together and dedicating himself to athletics. Now, though, he says he is going to put the trainers away until he retires. 'I am absolutely gutted. I am enjoying my snooker more than ever and to do that through running - I am really angry with myself,' he said. 'I am so annoyed at myself. I think I will probably stop running now until the end of my snooker career because you can't do this. O'Sullivan gets on a shot against Wells but broken ankle could force him to pull out of tournament . O'Sullivan tweeted picture of his broken left ankle on Tuesday . 'It's the third time I have broken my foot. I fell over in the forest. I was running with my mate and he'd asked me what time I was doing on the run. I looked at my watch and I just lost my footing and I slipped. 'That was it. Partly his fault, partly my fault and I am frustrated with myself because I am a snooker player, not a runner. I just shouldn't do it. It is really frustrating.' O'Sullivan was not the only walking wounded at York, with two-time world champion Mark Williams beating Steven Hallworth 6-1 despite a muscle injury picked up during weight training. Jack Lisowski also won by that scoreline against Chris Melling. Elsewhere, 1997 world winner Ken Doherty beat Mitchell Mann, Marco Fu avoided a shock loss to Ahmed Saif while Mark Davis, Liam Highfield, Luca Brecel, Robin Hull and Jimmy Robertson also progressed. In Thursday’s evening session, defending champion Neil Robertson waltzed through 6-0 against Joe O'Connor, while Stephen Maguire beat Lu Ning 6-2.

"Infection control: Doctors wash their hands less often as they get more tired, meaning there is greater risk of spreading infection, a study warns . Doctors and nurses wash their hands less often as their shift progresses, increasing the risk they will spread infections among their patients, a study warns. The demands placed on medics and carers by long shifts drained their mental reserves and led to them washing their hands less often as their days wore on, researchers found. Tired and busy staff concentrate on their medical duties and see hand hygiene as a 'low priority'. And the more stress and workload, the less compliance with the rules. Despite strict guidelines to stop bugs spreading, one in 16 people treated in an NHS hospital picks up an infection such as MRSA, according to the latest figures from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Hengchen Dai, of the University of Pennsylvania, said: 'Just as the repeated exercise of muscles leads to physical fatigue, repeated use of executive resources produces a decline in an individual's self-regulatory capacity. 'Demanding jobs have the potential to energise employees, but the pressure may make them focus more on maintaining performance on their primary tasks, for example, patient assessment and medication distribution, particularly when they are fatigued. 'For hospital caregivers, hand-washing may be viewed as a lower-priority task and thus it appears compliance with hand hygiene guidelines suffers as the workday progresses.' Mr Dai and his team looked at three years of hand-washing data from 4,157 caregivers in 35 U.S. hospitals. In the study published by the American Psychologican Association, nurses accounted for 65 per cent of the sample, nursing assistants 12 per cent, therapists 7 per cent, doctors 4 per cent and the rest other hospital workers. It found compliance with handwashing rules dropped by an average of 8.7 per cent during a typical 12-hour shift. However if longer breaks broke up the shift hand-washing protocols were followed more carefully on when staff returned.

A previous study in Switzerland has shown hand-washing in hospitals can reduce infections by 3.9 per 1,000 patients. Another shows the cost per patient with a healthcare-acquired infection is £12,966. Through using this data, the researchers concluded that there would be an additional 600,000 infections per year at a cost of approximately £12.5billion annually to U.S. hospitals alone. The human hand harbours more harmful bacteria than public surfaces, a recent study found. Researchers found the average pair of human hands is more unhygienic than escalators and benches in busy shopping centres and parks. Yet only one in eight people always wash their hands before eating, the study shows. The average person carries more than 10 million bacteria on the hands alone and a University of Arizona study found a typical kitchen sponge will contain several million. Under NHS guidelines introduced to all clinical staff, they should clean their hands thoroughly with either soap and water or an alcohol-based handrub, both immediately before and immediately after coming into contact with a patient - even after wearing gloves. NICE said hand hygiene in NHS hospitals has improved in recent years but good practice is still not universal. Co-researcher Dr Katherine Milkman, said: 'We believe ours is the first study investigating whether accumulated work demands can affect rule compliance over the course of a single workday, as opposed to over weeks, months or years. 'We think this line of research could be applied to other types of workplace compliance, such as ethics standards in banking, safe driving behaviours in trucking and safety standards in manufacturing.'","Tired staff focus on medical duties and see hand hygiene as a 'low priority'

"Ever wondered just how much we spend on make-up over our lifetime, or how much star power really affects the way we shop? A new infographic reveals just that, showcasing a collection of research from dozens of British surveys into women's and men's grooming habits. Looking at the most iconic products of all time and ranking the importance of celebrity endorsements - the results might surprise you. Beauty facts: Feel Unique commissioned the cool and quirky infographic, which states that women tend to bulk-buy cosmetics, whilst men are spending remarkably large amounts on grooming products . When it comes to celebrity pulling power, the research states that whilst A-list endorsements can undoubtedly increases sales, it's not the only factor. Kim Kardashian has been reportedly paid $250,000 (£120,000) to tweet about a product to her nearly 22 million Twitter followers, and Cheryl Cole is one of the many celebrity ambassadors for L'Oreal, and has starred in campaigns for its foundation as well as Elnett hairspray. But the research states that it is actually the opinion of friends, family and coworkers that matter the most. Some 44 per cent of women said this would influence their decision of what to buy. Star power: Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, . left, and Cheryl Cole, right, who is a face of L'Oreal, have the . influence to sell millions of beauty products, though aren't the most important factor for buyers . Influence: Celebrities may boost product sales, but we trust friends, family and co-workers the most . Research: When it comes to selling power, celebrity endorsements give brands a massive boost, however, the infographic collated by Feel Unique also shows that brand loyalty is crucial . While 20 per cent said they would reply on online reviews, and just five per cent said they would go by purely the celebrity face of the product. Brush of luck: Women spend an avergsr . Not only do women have an average of 54 . items in their make-up bag - from more than 12 countries they have travelled to - . the total cost of her collection is £512. Furthermore, women will spend a whopping £100,000 on cosmetics over her lifetime, which equates to £40 a week and £2,000 a year. Men aren't that far behind: The average 30-year-old male spends £100 a month on grooming products and treatments, according to a survey by Debenhams. The same study found men in their 40s tend to spend £70 a month of grooming. FeelUnique.com, which created the infographic, collated surveys from the likes of OnePoll, Bionsen, the Daily Mail, Cosmopolitan and Vogue. They also found that 57 per cent of women would rather break up with their boyfriend than break away from their make-up bag. Two thirds of women have admitted to bulk-buying cosmetics in a bid to find the best product to suit them - even if they rarely or never actually use the product. Others said they simply enjoyed splurging on beauty buys because it gave them 'great joy'. The illustration looked in particular at what makes a beauty product iconic. The found that in order for a product to reach this status, it must have 'unique appeal' and the consumer must feel an 'emotional bond' toward it. It also needs to have 'credibility for repeat purchase'. Beauty buys: From gathering various British surveys, Feel Unique found the most iconic beauty products to be Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream and L'Oreal Elnett Hairspray, amongst others . Scents galore: Iconic fragrances include Chanel No.5 from the 1920s, Revlon's Charlie Blue in the 1970s and Calvin Klein's ck one in the 1990s . Looking at iconic products of the past century, classic items such as Elizabeth Arden 8 Hour Cream, L'Oreal Elnett Hairspray, Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion, Maybelline Great Lash Mascara and John Frieda Frizz-Ease Serum all made the list. The Serum, which launched in 1990, sells 13 every minute in the UK, whilst Elizabeth Arden's 8 Hour Cream sells two a minute across the world. In terms of fragrance, Chanel No. 5 is considered the most iconic scent from the 1920s. The perfume Marilyn Monroe famously said she wore to bed - with nothing else - was launched in 1921 and is still a best-seller today. Calvin Klein's ck one was one of the top-selling perfumes of the 1990s and Britney Spears' Curious scent was one of the biggest of the early Noughties. Launched in 2001, Curious was one of the most profitable and iconic celebrity perfumes, pulling in $100m (£60m) within its first five weeks.","Infographic by Feel Unique has collated research from beauty surveys .

"England took the seismic decision to sack their best player on Tuesday as the fallout from the worst Ashes tour in their history claimed its most high-profile victim in Kevin Pietersen. Paul Downton, the new managing director of the England team, made the huge call to dismiss Pietersen — the leading runscorer in their history — just three days after overseeing the departure of their most successful coach Andy Flower. Downton on Tuesday met England captain Alastair Cook and one-day coach Ashley Giles in a hotel opposite Lord’s and they reached the ‘unanimous’ conclusion that Pietersen, after almost as many controversies as runs, is more trouble than he is worth. On Thursday the batsman posted this message on Twitter: 'So sad that this will now be the last time I leave a field in an England shirt... Incredibly…' with a link to an Instagram picture of him trudging off the Sydney Cricket Ground. England exit: Kevin Pietersen peers out of his car after discovering his international career is over . Off drive: Pietersen leaves The Kia Oval following a coaching session as his future was being decided . Bittersweet tweet: Pietersen posted this on Twitter with a link to this Instagram picture (below) showing him leaving the Sydney Cricket Ground, but his reaction in the dressing room wasn't taken to kindly . Shane Warne leapt to his friend's defence, calling the decision a disgrace: 'I also just heard the sad news re KP that he has played his last game for England, to me it's a disgrace & a joke ! The ECB is in a shambles'. And his England and Surrey team-mate Chris Tremlett tweeted: 'Sad to see what has happened with @KP24.Been a great player for England and a match winner. I wish him all the best in the future.' The gifted maverick will not be . considered for the one-day tour of West Indies and the World Twenty20 . that follows next month, meaning an England career of 104 Tests, 23 . hundreds and more than 8,000 runs has reached its end. ‘Clearly this has been a tough decision,’ said Downton. ‘Kevin has been an outstanding player for England. ‘However, . there was a need to begin the long-term planning after the Australia . tour. Therefore we have decided that the time is right to look to the . future and start to rebuild not only the team but also the team ethic . and philosophy.’ It was . the only clue in a bland statement as to the real reasons behind . Pietersen’s departure, which Sportsmail understands centres on his . attitude, particularly towards the end of the Ashes, and what is . perceived to be his poor influence on younger members of the team. ‘Playing . cricket for my country has been an honour,’ said the South African-born . Pietersen, who chose his mother’s country in 2004. ‘Every time I pulled . on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and something . that will live with me for ever. Warne-ing shot: The former Australia leg-spinner blasted the ECB's decision . Net gains: Pietersen (second left) takes a practice session at The Kia Oval on Tuesday as his England fate is being decided at Lord's . Over and out: England have decided it is not worth keeping Pietersen in the side . ‘I . believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer. I will . continue to play but deeply regret it won’t be for England.’ Pietersen’s . departure is the biggest example yet of the dismantling of the England . team in the wake of their horror showing in Australia. Jonathan Trott, . Graeme Swann and Steven Finn all left the tour early while Pietersen and . Flower have gone for good, although Flower is expected to remain in a . development role with the ECB. Downton’s . next job is to find a coach across all formats, with Giles the . favourite despite overseeing the 4-1 one-day series defeat in Australia . and the 3-0 Twenty20 whitewash. Pietersen . can now be expected to cash in on the Twenty20 circuit and will make . himself available for the whole six weeks of the Indian Premier League. He will also play in the Australian Big Bash but first links up with his . mentor Graham Ford, the new Surrey coach, for the domestic season. Happier times: Pietersen is presented with a commemorative cap after playing in his 100th Test . Selection headache: England captain Alastair Cook and one-day coach Ashley Giles held crunch talks . Out of place? He was a character, but South African-born Pietersen never belonged . Kevin Pietersen has been informed by the England and Wales Cricket Board that he has not been included in the England squads for the forthcoming tour of the Caribbean later this month nor the ICC World Twenty20 to be held in Bangladesh in March. Kevin Pietersen met with Paul Downton, the Managing Director England Cricket, this week and was told that the unanimous decision of the England management, including the selectors, was that now was the time to start the rebuilding process after England's disappointing winter in Australia. Paul Downton said: 'Clearly this was a tough decision because Kevin has been such an outstanding player for England as the fact that he is the country's leading run scorer in international cricket demonstrates. 'However everyone was aware that there was a need to begin the long term planning after the Australia tour. Therefore we have decided the time is right to look to the future and start to rebuild not only the team but also team ethic and philosophy. 'England cricket owes a debt of gratitude to Kevin who has proved to be one of the most talented and exciting players to ever represent the country and his 13,797 runs are a testimony to his immense skill. 'This decision brings some clarity now for the future of the England teams and we all wish Kevin the very best in the rest of his career.' Kevin Pietersen played 104 Test Matches, 136 One Day internationals and 37 Twenty20 Internationals for England in a career which has spanned from November 2004 to the final Ashes Test match in Sydney in early January. Kevin Pietersen said: 'Playing cricket for my country has been an honour. Every time I pulled on the England shirt was a moment of huge pride for me and that is something that will live with me forever. 'Although I am obviously very sad the incredible journey has come to an end, I'm also hugely proud of what we, as a team, have achieved over the past nine years. 'I feel extremely fortunate to have played at a time of great success for England cricket alongside some of the best cricketers the country has ever produced. 'I want to thank everyone for their fantastic support and I wish the team the very best of success going forward. 'I believe I have a great deal still to give as a cricketer.

"Tattoos might be skin deep, but you’ll need pretty deep pockets if you decide to have them removed later on, according to new research. Luckily for One Direction, who have covered their bodies in ink, they've earned $75m (£47m) this year alone. A clinic has analysed the body art of the four tattooed members of world-famous boy band One Direction and found that - should the boys ever regret going under the needle - it would cost them almost £68,000 collectively to make their tattoos just a ‘Midnight Memory’. Scroll down for video . Inked: A new piece of research has revealed that it would cost One Direction (excluding Niall, who is ink-free) £68,000 to remove their tattoos . Zayn Malik’s body art has become a hot topic amongst his fans, but removing his famous tattoos - including a cartoon design of fiancée Perrie Edwards - would set him back over £31,000, the most of all the bandmates. Because it’s necessary to wait at least six weeks between removal sessions, which normally last around 40 minutes, Zayn wouldn’t be tattoo-free for 38 years. Harry Styles has undergone quite the transformation in the last four years, abandoning his squeaky-clean image. But should Styles regret the rock-and-roll look, he will have to fork out £19,250 and spend more than 100 hours under the laser. And it would take him a total of 17 years to achieve a blank canvas. That's a LONG time! Harry Styles would have to fork out £19,250 and spend more than 100 hours under the laser if he decided to get rid of his ink . World famous: Zayn Malik has the most body art, but removing his famous tattoos would set him back over £31,000, the most of all the bandmate . If Louis Tomlinson decides he’s over his tattoos, he will need to find time in his hectic tour schedule for more than 100 removal sessions, over a 12-year period, at a cost of £11,894. Liam Payne, who has the least ink of all the boys, would still need to spend almost two full days (44 hours) in the chair for 66 individual sessions over eight years. Perhaps this news will put Niall Horan - the only tattoo-free member of the band - off having any body ink. Although the 1D boys might still love their tats, clinics are witnessing a 52 per cent increase in the number of tattoo removal enquiries in the past six months across the UK, with the cost of removing a small, black and white tattoo starting at around £400. A spokesperson for WhatClinic.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'Body art is a lifetime commitment but people change and, sometimes, the symbols we once wore proudly become something of an embarrassment. Ink also ages and degrades along with our skin, so it may not look as good decades later. Ink-free: The One Direction boys have dramatically changed their image since finding fame with the boyband in 2011 . 'While the technology to remove ink is improving, this is not a great reason to rush any tattoo decision or to take risks with the artist. Always look at the previous work of the actual artist, not just the shop, and be sure to check the standards of equipment and hygiene. 'It's also worth knowing that factors like colour, position and size make a significant impact on the cost and ease of removal - just in case you end up regretting your decision.' Wayne Tatzapa, founder of London-based tattoo removal specialist, Discardead Soho, added: 'The time needed to remove a tattoo varies according to the individual, as do the chances of wiping out all trace of the design. Skin type, the colour and location of the tattoo, scarring and the degree of density will all make a big difference. 'The laser technology used to remove tattoos has come on leaps and bounds in the past few years and the introduction of a state-of-the-art laser called PicoSure means tattoos can now be removed in a third of the time of a normal machine. 'Most people don’t realise that removing tattoos can take months or even years, because laser sessions should be at least six weeks to three months apart to get the best results and minimise the risk of scarring and other side effects.'","Zayn would have to spend more than £31,000 .

"A San Francisco 49ers player who was blasted by fans and his own team after a homophobic tirade on radio has issued a bizarre apology, claiming the comments were a 'reflection of thoughts in my head' but not representative of how he feels. Chris Culliver, a cornerback with the 49ers, made the startling remarks during a radio interview this week with comedian and radio host Artie Lange - days before Sunday's Super Bowl. During a strange line of questioning, Lange asked the 24-year-old: 'Do any gay guys approach you?' Unwelcoming: San Francisco 49ers' Chris Culliver went on a anti-gay rant during a radio interview this week . On the radio: Culliver made the comments in an interview with radio host and comedian Artie Lange this week . Without so much as a pause to even think about the question, Culliver shoots back: 'I don't do the gay guys man. I don't do that.' When asked if he believed there were any gay players on the 49ers roster, Culliver responded: 'No, we don't got no gay people on the team, they gotta get up out of here if they do. He added: 'Can't be with that sweet stuff... Can't be... in the locker room man. Nah.' 'OK, so they'd have to keep it a secret?' Lange asks. Player: Culliver is in his second season with the 49ers, who face off against the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl on Sunday . Culliver responds: 'Yeah, you gotta come out 10 years later after [retirement].' A clip of the interview appeared on Yahoo! Sports. The comments were immediately met with outrage from gay rights groups, 49ers fans and Culliver's bosses and teammates. Later on Wednesday, the player backtracked, issuing a nonsensical statement of apology, blaming his behavior on the thoughts in his head. 'The derogatory comments I made yesterday were a reflection of thoughts in my head, but they are not how I feel,' he said. 'It has taken me seeing them in print to realize that they are hurtful and ugly. Those discriminating feelings are truly not in my heart. Further, I apologize to those who I have hurt and offended, and I pledge to learn and grow from this experience.' Lange admitted that he asked about gay players in a 'goofy' barrage 'where I'm asking all sorts of stupid questions.' Just days before the 49ers take on the Baltimore Ravens in the Super Bowl, Culliver's comments outraged the team's fans. The team’s Facebook page was flooded with comments, telling the team to 'dump Chris Culliver' and  'hope Chris Culiver (sic) gets hurt and cannot ever play again.' Facebook user Janice Weir wrote: 'Chris Culliver not only needs to be recognized as an ignorant homophobe, but also as completely inarticulate and an embarrassment for both San Francisco and for the University of South Carolina.' While another, Brandon Hall, simply said in a comment: 'What Chris Culliver said disgusts me.' In a statement on Wednesday, the team said: 'The San Francisco 49ers reject the comments that were made yesterday, and have addressed the matter with Chris.' 'There is no place for discrimination within our organization at any level. We have and always will proudly support the LGBT community.' Outcry: Fans flooded the 49ers Facebook page to air their opinions and tell the team what they should do about Culliver . An advocacy group for gay athletes . called the Last Closet said in a statement to sfgate.com that homophobia . was still rife in professional sports. 'Culliver's comments are a perfect . example of why there needs to be more discussion amongst the sports . hierarchy about how to combat homophobia,' the statement read. While the gay community may be up in arms over Culliver’s comments, they have a friend on the opposing team. Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo has long been a supporter of gay rights and same-sex marriage, and said that he would use the Super Bowl spotlight to promote bullying awareness. The progressive player told Yahoo! Sports on Wednesday that the issue of gay marriage is 'a little off the beaten path, but it's an issue that affects everybody.' He said he has battled with acceptance coming from a biracial family and that gay people battling for equal rights is similar. 'It's all the same to me,' he said. 'It's the evolution in our society about acceptance. We don't want kids to be deterred from sports. I believe you're born the way you're born.' In the history of the NFL, there has never been a player who has come out as gay during his career, though several have after their retirement. Last year, former 49er Kwame Harris was arrested for allegedly assaulting a former boyfriend in Menlo Park, California. Until then, Harris was extremely private about his sexual orientation.

"The US booty business is booming thanks to an increasing number of women who are eagerly attempting to accentuate their rear ends and replicate the impressively big butts made famous by their favorite stars. According to new figures, companies are cashing in on the growing trend for bigger behinds, offering women everything from special posterior-plumping gym classes to padded panties in order help them enlarge their behinds. Some women have even been encouraged to undergo surgery in order to gain their ideal butt size. While Nicki Minaj boasts about her 'big fat' butt in rap single Anaconda, reality star Kim Kardashian continues to post a seemingly endless stream of ‘belfies’ – otherwise known as ‘butt selfies’ – on her Instagram, and women are, statistics say, starting to take notice. Scroll down for video . Bootylicious: Stars like hip-hop artist Nicki Minaj  who regularly flaunt their fuller rear ends, have prompted a demand for fuller backsides among American women . So much so that some businesses specializing in butts say pop culture has had a direct impact on their bottom line. A Brazilian butt lift, in which fat is sucked from a patient's stomach, love handles or back and put into their buttocks and hips, is increasingly popular in the U.S. This type of surgery, along with buttock implants, was the fastest-growing plastic surgery last year, with more than 11,000 procedures, up 58 per cent from 2012, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Dr Matthew Schulman, who performs the procedure in New York, says this year has been busier than last. Schulman, who charges $10,000 to $13,000 for the three-hour surgery, does six to eight Brazilian butt lifts weekly, up about 25 per cent from a year ago. He says when he asks patients which celebrity butt they want, the top names are Ms Kardashian, Ms Minaj and Ms Lopez. Recently, more women have asked for a butt like Kardashian's sister, Khloe, who also stars in the reality show. Fitness craze: Kelly Brabants (front) leads her Booty by Brabants class at The Club by George Foreman III gym in Boston . The downside of the new interest is that women desperate for cheap options have risked their lives, going to phony doctors that inject silicone, and even bathroom caulk, into their buttocks. Deaths have been reported in Miami, New York, Las Vegas and Jackson, Mississippi. Another problem is doctors performing butt-enhancement surgeries that don't have experience. Dr Schulman says about 20 per cent of his patients come to him so he can fix lumps, bumps and uneven butt cheeks done by unskilled doctors. Not everyone is trying surgery, though. Those looking for more natural ways to enhance their derriere are attending workout classes and watching workout videos that target the butt. DailyBurn, which streams workout videos, says views for its Butt, Hips and Thighs video doubled in January and have remained popular. The video is so popular that DailyBurn is adding another butt workout clip in December. At a gym in Boston, there's a waitlist for a $30 class that fits in 120 squats in 45 minutes. The class, Booty by Brabants, was started by Kelly Brabants a year ago. Ms Brabants starts most classes, held at The Club by George Foreman III gym, with Ms Lopez's Booty song.  By the end of the year, she plans to expand her brand by selling $65 workout leggings that help perk up the butt. A little lift: Jessica Asmar, owner of Feel Foxy, adjusts padded panties on a mannequin in the studio at her Katy, Texas, warehouse. She says sales are up 40 per cent from a year ago . 'It's not about being stick-thin anymore,' says Ms Brabants. 'Every girl now wants a booty.' As a result of the pop culture moment the butt is having, sales for Booty Pop, which hawks $22 foam padded panties on its website, are up 47 per cent in the last six months from the same period a year earlier. The company, which declined to give sales figures, has sold out of certain styles and colors this year, including its Pink Cotton Candy Boy Shorts. Susan Bloomstone, Booty Pop's co-founder, says customers have asked for larger sizes. So, the Boston-based company plans to begin selling pads that are 25 per cent larger this month. 'People just want more booty,' she says. Feel Foxy, another maker of padded panties, says 2014 has been its best year since launching nearly a decade ago. Sales are up 40 per cent from a year ago, but the company declined to give sales figures. 'The Nicki Minaj song gave women the idea to pay attention to their rear end,' says Jessica Asmar, co-owner of the Houston company. Deborah Santiago squeezed into a $40 Feel Foxy one-piece for her 30th birthday. The shapewear flattened Ms Santiago's waist and boosted her back side. A flat butt can ruin an outfit, says the New York stay-at-home mother of two. Ms Lopez is her butt idol, but she also covets the bottoms of reality TV stars on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and Love & Hip Hop. Inspiration: Jennifer Lopez (left), seen performing with Iggy Azalea (right) has one of the derrieres most requested by plastic surgeons . 'I always wanted a big butt,' Ms Santiago says. 'Something you could look twice at.' To be sure, the desire for big butts isn't new. Large booties long have been preferable in Latino and black communities, says Dr Dionne Stephens, an associate psychology professor at Florida International University who has researched sexuality in popular culture. And this is not the first time big butts have been in songs. (Think: Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-A-Lot in the 1990s.) But recently, the desire for a bigger bottom became more mainstream, in large part due to pop culture influences. Mainstream celebrities like Ms Lopez and Ms Minaj accepting their ample assets on camera have given the butt cachet. 'When people see things repeated on TV more and more, it becomes normalized,' Stephens says. French sociologist Jean-Claude Kaufmann says this is true overseas, too: 'In Europe, and in France especially, there's a trend to show off the buttocks in place of breasts. This has to do with Latin American influences, but also the rise of Beyonce and stars like Rihanna,' says Mr Kaufmann, author of Women's Bodies, Men's Gaze. Sociology of Naked Breasts. Real and spectacular: Kim Kardashian, pictured in 2012, had an X-ray to prove she didn't have butt implants on an episode of her reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians . Mr Kaufmann also suggests economic reasons are at play: 'In uncertain times, people look for security,' he says. 'Men are attracted to women's hips and the buttocks for security and reassurance. Women respond to this. It's deeply psychological.' Whatever the reason, the widespread interest in larger hind parts seems to have started when Ms Kardashian's reality TV show, Keeping up with the Kardashians, began airing seven years ago. In a 2011 episode, she had an X-ray to prove she didn't have butt implants. Ms Kardashian still frequently posts shots of her backside to her 21 million Instagram followers. But the desire for big buns has intensified. This summer, the music video for Anaconda that showed Ms Minaj in a pink thong was viewed 19.6 million times within 24 hours of its release — a record for music video site Vevo. It has racked up nearly 300 million views. The song has been on the top of the Billboard charts, too, right behind another anthem for curvy women, Meghan Trainor's All About That Bass. 'I'm bringing booty back,' Miss Trainor sings.","The Brazilian butt lift, along with buttock implants, was the fastest-growing plastic surgery in the U.S. last year .

"A Texas teenager who was battling cancer was shot dead outside his home over the weekend. Witnesses said that Duncanville middle school student Ryan Lara was moving his parents' car from the street to their driveway on Saturday when someone tried to rob him, then opened fire. It has been reported that three shots were fired, with one hitting Lara in the back. Family members rushed from the house after hearing the shooting and saw a gray or silver four door sedan speed away. Ryan Lara, 15, was shot dead outside his family's Texas home while moving his parents car into the driveway . MyFoxdfw.com reports that Lara's brother, Brandon, shot at the car with his own gun, but it is not known if any bullets struck the vehicle. He said: 'I ran out, stepped over him and proceeded to pull out my pistol with my left hand and started firing at the vehicle with no headlights or no lights on. Police aren't sure if more than one person is responsible for Lara's death but have offered up to $5,000 for the indictment of those involved. Lara, who was a seventh grade student at Byrd Middle School, noticed a lump in his chest two months ago that was later diagnosed as lymphoma. He had surgery to remove it and had just started chemotherapy. Lara, was shot in Duncanville, outside his family home in the 700 block of Wren Avenue . Seven years earlier Lara was struck an emotional blow when his mother died, something that caused him to be held back at school. Brandon said his brother, who was a wide receiver for his school's football team, was 'very loveable'. Lara's family wants the person or people in that sedan to come forward. Brandon said: 'He didn't deserve this and I just hope whoever killed him...what's done in the dark is soon going to come to the light.' Duncanville ISD informed their students of Lara's death by letter and grief counselors were at the school on Monday.","Ryan Lara had recently started chemotherapy after undergoing surgery .

"This amazing picture shows winter sweeping south in dramatic style as a huge dust cloud is blasted over Colorado. The storm is part of a frigid wave of arctic air pushing south into the United States, coating parts of the Midwest with more than a foot of snow. And along with dumps of snow - which will spread across the country later in the week - the influx of cold air sent temperatures tumbling as much as 50 degrees in hours. Dust storm: This image, taken from the window of a passenger plane over Colorado, was caused by cold air pushing south thanks to an unusual weather system that sent temperatures plummeting . The dust storm, seen from the window of a passenger plane headed to Chicago from Los Angeles, was created when winds plunging south kicked up loose dirt particles and carried them along in their wake. Passenger Amanda Wicks managed to get the aerial shot from the plane window, which shows the boundary between the new, cold front and the warmer air it is pushing out of the way. The phenomenon, known as a haboob, was also caught in satellite images by the National Weather Service. It is part of the 'Omega Block' weather system being caused by the remnants of a Typhoon sat in the Bering Sea. From space: This weather satellite image, uploaded and annotated by the National Weather Service, shows the 'haboob' front (circled) sweeping south from Colorado from above . Pushing south: The unseasonably cold air (blue and purple above) has been spreading south over the weekend, reaching as far as Texas, where temperatures tumbled some 50 degrees in a matter of hours . The system alters the path of the jet stream - fast-flowing winds which separate warm and cold air - bringing unusual temperatures across North America. Cold air which usually sits around Canada and the north of the U.S. has been dragged as far south as Texas, while the warm air which usually sits around the middle of the United States has been sucked up towards Alaska, and is set to make the region unusually warm. The boundaries of these temperature changes are accompanied by dramatic changes in climate, and spectacular weather formations such as the pictured dust storm. Snowstorms: Midwestern states have been hit by intense snowstorms as part of the weather formation. Pictured is the scene in Bismarck, North Dakota . Road chaos: Pictured is a pick-up truck that overturned near Alexandria, Minnesota, yesterday . Parts of Texas which were enjoying temperatures in the mid to high 70s over the weekend found themselves plunged into the teens in a matter of hours when the cold air rolled in. By Thursday full effects of the displacement will have set in, meaning areas like Barrow, the northernmost point of Alaska, could have temperatures in the 50s. This outstrips estimates for Dallas, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. For now, the most visible effect of the weather system has been huge snowstorms pummeling the Midwest, where schools have closed and hundreds of accidents have been reported on roads around Wisconsin and Minnesota, where as much as 16.5 inches of snow have fallen.","Plane passenger captured 'haboob' dust storm sweeping south .

"A 23-year-old mother of two from New Mexico was found slain in a local park Sunday as her young son was wandering nearby. Investigators are looking at surveillance video and conducting interviews, but they have yet to identify any suspects in the killing of Ariel Ulibarri, of Clovis. The woman's 6-year-old son was found unharmed in the parking lot, and what he told investigators has them considering the case as a homicide. Police found the woman's body at around 7.30am Sunday after people heard screams at the Goodwin Lake Trails Walking Park. Mother slain: Ariel Ulibarri (left and right), 23, was found murdered in a New Mexico park where she went with her son Sunday . The mother's body was found after people heard screams at the Goodwin Lake Trails Walking Park . Police Capt. Patrick Whitney said investigators do not know at this time whether Miss Ulibarri was targeted by somebody she knew, or whether she was a victim of a random attack. Police withheld specifics on how she was killed, but according to a press release posted online, what the responding officers came upon was a grisly crime scene. 'The death of the woman is considered a homicide at this time due to the amount of blood,' police stated. The attack on the young mother is believed to have taken place six minutes before police received the first 911 call about a possible homicide in the park. Young witness: Ulibarri's 6-year-old son (seen here with his face obscured) was found unharmed wandering in the parking lot of the park . The little boy ran into a passerby and led him to the site of his mother's slaying . Sgt. Daron Roach said that one of the callers was an elderly man who told the emergency dispatcher that he had run into the victim's son in the parking lot. 'Then the boy led him to where his mother had been brutally murdered,' Roach told the station Connect Amarillo. Police are now waiting for the results of an autopsy on Miss Ulibarri's body by the state Office of the Medical Investigator, which said Tuesday that the final report likely won't be available for several weeks. Gruesome: According to police, they concluded that Miss Ulibarri had been murdered based on the amount of blood found at the scene . Mystery: Police are looking at social media sites and Ulibarri's text messages, but for now they have no suspects . Investigators are in the process of checking social media sites, cell phone records and text messages related to Ariel Ulibarri. They are also talking to people who had had relationships with the 23-year-old. Meanwhile, Sgt. Roach said police patrol the park but have had few if any calls about trouble in the 40-acre park, which opened in 2011, the Clovis News Journal reported. Parks Director Mark Dayhoff said the area around the trail gets little maintenance because it's intended to be a nature trail.","Ariel Ulibarri, 23, was found murdered at Goodwin Lake Trails Walking Park in New Mexico .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans has moved step a closer to returning to professional football after it was revealed he will start training with former club Sheffield United this week. More than 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the club not to let him return after he was jailed for five years for raping a 19-year-old in hotel room in front of friends. He was released last month and continues to deny he raped the girl in a Premier Inn in his hometown of Rhyl, north Wales. Evans will not be paid for his time back with the club on a PFA-style trial with the Blades, who plan to release a statement later this week. Controversial: Rapist Ched Evans will start training with his former club Sheffield United this week despite 150,000 people demanding the club turn him away . New start: Ched Evans is to marry his fiancée Natasha Massey after proposing shortly after he was released from prison, where he served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl . Man City (2007-09): 16 games, 1 goal . Norwich (loan, 2007-08): 28 games, 10 goals . Sheff Utd (2009-12): 103 games, 42 goals . Wales (2008-11): 13 games, 1 goal . But by the end of the week Evans will be training with United, where he earned £20,000 before he was jailed, and is likely to be the final step before he signs for them permanently. The club has repeatedly refused to rule out signing the player and some of its fans have been chanting his name at games since his release. Sheffield United have already contacted the Football Association to inform them of the news, according to the BBC. The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire in October. He then proposed to fiancée Natasha Massey, who has led the campaign against his conviction. Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for. In the video, Evans apologised to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'. He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. Evans warms up at the Millennium Stadium ahead of Wales' Euro 2012 qualifier against England in March 2011 . 'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. 'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful. 'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name.' Ms Massey appeared to be wearing an 'engagement' ring in the video, but it is now believed to have been a 'commitment ring' Evans gave her while he was in prison. It is understood that Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed. It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail . Ms Massey, pictured with Evans last week, is said to be 'over the moon' after he proposed to her . Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. Shortly before his release earlier this month, she wrote on the ChedEvans.com website: 'Not a minute passes when I don't think about Ched, his mental and physical strength is admirable and keeps us all positive. 'When Ched is released the fight to clear his name will continue, however long it takes this is one fight we will not lose. 'My boyfriend was wrongly convicted and we are doing everything in our power to clear his name.' She later told ITV's This Morning: ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him. ‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time. ‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’ Ms Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' Evans had been serving at HMP Wymott prison in Lancashire but was released earlier this month . Evans's own family have criticised his lack of remorse, with his aunt Nina Evans, 56, urging him to apologise to his victim. She said: ‘He deserved to go down as he was found guilty - he did rape her.’ His victim's father has also spoken out, demanding an apology from the footballer. He said: ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found. ‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her.' The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case  as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release.","Welsh footballer jailed for five years in 2012 for raping 19-year-old woman .

"Scotland and Northern Ireland have been shielded from spending cuts of around £800million because of ‘flaws’ in the formula used to calculate how much public money they should receive. A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies revealed the unfairness of the so-called Barnett Formula – which decides how funds are distributed between nations of the UK – is getting worse, with every person in Scotland an extra £113 better off than people in England and Wales, and £110 per person in Northern Ireland. As a result of spending reviews in 2010 and 2013, devolved administrations were spared cuts totalling around £600million in Scotland and £200million in Northern Ireland. The Barnett Formula creator, Lord Barnett, who died earlier this month. A new report has revealed the growing unfairness of the system . The formula’s creator, Lord Barnett, who died earlier this month, had called for reform of the 35-year-old system, which he said was unfair and out of date. But the Treasury insisted it ‘will continue’. The report’s author, David Phillips, said: ‘Scotland and Northern Ireland avoided cuts that England and Wales have faced.’ Tory MPs said the report will fuel new pressure on ministers to reform the spending formula which dates from the 1970s. But the Treasury insisted the Barnett formula ‘will continue’. Former minister Christopher Chope said the report would fuel public anger about the injustice of the formula – and insisted it could not remain in place. ‘What this shows is that the formula is flawed and is not fit for purpose. Any suggestion that it can be left in place unchanged is not going to be acceptable to people in other parts of the UK.’ ‘This is one further example of the injustice of it and the lack of transparency.’ ‘My constituents are concerned that they cannot get free prescriptions and help with long term care for the elderly and free tuition fees, when these are things that are freely available in Scotland.’ The existing formula, which has been the source of resentment in England for many years, means that public spending per head is £1,623 a year higher in Scotland than in England. Around two thirds of English MPs want to axe Barnett, including 83 per cent of Conservatives. But during the Scottish referendum campaign, amid panic about the prospect of a yes vote for independence, all three party leaders pledged to continue using the formula. Today’s report reveals that technical details in the way business rates are allocated across different parts of the country is making the discrepancy worse. As a result of the spending reviews in 2010 and 2013, devolved administrations were spared cuts totalling around £600 million in Scotland and £200 million in Northern Ireland, compared to England and Wales, . The Scottish Parliament, pictured, were spared spending cuts worth £600million in 2010 and 2013, according to the research . In the decade from 2000, the flaw was worth some £400million to Scotland – meaning it is now some £1billion higher than it otherwise would be. That amounts to three per cent of the Scottish Government’s budget. The problem could get even worse, as further taxes when further taxes - stamp duty, land and landfill taxes - are to be devolved early next year. Ministers are yet to decide how the grants will be adjusted as a result – raising fears it could mean England and Wales are even more worse off. The report’s author David Phillips, a senior research economist at the IFS, called for the issue to be corrected . ‘The Barnett formula looks set to remain in place for some years to come. This appears to rule out a move to a needs-based formula,’ said Mr Phillips. ‘But it makes it more important than ever to examine the Barnett formula to see if it is working in the way intended, and if flaws are found, to fix them. ‘Problems with the way the Barnett formula treats business rates mean that Scotland and Northern Ireland have avoided hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts that they would have faced under a corrected formula - cuts that England and Wales have faced. ‘It is important to get the interaction between devolved taxes and the Barnett formula right. Whatever is decided about which taxes should be devolved, it is crucial to get right the seemingly technical issue of exactly how changes in revenues from those taxes translate into changes in funding.’ In Scotland and Northern Ireland, business rates are fully devolved to the administrations in Holyrood and Stormont, pictured . The Barnett formula decides how central funds are distributed between the nations of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, business rates are fully devolved to the administrations in Holyrood and Stormont, while in England the formula treats them as a contribution towards the Department for Communities and Local Government’s budget for local authorities. The anomaly means block grants to Scotland and Northern Ireland being cut by much less than the average reduction faced by departments serving England, the IFS said. Business rates are only partially devolved to Wales at present, with full devolution set to occur in April 2015. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The arrangements for business rates in Scotland and Northern Ireland have been in place since devolution in the late 1990s. ‘Like all other areas of spending, the treatment of local government spending in the Barnett Formula is based on the level of devolution of services, not on individual revenue streams like business rates. ‘The leaders of all three main UK parties have been clear that the Barnett formula will continue. As the report suggests, we will therefore need to put in place arrangements to ensure that neither the UK Government or Devolved Administrations gain or lose from further devolution. Ensuring that the risks and rewards associated with decisions taken by the devolved administrations are borne by them, and that mechanisms exist to adjust the block grant accordingly, will be a key consideration.’","A new report has revealed the growing unfairness of the Barnett Formula .

"A billboard advertising a heavily trafficked pornography site caused controversy in Los Angeles after it was put up above a popular family hot dog and hamburger restaurant. The sign was painted over last Monday after hanging above  Carney's restaurant for two weeks on the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. 'You walk up my ramp, and the billboard stares straight at you,' said the restaurant's owner John Wolfe told the LA Times. Need a hand?: Pornhub hung this billboard above Carney's hot dog and hamburger restaurant in West Hollywood which sparked some controversy . Family restaurant: Carmey's is a hot dog and hamburger destination in West Hollywood that is frequented by both adults and their children, some of whom were curious about the racy billboard . 'If you're going to do something like that, put it in a strip club.... Kids were asking their parents about it,' he added. The Billboard popped up a day last month in West Hollywood just days after being taken down in Times Square. Pornhub's vice president Corey Price told the LA Times that he decided to post the billboard in order to push pornography, ‘into the mainstream consciousness and away from what most people conceive as being a taboo subject.' The advertisement which hung in Times Square was taken down after two days when the Hilton Doubletree's general manager complained. 'All you need is hand,' read the racy billboard insinuating that watching pornography can be a solo activity. The LA Times reports that after the billboard went up, people stopped in the Carney's parking lot to take selfies with it. One man tweeted, 'the world is officially coming to an end.' 'Had I not been in a hurry, I would have totally stopped for a photo,' said Filmmaker Joshua Caldwell who spotted the sign while stuck in traffic. Porn 'used to be this hidden thing no one really talked about.... It certainly made me do a double take.' City spokeswoman Lisa Bedlanti said that no formal complaints were made about the billboard but even if they were the city has no control over privately owned billboards.

Dominant: Novak Djokovic beat Jeremy Chardy in straight sets to progress in the French Open . No contest: Djokovic won 6-1 6-4 6-2 to reach the third round of the French Open . More to come: However, it is the one Grand Slam to elude the Serb and he will have his work cut out to win it . Djokovic was demonstrating all of his trademark athleticism to make it hard for his opponent but Chardy was not helping himself with unforced errors and the Serbian closed out the set in just 25 minutes. Djokovic broke Chardy in the first game of the second but the Frenchman broke right back before dropping his serve again with a double fault to hand the initiative back to his opponent. The rest of the set went with serve and Djokovic never looked overly troubled as he appeared to be going through the motions. Djokovic made it five from five on break point in the opening game of the third and looked set to steamroller his way to victory but he handed Chardy a second serve as he attempted to break back and the world number 42 took advantage with a crushing forehand. The run of breaks continued as Djokovic took the next and he was well in control despite letting out an almighty cry of frustration when sending a backhand into the net. Djokovic dropped his first two break points of the match in the next but made no mistake with the third, a backhand pass securing a 4-1 lead and ending Chardy's resistance. The remaining games went with serve as the rain began to fall on Court Philippe Chatrier and Djokovic eased into the next round. Photographic memory: Djokovic's coach Boris Becker was paying close attention to the match . Team: Becker later celebrated with Marian Vajda (2nd L), physical trainer Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (2nd R) and physiotherapist Milan Amanovic . Aerial view: Djokovic has so far won six Grand Slam titles, including four triumphs in Australia .

"Tony Pulis says West Bromwich Albion are being made to wait on their pursuit of Callum McManaman – but says he has ‘lots of irons in the fire’. Wigan have so far held firm in the face of two bids from West Brom, the latest on the table amounting to around £4million for the 23-year-old winger. Pulis is keen to make McManaman his first signing since taking over, and is also in the hunt for Darren Fletcher – although he is aware the Manchester United midfielder has a number of options with West Ham appearing to lead the chase. Tony Pulis wants to make Callum McManaman (above) his first signing at West Brom . The Baggies boss insists he has other 'irons in the fire' if they fail to land the Wigan forward . Pulis said: 'We’ve an interest in McManaman along with one or two others. It’s got to be right for everybody. Both clubs have go to agree. It’s got to be right for the player as well. 'If it’s not McManaman we’ve got other irons in the fire. Like a lot of things, you’d love things to drop into place straight away, but it’s often not that way.' Pulis added: 'I think Darren is talking to three or four other clubs as well. We have shown an interest. The lad has got to sit down and make a decision.’ Darren Fletcher (left) and McManaman are the Baggies primary transfer targets in Janaury . Meanwhile, Georgios Samaras is set to leave West Brom on loan as Tony Pulis' clearout continues. The Greece international is expected to join Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal on a six-month deal with a view to a permanent move, Sportsmail understands. He signed a two-year deal in the summer after joining on a free from Celtic but has made just eight substitute appearances, all without scoring.","Tony Pulis wants to make Wigan's Callum McManaman his first signing .

"Pregnant: Equalities minister Jo Swinson is due to give birth on Christmas Day . The heavily pregnant minister who stood throughout Prime Minister's Questions has insisted she does not think it would have been 'sexist' if an MP had offered her a seat. A major row erupted in Westminster after aides to Lib Dem equalities minister Jo Swinson suggested she thought it was ‘quite sexist’ to claim she was not capable of standing. But in an attempt to diffuse the row, which saw David Cameron insist offering a seat was the 'decent thing to do, Miss Swinson has insisted that all seat offers are 'welcome' and 'definitely not sexist'. The incident reignited the debate . about whether people should offer their seat to pregnant women, and . whether expectant mothers should assume they would. Mr Cameron made clear that giving up a seat for a pregnant woman was the 'decent thing' to do. Miss Swinson champions women’s rights in government and has called for a change in attitudes to new parents. But . onlookers were alarmed to see the 33-year-old standing during . throughout PMQs yesterday, while Labour, Tory and Lib Dem  backbenchers . sat nearby. As David Cameron . took questions in the Commons at midday every seat was taken, leaving a . large group of MPs standing by the main doors. Miss Swinson, who is due to give birth on Christmas Day, was among them. But none of the MPs sitting just feet away offered her a seat – to the surprise of Westminster observers. James . Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator, wrote on Twitter: ‘Quite . remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months . pregnant, a seat. 'Really shocking lack of manners and decency.’ Conservative MP Priti Patel, who was . in another part of the chamber, said: ‘I saw her standing and I thought . someone should have made the gesture of offering her a seat. She is very . heavily pregnant and it’s just the decent thing to do. ‘If I see someone on the Tube or the bus who’s pregnant, I will absolutely always get up for them.’ Yesterday aides to Miss Swinson claimed the idea that she was not capable of standing was 'sexist'. A . source close to the minister said: ‘The suggestion somehow that people . should be outraged on her behalf is ridiculous. The idea that just . because she is seven months pregnant she has lost all ability to stand . on her two feet or fend for herself is quite sexist. 'She . did not think it was an issue. If she had wanted to sit down she would . have asked to sit. She is quite capable of fulfilling her functions as a . minister – including standing and walking – while she is pregnant. She . is not somehow severely incapacitated.’ But Miss Swinson last night tried to . play down the claims. She wrote on Twitter: 'About to get on the tube - . seat offers welcome & definitely not sexist :o) But I was happier standing at pmqs yesterday.' And today she praised a  'lovely man who put my case in the overhead locker on last night's flight home'. Standing room only: None of the MPs who had secured a seat for Prime Minister's Questions gave up their place for Miss Swinson (circled) The issue of whether to offer up a seat to a pregnant woman has become increasingly vexed. In . one camp are those that argue expectant mothers are more likely to be . tired - they are carrying around another person after all - and will . appreciate the option of sitting down. But critics say the idea that a pregnant woman cannot stand up on a train or a bus is sexist and patronising. Last . year mother-to-be Meenakshi Minnis hit out at 'barbaric' passengers on a . packed Manchester tram who refused to give up their tram seat - even . though she is eight months' pregnant and needs crutches to walk. When . Kate Middleton, five months pregnant, was presented with a 'Baby On . Board' in March last year she joked she would 'wear it at home'. Yesterday the source close to Miss Swinson said the minister did not . want to ‘give a running commentary’ on whether she had been offered or . accepted seats in other circumstances, such as on public transport. ‘Sometimes . she’s in the middle of a carriage surrounded by people who are also . standing so other passengers may not see her,’ the source added. ‘She . does not necessarily feel aggrieved about that.’ Miss Swinson is a junior business minister working with Vince Cable, and has pushed for greater equality for women at work. She . has admitted the pressure of carrying a baby was taking its toll on . being a minister in the government and Lib Dem MP for East . Dunbartonshire. However Mr Cameron's official . spokesman insisted the Prime Minister thought anyone should give up . their seat for a pregnant woman. 'Take the example of public transport . - I think if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than . yourself I think offering that seat is a good thing to do... a decent thing to do,' the . spokesman said. Asked if Mr Cameron would offer his seat to a pregnant woman if he was on a bus, the spokesman said: 'I'm sure he would.' Pressed on whether that would be a . sexist thing to do, the spokesman said: 'Offering one's seat to someone . who is in greater need than oneself on public transport? I think that's a . very understandable thing to do.' Once tipped as a future Scottish . Secretary, she admitted she will not be able to lead the charge in next . year’s independent referendum. ‘Clearly, . there will be a period when I won’t be able to be quite as active on . the doorsteps,’ she told the Independent on Sunday last month. ‘But, . yes, I want to be strongly involved in that campaign because I believe . it’s so important for the future of Scotland and, indeed, for the future . of the UK.’ She is also adamant that she will not take ministerial red boxes while on maternity leave. ‘I . am still very committed and enjoy my job and want to come back to . continue doing that, but I think having a bit of time to do that early . bonding is also really important.’","Equalities minister left without a seat during 30-minute Commons session .

"White House Ebola response coordinator Ron Klain will not appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Wednesday when it convenes a hearing on the federal government's response to the deadly viral outbreak. The seldom-seen Klain, known in Washington as President Obama's 'Ebola czar,' has already skipped one Ebola-related hearing in the House of Representatives, held two days after he officially started on the job. The high-profile November 12 Senate hearing would be a typical forum for him to answer questions about how the work of various cabinet-level agencies will be integrated together if Congress approves Obama's latest funding request. But instead of risking tough questions during a public hearing, Klain privately briefed congressional leaders on Friday at the White House and appeared Tuesday on the administration-friendly MSNBC. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . HE'S ALIVE: White House Ebola czar Ron Klain emerged from behind the scenes on Tuesday to talk with the Obama administration-friendly MSNBC . IN THE ROOM BUT NOT IN THE GAME: Klain (top, 2nd left) was flanked by CDC director Thomas Frieden and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell during a Nov. 4 White House Ebola meeting, and seated across from Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson (foreground) -- but he's the only one of the group who won't testify . His TV appearance marked the hospital discharge of New York City doctor Craig Spencer, who has been declared Ebola-free after contracting the illness in western Africa. 'Today is a milestone,' Klain said. 'But let’s be clear ... we’re going to see occasional additional cases of Ebola in our country. This is not the last one.' The White House has asked for $6.18 billion in emergency funding to fight the disease, including $4.64 billion to meet immediate needs and another $1.54 billion 'as a Contingency Fund to ensure that there are resources available to meet the evolving nature of the epidemic.' Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the committee's chairwoman until Republicans take over the Senate in January, emphasized in her hearing announcement the need to attack Ebola on multiple fronts by deploying resources overseas, stopping Ebola at the U.S. border and supporting scientific advances. One Senate aide to a committee Republican told MailOnline on Tuesday that Klain should appear personally to describe how he is coordinating these efforts for the benefit of lawmakers who weren't in Friday's high-level White House briefing. 'The whole idea of having an Ebola czar is turning out to be a big charade if he doesn't suit up to play,' he said. 'It just feeds this idea that the White House isn't willing to be transparent. If Klain is drawing a salary from the administration, he shouldn't be allowed to refuse to answer questions about what he's doing.' The aide spoke on condition of anonymity. A White House official told MailOnline that other witnesses who will show up 'will be senior representatives from the departments and agencies executing our Ebola response both at home and abroad.' 'They are well placed to discuss the emergency funding request,' he said.' The official ignored did not respond to a question about what might be on Klain's calendar during the 2:00 p.m. hearing on Wednesday. The administration is sending HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to Capitol Hill instead, along with CDC director Thomas Frieden, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, a top USAID coordinator and experts from the State and Defense departments. Four of the eight witnesses will offer opening statements, an Appropriations Committee spokesman told MailOnline, but all of them will be available to answer questions. Klain won't be among them. RON KLAIN WHO? Obama's 'Ebola czar' isn't exactly a rousing success, with 40 per cent of Americans saying they've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he's doing a good job . VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE: Just 34 per cent of Americans say they have faith in President Barack Obama to manage the Ebola crisis the right way moving forward . LOTS TO COORDINATE: Klain told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Tuesday that the United States will see more Ebola cases . The longtime Democratic Party operative who served a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, has had a rough start in his role. In a MailOnline/YouGov poll during the last days of October, just 10 per cent of Americans said they approved of his job performance. That's a lower number than the dismal ratings of Congress itself. Fully 40 per cent of adults surveyed said they had never heard of him. Following the October 24 Ebola hearing in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California said it was understandable that Klain didn't appear since he was getting up to speed. But 'we do not expect that that would be repeated if there’s a followup hearing,' he cautioned. Ebola czar Ron Klain won't testify in Wednesday's Ebola hearing, but the White House is sending a cavalcade of other witnesses whose agencies' epidemic responses he is tasted with 'coordinating': . Sylvia Mathews Burwell, HHS Secretary . Accompanied by: . Jeh Johnson, Homeland Security Secretary . Heather Higginbottom, State Department Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources . Accompanied by: . Michael Lumpkin, Defense Department Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict . Accompanied by: . Obama attracted criticism in 2009 for appointing 18 'czars' to advise him on everything from global warming to guns. Because none of them has legal authority –~ their role is limited to advising the White House – they're not subject to the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. That means, unlike cabinet secretaries, they don't have to withstand the scrutiny of a Senate confirmation hearing, and the Executive Office of the President can shield them from congressional hearings. The late West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd complained to the White House a month after Obama took office in 2009, saying that 'the rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and balances.' 'At the worst,' Byrd wrote in February 2009, 'White House staff have taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials. … As presidential assistants, they are not accountable to Congress, to Cabinet officials and to virtually anyone but the president.' On the Republican side, Maine Sen. Susan Collins once threatened to hold up funding if White House czars aren't made available for congressional testimony. She proposed legislation in September 2009 to do just that. It never got off the ground in a Senate controlled by Democrats. 'Many of these new ""czars,"" she said on the Senate floor, 'appear to occupy positions of greater responsibility and authority than officials who already have been confirmed by the Senate.' 'The appointments of so many czars have muddied the waters, causing confusion and risking miscommunication going forward,' Collins added. 'We need to know, with clarity: Who is responsible for what? Who is in charge – the czar or the Cabinet official? Who can Congress and the American people hold accountable for government policies that affect daily life?'","Senators will convene Wednesday to hear cabinet-level agencies' funding requests for their Ebola responses but Klain won't show up .

"Thousands of elderly patients are at risk of going blind because of long NHS waiting times, eye specialists warn. Nearly three-quarters of doctors say patients suffering with the aggressive wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) had to wait more than the recommended two weeks for their first sight-saving injection. Many also wait too long for follow up treatment, according to the survey by the Royal College of Ophthalmologists and the Macular Society charity. Thousands of elderly patients are at risk of going blind due to long NHS waiting times according to eye specialists . Rising demand from an ageing population and financial pressures mean patients suffering from conditions such as AMD – which can cause blindness if left untreated – are not getting the help they need in time, it is claimed. AMD is the biggest cause of sight loss in the UK, with the wet form affecting about 40,000 new patients each year. The dry type of AMD is more common but less severe and slower in affecting vision. If caught in time, the wet form can be treated using a drug injected into the eye every few weeks. But untreated wet AMD can rob a person of their central vision in a few weeks, while delayed treatment is also less effective. People at risk of going blind from glaucoma can be identified by looking at how their eyes move when they are watching TV, claim scientists at City University London. They used a tracking device to map eye movements, which identified lost peripheral vision, says a report in the journal Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience. It is hoped the discovery will lead to quicker treatment. Other similar diseases of the retina caused by diabetes and blocked blood vessels are now treatable in the same way for tens of thousands of new patients every year, and clinics are struggling to cope, say doctors. The survey of 226 consultant ophthalmologists found more than three-quarters blamed medical staff shortages for the delays. More than half also said that NHS managers do not give wet AMD a high enough priority. Staff shortages mean non-medical workers are being drafted in to give sight-saving treatment in many hospitals. Bernie Chang, chairman of professional standards at the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, said: ‘Most ophthalmic departments are finding it difficult to cope with demand for this treatment and a third are now using non-medical staff to give injections. ‘We need a significant increase in capacity to be able to deliver services that are sufficient, as well as efficient. It is essential not to give this treatment late as vision will be lost unnecessarily.’ Tony Rucinski, chief executive of the Macular Society, said: ‘We know many areas of the NHS are struggling, but elderly people with AMD need and deserve proper care. It is devastating to lose your vision. Rising demand from an ageing population and financial pressures mean patients suffering from conditions such as AMD are not getting the help they need in time, it is claimed . ‘There will be hundreds of thousands of patients with wet AMD in the coming years. The cost to individuals and to society of not treating them properly will be enormous.’ Bev Langton, 61, from Wem in Shropshire, has been helping her mother battle to get her appointments for wet AMD treatment within the time limits recommended by her consultant. She said: ‘My mother is in her 90th year. The clinical care at Shrewsbury Hospital has been excellent, but there has been a constant frustration that the appointment waiting times are consistently much longer than the consultant recommends. ‘It is frustrating, and we have to question whether the constant delays have caused my mum any avoidable sight loss.’","Thousands of patients are suffering from age-related macular degeneration .

"A skull dating back to the 1600s has been found in Australia, casting doubt over whether Captain Cook really was the first European to land on the east coast of the country. In preparation for a murder investigation, police ran carbon dating tests on the intact human skull  but results showed it was a lot older than first expected. Results found that the skull, found near Taree a large town about 200 miles north of Sydney recently, could date back to the mid-1600s, 120 years before Captain Cook landed in Australia. Here before Captain Cook? Carbon dating of this skull found in Australia recently suggested that the person, a white male, was born in the mid-1600s, almost 100 years before Captain Cook arrived in the country . Expert Stewart Fallon from the Australian National University, who did the carbon dating, was shocked to discover the age of the artefact, which tests confirmed was the male skull of a white European. He told AFP: ‘We didn't know how old this one was. We assumed at first that it was going to be a very young sample. ‘When we first did it we weren't really thinking about people coming to Australia and things like that until we started to look at the dates and say, “Oh, that's becoming intriguing”.’ Dr Fallon said that carbon dating for dates after 1950 was very accurate but anything earlier was less clear. Two samples for the skull indicated two different dates but both were within the error range. He suggested there was a good chance that the man was born in the mid-1600s. 'Intriguing': Dr Stewart Fallon said carbon dating results suggested, with 80 per cent probability, that the skull was of a man born in the mid-1600s which came as a shock because he thought the remains were much younger on first inspection . He said: ‘Using [the dates] together we can do some modelling as to what we expect the calendar age to be ... and the way it works out by using those two dates is that we get about an 80 per cent probability that the person was born somewhere around the 1650s and died somewhere between 1660 and 1700. The other possibility, which Dr Fallon gave a one-in-five probability, was that the man was born between 1780 and 1790, and died between 1805 and 1810. Historians have been cautious about the discovery, suggesting it does not necessarily refute Captain Cook’s claim. Archaeologist Adam Ford said that because the skull was found without other remains, it could have been imported as part of a private collection. He told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph: . ‘Before we rewrite the history of European settlement we have to . consider a number of issues, particularly the circumstances of the . discovery. Don't rewrite history just yet: Historians have been cautious with one suggesting that the skull (right) may have been imported to Australia as part of a private collection because it was found without other remains. Captain Cook (left) reached the east coast of Australia in 1770 . ‘The fact the skull is in good condition and found alone could easily point to it coming from a private collection and skulls were very popular with collectors in the 19th century.’ Cassie Mercer, an Australian historical researcher said: ‘If the skull does pre-date British settlement, it may be a tragic yet fascinating clue to the little-known history of early interactions between First Australians and the outside world.’ Detective Sergeant John Williamson said: ‘The DNA determined the skull . was a male and the anthropologist report states the skull is that of a . Caucasoid aged anywhere from 28 to 65.’ Captain Cook is thought to be the first white person to reach the east coast of Australia when he reached shore in April 1770. He declared the east British soil, four months later. Dutch explorers reached the north and west coasts in the early 1600s.","Carbon dating of the skull suggests it is of a man born in the mid-1600s .

"Taxpayers are being charged $33 million to save 800 birds who are living on an old section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge which is no longer in use. The double-crested cormorants, which are protected but not endangered, have lived on a decrepit section of the bridge for decades. Despite the eastern section of the bridge being replaced with a new $6.4m span, the birds have refused to relocate, meaning officials have been unable to dismantle the old section which was damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake. Taxpayers are footing a $33 million bill to help relocate 800 double-crested comorants who have lived under a now replaced section of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge for decades . Officials have unsuccessfully used pricey decoys, bird recordings and have placed specially-made nests planted on the new bridge, to lure the birds some 100 feet. Critics say relocating the birds could end up costing them $33m. Given only 800 birds live on the bridge, the cost of moving each one is about $40,000. Radio show host Brian Sussman said that figure was 'more than most people in the United States make in a given year'. Fox News reports that relocation are set to soar further, because once the birds start laying eggs in February, the demolition process must stop completely. Taxpayers are spending another $12m to fast-track the process and a further million for netting to prevent more birds from settling in. And that's not the end of it. Transport officials say they'll probably need more time and money to complete the job. The eastern section of the bridge, damaged 25 years ago during the Loma Prieta earthquake, was replaced at a cost of $6.4 million, and officials now want to dismantle it . Oficials say they are bound by the law, and if they don't follow it, taxpayers could face an even bigger bill . Nearly a quarter of a million cars use the bridge each date. It has two sections. The western section, which is a suspension bridge and links San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the eastern section, which connects the island with Oakland. Callers to Mr Sussman's radio show offered less costly and speedier solutions to the bird problems, from blasting them with fire hoses, to hiring rocker and hunter Ted Nugent to shoot them with his bow and arrow. Mr Sussman blamed bird protection laws written in 1918 for the problem, but said changing the laws in the Bay Are would be hopeless. He said: 'You would have to go through hell and high water because there are so many avowed environmentalists that want that set in stone because, I believe, they see us as the invasive species.' California Department of Transportation spokesperson Leah Robinson Leach said the agency was required to follow the law and if they didn't do so, the penalties they could face 'could far exceed' the bird relocation costs. The demolition of the original section of the bridge is not expected to be completed until 2018.","Birds are protected, but not endangered, and have lived there for decades .

"Former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has been diagnosed with an advanced form of an unknown cancer. Doctors found ‘an advanced cancer of unknown origin’ that had metastasized, and that they were unable to find its source. The cancer was discovered in February by Menino's primary physician, Dr. Charles A. Morris. Menino is one of only 3 or 4 percent of patients in whom the precise origin of the cancer is unidentified. 'We'll get through it': Boston's longest serving mayor ever Thomas Menino has been diagnosed with advanced cancer of 'unknown origin.' Such diagnoses where the origin of the disease cannot be ascertained are only seen in around 3 or 4 percent of patients. The scrappy politician has vowed to fight the disaease . Menino, the longest-serving Boston mayor who retired from the office a year ago, is 71 and has had many health problems in recent years. He said Morris, after making the discovery, was more shaken that Menino. ‘My attitude really is, we'll get through it,’ Menino told the Boston Globe. Mayor Marty Walsh released a statement Saturday saying his thoughts and prayers are with Menino and his family. ‘I've never known Tom Menino to back down from a fight, and I don't expect him to start now,’ the statement said. ‘Mayor Menino has always been here for the people of Boston, and we're behind him today, 100%.’ Menino was admitted to the hospital several times while in office. In 2003, he underwent surgery to remove a rare sarcoma on his back. The following year, his doctors confirmed he has been diagnosed with Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. He spent six weeks in the hospital in 2012 for a series of ailments, including a respiratory infection. While he was in the hospital, he suffered a compression fracture in his spine and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. In May 2013, he was back in the hospital for surgery for an enlarged prostate. Menino served as Boston mayor for more than 20 years. Health problems forced him to decline to run for a sixth term.","Thomas Menino, 71, retired a year ago after record tenure as mayor that stretched past 20 years .

"Singer Gregg Allman, movie producers and a rail company are among those being sued by the parents of a 27-year-old camera assistant who died when a freight train struck a film crew in Georgia. The lawsuit targets 10 individuals associated with the film Midnight Rider, based on the Allman Brothers Band founder's autobiography. It also goes after eight corporations including CSX Transportation, which owns the railway tracks where the crash occurred, and Rayonier Performance Fibres, a subsidiary of forest-products manufacturer Rayonier that owns the land surrounding the crash site. Singer Gregg Allman (pictured) is among those being sued by the parents of Sarah Jones, 27, who died on the set of 'Midnight Rider' during pre-production in Georgia . Victim: Sarah Jones, from Atlanta, was killed when a freight train crossing the Altamaha River in south-east Georgia struck crew members filming on the railroad bridge . The lawsuit says film-makers 'selected an unreasonably dangerous site for the filming location; failed to secure approval for filming from CSX; concealed their lack of approval from CSX from the cast and crew ... and otherwise failed to take measures to protect the safety of the Midnight Rider cast and crew.' Allman, 66, was named as a defendant in his role as an executive producer on the film. Also included were director Randall Miller, his production company Unclaimed Freight Productions and several of his assistants on the film, along with companies assisting with the production. The lawsuit says Rayonier should be held accountable for allowing the film crew on to its property. It says a company employee wrongly told the crew 'only two trains would pass by on the railroad track per day'. It says CSX did not give permission for the crew to film on its tracks, but the company knew shooting would be taking place in the area and should have taken precautions. 'Despite the fact that multiple CSX trains passed the Midnight Rider cast and crew on February 20, with those individuals in view of the trains' operators, no warning was given to the subsequent train that ultimately caused Sarah's death,' the lawsuit said. Mrs Jones's parents Richard Jones (right) and Elizabeth (left) have filed the lawsuit which targets ten individuals and eight corporations . Scene: Investigators say CSX Railroad, which owns the train tracks, denied giving producers a permit to be on the tracks themselves . Production on Midnight Rider had just begun on February 20 when a freight train crossing the Altamaha River in south-east Georgia struck crew members filming on the railroad bridge. Ms Jones, from Atlanta, was killed and six other crew members were injured. Sheriff's investigators in rural Wayne County, where the crash occurred, say Mr Miller's crew had permission to be on the property abutting the bridge. But investigators say CSX Railroad, which owns the train tracks, denied giving producers a permit to be on the tracks themselves. The train smashed into a metal-framed bed that the film crew had placed across the tracks. Richard Jones, right, sits next to wife Elizabeth as they sit in their attorney's office while talking about their daughter Sarah Jones last month . Producers suspended work on the movie indefinitely the following week. Actor William Hurt, who was playing Allman and was at the scene of the crash, later issued a statement saying he informed producers he would no longer work on the film. Authorities have yet to decide whether to file criminal charges in the case. CSX spokesman Kristin Seay said the company had not seen the lawsuit and had no immediate comment. Mr Miller's lawyer, Donnie Dixon, said he was 'unaware of any details' and did not comment further. Russell Schweiss, Rayonier's director of corporate communications, said the company had not been served with the lawsuit and would address it through the courts.","Lawsuit accuses singer, producers and others of being responsible for death .

"She is the world's most famous sea dog who went down with her ship almost 500 years ago. But now it has emerged that Hatch, who drowned with the crew of the Mary Rose and the only known female aboard, was male. DNA testing of the crew has revealed the true sex of the unfortunate hound, who acquired the nickname Hatch after divers found the dog's remains near the sliding hatch door of the Mary Rose's carpenter's cabin. Scroll down for video . New DNA test results have revealed that Hatch - the world's most famous sea dog - was in fact a male . The Mary Rose sank on July 19, 1545, taking with her 500 men and Hatch the dog . Experts believe the hound, estimated to have been between 18 months and two years old, earned her keep as the ship's ratter – superstitious Tudor seafarers did not have cats on board ship as they were thought to bring bad luck. Hatch's remains went on display four years ago at the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth, where some of the 19,000 objects from Henry VIII's ill-fated flagship are on show. The well-preserved skeleton of the hound, which has just a few teeth and paw bones missing, was excavated when it was brought to the surface of the Solent in 1982. Without DNA testing available, experts had to arrange the dog's bones by hand and came to the conclusion that Hatch was a female because of the size and characteristics of the bones. They were also able to establish from the size, shape and composition that Hatch did not receive much exercise. The ship was rediscovered in 1971 and between 1979 and 1982 the entire contents of the ship were excavated . The Mary Rose, which was completed in 1512, sank as she defended England from a French invasion force . But the new DNA test results published in Forensic Science International Journal detail more accurate details about the dog. Maritime archaeologist Alex Hildred, who co-authored the new report, told the Independent: 'Genomic DNA extraction is something that we have only recently been able to use in amplifying ancient DNA. It can give us the sex, colourings, coat and regressive genes and confirm that Hatch is in fact a boy dog.' The testing also suggests Hatch shared many genetic characteristics with the modern breed of Jack Russell. The hound was most likely a cross-breed which shared some similarities with a whippet but with a dark brown and curly coat. On May 31 last year, the new £35 million museum was opened in Portsmouth which shows off the artefacts raised . After 34 years at sea and three wars, the Mary Rose had been regarded by many as invincible. Then, as she defended England from a French invasion force, she sank taking with her 500 men and a treasure trove of Tudor history with her to the seafloor on July 19, 1545. The ship was rediscovered by divers in 1971 and between 1979 and 1982 the entire contents of the ship were excavated resulting in the recovery of around 20,000 objects. Last year, a new £35million museum was unveiled in Portsmouth which shows off many thousands of the artefacts raised from the wreck.","Hatch drowned with the crew of the Mary Rose on July 19, 1545 .

"Controversial: Malawi President Bingu wa Mutharika had won power in the African state in 2004, but was unpopular among his countrymen . Bingu wa Mutharika, the controversial president of Malawi who saw the country fall into economic crisis, has died from a heart attack, it was reported today. The 78-year-old leader, reviled by many in his own country and the international community, was rushed to hospital after collapsing on Thursday, but could not be saved. Malawi state media said Mutharika had been flown out to South Africa for treatment, although the current whereabouts of his body remains unclear, according to Reuters. Medical sources told news agency the leader was flown from Lilongwe hospital because the power and energy crisis in Malawi is so severe the hospital could not carry out a proper autopsy or even keep his body refrigerated. Mutharika had become widely disliked by Malawians since becoming leader seven years ago, as many blamed him personally for the nation's crippling economic woes. As rumours of the death of the self-styled 'Economist in Chief' swept the capital on Thursday night, there were even pockets of drunken jubilation among locals who saw him turning back the clock on 18 years of democracy in the 'Warm Heart of Africa'. The country of 13 million had suffered chronic fuel shortages in recent months which led in turn to pump prices soaring by 30 per cent. The African country also teetered on the brink of civil unrest following various protests outside government buildings last year. Campaign: Mutharika, pictured in 2009, became involved in a diplomatic spat with Britain last year after David Cameron said he would cut aid to countries which do not support gay rights . The controversial statesman was condemned by the international community in July when more than a dozen people died after he deployed the army to crush protests against his government. At the end of last year Mutharika had to call an impromptu telephone press conference to confirm he was still alive, amid rumours he had died when he vanished from view. In November last year, Mutharika disappeared from Malawi during its economic crisis in order to take a holiday in Hong Kong. Rumours of his death came just three months after Mutharika sacked his entire cabinet, assuming every position himself. New wife: President Mutharika at his wedding to Callista Chapola-Chimombo in April last year . The statesman appointed new people to most of the roles, including several members of his own family. Britain had endured strained relations with Malawi and Mutharika, as the tyrant had lashed out against the UK amid speculation it was to cut its aid to developing countries who failed to protect gay rights. In Malawi, homosexuality is illegal and punishable by prison. The late president's brother and Malawi's foreign minister, Aurther-Peter Mutharika, is the heir apparent to the position and could be set to take over.","Controversial leader collapsed on Thursday but could not be saved .

"Prince Charles has delivered an impassioned plea to save the spiralling number of over-50s shattered by redundancy from the scrapheap. He spoke from the heart about the ‘lack of value’ suffered by many of the estimated 425,000 middle-aged men and women currently unemployed in Britain. But he also talked with pride about a charity he has set up to help mature workers who are out of a job or facing the threat of redundancy to start their own business. Prince Charles talked with pride about a charity he has set up to . help mature workers who are out of a job or facing the threat of . redundancy to start their own business . PRIME – The Prince’s Initiative For Mature Enterprise – is the only organisation of its kind in the country to offer business advice and mentoring to older people and has already helped more than 23,000 in England and Wales. Charles said: ‘People feel they have no value any more and once you’re made redundant clearly it’s very difficult. ‘The great thing about all this effort is that no one should be afraid of backing someone because of their age because at the end of the day, if it’s a good idea, it’s a good idea, whatever age you are. ‘So we aim, through PRIME, to show that there’s still life in the old dog yet! And so often we find that over-50s who start their own businesses actually are more sustainable, in terms of a percentage of the success rate, than those who are younger. ‘So I think probably age and experience and wisdom does help you.’ Speaking at St James’s Palace after a reception to celebrate the entrepreneurs PRIME has helped to create, Charles, who turns 65 himself this year, could barely hide his frustration that so many older people are effectively being put out to pasture after redundancy. Support: Charles, who turns 65 himself this year, hosted a reception at St. James's Palace, where guests included actress Lynda Bellingham (pictured) He talked about the dent in self-confidence that a once working, productive member of society can experience when they suddenly lose their job – ‘a crying shame’, he said – when so many still need to provide for their families and have a desire to contribute. Figures from the Office for National Statistics highlight the nightmare facing a generation of older people when they are made redundant in their 50s. Since the recession began in 2008, the number of unemployed people aged 50 and above has rocketed by nearly 80 per cent to 425,000. Of the total, one in four has been desperately looking for work without success for more than two years – which means self-employment is a hugely attractive proposition. Charles said that while he was proud of the work that his more well-known charity, The Prince’s Trust, had done in helping young people on to the job ladder, he felt that there was an equally important – and vulnerable – section of society that needed his help. PRIME, set up in 1999, has actively helped to set up more than 5,000 businesses, with a surge of people seeking support in recent years. Charles said: ‘People were writing to me, they still do, that there isn’t anything out there to give them any help. ‘We can help people who want to develop a hobby sometimes into a viable business. We run courses which give them an idea about enterprise and business plans and how you manage cashflow and marketing and all these things, and provide them with a mentor. ‘We need to spread the word that PRIME exists and we’re here to help.’ Read more at www.prime.org.uk .","Talked with pride about PRIME - The Prince's Initiative For Mature Enterprise .

"The pretty young girl is so drunk on cheap alcohol she’s lying comatose on a pavement in a torn T-shirt and minuscule shorts on a bitterly cold winter night. Another staggers along wearing ripped fishnet stockings and shorts that leave little more to the imagination than a lap dancer’s G-string. A third leans over the pavement on the point of collapse as an unsteady friend grabs her arms in a drunken gesture of solidarity. Scroll down for video . This young women ended up on the pavement during the night out in Liverpool . Hundreds of revellers took to the streets of Liverpool city centre last night for the latest Carnage pub crawl . Young women braved the bitter cold wearing tiny shorts and ripped t-shirts as part of the fancy dress event . Many other young women are supporting each other as they walk to stop themselves falling into the gutter. No, these are not members of a hen party or a group of silly wannabe WAGS; they are just a few of the hundreds of university students in Liverpool who were out for a night on the town this weekend. They were ‘enjoying’ — if that is the word — an organised pub crawl laid on by Carnage UK. The Carnage UK events are run by Varsity Leisure Group, a multi-million-pound business that puts on hundreds of pub crawls throughout Britain, selling souvenir T-shirts for students who partake. Young men dressed in bow ties and joked around in the street as part of the event last night . The event, the third in this university year, includes alcoholic drinks for £1 and claims to offer students the 'best night of their lives' Revellers take to the streets of Liverpool city centre as part of the latest Carnage pub crawl . Young men bare their chests as they make their way along the pub crawl . This young man ended up on the cobbled street in Liverpool on the night of the event . The 'Playboys vs Bunnies' themed event attracted hundreds of revellers who enjoyed drinking cheap alcohol before spilling out into Liverpool's famous Concert Square . Carnage UK events, which are organised by Varsity Leisure Group, have come under fire in the past for promoting excessive drinking . Revellers patiently wait in line as they take part in the fancy dress event (left) while a drunk, young woman gets support from a fellow reveller (right) An amorous couple appear to be getting close while revellers in the background continue having fun . One reveller appeared to suffer a wardrobe malfunction after laddering her fishnet tights while many of the young revellers appeared to enjoy themselves on the night out . Lured by alcohol from £1 a shot, and the . promise they would have the ‘best night of their lives’, the students . were all dressed for the event’s theme of Playboy vs Bunnies — an . imaginative variant on Carnage UK’s previous parties: Nympho Nurses And . Dirty Doctors, and Pimps And Hoes (whores). If this is the best night of . their lives, I shudder to imagine what their worst is. Why is it that such well-educated young women feel the only way they can have fun and express themselves is by dressing like tarts and drinking themselves into oblivion? Two young women crouch down to speak during the Carnage event in Liverpool . Police and paramedics were on hand throughout the night and kept a close eye on the event . And it’s not just Liverpool — it is happening in university towns throughout the country. What is it that encourages them to ape the worst behaviour of men? Is there some neo-feminist version of equality that compels them to behave like football hooligans? Of course, we expect the young to enjoy themselves at university, not least because many of them have left home for the first time and should relish their new-found freedom. We don’t want them all to be bookworms confined in dusty libraries at all hours. But this kind of drinking, this knock-it-back-until-you-pass-out mentality, seems so utterly nihilistic: devoid of almost any purpose other than getting the next cheap shot. Sure we used to drink when I was at university, but never like this. It is as if getting annihilated on drink is the only reason to party at campuses today — even for normally sensible, well-educated girls. The Carnage event held last night in Liverpool was the third in this university year . The peer pressure to conform is intense. And so instead of using university to help define themselves as individuals, to soak up knowledge and wisdom, they revert to a herd mentality.That herd mentality is all too apparent, as well, in the latest drinking craze of NekNomination — in which people post videos of themselves on Facebook and other social media sites, daring others to outdrink them. It’s a craze that has already claimed a number of lives, and so far it seems to be mainly confined to men, although it can only be a matter of time before girls feel they have to get in on it. And whatever anyone says about equality, the plain fact is that drunken women are far more vulnerable than drunken men. A young woman appears to be offering support to her friend during the night out (left) while other make their way down the cobbled street . A young woman dresses up as a bunny for the fancy dress event (left). Many of the other young women at the event wore tiny shorts . While the drinking appeared to have taken its toll on some party-goers others called it a night and poured into take-away shops for food . A young woman gives her friend a piggy-back during the event in Liverpool . As the agony aunt Irma Kurtz said recently, a woman when drunk puts herself at more risk of rape and sexual assaults. She was pilloried for stating the obvious. But if you get drunk with the boys, you are incapable of self-defence. What chance would that Liverpool lass in our main picture lying drunk in the street have of fending off a man? Would she even remember what happened in the morning? For educated, career women of my generation, it is unfathomable that those who follow the path we cleared to equality should choose to squander the great privileges they now have. Women outnumber and outperform men at even our top universities. They have the best chance of fulfilling their dreams of any generation. Yet I don’t know a single boss who would now employ a graduate without first checking their Facebook and social media accounts. Perhaps these young women might give a thought to their future before so recklessly throwing it away on a moment of drunken madness.","Carnage event claims to offer students the 'best night of their lives'

"One direction: Sabine Moreau was meant to pick up a friend at the station in Brussels, but took a wrong turn and ended up 900 miles away in Zagreb . A Belgian woman took an astonishing 1,800 mile detour through six countries after her car navigation system went wrong. Sabine Moreau, 67, had intended to drive to Brussels from her home in Solre-sur-Sambre to pick up a friend from the train station - a journey of just 38 miles. But she took a catastrophic wrong turn and eventually ended up 900 miles away in Zagreb, Croatia. Despite crossing five borders and seeing multiple-language traffic signs, she did not stop to question her sat-nav until two days later when she realised that she may not be in Belgium any more. Although she stopped to refuel her car . several times, Ms Moreau did not think her TomTom could be leading her . down the wrong path. ‘I saw . all kinds of traffic signs. First in French, then in German - Cologne, . Aachen, Frankfurt,’ she told a Belgian news website. ‘But I didn't ask myself any questions. I was just distracted, so I kept my foot down,’ she added. Police believe she crossed through France, Germany, Austria and Slovenia before finally getting to Croatia. Then she faced another 900 mile journey back to get to her home in Solre-sur-Sambre. By this stage her worried son had reported her missing to police. Officers searched her house and . were about to launch a full scale manhunt when she phoned home to say . she was in Zagreb. She told . police: ‘I didn't really notice anything was wrong until I suddenly . arrived in Zagreb and realised that I was no longer in Belgium.’ Long journey: Police believe Ms Moreau's TomTom led her from Belgium through France, Germany, Austria and Slovenia through to Croatia .

So preoccupied that even after being forced to stop for petrol several times - as well as a snooze on the side of the road - Ms Moreau still did not question her satnav. 'I stopped several times for petrol and paid with my credit card. When I felt tired I stopped for a few hours sleep in the car on a lay-by,' she said. 'I was a bit absent-minded as I had a few things to think about, I suppose.' Ms Moreau finally made it home 60 hours after embarking upon her inadvertent odyssey. A spokesman for police in Belgium, who had been on the brink of launching a hunt for Ms Moreau after being alerted by her son, said: 'This is an incredible story. 'These GPS systems cause problems from time to time but nothing like this. But this woman has done nothing wrong and we just have to believe her,' he added.

"On Tuesday it will be one year since two pressure cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring scores of others. As the anniversary draws close, survivors and families of those who lost their lives reflect on the past 12 months and talk of their hopes for the future. Over the past year, a city shaken by an . unthinkable act of terrorism has returned to its usual rhythms - sadder, . but some say stronger, as well. 'I have to tell you, honestly, Boston is . a better city now than it was before,' Thomas Menino, who was Mayor at the time, said. 'People learned how to . deal with each other, they had to deal with a tragedy.' Staying strong: Roseann Sdoia lost part of her leg in the bombing but has refused to let her injury stop her . Motivation: Roseann works out at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital as she focuses on being able to run again . Roseann Sdoia Roseann had been cheering on friends at the finish line when the bombs exploded on April 15. The 42-year-old, who was standing close to where the second device detonated, lost part of her right leg and developed hearing trouble. Despite her ordeal Miss Sdoia's optimism remained intact and she refused to give into her injuries, even if it meant navigating the staircases in her apartment building. 'Early on when all this happened, so many people were telling me to move out of the city and move out of my apartment because of the stairs and I don't have an elevator and parking is not very convenient,' she said. 'But I have been able to get past all of that.' But the vice-president of a property management company said she still cries every day. 'What is sinking in is this is for life - that it is how I have to live, how I have to walk. What is sinking in is that life has changed,' she said. Miss Sdoia is determined to get back to her hobby of running, and has hour-long workouts with a physical therapist twice a week. Business as usual: Despite losing her leg, Roseann still drives and lives in her walk up apartment . New beginnnings: Roseann Sdoia with firefighter Mike Materia. The pair fell in love after he helped save her life . 'Other than losing the bottom of my right leg, I'm still me ... I am still the same person I was before,' she said. One other big change for Miss Sdoia was the unexpected romance that blossomed between her and firefighter Mike Materia, who held her hand all the way to hospital. 'He has been there through thick and thin, since day one. He has literally seen me at my worst,' she said. 'If I have a bad hair day, I ask him, ""Am I having a bad hair day?"" and he answers, ""No, I've seen you have a worse one"".' She has yet to decide whether to go to the marathon this year but if she does she will have her family and friends at her side, as well as the three first-responders who saved her live - Shores Salter, a Northeastern University student used his belt as a tourniquet on her bleeding leg; Shana Cottone, a Boston cop; and Materia. Inspired: Marc Fucarile, who lost a leg and has shrapnel in his heart, waves a Boston Strong flag with finacée Jen Regan at a hockey match . Ordeal: Marc's right leg had to be amputated and it is possible he will lose part of his left leg too . Marc Fucarile Everything has changed for 35-year-old former roofer, Mr Fucarile, who lost his right leg above the knee, has shrapnel in his heart and risks losing his left leg too. But despite having to adapt to the appalling injuries he suffered at the finish line, the wave of generosity he has experienced since has inspired Mr Fucarile to help others. 'It's been mind-blowing. ... All these good people who stepped out, who helped us, helped so many of us,' he said. 'All the victims I know feel the same way. Complete strangers who give, when they don't have.' The father of a six-year-old boy spent 45 days in hospital after the bombing and has been unable to return to work because of his injuries. 'Everything has changed. How I use the bathroom, how I shower, how I brush my teeth, how I get in and out of bed,' he said. He added that his son, Gavin, is also struggling to adapt and understand why his father is limited in what he can now do. 'Gavin is like, ""Hey, you want to go out . and play?"" and I'm like, ""There's a foot of snow. I can't do snow. We're . not going out and playing right now, sorry buddy"". It breaks my heart.' 'Everything has changed': Marc says he and his six-year-old son are still struggling to adapt to his injuries . Change: Moved by the generosity of those around him, Marc now plans to be a motivational speaker . Mr Fucarile received $1.1 million from the One . Fund to pay for his medical needs, and a fund has raised $184,000 for . other needs but he still has huge out-of-pocket expenses caused by his injuries. Inspired by the generosity shown to him however, Mr Fucarile is determined to get back to an active life, so he can help others. He plans to become a . motivational speaker and to set up a fund to help those who have . suffered similar injuries, no matter the circumstances. Loss: Police officer Sean Collier was shot dead by the bombers during the manhunt that followed the attack . Tribute: Collier's sister, Nicole Lynch, holds a plaque in his honor. The family have started a fund in his memory to help train police officers . Sean Collier Police Officer Collier was shot dead by one of the bombers during the manhunt that followed the attack. For his family, including sister Nicole Lynch, the anniversary of the bombing will be hard but they plan to attend the marathon to cheer on a team running in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology officer. Ms Lynch is still grieving for her brother, and said: 'Every now and then it kind of hits you again, like ""Wow, this is real"".' In memory of her brother, the family have set up a scholarship fund that will pay for one student a year to be trained in law enforcement. A group of 25 people, including two of Officer Collier's siblings, will enter the marathon this year under Team Collier Strong to raise funds for the scholarship - and Ms Lynch and her family will be there to support them. Grief: Nicole Lynch is still overwhelmed by the loss of her brother, Sean Collier . Ed Deveau The Massachusetts Police Chief is doing his best to make sure Boston stays strong. As he spoke to AP on the street where the brothers behind the attack exchanged gunfire with police, he refused to say their names. 'You'll get me to say, ""older brother, younger brother"" ... I think they get way too much attention,' he said. 'They tried to put fear in this city and they failed miserably.' Police Chief Deveau will run the marathon next week with 11 other Watertown police officers. Nine of them have never run a marathon before. Never again: Massachusetts police chief Ed Deveau says the bombers failed in their attempt to bring fear . William Evans The Boston Police Superintendent, who has run the marathon 18 times and finished just before the bombs went off last year, will be at the race again this year - but not as a runner. The police commissioner will be superivising the extended security arrangements, which includes 3,500 officers which is more than twice the number last year, as well as bomb-sniffing dogs, extra cameras and safety restrictions on what runners and spectators can carry with them. 'It weighs heavy on my mind, that I want this to go off well. I don't want anyone hurt. I don't ever want a repeat of the tragedy we saw that day,' he said. On guard: Marathon runner and Boston police commissioner William Evans will be at the race next week overseeing an increased security operation . The past year has not been easy for Boston, which was gripped by fear by the terrorist attack that led to the city being locked down for the manhunt that followed the bombings. But it has been able to move on. The impromptu tributes that filled Copley Square have been moved to a display in the Public Library, where every teddy bear of pair of sneakers act as a sign on unity. The Red Sox, who wore Boston Strong patches through their epic ride to the championship last year  are playing ball again. 'The city really came together after the Red Sox won the World Series,' Mary Ellen Cahill, of Canton, said. 'It was such a moment of unity and togetherness ... We are unified, not terrified.'","Family of officer Sean Collier who was shot by bombers are due to run this year in his honor .

With the intense press speculation and public interest surrounding the birth, the couple couldn't be blamed for maintaining a shred of privacy by misleading the nation on the official due date. Especially after they lost the opportunity to keep Kate's pregnancy under wraps until she reached the three month mark after she was admitted to hospital last November with severe morning sickness. Of course, the due date is only ever an estimation of when a baby will arrive and as palace sources have confirmed the Duchess will not be having an caesarian, nobody will be able to predict when her labour will begin naturally. Kate's last official public engagement was the Trooping of the Colour on 15 June. Ready to put her feet up: Kate's last official public engagement was the Trooping of the Colour where Prince Harry made her laugh on the palace balcony . Missed nuptials: Prince William attended a wedding in Northumberland at the weekend with his brother while pregnant Kate stayed at home . The Duchess, 31, is well-aware her son or daughter could arrive even earlier than expected and so missed the wedding of her friends Thomas Van Straubenzee and Lady Melissa Percy at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland at the weekend. Prince William, 31, attended the nuptials with his brother Prince Harry, 28, while Kate forwent the trip to the North East to instead be nearer the London hospital where she will give birth. The Palace have said she intends to have the baby in the Lindo Wing at St Mary's, Paddington, where Diana gave birth to both William and Harry. They also revealed that Marcus Setchell, the Queen’s former gynaecologist, will deliver the baby, aided by the Queen’s current gynaecologist Alan Farthing, the former fiance of the murdered BBC presenter Jill Dando. As previously reported in the Daily Mail, the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child - a future heir to the throne - will be announced in exactly the same way as Prince William's to retain 'the theatre' of a genuine royal occasion. Early announcement: The couple had to go public with their happy news before the pregnancy reached the three month mark after Kate was admitted to hospital with severe morning sickness . Royal repeat: The baby will be delivered on the Lindo Wing of St Mary's hospital just as Prince William was . Theatre of notice: And just as when Prince William was born, a sign announcing the birth will be displayed in the grounds of Buckingham Palace . As soon as the baby is born, a proclamation signed by doctors who delivered the boy or girl will be rushed from the ward and displayed at the gates of Buckingham Palace within minutes. 'We wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice. It is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands. This is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne. It is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence,' a Palace spokesman said. ‘It is very important [to us] that it will not be announced first on Twitter, although it will be announced on Twitter in due course.’ However, if the baby is born between 10.30pm and 8am, the news will be sent out via press release with the easel being erected later that morning, at around 9am. Palace sources have also made clear the birth will not be made public until the Queen and senior members of the royal family have been informed  - and, of course, the Middletons, in the unlikely scenario that they are not at the hospital.","Official due date announced as July 13 .

"A picture has emerged of the boy who survived a 230-foot fall from a seaside cliff in Bodega Bay, California, after landing on a rocky beach. The child was named by Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital spokesman Kevin Kimbrough  as Sebastion Johnson, who said he is in a critical but stable condition. Sebastion was on a family outing on a trail in Bodega Bay on Monday evening when he suddenly couldn't be found,The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. A picture has emerged of the boy who survived a 230-foot fall from a seaside cliff in Bodega Bay - named as Sebastion Johnson . Rescue teams rushed to Bodega Head in Northern California to take the boy to hospital (pictured) Paramedics are pictured putting Sebastion into the ambulance after his accident . Bodega Bay Fire Department rescuers spotted him on the beach at the bottom of the cliff. Two firefighter-paramedics rappelled down with a rescue basket and reached the boy, with help from illumination flares fired into the air from a Coast Guard motor lifeboat. Fire Capt. Justin Fox said: 'He was at the water line and it was low tide. If it was high tide, he wouldn't have been easy to find.' Fox says the boy was awake and crying by the time he was loaded into an ambulance and rushed to a hospital. It's the second rescue in Bodega Bay in three days, after a woman, 23, slipped 20 feet while climbing rocks in Bodega Head.

"Trolleys splashed with blood, curtain rails covered in dust and very suspicious brown marks on the shower floor. These were the horrific findings of hospital inspectors - despite the some of equipment in question being marked, quite incredibly, as 'clean'. The authority responsible for the hospital in question, Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, has now been reported to the Scottish Government over repeated failures to meet hygiene standards. Numerous pieces of equipment contaminated with blood or body fluids were found by staff from the Healthcare Environment Inspectorate (HEI) when they first visited on September 16 and 17. 'Dirt' on a shower room floor at the Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride. The NHS board responsible for the hospital has now been reported to the Scottish Government over patient safety concerns . The underside of a patient trolley contaminated with blood, found during an unannounced visit by inspectors . During the visit, inspectors found 'significant amounts of dust and grime' in several areas of the hospital. On their follow-up visit, inspectors were told that more people, equivalent to eight full-time staff, had been recruited to the housekeeping service. They found that the standard of environmental cleaning in the wards and departments inspected had improved. However, they noted faecal contamination to the panels at the back of two communal toilets and on one toilet wall, and faecal contamination on the nurse call bell beside a toilet. They called for immediate action to minimise the risk of infection and returned unannounced on October 3 to assess whether there had been improvements. But on their second visit, staff again found patient equipment contaminated with blood and body fluids. This included four patient trolleys and a bed frame, as well as five commodes which were tagged as clean. The HEI has now issued seven requirements and three recommendations for NHS Lanarkshire to address, and has raised its concerns with the Scottish Government. It found 'significant improvements' are needed to ensure the environment and patient equipment in all wards and departments are clean. Inspectors also said that standard infection control practices need to be recorded accurately in the data management system to target areas where improvement is needed. HEI chief inspector Susan Brimelow said: 'I am extremely disappointed by the findings from this inspection. Inspectors also found splashes of 'body fluid' on seated scales at the hospital during the second visit . 'Significant amounts of dust and grime' in several areas of the hospital, the hygiene report found . 'During inspection on September 16 and 17, we found patient equipment which was not clean and a poor standard of environmental cleanliness in all wards and departments inspected. 'We escalated our concerns to senior management on September 17 2014 and requested that immediate action be taken to minimise the risk of infection. 'We also asked NHS Lanarkshire to produce an improvement action plan to show how these issues would be rectified. 'On Friday October 3, we returned unannounced, to ensure improvements had been made and to assess progress with the improvement action plan. 'Although we saw some areas of improvement, issues with the cleanliness of patient equipment and the environment remained. 'Due to the serious nature of our findings, I escalated my concerns to the Scottish Government. 'We will continue to inspect Hairmyres Hospital to ensure that improvements are made, as every patient coming into hospital should expect their local hospital to be safe and clean.' However, inspectors did find some areas of good practice such as good hand hygiene and use of the correct personal protective equipment. Substantial improvements' are needed to ensure the environment and patient equipment in all wards and departments are clean, the inspectors said . Ian Ross, chief executive of NHS Lanarkshire, said: 'We are sorry that we fell below our own high standards of cleanliness of patient equipment and the environment at Hairmyres Hospital. 'We have acted swiftly to put in place a comprehensive action plan to address these issues. This includes making our systems more robust so there is assurance that patient equipment is clean and ready to use. 'We are also putting in place a system of firm supervision to monitor cleaning tasks giving us full confidence that our wards and departments are meeting a high standard of environmental cleanliness. 'I want to reassure patients and visitors that we have already made substantial improvements at Hairmyres Hospital following the HEI visits. 'Further progress against our action plan will be closely monitored by the NHS Lanarkshire board, which is committed to ensuring all our hospitals provide a safe and clean environment.' Health Secretary Alex Neil said: 'This inspection report reveals unacceptable standards in Hairmyres Hospital and I've been clear that NHS Lanarkshire must address the issues highlighted, and ensure that the failures of the PFI provider in relation to cleaning standards specified in the contract are addressed as a matter of priority. 'It is extremely important that patients and the public continue to have confidence in the cleanliness of Scottish hospitals and the quality of NHS Scotland services - that is why we have introduced these inspections as one of a range of measures to tackle healthcare associated infections.'","Some of the equipment had been marked as 'clean' by hospital staff .

"A coroner called for a review of powerboat training after a jury yesterday ruled that the deaths of a TV executive and his daughter were both accidents. Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight year old daughter Emily were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn. At the end of a two-day inquest into both deaths, the senior coroner for Cornwall Dr Emma Carlyon said she will write to the Royal Yachting Association to ask if it is ‘appropriate to review the advice for the level of training required for powerboats.’ Nick Milligan (left), 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (right) were killed when his out of control speedboat hit them after they were thrown into the water following a high speed turn. Her call followed an emotional plea from Mr Milligan’s older brother Brigadier Mark Milligan for safety lessons to be learnt from the tragedy, during which Nick’s wife Victoria and the couple’s other three children were also flung into the water as the 300 horsepower craft raced round in circles inflicting terrible injuries on the family. Mrs Milligan, 40, lost the lower part of her left leg. Kit, then four, was also hit by the propeller and needed 12 operations to save one of his legs. Daughters Amber, 13, and Olivia, 12, escaped with minor wounds. Brigadier Milligan, 54, who attended the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, with his wife Louise, said: ‘The power in some of these craft is such that in some circumstances they can be life-threatening. ‘The organisations need to take things more seriously than they have in the past. Powerboats are now more powerful than they used to be. Incidents have more devastating effects than ever before.’ Asked by the coroner what he would like to see done, he said the difference between training, qualifications and licences in the UK and in other countries around Europe should be looked at. Mrs Milligan (right) took the helm of the vessel from her husband Nick (left) but did attach the 'kill cord'.  She wept as she told the inquest that was her ‘big mistake’ ‘Abroad it’s compulsory to take certain courses whereas in the UK it’s voluntary,’ said Brigadier Milligan, who lives near Bath, Somerset. He suggested ‘best practice’ from abroad should be considered to avoid a repeat of the tragedy. Nick Milligan and his family, from Wandsworth, South West London, were spending the weekend in their holiday home near St Endoc, Cornwall, when the Bank Holiday tragedy happened around 3.45pm on Sunday May 5 last year. After completing several laps of the picturesque Camel Estuary north of Padstow at around 30 knots - or roughly 30 mph - in the rigid inflatable boat, called Milly, Mr Milligan took off the ‘kill cord’, which links the wearer’s leg to the ignition and cuts the engine if they fall overboard, because he needed ‘a wee’ as they headed back to shore, the inquest heard. Mrs Milligan then took the helm but did not attach the device. She wept as she told the inquest that was her ‘big mistake’. The children then ‘all called out that they wanted to go round again,’ she said. The boat, seen being tailed by a local sailor attempting to bring it under control, hit the family after they fell into the water . She did not think there was enough room to turn, but her husband, managing director of Sky’s advertising sales division Sky Media, ‘grabbed the wheel with his right hand and accelerated with his left hand’, she said. Yesterday naval architect Lorne Campbell, who examined the boat for the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) after the tragedy, said an ‘error of judgement’ may have led to Mr Milligan pushing the throttle harder than anticipated. ‘The throttle controls move quite easily… he was not standing in the normal position where you would push it forward and back,’ he said. ‘I don’t think they would have foreseen it. This would have taken them by surprise.’ Mr and Mrs Milligan had each undertaken a powerboat training course run by the Royal Yachting Association. Instructors described Mr Milligan as a ‘keen, confident and responsible boat driver’ and his wife as ‘a very attentive student with a good level of risk awareness’, the inquest heard. But the MAIB report found the couple were unprepared for the boat’s reaction when it was turned at speed and then ‘hooked’ - the nautical equivalent of a car spinning - as they did not have the level of boat handling skills required to control such a turn. Captain Mike Evans, who led the MAIB investigation, told the inquest the training the couple received had not provided them with an understanding of how their boat would perform in a high speed turn. Tragedy: Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily (left) were in a speedboat with the rest of the family, Victoria and children (left to right) Olivia, Kit and Amber, when they were thrown from the boat and hit by the out of control vessel as it continued to circle in the water . The Royal Yachting Association accepted a recommendation from the MAIB to improve training earlier this year, he added. The other key safety issues identified by the MAIB were that the ‘kill cord’ was not attached to the driver and that the occupants should be seated, holding on and as far aft, or close to the stern, as possible when boats are travelling at speed. The couple’s four children were all sitting or standing at the front of the boat when they were thrown from it. Yesterday Susan Mann, a doctor who happened to be on a trip on another boat, said Mrs Milligan, whose leg was severed below the knee with the bone and tissue exposed, said, ‘My life is ruined’ and kept asking where her husband was as she tended to her after she was dragged from the water with Kit by a kayaker. Post-mortem examinations found Mr Milligan died from head injuries while Emily had suffered fatal multiple injuries. Victoria Milligan left the inquest after giving her evidence on Monday and did not attend the hearing yesterday when the jury returned their conclusions.","Nick Milligan and his daughter Emily, eight, were killed in speedboat tragedy .

"It was once the symbol of Gaddafi's strength over the west, a brutal image of power and victory. Now it stands ruined with the Mad Dog's illusion of power over the country shattered, like the windows in his once regal compound. Built in 1986, after the US air strikes in Libya, the iconic statue shows a fist crushing an American aircraft and was the majestic backdrop for many of the dictator's speeches. In a final gesture of contempt rebels forces climbed and painted the statue screaming victory as their dictator remains absent, presumably in hiding. Scroll down for video . Ransacked: Gaddafi's Bab Al Azaziya compound in Tripoli is trashed - the dictator's whereabouts is still unknown . Triumphant: Gaddafi used the gold fist statue as a backdrop to many speeches . RAF warplanes blasted missile launchers and a command bunker in Colonel Gaddafi’s home town of Sirte yesterday as rebel forces prepared to launch an attack. SAS men with Arab special forces were said to be carrying out reconnaissance for Nato and rebels around the Gaddafi stronghold for what  Libyan officials say could be the ‘last great battle’ of the war. Reports have claimed that the dictator and some of his sons are in the town together with thousands of his troops and clan fighters whose loyalty Gaddafi bought when he created Sirte as effectively his second capital. Fresh battles rage: A Libyan man runs across the street seeking shelter from sniper fire in Tripoli today . A rebel fighter shoots during an intense gun battle in Abu Salim, yesterday. Today they were still facing pockets of resistance . For the second day running, RAF Tornado . GR4s attacked targets in and around the coastal town, 250 miles east of .

The Tornados took off from RAF Marham in Norfolk on a long-range strike . mission firing a salvo of Storm Shadow precision-guided missiles against . a large command and control bunker. It followed strikes by Tornados the previous day on three mobile missile . launchers for Scud missiles. Regime commanders are said to have kept . back an arsenal of 240 Scuds which would be capable of carrying chemical . weapons such as mustard gas. Rebels point to reports that more than 100 . of their captured fighters and supporters have been executed in Sirte . and this has fuelled their determination to storm it.

The importance of that military operation was illustrated by Nato . carrying out 29 strikes on mobile missile launchers around the town as . rebels blitzed advancing forces with volleys of Grad missiles. With Nato effectively ‘closing the ring’ around Sirte’s 100,000 . population, Defence Secretary Liam Fox said: ‘We have information that . there are some elements of the regime in Sirte. Where they are still . continuing to wage war on the people of Libya, we will continue to . degrade their military capabilities. ‘The regime needs to recognise that the game is up. It is all over and . they need to stop attacking their own people … but as long as they do . continue to attack the people, Nato will continue to attack.’ Yesterday rebel forces appeared to have been stalled by strong . resistance some 60 miles from Sirte while the defences of the town are . finalised under the direction of one of Gaddafi’s sons. The rebel . leadership, apparently trying to avoid repeating the bloodshed of the . battle for Tripoli, are working behind the scenes to secure the peaceful . surrender of Sirte but are said to believe this is a ‘distant hope’. Virtually untouched until recently by the civil war, Sirte is of both . symbolic and strategic importance – it stands on the main highway . between Tripoli and the rebel headquarters of Benghazi – and is . Gaddafi’s strongest remaining garrison town. Gaddafi ploughed huge sums . of money into Sirte, arming the local tribes and effectively buying . their loyalty months ago. Rebel fighters would face a difficult task to . take it without massive help from Nato airstrikes. Gaddafi has closely cultivated Sirte and its tribal leaders. After .

"A thief who avoided jail by faking a pregnancy has finally been locked up after her lies unravelled. Lisa Philips, 37, told police she was 13 weeks pregnant when she was arrested for stealing £14,700 from her aunt and spending it on beauty treatments and a PlayStation. By the time she had her day in court, the total was seven months - so a judge took pity on her and suspended  jail  as she rubbed her 'bump'. Now you see it... Thief Lisa Philips, 37, has finally been locked up after faking a pregnancy to avoid jail. She is pictured left after her  hearing for stealing from her aunt last year - where she held her 'bump' - and right today . Philips originally received a four-month sentence suspended for two years last October for stealing £14,700 from her aunt Tracy Sedgewick. A court heard the resident of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham - who has a 16-year-old son - was concerned her aunt's partner Ahmet Oktar, 41, was going to take the money out of the country. But instead of putting away the money for safekeeping she bought a large TV and PlayStation as well as beauty treatments and designer goods. When police investigated she showed them a false NatWest bank statement she had created, and later pleaded guilty. Conwoman: The court heard Philips made up a lie in the heat of the moment and stuck to it resolutely . But when she was first arrested in June she told the custody sergeant she was 13 weeks pregnant - an elaborate lie she maintained for months, Teesside Crown Court heard today. She was even photographed holding her 'bump' as she left court, prosecutor Paul Cleasby said. Probation officers became suspicious after her due date had passed and there was no baby to be found. She showed them pictures of a child she claimed to be her baby, and said the child was staying with a relative, before eventually claiming she had lost the pregnancy. When she was challenged about what had really happened she finally agreed she had lied to police. The prosecutor said: 'She claimed she had panicked, she had not set out to improve her situation. Once the lie had been told she simply could not retract. 'The probation team were suspicious but gave her the benefit of the doubt. 'They would ask her about the progress of the pregnancy and the defendant continued to lie.' Philips pleaded guilty to one count of perverting the course of justice. Ben Pegman, defending, said: 'She is genuinely sorry, embarrassed and ashamed for her actions. 'What started as a lie given in expediency when she was first arrested by the police has spiralled into something extremely serious. 'She recognises she had opportunities throughout the proceedings to correct the lie she gave to police.' Judge Peter Armstrong, who  handed down the original suspended sentence for theft, said this time an immediate jail term was required. He said her fake pregnancy had been taken into account when he decided to spare her jail last year - despite him feeling  a custodial sentence was 'richly deserved'. 'You avoided jail because of your bogus mitigation,' he told her. 'It would be wholly unjust, not just to Tracy Sedgewick but to the public, if that was to happen again. A judge at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) said it would be 'wholly unjust' to allow Philips' lies to win the day . 'You conned your aunt and then during the course of mitigation you said you were expecting a child only months away so the court took that into account and suspended the sentence. 'This was an lie made out of panic and an attempt to protect your son seeing you being taken away in handcuffs.' But Philips' victim Tracy Sedgewick, 46,  hit out at today's sentence branding it 'disgusting'. 'Lisa will be out in a few months,' she said. 'What I really wanted was for her to be ordered by the court to pay the money back. I have been in debt because of Lisa since 2011. 'Me and my partner Ahmet have managed to pay most of it back, but the whole thing has had an horrific impact on our lives. We have been scrimping and scraping to get by.'","Lisa Philips, 37, from County Durham, admitted taking £14,700 from  aunt .

When Averill asks the man for the name of his supervisor, he calls her a ‘f****** retard.’ Scroll down for video . Chris Bernier, the manager at a Domino’s Pizza joint in Saginaw, Michigan, has been fired after repeatedly swearing at a customer  in an argument over a wrong order . Brandi Averill, right, confront the manager at the restaurant in Saginaw after he allegedly put the phone down on her and her son over an incorrect order. Her daughter, left, film the incident on her phone . ‘My supervisors name is “go f*** yourself,”’ get the f*** outta here!’ says the manager in a shockingly bad example of customer service. According to Averill, the incident started after her son complained about receiving a pizza with ‘light sauce’ instead of the ‘white sauce’ they had ordered. ‘The guy hung up on (my son),’ she told WNEM. When the manager hung up on her too, she showed up in person, along with her daughter who recorded the incident on her cell phone. The manager, who has been identified as Chris Bernier, is immediately rude to the customer. Bernier, who has been fired, has said that he regrets the incident but also that the footage doesn't show everything that happened to provoke his abuse . The store's owner has said that he feels embarrassed by Bernier's behavior and Domino's Corporation have also released a statement to distance themselves from the outburst . 'Did you come here to get your money back because I really don’t care much for your opinion,’ he tells her. When Averill persistently asks for his supervisor's name, he unleashed his verbal tirade although the customer isn't shy about giving as good as she gets. 'Excuse me, I’m not the one in a pizza outfit when I’m 40 years old so don’t be calling me a retard,' she yelled at Bernier. As the incident came to light via social media, Bernier has been fired from his job as the store's general manager. 'I regret the language I used, but if people could see everything that happened, especially in the phone calls, they would not be sympathetic for this woman,' he told WNEM. Averill has also admitted that she wasn't completely innocent, but says the treatment she received was still uncalled for. 'I didn't go about any of this to get him fired. I just wanted his supervisor to know that you need to talk to customers nicely,' she said. The store's owner Rob Asmar has said he feels embarrassed by the incident and Domino's Corporation have released a statement to distance themselves from Bernier's behavior. 'The comments made by this person do not reflect those of Domino's Pizza. We apologize for how poorly this reflects on our local stores and we assure you corrective action will be taken as the franchise owner determines,' read the statement.","Chris Bernier has been fired as the manager at a Domino’s Pizza joint in Saginaw, Michigan, after he repeatedly swore at a customer .

"An Ohio man who raped and killed his nine-year-old neighbor was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison without parole. Jerrod Metsker pleaded guilty to murdering Reann Murphy, whose body was found dumped in a trash can at the trailer park where they both lived. The nine-year-old had last been seen building a snowman with Metsker, just hours before she disappeared on December 14 last year. Plea deal: Jerrod Metsker has been sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to raping and murdering his nine-year-old neighbor . Victim: Reann Murphy's body was found buried under trash one day after she had been seen building a snowman with Metsker .

Under the deal Metsker, who was described in court as a family friend, pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and rape. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. The county sheriff's office had said early in its investigation that Metsker had a 'diminished mental capacity' but declined to reveal further details of his condition.

"A millionaire property developer who pulled down a historic  greenhouse without planning permission to make way for luxury homes has been ordered to rebuild it brick by brick. Richard Rosebourne, 32, was granted permission to convert 19th century Heron Lodge in Worcester into four flats in November 2012, but on the strict condition that its greenhouse must be repaired and restored to its former glory. However, after developers discovered asbestos underneath the structure, which served as an orangery during the 1800s, they dismantled it. Destroyed: A millionaire property developer who pulled down this historic  greenhouse without planning permission to make way for luxury homes has been ordered to rebuild it brick by brick . Remains: The orangery was torn down after developers discovered asbestos underneath the structure . Mr Rosebourne, who is the development manager at Heron Homes Ltd, then submitted a retrospective planning application to demolish the greenhouse - which was rejected by Worcester City Council in September this year. Council chiefs have now ordered Mr Rosebourne to rebuild the entire structure piece by piece and have threatened court action if it is not done to a high enough quality. 'We are in the process of ensuring an historically accurate replacement is put in its place,' said Paul O’Connor, head of planning at Worcester City Council. 'If that doesn’t happen we will prosecute. 'But this is a high-profile enforcement case for us and we are working with the developer on it.' Scheme: Richard Rosebourne, 32, was granted permission to convert 19th century Heron Lodge (pictured) into four luxury homes in November 2012, but under the strict condition that its greenhouse must be repaired . Famous residents: The lodge was also home to the family of one of businessman William Kilbourne Kay, who founded mail-order catalogue company Kay's of Worcester . History: Heron Lodge was built as one of a group of villas to the east of Worcester city centre for Rear Admiral Herbert Brace Powell - who served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars . Grade Two listed Heron Lodge dates back to 1823, 14 years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, and it is believed the orangery was built around the same time. Despite not being covered by the listed status, the greenhouse was thought to be one of the last remaining buildings of its kind. It is believed it will cost  Mr Rosebourne more than £20,000 to repair the greenhouse. Today, Phil Douce, vice-chairman of Worcester Civic Society, criticised the developers for pulling down the building without permission. 'We are very, very worried about what’s gone on and want answers,' he said. 'The city council should be putting a stop to the work. Considerable damage has been done and it’s just not acceptable. Praised: Mr Rosebourne's application to pull down the greenhouse retrospectively was turned down after English Heritage called the glass building a 'status symbol' Worry: Phil Douce, vice-chairman of Worcester Civic Society, criticised the developers for pulling down the building without permission, and said he was 'very worried' by its destruction . 'I would estimate the cost of rebuilding it will be at least £20,000.' Jabba Riaz, who represents the area on Worcester City Council, added: 'Nationally, this was one of the last greenhouses of its age in the country. 'At the time it was built it was revolutionary.” Developer Mr Rosebourne made the retrospective bid to demolish the greenhouse in July this year. But it was rejected by Worcester City Council in September after English Heritage called the glass building a 'status symbol'. Mr Rosebourne said the decision now threatens to make his venture a loss-making one after he poured huge sums of money into the project . The property developer has now appointed a greenhouse expert who is currently doing work for the royal family to rebuild it. Heritage: Grade Two listed Heron Lodge dates back to 1823, 14 years before Queen Victoria came to the throne, and it is believed the orangery was built around the same time . Surviving: Despite not being covered by the house's listed status, the greenhouse was thought to be one of the last remaining buildings of its kind . Plans: Council chiefs have now ordered Mr Rosebourne to rebuild the entire structure piece by piece and have threatened court action if it is not done to a high enough quality . 'The greenhouse was falling down, it was rotting and in a terrible state,' he said. 'It was taken down and put to one side, yes, but it wasn’t demolished. It was practically falling apart. 'It’s costing us a fortune but we are putting in plans for a new one.' Mr Rosebourne said there was 'nothing special' about the greenhouse, and said rebuilding the orangery would end up leaving the project in debt. 'The council knew the greenhouse was always going to fall down and a new one was going to be put up,' he said. 'It's a Victorian off-the-shelf greenhouse. There's nothing special about it. 'We are going to have to put another greenhouse there, we are going to have get one made bespoke. 'It's a massive lump of work and a huge percentage of money that has to be ploughed into that. 'That will be the main issue that puts the project in debt. Bill: It is believed it will cost Mr Rosebourne more than £20,000 to repair the greenhouse . 'We have restored the house beautifully and they haven't congratulated us on that at all.' Mr Rosebourne said the company had already been forced to spend extra money on the main house after discovering dry and wet rot in the wooden beams. The new homes are due to be completed by the end of January and will cost between £300,000 and £700,000. Heron Lodge was built as one of a group of villas to the east of Worcester city centre for Rear Admiral Herbert Brace Powell - who served in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars - and named after his ship, HMS Heron. At the time, orangeries were the forerunners for modern conservatories and were often used by rich people to grow exotic fruits. James Hughes, conservation advisor at the Victorian Society  said pulling down the greenhouse was an 'unlawful destruction'. He added: 'We welcome Worcester City Council's decision to refuse retrospective planning permission for the demolition of Heron Lodge's glasshouse, which is an important element of the site's historic fabric. Put aside: Mr Rosebourne said the building was 'taken down and put to one side', but had not been 'demolished' 'In November 2012 the council granted consent for the conversion of Heron Lodge into four homes subject to a number of conditions, one of which required the glasshouse to be completely repaired before first occupation. 'Clearly this condition was never satisfied and we urge the council to enforce the rebuilding of the glasshouse following its unlawful destruction.' The lodge  was also home to the family of one of the most important people in Worcester, businessman William Kilbourne Kay, in the early 1900s. The entrepreneur formed his own mail-order catalogue company called Kay's of Worcester in 1889 and their factory dominated the city skyline. William Kilbourne Kay lived at Heron Lodge in the early 19th century and died in May 1929 after a long battle with cancer. Kay's is now part of KandCo.com which is owned by Shop Direct Group - a multi-brand online retailer in the UK which merged with the Littlewoods home shopping business in 2005. Anger: James Hughes, conservation advisor at the Victorian Society said pulling down the greenhouse was an 'unlawful destruction' State: Mr Rosebourne said that the greenhouse had been rotting and was in a 'terrible state' Exclusive: Orangeries were the forerunners for modern conservatories and were often used by rich people to grow exotic fruits not otherwise suited to the British climate .","Richard Rosebourne had permission to turn 19th century lodge into flats .

"A new Gallup poll shows that the majority of Americans don't want President Barack Obama calling all the shots anymore. Americans say by a large margin that they'd rather Obama back off and let Republicans take the lead in the new Congress than the other way around. The poll supports Republican claims that last week's midterm elections were in fact a referendum on the president - an assessment the White House has forcibly denied both before and after the president's party was walloped at the ballot box. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, pictured in Beijing, China earlier today, is vowing to forge ahead with his plans on immigration and other items on his policy agenda, despite last week's election results . Even before last week's midterm elections the White House had been spinning expected Democratic loses as mostly unrelated to Obama, saying individual candidates, not the nation's leader, were on the ballot this year. After his party's candidates were demolished in the off-year elections and exit polls showed that a third of voters came out to send the president a message of opposition - compared to just 19 percent who said they were voting that day to support Obama - the president still vowed to forge ahead with his agenda, regardless of anyone else's opinion on the matter. 'My job over the next couple of years is to do some practical, concrete things as much as possible with Congress,' Obama said during a post-election press conference last Wednesday. 'Where it’s not possible with Congress,' he said, I'll do it 'on my own, to show people why we should be confident and to give people a sense of progress and a sense of hope.' But just 36 percent of respondents to Gallup's latest survey said they wanted Obama to set the agenda moving forward. More than half, 53 percent, said they thought Republicans' plans should be given more weight than the presidents. The poll, taken after the election from Nov. 6-9, indicates that voters did indeed mean the midterm elections to be a realignment of leadership and priorities. If warnings in the weeks before midterms as well as the elections themselves weren't enough to convince the White House to change tack, it's unlikely that a new polling will change the president's calculus, either, however. At his presser last week President Obama indicated that he would make no policy shifts nor would he significantly change his approach to working with Republicans on Capitol Hill despite the previous evening's loses. Obama said he's always tried to seek out compromise with Republicans whenever he can, and he intends to keep doing that. Pressed to name a change he would make 'to address the concerns that voters expressed' with him and his administration, Obama said that as the 'guy who’s elected by everybody' and not just voters from a certain state or congressional district, Americans 'want me to push hard to close some of these divisions, break through some of the gridlock, and get stuff done. 'So, the most important thing I can do is just get stuff done and help Congress get some things done,' he said, suggesting that he would work harder to force Republicans' hands than he did before his party was publicly reprimanded by voters. Americans clearly want Obama to follow Republicans' lead and not the other way around, a Gallup poll released this afternoon shows . He also committed to going around newly elected Republican officials to make changes to the country's immigration rules, arguing that he's already given GOP lawmakers who are currently serving in federal office an opportunity to stop him by passing comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Now it's his turn at the wheel, he said. 'I think it’s fair to say that I have shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible,' he contended. 'And I’m going to keep on doing so. But in the meantime, let’s figure out what we can do lawfully though executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system.' Days later, President Obama was still refusing to give an inch to Republicans when he sat down with CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer for a special edition of its hit Sunday morning program Face the Nation. Again asked what he plans to do differently in light of the recent election results, Obama said he told his team it needs to do a better job convincing Republicans to get on board with the White House's plans. 'We've got to sell it, we've got to reach out to the other side and where possible persuade,' he said. 'And I think there are times, there's no doubt about it where, you know, I think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we are trying to do and why this is the right direction,' he said, chalking up Democratic loses to 'a failure of politics.' The only valid criticism of his administration that Obama was willing to admit to Schieffer was giving up too quickly on fighting a 'pretty stubborn' opposition. Likewise, at a briefing on Thursday with reporters White House flak Josh Earnest blamed election loses on Republican obstructionism. 'They may be able to say with some credibility that they did benefit politically from obstructing the President’s agenda at every turn. I don't think the country benefited from that, though,' Earnest told reporters. 'And I don't just say that because Republicans are now in the majority. 'I just think that there was a lot of very important things that didn't get done that could have, had the President found more willing partners among Republicans,' he opined. Earnest said he doesn't expect Republicans to completely reecalibrate once they officially take over Congress in January, but he does hope they will be more open to Democratic-backed legislation. 'Again, it doesn’t mean that there are going to be daily renditions of Kumbaya sung on Pennsylvania Avenue, but I do think that we can be at least a little more optimistic that where common ground exists, that Democrats and Republicans can move together on it,' he said. If voters expected Obama to step aside during the final two years of his presidency and let the GOP-led Congress chart the nation a new course, they would appear to be woefully mistaken based on Obama's behavior in the last week. Obama told reporters last Wednesday that he planned 'to squeeze every last little bit of opportunity' out of his presidency to shape the nation. 'The one thing I’m pretty confident about...is, I’m going to be busy for the next two years,' he noted. 'And the one thing that I want the American people to be confident about is that every day, I’m going to be filling up my time trying to figure out how I can make their lives better. 'And if I’m doing that, at the end of my presidency, I’ll say, “We played that fourth quarter well, and we played the game well.” And the only difference between, I guess, basketball and ... politics is that the only score that matters is how’d somebody else do, not how you did. And that’s the score I’m keeping.'","Americans say by a large margin that want Obama to back off and let Republicans take the lead in the new Congress .
But Obama still plans to act alone on immigration and other policies Republicans won't get on board with .
'Where it’s not possible with Congress,' Obama said last Wednesday, I'll do it 'on my own, to show people why we should be confident'"

"Protesters were arrested after refusing to leave corporate property outside McDonald's headquarters on Wednesday, as hundreds demonstrated to call attention to the low pay earned by fast-food workers. The actions come ahead of the company's annual shareholders meeting Thursday, where it is also expected to be confronted on issues including its executive pay packages and marketing to children. Early Wednesday, organizers changed the location of their demonstration after learning McDonald's closed the building where they had planned their actions and told employees there to work from home. The corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, has several buildings on a sprawling campus. Scroll down for video .

Organizers said about 100 McDonald's workers who traveled from around the country were arrested, along with community leaders and supporters. Among them was Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, who said in a statement released after her arrest that she wanted McDonald's workers to know her union members stood with them. The SEIU has been providing financial and organizational support to the fast-food protests, which began in late 2012 in New York City and have been spreading to other cities and countries. Angry: The protesters are said to be employees from several fast food restaurants, not just McDonald's . Arrests: The protesters say police arrested about 100 demonstrators who refused to leave the property . While turnout for the protests has varied, they've nevertheless struck a chord at a time when the gap between the country's rich and poor has widened. Executive pay packages are coming under greater scrutiny too, and shareholders last week rebuked Chipotle Mexican Grill's compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million for its co-CEOs in a non-binding, advisory vote. McDonald's Corp., which is far bigger than Chipotle, gave CEO Don Thompson a pay package worth $9.5 million last year. Outside its headquarters, 25-year-old McDonald's worker Jessica Davis said she wasn't worried about being arrested. 'I'm worried about not being able to pay my bills,' said Davis, who earns about $9 an hour at a Chicago restaurant. She said she supports two young children and relies on public assistance and help from her family to get by. A spokesman for the Oak Brook police department, George Peterson, said the arrested protesters were being processed and would be released, with court dates being assigned later. He estimated the crowd of demonstrators at up to 1,500. Clash: The demonstrators clashed with police on several occasions during the protests . Shareholders: The protests were held in coordination with McDonald's annul shareholders meeting . Pay gap: McDonald's CEO Don Thompson was given a pay package worth $9.5 million last year . Although some municipalities have higher rates, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and translates to about $15,000 a year for a person who works 40 hours a week. But most fast-food workers are given far less time on the clock, in part because restaurant owners want to avoid paying overtime and limit the number of employees who receive benefits, if they are offered. Protesters also plan to demonstrate outside the company's annual meeting Thursday morning. Shareholder meetings offer the public a rare chance to confront top executives at major publicly traded companies. While ordinary investors typically don't attend, the meetings are frequented by public pension funds, activist groups and religious organizations seeking to change corporate practices. Although other fast-food chains such as Burger King and Taco Bell use many of the same practices, McDonald's is a frequent target for critics because of its size and high profile. In a statement, the company said it respects 'everyone's right to peacefully protest.' Later, spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem called the protest 'very much a staged event.'","Hundreds of fast-food workers from across the country descended upon McDonald's corporate headquarters in Illinois on Wednesday .
At least 100 demonstrators were arrested during the protests, according to the protesters .
The workers are demanding a $15 minimum wage for fast-food workers, as well as better working conditions .

"England and Northampton have been boosted by the news that Alex Corbisiero is set to return to Aviva Premiership action before the New Year. The 26-year-old Lions prop had surgery to repair damaged ligaments after dislocating his shoulder playing against Bath in September and missed England’s autumn campaign. That followed an intensely frustrating previous season which saw him need surgery on both knees. Corbisiero has played a full role in training in recent days and Saints coach Jim Mallinder even considered starting him in the derby clash with Leicester at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday. England and Lions prop Alex Corbisiero has played a full part in training for Northampton this week . The 26-year-old loosehead has been out of action since he dislocated his shoulder against Bath in September . But a specialist has recommended an extra week on the sidelines meaning that, bar any last-minute setbacks, the 19-cap prop will start against Harlequins at Twickenham on December 27. ‘Alex is training well and is ready to go,’ a Saints insider said on Wednesday. ‘He could have played this weekend but medical advice says he should be given the full 12 weeks to recover from the surgery.’ Corbisiero’s pending return is excellent news for Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team following a difficult autumn spell which saw England’s squad severely depleted by injury. Wasps and England lock Joe Launchbury saw a specialist on Wednesday following a slower-than-expected recovery from a neck injury which continues to threaten his Six Nations participation. Corbisiero starred for the Lions in their series victory over Australia in 2013 and scored a try in the third Test . But Premiership champions Saints are in rude health. Centre Luther Burrell is also set to start against Leicester after fully recovering from a broken bone in his hand which has seen him eased back into action in recently weeks. Saints yesterday confirmed that seven players, including England hooker Dylan Hartley and lock Courtney Lawes, have signed contract extensions. Hartley, 28, had been considering a move to French Top 14 outfit Montpellier but turned down a big-money move, as exclusively revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday, in order to stay at a club he has served for almost a decade. Corbisiero's return is a welcome boost for England as Joe Launchbury is expected to miss the Six Nations . RFU rules make overseas-based players ineligible for England selection and while Hartley’s proposed deal to move to France would have begun after next year’s World Cup, the 61-cap hooker admits the threat of international exile was the biggest factor in his decision to stay. ‘It wasn’t a straightforward decision,’ he said. ‘I’m in my 10th season at Saints and I had to seriously consider the pros and cons. I thought it might be time for a new challenge. ‘I’ve been here for a long time and also that new challenge would have meant a significant pay rise. But when I weighed it up, the ultimate for me is playing for England and if I went, I wouldn’t be able to do that. ‘If I had gone, I still would have been eligible for the World Cup, but after that I’d have drawn a line under playing for England. That was one of the biggest blocks to stop me from going.’ l Harlequins on Wednesday night confirmed Sportsmail’s story from October that Australia lock James Horwill, 29, will join them after the World Cup. Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea said: ‘James is known around the world not only for his uncompromising style of play but also for his strength of character. He will be an asset for us on the field and within the changing room.’ Horwill has won 58 caps. Harlequins have confirmed that Wallabies lock James Horwill (centre) will join the club after the World Cup .","Alex Corbisiero had surgery to repair damaged ligaments in September .

"Abandoned: Lee Doran, 17, was left alone in Portugal after fighting with his stepfather on a plane . A teenager was abandoned in Portugal after a fight with his stepfather forced a plane to make an emergency landing. Lee Doran, 17, was on his first trip abroad with half-brother Dylan, 14, stepfather David Laughton, 39, his partner Sarah Wilson, 28, and their son Harry, three, when he and David had a fierce row at 35,000ft. The stepfather claims the incident has been 'blown up out of proportion'. During the flight to the Spanish island Lanzarote, Mr Laughton and his stepson got into such a heated row that the pilot was forced to land in Portugal and ordered them off the plane. Holidaymakers were forced to wait as the . quarrelling family were marched off the plane by waiting police . officers at Porto airport. Members of the family were questioned but eventually released without charge. They then left seventeen-year-old stepson Lee alone in Porto as they caught another flight to their holiday destination. Mr Laughton was contacted at his hotel . in Lanzarote where he revealed he eventually made his way to the . destination via Madrid with his family following the row, at a cost of . £1,500. He downplayed the incident which is believed to have cost the plane's carrier, Thomson, an estimated £35,000. He told the Daily Mirror: 'We were 50 minutes from landing and Lee pulled his hood up and I pulled it down. Family fight on board: A pilot was forced to land a plane at Porto airport in Portugal, pictured, after a fierce row erupted between a family-of-five . 'The next thing I knew, he had his arms around my neck and we ended up in the aisle. 'When we got to Porto he wouldn't take any money from me. Lee is 17 and lives on his own in London. This has been blown out of all proportion.' But he apologised to his fellow airline passengers for the disruption his row with his stepson caused. He added: 'I understand this caused a great deal of upset, but we would not continue on the trip as was planned. 'I am sorry that the plane was diverted and I can understand why that action was taken.' The family were heading to Lanzarote . for a two week all-inclusive break costing £1,500 when the argument . broke out on the flight from Newcastle on September 13. Diverting the plane was a last resort, a spokesman for the airline said. The family were on their way to Lanzarote, pictured, for a two week holiday. They eventually arrived there but left stepson Lee Doram, 17, alone in Porto . He said: ‘We would like to apologise to passengers for any disruption encountered during the flight. ‘Unfortunately a party of passengers became disruptive on board and as a last resort the flight had to be diverted to Portugal. ‘Upon landing, the aircraft was met by local police and the passengers were removed from the flight for further questioning. ‘Thomson operates a zero tolerance policy with regards to any disruptive behaviour on board and incidents of this type are extremely rare.’ The couple, from Hartlepool, Cleveland, have been banned from the return flight and will have to make their own arrangements to get home. Jannine Bird, Lee’s mother, who is . also mother to 14-year-old Dylan, was horrified to discover that Lee had . been left alone at the airport. 'Appalling': Lee's mother was horrified that her teenage son was left alone in a foreign country before he was flown home with the help of the British embassy . Ms . Bird, who split with Mr Laughton a decade ago after an eight-year . relationship, said: ‘To leave Lee all by himself in a foreign country is . just appalling.’ She made . desperate arrangements with the Foreign Office and the British Embassy . in Portugal to bring Lee home safely after he spent 24 hours waiting . outside the police station and the airport. British embassy staff arranged for him to be flown home in London, where he lives with Ms Bird with the 14-year-old child in Islington. The flight cost Ms Bird £200. Ms Bird, who works for an asbestos removal firm and lives in Islington, London with her two sons, said that Mr Laughton was seeing the boys during the summer. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the incident and we have provided consulate assistance but we don’t comment on cases involving minors.’","The family's argument was so heated that the airline diverted the plane to Portugal as a 'last resort'

"Travelling Chelsea fans won't find it too hard to pick out their heroes in action next season. Jose Mourinho's side have released their new away kit, an all-yellow tribute to the west London club's history.

Close-up: The kit features the Chelsea crest and adidas logo in the west London club's classic royal blue . Throwback: The kit will be seen by the club's fans as return to their more traditional change colour . Stamford Bridge legends like Peter Osgood and Charlie Cooke frequently donned yellow on the fabled FA Cup winning-side of 1970s travels. The colour also cropped up on the 1980s pinstriped kits of Pat Nevin and Kerry Dixon, while younger fans will remember 1990s stars like Gianfranco Zola and Dennis Wise in yellow kits. The move back to yellow will be popular with the club's fanbase, in the last decade only treated to the colour in the kit worn in the 2009 cup final and a controversial flourescent kit in 2007. The kit should also make Chelsea's host of Brazilian stars feel right at home. Midfielders Oscar, Willian and Ramires, as well as David Luiz - all in Luis Felipe Scolari's World Cup squad - give the Stamford Bridge squad a decidedly 'samba' feel.

"Former England full back Delon Armitage has been handed a three-month ban for verbally abusing Leicester fans during Toulon's European Cup defeat at Welford Road 11 days ago. Armitage, a serial offender who has received a previous ban for abusing a doping official and has a catalogue of on-field misconduct charges, contested the charge but was found guilty by a three man disciplinary panel. The panel found inconsistencies in his evidence. Toulon full-back Delon Armitage has been suspended for 12 weeks following a misconduct complaint . The incident occurred duing Toulon's 25-21 loss to Leicester at Welford Road 11 days ago . He would have only received an eight week ban if he had a clean record but the former London Irish star found his poor disciplinary record counted against him. 'The misconduct complaint against Armitage was that during and after the match he was alleged to have conducted himself in an unsportsmanlike manner by making a number of comments to, or within earshot of, spectators using foul and abusive language and may have brought into disrepute the sport of rugby union, the European Rugby Champions Cup, other clubs and persons and/or EPCR in contravention of the Disciplinary Rules of the European Rugby Champions Cup Participation Agreement 2014/15,' A statement read. 'After considering evidence and hearing submissions on behalf of Armitage, who pleaded not guilty, and on behalf of the EPCR Disciplinary Officer, the independent Disciplinary Committee was not satisfied that a comment allegedly made by Armitage during the match had been made as the inconsistencies in the evidence were too great. Armitage (centre) and Mamuka Gorgodze (right) of Toulon are tackled by Jamie Gibson of Leicester . 'However, the Committee was satisfied that Armitage had directed abusive language at Leicester Tigers supporters after the match, and while it found that his comments were provoked, the Committee decided he was guilty of misconduct. 'The Committee determined that the sanction entry point should be eight weeks, and as this was Armitage's second post-match misconduct case in the last four years, and as there were no mitigating factors, it decided to add four weeks to the ban before imposing a suspension of 12 weeks. Armitage was also ordered to pay costs.'

"A sheriff's deputy who beat up his father after he caught him having sex with his wife appeared before a police disciplinary hearing on Wednesday and received a four-year suspension from the force. Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, of Moab, Utah, assaulted his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, a respected local fire chief, after he allegedly found him having sex with his wife Logan in their son's bed last July. Later that day, Brewer also hit an officer who was trying to keep him from going to the hospital where his father was being treated. Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, 33, of Moab, Utah, appeared before a police disciplinary hearing on Wednesday and received a four-year suspension from the force after he assaulted his father and another officer last July . On Wednesday he appeared before the Utah Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Council and begged them to let him keep his badge. ‘I regret it every day since this incident happened, when I walked upstairs and saw what I saw,’ said an apologetic Brewer. ‘This is the second-worst day of my life.’ In the criminal case, Brewer had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor counts of assault and assault against a police officer and was sentenced to 24 months probation. Brewer managed to keep his certification on Wednesday, but only by a single vote. Betrayal: Timothy John 'TJ' Brewer, right, beat his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer (pictured together) after he caught him in bed with his wife Logan . Brewer appeared before the Utah Peace Officer Standards and Training Council on Wednesday and begged them to let him keep his badge . Instead of revoking his it, as had been recommended, the POST Council voted 6-5 to suspend Brewer for four years . Following the suspension, he will have to go back through the police academy if he wants to wear a badge again. 'There’s no doubt in my mind that his actions at the house that day were justified. I believe that practically anybody would have done similarly at the house,' said Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds, a member of the POST Council. 'Where Mr. Brewer loses me is when he goes back to the hospital.' Brewer had asked for the opportunity to work in law enforcement again, asking that he be given a suspension instead of revocation. Happier times: TJ Brewer allegedly found his wife Logan Brewer having sex with his father in their son's bed . He assaulted his father Wesley 'Corky' Brewer, a respected local fire chief, after he found him having sex . with his wife Logan in their son's bed. The assaults happened on July 11 when Brewer invited his father over for dinner. According to police reports,  Brewer cooked dinner for the trio before his wife went to put one of their children to bed. After she did not return, he went upstairs to check and allegedly found her 'on top of his dad' on their son's bed. Brewer then fought with his father and his wife raced to her parents' house. Wesley Brewer then returned to his own home 'to find a firearm'. However when his . distressed wife, Cindy Brewer, tried to hide the gun in the car, Wesley Brewer allegedly 'grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed himself two . times, puncturing a lung and slicing his liver'. Family: TJ Brewer, pictured with his wife Logan and their children, managed to keep his certification on Wednesday, but only by a single vote . He was rushed to Moab Regional Hospital and eventually had to be flown to a Colorado hospital for surgery. The father and son were among several law enforcement officers in the extended Brewer . family, which includes multiple police officers and local sheriff’s . deputies. TPM reported that TJ then went to the hospital to 'kill' his father, and was initially confronted by his uncle, Curt Brewer, who is also a sheriff’s . deputy, in the parking lot. When police arrived, an intoxicated TJ wasn't wearing a shirt or shoes and 'stated several . times that he wanted to kill his dad, that he wanted his gun to ‘finish . the job'.' Police wrote in their report: 'TJ . made numerous remarks to each officer and deputy that arrived, about . all of us being stupid, dumb asses, and at one point stated that we needed to . call someone with a brain to come and talk with him.' Injured: Moab Fire Chief Wesley 'Corky' Brewer stabbed himself twice after the confrontation . He then assaulted a police officer, before he was arrested and charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault, two . counts of domestic violence in front a child, assault on a police . officer, intoxication, and disorderly conduct by Grand County officers. Due to the Brewers' law enforcement ties in Grand County, the investigation was passed onto the Utah County Sheriff’s Office who reduced the charges to two class A misdemeanors - assault and assault against a . peace officer. The Utah Attorney General prosecuted the case rather than the local . district attorney. Since his arrest, Brewer has resigned as sheriff's deputy at the Grand County Sheriff’s Department. His father also resigned from the fire department where he had been . chief since 1989.

"They were separated just before the Second World War. And in the 75 years since, Rose Burleigh had caught just one fleeting glimpse of her younger brother John Stubbs – without even realising it was him. But now brother and sister have been reunited after an amateur genealogist managed to fill in a gap in their family tree. Details of their separation are sparse, lost in the mists of the distant past. Siblings John Stubbs and Rose Burleigh have been reunited after 75 years apart thanks to detective work by her friend . Rose and John say this the last photograph of the two of them together before they were separated, at home with their mother Gladys in 1938 . John and Rose were brought up separately during the Second World War - but their father couldn't get Rose back from her adoptive family when it ended . A young John Stubbs is pictured at their mother's grave. She died in 1941 before her husband had returned home from the war . What is known is that Mrs Burleigh, . 77, was adopted by an aunt on the Isle of Wight in 1938 and her surname . was changed, while Mr Stubbs was looked after by their grandparents in . Chichester, West Sussex. Their mother Gladys died in 1941, aged 30, while their soldier father Charles, a driver and officers’ batman, was away at war. He was captured but escaped, only to be recaptured and sent back to a prisoner of war camp in Germany. He was not released until the end of the war. Returning home, he went to reclaim his daughter but was turned away. Mrs Burleigh had given up hope of seeing her brother again, until her friend Roger Mitchell managed to trace him. ‘When Roger phoned to tell me he had . found my brother and had spoken to him I was overwhelmed,’ said Mrs . Burleigh, a retired care worker from Exeter. ‘I went into complete shock. I was so . glad he was alive and well. When I rang him I didn’t have any nerves at . all. I felt really comfortable chatting with him. ‘Being brother and sister, there was an instant natural connection. It was really emotional and there were a lot of tears.’ Now the brother and sister are catching up on their respective family histories and poring over old photographs . John Stubbs, aged eight, pictured with his grandmother Marjorie Stubbs, left, who brought him up, and other unidentified friends and family . Their father Charles brought John up and died in 1984 . The pair arranged to meet in . Southampton. Mr Stubbs, a retired highways officer from Chichester, . said: ‘As soon as I saw her I thought, “Yes, that’s my sister”. I had . been looking for her for 50 years. ‘I didn’t know her adoptive parents . changed her name from Stubbs to Kelly which obviously made it tricky. So . when I got the phone call from Rose we both cried and couldn’t really . say much. 'We phoned each other again the next . day and were able to talk more. We have been ringing each other since . and catching up on each other’s lives. 'We are just so lucky to have found . each other so late in life.’ They do not know why they were separated . but Mrs Burleigh remembers as a little girl an incident when a man with a . boy turned up at her aunt’s house. ‘I remember seeing a man in army . uniform coming to the house carrying someone,’ she said. ‘But when I . turned away they were gone. I have spoken to John about that day and he . said, “The man was our dad and the boy he was carrying was me”. ‘I wasn’t told that was my dad and brother.’ Mr Stubbs believes the adoptive parents refused to hand the young Rose back. She never saw her father again. Mr . Stubbs was brought up by his grandparents until he was 15. He then moved . back in with his father, who died in 1984, aged 70.

"These are the terrifying moments a climber loses his grip and plummets 100ft down the side of a Welsh mountain.

The footage, captured by his helmet camera and giving the viewer a glimpse of Roberts's point of view, shows him putting up his arm before his fall begins. Scroll down for video . A falling block of ice led to mountaineer Mark Roberts taking a terrifying plunge down a Welsh mountainside . It took thirty seconds for Roberts to be able to halt on a ledge . The fall happened so quickly that Mark Roberts lost control and could not 'self-arrest' For 30 seconds, Roberts is seen plunging from the Parsley Fern Gully at Cwm Glas. He hits rocks and flips over as he tumbles from his spot and loses his axes. After coming to a halt on a ledge, Roberts takes a few moments to catch his breath before - understandably - uttering: 'That f****** hurt.' Roberts was rescued by the Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team within half an hour of his fall on February 24 and came away with a twisted ankle and bruises after being airlifted by an RAF search and rescue team from 22 Squadron on Anglesey, the same team that Prince William serves on. He told the British Mountaineering Council's website that the steep slope meant he did not have enough time to 'self arrest' - to stop his fall himself - before starting to bounce. The British Mountaineering Council's Elfyn Jones, who was part of the rescue team, told The Next Web: 'I think the key message here is that accidents do happen, but that Mark was well equipped, wearing a helmet, and that probably saved his life.' Roberts was rescued by the Llanberis Mountain Rescue team within half an hour of the fall and was expected to make a full recovery .

"A Melbourne woman was left 'emotionally distraught' after being verbally and physically assaulted during a racial tirade by a fellow train passenger. The 26-year-old victim was standing by the doors of the train as it approached Batman Railway Station in Northern Melbourne on Thursday evening, when she was approached by another woman who began hurling abuse at her. Media reports allege the victim was a Muslim woman. Victorian police said the offender made a number of racial remarks before assaulting the woman.

'Muslim women are being addressed in the street and insulted about their garb, there are some threats being made to police, these are issues we need to see and understand... They're not huge numbers but even if there's one we need to get it, we need to understand it... Members of faith communities need to have the confidence to bring it to police.'

"France's . far-Right Front National (FN) has been convulsed by a family row after . founder Jean-Marie Le Pen accused his daughter of leading the party in a . politically correct direction. The . fall-out was sparked at the weekend when M Le Pen made a ‘joke’ in . which he appeared to suggest that a popular French Jewish singer, . Patrick Bruel, should be put into an oven. Marine . Le Pen accused him of making a ‘political mistake’, and said the . incident gave her the opportunity ‘to remind people that the FN condemns any form of anti-Semitism in the strongest terms’. Jean-Marie Le Pen was criticised by Jewish groups and prominent members of his own party over the weekend for the comment made in a video posted on the National Front's website on Friday . Her . father then hit back by attacking Mlle Le Pen, 45, for turning the . party into a more mainstream organisation since taking the reins in 2011 . – a policy that led to huge success in the recent European elections, . when the Front National took first place in France with 25 per cent of . the vote. ‘I . consider that the serious political error is made by those who align . themselves with political correctness,’ the 85-year-old said. ‘They want . to be like the other parties.’ M . Le Pen had said Bruel would be part of ‘a batch [of critics] we will . get next time’ – using the word fournée for batch, evoking the word four . which means oven in French. M Le Pen was re-elected as an MEP in the elections, but . this did not stop him making a pun referring to the Nazi gas chambers . during World War II. In a video posted on the FN website, and posted on YouTube, the 85-year-old attacks a number of the party's critics, including pop star Madonna. When asked about another - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel - M Le Pen said he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word 'oven'. Thousands of French Jews were sent to German concentration camps during the war, where most were murdered. A spokesman for SOS Racism, a leading . Paris civil rights group, described M Le Pen's pun as 'the worst kind . of anti-Semitic filth'. Marine Le Pen (pictured, right, in 2011) said her father (left) had made a 'political error' but that the 'meaning given to his comments is a malicious interpretation' He . said the group would file a legal complaint against M Le Pen, who . already has numerous convictions for racism and anti-Semitism, this . week. France's Movement . Against Racism and for Friendship Between Peoples, also said it would . lodge a complaint, calling M Le Pen 'an authentic anti-Semite'. M Le Pen handed over the reins of the FN to his daughter, Marine, in 2011, and she has pledged to soften its image. When asked about one of his party's critics - the Jewish singer Patrick Bruel (pictured) - Mr Le Pen said he would be part of a 'batch next time', while hinting at the word 'oven' Although M Le Pen retains significant influence, and Mlle Le Pen remains very loyal to him, other party members attacked him today. FN vice-president Louis Aliot, who lives with Mlle Le Pen, said it was 'a bad phrase' which was also 'politically stupid and disappointing'. Gilbert Collard, an FN-affiliated MP, said it was time for the party founder to 'accept [M Le Pen's] retirement'. Mlle Le Pen said the comment had been misinterpreted, but added that for an experienced politician like her father 'not to have foreseen how this phrase would be interpreted is a political mistake the Front National is [now] paying for.' Earlier M Le Pen had said: 'If there are people in my camp that have interpreted my comments in this way, they are nothing but imbeciles.' He denied being anti-Jewish, saying the words he used had 'no anti-Semitic connotation', except for 'political enemies or idiots'. He made it clear that the offending video had now been removed from the web. M Le Pen, who once described the Nazi gas chambers as a 'detail' of history, was runner up in the French presidential elections of 2002.","Jean-Marie Le Pen appeared to make comments referring to Nazi gas chambers .

"Every Sunday Reverend Martyn Pinnock offers communion to the congregation at his parish church in Cornwall. But the cash-strapped vicar was forced to take up delivering a different kind of bread - by becoming a Sainsbury's delivery driver. The 66-year-old combines work for the church with two days a week behind the wheel for the supermarket giants. Reverend Martyn Pinnock has taken a job as a Sainsbury's delivery driver because he is short of cash . He started working for Sainsbury’s five years ago but only regained his religious licence last November after marrying for the second time. Rev Pinnock took charge of the Parish of Tregony and St Cuby with Cornelly near Truro in Cornwall. The grandfather said: 'I’m doing both jobs because I need the money. 'The biggest problem is that having been made the vicar of the parish the church is paying me for half of the time but it’s impossible to be a parish priest for half of the time. Rev Pinnock works for Sainsbury's for 10 hours on Mondays and nine hours on Tuesdays each week . He took over as vicar in charge of the Parish of Tregony and St Cuby with Cornelly near Truro in Cornwall . 'People ring me up when I’m driving. I have to sit down after a day’s driving and then work out what I’m going to say in the pulpit.' Rev Pinnock works for Sainsbury’s for 10 hours on Mondays and nine hours on Tuesdays each week. He returned to the UK in 2008 after a three-year spell in the United States where he worked for electronic company Plessey. The vicar started working for Sainsbury's five years ago but regained his religious licence last year . At that stage he was still in the process of going through a divorce and was not allowed to hold a ministerial licence until he re-married. He said ‘hefty legal fees’ from his divorce were reasons he was short of money. 'It is difficult to juggle two jobs,' said the vicar. 'If you’re a priest and particularly a parish priest, you are considering issues about parish life and everything becomes a bit of a juggling exercise. 'I did reduce my hours at Sainsbury’s, although due to the ten hour and nine hour shift, I am still quite busy and I do cover a big area. 'I’m not sure how long I plan on being at Sainsbury’s - a lot depends on what happens in the church and whether my role in the diocese changes from part-time to full-time. 'However, the idea of not working never appeals to me, I will carry on driving for Sainsbury’s for as long as they let me.' He added: 'I’m thinking about the church all the time. I’m thinking about it but I don’t wear the collar when I’m driving. 'Church for me is about a style of life rather than banner-waving. It most certainly is about seven days a week and not just Sunday. 'I’ve always found that my instinct to be pastorally caring comes out. 'You get elderly folk who are trying to be independent and you try and do as much as you can for them. 'We certainly go to more trouble for people in need.'","The 66-year-old combines work for the church with delivering shopping .

"Eighty police failed to find Tia’s body even though it lay only a few feet from her bedroom in her grandmother’s house. They spent a week scouring hundreds of hours of CCTV and at least a dozen officers, with dogs, searched the house no fewer than four times. But astonishing blunders meant the 12-year-old’s body remained undiscovered at the small property in Croydon, South London. Blunders: A loft in a house neighbouring the one in which Tia was found on the fifth time the house was searched . By the time it was recovered, when the stench of decomposition was overwhelming, it was so badly damaged that she could only be identified by dental records. The blunder means vital evidence was lost and her family will never know the full circumstances of her death. Relatives said they are haunted by the thought that she was lying abandoned above them as the country was transfixed by the mystery of her disappearance. Speaking last night, Tia’s grandfather Paul Sharp, said: ‘I’m disgusted that the police officers didn’t find the body. Guilty: Stuart Hazell, 37, hid Tia's body in the attic of the home he shared with her grandmother . ‘They should have known she never left that house - people would have seen her.' He added: ‘The body was unrecognisable . when they found it. 'That’s how badly decomposed it was. They had to do a . dental check on her. ‘I don’t understand how they couldn’t smell it. 'The whole house must have stunk.’ Police only found Tia’s body tightly wrapped in plastic bin liners in the tiny loft space during a fifth search. Officers . complained they were hampered because they feared falling through the . unboarded ceiling and the space was hot and uncomfortable. Earlier . searches not only missed Tia, but a wealth of other evidence, including . her damaged glasses, because officers thought bags holding them were . ‘too light’ to be significant. They blamed police procedure as the officers were on a missing person inquiry and looking for someone who was alive. The first ‘brief examination’ of the house was undertaken by local officers on August 3, the day Tia was reported missing. The second, a more thorough check, was carried out the next day by two sergeants and two PCs. Among them was Sgt Keith Lyons who told . the jury that Hazell helped him, providing a chair and telling him - . chillingly - that he ‘always’ used it to access the loft. Sgt Lyons spent five minutes searching with his torch in the unlit loft. He said: ‘My legs were dangling down. ‘I know I’m clumsy and I was concerned I was going to go through the roof. ‘I was surprised how clear it was. I expected there to be much more junk. ‘I was searching for a missing girl and . from what I could see the loft seemed very clear. I thought ‘she is not . hiding in here.’ Hidden: Tia Sharp's body was found in the loft in her grandmother's home in Croydon, South London over a week after she was killed by Stuart Hazell . Fruitless search: Despite four searches by police officers using sniffer dogs, it was not until a specialist dog was taken in, that Tia's remains were founds . In the early hours of the following morning a specialist team, comprised of a sergeant and five PCs, carried out a third search. PC Steven Jeffries, one of the . officers involved, said: ‘I have never searched a loft before and I . didn’t want to cause any damage.’ The . officers spent 25 minutes searching, including moving black bags around . that the team believed did not contain anything significant. On a fourth search of the house on August 8 a specially trained dog also signalled towards the ceiling under the loft. Failings: Tia's body was so severely decomposed she had to be identified using dental records . But officers decided it was not necessary to check again as it had been searched before and the animal was too big to put in the loft safely. It took another two days, until officers noticed a stench in rooms at the top of the house, for Tia to be found. A so-called ‘cadaver dog’, trained to detect the smell of decomposition, indicated that it was coming from the loft. This time, after removing an overfilled bin bag, officers found Tia wrapped in a ‘body shaped package’ within three feet of the hatch. Unlike the other items it was dust free and her big toe was sticking out through the plastic wrapping. DC Daniel Chatfield said: ‘The loft was extremely confined. It was very hot and quite chaotic. After approximately 10 minutes the body was found . ‘My colleague alerted me to what he believed to be the body of Tia. On the side nearest to me I could see a foot. I could reach her ankles with my arms, it was three foot away at most.’ The missing girl was identified . through DNA testing and dental records. A pathologist could not find a . definitive cause of death. Also . in the loft was a cardboard box containing two other plastic bags, one . with Tia’s yellow top and leggings and another with sweet wrappers and . her broken glasses. Met Commander Neil Basu, who was responsible for finding Tia, insisted the murder victim’s body was ‘well concealed’. He said a review found ‘human error’ in how the searches were conducted and managed was to blame for the extraordinary mistake. Horror: Christine Bicknell, pictured leaving the Old Bailey yesterday with Tia's mother Natalie Sharp, was living in the house not knowing that her granddaughter's body was hidden in her own attic . He added that the PC who first searched the loft was ‘inexperienced’ and he was given ‘words of advice’, the lowest form of disciplinary sanction. The officer has since volunteered to stop undertaking searches. His sergeant, who was responsible for supervising the search, also received ‘words of advice’. Cmdr Basu said: ‘Both officers are devastated by their failure to find Tia and this case has deeply affected all those involved. ‘The Met apologised to Tia’s family as soon as it became apparent that her body had been missed. ‘While the police failure did not contribute to Tia’s death, the Met deeply regrets that this error caused additional distress to Tia’s family by prolonging the situation when it could have been brought to an earlier conclusion.’","Police searched Tia Sharp's grandmother's house four times using dogs .

"Chris Robshaw and his England teammates will be on course for a multi-million pound payday if they beat Ireland in Dublin on Sunday to maintain their Six Nations winning streak. A huge new deal was brokered with the RFU in 2013 which will see the squad share £7.5million if they win the Grand Slam and follow it up with victory at the World Cup. The deal was delivered in an attempt to avert a repeat of the pay dispute before the 2011 World Cup, when England’s players threatened to boycott a dinner held by sponsors O2. Alex Goode catches the high ball watched by coach Mike Catt during England training  held at Pennyhill Park . Each player receives £15,000 per appearance, not allowing for win bonuses, with an ever-present in the Six Nations squad guaranteed £75,000, but with a Grand Slam bonus of £25,000 per player, victory today would leave England needing two more wins to secure a six-figure pay-out. An RFU bonus worth £5m is likely to be shared by the 30-man squad if Stuart Lancaster guides his side to victory in the World Cup on home soil. That is double the amount on offer for winning the 2011 event in New Zealand. England skills coach Catt issues instructions during the England training session ahead of Ireland game . A report commissioned by the tournament organisers has predicted the World Cup will generate almost £1billion of added revenue for the UK economy, with 466,000 extra visitors making it second only to the football World Cup in terms of paying spectators. The scale of the financial rewards on offer has led to inevitable concerns about players being distracted. Asked how England’s management were keeping the side focused in such a huge year for the sport, attack coach Mike Catt — a World Cup winner in 2003 — insisted yesterday he had no concerns about the issue. Chris Robshaw chats with teamate James Haskell during the England Training session at Pennyhill Park . ‘You don’t talk about it,’ he said. ‘You just focus on what they need to do to be better players. It is a very good environment Stuart Lancaster has created with England. ‘The players enjoy it and they really enjoy the brand of rugby as well. They are learning every day. That’s what it is all about in international rugby. ‘We are developing nicely. We are on the right track and the Ireland game is another stepping stone to where this team wants to go or what English rugby wants to do.’ Robshaw shakes hands with Mauro Bergamasco  after the RBS Six Nations match against Italy .","England will win £7.5million if they win the Grand Slam and World Cup .

"Novak Djokovic heralded the most special victory of his career after winning his seventh Grand Slam and second Wimbledon title. The 27-year-old will reclaim the world No 1 spot when the rankings are released on Monday, and he said: ‘It’s definitely the most special. At the time of my career, for this Grand Slam trophy to arrive is crucial, especially after losing three finals in a row. I had started doubting myself a little.’ The Serb admitted he was relieved to win his first Grand Slam since appointing Boris Becker as his coach last December. VIDEO Scroll down to watch champion Djokovic discuss his relationship with coach Becker . Sealed with a kiss: Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer in an epic five-set Wimbledon final . Tears of joy: The Serb hailed his victory as the 'most special' of his career . ‘Many people had doubted him as well,’ said Djokovic. ‘I was close to winning on several occasions, particularly in the fourth set when I served for the match, and I could easily have lost concentration in the fifth and handed him the win. ‘But I didn’t, and that’s why this win has special importance to me mentally. I managed to not just win against my opponent but win against myself as well and find that inner strength that got me the trophy. ‘I think that this year everything got together and emotionally, physically and mentally I was on the top of my abilities. ‘I’m going to try to use it in the best possible way and for my confidence to grow for the rest of my season and my career.’ VIDEO Djokovic wins second Wimbledon title . Thumbs up: Djokovic will overtake Rafael Nadal as World No 1 in the new rankings . Side by side: The Serb won 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 on Centre Court against Federer . Djokovic, who will marry his pregnant fiancee Jelena Ristic in a small ceremony in Montenegro on Wednesday, took a bite out of the grass after beating Roger Federer in five sets — just as he did after defeating Rafael Nadal to win his first Wimbledon title in 2011 — but said the turf tasted even better this time around. ‘I had a nice bite of the grass,’ he said. ‘I thought there was less grass than a few years ago, so I had a little bit of soil as well. But, nevertheless, it tastes like the best meal I ever had in my life. ‘But, sincerely, this has been the best quality Grand Slam final that I ever been part of. I’ve had a longest final against Nadal in the Australian Open 2012 but, quality-wise from the first to last point, this is definitely the best match. To be able to win against Roger, one of my greatest rivals, on this occasion on a court that he’s been dominating for so many years makes it a very special trophy for me. I had tears of joy and was overwhelmed by the moment and the occasion.’ Stretch: The 27-year-old Djokovic took his total of major titles to seven with his second at Wimbledon . Djokovic insisted he was not distracted by the Centre Court crowd’s vociferous support for Federer, the seven-time champion who was consoled by the the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after his defeat. Federer, though, joked that he does ‘not need another’ Wimbledon crown, but said there is still more to come from him, even at the age of 32. The Swiss said: ‘I already have seven. It’s not like I need another one. But it would have been awfully nice to have it. I think that’s what the feeling was of the people, and I felt that. Beaten: Federer joked that he didn't need another Wimbledon title after his defeat on Centre Court . Popular: Federer is a seven-time champion at SW19 and says an eighth would have been 'awfully nice' ‘In a match like the one today where I needed support, they were there. I could sense that they really wished me well and hoped for me to either get back into the match or hopefully lift another trophy here at Wimbledon. ‘I’m very happy to see that, with feeling normal, I can produce a performance like I did in the last two weeks. That clearly makes me believe that this was just a stepping stone to many more great things in the future. ‘I feel like if I’m playing well I feel like I can control the field to a degree. Clearly there’s never a guarantee, but I do believe the top guys are the ones we know and who are still going to be deciding outcomes of the bigger tournaments. I’m very happy to see that I can do it week for week, match for match and point for point. It’s all right there.’","Novak Djokovic won 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 on Centre Court .

"West Brom head coach Tony Pulis has warned any suitors for Saido Berahino he is not prepared to do a deadline-day deal. The Hawthorns boss will not leave himself short of firepower as he tries to steer the Baggies away from relegation trouble. Pulis does not want to sell the 14-goal striker, although he has admitted Albion would consider a huge bid for the England Under-21 international. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has insisted star striker Saido Berahino won't be sold on deadline day . The Baggies boss says only a massive bid would persuade the club to sell their star asset this January . Liverpool and Tottenham have been linked, although neither side have approached the Baggies, and chairman Jeremy Peace this week insisted they want to keep Berahino. And with West Brom in a Barclays Premier League relegation fight Pulis is not prepared to gamble with their top-flight future if he has not signed a replacement. 'I would have to decide and take into account what we've brought in and what we've been left with,' he said, ahead of Saturday's FA Cup trip to Birmingham. 'Staying in the Premier League is vital. What's it worth next year? Hundreds of millions. 'We've not been offered any money yet.

'If the squad wasn't strong enough it would be very difficult to say yes, although you still might take a chance. 'The important thing is that he keeps doing what he's been doing. He's been brilliant around the place.' Pulis is revamping his squad this month and has already given the green light for wingers Silvestre Varela and Sebastian Blanco to go along with Georgios Samaras. Wigan's Callum McManaman remains a target, with Albion having bid twice for the winger, and Pulis has held talks with Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher. 'We've spoken to Darren and had a chat with him. He'll let us know. The timeframe will be deadline day,' said Pulis, who confirmed Nottingham Forest's Michail Antonio was on his radar.

'Mark's worked with me, I played with him at Bournemouth and took him to Gillingham. He know me and I know him, he's a good coach,' he added.

"A self-described Miami ‘party princess’ has been hit with four felony charges after allegedly striking and killing a well-known Miami chef. Karlie Tomica, 20, who styled herself as . a ‘Miami Beach Party Princess Livin’ the Dream’ on her Twitter page, . was charged with DUI manslaughter, leaving the scene of an accident involving death, DUI property damage, and resisting arrest without violence, Friday in a Miami-Dade courtroom. She allegedly ran over executive chef Stefano . Riccioletti early Monday morning steps away from the hotel where he . worked. Scroll down for video . Shock: Karlie Tomica,flanked in court by her parents, Karl and Erin Tomica and her lawyer, Mark Shapiro, is steadied as prosecutors ask for he bail to be increased to $75,000 . Charges: Karlie Tomica, pictured left on her Twitter profile and right, in her booking photo, is accused of leaving the scene of a fatal hit-and-run resulting in the death of a well-known Miami chef . Party girl: Tomica said on her Twitter page that she is a 'party princess' who's 'livin' the dream;' her profile has since been deleted . Loss: Stefano Riccioletti was the executive chef at The Shore Club's Terrazza . The witness who placed the initial 911 call at around 6am yesterday morning described Tomica as being ‘really drunk.’ Tomica was driving a 2007 Dodge Charger along Collins Avenue in Miami Beach and struck 49-year-old Riccioletti yards away from the Shelbourne Hotel. She was apparently driving home after her shift at Nikki Beach, a bar and nightclub. The high-end bar did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. She was initially charged with driving while intoxicated and leaving the scene of an accident, and freed on $10,000 bond, but blood alcohol tests returned this week increased the charge's severity.

Tomica was reportedly steadied by her attorney in court, weeping as prosecutors asked for her bail to be increased to $75,00. She hadn't just killed Riccioletti, prosecutors said, but as a witness in another car followed her she 'actively evaded the [Good Samaritan] and even made U-turns to attempt to lose the car following her.' Her bond was set at $77,000 and she was placed under house arrest with a GPS monitor. She must attend three Alcoholics Anonymous meetings every week. Prosecutors revealed horrific details from the scene, alleging Tomica left the 'battered, bloody and flesh smattered vehicle' all while ignoring pleas to wait for officers.

"Starbucks deny £100million investment is under threat following perceived 'cheap shots' made against the multinational . Starbucks has denied threatening to withhold millions of pounds of investment in Britain after the Prime Minister said tax avoiding companies need to 'wake up and smell the coffee'. The UK boss of the coffee giant reportedly asked for a meeting with David Cameron amid concerns it is being targeted with 'cheap shots' by the Government. However, the multinational said Friday's meeting had been in the diary for a long time and was not booked as a reaction to Mr Cameron. The Prime Minister made the comments at a meeting of world leaders and business bosses at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. It was seen as a swipe at Starbucks, which paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in 14 years of trading in Britain and nothing in the last three years. Asked at the time whether the Davos remarks were aimed at Starbucks, the . Prime Minister's official spokesman said the address 'speaks for . itself'. UK managing director Kris Engskov met Government officials on Friday. While tax issues were likely to have been on the agenda, the company said no threats were made to suspend pledged funding for new UK branches. The Sunday Telegraph quoted an unnamed source that is 'close' to the multinational as saying: 'The PM is singling the business out for cheap shots, a company that, it should not forgotten pledged to pay tax now and in the future.' It said the multinational could suspend plans to invest £100million on new branches in the UK following the criticism, meaning that the creation of new jobs is in doubt. Starbucks has since changed its tax arrangements following a public outcry when the tax avoidance scheme emerged. It will now pay around £10million in corporation tax this year and then automatically when it enters profit - expected to be in about three years. The company said it has made no profits in the UK since its arrival in 1998, apart from one year. Starbucks has faced regular criticism since it emerged last year that it, along with companies such as Amazon and Google, report multimillion pound revenues in the UK but pay little or no tax. David Cameron told the World Economic Forum that tax avoiding companies needed to 'wake up and smell the coffee', which is said to have angered Starbucks . Starbucks was targeted by protesters after it emerged it did not pay corporation tax in the past three years . Last month, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused Starbucks of treating its tax obligations 'like the church collection plate'. Branches have also been targetted by anti-tax avoidance protesters. Starbucks has more than 700 outlets in the UK, generating revenues of more than £3billion. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News that Starbucks had not been singled out for criticism on tax. He said: 'I don't think we would ever . single out a single company but I do think companies in this country . need to pay their way. 'I think they need to do what's right as far as that is concerned and I . think most people watching this would agree, companies should pay their . fair share of taxation. 'That applies to that company and anyone else you care to mention. It . certainly applies to millions of smaller businesses in this country. 'People who work very hard, build up their companies from scratch..., . are paying their fair share of taxes all the way through. The same rules . have to apply to everyone.' A Starbucks spokesman said: 'We had a very constructive meeting which was long-scheduled. We do not discuss the details of our Government meetings but can say that we do not recognise how it has been reported. 'Starbucks agrees with the Prime Minister that all businesses should pay their fair share. 'In the UK, we employ 9,000 people, contribute £300 million a year to the economy and are foregoing tax deductions that will make the Exchequer at least £20 million better off.' Grant Shapps said Starbucks had not been singled out for criticism but said companies 'need to pay their way' The TaxPayers Alliance has called on the Government to simplify tax laws in the UK to attract and keep businesses in the country. Robert Oxley, campaign manager at the pressure group, said: 'It's politicians who are in charge of our broken tax code. 'They are the ones who have the responsibility for fixing it. We have one of the most complex tax codes in the world - with more than 1,700 pages. 'The Government urgently need to simplify and reform our tax system so that companies invest in Britain. 'Starbucks have been particularly stung by the criticism by politicians and the public and their brand recognition went down. 'Tax should not be a moral lecture by the Prime Minister.' Mr Cameron has faced a business backlash . over his campaign to target tax avoidance, with Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein . saying the criticism risked 'criminalising every right-thinking person . who organises his or her affairs in a sensible way'.","Cameron said tax avoiding companies need to 'wake up and smell the coffee'

"Far right views: Front National leader Marine Le Pen could stand trial for racism after the European Parliament lifted her immunity from prosecution . Far right French leader Marine Le Pen is likely to stand trial for racism after comparing Muslims praying in the street to the Nazi occupation of France. Ms Le Pen, 44, risks prosecution after the European Parliament today decided to lift her immunity from prosecution for inciting racial hatred. She could now follow int the footsteps of her father Jean Marie Le Pen who was convicted of racism. Front National leader Ms Le Pen is also an MEP, and under European Parliament rules anyone is technically allowed to say what they like without the risk of prosecution. But the rules state that ‘immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found in the act of committing a (criminal) offence’. Prosecutors in France opened a case against Ms Le Pen for incitement to hatred and discrimination after her comments in 2011. The chief prosecutor in Lyon, in eastern France, asked MEPs to remove Ms Le Pen’s immunity after she said her country was seeing ‘more and more veils’ and ‘more and more burkas’ and ‘after that came prayers in the streets’. In a speech broadcast on French television, she added: ‘I'm sorry, but some people are very fond of talking about the Second World War and about the Occupation, so let's talk about Occupation, because that is what is happening here. ‘There are no tanks, no soldiers, but it is still an Occupation, and it weighs on people’. The words went down particularly badly among France’s six million plus Muslim community – the largest in western Europe. Ms Le Pen took 17.9 per cent  of the vote in the first round of the French presidential election last year, and is a hugely influential politician. Praying in the streets was banned in Paris in 2011 in response to growing Far-Right protests, and a burka ban was also introduced. Influence: Ms Le Pen took 17.9 per cent of the vote in the first round of the French presidential election last year, and is a hugely influential politician . Speaking on French TV on Tuesday, Ms Le Pen defended her remarks, saying she expected to lose her parliamentary immunity ‘because I'm a dissident. I'm not at all afraid of it, I'm scornful of it’. She described the prosecution  as ‘intimidation’, saying she ‘dared to say what all the French people think’. Jean-Marie Le Pen, Ms Le Pen’s father, was stripped of his immunity by European Parliament in 1997 and was later fined by a German court for underplaying the horror of the Holocaust. He also dismissed the Nazi gas chambers as ‘a detail’ of history. Despite his views, Mr Le Pen was runner up to Jacques Chirac in the 2002 presidential election contest in France.","Ms Le Pen, 44, had her immunity from prosecution lifted by European Parliament .

"Chris Evert, who  knows a few things about winning Grand Slams, has urged Andy Murray not to be afraid to appoint a woman to his coaching staff if that is what he wants. The 18-time major champion joined the debate sparked by Amelie Mauresmo watching Murray’s first-round French Open match, and well-sourced reports that the two of them have at least discussed a position working with him. ‘If Andy is thinking about having a woman like Amelie then good for him,’ said Evert. ‘There is no reason why women cannot coach men and they have the experience to coach a top player. Why not? Girl power: Andy Murray has been urged by Chris Evert to sign up a woman as his next coach . Female intuition: Murray was watched by Amelie Mauresmo during his first round match at the French Open . ‘It has not been done much before but that does not mean it would not work, it just has not been tried. If it is blocks of time then maybe that would be attractive. I don’t know how the personalities match up with Andy but she has a lot of experience to pass on. ‘I wouldn’t do it because I have my academy and media work but it is good that Andy is looking at women for coaching.’ If Murray ever wanted evidence of Mauresmo’s motivational powers then he would only have to ask his fellow reigning Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli. The 2006 Wimbledon winner and former world No 1 was a major part of Bartoli’s team when she stormed to unexpected glory at the All England Club and that level of experience appears to have drawn Murray towards the 34- year-old Frenchwoman in the wake of Ivan Lendl’s departure. Neither Murray nor Mauresmo was keen to discuss their prospective partnership yesterday, with the Murray camp declining to comment. Man behind the man: Andy Murray parted company with former coach Ivan Lendl (R) earlier this year . Golden girl: Chris Evert won 18 Grand Slams during her illustrious career . Mauresmo played down the possibility of it becoming reality, but separate sources insist that there has been discussion between them about the post. Murray — who faces Australian Marinko Matosevic on Thursday — understandably keeps his blinkers on during Grand Slams and prefers to squash potential outside distractions. It could well be that if he feels comfortable at Roland Garros with just his trusty lieutenant Dani Vallverdu by his side there will be no appointment but Mauresmo seems to have been in his thoughts.It raises the interesting question of how much impact a woman can have in the macho world of men’s tennis. Evert was not alone in being fascinated by why Mauresmo should spend so much time watching Murray, as highlighted in Sportsmail. ‘It is interesting that Amelie went to watch his entire match. I can’t think why she would do that,’ she said. Head over heels: Mauresmo coached Marion Bartoli to her 2013 Wimbledon victory . From Russia with love: Mikhail Kukushkin is coached by his wife Anastasia . Another former French Open champion, Mary Pierce, felt the same, telling the BBC: ‘Anything is possible. I did notice that she was watching and I thought to myself, “Why is she watching his match?”.’ There are not many female coaches in professional tennis, with most women opting to be guided by men and a major consideration there is that they want the power that a male hitting partner — which many coaches double up as — can provide as the best means of training. With Murray it can be argued that the best coach he ever had was his mother Judy. Against the odds and from a remote outpost of the sport, she managed to equip both him and his brother Jamie with the tools to make it in the professional game. There is actually an example already of female-on-male coaching in the men’s top 100. Mikhail Kukushkin, the world No 54 from Russia, is coached by his wife Anastasia, who began the job when they were courting. 'Mad Dog' and Englishman: Andy Murray will face Marinko Matosevic in his next match at Roland Garros . Mauresmo has been among the groundbreakers in this area. She was alongside another Frenchman, Michael Llodra, over the grass-court season of 2010 when he won the men’s title at Eastbourne. Her TV commitments at the Grand Slams have decreased since last year but she would certainly find herself on screen enough were she to replace Lendl. Around mid-afternoon on Thursday Murray faces world No 66 Matosevic. Although he rejoices in the nickname ‘Mad Dog’ he ought not to hold too many terrors on clay in a best-of-five-sets match.","Chris Evert has urged Andy Murray to choose a woman as his next coach .

"Controversial: Josie Cunningham has admitted to smoking 20 cigarettes a day after discovering she was having a son and not a daughter . A pregnant would-be glamour model who had a breast enlargement on the NHS  has admitted she is drinking and smoking because she is expecting a baby boy, not a girl. Josie Cunningham, 23, said if she knew she was having a son earlier, she would have gone through with the abortion she considered after being asked to appear on Big Brother. As a result, the mother-of-two has turned to alcohol and cigarettes to get over her disappointment. The former escort is now smoking 20 a day, even though she knows it will harm the baby. She has vowed to quit, but has said she needs her GP as well as NHS-funded nicotine patches and counselling to help her kick the habit. Her comments come days after she was pictured smoking before getting into a taxpayer-funded taxi, a service she uses every day because she developed 'anxiety' issues after angry people confronted her on the bus. She told the Sunday Mirror: 'The evening I found out the sex of the baby was when I lit up my first cigarette. I’m not proud of it – but I couldn’t stop myself. It changed everything. 'Once I’d finished the cigarette I found it difficult to focus on anything positive, so I had a small glass of wine. 'My intention was to have one, but before I knew it I was on my second and I’d smoked a whole packet of fags.' Today, Miss Cunningham revealed on Twitter that she will be releasing an autobiography at the end of the year. Her agent Rob Cooper told Mail Online that the book will be 'Josie's exact words, completely unedited', meaning spelling and grammar mistakes will be included. Last week it was revealed that Miss Cunningham, and her two children aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school every day in a journey which costs Leeds Council £30 a day. Miss Cunningham also clashed with Loose Women co-host Myleene Klass during an appearance last Wednesday, suggesting it was wrong that NHS money was used to fund her £4,800 cosmetic surgery. Before her appearance - which caused a stir on Facebook and Twitter - she tweeted a photo of herself in the changing rooms with the message: 'Not long till I'm on Loose Women... Haters are going to hate regardless.' The talk show’s presenters began the interview by saying that it was an opportunity to 'explain her side' after continuous negative publicity. Criticism: She was blasted by Mylene Klass during an appearance on Loose Women last week, suggesting the use of taxpayers' money to fund her breast enlargement was wrong . Miss Cunningham said: 'You expect a bias opinion when you put yourself out there in the media. I won't say I disagree with everything they say. I did the first story so I can be an inspiration for young women or women of any age that are suffering from 0 per cent breast tissue. 'I have received a lot of abuse online and have just been bullied all my life for having no boobs. I am not going to be bullied again.' Anti-smoking advice, counselling, drugs and patches are all available on the NHS, but at a cost to the taxpayer. News that Miss Cunningham had had a breast augmentation, funded by the same NHS Trust that refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk provoked outrage across the country. Disappointed: Miss Cunningham, pictured outside the ITV studios in London, said she had a bottle of wine and a packet of cigarettes the evening after she discovered her future child's gender . Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and said the NHS should pay for a reduction. Then she tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash. But when she became pregnant after working as a £1,000-a-night escort, she admitted she could not uphold her pledge – and now continues to soak up public funds. She has had £1,500 of Botox treatment for excessive sweating, and two months ago, she boasted she would be having £2,500 of free dental work now she is expecting. And earlier this year, the publicity-hungry mother threatened to have an abortion after being invited to go on Big Brother. Yesterday Miss Cunningham told how she and her children, aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day. The journey, which costs Leeds Council £30 a day, would cost around £30 a week by bus, but Miss Cunningham insisted it was worth it, and said taxpayers should be grateful it was taxis rather than more expensive private hire cars. Writer: The mother-of-two has also admitted she will be releasing a book at the end of the year. It will be autobiographical and unedited, meaning spelling and grammar mistakes will be left in .","Josie Cunningham admits she has been smoking 20 a day while pregnant .

"An 11-year-old Tennessee girl died earlier this week of complications from the flu just three days after contracting the potentially deadly virus. The death of Savannah Hyden is just the latest in a growing number of flu-related deaths that has health officials worried. Hyden died about 5 p.m. Wednesday at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital near Vanderbilt University near Nashvilled. According to her parents, the girl had not been given a flu vaccine this year. Tragic: Savannah Hayden is the latest child to do die from complications related to the flu . Fear: Hyden's mother, Natasha Renee Fiser, said she didn't get the girl vaccinated out of fear over potential side effects . 'She was brilliant in every aspect,' her father, Steven Hyden, told the Tennessean. 'We have really taken a big loss. ... She could have been the president.' Hayden's mother, Natasha Renee Fiser, told the paper that her daughter developed a bacterial infection after contracting the flu. The infection caused the girl to go into cardiac arrest. 'She was down for too long, there was no oxygen to her brain, and her organs just started shutting down,' Fiser said. Fiser says she was shocked that her daughter got sick and then three days later was put on life support. 'Brilliant': Hyden's father describes his daughter as a brilliant girl who loved art, particularly glass-blowing . Hayden's parents say they declined to get their daughter vaccinated because they were worried about the potential side effects sometimes caused by the vaccine. 'You only think [vaccines] for the weak and the elderly — those that don’t have the immunity to fight it off,' Fiser said. 'You would never imagine that a healthy child really would need the flu shot at all.' Hayden, the girl's parents admit, did not have health insurance. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, everyone over six months old - with a few exceptions - should get a flu shot. People who worry about the side effects can ask to get a preservative-free form of the vaccine. Forms of flu strains often change, but this year's strain is H1N1, which first emerged in the U.S. in 2009. In the 2009-2010 flu season, 12,000 people died from the virus - or complications caused by the disease - across the U.S. In Nashville, at least 10 people have been killed by the flu so far this year. Despite the risks of potential side effects, health officials urge everyone to get a flu shot.","Savannah Hyden went into cardiac arrest as a result of complications from the flu .

"An illegal immigrant made it into Britain after clinging to the bottom of a coach bringing school pupils back from France - for 220miles. The 35-year-old stowaway, from Sudan, risked his life by hanging on to the axle underneath the vehicle all the way from Calais to Birmingham. He was arrested by police after shocked pupils spotted him after the group arrived back at Perry Beeches Academy in Great Barr, Birmingham, late on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Liam Nolan, head of Perry Beeches Academy in Birmingham has hit out at authorities after an illegal immigrant was able to sneak under his school's bus in Calais and cling on to an axle all the way to the Midlands . Executive head Liam Nolan said the man fell out onto the concrete in the school car park suffering from severe exhaustion following his marathon journey. Mr Nolan said: 'He just stumbled out from underneath the coach, and the teachers looked after him, rang the police and called the headteacher. 'A lot of us today have been thinking about that man, and the pupils have been asking after him. 'He was of no danger at all to the pupils or staff at the school. His interest was not to endanger anyone, but, I presume, to come to the UK to better his own life.' The drama came at the end of a four-day trip to show pupils the Bayeux Tapestry in Normandy, northern France. Mr Nolan said the incident could jeopardise future school trips and criticised authorities for failing to spot the man at the French port. He added: 'Can't we take our children to the Bayeux Tapestry because of the Border Agency? It is outrageous. 'We take the children to historical events and that is being hampered.' Children from the school were returning from a trip to Normandy when the Sudanese man sneaked aboard . The 35-year-old immigrant clung onto the bus from Calais to Dover then along the motorway to Birmingham . Worried parents also reacted angrily to the incident, saying the stowaway could easily have been a terrorist. Paula Bowen, 43, said: 'It is very worrying and I'll be thinking twice about letting my daughter go on school trips abroad in future. 'He could have been anyone, its terrifying to think he had been under the bus for all that time.' Another parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The first coach arrived back about 11pm and people heard a banging noise from the back of the coach. 'We couldn't believe it when a man appeared from underneath it. I am appalled immigrants are even using school trips as a way of sneaking into Britain.' Tom Brew, 25, whose 12-year-old brother George was on the coach, added: 'What if this guy had a bomb?' The Port of Calais has seen increased numbers of immigrants in recent months all trying to get to Britain . A West Midlands Police spokesman confirmed an investigation had been launched into the incident. He said: 'Police were called to Perry Beeches School in Great Barr just before 11pm on Saturday 20 September after a man was found on the axle of a coach returning from a school trip to France. 'The 35-year-old from Sudan was arrested and is being dealt with the UK Border Force.' The government has pledged £12 million to help France tackle the problem of illegal immigrants trying to enter Britain through Calais. The deal was announced on Saturday by home secretary Theresa May, and France's minister of interior, Bernard Cazeneuve. Officials in France have even threatened to close the port if more is not done to tackle the issue . It will also see increased co-operation between law enforcement agencies and the UK will give £4million a year for three years to a joint fund. It will be used to build robust fences and bolster security at the parking area of Calais port, which migrants use as a staging post for efforts to cross the Channel. Yesterday, Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'The security of the UK border is our first priority, which is why the Government has spent millions of pounds on strengthening controls and upgrading technology at Calais and Coquelles. 'As our border controls become stronger, we are seeing illegal immigrants taking increasingly dangerous risks to enter the UK. 'We are working with the French authorities to help tighten up security even more to stop this from happening.'","Pupils had been on trip to Normandy to see the Bayeux Tapestry .

"It may sound like a scene from Star Wars, but scientists have developed a way of controlling genes using just the power of the human mind. In a similar way that Luke Skywalker uses the Force to control objects, researchers believe their breakthrough technique could one day offer the hope of controlling chronic headaches, back pain and epilepsy. During tests, human participants were able to make genes in mice produce a specific protein using their thoughts. During tests, human participants were able to make genes in mice produce a specific protein using their thoughts. Scientists believe the bizarre experiment, in which volunteers were wired up to a machine that read their brainwaves, (pictured) could lead to mind-operated implants for treating disease . In the gene expression experiment, volunteers wore brainwave-recording headsets linked to an electrical current generator. By thinking in a certain way, they were able to wirelessly turn on the gene chip, causing it to emit near infra-red LED light. This activated light-sensitive cells in the chip, triggering a cascade of signals that ultimately turned on on the gene for a marker protein called secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (Seap). Implanted into mice, the chip released the protein into the animals' bloodstreams. The method of producing protein in cells is known as  gene expression. Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich believe the bizarre experiment, in which volunteers were wired up to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine that read their brainwaves, could lead to mind-operated implants for treating disease. The  researchers compared the study to Luke Skywalker mastering the Force in George Lucas' Star Wars franchise. They said they were also inspired by the game Mindflex, in which players wearing headsets use their brainwaves to 'thought control' a small ball through an obstacle course by operating a fan.

Lead scientist Professor Martin Fussenegger said: 'For the first time, we have been able to tap into human brainwaves, transfer them wirelessly to a gene network and regulate the expression of a gene depending on the type of thought.' 'Being able to control gene expression via the power of thought is a dream that we've been chasing for over a decade.' To regulate the amount of released protein, participants were asked to adopt three different states of mind - bio-feedback, meditation and concentration. The researchers compared the study to Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill pictured left with Yoda) mastering the Force in George Lucas' Star Wars franchise. They said they were also inspired by the game Mindflex, in which players use their brainwaves to 'thought control' a small ball through an obstacle course . By thinking in a certain way, they were able to wirelessly turn on the gene chip (pictured), causing it to emit near infra-red LED light. This activated light-sensitive cells and triggered signals that  turned on on the gene for a protein called Seap. Implanted into mice, the chip released the protein into the animals' bloodstreams . Those who were concentrating on playing a computer game, produced average levels of Seap in the mice. But when completely relaxed in the meditation state, they generated very high amounts of the protein. For the bio-feedback test, volunteers watched the chip's LED light up in the body of a mouse and were consciously able to switch it on or off with their thoughts. This was reflected by varying amounts of Seap in the animal. Thought-controlled implants may one day be used to combat neurological diseases such as chronic headache, back pain and epilepsy,  Professor Fussenegger explained. The implants would work by detecting specific brainwaves at an early stage and triggering the production therapeutic agents at just the right time. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.","Volunteers wore headsets linked to an electrical current generator .

"It's fair to say Robin van Persie hasn't scored quite as many goals as he would have liked over the last few months. Maybe he could learn a thing or two from this man... Hristo Stoichkov. Van Persie bumped into the former Bulgarian footballer while on international duty with Holland, and took a picture for his 6.5 million Twitter followers, alongside the message 'Was very nice to meet Hristo Stoichkov today. Legend!' Stoichkov is most famous for his 151 appearances in a Barcelona shirt, where he scored 77 goals, and in 2004 he was voted in Pele's list of the 125 greatest living footballers. Robin van Persie poses with his thumb up for a photo with Bulgarian football legend Hristo Stoichkov . Stoichkov scored 38 goals in 84 caps for the Bulgarian national team . The Bulgarian divided football fans during his playing career - he was loved by some but denounced by others, once claiming 'No Bulgarian will ever match my achievements.' A bold statement, but perhaps one that will ring true. The pair were in good spirits as they smiled for the photo, and Manchester United fans will be hoping Stoichkov left their striker with a few words of inspiration.

After winning her first qualifying match, 18-year-old American Duval, ranked No 114 in the world, received the news that she had been diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Rather than pulling out, Duval continued to play and qualified for the Championships, beating world No 29 Sorana Cirstea in the first round before going out to Belinda Bencic. As the cancer was caught in the early stages, a full recovery is expected. Hero: Victoria Duval received the news she had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma . CHAMPIONSHIPS VILLAIN .

Most bizarre: Serena Williams was in no mood to talk at her pre-tournament press conference . ODDEST SIGHT . Serena Williams (again) Three days later, Serena returned to the All England Club with sister Venus to play their second-round ladies’ doubles match. Serena appeared faint and was examined by medical staff before going on court. When it came for Serena to serve she could hardly bounce the ball and wildly served four consecutive double faults before retiring at 0-3 down. The explanation was a viral illness.

"It's certainly a novel way to improve the interaction between man and bird. A new sport has been launched which gives paragliders the opportunity to interact with vultures as they glide above the land: Parahawking. Invented by avian expert Scott Mason to highlight the plight of Asia's endangered vultures, the sport combines ancient falconry methods with the modern techniques of paragliding, where both parties use rising currents of warm air to glide high above the land. Way to go! The vulture comes in for a tasty morsel mid-air . 'Birds of prey are able to gain height and fly long distances without flapping their wings,' explains Mason. 'We as paragliders harness their natural ability to conserve energy by following them as we fly.' During the flight paragliders place small morsels of meat onto their gloved hands and the birds gently land to take the food, then fly gracefully away to find the next thermal. 'It's a perfect symbiotic relationship,' Mason said. 'Parahawking has gone from a personal experiment to a global phenomenon whereby several hundred people each year are taken on a tandem flight and given the unique opportunity to fly and interact with a bird of prey in its own environment.' Couples strapped together as they paraglide can take advantage of the thermals used by the birds flying alongside them . Vultures are often misunderstood and have a rather unsavory image, says Mason . Asia's vultures are virtually on the brink of extinction due to a drug called Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug commonly administered to sick and dying livestock across Asia which is poisonous to vultures. When the birds feed from animal carcasses that have been treated with Diclofenac, it causes renal failure and death. The White Backed Vulture, The Slender Billed Vulture and the Long Billed Vulture have declined 99.9 per cent in the last 15 years, meaning 40 million birds have died. 'Vultures are often misunderstood and have a rather unsavory image,' says Mason. 'By using vultures for Parahawking we hope to change our perceptions of them. Parahawking is our unique and innovative contribution to help prevent the potential extinction of this important species.' Steve Mason is hoping that parahawking will help prevent the potential extinction of the Asian vulture . 'By interacting and connecting with these majestic birds of prey we intend to raise awareness of the vultures' plight.' If you're wondering why all the fuss about vultures, they play a vital role by disposing of dead matter that would otherwise pose a risk of disease, explains Mason. Due to their decline there there has been a dramatic increase in feral dog numbers, which pose a risk to human health. Parahawking is not just a joyride. It's an education in bird of prey behaviour and conservation as a whole. Parahawking supports vulture conservation by donating 1000 rupees from every Parahawking tandem experience to selected vulture conservation projects in Nepal. The parahawking season, based in Pokhara, Nepal, runs from around October to April. To try your hand at the sport, the price for is around £225 including two night's accommodation. It seems the sport is gaining in popularity: The Parahawking Project recently celebrated the sport's number one ranking as the top activity in Pokhara on TripAdvisor.","Paragliders 'fly' alongside birds of prey thousands of metres above the land .

"This micro pig must be barking mad. Gilbert was bought as a tiny companion to a pair of Yorkshire Terriers has grown up thinking he's a dog - and now begs for biscuits and rolls over. The two-year-old was raised with the dogs after his owners snapped him up during the craze to have the miniature animals as family pets. But it is thought the Yorkie's behaviour rubbed off on confused Gilbert and now the pig will come when he's called, roll over on command and even beg for a biscuit. Scroll down for video . Good pig! Gilbert begs Mel Haye from the Sanctuary, for a treat. The confused porker's favourite snacks are dog biscuits and bananas . Peek-a-pig! Gilbert pokes his head through the cat flap, and loves to beg and roll over . He also bangs on the door with his snout to be let into the house, gives kisses to his masters and mistresses and tries to help bring in the post too. But despite his canine-like talents, Gilbert who started life no bigger than the size of teacup has had to be given a new home after he grew so big his owners were unable to cope with him. He is now starting a new life at Wilmslow Animal Sanctuary, in Wilmslow, Cheshire - with his old owners making regular visits and making donations towards his upkeep. Trustee and fundraising coordinator, Melanie Hay, said: 'Gilbert is just like a dog, it's so funny he honestly believes he is one. 'He's big like a dog in size and when you call his name he comes running. 'He sits very well and he will roll over when you ask him to. Gilbert wasn't abandoned but his family decided they could no longer look after him and asked the sanctuary to take him . 'He just loves playing and he can beg for biscuits like a dog too. He loves to run around and be silly and he has his mad half hours just like dogs. 'If he wants to come inside he bangs on the door with his snout or sticks his head through the cat flap. 'He goes and gets the post but instead of bringing it to us he runs off with it and won't give us it back. 'I think a lot of his ""doggy"" behaviour has to do with the fact that with his original owners he was brought up with two Yorkshire terrier's. 'I think a lot of how they were must have rubbed off on him. 'He's a real character and he just loves interacting with people. 'The other day he went in my handbag and ran off with my banana, just like a puppy. I had to chase him for it and when I took it from him he just looked at me and gave this loud grunt.' Micro pigs are a miniature breed, which start out no bigger than a teacup, before growing to a slightly smaller size than a normal pig, around human knee height. Celebrities such as Paris Hilton bought the tiny piglets and were shocked when the ballooned in size. How much is that piggy in the window? The little porker became confused after living with two Yorkshire Terriers . However, although Gilbert's previous owners knew he would grow, they could no longer look after him. Melanie continued: 'Gilbert's original owners knew what they were getting when they got Gilbert, it wasn't a surprise when he got so big. 'But they were moving house and where they were moving to didn't have a garden, so they couldn't take Gilbert with them. 'They visit him all the time and they make donations to the sanctuary for looking after him. 'The good thing is that now he's living the most wonderful life, he talks to the chickens, he's got the ponies as friends and he's got another potbellied pig too. 'Gilbert will stay with us now as part of the sanctuary. His owners know where he is and can come and visit and he's having a fabulous time too. 'He's happy here and we're happy to have to him. 'We've got a real assortment of animals here, we've got 12 ponies, a donkey, two pigs, a lot of chickens, five ferrets, three rabbits and 25 cats, who live here as they cannot be rehomed. 'It costs about £200,000 to keep them all and we don't get support from anywhere except public donations.

"A gang of Eastern European men have been jailed for more than 15 years for robbing a John Lewis warehouse. The four men stole £200,000 worth of electronic goods from the firm's distribution centre in Brackmills, Northampton. Northampton Crown Court heard how Marcin Bakowski, 30, an ex-employee at John Lewis, wanted revenge after he was sacked for stealing food from the staff canteen. Marcin Bakowski, 30 (left) led current John Lewis employee Krzysztof Bogszewski, 33 (right) and two others in their £200,000 raid. Bakowski i said to have wanted revenge after he was fired from the store . Piotr Kozlowski, 31 (left) was recruited as the 'muscle' behind the operation and Vitalijs Razadovskis, 26 was to sell the good on. The court heard that the gang was 'clueless' about what to do once with the stolen gear . Bakowski masterminded the raid, during which the gang used a sniper rifle to shoot a CCTV camera to avoid detection and escaped through a makeshift tunnel made from wooden pallets. The court was told that he hired warehouse porter Krzysztof Bogszewski, 33, for inside information and involved friends Piotr Kozlowski, 31 and Vitalijs Razadovskis, 26. Judge Michael Fowler said: 'There was a significant degree of planning and organisation' in the burglary. Bogszewski left the main gate open when he finished his shift and blocked a motion sensor so the men would not be detected. The gang cut one of the doors open to prevent an alarm from going off and took Apple equipment and Sony and Samsung laptops. They were detected after police traced the stole Apple items and tracked their mobile phone records. Judge Fowler said: 'This was an exceptionally valuable burglary.' The group were sentenced to more than 15 years in total. The gang had done the groundwork for their raid on John Lewis warehouse in Brackmillls. They made sure the gates were left open for them and they shot at CCTV cameras so they wouldn't be detected . Bakowski was jailed for five years, after pleading guilty to burglary and five charges of theft while he worked at John Lewis. Bogszewski was sentenced to five and a half years in prison after he was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle following a trial last month. Kozlowski was jailed for three years for conspiracy to burgle and Razadovski was sentenced to one year and 10 months for handling stolen goods. Police discovered many people had bought the stolen goods directly from Bakowski - who had used his mobile phone to contact buyers. All four defendants are likely to be deported once they are released.","Four men stole 180 iPads and 26 MacBooks from Northampton warehouse .

"Thick scars coloured dull red and black cover the backs of women belonging to Ethiopia's Hamar tribe, the legacy of an initiation rite that sees them beaten bloody. No screaming is permitted by the men wielding the canes but the women don't care. Instead of fleeing, they beg the men to do it again and again until blood flows, dripping into the gritty red dust of the Omo River Valley. Now the Hamar and their unique culture that merges the beautiful and the brutal in equal measure are the subject of a series of incredible photographs created by French lensman, Eric Lafforgue. Brutal: Hamar women volunteer to be beaten by 'Maza' (initiated men) during their brothers' coming of age ceremonies. They show off their scars with pride . Tough girl: Like their men, Hamar women are expected to play a role in protecting the family cattle from rustlers and predatory wildlife . Patterned: Both men and women have intricate designs carved into their skin using thorns (left) and share a love of colourful jewellery . Lafforgue travelled to Ethiopia after spotting pictures of the Hamar in a vintage book and hopes his photos will provide a record of a culture under threat from encroaching modernity. His striking images reveal the beauty of Hamar women in their orange ochre make-up and bright beads, their skin scarred into intricate patterns using thorns, resilient as they live a life that's precarious at best and brutal at worst. But not everything about the Hamar is . troubling. For the Hamar, cattle are everything, and for the men, they . form a key part of the rite that turns them from boy to man. At cattle jumping ceremonies, young men are required to leap across 15 cows, smeared with dung to make them slippery. If . he fails, he cannot marry and will be beaten by the watching women. At the same ceremony, his . female relatives are beaten to create a blood debt between the man and . his sisters who show off their scars with pride. Homemakers: Women take on all of the domestic chores as well as childcare and the lion's share of sowing the sorghum crops the tribe needs to survive . Adornment: Both men and women use orange make-up on their faces and bodies, in the men's case with white paint in order to create a leopard-like effect . Rite: Wonderfully beaded and ochre painted Hamar women dance themselves into a frenzy as they take part in a colourful ritual while their men look on out of shot . Pride: A Hamar woman shows off her scars, including some recently inflicted ones. The three necklaces reveal that she is a high status first wife . 'While the boys walk on cows, Hamar women . accompany him: they jump and sing,' reveals Lafforgue, who witnessed a ceremony. 'The more abundant and extensive the . initiate’s scars are, the deeper the girls' affection is to the boy who is . about to become a man. 'Totally committed to their initiated sons, the . mothers are whipped to blood, in order to prove their courage and . accompany their sons during the test.' But for Hamar women, beatings are not just part of an initiation ritual - they are daily life until at least two children have been born. Under Hamar rules, a man need not explain why he's delivering a beating. It is his prerogative to mete out as he sees fit. Men can also have more than one wife, with junior wives left to do the lion's share of the planting and water gathering. 'They do not have really the choice,' says Lafforgue. 'As . [with] many women in Africa, they carry water, wood, take care . of the food and the kids, while the men take care of the cows - the . Hamar treasure. 'Hamar men can . have several wives,' he adds.'The Hamar women who are not a first wife have a . really hard life and they are more slaves than wives. '[But] seeing those women with their animal skins, their special hairstyles, and their body covered with this orange make up was fascinating.' Protection: This Hamar girl's battered old rifle contrasts starkly with her beauty and spectacular beaded necklace and headband . Work: Hamar women are responsible for all domestic duties including fetching water, cooking, cleaning the home and looking after the children . Happy: Two friends take a break from their back-breaking array of chores and farm work to share a joke and a smile together . Intricate: A Hamar woman shows of her carefully braided hair and treasure trove of bright beads, shells and metal bangles . Despite the violence, Lafforgue hopes that his photos will provide a record of a way of life that is slowly dying out. ' I always take photographs for two reasons,' he explains. 'First, providing a testimony as many tribes are starting to disappear but also to show the world how other people live, even if some of the . time they have shocking practices.' He tells the story of meeting a Hamar boy who had walked for several days to a local town, just to see his favourite Premier League football team on television. 'This guy was wearing a Chelsea T-shirt, but still had to . jump over ten bulls to be able to marry a girl in his tribe: a real . culture shock. 'They are all really into Chelsea, Arsenal, like . many other Ethiopians, who are just crazy about English football' With more and more Hamar swapping traditional life for Arsenal shirts, the days of beatings and cattle jumping would appear to be numbered. See more of Eric's work at ericlafforgue.com . The majority of the 20,000 strong Hamar people live in the Omo River Valley, a fertile part of the vast Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region of south-west Ethiopia, which is bordered by Kenya and South Sudan. Most still live in traditional villages, although growing numbers are migrating to the region's cities and towns as well as the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Cattle form the axis around which the Hamar's world revolves, evidenced by the fact that there are 27 different words to describe the colour of a cow in the local language. Men spend the majority of the time caring for the animals, which are also used to pay bride prices when the man takes a wife - always a woman from the Hamar tribe - and generally amounts to 30 goats and 20 cows. Cows also form part of the male initiation rite, which involves contenders attempting to leap over a row of 15 cows made extra slippery with dung. At the same ceremony, the man's sisters and other female relatives are beaten bloody to create a blood debt so the man remembers to help them should they face tough times in the future. While cattle-leaping is relatively harmless, another practice, known as 'mingi' is more troubling. 'The Hamar tribe still practises ritual infanticide,' Lafforgue explains. 'If the first tooth appears in the upper jaw, instead of the lower, the child becomes what they called 'mingi' - this applies also to the baby teeth and the adult teeth when the kids are seven or eight. 'If a 'mingi' child is kept in the village by the mother, elders believe droughts, famines and diseases will come in the community, so they kill the babies. Most 'mingi' children are left in the desert alone to die, although local charities now regularly check the area for abandoned children which are then raised in orphanages away from the tribe.","Ceremonial beatings take place during the male initiation rites but also in the home when the husband chooses .

"Syrian rebels have killed at least 190 civilians and taken 200 hostages as the country's bitter civil war rages, Human Rights Watch claimed today. As a chemical watchdog won the Nobel Peace Prize today for overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, government forces and rebels clashed across the country with conventional weapons. HRW said many of the dead had been executed by militant groups, some linked to al Qaeda, who overran army positions at dawn on August 4 and then moved into 10 villages nearby where members of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect lived.

Smoke rises after a mortar shell hits a residential area during fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels in Maaret al-Numan in the Idlib province . In its first government-sanctioned trip into Syria during the 2-1/2-year conflict, New York-based HRW has documented a series of sectarian mass killings by Assad's foes during a broader campaign in which Western-backed rebels took part. In some cases, entire families were executed or gunned down as they fled, according to a report titled 'You Can Still See Their Blood'. HRW identified five rebel groups instrumental to funding, organising, planning and carrying out the Latakia attacks, including the al Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant groups, as well as the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham and another unit of foreign jihadi fighters. These groups publicised their involvement through videos and statements, some of which were used to corroborate the HRW report. The operation appeared to have been largely financed by private Gulf-based donors, HRW said.

The conflict erupted in 2011 when mainly peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule were put down with force . It is unclear to what extent the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the armed wing of the main opposition coalition which is openly supported by the United States, Britain, France and Sunni Muslim Gulf states, played. In a video posted on August 11 and apparently filmed in Latakia, FSA chief Salim Idriss said the body was participating in the offensive 'to a great extent.' But HRW researcher Lama Fakih, who spent several days in Latakia province in September and spoke to residents, soldiers, militiamen, doctors and officials, said she could not confirm if the FSA were present on August 4 when the atrocities took place. Assad's forces are also accused by rights groups of committing atrocities and using incendiary and cluster bombs in populated areas . Assad's forces are also accused by rights groups of committing atrocities and using incendiary and cluster bombs in populated areas. They have carried out sectarian attacks, including killing up to 450 civilians in two massacres in mainly Sunni Muslim areas in May, according to U.N. officials. The opposition and rights groups accuse Damascus of a chemical weapons strike in a Damascus suburb on August 21 that killed hundreds of civilians. The government blames the attack on rebels. Not all 20 rebel groups mentioned in the HRW report were available to comment. Syrian National Coalition spokesman Khaled Saleh said the SNC condemns all human rights abuses and if any had been committed by rebels affiliated with the coalition, they would face justice. A member of the Sunni Islamist Ahrar al-Sham said its fighters had killed no civilians in the offensive. The scale and organisation of the attacks on civilians suggest premeditation and make them a crime against humanity, HRW said, rather than isolated war crimes reported during the Syrian civil war. The United Nations says the conflict has killed more than 100,000 people in two-and-a-half years. Syria's mainly Sunni Muslim rebels are battling to overthrow Assad, whose Alawite sect is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam and accounts for about 12 percent of Syria's 23 million people. The conflict erupted in 2011 when mainly peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule were put down with force. As the war rages, the global chemical weapons watchdog charged with destroying chemical weapons stockpile won the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize today. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a relatively small organisation with a modest budget, dispatched 27 of its experts after a sarin gas attack killed more than 1,400 people in August. Their deployment, supported by the United Nations, helped avert a U.S. strike against President Bashar al-Assad. The OPCW's mission was unprecedented in taking place during a civil war that has riven the country and killed more than 100,000 people.","HRW said villagers executed by militant groups, some linked to al Qaeda .

"Barack Obama visited the Colosseum in Rome in the latest stop on his European tour, calling the ancient area 'remarkable' and 'unbelivable'. The US President was full of praise for the monument, once used for gladiatorial bouts during the days of the Roman Empire, as he was given a guided tour of the historic Italian site. Mr Obama was clearly impressed by the scale of the huge arena as he was shown around by the Colosseum's technical director Barbara Nazzaro. Scroll down for video . Impressed: Barack Obama visited the Colosseum in Rome in the latest stop on his European tour, calling the ancient area 'remarkable' and 'unbelievable' Remarkable: The US President was full of praise for the monument as he was given a guided tour by the Colosseum's technical director Barbara Nazzaro . History lesson: Construction of the Colosseum began under the emperor Vespasian in 70 AD,and was completed in 80 AD under his successor and heir Titus . During a tour that lasted about . half an hour, Mr Obama was asked whether he could imagine the Colosseum in its day. 'This is . bigger than some current baseball stadiums,' said Mr Obama, who is a fan of . the Chicago White Sox baseball team. 'I have to check on what it seats. It's remarkable. Unbelievable.' But he was almost lavish as in his praise for the Colosseum as he was for Italy's 39-year-old Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who has set a testing agenda of economic and . constitutional reforms to help the eurozone's third-largest economy . recover from its longest recession since World War Two. 'I want to say that I've just been impressed by the energy and vision that Matteo's bringing to his position,' Mr Obama said during an hour-long joint news conference in Rome. 'There's a seriousness and ambition of ideas, and I think the spirit and the energy of the Italian people has the opportunity to be unleashed in a way that will be good for Italy, but it will also be good for Europe,' he said. Monument: Dressed in a heavy black overcoat, Mr Obama appeared impressed with his tour of the historic site . Tour: Mr Obama has arrived in Italy as part of his visit to Europe . On guard: A member of the US Secret Service stands watch as Mr Obama tours the Colosseum . Taking in the view: Mr Obama looks out over the vast arena, which once housed gladiatorial battles as well as epic dramas based on ancient mythology . 'So it's wonderful to see this new generation of leadership coming to the fore.' The comments were a welcome boost to Mr Renzi, who took over leadership of Italy's cross-party ruling coalition after a party coup last month, pledging to push forward more aggressively on reforms than his predecessor Enrico Letta. Over the past two weeks, Mr Renzi has met French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to seek their backing for a more ambitious push to lift the economy out of the doldrums. With memories still fresh of Italy's central role in the eurozone crisis which took the single currency to the brink of collapse in 2011, leaders around the world have been watching Mr Renzi closely as he has launched into his agenda. Diplomacy: Mr Obama was almost lavish as in his praise for the Colosseum as he was for Italy's 39-year-old Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (right) Impressed: During an hour-long joint news conference, Mr Obama said he was impressed by Mr Renzi's 'energy and vision' Breaking occasionally into English and making frequent references to the importance of the U.S. alliance and the sacrifices of American soldiers during World War Two, Mr Renzi could scarcely conceal how pleased he was by the visit and pledged to continue with his programme of change. 'Italy has no alibi,' he said. 'Italy cannot think that its own problems and its own opportunities can come from the outside, from Europe or the United States. We have to change ourselves.' The mutual congratulations concealed more delicate issues, notably over Italy's reconsideration of its planned order for 90 F-35 combat jets, which Mr Renzi's centre-left Democratic Party wants to cut 'significantly' to ease the pressure on its strained public finances. Positive: The comments were a welcome boost to Mr Renzi, who took over leadership of Italy's cross-party ruling coalition after a party coup last month . All smiles: Mr Obama poses with Mr Renzi during a ceremonial welcoming at Villa Madama in Rome . Push: Over the past two weeks, Mr Renzi has met French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to seek their backing for a more ambitious push to lift the economy out of the doldrums . The ambitious timetable Mr Renzi has set himself for the coming three months has also run into some headwinds in parliament which are likely to grow as his campaign against the entrenched privileges of the political class continue. Mr Obama avoided directly commenting on the F-35 issue but said that despite the need to make defence spending around the world more efficient, America's NATO allies had to keep defence budgets on an upward trajectory with 'everybody pitching in'. He contrasted the US record of spending three per cent of its economic output on defence with Europe, which spent one per cent. There was also no word on the backroom manoeuvres currently taking place to choose a new secretary general of NATO. Former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg has been seen as front-runner with the backing of the United States but former Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini is also in the race.","US President full of praise for the huge Roman arena .

"David Moyes has backed Real Madrid to become the first team ever to retain the Champions League after Carlo Ancelotti's side mauled Real Sociedad 4-1 despite missing Cristiano Ronaldo. It was Moyes' first defeat to Ancelotti in their seventh meeting and asked if he thought they could retain the European Cup they won last May, he said: 'From what I've seen I think that they can. They have so much variety in the way they attack you. 'They've got different types of players and always with an incredibly strong bench. It's not been done before and that shows you how hard it is but with a bit of luck I think they might have what it takes.' Karim Benzema slots home Real Madrid's fourth of the afternoon during their 4-1 win against Real Sociedad . Benzema gestures towards the supporters as he is congratulated by his team-mates at the Bernabeu . Sociedad boss David Moyes believes Real Madrid are good enough to retain the Champions League . Asked about Ronaldo's absence Moyes added: 'Big clubs don't rely on one player, big clubs rely on their team and their squad.' Gareth Bale assisted for Karim Benzema in the win but was also booed by a small section of supporters for missing a string of chances including one he appeared to take off the boot of team-mate James Rodriguez. But Moyes said: 'I didn't hear the booing but if Bale keeps on getting the opportunities he's going to score a lot of goals because he's a top player.' The former Everton and Manchester United manager would love to have the options open to his rival Ancelotti. Real Sociedad bought no one in the transfer window and could now be without top scorer Carlos Vela for a month with a knee injury.

James Rodriguez equalises for Real Madrid as Carlo Ancelotti's side recovered from going a goal down . James is mobbed by his team-mates after Real Madrid come up with an instant reply against David Moyes's side at the Bernabeu . Moyes bemoned the way the Spanish transfer window closed on Friday a full three days before most other big leagues in Europe. He said: 'There are only 31 days in January and Spain actually gives you fewer days, because we closed on Friday night. 'Of nearly all the transfers in January, a big percentage of them will be done on the last day. I don't think it's good for La Liga that you can move people out of Spain but you cannot move people in. 'I could have done with an extra day in the end especially now knowing that Carlos Vela has an injury.' Mangers Moyes and Carlo Ancelotti share a warm embrace before the match at the Bernabeu . Gareth Bale, who missed a great chance to score in the first half, takes control of the ball . Benzema wheels away in celebration after scoring Real Madrid's third goal against Sociedad . Despite the hammering there are signs that Moyes is developing Real Sociedad's younger players.

Goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who is only 22 was outstanding saving at point blank from Bale and of 22-year-old midfielder Ruben Pardo, Moyes said: 'I thought he was excellent he could have been wearing a Real Madrid shirt and he wouldn't have been out of place.'","Real Madrid beat David Moyes' Real Sociedad 4-1 on Saturday .

"Diego Maradona’s lovelife appears to have taken a turn for the better as he was filmed serenading his girlfriend in Dubai. The legendary footballer sang an impromptu love song to his on-off partner Rocio Oliva, 24, during a product launch. This comes just two weeks after a video emerged appearing to show the 54-year-old physically assaulting Ms Oliva. Scroll down for video . Bizarre: Diego Maradona interrupted a product launch to serenade his 24-year-old on-again girlfriend . Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’. Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, then looks lovingly at Ms Oliva, whom he has been dating on and off since the beginning of last year. The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone. Ms Oliva secretly filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone.' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting.' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. Forgive and forget: The 54-year-old seemed to have patched things up with his young love following the release of a video where Ms Oliva secretly filmed what appeared to be Maradona assaulting her . It's back on: Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’ The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone . The video was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme in Argentina, after which the Hand of God insisted he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there. 'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.' Maradona and Ms Oliva have broken up and reunited several times during the course of their relationship, and the couple were even engaged for a short time before breaking it off. In May last year Maradona allegedly had a row with her on an airplane that got so heated that fellow business class travellers and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down. In July this year, Ms Oliva was arrested in Brazil after Maradona accused her of stealing watches and jewellery worth nearly £250,000 from his mansion in Dubai.","Diego Maradona serenaded his on-off girlfriend Rocio Oliva in Dubai .

"A 19-year-old college student suspected of murdering his parents and attempting to shoot dead two of his younger siblings had planned the attack over a 'long period of time', prosecutors said Monday. Ashton Sachs appeared in court for the first time to face charges of murder after his parents Andra, 54, and Bradford Sachs, 57, were found shot in their sleep at their 3.5million home in San Juan Capistrano, California. Prosecutors allege that Sachs set out to kill everyone inside the 9,000-square-foot mansion, down to his 8-year-old adopted little brother. Killer son: Ashton Sachs was arrested last week on suspicion of shooting his parents Bradford and Andra Sachs in their sleep on February 9 . Charges: Sachs could face the death penalty if convicted of murdering his parents (Bradford on the left, Andra on the right). He is also facing charges for the attempted murder of his siblings . Someone had a key: There was no sign of forced entry at the family's $3.5million home in San Juan Capistrano the night of the attack . Sachs is also facing two counts of attempted murder for shooting at his younger brother and sister, paralyzing the boy and missing the 17-year-old girl. Sachs has another teenage sister who was also uninjured in the attack. 'This was not something that happened at the spur of the moment or in the heat of passion,' prosecutor Ebrahim Baytieh said. 'This is a horrendous crime involving an adult man who decided to murder and kill the people who loved him the most, and the people who were supporting him,' Baytieh added. At the time of the murders, Sachs had moved out of the family home to Seattle, Washington where he was attending school. Tension? Sachs had moved out of the family home and had been living in Seattle attending college. Pictured above on his Facebook profile . Sachs drove the 1,200 miles from his home in Seattle to Southern California and snuck into the family home sometime after midnight on February 9. He first shot dead his parents while their were sleeping in their bed with a firearm he purchased himself. From there, Sachs targeted his younger siblings. He shot and hit his 8-year-old brother and missed hitting his 17-year-old sister before fleeing the property and taking a flight back to Seattle. Baytieh wouldn't elaborate on a motive for the crime, but did say money wasn't a factor - though his parents were quite wealthy. The couple (both pictured on the right) separated in 1999, but continued living and running several businesses together . 'I don’t have any indication whatsoever that his parents were anything other than supporting parents who cared about their children, all of their children — who supported their children, all of their children,' Baytieh said. Sachs wasn't arrested until March 6, since neither of his siblings could identify the shooter. Authorities first investigated whether one of the Sachs' many business connections was responsible, since they found several people who 'did not like' the couple. The investigation narrowed in on Ashton Sachs when he filed for guardianship of his younger siblings along with older brother Myles, who was away at school during the attack. New parents: A few weeks after their parents' murders, Ashton filed for guardianship of his three younger siblings along with older brother Myles, who was away at school at the time of the shootings. The brothers are pictured together in Ashton's Facebook profile picture on the left, while Myles is pictured by himself on the right . In court on Monday, the judge delayed Sachs' arraignment until April 4. Until then, he will be held without bond at the Central Men's Jail in Orange County. If convicted, Sachs could face the death penalty. The Sachs divorced nearly 15 years ago, but continued to live and raise their five children together, despite a separation marked with restraining orders and hostility. Following their divorce, which had been characterized by Andra Sachs as a 'financial decision,' according to a friend, the couple adopted a boy and girl from Russia. Neighbors were shocked by the brutal killings of the seemingly pleasant couple, but their business associates and customers described the Sachs as difficult to work with. Legal proceedings and several complaints had allegedly been made about the couple, who ran businesses under several names. In 2011, Ms Sachs appeared on a list of California's top tax evaders, allegedly owing $1.15million to the state. The following year, her name had been removed from the list, and she told Patch at the time: 'The amount due is highly in dispute and contested.' Consumer watchdog website Ripoff Report contained several allegations against the couple over disputed rental agreements and claims that they took advantage of Ms Sachs's dying mother. In a post from July last year, an alleged former tenant claimed they were still waiting for the couple to pay a court order of $8,000 over a deposit dispute.","Ashton Sachs, 19, was arrested last week on suspicion of murdering parents Bradford and Andra Sachs in the early hours of February 9 .

"A Cambridge university lecturer has caused an outcry after footage emerged showing him calling homosexuality an 'inexplicable aberration' and saying gay people are 'so ignorant you don't even understand what your bodies are for'. In a video that has gone viral, Tim Winter, 52, a theology lecturer and Director of Studies at Wolfson College, called homosexuality the 'ultimate inversion', and said homosexual acts were an 'extreme defiance of Allah'. Today the public school-educated academic, a practising Sufi Muslim who also uses the name Sheikh Abdul-Hakim Murad, apologised for his remarks that were made 'at least 15 years ago' before he joined the university, and said his views had changed since. Scroll down for video . 'This is a form of extreme defiance of Allah': Mr Winter ranted against homosexuality for eight minutes in the clip, which he said dated back at least 15 years . The British academic faced fierce criticism over the views he expounded in what he says was a question and answer session following a talk he gave in America in the mid-1990s. Charlie Bell, President of the CUSU . LGBT+ group for lesbian, gay and transgender students, said: 'Remarks degrading LGBT+ people, . relationships or sexual practices surely disgust any of us who are part . of the decades-long struggle to see LGBT+ people as valued, equal . citizens... 'We . know that Mr Winter has asked for the video to be taken down; it . remains for his college to decide whether these past remarks are . incompatible with his current role in the college, especially if it has a . pastoral nature, and we are currently in communication with them over . this.' Gareth Rhys, 23, a finalist studying History of Art at Magdalene College, said the 'hateful, anachronistic views' expressed in the video made him feel 'deeply uncomfortable'. He added: 'I think he should be removed from his position as Director of Studies because his views could cloud his judgement when dealing with gay students and could even put gay people off from applying for his subject for fear of prejudice. 'If the views are out of context then he should explain that context.' Tim Winter is a Director of Studies at Wolfson College, Cambridge, where he meets students regularly to check how they are . The divinity lecturer compared gay people to arsonists, saying just because you are born with a tendency doesn't mean it should be legalised . In the eight-minute rant which is . believed to be taken from his DVD, Al-Ghazali On Disciplining The Soul, . he referred to gay people, saying: 'You're an ignorant people.  Why ignorant?  Because you don't even understand what your bodies are for. 'How ignorant can you get?  Even the animals know.' VIDEO: Watch the Cambridge lecturer's no-holds-barred rant at homosexuality . Mr Winter, who is rated number 50 on the Muslim 500 . list of the most influential Muslims in the world, discussed at length . the Sharia's (Muslim law's) 'emphatic, unqualified condemnation and . prohibition of all forms of homosexual behaviour'. In the video, which was made when he was in his 30s, Mr Winter . compared gay people to arsonists, arguing that arsonists have a genetic . predisposition to be arsonists, but just because they are born with it . does not mean arson should be made legal. 'That's . no argument for legalising what they do,' he said.  'The claim that a . human being is born with a particular tendency means that it should be . legalised is neither here nor there.' No holds barred: The chairman of Cambridge University's LGBT+ society said he was 'disgusted' by Mr Winter's remarks . He went on to compare gay people to smokers, affirming that practising homosexuality is more dangerous than smoking. 'There is a great war against cigarette smoking but there is no campaign at all against the vice of the people of Lut [ie people of Sodom, or homosexuals]', he said. The lecturer also says that in the eyes of Islam, homosexuality was not a sin, but practising it was. 'Even in the case of those few individuals that do appear to have an incurable tendency towards this inexplicable aberration, if they do not act upon the tendency they are not sinning... 'Acting upon and gratifying the tendency is the sin.' Today Mr Winter, who has apologised to the University and to the Faculty of Divinity, where he teaches, told . MailOnline: 'The YouTube clip is at least 15 years old, and does not in . any way represent my present views. 'I am happy to confirm that I . certainly do not see homosexuals as an ""inexplicable aberration"". The . other views expressed in it should not be taken as indicators of what I . currently believe - we all have our youthful enthusiasms, and we all . move on.' He told The Tab the interview was recorded in America after a talk he had given there in the 1990s. A Cambridge University spokesman said: . 'Mr Winter has apologised for these remarks, recorded nearly twenty . years ago, and has emphasised that he no longer holds these views.'

Former Real Madrid manager Mourinho fell out with his compatriot during his time at the Bernabeu . Ronaldo has assured fans the ice pack on his knee after Portugal's defeat by France was purely precautionary . The record-breaking forward left Real Madrid fans with their hearts in their mouths on Saturday when he immediately applied ice to his troublesome left knee but the measure is now standard practice for Ronaldo designed to prevent any inflammation that might aggravate an on-going but controllable tendinitis problem. Ronaldo spoke before the friendly that Portugal lost to France and repeated his desire to keep winning Ballon d’Or awards. He told Correio da Manha: ‘I am not going to pretend otherwise I would love to win my third Golden Ball. It doesn’t depend on me so I am just going to keep doing the best I can and let’s see what happens in January. ‘I have had a great start to the season and my scoring record is better than ever. I hope it’s going to be a year of great success on a team and individual level.’ Ronaldo, pictured against France on Sunday, has targeted a year of great success for himself and his team . Meanwhile, Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos insisted there is no better player in world football than Ronaldo. The Real frontman has scored an impressive 17 goals in just 11 matches and Germany international Kroos, speaking to Die Welt, said: 'At the moment, there is no better player than Cristiano.

"Jailed: Former Sussex Police sergeant James Bowes arrives at the Old Bailey today where he was sentenced to 10 months behind bars . A former police sergeant has been jailed for 10 months for trying to sell a story about celebrity Katie Price's daughter to the News of the World. James Bowes, 30, contacted the now . defunct Sunday tabloid newspaper and told a journalist that police child . protection officers had gone to the home of Price's former husband . Peter Andre in Brighton. This followed a report that the couple's daughter, Princess Tiaamii, then aged two, had been injured in 2010, the Old Bailey heard. The team found no untoward injuries to the child and the matter was not taken further, the court was told. But Bowes, who worked for in Brighton for Sussex Police, emailed the newspaper asking for money for the information. The story was printed with information from another source and Bowes was never paid. Bowes, 30, from Steyning, West Sussex, pleaded guilty last month to misconduct in public office. The court heard that he passed information to the Sun newspaper about a child who was bitten by a fox and was paid £500. And he passed on details of a psychic who had contacted police about a search for bodies in two former Brighton homes in 2010 of serial killer Peter Tobin, but was not paid. Bowes was charged by officers from Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into police corruption. The former officer, from Steyning, West Sussex, admitted a single count of misconduct in public office at an earlier hearing. Mr Justice Fulford told Bowes: 'You have made available to the press confidential information concerning children. 'Your explanation is that it was a foolish attempt by you to be in some part associated with notorious or high-profile cases.' Bowes had abused his position of trust and undermined the relationship the police had with the public. Jailed police officer: He admitted selling stories about the daughter of Katie Price and Peter Andre . Stephen Wedd, defending, said Bowes had now given £500 to the Crimestoppers charity, and had been dismissed by Sussex Police. Mark Bryant-Heron, prosecuting, told . the court that Bowes had access to the police computer to get . information about the three reports in 2010. Andre and Price had separated and there was a report of injuries to the couple's daughter. 'The child protection team established no untoward injuries,' said Mr Bryant-Heron. The following day Bowes emailed the News of the World news desk but was told that the newspaper already had the information. Jailed: The former sergeant was brought before the courts after being arrested under Operation Elveden which is the Metropolitan Police's probe into corrupt payments to officials . 'Clearly, the News of the World had access to other sources for information,' he added. Bowes had emailed the Sun after a fox . attacked a child at a birthday party and was paid after providing the . contact details of the parents. The father told the court he had to move his family away from their home until the fuss died down after the story was printed.

"Three people have been arrested after dancing on the top of their SUV in the middle of a busy Chicago intersection. The group of two men and one woman was traveling with four small children when they stopped in the intersection between LaSalle and Monroe streets in downtown Chicago on Thursday afternoon around 1:15pm. The 59-year-old man, 36-year-old man and 27-year-old woman then clambered onto the roof along with the children and began to dance to Ellie Goulding's song Lights. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

The footage shows the Chevy Tahoe in the middle of the intersection with all its doors open. Atop its roof are the younger man and woman holding infants as well as the older man and two other small children. The young woman, clad in a crop top and what look like pajama pants and holding a baby, appears to have words with a woman standing on the street.

She waves at the woman and then gestures at her energetically before turning to caress the younger man and continue dancing; the woman on the street gives up and continues walking. 'Ooh that's so not safe,' a woman can be heard saying on the recording as a bus squeezes past the SUV. Other footage captures a different woman exclaiming that one of the babies isn't even wearing socks in the chilly Chicago weather. According to NBC Chicago, the group is from San Tan Valley in Arizona. The three adults were taken into custody and charged with misdemeanour endangerment to a child. The children are now in the care of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.","An SUV stopped between LaSalle and Monroe Streets on Thursday afternoon .

"It was the ambitious dream of a five-year-old cancer patient: to become a real-life superhero. And thousands of Americans – including President Barack Obama – rallied to make it happen, giving Miles Scott an unforgettable day as ‘Batkid’. About 10,000 people flanked the streets of San Francisco, as it  transformed into Gotham City for the day, allowing Miles to defeat Batman’s nemeses The Penguin and The Riddler. Scroll Down for Video . Our hero: Thousands of Americans hailed Batkid as cancer patient Miles Scott lives his dream . The pint-sized superhero sped around in a Batmobile – with a police motorcycle escort and news helicopters circling overhead – as he vanquished crime. Batkid Saves City, screamed the headlines on a special edition of The San Francisco – or rather Gotham City – Chronicle. And President Obama sent a taped message from the White House saying: ‘Way to go, Miles. Way to save Gotham!’ About 10,000 people flanked the streets of San Francisco, as it  transformed into Gotham City . At the end of the day, Mayor Ed Lee presented Miles with a giant chocolate key to the city as a huge, cheering crowd gathered outside City Hall. The massive effort came after Miles’s mother Natalie, from Oregon, wrote to the Make-A-Wish Foundation saying her ailing son dreamed of being a mini crimefighter. And the youngster thought he was visiting San Francisco to pick up a Batman costume when the action started happening on Friday. Police Chief Greg Suhr, who recorded mayday messages to set Batkid on his missions, said: ‘This is one of those days which makes me so proud. ‘It has turned into a full-blown phenomenon. ‘Everyone joined together to make this young boy’s dream come true.’ President Barack Obama sent a message to Miles (left), saying: 'Way to go, Miles. Way to save Gotham!' Among those joining in was the US Attorney’s Office, which issued a formal ‘indictment’ against the Riddler and Penguin ‘for their all too familiar villainous ways in Gotham City’ adding: ‘Somehow they thought these latest stunts would go undetected by Batkid.’ Miles’s mother Natalie said: ‘It was a day he will remember forever. People were lining the streets. I have been in tears from the outpouring of love, kindness and humanity that has been shown to my son.’ In real life, Miles has defeated an enemy more deadly than any supervillain. He has been fighting leukaemia since he was 18 months old, but he underwent his final surgery last month, and the cancer is now in remission. ‘This day has meant an end to over three years of putting toxic drugs in our son’s body,’ Mrs Scott added. ‘He is our superhero.’ Eric Johnson, who accompanied Miles dressed as Batman, said: ‘He’s an excellent superhero. He’s a totally mild-mannered kid when the mask is off. But when he puts on the Batsuit he’s uncontainable.’","Around 10,000 people flanked the streets of San Francisco, as it transformed into Gotham City for the day .

"Another world record toppled to Britain today when a seaside town scooped the official Guinness title for building the most sandcastles on a beach in an hour. Ireland was the loser as its feat last year of constructing 571 castles was crushed by the North Yorkshire resort of Scarborough which turned out 683. An estimated 400 people turned up at the seaside town's South Bay to begin the attempt at 11am. There was cheering when it was announced shortly after noon that they had dug their way into the record books. A young child runs out from the sandcastles built on Scarborough's South Bay beach in an attempt to break the Guinness World Record . Over 1,000 sandcastles, measuring 2ft high and 2ft wide, with a turret on top, had to be constructed within one hour for the Guinness World Record to be broken . Awarding the certificate to organisers from Yorkshire Water, Guinness World Record Adjudicator Anne-Leise Rouse said 'This is amazing. 'It is a really great achievement to break the world record by more than 100. 'People think it's easy but it isn't. But we had perfect weather conditions - not too windy and moist sand.' The rules state each sand castle had to be 2ft tall with a 2ft wide base and include four turrets which did not crumble. Ms Rouse added: 'It is really difficult. But if it had been sunnier it might have been windier and we would have had more damage castles.' The original record was set in France in 2007 at 520 castles. Guinness say the current holder was Ireland - set as the Duncannon Sand sculpting Festival in Duncannon. But that crumbled yesterday as the Yorkshire families worked like demons, many producing more than one castle.

When the order came to stop digging the castle stood in rows 11 deep, covering an area of the sands 125m long and 30m deep. One of the last castles was built by 11-year-old Matthew Moore and his 65-year-old granddad Horace Price, both from Wakefield. Mr Price, a retired highways engineer, said: ""I am all in favour of anything which gets kids out the house and gets some fresh air into their lungs and some exercise. 'Kids spend too much time sitting at home these days watching TV and playing computer games.'Grandmother Radine Price, 60, added: ""It shows children still like to be children.' Matthew said: ""We got here just before the deadline and built ours in five minutes flat. 'All my friends like to go abroad for holidays to places like France but I like the British seaside.'

"A single father, his two young sons and one of their friends have perished in a small plane crash, leaving their town of just 200 people in south Canada in shock. Darren Spence, an experienced crop duster pilot, took off from Waskada, Manitoba with his  sons Gage, 10, and Logan, nine, and nine-year-old Dawson Pentecost, at 1 p.m. on Sunday but crashed into a farmer's field shortly afterwards. They had taken the afternoon trip as Dawson had never been on a plane before, his family said. Loss: Ten-year-old Gage SPence and his brother Logan, 9, died in a plane crash with their father and a friend . Spence, 37, piled the children into his six-seater Cessna 210 at a private airstrip near Waskada around 1 p.m. and Pentecost's older brother waved them off, he said. The plane was headed 70 miles northeast to Brandon, but at 6 p.m., it was reported overdue. At 6.35 p.m., a Canadian Forces search and rescue team found the crashed plane in a farmer's field three miles from the private airstrip, and the pilot and his passengers were dead at the scene. Spence, a single father who owned three planes, also had a young daughter, who was not on the doomed aircraft. Victims: Their father Darren Spence, 37, was piloting the plane that also killed Dawson Pentecost, right . Family: Mr Spence, a crop duster pilot, was a single father and leaves behind a young daughter, pictured . 'As far as I know, (Spence) was taking the kids up for a recreational flight,' Waskada Mayor Garry Williams told the Toronto Sun as he choked back tears. 'That would not have been unusual.' He remembered the boys as 'little guys you see walking by your house every day, riding their bikes, playing hockey, just being kids' and called their deaths 'devastating'. Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the . Transportation Safety Board continue to investigate the cause of the . crash, and said it could take months to reach a conclusion. 'We're going to interview people…that know something about this flight,' Peter Hildebrand from the TSB told CTV News. 'We're going to have to look at the airplane itself. Was the aircraft . serviceable? Was it working? Was there any malfunction that might have . contributed to this?' Active: The Spence boys loved going in their father's planes and both played on the town's hockey team . Happy boys: They had taken the flight on Sunday as their friend, Dawson, had never been in a plane before . Investigators are also looking at . whether the weather was involved. Hildebrand said there were low clouds, . some fog and snow as the plane took off, and ice could have been on the . plane. He said that investigation teams were working through the wreckage, which was spread over a large area. Close friend Terry Linto added to the National Post: 'There's no question. It's not pilot error. It’s got to be mechanical', stressing that Spence always put safety first. Waskada, a community of about 200 . people, is located about 330 kilometers southwest of Winnipeg and just . 10 miles north of the border of North Dakota. Scene: Investigators continue to work on the crash site, which was just a couple of miles from the runway . Probe: One of Spence's three planes.

"Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has demanded his team-mates show ‘personality’ to prevent their Champions League disaster against CSKA Moscow turning into a full-blown crisis. Kompany watched in near disbelief as City had Fernandinho and Yaya Toure sent off in an embarrassing 2-1 defeat at an eerily quiet Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night. Once again, they gave a performance in Europe that was a far cry from their domestic form. City are bottom of Group E and need maximum points from their remaining fixtures against Bayern Munich and Roma to stand any realistic chance of qualifying for the knockout stages. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Vincent Kompany looks dejected after Manchester City's shock defeat to CSKA Moscow . Kompany has demanded his team-mates show 'personality' to avoid a Champions League disaster . ‘Everyone will jump on the bandwagon, but I am going to go the other way and say I still believe in my team, and still back everyone at this club 100 per cent to turn it around,’ said Kompany. ‘But personality will have to show in the next games, otherwise we will have to wait another year.’ Unfortunately for City, a number of factors suggests just such a wait lies in store. Manuel in a muddle . Manager Manuel Pellegrini was dignified post-match, refusing to blame referee Tasos Sidiropoulos for his team’s poor result. The Chilean knows City’s failings went beyond one hapless official and tactically he must accept blame. Allowing his team to be overrun in midfield was naive given that one key central player, Toure, is already a loose cannon when it comes to holding position and tracking back. Manuel Pellegrini must shoulder blame after City were stunned by their Russian opponents . The plans against CSKA were a mess. Fernando was expected to stop Moscow’s counter-attacks almost single-handedly while Stevan Jovetic, Jesus Navas and Toure ineffectually stood by. He sent on Fernandinho at half-time to rectify the problem but then gambled by taking Fernando off for Edin Dzeko — again leaving only one natural holder. Fernandinho’s red card compounded the error. Toure in turmoil . For so long an idol, Toure has developed into a caricature of a sulky footballer this season. Already booked, his pointless shove on Roman Eremenko in the second half saw him get a straight red card and follow Fernandinho down the tunnel. It killed any City prospects of salvaging a draw. At least the Ivorian had the self-awareness to apologise. There are mitigating factors. His younger brother died of cancer during the World Cup and the racial abuse he has received on Twitter is disturbing and unpleasant. Yaya Toure saw red for a shove on CSKA's Roman Eremenko to end hope of a fightback . Yet in this kind of form he is a liability. His lack of positional discipline and desire to track back made the job for central midfield partner Fernando impossible. We never really got to the bottom of the birthday cake debacle, when Toure was allegedly seething that City’s Abu Dhabi owners hadn’t marked his birthday with due respect. The suspicion is that he was trying to engineer a move back to Barcelona. When Barca failed to show much interest, he pledged his loyalty to City rather unconvincingly. Fans turning off . When City were struggling in the third tier of English football, their supporters were known as the best in the country. But now they are among Europe’s elite, there is a strange lethargy about big nights at the Etihad compared to Old Trafford or Anfield. After seeing 10,000 seats go unused for their previous home game against Roma, City allowed fans to buy two-for-one against CSKA. It swelled the attendance but not the passion or atmosphere.The first half was observed in near silence until the team were jeered off at the interval when they were 2-1 down. Gael Clichy endured a nightmare against Moscow as City's Champions League hopes were left in tatters . Clichy conundrum . Gael Clichy joined City from Arsenal, presumably for much higher wages. But some of his defending against CSKA was distracted to the point of being ridiculous. He conceded the free-kick that allowed Seydou Doumbia to head the opener for CSKA. Even worse, after Toure had equalised, Clichy hacked a simple pass across his own half straight to an opponent. Three touches later, Doumbia had restored Moscow’s lead. Executive stress . They can’t avoid some degree of responsibility, from Sheik Mansour down. Their historic breaking of Financial Fair Play regulations means Pellegrini has been forced to pick a reduced squad for the Champions League. Alvaro Negredo and John Guidetti have been loaned out because there is no room for them, leaving Pellegrini having to chase four trophies with just three strikers. Pellegrini has been left short in attack after Alvaro Negredo was loaned out to Valencia . He has said Angel di Maria and Falcao were never options because City couldn’t afford the transfer fees or wages under the FFP restrictions. The UEFA effect . Europe’s governing body might deny it but their rules have made it far more difficult for Manchester City to compete. For City to be seeded lower than Arsenal, and therefore given a harder Champions League group, is ridiculous given that they won the Premier League and Arsenal finished fourth. Their fans were banned from the away game in Moscow while CSKA supporters seemed to sneak in. ... on the bright side . City have been here before in both title-winning seasons. They were written off at stages in the season but dug in when nobody else believed and came out on top.With Bayern through, second spot is still up for grabs. Victory against the Germans would set up a likely winner-takes-all meeting away to Roma.

"A mystery small 'hot spot' in the U.S. Southwest is responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States. The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles (6,500 square kilometers), or half the size of Connecticut. Yet a new Nasa map show is produces more than triple the standard ground-based estimate. The Four Corners area (red) is the major U.S. hot spot for methane emissions in this map showing how much emissions varied from average background concentrations from 2003-2009 (dark colors are lower than average; lighter colors are higher). The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles. Methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Like carbon dioxide, it contributes to global warming. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. In each of the seven years studied from 2003-2009, the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. This is almost 3.5 times the estimate for the same area in the European Union's widely used Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. In the study published online today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers used observations made by the European Space Agency's Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument, which measured greenhouse gases from 2002 to 2012. The atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period. A ground station in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network, operated by the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, provided independent validation of the measurement. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Is this the cause? The Four Corners coal-fired power plant, near Farmington, is one of the targets Nasa wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane . Research scientist Christian Frankenberg of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, first noticed the Four Corners signal years ago in SCIAMACHY data. 'We didn't focus on it because we weren't sure if it was a true signal or an instrument error,' Frankenberg said. The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country. Natural gas is 95-98 percent methane. Methane is colorless and odorless, making leaks hard to detect without scientific instruments. 'The results are indicative that emissions from established fossil fuel harvesting techniques are greater than inventoried,' Kort said. 'There's been so much attention on high-volume hydraulic fracturing, but we need to consider the industry as a whole.' In just one place in the United States do four states meet. The borders of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona intersect at Four Corners, west of the confluence of the Mancos and San Juan Rivers. Coalbed methane is gas that lines pores and cracks within coal. In underground coal mines, it is a deadly hazard that causes fatal explosions almost every year as it seeps out of the rock. After the U.S. energy crisis of the 1970s, techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel. By 2012, coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the United States. Frankenberg noted that the study demonstrates the unique role space-based measurements can play in monitoring greenhouse gases. 'Satellite data cannot be as accurate as ground-based estimates, but from space, there are no hiding places,' Frankenberg said. In March 2014 the Obama Administration announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions under its Climate Action Plan. The strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emissions and assessing current methane emissions data.","Small 'hot spot' responsible for producing the largest concentration of the greenhouse gas methane seen over the United States .

"Rickie Lambert is expected to come up against a defender who once cheered him from the stands at Southampton when Liverpool face Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup. Baily Cargill had a season ticket at St Mary’s and celebrated on the pitch after Lambert helped secure his club promotion to the Premier League with a 4-0 win over Coventry in April 2012. The 19-year-old, on Southampton’s books between 2006-08, is aiming to inflict misery on his hero at Goldsands Stadium however, in a quarter-final tie that is shaping up to be huge for Brendan Rodgers. Baily Cargill (left) had a season ticket at Southampton and celebrated on the pitch when the club won promotion to the Premier League in 2012 . Cargill could come up against Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana, whom he used to cheer from the stands . The 19-year-old defender (left) has played every minute of Bournemouth's league cup run . Cargill is yet to feature in the Championship, but has played every minute of Bournemouth’s League Cup run so far and is hoping for the chance to test himself against Lambert and fellow ex-Saint Adam Lallana. ‘When I was a scholar I’d go to every home game and I watched Southampton get promoted to the Premier League. I was on the pitch that day,’ he says. ‘My family are all mad Saints fans too, especially my little brother. They’ll enjoy watching me if I play against the likes of Lambert and Lallana.’ He adds: ‘It’s a big match for them and a big match for us. It’s probably come at a good time because we’re on a good run of form – we haven’t lost in 12 games – and Liverpool obviously aren’t doing as well as they’d like to be doing. Liverpool need the win and we’d obviously like to win too.’ If manager Eddie Howe does select Cargill, it would represent a remarkable personal progression. Little more than a year ago Cargill was facing Braintree during a loan spell at Welling in the Conference. Rickie Lambert moved to Liverpool in the summer and has endured a difficult start to life on Merseyside . Lambert (centre) spent five hugely successful seasons at Southampton between 2009-14 . Rather than stick to Under 21 football, he elected to mature among the gnarled battlegrounds of non-League. ‘Experiencing that side of the game was definitely a massive help in my development,’ he says. ‘It will stand me in good stead for the rest of my career. ‘We played Braintree away in only my second game and they had a striker called Jordan Cox. They played a lot of long balls and in that game I went up for at least 20 headers – that was a tough physical battle. There were a few arms flying about. ‘I’ve come a long way since then and definitely got better as a player. If you had told me when I was playing Braintree away that I’d have a chance of facing Liverpool the following season I’d never have believed you.’ Eddie Howe's  Bournemouth take on Liverpool on Wednesday for a place in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Adam Lallana joined Lambert in making the move from St Mary's to Anfield in the summer . Impressive performances against Exeter, Northampton, and Cardiff – with three clean sheets – preceded a 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion in the last round as Victor Anichebe, Brown Ideye and Saido Berahino all failed to score. That earned Cargill a call-up to Aidy Bothroyd’s England Under 20 side for the match against Canada in November – and he scored a powerful header in the 2-2 draw. Manchester United striker James Wilson featured in that youth international and was selected by Louis Van Gaal to start up front against Liverpool on Sunday. ‘I like seeing other lads my age do well, because it makes you realise as long as you get an opportunity and take it then you should play,’ Cargill says. ‘The gaffer is terrific. The training sessions are always really good and with him being a centre-half he can give me tips.

"The hospital trust accused of a cover-up over cancer treatment has the worst waiting times figures in the country, it has emerged. Police are probing Colchester Hospital University over claims staff concealed how long it took to treat sufferers. Since details of the scandal emerged last month, it has gone from being officially one of the best for cancer waiting times to the worst, and could be fined tens of thousands of pounds. Only 93 per cent of patients were treated within 31 days of being seen by a doctor at the trust's hospital in Colchester . National targets say at least 95 per cent of cancer patients should be treated within 31 days of a doctor deciding the most suitable option. But at Colchester just 93 per cent of patients were treated in this time frame meaning 22 were made to wait longer in the last three months alone. And before the probe was launched the trust claimed 98 per cent had treatment within this time putting it amongst the top 30 in the country. The trust is now expected to be fined by the NHS regional body - North Essex Clinical Commissioning Group - which could be in the region of tens of thousands of pounds. Meanwhile the trust’s £165,000-a-year chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts has again refused to resign insisting he was spearheading a culture of openness. Dr Gordon Coutts, Chief Executive of the hospital, has again refused to resign . Speaking yesterday, he added: ‘I do my very best to live up to those values - to be open, to be available and to be visible around the trust. ‘We have to create a culture where people can speak up. It takes a lot of courage. ‘We need to be better at listening to concerns and encouraging people to raise them.’ If Essex Police find enough evidence of criminal wrongdoing, staff could face jail. The probe was launched after whistleblowers told the Care Quality Commission they were being bullied by senior managers to change waiting times figures. Some patients were being made to wait four months for life-saving treatment and the hospital faced being heavily fined for missing these targets. And former staff at the trust have told how Dr Coutts made their life hell and presided over a culture obsessed with meeting targets. His personal assistant Mandy Tapfield is said to have recently quit after 28 years at the hospital, claiming her ‘life was made hell’. The 56-year-old, who was his executive PA until last month, claims she left because she could no longer tolerate Dr Coutts’s demands.","Colchester Hospital University is being probed by Essex police .

"Labour's plans for a mansion tax have been attacked by critics who say middle class families and pensioners will be hit in the pocket more than the super-rich who are the intended target. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told the party’s conference in Manchester that the measure would only hit houses worth more than £2million. But with property prices having shot up in the past decade, families who moved into relatively affordable homes could suddenly face huge tax bills because their home has increased in value – even if their income has not. According to figures from the Halifax House Price Index, a property in Greater London bought for£500,000 in 1994, would now, 20 years later, be worth £2,056,381 - a rise of more than 311 per cent. And according to the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, almost one third of properties worth more than £2million have been owned by the same people for more than a decade, and around a sixth for more than 20 years. Greg Hands, Conservative MP for Chelsea and Fulham, today told MailOnline a mansion tax would be more accurately described as a 'homes tax'. Scroll down for video . In Stoke Newington this five-bedroom semi-detached home would set buyers back £2million. A neighbouring home which sold for £750,000 in 2006 is now estimated to be worth £2,396,310. If property values continue to grow at the rate seen over the last ten years, homes now worth £1.2million would cross the £2million threshold by 2023. In Islington a four-bedroom terraced property was on sale for £2,000,000. A similar house on the same street sold for £430,000 in 1999, and is now estimated to be worth £2,036,764.  Conservative MP Greg Hands said: 'Elderly people would find it impossible to pay amounts of up to £30,000 per annum to live in their family home which in many cases they have been in for 30 years or more.' In Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, a Victorian five-bed home, spread over three floors and close to Richmond Park, was on the market for £2,200,000. The idea of a mansion tax has been pushed by Liberal Democrat MP and Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills Vince Cable, who proposed that any home worth more than £2million would be taxed at an annual rate of one per cent of its value above that threshold. In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value. A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. There are also fears that, if the tax is introduced, the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting Government revenue. In Teddington, Middlesex, this four-bedroom detached home is on sale for £2,100,000. Property agents Knight Frank have also estimated that the majority of the homes affected by a potential mansion tax are located in the south east and London, meaning homeowners in the region would be subsidising services across the country.A spokesman said: 'There are approximately 110,000 £2million properties in the UK, 86.4per cent of which are located in London and the south east of England. Assuming Labour forecasts are accurate, residents in these two English regions will be responsible for an additional £1.04bn in tax funding for the UK's NHS service.' Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million. Mr Balls's home in the more modest Stamford Hill area of Hackney, East London, which he shares with wife and fellow MP Yvette Cooper and their three children, is thought to be worth around £650,000. A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry. Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax. A recently-built home in sought-after Alderley Edge in Cheshire is on the market priced at £2million. Lucian Cook, director of residential research at Savills, said the effect would be unknown until Labour confirmed the percentage of tax charged. He said: 'Prices have risen by 530per cent in London, but in the rest of the country it's gone up by 200per cent and that market has disproportionately performed. For just under the £2million threshold, a six-bedroom Victorian villa in the highly-desirable Morningside area of Edinburgh is taking offers of around £1.95million. Sales of the country's most expensive homes, around 1.6per cent of the total market, already provide 26per cent of all stamp duty land tax, and the top 0.7per cent contributes 36per cent of the amount received in inheritance tax on homes. In Glasgow, a four-storey home, built for Saracen Foundry founder Walter MacFarlane is listed as being open to offers of more than £2,000,000. As well as being suitable for a private home, the building is also described as being suitable for an art gallery or a library. The value of the property dwarfs that of surrounding homes, which have an average sale price of £485,640, but this has risen by £20,480 in the last five years. Just outside Glasgow, a four-bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £2,100,000. The property, which was completely rebuilt in 1999, boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design. Other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year. Looking out onto the highly sought-after Sandbanks Penninsula in Dorset, this four bedroom property is on sale for £2,175,000. The area is popular with many wealthy celebrities, and homes regularly sell for more than £2million, with average prices rising by 13.6 per cent in the last five years. A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost. This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966.

"A Kansas community saw its suburban peace of mind slip completely away over the weekend after  two popular high school girls soccer teammates killed themselves within two days of each other. Ciara Webb, 16, was found dead in her Olathe home Friday afternoon after taking her own life via an as yet unrevealed method. Students at Olathe Northwest High who didn't already know of the tragedy were horrified to hear the news Monday morning. During the following school period, officials dropped another bomb: Cady Housh, also a junior, had thrown herself in front of a train two days after learning of her friend Ciara's suicide. Scroll down for video . Shocked community: Olathe, Kansas high school juniors and soccer teammates Cady Housh (right) and Ciara Webb (left) committed suicide within just two days of each other over the weekend . Sad: Cady Housh tweeted this ominous message on Sunday, the very day she decided she, too, would end her own life . On Sunday, presumably just before her decision to step in front of a barreling locomotive in Lenexa, Kansas around 8pm, Cady posted what would be her final message to the world. 'Worst weekend of my f***ing life,' the teen wrote. She would then retweet a message of hope that a friend had posted, one that urged the mourning 'to hold on.' However, the emotional young woman would not be able to do so herself. In the first period class at Olathe Northwest, the school's 1,700 students were informed of Webb's untimely death. Already, Webb's close friends and teammates on the Ravens girl's soccer team had posted notes of grief, confusion and terrible sadness on social media. Tragic: Housh (left) threw herself in front of a train on Sunday, two days after her soccer teammate Ciara Webb (right) had taken her own life at her Olathe home . Tragedy struck at Olathe Northwest High after, within just two periods at the beginning of their day, students and teachers learned they'd lost two girls, both juniors, to suicide . Many also included photos of Ciara. The 16-year-old blonde--called CiCi by friends--looked like a perfectly well-adjusted teen. Friends began including a hashtag, #ripCW, with their prayers, remembrances and photos. Students would learn the following period that they'd need yet another somber hashtag. 'You dreaded going into the hallways,' ONW high student Katie MacDonald told the Kansas City Star. 'Class was fine, because I'm a freshman. But when you went into the hallways, that's when people that knew (the first victim) were there.' Reports from inside say that some teachers were even seen to burst into tears once the news broke. On Sunday, by which time most if not all of those who were close with Ciara had learned of her death, Cady Housh was seen by a freight train engineer in Lenexa. She was standing on the tracks in the locomotive's path. The engineer summoned authorities but could not stop the train. What could have caused it? Friends of the girls expressed their grief on social media, on the same sites that still show the beautiful, smiling faces of Cady and Ciara (left and right) Mourning: Friends were left stunned by the one-two-punch of the girls' suicides. The hashtag #ripCW cropped up on Twitter and Instagram soon after Ciara's suicide, only to be followed all too soon after Housh's death by the tag #ripCH . Lenexa police and first responders were called to the scene in the Kansas City suburb shortly after 8 p.m. Sunday. The girl was taken to a hospital and later died. Soon, the Olathe Northwest students and other friends of the girls in the area were adding #ripCH to their already wrenching tweets and Instagram photos. Also blonde and with an undeniably charming smile, photos of Cady carry no hint of the deeply gruesome act she'd soon find herself driven to. Cady and Ciara have left their families, their classmates, and their teammates in a state of utter shock. 'This amazing family will forever be missing two very important pieces, we love you guys, rest easy babies #ripCW #ripCH,' tweeted a friend of the girls' Haley Kuehn, who would later write, 'This is a living hell. Dustin Edde, who identifies himself as Ciara's brother on Facebook, posted a heartbreaking message to the late teen on Facebook Saturday. 'Love you so much Cici, wish I could find a time machine if anyone has one let me use it please. RIP little sister,' he wrote. Dear ONW Families: . I wanted to follow up with all of our families related to the tragic information we have had to share with you regarding the suicides of two students here at ONW. First I want to share with you how the events unfolded here at ONW this morning, the action that we took immediately to support our students and staff, and most importantly , I want to leave you with a strong request that you have a very heartfelt conversation with your son or daughter this evening . As you are aware, we opened ONW yesterday to any students in need of support or just needing a place to go and be with friends after learning on Friday evening of the death of Ciara Webb. This morning we met with our staff at 7:30 to brief them on the incident from Friday. They were provided with resources for talking with and supporting students. Qualified counselors, social workers, school psychologists, school resource officers from ONW, other schools/community resources were available for students upon their request or if any adult noticed that a student was struggling. Each student was told in their first hour about the death of Ciara Webb. Devastated parents: Ciara Webb's father Jason Webb (left) posted a touching photo of himself to Facebook after his daughter's suicide, making it his profile picture . After the ONW administration was notified of the death of Cady Housh, we asked that staff share the new information with their second hour class. After that announcement many additional students sought out the support and counsel from our crisis team of qualified personnel. Students were told that they could call their parents. Many parents called to check their students out of school. Care was taken to ensure any student that was leaving campus had a parent with them or they were in direct contact with their parents. Many students have remained here at school, with classes continuing as planned and with staff and resources available to them throughout the day. We are in constant communication with those on the band trip in New York. Please know care and support is being provided to them as well! Here is my request for all parents for this afternoon or evening - please have a heartfelt conversation with your student about these tragedies and specifically about suicide. Have this conversation with your son or daughter tonight – you know them best. Ask them how they are feeling, be non-judgmental, and avoid any gossip related to details of the deaths or causes. Keep communication open and maintain high supervision and knowledge of their whereabouts. It will be vital that you are closely monitoring your student's social media accounts for messages being sent and received. Include in your conversations tonight these messages: . - Suicide is a horrible decision and is not an option. - There is nothing they could have done or said to change the outcome of these tragic deaths. - Emphasize that suicide is not the way to handle problems, no matter how big or how painful. - Help is available. Talk to a parent, a teacher, any trusted adult. - If they know of a friend that is struggling, let an adult know as soon as possible. ONW is here to support our students and our families in any way needed. Please do not hesitate to reach out to any of the administrators or staff. School will be in session tomorrow. ONW is a safe place for them to be – surrounded and supported by their teachers and friends that care deeply for each of them. Counseling and support will continue to be available for any students in need throughout the week. Again, please do not hesitate to call or email with any questions or concerns. We are one Raven Family! Gwen Poss, Principal . SOURCE: KCTV .","Ciara Webb took her own life in her Olathe, Kansas home on Friday .

"Chinatown is the bustling heart of downtown Manhattan and with an estimated population of 100,000 literally piled on top of each other in century old tenements, it is also the most crowded. Bordered by the every-shrinking Little Italy and the fabulously wealthy Tribeca and SoHo neighborhoods, Chinatown is a throwback to the cramped, wilder days of New York City at the turn of the 20th century. Rootless members of the Chinese diaspora make their way to the Big Apple to find work in the bustling metropolis, but with little money, no job protection and no guaranteed income, the invisible workforce finds accommodation where they can. Cramped: One of the last lodging houses in New York City, 81 Bowery was home for a generation of immigrant Chinese laborers who work at construction sites and kitchens in Chinatown. Last March, dozens of individuals sharing the fourth-floor - each occupying a 64-square-foot cubicle - were evicted . Photographer Annie Ling has spent the past four years documenting the different aspects of life in Chinatown, observing family life and those less fortunate who struggle inside rent-regulated Single Room Occupancy (SRO) buildings such as the legendary 81 Bowery. Cramped into one floor on one building on the infamous Manhattan thoroughfare photographer Jacob Riis called the 'great democratic highway of the city', 81 Bowery provided Ling with a glimpse of the reality of life in Chinatown. Before it was dramatically shut-down in a flurry of controversy in March 2013, the SROs of 81 Bowery provided cubicles on average 64 square foot from $200 a month, or $9 a month - cash in hand. Cramped family meal time: Workers share a late supper together in cubicle #4 . Searing New York heat: Often on hot summer nights, residents relaxed and took naps on the fire escape to cool down . Exit is that way: The residents found themselves evicted on one night by the City of New York in March 2013 . There, like a modern-day Riis, Ling found dozens of people, mostly immigrants, aged anywhere from 18 to 88-years-old, crammed into small rooms, sharing bathrooms. However, for the proud people who called it home, there was no shame. Indeed, some had lived there and other such SRO buildings in Chinatown for nearly three decades. They would cook together, watch Chinese opera on television together and lend money to each other in support of their attempt at the American Dream. Annie Ling's project is entitled 'A Floating Population' and went on display as part of an exhibition that explores, 'the connection between people and lived spaces within this neighborhood' at The Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) in New York. Communal: Chen Yin Zhen prepares to turn in for the night. Because the cubicles were without their own ceilings, there was very little privacy at the lodge . Mr. Chu, an immigrant laborer from China, once lived in cubicle #4 in 81 Bowery. Like many immigrant laborers, he lives on very little and sends most of his earnings back to his wife and children back in China . The March eviction was not popular in the city, especially when it was revealed the complaint that sparked it came from someone in Arizona, after they watched  CNN piece on 81 Bowery. Resident, Chen Xiukang, 62, was despondent on losing his home. 'We were like a family,' said Chen Xiukang, 62, a cook at a Chinese restaurant to The New York Times. 'We help each other. We rely on one another.' In the aftermath, the city tried to help those who could prove legal documents that they were residents help in the form of temporary housing. Simple: The hallways on the fourth floor of 81 Bowery was a place where its residents shared stories, dried their laundry and played card games . Sad: Some of the elderly who resided at 81 Bowery, have no options. They live there, because it¿s what they can afford . The others were left to ask friends and relatives for help. The Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV), is still trying to rehome some of those turfed-out and briefly led a campaign to reopen 81 Bowery, which ultimately failed. Asked why a housing situation that would seem unpalatable to most New Yorkers is being so fiercely fought over, Ling said that for some, it is all they have. 'They struggle to operate outside of Chinatown because of language and cultural barriers,' she says. Indeed, for Ling, this project is personal. Her Chinatown tenement burned down in 2008, leaving her homeless for a year and her photographs have helped illuminate an oft-ignored situation.","Four-year photographic project reveals the abject poverty that some in Manhattan's famous Chinatown live in .

"Daniel Levy's massive restructuring programme at Tottenham has started with an attempt to bring in Southampton’s head of recruitment Paul Mitchell. The Spurs chairman, furious with the team’s attitude in the club’s 2-1 defeat by Stoke at White Hart Lane on Sunday, has made it known there will be major changes of personnel in the coming weeks. Mauricio Pochettino worked with Mitchell, very much man of the moment after his remarkable success recruiting players for Southampton, at St Mary’s last season. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Premier League Big Match Stats: Tottenham vs Stoke . Daniel Levy begins his Spurs restructuring by trying to lure Southampton's head of recruitment Paul Mitchell . Mitchell has worked wonders while down at St Mary's and impressed many onlookers . Mauricio Pochettino worked under Mitchell during his spell in charge of Southampton . Mitchell - pictured left playing for Wigan in 2003 - has been credited for Southampton's shrewd signings . Steffan Freund was a coach at Spurs but became sidelined at the start of his second season . Pochettino, who admitted he was under massive pressure to change the culture at the club after Sunday’s defeat, is in favour of the move for Mitchell. The Southampton manager worked with him at St Mary’s last season and has made it known to Levy that he trusts Mitchell’s judgement of players. Mitchell is very much the eyes and ears at Southampton and he is largely credited behind the scenes at the club for their hugely successful recruitment policy. Southampton are second in the Barclays Premier League after an extraordinary start to the season under new coach Ronald Koeman. They will fight to keep Mitchell, a former professional player with Wigan and MK Dons, on the south coast despite Tottenham’s advances. Mitchell, 33, travels the world for Southampton and is credited with the majority of incoming transfers since his arrival at the club two years ago. Levy is determined to shake up Tottenham’s backroom team and has already started to make changes following the club’s poor start to the season. Former Spurs midfielder Steffen Freund has now been shifted to his third position at White Hart Lane in less than a year. Freund, who was headhunted from a good job at the German football federation, was a coach under Andre Villas-Boas, but was sidelined at the start of his second season at Spurs. He was eventually given another coaching role, but is now in the position of club ambassador after Pochettino made it known he wanted to work with his own coaching staff. Freund was sent to China two weeks ago as part of a marketing exercise and has only just returned to London. Tottenham were beaten by Stoke City at the weekend (Bojan pictured celebrating after scoring the opener) The existing scouting system at White Hart Lane is set to be shaken up by Levy after poor recruitment . Levy is pressing ahead with other major changes at the club and determined to shake up their existing scouting network. Spurs have fallen behind the top teams in Europe because they do not have enough scouting staff out on the road watching matches before statistics appear on the widely used Scout7 and WyScout computer systems. Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal have scouts based around the world and they are identifying talent long before they appear on the computer system used by most Premier League teams. That has given them a competitive advantage over Tottenham, but Levy is determined to put things right at White Hart Lane.","Paul Mitchell worked with Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton .

"UEFA are looking at staging mini-tournaments involving the continent’s leading clubs outside Europe during pre-season, with the United States the most likely location. European football’s ruling body have been considering ways of increasing global interest in sponsorship and media rights, and elevating games that already involve their marquee teams by giving them UEFA branding and organisation is the preferred option. Planning for this initiative started two years ago, when UEFA examined staging the qualifying rounds for the Champions League and Europa League outside Europe within a knockout tournament format. UEFA are considering hosting mini tournaments outside Europe in the hope they will increase global revenue . Though that ambitious blueprint could be revisited in future, it was felt taking so many competitive fixtures out of Europe was fraught with difficulties. Nevertheless, countries in Asia and the Middle East, as well as America, will welcome the current UEFA thinking. UEFA president Michel Platini played the biggest role in persuading David Gill to stand for the British vice-presidency seat on FIFA’s executive committee. Manchester United director Gill had long been considered the obvious replacement when Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce stands down in 2015. But he made it clear he was not prepared to be part of a FIFA regime led by Sepp Blatter, which led to the FA to even consider putting forward a current player in Rio Ferdinand for the British VP election. However, the persuasive Platini, backed up by FA chairman Greg Dyke, have changed Gill’s mind, with Platini saying he wanted influential Euro voices on FIFA rather than ‘sheep’ just following Blatter’s lead. Michel Platini played the biggest role in persuading David Gill to stand for the British vice-presidency . Lord Coe has ‘big problems’ with American drugs cheat Justin Gatlin being nominated as one of the IAAF athletes of the year. Coe’s manifesto when he stands for the IAAF presidency next year, probably against Ukraine’s Sergey Bubka, is expected to have zero tolerance towards double doping offenders such as Gatlin. Amateur Swimming Association chairman Edward Lord was axed from the FA’s inclusion advisory board with indecent speed after breaking ranks to criticise the lack of action on discriminatory issues. But while the FA sit on their hands on this subject, the good Lord continues to speak out. He used the Liberal Democrats’ conference as a platform to complain about football quartet Richard Scudamore, David Elleray, Terry Robinson and Malky Mackay not facing charges for a variety of discrimination-related comments. IAAF vice-president Seb Coe has questioned Justin Gatlin's nomination for the IAAF Athlete of the year . KAISER DUCKS QUESTION . The difficulties in discovering what really went on in the flawed elections for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was highlighted by Franz Beckenbauer’s bizarre appearance at the Qatar-funded Securing Sport conference. First ‘The Kaiser’ was only asked about his football career by moderator David Walsh, despite it being a summit about sports corruption. Then former FIFA ExCo member Beckenbauer was ultra evasive when asked by the media about who got his vote for 2018 and 2022 and why he didn’t co-operate with the Garcia World Cup inquiry — which he wants published — until he was banned from football for 90 days. The Tesco store responsible for displaying Roy Keane’s book three days early was the Leyland branch near Chorley.

Madcap Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has fallen out with senior player Stephen Warnock, who was dropped for the past two games. And Warnock, in a stormy confrontation, accused Cellino of picking the team and is planning to take his complaint to the PFA. The shock appointment of IMG’s TV rights specialist Tom Harrison as chief executive of the ECB doesn’t necessarily mean vice-chairman Colin Graves, who favoured an outside choice, has won a power struggle with chairman Giles Clarke, who worked with hot favourite Richard Gould at Somerset. Clarke and Harrison also have a close relationship from negotiating media deals.","UEFA are considering staging mini-tournaments outside Europe .

"A medical student claims to have cured himself of a debilitating disease by taking up smoking. Formerly a non-smoker, Stephen Pendry, 23, struggled with crippling pain, tiredness, shortness of breath and dehydration since he was diagnosed with bowel disease ulcerative  colitis four years ago. He had to rush to the toilet up to 15 times a day but is now completely symptom-free, thanks to a new four-a-day cigarette habit. No more discomfort? Stephen Pendry claims to have completely cured his debilitating bowel condition by starting a four-a-day cigarette habit . The incredible turnaround is due to a side-effect of nicotine, hardly known outside medical circles, which cancels out damage caused by the disease. The trainee pharmacologist from Croydon, south London, who had never previously smoked, defied doctors’ recommendations of invasive surgery in favour of studies which showed patients with the disease improving after being given nicotine. He said: 'Smoking was my last option. I didn’t really want to wear a colostomy bag at the age of 23. 'Colitis is a condition which is constantly on your mind. It holds you back from doing a lot of things. 'Now, thanks to smoking, I do not suffer with the symptoms anymore and I can finally move on with my life. 'I know it’s controversial to say smoking can have positive effects, but doctors don’t always know best.' Mr Pendry was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in February 2008 and was forced to give up university following repeated visits to hospital. Dr Sean Kelly, Consultant . Gastroenterologist at York Hospital, has written on the link between nicotine and colitis in the British Medical Journal. He said: 'It is a well-established medical . fact that smoking protects against ulcerative colitis. 'It . is not widely-known outside specialised medical circles, and raises . eyebrows in patients and other doctors when explained, but the treatment . is well-known among those familiar with this condition. 'Rarely, we use tobacco as a bridge to conventional medical therapy. 'We . sometimes get an ex-smoker to start smoking again - for a short period - . to settle the colitis and then allow medicines, such as azathioprine, . to maintain remission after they have stopping smoking completely. 'This has worked in two out of three cases which I have personally dealt with.' Dr Kelly added it is common for ulcerative colitis to be found in patients who have recently stopped smoking. He said: 'The condition is three times more common in people who have given up or who never started smoking. We do not know why.' But other doctors believe nicotine is the healer so research into the benefits of wearing nicotine patches, and not smoking cigarettes, are the way forward. He said: 'It was so bad I was taken on a stretcher into hospital where I stayed for three days. I was very anaemic. After that my mum persuaded me to go back home and get better.' Despite struggling with symptoms, he re-sat his A-levels and began a new course in pharmacology at Bristol University. Doctors prescribed drugs which are usually used to help chemotherapy patients, but he found the side-effects unbearable. Then, in April this year, he read a study in which half of ulcerative colitis sufferers who took part in a trial experienced complete relief from symptoms when using a nicotine patch. He said: 'I had really bad headaches and I was really run-down on the medication. 'I found that smoking was quite a well recommended method in America, and decided to give it a try. 'Cigarettes, rather than patches, were the best option for me to get the nicotine. Patches aren’t routinely available on the NHS for this treatment and they are too expensive for me to buy. 'I am only smoking four cigarettes a day so I can make a one pack last for several days, meaning it works out cheaper. 'As a student, everyone in my shared house smokes, so smoking cigarettes was a natural thing to do. 'Within a week of starting smoking all of my symptoms disappeared.' Despite well-known links between cigarette smoking and cancer, Mr Pendry balanced the decision to take up the habit against equally well-established links between ulcerative colitis and bowel cancer. He said: 'The colitis, and the drugs used to treat it, can themselves cause cancer. 'I’m only smoking three or four cigarettes a day, so I don’t believe I am at risk.' Dr Sean Kelly, Consultant Gastroenterologist at York Hospital, who has written on the subject in the British Medical Journal, said: 'It is a well-established medical fact that smoking protects against ulcerative colitis. 'Rarely, we use tobacco as a bridge to conventional medical therapy. 'We sometimes get an ex-smoker to start smoking again - for a short period - to settle the colitis and then allow medicines, such as azathioprine, to maintain remission after they have stopping smoking completely. 'This has worked in two out of three cases which I have personally dealt with.' Dr Kelly added it is common for ulcerative colitis to be found in patients who have recently stopped smoking. He said: 'The condition is three times more common in people who have given up or who never started smoking. We do not know why. 'Around 20 years ago there was a lot of interest in using nicotine patches to treat ulcerative colitis, but the research was not terribly effective.' But Helen Terry, Director of Information at the National Association for Colitis and Crohn’s Disease, said cigarette smoking is not a safe treatment. She said: 'The recommendation of the medical advisors we work with is that although smoking has a known effect on ulcerative colitis, the general advice is to give up smoking. 'In terms of maintaining general health, not smoking is better for you than smoking.' And Martin Dockrell, Director of Research and Policy at charity Action on Smoking and Health said: 'The evidence doesn’t come from smoking, it comes from nicotine. 'There are ways of getting safe pharmacological nicotine in patches. We advise talking to a doctor about the benefits of going on nicotine replacement therapy. 'There is no need to try smoking which is, of course, very dangerous.'","Stephen Pendry, 23, struggled with crippling pain, tiredness, shortness of breath and dehydration since he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago .

"Everyone else saw a comical picture of a 25-year-old in a mini-kilt - and not much else - blowing off steam with a slightly embarrassed middle-aged team-mate. Paul McGinley saw the secret of Europe’s Ryder Cup success. The victorious captain on Wednesday pointed to the instantly infamous snap of Rory McIlroy and 39-year-old rookie Stephen Gallacher during Sunday night’s celebrations as evidence of the bonding that underpinned the home win at Gleneagles. McGinley, who said that half an hour spent watching highlights with his son on Monday had made him more emotional than he’d been during the week, explained: ‘To see the photograph in the newspapers on Monday with Stevie and Rory - Rory wearing the kilt - that, to me, just summarised everything we achieved, that sense of bonding.

'You could see they were so comfortable in each other’s company, there was an element of fun, and there was an element of enjoyment in terms of Stevie had a drink in his hand and Rory had his kilt on,' McGinley continued. ‘That summarised so much of what I wanted to achieve, a sense of bonding between the players that will last forever. ‘I look at my dad, he’s from a Gaelic football background in Donegal and I would go to the games with him sometimes. ‘To see him meet a guy that he might not have seen for maybe 40 years, who he used to play with - immediately that bonding is there and they are sitting down and having a chat and reminiscing about old times.

Europe celebrate their Ryder Cup triumph over USA which came to an end after singles matches on Sunday . ‘I would love to get my mind forward to see somebody like Stevie and Rory, in 50 years’ time, having a conversation. That photograph will live forever - and it’s something that just, for me, summarises so much about the week. ‘Stevie and Rory live different lives. Rory is in a stratosphere nobody is close to. Stevie is a local boy who has had an incredibly great year to make the team. ‘He was on a high playing The Ryder Cup and there he was with the superstar and the two of them were so comfortable in each other’s company. That’s special.’ McIlroy has insisted that he values his Ryder Cup record as highly as any individual achievement, revelling in the fact that he’s now won four Majors and three Ryder Cups quicker than anyone in history. ‘The Ryder Cup is important,’ he said. ‘In three Ryder Cups, I haven’t been beaten in the singles, which is something I’d love to keep going throughout my career. Still coming down from the high of the Ryder Cup, Rory McIlroy enjoyed a few holes at Carnoustie with his father Gerry (right) during his practice round ahead of the 2014 Alfred Dunhill Links Championship . McIlroy says The Ryder Cup 'is important' and aims to go through his career unbeaten as he is in singles . ‘I think Monty (Colin Montgomerie) was never beaten in the singles in a Ryder Cup. So that would be something to emulate. You know, at the age of 25, to have won three Ryder Cups and four Majors is something I’m proud of - eight years younger than anyone else. Tom Watson did it at 33, Gene Sarazen at 35. ‘I spoke to Paul McGinley and he’s retiring unbeaten after six Ryder Cups. I don’t think I’ll be able to emulate that - but I’d love to. I’d love to be able to help Europe win as many as possible.’ As for the snapshot sent around the world via social media, both men claim some degree of amnesia, McIlroy saying: ‘The timeline gets a bit fuzzy around midnight.’ Gallacher added: ‘First thing I knew about it was when I saw the picture! ‘If I had a body like that, I wouldn’t have a top on. Which explains why I’m wearing a jumper and a tee-shirt in the picture.’ Europe's Stephen Gallacher (centre) with his wife Helen (left) and son Jack (right) and the Ryder Cup .
