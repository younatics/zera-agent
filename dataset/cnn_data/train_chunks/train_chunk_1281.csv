"Former model Irene Major is a wealthy woman who knows all about looking after her skin. The wife of Canadian oil tycoon Sam Malin, she has tried everything from super-expensive Creme de la Mer moisturisers to the services of the most exclusive Harley Street dermatologists. But Irene, who’s originally from Cameroon, West Africa, has a shocking admission; she also regularly uses skin-lightening creams to alter the colour of her complexion. ‘When my skin is lighter, I just feel prettier,’ she admits with startling candour. ‘It’s a taboo subject, and people get judgmental about it, but that’s how I feel.’ Last month, High Street health store Holland & Barrett came under fire for selling a legal skin-whitening product called Dr Organic Royal Jelly Skin Body Whitening Cream, which retails for £9.99. Scroll down for video . Former model Irene Major is the wife of Canadian oil tycoon Sam Mail and has used skin lightening creams . The sale of the product provoked outrage, with some accusing the chain of encouraging racist ideals. Yet Irene, who’s 34 and lives with her husband and four children in a Kent mansion, claims that in some communities the pressure on women to use such products is overwhelming. ‘A skin-lightening regime has been part of my life practically since birth,’ she claims. ‘There are many different types of African skin — from dark charcoal to a lighter version — and you grow up knowing that the lighter ladies are the prettier ones. It’s just a fact.’ Her younger sister, Elsa, 27, agrees, explaining how disturbing hierarchies of skin colour are still influencing African girls. ‘Being lighter shows you belong to a different place on the social ladder. All the rich, successful black African men marry either a white or a very light-skinned girl because they too grew up thinking that the lighter is the most pretty. It doesn’t matter how dark a man is, of course — the pressure is all on women.’ Angela Agor, 41, a black television presenter from North London, bought many different products in her increasingly desperate attempt to lighten a patch of dark skin . Skin lightening is a multi-billion-pound global industry. Pharmacy shelves groan under the dozens of perfectly legal skin lightening products, from high-end Elizabeth Arden and Clinique to household brands such as Garnier and Vaseline. Holland & Barrett, meanwhile, insist their cream is specifically for use on skin blemishes such as ‘age spots, liver spots, freckles, sun damaged skin and scars’, and contains a brown algae called Ascophyllum nodosum, which has ‘proven skin whitening attributes’, according to a spokesman. But it’s not just the ethics of skin lightening that concern campaigners. Beyond these legal products, there’s a booming market in illegal creams, soaps and pills, many containing highly damaging ingredients such as mercury, bleach and acid. The worst of these, a chemical called hydroquinone, is officially banned in the EU, but can still be prescribed by dermatologists for cosmetic reasons — and isn’t hard to find in the UK. Angela stresses that she uses creams to tackle discolouration rather than to change the colour of her skin overall . ‘Anybody can use it, and everybody does,’ says Irene. ‘Just look at all the pop stars whose skin has got so much lighter over the years. Many celebrities do it. We’re just turning a blind eye to it.’ Essentially a bleaching agent, hydroquinone is the biological equivalent of paint stripper. In removing the top layer of skin, which initially results in a ‘brighter’ looking face, it also removes the body’s natural defence against infection and the sun, increasing the risk of skin cancer. If it enters the bloodstream, it can cause fatal liver and kidney damage. Skincare expert Sujata Jolly, who founded her clinic Clinogen Laboratories in Windsor 30 years ago, has treated many women desperate to reverse the chemical’s effects. ‘Some women develop hide-like skin around their eyes when they had hoped that hydroquinone preparations would treat their dark circles. Others get a kind of spotted, caviar-like effect on their skin.’ The British Skin Foundation lists a terrifying catalogue of potential side-effects resulting from the use of illegal skin creams, including foetal abnormalities in pregnant women who use preparations containing mercury and thinning of the skin due to high-dose steroid creams. Angela Agor, 41, a black television presenter from North London, bought many different products in her increasingly desperate attempt to lighten a patch of dark skin. ‘I had this blistering under my eye, which left me with what looked like a permanent black eye,’ she says. ‘Obviously I was very self-conscious about it. People kept asking me what was wrong. So when I found this cream in an East London market, I bought it, though I had no idea what was in it. In the end I tried all sorts of creams, some legal and some not. The thing is, they absolutely did make a difference to the darker patches around my eyes, so there was no incentive to stop.’ Angela stresses that she uses creams to tackle discolouration rather than to change the colour of her skin overall, yet, like Irene, she defends the right of black women to use lightening products to even out skin tone. ‘We bleach our hair, after all,’ she says. ‘I simply don’t understand the fuss about this Holland & Barrett cream.’ Abdul Alim, born in Manchester of Bangladeshi origin, launched his own fully above-board range of skin lightening creams ten years ago, and claims that women want paler skin to emulate film and pop stars. ‘The Bollywood film industry is one of the reasons that people continue to think that fairer is more beautiful,’ he says. But this focus on skin colour goes well beyond fashion. ‘In Asian communities,’ he continues, ‘when a photograph of a potential bride is passed around, the first thing noticed is their skin colour.’ ‘People say: “She’s quite dark,” before any education credentials are looked at, for example.’ Angela says ‘I simply don’t understand the fuss about this Holland & Barrett cream’ The main agent in Abdul’s Nur76 range is a synthetic compound called alpha arbutin, which inhibits the production of the skin pigment melanin. But it doesn’t come cheap. The most popular product in his range sells at an eye-popping £97 per bottle. ‘Our customers are more than 90 per cent female and split equally between Asian and black consumers,’ he says. Abdul, 32, says he has more than 100,000 customers worldwide; and he practises what he preaches, using the products on his own skin with startling results according to pictures on his website. It is not a habit without risks, he admits, but only when women fail to follow instructions and misuse the creams. ‘The danger of Nur76 is that it can become addictive as people start seeing the effects and want to use more and more. One customer poured more than 100 bottles of the skin lightening cream into the bath, hoping they would lighten quicker.’ Despite the already dramatic change in her skin colour, Elsa Major, for one, would go paler still. ‘It’s my choice. I would never judge a white woman for choosing to tan her skin,’ she says. Meanwhile, Irene’s reaction to the controversy surrounding the Holland & Barrett skin lightening cream was simple — she went out and stocked up. ‘It’s early days, so I can’t really report on how effective it is yet,’ she says. In a bid for celebrity status, the sisters have launched their own pop group and freely admit this career choice further fuels their desire to be pale. ‘I think every woman is free to do what she wants,’ says Irene, ‘and personally, I feel more like me when my skin is lighter.’ But Irene and Elsa aren’t alone. And as the global entertainment industry presents an ever-more standardised version of the female ideal, the skin lightening craze will only continue.","Former model Irene Major is the wife of Canadian oil tycoon Sam Mail .

"A high school student who disappeared after posting a Tweet claiming there was an intruder in her house has been spotted on CCTV at a train station. Kara Alongi, 16, posted a misspelled message to her Twitter page around 6.20pm Sunday night that gave the impression that she was in a panic, stating: 'There is someone in my hour ecall 911'. Her Twitter followers did not call the . authorities, but her parents did once they returned to the family home . in Clark, New Jersey, and realized that the girl was missing. But the teenager has now been spotted on CCTV holding a backpack and a large purse while waiting for a train at the NJ Transit station in Rahway. Missing: Kara Alongi, 16, has been caught on CCTV at the NJ Transit Station in Rahway . Suspicious claim: Kara Alongi, 16, posted this message to Twitter around 6.20om on Sunday night while her family was out watching her younger brother's sporting game . The 16-year-old's lone tweet that appeared to be a desperate plea for help went viral with hundreds of Twitter messages posted hoping for a her safe return. Clark police confirmed Sunday night that the girl's initial tweet was a hoax and there were no signs of foul play in Alongi 's home. The teenager is still missing. At the time of her disappearance, her family were watching her younger brother's sporting event. Police brought a canine unit to the home and, according to their press release, the dogs 'tracked Kara's scent from the back door of the house, through a neighbor's yard and then to the sidewalk and around the corner back onto her block where the scent goes cold.' After initially believing the Tweet, police became suspicious because there were no signs of foul play or abduction. Disappeared: Police traced a phone call placed from her house to a local cab company around the same time as the Tweet, and the cab driver identified her as the girl he picked up . The biggest sign, however, that something was amiss came from phone records that showed someone in the Alongi's home called a local taxi company and ordered a pick up at their address right around the time that Kara posted the intruder claim to Twitter. 'The investigation quickly revealed a number of inconsistencies in the teen's statement,' the police statement reveals. The local Patch site reports that police got in touch with the taxi driver who picked up the request, and the man identified Kara as the girl he drove to the nearby Rahway train station. Gone: The taxi driver took her to the nearby Rahway train station which has regular services to Manhattan . The train station serves the Northeast Corridor line and the North Jersey Coast line, both of which have their northern-most stop in Manhattan. 'Kara might feel that she will be in trouble if she comes home after this scare and causing a panic. At this point all everyone cares about is seeing her safe and at her house where she belongs,' the police statement concluded. As of noon on Monday, Kara was still listed as missing and police have not reported any further developments from their overnight search.","Girl, 16, urged Twitter followers to call police because of alleged intruder .

"A Russian oil baron and his business tycoon ex-wife have made legal history with a courtroom battle over their £6.4million former matrimonial home in London. Alexei Golubovich and Olga Mirimskaya have followed in the footsteps of their son, Ilya, to become the first foreign dynasty in which two consecutive generations have sought the aid of the English courts in dealing with the fallout from divorce. Mrs Mirimskaya, a multi-millionaire businesswoman who is boss of the Russian equivalent of Tesco, moved to London with her husband - a former top executive of giant Russian oil company, Yukos - and their three children in 2003. Acrimonious: Russian oil baron Alexei Golubovich and his business tycoon ex-wife Olga Mirimskaya are fighting over assets in the UK courts . Battle: At the centre of the row is this £6.4m London home, in Chiswick, which both say they own . The family selected a prime piece of real estate as their palatial home on Upper Mall in Chiswick, on the banks of the Thames, attended by a full compliment of servants, including drivers and cleaners, to see to their every need. However, when the pair separated in 2008, and divorced in Russia last year, the house and adjoining land, now estimated to be worth £6.4m, became a battleground, with each of the former spouses claiming it belongs to them alone. Now the former couple have lodged papers with the High Court in London and are each suing the other in a legal tug of war, with the multi-million pound property as the prize. The couple’s decision to bring their row to British shores follows hot on the heels of a battle between their son Ilya Golubovich and his ex-wife Elena which made headlines in 2011. In that case, the Court of Appeal upheld a divorce judge’s decision to award Elena £2.85m after a marriage lasting just 18 months. In a writ, Mrs Mirimskaya says that the off-shore company through which the house was bought in a complex series of transactions in 2004 was beneficially owned entirely by her and that the property was transferred into her sole name the following year. Although the house was put into her husband’s name in 2008, she says it was 'the common intention' of both of them, right from the start, that she would continue to be 'the 100% beneficial owner of the property'. Similar: Their couple's son Ilya Golubovich (left) lost out to his ex-wife Elena Golubovich (right), who was awarded a £2.835m divorce payout after their 18-month marriage broke down . Insisting that all expenses - . including utility bills, taxes and staff costs - have been paid by her . or companies controlled by her, Mrs Mirimskaya says her ex-husband holds . the property on trust for her and she intends to give it to their . daughter when she gets back legal title to it. However, . in his defence to the claim, Richard Wilson, Mr Golubovich’s barrister, . insists that his ex-wife owns no part of the house. He says Mr Golubovich came to love England as his home and ‘settled’ in the house with the then couple’s two younger children, their niece and his mother-in-law, whilst Mrs Mirmskaya ‘spent most of her time outside the United Kingdom’. And the oligarch insists that the property was transferred into his sole ownership in 2008 as part of the agreed division of their assets, the marriage having broken down partly due to his wish to stay in England whilst his ex-wife wanted to live abroad. Mr Wilson claims the transfer 'had the effect of removing the property from the joint ownership of the couple and transferring it to the sole ownership of Mr Golubovich...as a matter of English law he is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the property.' Mr Golubovich has been described as one of Russia’s richest men and his ex-wife is chairman of Russki Product, Russia’s largest domestic producer of grocery goods.","Alexei Golubovich and Olga Mirimskaya divorced in Russia - now in UK battle .

"Extraordinary: Dr George Hibbert faces claims he deliberately misdiagnosed parents with mental disorders - decisions which meant their children were taken away from them . A leading psychiatrist faces extraordinary claims he deliberately misdiagnosed parents with mental disorders – decisions which meant their children were taken away from them. Dr George Hibbert faces being struck off over his conclusions that hundreds had ‘personality disorders’ after assessing them at his private family centre. He was paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by social services for the reports which tore children from their parents – many of them young mothers. He is now being investigated over shocking suggestions he distorted the assessments to fit the view of social services. In one case, he is alleged to have wrongly diagnosed a ‘caring’ new mother –  named only as Miss A – with bipolar disorder because her local authority wanted the  baby adopted. After being confronted with this allegation, Dr Hibbert offered to surrender his licence to practise as a doctor rather than face a General Medical Council inquiry. But his request has been rejected by the GMC which says there are still ‘unresolved concerns regarding his fitness to practise’. He will now face a full fitness to practise hearing. Yesterday John Hemming MP, who has raised concerns about Dr Hibbert in Parliament, described the claims as shocking. The Lib Dem MP – alerted by a whistle-blower – said he had since spoken to ‘three or four’ other families who said the same had happened to them. He has written to Justice Secretary Ken Clarke demanding a full parliamentary inquiry. Mr Hemming said: ‘He is someone about whom a number of people have complained. I am told that at least one person has refused to work for him because of what she saw as his unethical provision of reports to suit the demands of local authorities. Rich: Two Porsches can be seen parked outside the home of Dr Hibbert near Swindon. At one point in 2010, when he had 11 residents in the centre at one time, Dr Hibbert was raking in more than £40,000 a week . ‘Much of the decision making in care proceedings rests on reports from experts such as Dr Hibbert,’ he told Parliament. He . added that supposedly independent experts such as Dr Hibbert, 59, were . often little more than ‘the hired gun of the local authority’. The lack of transparency over such experts was leading to ‘thousands of miscarriages of justice in care proceedings’. Earlier this week, a study for the . Family Justice Council revealed how life-changing decisions about the . care of children are routinely being made on the basis of flawed . evidence. A fifth of ‘experts’ who advise the family courts are . unqualified. Dr Hibbert . charged local authorities £6,000 a week for every family in his care and . £210 an hour just to read documents such as medical records. By . 2007 his company, Assessment in Care, was making a profit of around . £460,000 a year from  his lucrative arrangement with social services. He . is now worth more than  £2.7million. Last night a black Porsche Turbo, . thought to be worth around £120,000, and a grey Porsche 911 Carrera, . worth around £80,000, were parked on the gravel driveway outside his . £500,000 country cottage. A former honorary lecturer at Oxford University, who has previously advised the government on care assessments, Dr Hibbert left the NHS to set up his private assessment centre in 2000. Since then, hundreds of parents in contact with social services – usually mothers and babies – have been referred to his centre to  be assessed. Concerns were first raised in 2007, when mother Miss A complained that Dr Hibbert had wrongly diagnosed her with a bipolar disorder. One consultant psychiatrist accused Dr Hibbert of having ‘no evidence’ for some of his claims and of deliberately ‘exaggerating’ and ‘misrepresenting’ aspects of the woman’s behaviour. Her report is among a number of documents being examined by the GMC with regards to Dr Hibbert. Miss A, who has seen her son just a few times since, said Dr Hibbert was ‘corrupt and evil.’ ‘Nothing will ever make up for what he has done to me and my child,’ Miss A said. ‘I want to make sure this man is exposed and that he can never do this to anybody else.’ In a letter sent to Miss A, a GMC investigations officer confirmed Dr Hibbert ‘has now applied for voluntary erasure from the medical register’. In demand: Dr Hibbert was paid hundreds of thousands of pounds by social services for reports which tore children from their parents - many of them young mothers . The letter continued: ‘He has no intention of returning to clinical practice in the future.’ However, the GMC officer concluded it was in the ‘public interest’ for his request to be denied ‘in view of the nature of the performance allegations and in the view of the conduct concerns.’ He has not been available for comment at his two-storey detached cottage in the small village of Blunsdon near Swindon. His assessment centre next to his home appeared to be closed. A spokesman for Dr Hibbert at the Medical Protection Society, the indemnity organisation for doctors, said professional confidentiality meant Dr Hibbert was ‘unable to comment on allegations raised in relation to care of a patient’. Paul Grant, of Bernard Chill & Axtell Solicitors, who represents Miss A, said: ‘Our client has instructed us to launch proceedings against Dr Hibbert and the local authority. ‘We believe this distressing case may be the tip of a very big iceberg.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr George Hibbert could be struck off .

"Italy put aside their dismal showing at the World Cup in Brazil to cruise to a 2-0 victory over Holland at the Stadio San Nicola in Bari on Thursday. The Azzurri were knocked out of the World Cup at the group stage with just three points but goals from Ciro Immobile and Daniele De Rossi inside the first 10 minutes of this encounter gave Antonio a comfortable victory in his first match in charge. Guus Hiddink oversaw his first Holland match since 1998 but he will not have been impressed with what he witnessed. Bruno Martins Indi was dismissed after just nine minutes to allow De Rossi to net from the spot and double Italy's advantage, and Holland simply did not recover.

The departure of Louis van Gaal, who inspired Holland to a semi-final in Brazil, to Manchester United also saw the removal of the in vogue 3-5-2 formation for the Dutch, who instead opted for a more fluid 4-3-3. Robin van Persie was joined in the starting line-up by new United team-mate Daley Blind, who signed for £14million from Ajax on transfer deadline day, as well as Newcastle United full-back Daryl Janmaat and former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt. Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben was deemed unfit and did not even find himself on the bench. Italy, meanwhile, rested Juventus legend Gianluigi Buffon and instead started with Salvatore Sirigu in goal. Borussia Dortmund forward Ciro Immobile and debutant Sassuolo Zaza were chosen to lead the line in Mario Balotelli's absence - the £16m Liverpool striker was suspended for the match. And it was the home side who dominated the match from the off, with Immobile streaming through after just three minutes to open his account for Italy. After receiving a long ball through the middle, Immobile ran past Stefan De Vrij and Martins Indi before rounding Holland 'keeper Jasper Cillessen and stroked the ball home. But it would only get worse for the Dutch as seven minutes later they found themselves with a two-goal deficit and a man down. Zaza displayed his raw power to rush in behind Martins Indi and force the defender to drag him down inside the box. Martins Indi was the last man and had to go - and Hiddink could only watch from the bench as Italy captain De Rossi stepped up and slotted the ball into the bottom corner from the spot. The rest of the first half continued in much the same vein, with Italy missing guilt-edged chances through Mattia De Sciglio and Zaza. Holland did improve marginally in the second half although, in truth, they could hardly have performed much worse.

Their best chance came when Azzurri defender Andrea Ranocchia could only clear a Kuyt cross straight to Blind, whose cushion header gave Van Persie a chance to score but he smashed his left-foot volley harmlessly past the post. Aside from a couple of Van Persie misses, there was little for the Dutch to be proud about. They were simply outclassed from the very first minute to the last. Italy's main threat all night had been the pace of Zaza and Immobile up front, but Leonardo Bonucci almost stole the headlines with a thunderbolt from 35 yards which forced Cillessen into a nervy parry. Conte can be pleased with his first match in charge. Hiddink on the other hand has a lot of thinking to do.

"A mother lost her left eye after suffering a rare infection she believes was caused by her contact lens. Jacqui Stone endured 22 operations and more than 17 weeks in hospital after wearing a disposable lens from a popular brand. Doctors had to remove her eye because of fears the rare but aggressive fungal infection would penetrate her optic nerve and enter her brain. Warning: Graphic images below . Infection: Jacqui Stone, 42 spent 17 weeks in hospital after wearing her contact lenses for one day . Aggressive: Surgeons feared the rare fungus would penetrate her optic nerve and enter her brain . Shocking: The maths teaching assistant bought the popular brand of lenses online in the UK . Mrs Stone, 42, said: ‘They tried everything to save my eye but the fungus had grown too strong. ‘It would have killed me. I’m terrified the fungus will come back if I get ill.’ The maths teaching assistant bought . the Focus Dailies All-Day Comfort Lenses from a UK website last May to . help her see the whiteboard better in the classroom. The mother of two, . who has worn contact lenses ‘on and off’ for 20 years, said everything . seemed normal when she put the lenses in. She added: ‘I am one of those people . who doesn’t take risks – I know I washed my hands when I put them in. It . wasn’t until I got home at 5pm that I thought “these feel awful” and . had to take them out. ‘I threw them away as they were . disposables and didn’t think any more about it at the time. But the next . day I had very blurred vision out of my left eye. At the time I thought . it was painful but the pain just got worse and worse.’ Last resort: The teaching assistant had 22 operations to save her eye, but the fungus was deeply rooted . Too late: The mother wears a prosthetic left eye after surgeons were forced to remove the infected eyeball . Agony: Days after wearing the disposable lens, Mrs Stone was taken to hospital in excruciating pain . Mrs Stone, of Braintree, Essex, was . taken to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford, two days later when the pain . became unbearable. She was given eye drops and sent home the same day . but returned less than 24 hours later after again suffering excruciating . pain. She added: ‘I was screaming in pain and my teeth were chattering – it was unbearable. ‘They told me they had given me enough morphine for a broken leg but the drugs didn’t touch it. She was referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital in London over the Jubilee weekend but her condition continued to worsen. By June, Mrs Stone was making almost daily visits to the hospital because of the pain. Suffering: Mrs Stone was given enough morphine for a broken leg - but the pain was still unbearable . Close to death: The fungus ate away at three layers of her eye and 70 nerves . The fungus still could be lying dormant in her body and there is a chance she could lose sight in her right eye too . On June 21 last year she was referred . to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, where she was diagnosed with an . infection caused by the fungus Fusarium. By then it had eaten away at three layers of her eye and at 70 nerves. She underwent 22 procedures to save . her eye, including two corneal transplants, at Addenbrooke’s – but the . fungus was too deep rooted. A woman was left in agony after suffering an allergic reaction to eyelash extensions. Jane Rolfe, 42, suffered severely . blistered skin and a badly swollen face after having a reaction to the . glue used to apply the eyelashes. But when Mrs Rolfe, a primary school teaching assistant, returned to the salon they were unable to remove the extensions. Instead the mother of one was forced to spend more than five hours peeling the lashes off herself. She said: ‘I have never felt pain . like it. For weeks after I couldn’t open my eyes properly and my vision . seemed blurred. The whole experience was harrowing.’ Although Mrs Rolfe told her beautician she had never had extensions before, she says she was not given an allergy test. She fears the incident may have . triggered a lifelong intolerance to adhesives after she had another . reaction to household superglue. She has filed a claim for . compensation against Allianz, the insurance company for Debut beauty . salon in Brentwood, Essex – but the insurer is refusing to pay out, . saying the salon broke its policy terms by not doing a patch test. The Debut salon owner was unavailable for comment. Mrs Stone now wears a temporary . prosthetic eye and will begin having one specially made next week. She . is suing Alcon UK, which manufactures Focus Dailies, as well as . preparing a joint case against Broomfield Hospital and Moorfields . Hospital for clinical negligence. She said: ‘What makes me angry is I . now know that if I had been given the correct drops in the first couple . of weeks I would still have my eye. ‘I still can’t have steroids as the fungus could be laying dormant in my body and drugs could trigger it. ‘There is also a risk of losing sight in my right eye when my left eye completely shuts down as they are connected.’ A spokesman for Alcon said: ‘Alcon is . aware of a claim by a UK consumer that she experienced health-related . complications from an eye infection she acquired in spring 2012 . resulting in her losing one eye. ‘She is alleging that the infection was connected to her use of our contact lens. ‘Alcon was concerned to hear of this . and conducted an investigation based on the evidence provided but did . not find any connection between the contact lens and the consumer’s . unfortunate experience. ‘Alcon is committed to promoting safe . and effective contact lens wear and ensuring the safety of patients and . the efficacy and integrity of all its products.’ A spokesman for Moorfields Eye Hospital said it was reviewing the care that Mrs Stone received. They added: ‘No legal claim has yet been commenced.’ Dr Ronan Fenton, medical director at . Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, said it had worked with Mrs Stone . to investigate the circumstances around the loss of her eye. He added: ‘Not withstanding the likelihood of legal proceedings we hope this positive co-operation will continue.’","Jacqui Stone, 42, had 22 operations on her eye but doctors couldn't save it .

"A U.S. space plane, shrouded in secrecy, has broken its own longevity record by staying in orbit for more than 469 days. The flight is the third for the X-37B mystery mission and was launched on December 11, 2012, atop an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral. Little is known about the spacecraft, which is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. A U.S. space plane, shrouded in secrecy, has broken its own longevity record by staying in orbit for more than 469 days . The mission's first orbital launch, USA-212, took place on 22 April 2010. A second X-37 was launched on 5 March 2011 and returned to Earth on 16 June 2012. Up until now, the record for the longest X-37B mission is 469 days, set by the program's second mission launched in 2011. Mystery surrounds the exact type and capabilities of the hardware aboard with some analysts suggesting it will be used to support U.S. soldiers in various warzones around the world. The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three secret missions to date. Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29 feet (8.8m) long and 9.5 feet (2.9 m) tall. It has a wingspan just less than 15 feet (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000 lbs (4,990 kg). The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. Astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell told IDG it seems clear one of the big features is the plane’s ability to stay in space for extended periods of time. ‘The Air Force now has a policy of acquiring capabilities rather than missions, so some general somewhere probably thinks it would be spiffy to have a space plane that can launch at short notice,’ he said. ‘It’s worthwhile learning lessons from the shuttle and how to do turn-arounds cheaper.’ Ahead of the X-37B’s first launch, officials said the craft would conduct experiments involving the transport of satellite sensors, subsystems, components, and associated technology into space. ‘I believe it’s testing some kind of experimental sensor for the National Reconnaissance Office; for example, a hyper spectral imager, or some new kind of signals intelligence package,’ Mr McDowell said to IDG. ‘The sensor was more successful than expected, so the payload customer asked the X-37 folks to keep the spacecraft in orbit longer.’ Personnel are shown here inspecting the X-37B, the Air Force's first unmanned re-entry spacecraft, after landing on December 3, 2010 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . There are rumours circulating that the craft has been kept in space to spy on the new Chinese space station, Tiangong. However, analysts have pointed out that surveillance would be tricky, since the spacecraft would rush past each other at thousands of metres per second. In May 2011, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance. Other industry analysts have speculated that the Air Force is just making use of the X-37B’s amazing fuel efficiency and keeping it in space for as long as possible to show off its credentials and protect it from budget cuts. This April 5, 2010 photo made available by the U.S. Air Force shows the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle at the Astrotech facility in Titusville Florida - this was the vehicle's second launch .

"A body believed to be that of a Maine resident missing since 2002 has been discovered in the front yard of his former house, in what police are now calling a homicide. Charles Woodburn was last seen alive in 2002. The 51-year-old man was never reported missing by his then-wife, Diana Darling, according to police. Other relatives, however, did contact the authorities about Woodburn’s disappearance. Missing person: The skeletal remains of Charles Woodbrun, 51, were found on his former property in Maine 12 years after his disappearance . Burial ground: Police acting on a tip searched the front yard of Woodburn's old home in Jefferson, now owned by his widow's second husband . Shallow grave: Cadaver dogs helped officers uncover a human skeleton buried along a wall . Police acting on a tip from a family member arrived at the missing man's old property in Jefferson last week accompanied by a cadaver dog and found a human skeleton buried in a shallow grave along a stone wall, Bangor Daily News reported. A backhoe was used to extract the body from the ground in the front yard. The Maine State Medical Examiner has ruled the death a homicide. Pathologists are still in the process of trying to positively identify the corpse. Woodburn’s cause of death has not been released, and police declined to share any more details about the investigation. After her husband’s disappearance 12 years ago, Diane Darling remarried, and her first husband's house at 219 Neck Road in Jefferson went to her new spouse, Robert Gaudette. 'I'm not going to get into the details other than that he has been cooperative with us and helpful in establishing that timeline as to what took place back in 2002-2003,' Sgt Jeff Love, with Maine State Police, told WMTW. What did she know? Diana Darling, Woodburn's wife, never reported him missing. She died in 2010 at age 54 . The woman passed away in 2010 at age 54.Robert Gaudette still owns the property where the body was recovered. Less than three weeks after Diane Darling’s passing, her former stepson contacted police to report Charles Woodburn missing - eight years after he vanished.","Charles Woodburn, 51, vanished from his Jefferson, Maine home in 2002 .

"The lawyer for a Mississippi man who was declared dead two decades ago, only to resurface as a murder suspect, does not deny that her client killed his girlfriend and her daughter, but claims he's being tried in the wrong court. In opening statements on Wednesday, attorney Cristie Gibbens said it was improper to charge Thomas Steven Sanders in federal court for the 2010 slaying of 12-year-old Lexis Roberts. She said prosecutors lack evidence to prove that Sanders committed a federal crime, rather than a crime that should be addressed in local courts. Otherwise, she said: 'We agree with the government on almost all of the facts.' Back from the dead: Thomas Steven Sanders, who went missing in Mississippi in 1987 and declared dead in 1994, has been found guilty of the 2010 slaying of his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter . Murdered: Lexis Roberts, 10, of Las Vegas, was found dead off a dirt track in remote Louisiana woods on October 8, 2010. She had been and her throat was slit . Gibbens said Sanders 'accepts full responsibility for the death of Lexis Roberts'. Roberts' skeletal remains were found off a gravel trail in rural Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, in October 2010, a month after authorities say Sanders dumped her body. Her mother's body was found later in Arizona. Prosecutor Bill Flanagan said Sanders shot the girl's mother, Suellen Roberts, on a trip all three took to a wildlife park near the Grand Canyon, then drove Lexis Roberts to Louisiana, where he shot her four times and cut her throat. Gibbens, who offered no explanation for the shootings called it 'a vacation that went terribly, horribly, sadly wrong'. Sanders was identified as a suspect long after he was thought dead. Sanders had left his family in Mississippi in 1987, and his relatives and ex-wife had him declared dead in 1994 after he had been missing for years. A middle-aged, balding man, Sanders sat quietly with his lawyers as the killings were described, periodically wiping his eyes. Dressed in a blue shirt and khakis, he wasn't handcuffed, but U.S. marshals sat nearby. Sanders is charged with two crimes: kidnapping resulting in death and using a firearm in a crime of violence that caused a person's death. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Killed: . After opening statements Wednesday, witnesses described finding Lexis Roberts' remains on hunting property. Photos of a skull with small pink braces still attached to the upper teeth were shown in court, along with a purple unicorn stuffed animal that was found in the woods near Roberts' bones. Sanders' lawyers didn't dispute that the remains were identified as Lexis Roberts. Flanagan said Sanders met Suellen Roberts while working and living at a storage facility in Las Vegas. Within a few months, they started dating and planned the Labor Day weekend trip that would end with both mother and daughter shot and killed, the prosecutor said. After visiting a wildlife refuge known as Bearizona and stopping at the Grand Canyon, the trio pulled into a remote stretch of desert off an interstate so Suellen Roberts could shoot Sanders' .22-caliber rifle, Flanagan said. Instead, Sanders shot the mother in the head while her daughter sat on a blanket nearby, Flanagan said. Sanders left the body where it fell and drove Lexis Roberts over several days to northeast Louisiana, where he shot her three times in the head and once in the chest, the prosecutor said. Write caption here . 'Lexis Roberts still had not died, and so he took his knife and he cut her throat,' Flanagan told jurors. FBI agent Glen Kelly said Sanders confessed to the child's death after being arrested in Gulfport, Mississippi, while still in possession of Suellen Roberts' car. 'He said something to the effect of, ''I'm surprised it took you so long to find me'',' Kelly testified. Gibbens said Sanders was in love with the mother. She said he acknowledged: 'I just shot her. I didn't know what to do after that.' Gibbens said that after learning how Lexis Roberts' body had decomposed in the woods, Sanders replied: 'She didn't deserve that.'","Thomas Steven Sanders was declared dead in Mississippi in 1994 after he abandoned his family seven years earlier .

"Andy Murray was back on the practice court on Tuesday, intent on making sure there will be no repeat of the mysterious attack of cramping that nearly put him out of the US Open almost before it had begun. His next opponent is lowly German qualifier Matthias Bachinger, but as Murray drily noted of his physical meltdown in the first round versus Robin Haase: ‘If he watched, I am sure he will be feeling pretty good about the match.’ Murray is supremely fit, a diligent trainer with a highly professional support team and has been in the American summer since early July, so there had to be other reasons for his distress against the Dutchman. Scroll down for video . Hot to trot: Andy Murray hit the practice court in the New York heat ahead of his second round US Open match . Bad sign: Murray suffered cramping in his legs during round one, a problem he hopes not to replicate . The inquest is likely to focus on the build-up to the match, which was unusual on two counts. Firstly, the women’s match beforehand took only 47 minutes so the players were on court very abruptly, which could have affected his fluid and carb intake beforehand. Best laid plans: The Scot has been in the States since early July acclimatising for the Grand Slam . Also, the 27-year-old Scot took the Friday before the tournament off and spent his time following Rory McIlroy at the golf in New Jersey, before heading to watch basketball in the evening at Madison Square Garden. Mark Leather, a master of sports physiology who is head of performance at Bolton Wanderers, pointed out that hydration can catch out even well-prepared athletes. ‘It can be relevant what you have done in the previous two or three days,’ said Leather. ‘Just having clear urine does not mean you are properly hydrated. People might underestimate what a finely tuned athlete someone like Andy Murray is and that fractional changes can make a bigger difference than expected. Air conditioning, like in an indoor stadium, can add to dehydration.’ The other most likely cause of cramping is tension although, after coming through in four sets, Murray said: ‘I didn’t feel particularly nervous. I’ve been a lot more nervous before Slam finals. It was weird.’ As Leather pointed out, however, the mind can work in ways beyond scientific understanding: ‘The power of the brain on the body is a grey area. And you could understand Andy being quite tense at some level. Hardly imposing: Murray admits his next opponent, German qualifier Matthias Bachinger, 'will be feeling pretty good about the match’ after seeing him struggle to victory over Robin Hasse in his first outing in New York . To the best of 'em: Sports physiologist Mark Leather says hydration can catch out even well-prepared athletes . ‘There is pressure on him, he has dropped down the rankings, there are a few questions. However tough you are, nobody is immune to those feelings.’ There is no doubt the Haase encounter was an awkward start to what is already a difficult tournament for Murray. It was played on his least favourite court at a Grand Slam, one where he has seen plenty of problems before - including against the same opponent. It was also his first match at a major since his uncharacteristic slump against Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon. The wider issue is that he has come to New York still searching for a significant win over a top-10 player this year. That is sure to gnaw away at his belief until it is rectified, as it surely will be in time. Unexplained: Murray says he didn't feel nervous but there's a chance tension could have been a factor for him . The fact Rafael Nadal, his Slam nemesis, is not here may also be adding to the pressure he places on himself. Well before the cramping began, Murray was not playing with much fluency against Haase and he put in five double faults before the first set was done. His ball toss — believed to be the cause of his much discussed outburst during the Dimitrov match at Wimbledon — appears to be an issue at the moment. It is much to Murray’s credit he still won. Lesser competitors would have succumbed, but he still has a shot at getting to the stage where he can claim the kind of major scalp that should turn his season around. It was confirmed that Murray, who appeared to be moving freely on the practice court, will play on Thursday giving him three days to ensure the cramping does not re-occur.

"Full back Mathieu Debuchy believes Arsenal will be 'incredible' once World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski have fully integrated back into the squad. The Germany trio are expected to be involved for the first time this season for Saturday's evening kick-off at Everton, having returning to London following an extended break. Arsenal have made a positive start to the new season, recording victories over Manchester City in the Community Shield at Wembley and Crystal Palace in the Barclays Premier League. They also left Istanbul with a goalless draw from the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Besiktas on Tuesday night. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Debuchy: Wenger was instrumental in me signing for Arsenal . Training: Mathieu Debuchy talks to Neil Banfield in Arsenal's training session at London Colney . Debuchy, signed from Newcastle earlier in the summer, is confident once Arsenal have all their key men up and running again, they will prove a force to be reckoned with. 'It is fantastic for me to be part of this team. When I see the squad now and I think that Ozil, Mertesacker and Podolski are still missing, it is incredible. It is an amazing squad,' Debuchy told the September edition of the official Arsenal magazine. 'Playing with them is pure happiness, even at training it is top level. 'You have to give your best all the time because the level required is immense.' Joy: New signing Debuchy said training with his new team-mates provides 'immense happiness' Debuchy has settled in quickly at right back, the £10million France defender filling the void left by the departure of compatriot Bacary Sagna to Manchester City on a free transfer. The 29-year-old is in no doubt everything is in place at Arsenal to help develop his game. 'This is another dimension. If you compare the training grounds for example, nothing at Lille or Newcastle can match the one at Arsenal. It is another world,' he said. 'Everything here is made to optimise your preparation and you as a player so you can be in the best condition to play and win football games.' Standards: Debuchy said the quality at Arsenal is higher than anything he has experienced before . Arsenal were beaten 3-0 at Everton in April last season, a result which looked to have dented their hopes of finishing in the top four. Wenger feels his squad have what it takes to produce the required performance away to the Premier League's stronger sides. 'A team is life and life is movement. That means the team doesn't stand still, we move forward and improve,' said Wenger, who must do without captain and former Everton midfielder Mikel Arteta, who will miss the game against his old club because of an ankle problem. Winners: Debuchy said that when Lukas Podolski and his fellow Germans come back Arsenal will be incredible . 'We have young players, which means that every year they can be better, also the team improves with success, which we had a reasonable (amount of) last year. 'We have a good opportunity on Saturday to show that we have moved forward and that we are stronger than last year. 'It will be interesting, because Everton are a team now flirting with the Champions League places. 'They were close last year. They lost some pivotal games which allowed us to get (back) in front of them after they beat us, but they have the quality, so it is a good, good test.'

"Russia could be planning to build a second reactor for Iran in exchange for oil, it has emerged. The Iranian ambassador to Moscow today revealed the plan to update Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant as one of many being discussed by the allies. Russia could also supply Iran with trucks, railroad tracks, mini-refineries or other goods to pay for the oil, ambassador Mehdi Sanaei told local media. It comes just a day before the six powers including Russia resume talks with Tehran on a nuclear deal. Talks: It emerged last month that Hassan Rouhani's nation may hand 500,000 barrels of oil a day to Putin's in exchange for goods, such as a second reactor at Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant . Last month it emerged Iran and Russia were negotiating to swap up to 500,000 barrels of oil per day for goods. The deal sparked fears that it would undermine Western efforts to maintain economic pressure on Tehran while global powers seek to curb its nuclear programme. In an interview published a day before the six powers including Russia resume talks with Tehran on a nuclear deal, Sanaei confirmed Russia and Iran were discussing supplies of 'a few hundred thousand barrels per day'. 'Iran could use some of the proceeds (to pay for) the construction by Russia companies of a second unit at the nuclear power plant in Bushehr,' he said. Russia built the first reactor at Bushehr, Iran's sole nuclear power plant. Sanaei said it was possible the oil deal, and a broad memorandum on economic cooperation, could be signed before August. Russian Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev is to visit Iran in April for talks on trade. Fears: Just days before the West attempts to re-enter nuclear power talks with Tehran, it emerges there could be a second nuclear reactor built at Iran's Bushehr plant . Asked what Russia could supply in exchange for the oil, Sanaei said the sides were discussing a number of possibilities including the construction of small oil refineries, Russian investment in gas fields and supplies of electricity. In addition to the possibility of Russia building a second reactor at Bushehr, he said Tehran was interested in supplies of heavy trucks or their assembly in Iran, and other items. 'Iran is interested in buying a huge amount of railroad tracks from Russia, as well as Russian involvement in the electrification of its railways. We are also interested in Russian grain.' Western nations fear an oil-swap deal would badly hurt efforts to forge a permanent agreement ensuring Iran's nuclear programme could not be used to make weapons in exchange for sanctions relief. An interim deal was reached in January. A top U.S. official said this month she believed the oil-for-goods swap would not go ahead in the near future after the United States warned both sides it would make reaching a nuclear agreement 'more difficult if not impossible'. Sanaei dismissed the U.S. concerns and said Russia should do the same, warning that European nations have sent business delegations to Iran and that Moscow risked losing lucrative opportunities if it failed to act fast. 'Our Russian friends, who have stood by us at difficult moments, should have advantages on the Iranian market... But Russian companies must hurry to get into their niche in our market and not hesitate out of fear of Western sanctions,' he said. Russia approved four rounds of U.N. Security Council sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme but has sharply criticised additional measures imposed by the United States and European Union, calling them counterproductive. The United States for years urged Russia to scrap its contract to build Bushehr, saying the project could help Tehran develop nuclear weapons capability. However, a deal requiring Iran to return spent fuel to Russia greatly eased those concerns.","Deal one of many discussed by the allies days before nuclear power talks .

"Liberty Ross, who is being awarded a multi-million pound settlement in her divorce from film director Rupert Sanders . She was left devastated when her philandering husband was caught publicly cheating on her with Twilight starlet Kristen Stewart. Now stunning model Liberty Ross has had the last laugh with a multi-million-pound divorce deal which hits her cheating ex where it hurts … in his wallet. Ross, 35, was heartbroken when her director husband Rupert Sanders was photographed in an intimate embrace with 24-year-old Stewart in a Hollywood car park in 2012. But in court papers filed in Los Angeles last week she proved revenge is a dish best served cold as it was revealed she will keep three of the couple’s four homes, earn £23,000 a month in spousal and child support and a percentage of some of his future film earnings. The 31-page document filed in LA Superior Court – which cites the grounds for divorce as ‘irreconcilable differences’ – also awards Ross eight per cent of Sanders’ gross income exceeding £1 million a year, half his pension plan – and even half of his credit card reward points. Vogue model Ross, who will remain in the couple’s £1.2 million Hollywood Hills home and gets ownership of two other properties in London’s Waterloo and Ladbroke Grove, will also receive half of Sanders’ ongoing earnings for Snow White And The Huntsman in which, ironically, she played Stewart’s mother Queen Eleanor. The film has earned more than £230 million at the box office. Sanders, 43, who issued a grovelling apology to his ‘beautiful wife and heavenly children’ after being caught cheating, keeps just the couple’s Malibu home, a 1970 Volkswagen van and a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder. The pair have agreed to joint custody of daughter Skylar, nine, and son Tennyson, seven, with Sanders agreeing to pay 75 per cent of their school and medical fees. Ross will receive £14,700 a month in spousal support until 2018 or her remarriage and £8,235 a month in child support. Ross was represented by Laura Wasser, a lawyer dubbed a ‘pitbull’ in Hollywood, who secured a reported £150 million settlement for Maria Shriver when husband Arnold Schwarzenegger admitted fathering a child with their maid. She has represented a Who’s Who of stars, including Heidi Klum and Angelina Jolie. Ross and Sanders, both British born, married in 2003. Ross had a thriving career as a model in London, appearing alongside Kate Moss in a 2002 Burberry campaign. She moved to Hollywood to support Sanders’ career. The divorce document puts his ‘gross wages’ at £88,000 a month and hers at ‘zero’. The model was heartbroken when this picture surfaced of Mr Sanders pictured in an intimate embrace with Twilight star Kristen Stewart . Sanders embarked on an affair with Stewart, the lead in Snow White And The Huntsman. Ross later revealed she learned of the affair 20 hours before paparazzi pictures of her husband embracing Stewart went public. The affair also led to the breakdown of Stewart’s relationship with Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson. Ross later told Vanity Fair the split was ‘horrible... I have no words to describe what we went through. ‘But, I think, for me, something has to completely die for there to be a rebirth. I visualised [being] this sort of Masai warrior. I was just going to stand very still and very strong.’ The model is dating Interscope record boss Jimmy Iovine, who has a fortune of about $1 billion, according to Forbes. The affair also led to the breakdown of Miss Stewart's relationship to her Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, pictured . Top divorce lawyer Raoul Felder, who represented Larry Fortensky in his split from Elizabeth Taylor, said last night: ‘This is an extraordinary settlement. She has taken him to the cleaners. When I see this sort of settlement, it is usually because the husband has a high degree of personal guilt. ‘Maybe he just wants to do the right thing. He is a relatively young man and so he is probably confident of his future earning potential.’ Representatives for Ross and Sanders did not respond to requests for comment last night.","Liberty Ross has been awarded a multi-million pound divorce deal .

"Denise Richards has revealed that she was targeted by hackers trying to gain access to her iCloud account. She tweeted today that she had received over ten emails asking for her password and threatening to shut down her accounts if she did not respond. The actress said 'good thing I didn't send,' after Apple confirmed yesterday that the leaks were the result of a 'very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. Scroll down for video . Denise Richards tweeted today that she had received over ten emails asking for her password and threatening to shut down her accounts if she did not respond . Richards tweeted her message this morning - although it is not known if the messages were part of a targetted attack or simply 'phishing' messages sent to hundreds of users. Experts say worried consumers should turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account. The tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password. To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID.Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security. Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices. A trusted device is one that can receive 4-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone. It comes as Kim Kardashian described this week's celebrity iCloud hack as a 'wake up call'. 'I think people in general just have to be cautious,' she told the BBC's Newsbeat, telling them 'I don't have an iCloud account on my phone'. The tech giant said it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. However, it is not known if the messages were part of the targetted attack or simply 'phishing' messages sent to hundreds of users. The so-called phishing emails are designed to trick people into offering up their detail. Scammers are then able to steal these login credentials to get access to the user's iCloud, which also provides access to their iTunes account and personal details. 'Whether or not iCloud was the point of compromise in this incident, scammers have been interested in stealing these credentials for some time,' explained Satnam Narang from security firm Symantec. 'These emails contain links to phishing websites that will capture your Apple ID credentials and send them back to the attackers. Apple said yesterday the attacks were not due to flaws in its systems. 'Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us,' it said in a statement. 'We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities. 'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple's engineers to discover the source.' 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet.' Kim Kardashian described this week's celebrity iCloud hack as a 'wake up call'. None of the cases  resulted from any breach in any of Apple's systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone, the firm said. MailOnline revealed that Hackers could have gained access to celebrity iCloud accounts using just an email address and a search engine. Apple's password reset system for accounts has become the latest target in the hunt to find out how nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other celebrities' were leaked. 'We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' The system allows people to reset a password by answering two security questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity users. The reset system allows those who have forgotten their password to reset it by answering a series of questions. Users are asked to first confirm their date of birth - which is straightforward to find online . They are then offered two options - to change their password using email authentication or by answering security questions . Hackers are believed to have used iCloud's password reset function to gain access to accounts. This allows users to reset their password by entering their username, date of birth and correctly answering two security questions. Experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities. Apple does email users to tell them their password has been changed. However, on the AnonIB hacking messageboard, those who say they have used the method claim that it's often best to reset the password at night so that the password reset email can be read and deleted before the target is awake. Rich Mogull, a security expert with Securosis, warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online. 'The key is not to put the real answers to these questions,' he told MailOnline. Users are then asked to answer two security questions, which range from their first car to their favourite job, which were set up when they signed up for the account. Mogull, who admitted hackers had tried to access his account, warned that it was still unclear exactly what happened. 'We don't know what happened yet, and In the security world, you need all the facts.' He also believed consumers were likely to stay with the firm despite the breaches. 'Historically we don't see a mass exodus from breaches, consumers don't seem to change their behaviour. 'There's a lot of historical precedent here - and this is just a first strike for Apple. 'It does appear that there was a flaw in iCloud - and we need to hear from Apple what the problem was, and what they are going to do to make it better,' Experts believe the breadth of the celebrities affected could be down to a 'chain effect' - once one celebrities phonebook was accessed, it could lead to dozens more. Security consultant Graham Cluley told MailOnline: 'For these attacks to work, you also need email addresses of target. 'But what we have seen is that hackers can access address books - and this would have helped the hackers.' Clulely also believes the 'reset password' system may have been used. 'It certainly possible that people would have used this,' he said. 'In the case of celebrities, these secret questions are very easy to find online - either in Wikipedia or by searching through some interviews.' Cluley said that anger was growing at Apple among iCloud users. 'Even though we don't know exactly what happened, the feeling is growing that Apple wasn't doing enough to stop this,' he said. However, Cluley believes customers will stick with Apple. 'I don't think we'll see a mass exodus - people's memory are very short. Jeffifer Lawrence and model Cara Delevingne are among those hit by the leaks so far . 'Apple is about to announce a new iPhone, and people will use iCloud to move their data do it, because it's such a simple process. The hacker claims he or she broke into stars' iCloud accounts, including those of the Hunger Games actress, Kate Upton and Rihanna, before publishing them on 4chan, the image-sharing forum. A list of the alleged victims of the hack - a staggering 101 in total - has also been posted online; most of whom have not seen any photographs leaked by the hacker. The hacker who posted the first batch of pictures said it was the result of 'several months of hard work by all those involved' Cluley said he thought 'more leaks are to come'. Experts also believed a flaw in Apple's Find my Phone was used for some of the hacks. However, despite not admitting the bug was caused by its system, the tech giant issued a 'patch', or fix, for the alleged 'Find My iPhone' bug. Code on software development site Github called iBrute, would have allowed malicious users to use 'brute force' to gain an account's password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. Apple has since issued a fix for the bug. 'The end of the fun, Apple has just patched,' read an update on the post. Brute force, also known as 'brute force cracking', is a trial-and-error method used to get plain-text passwords from encrypted data. Just as a criminal might break into, or 'crack' a safe by trying many possible combinations, a brute-force cracking attempt goes through all possible combinations of characters in sequence.In a six-letter attack. 'Many users use simple passwords that are the same across services so it's entirely possible to guess passwords using a tool like this,' said Owen Williams form The Next Web. And in a statement issued on Monday afternoon, the FBI confirmed that it had also begun an investigation. 'The FBI is aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter. 'Any further comment would be inappropriate at this time.' Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticise Apple on Monday when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter. The Spiderman star tweeted 'Thank you iCloud', the day after naked photos of her were published online.","Star tweeted that she received over ten emails asking for her password .
Apple confirmed yesterday that the leaks were  'very targeted attack'
Experts warn more leaks are to come ."
"Last week, the return of Match of The Day for its 50th anniversary was, for me, all about what it was going to be in the future. This week, on the actual weekend anniversary, it was a little more to do with its glorious past. And you have to say, the manner in which they did it, was a nice touch. Although I wonder whether giving Barry Davies a welcome return to the lip mic for West Ham’s game at Selhurst Park was the most tactful thing to do? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker take on Ice Bucket . One-off: Legendary commentator Barry Davies returned to Match of the Day on Saturday night . Master at work: Barry Davies in green blazer at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Old style: Match of the Day featured retro graphics for coverage of Premier League match . Old school: The Crystal Palace starting line-up features in the seventies-style graphics . Barry is certainly a veteran commentator, with one of the most engaging voices and sharpest brains there’s ever been in his business. But asking him to commentate on a team who play ‘19th Century football’ (copyright, Jose)? Bit harsh. Luckily for Barry, though, the Hammers had forsaken their hobnail boots for shooting ones. As a result he had one of the best games in the division on Saturday, into which he could skillfully weave his colours and textures. To make Barry feel perfectly back at home, the commemorative title sequence features one of his most celebrated moments. ‘Look at his face. Just look at his face’ implores Mr Davies as the cherubic chops of Frannie Lee glow in the wake of a Derby County goal. Yes kids, those are pictures of a former top flight centre forward in England! Retro: Match of the Day embraced a seventies theme for 50th anniversary of first edition . Moonlighting: Robbie Savage has been working with both the BBC and BT Sport . What’s more, this week they even threw in a few clips of Gary Lineker’s forebears. Amongst them, Jimmy Hill and Bob Wilson showing the new kids on the block how it’s done in the wardrobe department, with their sporty short-sleeved shirts. The picture was then completed on the match coverage itself. As we saw the match commentator weave his way to the commentary box, Gary reminded us it was 45-years ago at Selhurst Park where Barry had made his Match Of The Day debut. And we got the graphics such a return demanded. Big ones! BIG WHITE ONES!! In the second half, when Palace made a double substitution, you had to peer past the letters to see the action. As for Mr Davies being back at the helm is concerned, it really was a welcome return. The voice may not have the punch it once did, but it was still laden with all the right moves. His immediate reaction to West Ham’s exquisitely volleyed opener was an almost operatic chant of ‘oh, Mauro Zarate’. While for their second, Barry absolutely called it as he suggested out loud that Stewart Downing ‘could have a crack here?’. Spot on, sir. Clearly Barry still has a youthful enthusiasm for the game. And when he declared at the final whistle it had been an ‘entertaining afternoon’, I’m sure he meant both for himself, and for those watching a fine game of football. Stylish: Crystal Palace coach Gerry Francis (front left) fitted in with his splendid mullet . Although I wonder if he thinks there are some things that ain’t what they used to be, but perhaps should? I’m not totally convinced he was all that impressed when he noted Sam Allardyce was on the bench in the ‘tie undone style’. Sort it out, Big Sam! So a more than welcome reprise for one of the great voices of sport. On a show that also welcomed back to the pundit’s chair the newly bequiffed Robbie Savage. Which I must admit, left me pondering somewhat. Impressed: Viewers took to Twitter to praise Match of the Day's retro graphics . Perhaps I just don’t understand the transfer market for football experts? Only a couple of weeks ago, Robbie was announced as a major new signing for BT Sport. And indeed he has already been turning out for them on his new Saturday Morning show ‘Match Day Live With Fletch & Sav’. But clearly the loan system in the telly world means you can play for two teams at the same time. Now for me, I’d be wishing my old player the best of luck with his new challenge and look to bring in some fresh new talent who’d be proud to pull on just the ONE shirt. But perhaps like Barry, I’m from a different age? And although it may have come as a bit of a surprise to me, as Tom Jones sang at the start of this particularly vintage edition of Match Of The Day, it’s not unusual.","Barry Davies, aged 76, was brought back for one-off appearance .

"George Bailey has stepped down as Australia's Twenty20 captain to focus on the longer formats of cricket. Bailey led the Baggy Greens in 28 T20 internationals after succeeding Cameron White as skipper at the start of 2012, and has quit to concentrate on next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand and also earn a Test recall. The 32-year-old has not given up playing T20 cricket for his country but will not be available for the one-off encounter against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in October, or the three games against South Africa in November . End of an era: Bailey has been the Australian T20 captain for 28 matches since 2012 . Calling the shots: Bailey has an average of 26.11 in the shortest form of the game . Bailey will continue to lead the Hobart Hurricanes in the KFC T20 Big Bash League and Indian Premier League team Kings XI Punjab, as well as play first-class cricket for Tasmania. 'I've thoroughly enjoyed the responsibility and honour of leading Australia in T20 internationals,' he said. 'Over the last couple of months I have had the opportunity to reflect on my role as T20 captain and the direction I want to take my cricket over the next few years. 'Personally, I want to focus on my one-day cricket as well as becoming the best long-form player I can to give myself the very best chance to play Test cricket again. 'Stepping down from the T20 captaincy allows me the option of not playing some T20 international matches so I can play more four-day cricket for Tasmania this side of Christmas. Leader: Bailey will continue to play ODI cricket for his country but won't captain in the shortest form . 'With that in mind and also an eye to the future and the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, I consider this to be a good time to step down from the captaincy and allow a new captain the chance to settle into the role. 'I have had numerous discussions with Cricket Australia and they have been very supportive of my decision.' Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland praised Bailey's efforts during his two-and-a-half-year stint in charge. 'George is a fine leader and will certainly leave big shoes to fill as Australia's T20 captain,' Sutherland said. Big test: The batsman has played five Test matches for his country and wants more long-form cricket . 'I'd like to thank him for his efforts in captaining the country in the shortest form of the game. He is an excellent ambassador for Australian cricket, displaying great leadership and setting a positive example for younger players around the country.'

"It can cause major problems in water supplies, kill off fish and even give humans nausea, numbness and liver disease. Now the problem of algae in lakes has got so bad, Nasa is using a special sensor on the International Space Station to monitor it from orbit. The space agency has already released a stunning series of images showing the effect algae can have on Earth's lakes. Scroll down for video . A Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) image of a massive Microcystis bloom (shown in green) in western Lake Erie, Sept. 3, 2011, as confirmed by spectral analysis. On the right is an image created by scientists to better show off the algae. The Hyperspectral Imager is mounted to the exterior of the orbiting laboratory. It provides a way for researchers to see 90 wavelengths of light not visible to the human eye. This can help with research on harmful algal blooms (HABs) because they, along with other organic materials, have a 'spectral signature.' The biological matter emits a unique wavelength as it absorbs and scatters solar energy, resulting in fluorescence and backscattering. Essentially the light reflects back to HICO, which reads the data like a fingerprint. 'If you've been watching recent news of algal bloom concerns in Lake Erie, you know that the right conditions for algae can lead to contamination of local water sources, potentially impacting aquatic life and humans,' Nasa said.

Researchers can use the information from HICO to 'see' what they're missing with their own senses. With it they study biological and chemical signatures for aquatic and terrestrial materials. This can reveal the presence of microscopic plants, organic compounds, suspended sediments and other factors controlling water quality. The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) as seen aboard the International Space Station, where it is mounted to the Japanese Experiment Module External Facility. 'Historically, blooms have been visually observed by the naked eye due to the discoloration of the water,' said Ruhul Amin, Ph.D., principal investigator for the HICO CASIS-NRL project. 'Now optical sensors can detect these changes in the color of the water and quantitatively measure the spectral radiance changes due to algae blooms.' In the Lake Erie area researchers are looking at phytoplankton and algal blooms that occur regularly in summer months, often in the harmful quantities found this year. Of particular concern are blue-green algae Microcystis spp., which can cause health concerns in humans such as nausea, numbness or dizziness—potentially leading to liver damage. Once airborne in sea spray, the brevetoxin producing HAB Karenia brevis—known as red tide—can go beyond irritating the eyes and lungs of coastal visitors, according to Amin, as it is capable of killing fish, birds and marine mammals. No human fatalities are directly attributed to brevetoxins, he goes on to say, though it is possible to reach fatal toxin levels during K. brevis blooms . 'Unlike conventional multi-spectral images, the high spatial and spectral resolution afforded by HICO enables us to develop new approaches to more fully utilize hyperspectral data to distinguish HAB species from space,' said Amin. 'Conventional multi-spectral ocean color imagery in general does not contain sufficient information to discriminate between bloom species, but HICO's contiguous bands collect information that can enable us to identify the species.'

Researchers at the NRL-SSC have used HICO's ability to show visible and near infrared wavelengths to follow the Lake Erie blooms for years. The most recent HICO data collections for the area took place in mid-August as the station passed over the Great Lakes region. This information, in addition to ground data and other resources, can help with developing and validating bloom-detection algorithms.","Scientists are using instrument on ISS to monitor growth of algae .

"History will show Wayne Rooney to be a certain starter for any all-time Manchester United XI anyone cares to draw up. And whether people like it or not, he will edge Sir Geoff Hurst out of an all-time England XI to start up front alongside Gary Lineker in our traditional 4-4-2. Rooney currently sits third in United’s all-time goalscorer list, behind Denis Law who played less games, and record holder Sir Bobby Charlton, who played far more games. The Scouser is well on course to become the No 1. It should happen in the next couple of years, if Rooney’s return in recent seasons is anything to go by. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney: We came to Switzerland with a game plan . One of the best: Wayne Rooney stands on the brink of breaking records for club and country . Rooney has his detractors – as do Manchester United – but if and when he does sit proudly at the top of United’s list of all-time scorers, it will take some twisting and distorting of facts from those detractors to make that sound meaningless. Rooney’s goals have been scored in an era of unprecedented success for Manchester United. Up until recently United dominated domestically and with three Champions League finals in four years were second only on the continent to Barcelona, arguably the best team European club football has ever seen. Rooney’s goals were crucial, and helped United achieve trophies and glory. Leading the way: Only Sir Bobby Charlton and Denis Law are ahead of Rooney in United's scorers list . The Rooney-sceptics will point to the transfer requests, but that stuff doesn’t affect legend status. The great Bobby Moore once wanted a move to Tottenham, but that doesn’t stop him being a West Ham legend, does it? Rooney is on course to have more goals and more medals at club level than Charlton, Law and George Best. Only an unwillingness to face facts could lead anyone to suggest when he finally breaks the record at Old Trafford, Rooney will be a Manchester United legend, and arguably their greatest player of all time. For his country Rooney’s story is different. He hasn’t scored a hat-trick in a World Cup final like Sir Geoff Hurst – in fact he hasn’t ever scored a hat-trick for England. Rooney hasn’t won a World Cup Golden Boot like Gary Lineker. Opening up: Rooney scored a hat-trick on his Manchester United debut against Fenerbache . But Rooney is on course to be England’s all time record goalscorer, and I loved to hear him talk at the weekend about his desire to be the No 1 for England. That’s passion for your country! It would be a huge achievement and if it happens, will make him an England great. Lineker and Charlton are the top two, and they scored their goals for England during periods of great success. Charlton won the World Cup on home soil, Lineker played in a World Cup semi-final as well as a quarter-final. Leading the way: Rooney has been named England captain and could break all records . Third on the list, and the only other player above Rooney, is Jimmy Greaves. He was in the 1966 squad of course, but his record at World Cups isn’t good at all. Just 1 goal in 7 appearances in the finals, no goals in the ‘66 tournament, and not considered vital enough to the team for him to return for the final against West Germany when fully fit. In 1962 in Chile his main contribution was to pick up a pitch-invading dog during England’s defeat to Brazil. The animal then urinated all over Greaves’ England shirt. You can add your own punchline. Hat-trick hero: Gary Lineker is ahead of Rooney in the England goalscoring lists . Good record: Jimmy Greaves has a good goalscoring record for England - but not at World Cups . Greaves did score six hat-tricks for England, but as will as sitting only third in the list, that lack of impact at World Cups – at a time when England lifted that trophy – holds Greaves back from being a true international great, although at club level his statistics are incredible. Rooney’s lack of goals has been part of England’s problem at World Cups of course, but he has been our main striker during a period of relative failure, which makes the number of goals he has chalked up for his country all the more remarkable. For some players to achieve greatness on the international scene they have to do it at a World Cup. That’s the real test. But it’s not the only way to become a great for your country. Sitting on top of the all-time record goalscorers list will make Rooney an England great. He’s already scored more goals in competitive games than any other England player in history. Only injury will stop Rooney from breaking the record and achieving greatness.

"Among the brides who have travelled to Syria to join the jihadi cause is Salma Halane, 16, from Chortle, Manchester . An ever-growing band of young women have left their families in Britain to join the jihadi cause in Syria. Researchers have identified six more such women through their online accounts – and warn this could be the tip of the iceberg. Many have formed ‘intense friendships’ in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, where they appear as content shopping with friends as declaring their hatred of the UK. Academics at King’s College in London said they have seen ‘a big uptake’ in the number of UK women going to Syria. Among them are Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, twins from Chorlton, Manchester, and mother-of-one Khadijah Dare, 22, who is married to a Swedish jihadist. Privately educated radiography student Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, made headline news this week after her sobbing middle-class parents begged her to return. Mahmood even compiled an online ‘Diary of Muhajirah’, advising would-be brides to ‘bring make-up and jewellery from the West because please trust me there is absolutely nothing here – unless you plan on looking like a clown.’ The rise in female recruitment comes as it emerged British jihadis in Syria have contacted the UK pleading to return home without being imprisoned. As many as 600 Britons are believed to have joined Islamic forces fighting President Bashar Assad in the last three years. But many have become disillusioned with the brutal IS regime and associated groups. Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to ban British fanatics fighting in Iraq and Syria from re-entering the UK. However, one jihadist who represents up to 30 Britons has already approached an intermediary about the possibility of returning without the threat of prosecution, insisting they pose no risk to the UK. He said they were willing to enter de-radicalisation programmes. Intelligence officials said last night they were aware some fighters were investigating ways of returning to Britain. But one Syrian anti-terror expert warned: ‘You only need one to be wrong. Where do you draw the lines between the groups?’ Privately educated radiography student Aqsa Mahmood, 20, from Glasgow, made headline news this week after her sobbing middle-class parents begged her to return .","Researchers have identified six such women through online accounts .

"The launch of the Apple Watch had the internet’s army of jokers in full flow as they rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget. The real thing syncs with an iPhone to show notifications and can track the wearer’s heart rate – and it’s set to cost $349 when it goes on sale early next year. But for those who just couldn’t wait until then, or afford the official version, a common theme quickly developed in which a plain old apple was strapped to the user’s wrist. Scroll down for video . Following the unveiling of Apple’s smartwatch in California last night, internet jokers rushed to post pictures of their own version of the gadget. These included a red apple carved into a classic wristwatch design with a rounded face (pictured), created by Japanese Twitter user Hiromichi Shoji . But a few more inventive souls were able to take the joke a bit further - either by eating the apple, having it tell the time or, as one more creative type managed, actually carving a watch out of the fruit. The carved version was created by Japanese Twitter user Hiromichi Shoji, who goes by the username @sinomoritsukasa. The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user to the home screen. The Glances feature shows information users would like to see, similar to Google Now. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. The Apple Watch goes on sale early 2015 and prices will start at $349. He carved a red apple into a classic wristwatch design with a rounded face – although Apple’s version was rectangular and less sticky to the touch. Twitter user @christonation strapped a red apple to his wrist using tape before writing the time in digital format on the ‘face’. @findwin simply placed an apple on top of his existing watch, while maverick Firanglani on Instagram placed his watch around the apple. Instagram user Calumdilieto even ate the apple and placed the remains on his watch, making reference to the watch’s ‘core’ processor.

"Mo Farah marked his first appearance on a British track in more than a year by claiming his eighth national record - and then declared his struggles this season had made him hungrier than ever for more success. Farah shattered Steve Ovett's 36-year-old British record over two miles at the Sainsbury's Birmingham Grand Prix on Sunday, powering home in eight minutes 07.85 seconds to blow the middle distance great's mark of 8mins 13.51secs out of the water. The double Olympic, world and European champion's time was also a European record. Miles ahead: Farah surges towards the finish, with none of his competitors anywhere to be seen . Record breaker: The Olympic champion beat Steve Ovett's record that has stood for 36 years . The 31-year-old's desire to add yet another record to his growing collection was clear as he pulled away from the field from way out and came home just shy of 15 seconds clear of his closest rival. Farah completed the 5,000 and 10,000 metres double at the European Championships in Zurich earlier this month, bouncing back from a torrid campaign which included a chastening marathon debut in London, where he finished eighth, and a frightening health scare which ruled him out of the Commonwealth Games. The Londoner, who was watched by his twin daughters, Aisha and Amani, on their second birthday, said: 'Early on I felt a bit tired and then as I got into it I just felt better and better. I kept looking at the clock and thinking, 'I can do it, I can do it'. He now holds the British record over 1500m, 5,000m, 10,000m and two miles outdoors and 3,000m, 5,000m and two miles indoors as well as the half marathon. It is some haul. He has one more race this season - the Great North Run next month - before taking a break ahead of focusing on the track, and the World Championships in Beijing, next year. Delight: Farah sinks to his knees after crossing the line to become the fastest ever European over two miles . Strain: The Brit pushed himself hard to break the record despite being practically unchallenged in the race . '(I'm) not thinking about the road or anything. I just want to get back on the track and get ready for the World Championships,' he said on his aims for 2015. 'When you're at the top it's harder. When you go through a struggle you are more determined, you want it more. 'Sometimes getting beaten or getting ill makes you want it more.' Certainly two more gold medals and another European record was hardly a bad return from a season which has run anything but smoothly. Lynsey Sharp was equally impressive in winning over 800m at the Diamond League meeting at Alexander Stadium. The Scot, silver medallist at the Commonwealths and Europeans, gained revenge on the Kenyan who pipped her to gold in Glasgow, the world champion Eunice Sum, finishing strongly to claim victory in 1:59.14. Sprint finish: Lynsey Sharp edges in front to win the 800m at the Diamond League Birmingham Grand Prix . The 24-year-old's achievements this year are nothing short of remarkable given the health and fitness issues she has had to cope with. She is due to undergo a third surgery at the end of September, the previous two operations to deal with a tendon problem in her left calf having left her with an open wound that requires twice-daily dressing. Her Commonwealth medal, meanwhile, came after being so sick the night before she was put on a drip. On the surgery, she said: 'They think there is an abscess of bad tissue inside so they need to take that out and make sure all the infection is gone before it closes up.' Celebration: The Scot looks delighted with her win, which rounds off an excellent few weeks . Told by doctors it was a 'fairly' serious procedure, Sharp said she was 'having nightmares about it'. 'We've got to get it right this time,' she added. 'We are arguing over the expected recovery time. I'm saying six weeks, they're saying four months, so we'll see.' If the problem is corrected, though, 2015 should be an exciting year, given Sharp ran a big personal best of 1:58.80 at the Europeans in Zurich. 'I love championship racing and I think with the worlds next year and the Olympics in 2016, to medal at them is probably the next aim,' she said. Elsewhere, world champion Christine Ohuruogu, who found herself in the unusual position of not being among the medals in Zurich, won the 400m in 51.40. In front: Ohoruogu put her European and Commonwealth disappointments behind her to win the 400m . Eilidh Child again had to settle for second to Kaliese Spencer, the Jamaican who beat her to the Commonwealth title, in the 400m hurdles. Greg Rutherford, who has added Commonwealth and European gold to his Olympic long jump crown this summer, finished fourth with a best leap of 8.04m. The effects of a gruelling season were evident for Martyn Rooney and Matthew Hudson-Smith, the gold and silver medallists over 400m at the European Championships, as they proved no match for Olympic champion Kirani James. Short: Rutherford could only jump 8.04m, leaving the Olympic, Commonwealth and European champion fourth . The 21-year-old from Grenada claimed a comfortable win in 44.59, with Rooney third in 45.25 and Hudson-Smith, on his home track, seventh and last in 46.60. David Rudisha missed out on a new world best in the rarely-run 600m, but still produced a dominant display of front-running to take the victory in 1:13.71.","Farah runs a time of eight minutes 7.85 seconds .

"An Oklahoma woman has been charged with child sex abuse and neglect for allegedly trying to molest an 11-year-old relative while keeping him in a filthy home. Alethea Montgomery, 40, from Piedmont, Oklahoma, was arrested Tuesday after the boy staying with her accused the woman of trying to force herself on him while under the influence of alcohol. When officers arrived at Montgomery's ranch-style house, the woman was reportedly so drunk that she was deemed unfit for questioning. Scroll down for video . Alethea Montgomery, 40, from Piedmont, Oklahoma, was arrested on child sex abuse and neglect charges after the 11-year-old boy staying with her accused the woman of trying to force him to touch her breasts . According to police, the 40-year-old and her young family member were living in deplorable conditions inside a home cluttered with trash and strewn with cat feces and beer cans. When responding officers opened Montgomery’s refrigerator, they found inside nothing but water, beer and spoiled milk. The 11-year-old accuser, who had been staying with Alethea Montgomery, told police that he’d gone for weeks without eating or bathing, the station KFOR reported. When interviewed by police, the child revealed that one day his 40-year-old caretaker entered his room in a drunken stupor, laid down on his bed and told him to come closer to her. Montgomery then allegedly instructed the child to touch her exposed breast, but the boy refused and tried to seek refuge behind a curtain. The inebriated woman then allegedly attempted to force the 11-year-old onto the bed, but he was able to get away and call for help. House of horrors: Responding officers entered Montgomery's house to discover mounds of trash, cat feces, empty beer cans everywhere and no food in the refrigerator . Under questioning, Ms Montgomery initially denied having any recollection of the incident, but suggested that perhaps she did something in her sleep. ‘He is not a liar and I do stuff in my sleep. I hope to God I didn’t do something, but if I did, I was asleep,’ she told police, according to an arrest report. The 40-year-old later changed her story, saying she believed her young relative and said she was sick to her stomach.","Alethea Montgomery, 40, charged with child sex abuse and neglect .

'And since majority of the people allows everything on their Android device, this is not much of a problem,' Bas Bosschert wrote on his blog. He outlined the steps needed - and even provided the code to do it. 'What do we need to steal someone's WhatsApp database? First we need a place to store the database,"" Bosschert explained. 'Next thing we need is an Android application which uploads the WhatsApp database to the website.' He also revealed how to add the required code to an existing app. 'By doing the magic in the loading screen you can also add this code to a real application instead of the Hello World message you see now.

Press: Tuttosport report that although Juventus do not want to let him go to United, Vidal talks are ongoing . Expensive taste: Vidal (right) carries a £30million price tag from the Serie A giants . Knee surgery last season prevented him playing for Juventus since the end of March, although he did he recover in time to feature for Chile at the World Cup.

"It has been suggested that geysers spurting out of Jupiter’s moon Europa may be an opportunity to spot alien life originating beneath the surface. This was based on observations by the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2013 that saw water vapour being ejected from the moon, lending evidence to the existence of jets. But now scientists are somewhat baffled as they have been unable to explain why follow-up observations have failed to spot the same geysers. In December 2013 the Hubble telescope spotted water vapour above Europa. But follow-up observations have failed to make the same observation. The vapour was thought to be a sign of plumes of liquid on the surface (illustration shown). Their disappearance is a mystery and several theories have been proposed . According to Mike Wall at Space.com, subsequent observations by Hubble in January and February of this year failed to spot the water vapour. This could be due to a lack of suitable conditions needed by Hubble to see the plumes, namely auroral emissions. It could also be that the explanation for where the water vapour came from, namely plumes on the surface, was incorrect. Jupiter's icy moon Europa is slightly smaller than Earth's Moon. Europa orbits Jupiter every 3.5 days and is tidally locked - just like Earth's Moon - so that the same side of Europa faces Jupiter at all times. It is thought to have an iron core, a rocky mantle and a surface ocean of salty water, like Earth. Unlike on Earth, however, this ocean is deep enough to cover the whole surface of Europa, and being far from the sun, the ocean surface is globally frozen over. Many experts believe the hidden ocean surrounding Europa, warmed by powerful tidal forces caused by Jupiter's gravity, may have conditions favourable for life. However Dr Kurt Retherford of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio told Space.com that he thought this was unlikely. ‘The best explanation still is plumes for that [December 2013] dataset, no doubt about it,’ he said. Another suggestion is that the plumes may be too small to see; indeed, even Cassini has struggled to spot vapour associated with the plumes being expelled into space. The previous evidence for the jets had come in the form of water vapour spotted by Hubble above Europa. Although several explanations were offered, Nasa was pretty sure this vapour was due to erupting plumes on the surface. Confirming the existence of the plumes and studying them further will be key to any future mission going to Europa. However these latest findings will need to be studied further to ensure they definitely are there. Dr Retherford and his team will be carrying out subsequent observations with Hubble from November this year to April 2015 to confirm that the jets exist. Dr Retherford tells Space.com that it is likely just due to suitable conditions not being present at the time of the repeated observations. But it could also more worrying be that the initial observation was incorrect. This image of Europa was taken by Voyager 2 in 1979 as it flew by the Jovian system .","In December 2013 the Hubble telescope spotted water vapour above Europa .

"When Caroline Wozniacki’s world came crashing down in May, her wedding plans suddenly and very publicly cancelled, she knew who she could turn to. Beyond her immediate family, one of the first people she called was Serena Williams, asking if she fancied to spend some party time together on Miami’s South Beach to help try and regroup after the shock. Serena, who was also going through a turbulent time with her coach/boyfriend Patrick Mouratoglou, agreed and the pair seemed to be content to be photographed hanging out together. Friendship: Serena Williams was there for Caroline Wozniacki after her split from Rory McIlroy . Shelved: While close off the court, all bets will be off when Wozniacki and Williams meet in the US Open final . Barely three months after offering mutual support they will on Sunday night contest the final of the US Open, with both pledging their friendship will be set aside as Wozniacki goes for her first Grand Slam title and Williams her 18th. The appearance in the final of the two means that eight different women have featured in the climaxes to the Major events in 2014. Billie Jean King, godmother of professional women’s tennis, sees this as a sign of the game’s health but is clear that she thinks Williams is about to end her barren spell in the Slams this season. Not only that, she also believes that, even approaching 33, the world No1 will one day pass Steffi Graf’s mark of 22 Major titles — she stands now on 17 and would equal Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert with victory. ‘Serena is the one to beat, she should win if she plays well. The main difference is her serve, although Caroline is doing a better job on her serve than she was, actually the biggest weakness in women’s tennis right now is the serve,' King says. Good humour: Wozniacki impersonates Williams at a charity match and the pair on holiday in Miami . ‘I think Serena will end up with many more than 18 — and 22, I can imagine her doing that. It’s up to her, whether she is willing to pay the price. I played until I was 40. She is a phenomenal athlete and gets a lot of free points on her serve.’ Frankly it will not say much for the depth in women’s tennis if Williams does get to 23 sometime in her mid-thirties. Like everyone, King, a remarkably strong character herself, much admires the way Wozniacki has bounced back from personal trauma this summer. ‘I think it’s very character revealing after the break up with Rory McIlroy what she has done. Taking up the [New York] marathon as well and doing it for charity. It shows how strong she really is. Going for it: Williams is playing for her 18th Grand Slam title on Sunday . Unfinished business: Although Wozniacki's been No 1 in the world, she's yet to win a major title . ‘They have both done well in their careers but I think Caroline is one of the greatest of people, she is very respectful and I take my hat off to her how she has handled everything. ‘In the final she has to go to the net when she can. She’s very good at defence so she has to maintain that and her serve has to hold up.’ It is the most fascinating backdrop to a women’s final in years, with one great champion trying to salvage what has been a difficult and deflating season, featuring dramas such as her dazed behaviour at Wimbledon. The challenger is being driven by something more than the desire to win, perhaps as McIlroy was when he went on his tear through the Majors. Europeans do not always get much support when tackling an American at Flushing Meadows, but even the most stone hearted New Yorker would struggle not to be somewhat torn about this. Billie Jean King will join Sir Elton John to stage Mylan World Team Tennis Smash Hits on finals day of the Statoil Masters Tennis tournament at the Royal Albert Hall on 7th December.

"When the hugs and high-fives with Chelsea’s players gave way to some solemn handshakes with his former Arsenal team-mates, Cesc Fabregas made his way towards the East Stand. It was there, just before he made his way into the lip of the tunnel, that the Chelsea midfielder looked up and blew kisses to the supporters celebrating inside Stamford Bridge. He is blue through and through now. Fabregas rose to the occasion, disciplining himself in the centre of Chelsea’s midfield and engineering their sixth win in the Barclays Premier League.

Tackles: 4 . Chances created: 3 . Assists: 1 . He set up Diego Costa’s goal in the 78th minute with the sweetest of lob wedges over Arsenal’s back-pedalling defence, rushing over to celebrate with the forward after he chested down and finished on the run. Fabregas is making this team tick, driving them on when he has Nemanja Matic, John Terry and Gary Cahill providing defensive security behind him. His seventh assist of a season that could finish with him crowned PFA player of the year was a beauty. To his credit he ignored the chants of Arsenal’s supporters in a corner of the Shed when he casually walked over to take a corner at the start of the second half. They were at their most provocative, with many pointing at him and chanting obscenities as he went to retrieve the ball behind the byline. Fabregas didn’t even look up. At least some applauded, remembering his contribution during eight years at Arsenal during which he never won anything more than the FA Cup in 2005 and the 2004 Community Shield. Fabregas (right) celebrates with Diego Costa after supplying the assist for Chelsea's second goal . The Chelsea star plays another accurate pass from midfield as Arsenal's Danny Welbeck watches on . Cesc Fabregas produced a masterful performance against his former club as Chelsea beat Arsenal 2-0 . There is no malice. ‘I have huge respect for Arsenal, they gave me everything when I was little,’ he admitted after he was named man of the match. ‘Without Arsenal I would not have won the things I have won and I understand the fans’ reaction. I know the fans love me. I’m not scared, they will be in my heart for ever. But now I’m at this fantastic club, playing with great players, with a great coach and great fans.’ Fabregas knew which way the wind was blowing when he returned to English football in the summer after three years with his boyhood team Barcelona. One meeting is all it took, a conversation with Jose Mourinho that convinced him the future was blue. He has made the right call. ‘To be fair, he didn’t give this performance because he had a special motivation against Arsenal,’ said Mourinho. This Daily Mail graphic shows how the deadly duo - Fabregas and Costa - combined to score Chelsea's second . Jack Wilshere and Fabregas share a word as they walk off at half-time . The Spanish midfielder showed a defensive steel to match his attacking guile at Stamford Bridge . ‘He’s been doing this from day one. He’s unbelievable. He showed he is very special and showed the professional he is. ‘To play against the team where he was made for football shows his commitment to us even more, as well as his professionalism.’ Fabregas looks at home here, settling into a rhythm and providing some creativity from midfield. There is a different feel to Chelsea. In the past they relied on Frank Lampard’s late runs into the area. Now it is all about the partnership between Fabregas and Costa. There were times when Fabregas could easily have reacted here, particularly when Danny Welbeck took him out in the final minutes. Although he winced and went down, he appeared to accept that this was the price to pay for turning his back. When he wakes up on Monday with some stiffness in his legs after a bruising encounter, he will know he made the right decision.

"Your success at playing a musical instrument could be down to a fatty substance in your brain. Scientists have discovered that an electrically insulating substance known as myelin is essential to our brains learning new skills. They claim that when a skill, such as playing the piano, is learned later in life, myelin must be made in order to retain the skill. Your success at playing a musical instrument could be down to a fatty substance in your brain. Scientists have discovered that an electrically insulating substance known as myelin is essential to our brains learning new skills. Pictured are close up images of myelinated nerve fibres. The myelin is shown in pink . However, researchers at University College London claim that once a new skill has been learnt, it is retained even after myelin production stops. They found myelin was produced by the brain and spinal cord into early adulthood as it is needed for many developmental processes. Although earlier studies of white matter hinted at its involvement in skill learning, the study is the first to confirm it experimentally. Lab mice tests showed that new myelin must be made each time a skill is learned later in life and the structure of the brain's white matter changes during new practical activities by increasing the number of myelin-producing cells. Scientists at University College London claim that when a skill, such as playing the piano, is learned later in life myelin must be made in order to retain the skill. Once a new skill has been learnt, it is retained even after myelin production stops. These discoveries could prove important in finding ways to stimulate and improve learning, and in understanding myelin's involvement in other brain processes such as in cognition, the study published in Science suggested. When a child learns to walk or an adult masters a new skill such as juggling, new brain circuit activity is needed and new connections are made across large distances and at high speeds between different parts of the brain and spinal cord. Myelin is a fatty material that coats and insulates nerves. It is sometimes compared to the insulating material around an electrical wire. Its job is to quickly conduct impulses between the brain and different parts of the body. The result is faster reactions to danger and a better chance of survival. It is made up of around 40 per cent water, while its dry mass is around 20 per cent protein. Flaws in making myelin result in a number of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). For this, electrical signals fire between neurons connected by 'axons' - thread-like extensions of their outer surfaces which can be viewed as the 'wire' in the electric circuit. When new signals fire repeatedly along axons, the connections between the neurons strengthen, making them easier to fire in the same pattern in future. Neighbouring myelin-producing cells called oligodendrocytes (OLs) recognise the repeating signal and wrap myelin around the active circuit wiring. It is this activity-driven insulation that the team identified as essential for learning. But while the study showed young adult mice need to make myelin to learn new motor skills, new myelin does not need to be produced to recall and perform a pre-learned skill. The theory was established when normal mice and mice which had their their ability to produce OLs and myelin switched off were made to run on an irregular spaced wheel. The 'abnormal' mice could not master the wheel. These discoveries could prove important in finding ways to stimulate and improve learning, and in understanding myelin's involvement in other brain processes such as in cognition, the study published in Science suggested. Pictured is an electron micrograph of myelin sheath . But when 'normal' mice used the wheel but were then switched off, they could still master the wheel. Professor Bill Richardson, Director of the Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, said: 'From earlier studies of human white matter using advanced MRI technology, we thought OLs and myelin might be involved in some way in skill learning, so we decided to attack this idea experimentally. 'We were surprised how quickly we saw differences in the ability of mice from each group to learn how to run on complex wheel, which shows just how fast the brain can respond to wrap newly-activated circuits in myelin and how this improves learning. 'This rapid response suggests that a number of alternative axon pathways might already exist in the brain that could be used to drive a particular sequence of movements, but it quickly works out which of those circuits is most efficient and both selects and protects its chosen route with myelin. 'We think these findings are really exciting as they open up opportunities to investigate the role of OLs and myelin in other brain processes, such as cognitive activities like navigating through a maze, to see if the requirement for new myelin is general or specific to motor activity. 'I'm keen to find out the precise sequence of changes to OLs and myelin during learning and whether these changes are needed more in some parts of the brain than others, which might shed light on some of the mysteries still surrounding how the brain adapts and learns throughout life.'","Myelin is a protein-rich fatty material that coats and insulates nerves .

"The UK Independence Party is set to win its first parliamentary seat tomorrow as voters were poised to deliver a bloody nose to both the Tories and Labour. Douglas Carswell, the former Tory MP who defected to UKIP this summer is expected to hold his seaside constituency of Clacton in Essex by a landslide. Polls have put him on course to win up to 6,000 more votes than the Conservatives, in what is set to be a humiliating by-election defeat for David Cameron. Scroll down for video . Douglas Carswell, who defected from the Tories in August, was campaigning in Clacton today, where he hopes to become UKIP's first elected MP . In the town centre Mr Carswell received a hug from supporter Asma Jackson as polls suggest he will secure a majority over the Tories of up to 6,000 . Labour are expected to cling on in the northern seat of Heywood and Middleton, where another by-election was triggered by the death of local MP Jim Dobbin. But UKIP, who have made political capital out of child abuse scandals in nearby Rochdale and Rotherham and fears about immigration, are set to run them a close second, which would raise more concerns about Ed Miliband's leadership. Mr Cameron has all but conceded the Conservatives cannot win Clacton, which has high unemployment and contains the most deprived ward in the country. The Prime Minister made a last ditch visit to the seat last week, and acknowledged the Tories were 'the underdogs'. The Conservative candidate fighting Mr Carswell is Giles Watling, an actor best known for his appearance as the vicar in the 1980s sitcom 'Bread', who is from the area and has been a local councillor for several years. A few cabinet ministers and MPs have visited the seaside town in recent weeks to campaign, but the party largely held back in order to throw more resources at the next by-election in Rochester and Strood, in Kent, next month triggered by the defection of fellow Tory MP Mark Reckless. Mr Reckless has a small lead in the polls, but the Conservatives believe they can hold it, and will head there on Friday afternoon after the Clacton result to campaign. Mr Cameron said they would 'throw everything we can' at keeping the seat. Securing the first seat in the Commons will mark a major breakthrough for UKIP, with leader Nigel Farage hoping it will act as a springboard for other wins at the general election . Tory candidate Giles Watling, a former actor in 1980s sitcom bread, was joined on the campaign rail today by Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude . Labour have approached the northern by-election tonight with increasing panic amid concerns that Ed Miliband is not in touch with the voters about immigration. One MP said yesterday that if UKIP finished within 2,000 votes of Labour there 'alarm bells would start ringing' about Mr Miliband. The MP, who did not wish to be named, said it would suggest that the direction of the party 'was not one that was appealing to our core voters'. A study last week found that the UKIP surge could prevent Labour taking dozens of Tory target seats at the next election. John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said Labour was not doing enough to address the UKIP threat in many northern, working-class seats. Mr Mann said: 'Labour needs to squeeze the space that UKIP is trying to squeeze into, which is attracting low-paid working class voters and their concerns, which are pay, immigration and the NHS. If we don't, we won't win – it's as simple as that.' 'That voice isn't represented in Labour's policies. It's a fundamental weakness and if Ed Miliband wants to become Prime Minister he needs to address that.' UKIP are also hoping for a strong showing in the by-election in Heywood and Middleton, where Nigel Farage campaigned yesterday, climbing on to a tank for the cameras . Ed Miliband met local people today in Heywood, where Labour is expected to win the by-election triggered by the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin . Senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said all mainstream parties are set to be punished at the ballot box, because they are not listening to real people's concerns. Mrs Hodge, MP for Barking, which caused shockwaves in 2006 by electing a dozen BNP councillors said: 'People are moving away to UKIP, the BNP or the SNP as a protest vote against the mainstream political parties not connecting with the electorate. Trust is in danger of breaking down.' Kent and Essex are key areas where Labour must pick up marginal seats if they want to win the next general election. But in Clacton, which Labour held under Tony Blair with different boundaries when it was known as Harwich, their vote is set to be squeezed by UKIP. Labour managed to poll 25 per cent of the vote in Clacton in 2010 at the height of Gordon Brown's unpopularity and their vote share is predicted to drop this time. Yesterday, local councillor Tim Young claimed yesterday that immigration is 'not an issue' in the area 'in terms of numbers' as there are few migrants there. He added: 'I think it's being stoked up a bit by what UKIP are saying. But it isn't the first issue that comes up on the doorstep. That's been the NHS and street lights.'","UKIP on course to deliver a bloody nose to the Conservatives and Labour .

"Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler has applied to become the next Leeds manager. The Championship side are seeking a new boss after sacking Dave Hockaday after just six games. The 39-year-old has been pushed forward for the vacant post at Elland Road by intermediaries and owner Massimo Cellino is due back from a break in USA on Wednesday to consider all applicants. Heading back to Leeds? Robbie Fowler has put forward his application for the Leeds United job . Taking lessons: Fowler, pictured with Ian Rush (centre) and Brendan Rodgers, has coaching experience at Liverpool but is now ready to take on his first managerial job in England . Cellino sacked Dave Hockaday after just six games but Fowler, who had a spell playing for Leeds between 2001 and 2003, is undeterred. The former Liverpool striker had a spell as player-coach with Muangthong United in Thailand and has been coaching at Liverpool alongside Steve McManaman and Rob Jones but is ready to take on a number one management role. Academy manager Neil Redfearn has been placed in temporary charge of Leeds' first team ahead of Saturday's game with Birmingham City and Cellino said he has 'not heard of anyone better to look after the team', however, Redfearn is understood to have reservations about taking the role full-time. Hotshot: Fowler signed for Leeds as a player in 2001 following an £11million move from Liverpool . Short spell: Fowler spent two years at Elland Road in the Premier League, scoring 14 goals in 30 league games . Steve Clarke, Tony Mowbray and Chris Hughton have also expressed an interest with Cellino keen to appoint a British coach. Hughton, who was sacked as Norwich City manager last season, said: 'There are lots of challenges out there and Leeds United is very much a challenge. I’m very keen to get back in at the right club.'

"A seven-year-old Salvadoran cancer sufferer has finally been released from an immigrant detention center in Texas so that she can get treatment for her brain tumor after weeks of delays. Following uproar from advocacy groups, Nayely Bermudez Beltran and her mother, Sara Beltran Rodriguez, were allowed to leave the Karnes County Residential Center on Wednesday night so that the little girl can undergo treatment next week. The duo fled violence in El Salvador in July and when they entered the U.S., Beltran immediately told border patrol officers that the girl needed medical attention, the Houston Chronicle reported. But they were transferred to the center in Karnes County without Nayely undergoing any treatment - and even though they had a place to stay, authorities would not release them or set bail,Grassroots Leadership explained. Relief: Nayely Bermudez Beltran and her mother, Sara, grin after they are released from an immigrant detention center on Wednesday - allowing the seven-year-old girl to undergo treatment for her brain tumor . Brave: The little girl had previously undergone chemotherapyfor her brain tumor in El Salvador but she had to stop her treatments when she and her mother fled the violence in their home city . As the mother and daughter awaited answers, the youngster became increasingly ill and started wetting the bed because of her condition, Beltran said. Nayely also previously had a shunt put in her brain during surgery in El Salvador and it could have malfunctioned at any time, killing her or leaving her brain damaged, according to their lawyer. 'We were waiting for a month, and no one would do anything,' Beltran, 27, said. 'I felt anguished.' Finally, on August 18, the duo passed a credible fear screening - the first hurdle towards asylum - but authorities still would not release the youngster for treatment, Grassroots Leadership said. Their lawyer, Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, who is representing them pro bono, was able to obtain the girl's medical records and they were evaluated by three U.S. doctors. Concern: After reviewing Nayely's medical records, Austin-based Dr. Simon Carlson (pictured) urged customs to release the little girl, saying that she could die or be left brain damaged if not treated immediately . Fighters: The mom and daughter, pictured on Wednesday, were helped by immigrant advocacy groups . One of the doctors, neurologist Dr. Simon Carlson, urged ICE to release the girl, saying that her health could 'take a turn for the worse with little to no forewarning, with devastating outcomes'. 'Urgent care is needed for this child, and she is likely to suffer long term brain damage or worse if left to routine care without urgent specialist intervention,' he said. On Wednesday, the agency finally released the pair and they went to a shelter in Austin, according to Texans United for Families, which helped fight for their release. Photographs taken outside the shelter show the mother and daughter grinning with their lawyer. 'Nayely and Sara just walked out of the Karnes family detention center,' the caption read. 'They are on their way to a warm and welcoming place in Austin and Nayely is going to see a doctor on Tuesday.' Detained: They had been held at the Karnes County Residential Center (pictured), a new center in Texas, even though they said Nayely required urgent medical attention. Weeks later, they have finally left . The Houston Chronicle reported that it is unclear exactly what made the agency change its mind. Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas in Austin has agreed to evaluate Nayely next week - and might even cover the costs. Beltran and her daughter are also scheduled for a hearing on Thursday. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not comment on the case.","Nayely Bermudez Beltran and her mother Sara were forced to flee El Salvador in July amid violence and came to the U.S.

"The first pictures have emerged of a U.S. bomber lost over Siberia during the Second World War after its wreckage was found this summer. The Douglas A-20 Havoc (DB-7) was loaned to Stalin under the World War II Lend-Lease programme but it crashed in 1943 en route from Alaska to the eastern front in Europe. The crew of four is believed to have died when the aircraft hit the ground. Scroll down for video . The wreckage of the plane was a chance discovery by a team working on an unrelated project in the area . The plane was located in July in a pristine and remote mountainous area of Kemerovo region's 4,129 square kilometre Kuznetsky Alatau wildlife reserve. A hunter in the remote taiga had reported seeing the plane as long ago as 1966 but could not retrace his steps or explain its location. This year the reserve's director Alexey Vasilchenko, 52, found the plane while on an unrelated research trip. One large part of the wreckage is plainly visible from the air on a ridge on Zelyonaya mountain, which makes it surprising that it was not located sooner, despite the remoteness of its location. 'Remains of the crew were not found,' the reserve's spokesman Nadezhda Eliseeva told The Siberian Times. However, the plane's identification number F216 was visible on its fuselage, which leads to hope that the names of the crew of four who perished in the crash can be identified. The Douglas A-20 Havoc (DB-7) was loaned to Stalin under the World War II Lend-Lease programme but it crashed in 1943 en route from Alaska to the eastern front in Europe . 'The wreckage was discovered during research on other work. It was a chance discovery in the north of the reserve,' she said. The aircraft had 'crashed to pieces with fragments of the plane covering a large area'. The plane was one of 3,400 such aircraft supplied by the US to the Soviet air force as the Allies sought to restrain Hitler. One large part of the wreckage is plainly visible from the air on a ridge on Zelyonaya mountain, which makes it surprising that it was not located sooner, despite the remote location . The aircraft was a light-bomber, attack and night-fighter. The first planes were built in the 1930s and were one of the first American aircraft to serve in World War II. The majority of Havocs served with the Soviets, but the US and Great Britain also used the planes. It was known as a relatively easy plane to fly with good handling during takeoff and landing. The Havoc also represented an advance in flight control systems with light handling during high-speed flight . 'When the team noticed big fragments of the plane, they said that it was hard to understand how previous expeditions failed to find them,' said Ms Eliseeva. 'As they walked towards the big parts of the aircraft, they saw and picked up smaller fragments strewn on the ground. 'They were surprised to see that the plane's metal had not lost its shine after so many years of harsh Siberian weather. 'The main thing they managed to detect was the plane's tail number which was F216.' The reason for the crash is not known. There were no hostilities in this part of Russia and the most likely explanation is seen as the plane losing its bearings in poor weather as it crossed mountainous terrain. No decision has been made yet on what will happen to the aircraft wreck. One option is to exhibit some parts in the reserve's museum. During the Second World War - known as the Great Patriotic War to Russians - the USSR received more than $11 billion worth of military equipment and other supplies from the United States. The plane was located in July in a pristine and remote mountainous area of Kemerovo region's 4,129 square kilometre Kuznetsky Alatau wildlife reserve .","Douglas A-20 Havoc (DB-7) crashed in 1943 en route  to the eastern front .

"When Burger King decided to give its U.S. menu a . revamp, the fast food chain unveiled a new lower-calorie selection, designed to . lure in health conscious customers. The new menu is being promoted in their biggest marketing campaign to date, but although English football star David Beckham features in a glossy advert - the menu will not be offered to British customers. The fast food chain has decided that only . the U.S, will enjoy their upgraded menu and Britain and the rest of the world, have been left . sidelined. One rule for them: The new Burger King menu has been promoted in the company's  biggest marketing campaign to date, but the menu will only be offered to American outlets, left, not British customers, right . A Burger King spokesperson said the new menu 'was a U.S. focused campaign.' 'There . are currently no plans to introduce the referenced products launched in . the U.S. in the UK, as they have been developed based on US customer . research,' he explained. Burger King started in Miami in 1954, and has since expanded to 72 countries worldwide. Star promotion: Although English football star David Beckham features in a glossy advert , but that is where the British elements of the new menu end . Very clever marketing: Beckham was selected to spearhead a new Burger King commercial specifically advertising the fast food chain's new healthy smoothie . The fast-food chain defended its . decision saying that 'in the UK, Burger King and it’s franchisees offer a . number of healthy options on its menu, 'including the sweet chili . chicken wrap at 296 calories and our hamburger at 260 calories and 4g of . fat.' The decision to focus on the U.S. could be down to the need to focus on competition -  Burger King is no . longer the nearest challenger to McDonald's among the U.S. burger chains. It has fallen into third place behind Wendy's, according to researcher Technomic. But outside of the U.S. Burger King has significantly more restaurants than Wendy's, so does not look like it will lose its . position as the global No2.

Over the past year, Burger King . evaluated all of its ingredients from the bacon to the cheese slices it . serves on its char-grilled burgers as part of a year long quest to . reverse years of slumping sales of its Whoppers and fries. The . result is a changed menu which features frappe coffees, chicken strips . and snack wraps- all of which have been heavily promoted at McDonalds . for years at this point. The . Golden Arches already rolled out speciality salads in 2003, snack wraps . in 2006, premium coffee drinks in 2009, and fruit smoothies in 2010. ‘Being . an innovator is critical in the fast-food industry,’ said Darren . Tristano, an analyst for food industry researcher Technomic Inc. But in recent years, he said Burger King has been more of a follower. Burger . King executives don't deny that its new items are pretty close to those . on McDonald's popular menu. But they say the new menu was created as a . result of Burger King's own research. ‘Consumers wanted more choices,’ said Steve Wiborg, president of Burger King's North America operations. ‘Not just healthy choices, but choices they could get at the competition.’ The 10 new items mark Burger King's biggest menu expansion since the chain opened its doors in 1954. Concerns over obesity have paved the way for competitors like Subway, . now the second-biggest chain, and Starbucks, which climbed up the . rankings to the No. 3 spot. After . much resistance, the attitude from the bosses at Burger King . changed after New York-based private equity firm 3G Capital bought . Burger King last year. Leader: McDonald's was the first of the fast food chains to expand their menu to include healthier options . That's . when Burger King assembled a group of 15 key executives, franchisees . and suppliers to evaluate the chain's menu, item by item. To get the word out about the changes, Burger King is rolling out its biggest marketing campaign ever.

"Challenger? Liz Kendall, a favourite of Labour's Blairite wing, is widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May . Blairite MP Liz Kendall is being widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May, it emerged yesterday. The Leicester West MP is a member of a ‘breakfast club’ quartet of frontbenchers along with shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds, and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. All four were elected in 2010 and have been meeting in Portcullis House before meetings of Mr Miliband’s shadow cabinet. Many MPs from the 2010 intake are keen to move on from the Blair/Brown wars of the past if Labour doesn’t win in May. A clean break from the past would see one of their number challenging for the leadership against several former ministers. Other challengers are likely to include Andy Burnham, the party’s shadow health secretary who made what was widely seen as the best speech at Labour conference last year. Mr Burnham’s popularity among party members has surged on the back of his passionate campaign to protect the NHS from further privatisation. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper is also widely seen as a potential candidate in the event of a Labour loss. Her husband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost heavily. Yesterday the Independent on Sunday reported Miss Kendall, a Leicester MP, had emerged as the favourite among Blairites impressed by her TV performances. It was also suggested that the quartet of Blairites will unite to try and block Mr Burnham, and suggested Mr Umunna would also be a likely candidate. Other Labour MPs are said to prefer the prospect of a joint ticket involving Mr Hunt and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves. Last week Miss Kendall raised eyebrows by challenging Mr Miliband’s position on the private sector providing free NHS services, declaring: ‘What matters is what works’. Her tone was markedly different from that of both Mr Miliband and Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham. Miss Kendall, 43, also defended middle-class voters with ‘sharp elbows’ who demand the best from public services. She said: ‘I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making sure that our NHS needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else.’ 'Breakfast club': Miss Kendall is a member of a quartet of Blairite MPs along with, from left, education spokesman Tristram Hunt, business spokesman Chuka Umunna, housing spokesman Emma Reynolds . Mr Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, while Mr Burnham has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed. But in an interview with political magazine The House, Miss Kendall insisted: ‘There will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenges to the system. I believe what matters is what works.’","Leicester West MP was only elected to the Commons in 2010 .

"A Minnesota cop decapitated a boy's pet chicken and in a cruel mistake left the head outside the coop, where the owner's mother later found it. Atwater Police Chief Trevor Berger beat and killed the chicken with a shovel at the home of Ashley Turnbull on August 16 after a neighbor complained about the fowl. 'I came home to find the chicken’s head lying in front of its coop,' Turnbull told the Star Tribune. 'No note left on the door. He just left the head.' Family pet: Ashley Turnbull says her son, five-year-old Phoenix, treated his chicken, Carson Petey, as if it were a puppy . The . small red hen, named Carson Petey, belonged to Turnbull's son Phoenix. The boy would shuttle the it around the yard in a toy wagon, according . to Turnbull, who told Minnesota Public Radio, 'the chicken was like a puppy dog to my son.'

"A team of Swiss designers have developed a rocking chair that can transform energy from its rocking motion to charge an iPad or iPhone. Built according to the classic, proven rocking chair design, the seat - which its makers have dubbed the iRock - uses a built-in generator that transforms gentle swaying into electricity. Handcrafted from Swedish pine, it is styled with all the traditional features you would expect from a rocking chair but also comes equipped with an iPad stand. iRock: This rocking chair which charges your iPad as you use it is the brainchild of a Swiss design team . Perfect for the older iFan: The owner's iPad rests conveniently on a stand built in to the chair's armrest . An updated classic: The iRock comes complete with stereo speakers built into the backrest . The backrest of the painted wood rocking chair also features built-in speakers, presumably to pelt out Radio 3 or Vera Lynn videos from YouTube. Its makers claim that just an hour of easy swaying will charge your iPad to 35 per cent, and it is also compatible with other Apple devices - although publicity pictures suggest it uses the old-style connector. The chair uses a winding mechanism combined with a set of gears to create enough force to drive the generator, which the development team says was a challenge to make energy efficient enough for practical use. Now, however, they believe the same mechanism could be used to fit power generation mechanisms to doors, draws and stairs.

Obsolete already? Publicity pictures suggest the iRock ships with the old-style Apple connector - which means an adaptor would be needed for the latest generation of iDevices . The chair is still in development, but Micasa Lab, the Zurich-based design studio behind the chair, give it an estimated retail price of €1,300 (£1,038) - pretty steep for most pensioners. Its makers say: 'The amount of technical gadgets we have learned to depend on has increased dramatically the last couple of years. 'The iRock is an product that explores how furniture can interact with technology and actually support the power for this technology.

"Walking free: Genene Jones, 64, will be released from prison in February 2018 . A pediatric nurse who allegedly murdered more than 40 infants in the 1980s and was sent to prison for 99 years is up for parole this week. The parole board will almost certainly vote to keep Genene Jones behind bars. But no matter what the board does, she will walk free in less than four years. 'She's probably going to be the first serial killer in this country's history to be legally released,' Andy Kahan, a Houston crime victim advocate told KHOU-TV. Jones, now age 64, is suspected of murdering dozens of infants by injecting them with a combination of drugs at two hospitals in San Antonio and Kerrville, Texas, between 1971 and 1984. Some estimates say she killed as many as 46 children. However, she was only convicted of two crimes - the murder of 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan and the attempted murder of Rolando Jones, who was 18 months old at the time. Her 99-year prison sentence was reduced by one third because of Texas sentencing laws at the time. She was put away in 1985. She is scheduled to be released in February 2018. Authorities have only one recourse - to find new evidence and convict her of a new crime related to the 30-year-old murders. However, hospital records of the infant deaths were destroyed long ago. Prosecutors at the time tried to find the evidence to charge her with additional infant deaths - but only had the grounds to pursue he two cases that sent Jones to prison. 'This is an individual who should never be out of prison,' Bexar County District Attorney Susan Reed said. Ms Reed is spear-heading the effort to dig up new leads. With the help of Mr Kahan, Ms Reed is pursuing a strategy to kept another serial killer from being released.Coral Watts was due to be released in 2006, despite having confessed to killing 13 women in the Houston area in 2006. A massive public campaign led a new witness to come forward that allowed him to be convicted of a new murder - which kept him behind bars until his death in 2007. Jones was only convicted of one murder and one attempted murder  - despite suspicions that she murdered up to 46 infants while working at two Texas hospitals .","Genene Jones was only convicted of killing one infant, though is believed to have murdered dozens .

"From 'gutter oil' to glow-in-the-dark pork, Chinese cuisine has been hit by a series of stomach-turning food scandals. Now one Beijing firm claims it could put a stop to dodgy food practices with its latest gadget: smart chopsticks that detect contamination. Called Kuaisou in Chinese, the chopsticks were first created as joke by the company, Baidu, in an April Fool's video. Scroll down for video . Called Kuaisou in Chinese, the chopsticks were first created as joke by the company, Baidu, in an April Fool's video. The latest stage of development was revealed this week by Baidu CEO, Robin Li (pictured) Baidu at the time had 'no serious intention of actually pursuing this', the spokesman told AFP of the stunt it released earlier this year. 'But it generated a lot of excitement both internally and externally.' The latest stage of development was revealed this week, with a new video released by the company showing a user placing the electronic chopsticks in three different cups of cooking oil. Sensors in the chopsticks detect the oil's temperature and its suitabilty for consumption, with the findings displayed on a smartphone app. Sensors detect the oil's temperature and its suitabilty for consumption, with the findings displayed on an app . The chopsticks flash a red light when cooking oil has a higher than 25 per cent level of TPMs, or total polar materials, an indicator of freshness, the spokesman said. Poor food safety is a major concern in China, with one of the country's worst food scandals seeing the industrial chemical melamine illegally added to dairy products in 2008. The chemical killing six children and made 300,000 people ill. 'Gutter oil' is a particular concern - cooking oil illegally made by reprocessing waste oil or by dredging up leftovers from restaurants and marketing it as new.

'Gutter oil' is a particular concern - cooking oil illegally made by reprocessing waste oil or by dredging up leftovers from restaurants and marketing it as new. Health authorities last year launched a crackdown on the use and manufacture of such oil, with more than 100 people arrested and 20 imprisoned - two of them for life - as part of the campaign. Other scandals include glow-in-the dark pork, aluminium dumplings, pesticide-drenched ‘yard-long’ beans and toxic bean sprouts.

In another scandal several years ago, photographs surfaced showing pork that glowed an eerie, iridescent blue when the kitchen lights were turned off. It is thought that they were contaminated by a phosphorescent bacteria that regulators claims was still safe eat if well-cooked. Baidu said it was not clear whether the 'smart chopsticks' would go into commercial production. The company has only made a limited run of prototypes, the spokesman said, and no release date or price has been set. China's social media users applauded the company's innovation,  but were critical of the need for the device in the first place. 'Is it really a good thing that they invented these?' wrote one user. 'Can we still enjoy our food?' 'If I carried these chopsticks around with me everywhere, I think I'd die of hunger,' wrote another.

"Despite the best efforts of Cristiano Ronaldo and co, style, says photographer Giuseppe Santamaria, is about much more than owning the latest trainers or an expensive suit. Instead, he says, it's all about expression and staying true to yourself. If that sounds baffling, then the street style specialist's new book, Men In This Town, ought to help. Packed with glossy photos of Sydney, London, Milan and New York's most stylish men, the dapper gents pictured have little in common with Ronaldo and his wardrobe of garish Gucci. Scroll down for video . A tale of two cities: A stylish New Yorker in a homburg (left) while a Londoner offers a modern twist on tradition . Instead, there's the New York businessman in grey tweed, a brown fedora, stylish sunnies and a natty pocket square, and the East London hipster who manages to make an eye-wateringly bright pair of mustard cords and a patterned shirt look achingly cool. Others are dapper in classic homburg hats and trench coats, neat striped blazers and cream chinos and even, in one case, manage to breathe new life into the well-worn pale blue shirt and jeans combo. There's little to tie the men together, apart, that is, from confidence. 'The main thing that catches my eye when . I’m out taking photos is confidence,' adds Santamaria. 'It’s in how someone holds . themselves when they think nobody is looking. If you got that, you’ll . stand out on the street, even if you’re not trying to.' Time for a makeover: Cristiano Ronaldo's blingy approach to dressing is proof that money can't buy style . Makeover: The traditional jeans and cotton shirt combo is given an overhaul by this pair of dapper gents . But style, of the fashionable kind, is something that Santamaria knows well. Born in Toronto, the photographer and art director lived in New York before moving to Sydney and has worked on campaigns for Nespresso and Peroni, as well as on editorial features for GQ Australia and many more. As a result, he's got a few style ideas of his own although they do boil down into one key commandment: wear what you love. 'Don’t follow the trends too much,' he adds, wisely. 'If you . do, have fun with them but add something unique to the look that . express’ something about you. Keep it individual.' With such emphasis on individuality, it's no surprise that one of his favourite cities to snap is London, where, in trendy areas such as Shoreditch, locals can be seen wearing anything from silver skirts to skinny jeans. Tailoring: As these gentlemen demonstrate, the classic pale chino and blazer combination never gets dull . Urban cool: The tailored trouser gets a gritty makeover (left) and a masterclass in wearing colour (right) 'I loved shooting the streets of London,' he enthuses. 'I . love the sense of tradition yet done with such a modern spin. London men . are very much into what’s going on in fashion and stay on top of it.' That doesn't mean, however, that he doesn't love the scene in Sydney and New York. 'Men’s style is Sydney is very eclectic,' he muses. 'It’s a city where men on the mainstream are finally starting to . experiment with fashion. It’s a time of experimentation and trying new . things, which is leading to some flamboyant looks.' And New York? New York, he says, is both fun and trend focused. 'The men of New York have the most fun . with fashion I think. 'It’s where trends appear on the . streets, resulting in a more urban and cool look. New York is the land . of big box stores but the guys know how to make their style unique.'

"The one-time lawyer and closest confidant of legendary 'Tonight Show' host Johnny Carson has revealed the moment the notoriously mercurial star broke down in tears when he discovered his wife was allegedly cheating on him. Having been roped into breaking and entering the secret Manhattan apartment of Joanne Copeland, Carson's second wife, attorney Henry Bushkin and the entertainer discovered a virtual shrine of photographs to pro-footballer Frank Gifford - confirming Carson's greatest fears. As Carson began to weep, Bushkin, who was aged only 27 during the clandestine 1970 raid recalls that the multi-millionaire television host's raincoat had fallen open to reveal a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip. In Happier Times: Johnny Carson and his bride, actress-model Joanne Copeland, are shown after their marriage in August 1963 and at home in 1968 . Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny Carson', that charts the 18-years he worked for the comedian as his lawyer, wingman, fixer and closest confidant and hits bookshelves on October 15th. Indeed, the pair were great friends and Carson frequently referred to him as 'Bombastic Bushkin' in many of his opening monologues on 'The Tonight Show'. Recalling how Carson, who during the 70s and 80s was the nation's highest-paid entertainer, co-opted him into the break in, Bushkin says that his boss said, 'I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me.' 'I also have an idea who the son-of-b***h' is that she's shacking up with'. Football Figurehead: NFL superstar Frank Gifford poses for a picture in his New York Giants sportswear in 1963 . Sportsman and Commentator: Frank Gifford, husband of Kathy Lee Gifford, the TV personality in 1967 and (right) in his heyday . Carson had married Joanne Copeland on August 17th, 1963, but by 1970 he suspected that she was having an affair with retired NFL player Frank Gifford - famed for his exploits on the field, as a commentator and today as the husband of 'Today' show host Kathy Lee Gifford. Indeed, the two men were arguably as famous as each other at the end of the 1960s. While Carson spent thirty years as host of 'The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson' from 1962 to 1992, in 1970, Frank Gifford was poised to become host of ABC's 'Monday Night Football'. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Gifford, 83, was an NFL Champion in 1956 with the New York Giants, an eight-time Pro-Bowl selection and his #16 Jersey for the Giants is retired. While the events that Bushkin recalls took place a full 16-years before Gifford married Kathryn Lee Epstein, Bushkin is adamant about how that secretive break-in turned out. Approaching the apartment on the East Forties of Manhattan near First Avenue, Buskkin says that Carson was accompanied by Joe Mullen, a licensed New York private eye, lock-picker Mario Irizarry and Arthur Kassel 'a security expert/crime photographer/police groupie.' Loved Across The Nation: In this undated photo provided by NBC, Johnny Carson begins an episode of the ""Tonight Show"" as ""Carnac, The Magnificent!"" Bushkin recalls standing in the rain outside the apartment thinking that as a 27-year-old recent graduate of Vanderbilt Law University he was about to break the law, not uphold it. Johnny Carson was best known for his 30 years from 1962 to 1992 as host of the 'The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'He dominated American light entertainment and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992His influence extends to the current crop of late-night hosts such as his successor Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and he was a particular hero to David LettermanAn article in The New Yorker by Kenneth Tynan from 1978, included the following question and answer:Tynan: 'When you're at home, whom do you entertain?""Carson: 'My lawyer, Henry Bushkin, who's probably my best friend.'Henry Bushkin was Carson's lawyer of 18 years. Until their falling out in 1988, the two remained business partners and great friendsHe died in January 2005 . 'Johnny looked over at me. 'Don’t worry, kid,' he said reassuringly. 'Nothing’s going to happen to you. Trust me,' writes Bushkin in an extract published by Entertainment Weekly. Joanne was Johnny Carson's second wife. His first, Jody, was a childhood sweetheart and together they had three sons, Chris, Ricky and Cory. However, as Johnny's fame grew and the temptations around him grew stronger, Carson's first marriage failed and ended in divorce in 1963. Indeed, within months of this he married Joanne, a former flight attendant who had once worked briefly as a hostess on television for the game show called 'Video Village'. However, seven years later, Bushkin recalls standing outside the apartment about to essentially break-in and enter to prove her infidelity. Bushkin, who now splits his time between Los Angeles and New York writes that he suggested an ingenious defense for the gang should they be caught inside the home. 'Let me ask you,' I said, 'does Mrs. Carson have any money of her own?' 'No, not really,' Johnny replied. 'Then let me suggest that you have been the person who has been paying for this apartment. So arguably it’s your apartment.' Final Show: In this Friday, May 22, 1992 file photo, talk show host Johnny Carson, behind his desk, Doc Severinsen, left, leader of ""The Tonight Show Band"", and announcer Ed McMahon, sit during the final taping of the ""Tonight Show"" Managing through bluff and a little bribing to get the building manager to let them into the apartment, the team realized on entering that the apartment was filled with furniture discarded from Joanne and Carson's luxury UN Plaza Apartment. Honoree Kathie Lee Gifford (L) and husband Frank Gifford attend the City of Hope-East End Chapter 2010 Spirit of Life Award luncheon at Waldorf Astoria - Grand Ballroom on April 26, 2010 in New York City . This was before 1972 when Carson and 'The Tonight Show' made the decision to relocate to Burbank, California. Having gained entry to the apartment that Copeland was leasing without her husband's knowledge, Carson and Bushkin discovered 'six or seven framed photographs' and the 'Tonight Show' stalwart did not take the news well. 'Carson leaned against the living room wall and began to weep,' writes Bushkin in his memoir. 'I could see that Carson's raincoat had fallen open. I was shocked to see that Johnny was carrying a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip.' 'Here’s Johneeeeee…..' I realized,' Bushkin writes, 'that I was probably one of the very few people who ever saw Johnny Carson cry.' 'Across the room, the silent Joe Mullen deftly swept some lingerie under the sofa with the toe of his shoe. He wanted to spare Johnny the sight. There was little else that could be done.' 'Joanne has broken my heart,' Carson told Bushkin, 'to the extent I ever had one.' Later that evening, Bushkin says that a drunk Carson phoned him at 2 a.m. and basically demanded his presence at Manhattan's infamous Jilly's where he was drinking away his sorrows. The bar was frequented by the famous and the infamous, especially a criminal element and Frank Sinatra had once quipped upon entering, 'Jesus, there must be forty-two indictments sitting at the bar.' Francis Newton 'Frank' Gifford is a former American football player and American sportscasterHe rose to prominence playing for the New York Giants and made eight Pro Bowl appearances and had five trips to the NFL Championship GameHis best season was 1956, when he won the MVP award of the NFL and led the Giants to the NFL title over the Chicago Bearhe suffered a severe injury in 1960 which kept him out of the game for almost two years.He returned to play as a wide receiver and retired in 1964 for good beginning a long career as a commentator for Monday Night FootballHe married television host Kathie Lee Gifford on October 18, 1986, and the pair have a son and daughter, Cody Newton Gifford and Cassidy Erin Gifford .

"A staff member has found what is being described by police as a 'deceased human fetus' in a bathroom at a Texas high school. Authorities in east Dallas are now looking for a student they believe gave birth inside Woodrow Wilson High School during class time on Friday. A maintenance worker made the disturbing discovery in a trash can in a second-floor girls' bathroom around 2:30pm. Scroll down for video . Fetus found: Police carry a tiny black body bag containing the remains of a fetus which was found in a trash can in a girls' bathroom at Woodrow Wilson High School in east Dallas . Police are reviewing security footage to determine who the mother of the fetus is and have referred to the girl or woman as a 'suspect.' A spokesperson for the Dallas Independent School District said the mother is likely a student at the school. '[The bathroom] could be used by staff members, but it's predominantly used by students,' Jon Dahlander told Fox 4. Woodrow Wilson has approximately 1,600 students, according to CBS. So far, police have not revealed a suspect and have asked anyone with any information to come forward. First week back: The school's 1,600 students were at the end of their first week back at school after the summer break when the discovery was made . 'We're reviewing video, talking to the teachers, trying to determine if anybody has any knowledge of any student that may have had something going on in their life, and pray,' Major John Lawton with the Dallas Police Department told Fox 4. Police have not revealed the developmental stage of the the fetus. Detectives with the Dallas Police Department's Child Abuse unit are investigating the incident and are hoping the mother of the fetus will come forward voluntarily. Counselors were called to the school on Friday to help students and staff after the shocking discovery and still on-hand Tuesday as students return from the long weekend. 'The district encourages parents and families to discuss the situation with their students, and when appropriate, encourage their students to meet with counseling staff at the school,' the school district said in a statement. 'Dallas ISD will continue to provide additional support and resources to the school community during this difficult time.'","A maintenance worker found a 'deceased human fetus' in a trash can at an east Dallas high school Friday .

"1 Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) 2 Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 3 Valterri Bottas (Williams) 4 Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) 5 Kevin Magnussen (McClaren) Lewis Hamilton’s rear left wheel was shredding its tyre into a thousand pieces and his rivalry with Nico Rosberg into a million tiny atoms of hatred. It was on the second lap of a bitter Belgian Grand Prix that the first cruel cut of the day was made: Rosberg was vying for the lead with Hamilton through Les Combes when his front wing punctured his team-mate. From first place, Hamilton limped back to the pits, rubber being thrown into the air as he went. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg argue about who's best . Jubilant: Daniel Ricciardo celebrates after winning the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday afternoon . Points: Nico Rosberg (second left), Ricciardo (centre) and Valtteri Bottas enjoy their podium moment . Unpopular: Rosberg was heavily booed by the Belgian fans for the part he played in the crash with Hamilton . His race was effectively over, even though he limped on at the back of the field for most of the afternoon before retiring, breathing a sigh of relief as he was pushed into the garage. Rosberg required a change of wing but was far less severely damaged, finishing second behind Daniel Ricciardo and extending his lead in the drivers’ standings to 29 points. Watching the accident unfold, it seemed Rosberg was to blame. He was behind Hamilton and responsible for keeping himself out of the way. ‘Nico hit me. Nico hit me,’ said Hamilton, registering his disgust at Rosberg’s aggression. But the stewards did not intervene. They put it down as a racing incident. That was the majority interpretation of most seasoned observers and former drivers here during and immediately after the race. It was the version Rosberg stuck to in his every public utterance, even in an evening tweet. However, what had been seen as a clumsy bit of driving was given a more sinister edge by Hamilton’s recollection of the post-race meeting between him, Rosberg, and team bosses Paddy Lowe and Toto Wolff. Hamilton (inset) claimed — and impeccable sources close to Mercedes concurred — that Rosberg told him he acted deliberately. Catch me if you can: Ricciardo in action during his Belgian Grand Prix win . Not for long: Lewis Hamilton leads Nico Rosberg before the Mercedes pair collide . Speed: Vettel began brightly and briefly led the charge as Alonso and Ricciardo followed . ‘He said he did it on purpose,’ said Hamilton. ‘He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault.’ Rosberg declined to comment on the accusation, maintaining in public that it was no more than a ‘racing incident’. There seems no doubt that Rosberg is willing to play dirty to win the world championship. In his defence, he believes Hamilton is too. Rosberg might even argue his deviousness is a direct response to Hamilton’s previous disregard for the imperatives of teamwork. Certainly, he was angry going into this weekend about Hamilton’s failure to follow a team instruction at the last race in Hungary. The four-week summer break hardly acted as balm. The Englishman, who refused to apologise for not giving way, alluded to this last night, saying: ‘It was interesting because we had a meeting on Thursday and Nico expressed how angry he was. I was thinking, “It’s been weeks you’ve been lingering with this”. He sat there and said how angry he was at Toto and Paddy.’ The animosity — the product of a suffocating internal fight for the title between two old karting buddies — has festered all season. Coming together: Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg clash during the Belgian Grand Prix . Setback: Hamilton was forced off with a punctured tyre after this collision . Blow: The Mercedes driver collided with team-mate Nico Rosberg during the early stages . 1 Nico Rosberg - 220 . 2 Lewis Hamilton - 191 . 3 Daniel Ricciardo - 156 . 4 Fernando Alonso - 121 . 5 Valterri Bottas - 110 . Each complained the other had fiddled with his engine settings earlier in the season before the mystery and moaning at Monaco, when Rosberg ran off the track during qualifying, something Hamilton believed was intended to hinder his final lap. So yesterday’s incident was an accident waiting to happen. The headstrong Lewis, with his tendency to brood on perceived slights, versus the calculating Rosberg, with the ice-cold ruthlessness he learned from three years as Michael Schumacher’s team-mate and a lifetime as Keke Rosberg’s son, was a combustible mix. With weak and inexperienced management, the likelihood of a self-destructive crash was greater. As Hamilton said after the race: ‘It reminds me of when I was at school, the teachers will say something but they won’t do anything.’ Hardly a grand prix weekend goes by when Mercedes don’t leave the paddock promising to call a meeting and discuss how they go racing. To quote John Watson, a five-time winner from 152 races during the sport’s dangerous days of the 1970s, the men running the team are ‘the three stooges’: Niki Lauda, the chairman, Wolff, the executive director, and Lowe, the technical boss. Well, yes, Lauda is a legend. But should he be walking around working for German media group RTL after a race? Would Ron Dennis act as a BBC pundit? Up and down: Rosberg leads the chasing pack during the first lap, but the German could only finish second . As for Wolff, he started his press conference by asking, albeit jovially: ‘What did Niki say? Just so we are aligned…’ It all feels a bit disjointed. Wolff was meant to be in charge of the commercial side of the operation yet he seems to have elided into being the de facto team principal. Nevertheless, Lowe issues the most important instructions over the radio. There is not a central figure — a Ross Brawn — who calls the shots. The result, demonstrably, is that neither driver respects the instructions he is given. Bubbles: Red Bull Racing's technical chief Adrian Newey is soaked in champagne by Ricciardo . Anger: Hamilton claimed he gave Rosberg space, so couldn't 'understand' what had happened . Cheers: Rosberg was frustrated that Mercedes didn't finish the day with a team one-two . VIDEO Ricciardo wins as Rosberg hits Hamilton . So Wolff tried again last night to reassert his authority, saying: ‘It’s unacceptable. It’s clear. Racing accidents can happen, racing accidents among team-mates shouldn’t happen, racing incidents between team-mates on lap two of a 44-lap race with the dominant car should be a no, no, no, no, no.’ He said the team would review their policy of not imposing team orders. OK, but rules only work if they are followed. Yesterday, they were not. And the upshot of this fratricide? Ricciardo, driving supremely, is 64 points off Rosberg. Can the Australian, with three race wins already, creep to the title? Just a thought. 1 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Red Bull 1hr 24mins 36.556secs . 2 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes  1:24:39.939 . 3 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Williams 1:25:04.588 . 4 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Ferrari 1:25:13.371 . 5 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 1:25:28.752 . 6 Kevin Magnussen (Den) McLaren 1:25:30.818 . 7 Jenson Button (GBR) McLaren 1:25:31.136 . 8 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Ferrari 1:25:37.718 . 9 Sergio Perez (Mex) Force India 1:25:40.849 . 10 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:25:41.903 . --- . 11 Nico Hulkenberg(Ger)Force India 1:25:42.253 . 12 Jean-Eric Vergne(Fra)Scuderia Toro Rosso 1:25:48.476 . 13 Felipe Massa(Bra)Williams 1:25:52.531 . 14 Adrian Sutil(Ger)Sauber-Ferrari 1:25:59.003 . 15 Esteban Gutierrez(Mex)Sauber-Ferrari 1:26:07.381 . 16 Max Chilton(Gbr)Marussia at 1 Lap . 17 Marcus Ericsson(Swe)Caterham at 1 Lap .

"The British militant 'Jihadi John' was chosen to execute Americans James Foley and Steven Sotloff because it would make other Westerners feel part of ISIS cause, a fighter who defected from the group has said. The former insurgent, in his 20s and now based in Turkey, said Jihadi John helped to showcase ISIS to Western recruits. He said: 'It is possible that the goal was to project the image that a European or a Western person executed an American so that they can showcase their Western members and appeal to others outside Syria and make them feel that they belong to the same cause and that they too can do anything in support of ISIS in their respective countries.' Scroll down for video . The British militant known as 'Jihadi John' was purposely chosen to kill American journalist Steven Sotloff (pictured) to appeal to other disenfranchised Westerners, according to a former ISIS fighter . Prime Minister David Cameron today vowed to 'squeeze' ISIS out of existence and indicated that he may be willing to use the RAF to bomb the terrorist organisation. He also said that the terrorist, known as Jihad John, believed to be responsible for the murder of the two US journalists, will face justice 'one way or another'. The fanatic, who has a multicultural London accent, killed Mr Foley in a video released two weeks ago and Mr Sotloff - like Mr Foley a journalist - in a clip released earlier this week. The ISIS defector told CNN the principle goal of the organisation was to establish an Islamic state first in the Middle East, and then extend it to the rest of the world.

He added: 'Since Western fighters joined ISIS they consider their home country as infidels. 'If they have a chance they will carry out attacks because they consider it an infidel country and it should be fought.' It's believed there are about 500 Britons currently enlisted within ISIS ranks in Syria and Iraq and the numbers are growing daily.

"New pictures have surfaced showing a different side to Darren Wilson, the Ferugson, Missouri police officer who shot dead unarmed black teen Michael Brown last month. Wilson has been in hiding since the deadly confrontation, as protesters descended on the St Louis suburb and clashed with police, enraged by the 18-year-old's killing. Previously, only one picture of the 28-year-old police officer was released, taken by his father as he accepted an award with the department. Scroll down for video . Pictured: New photos have been released showing Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Missouri police officer who shot dead unarmed teen Michael Brown last month. All but one of the new pictures show Wilson at his wedding in October 2011 . Stature: The new pictures show Wilson is of a sturdy build, and considerably taller than the rest of his wedding party in the group shot. Supporters have defended Wilson by saying he was intimidated by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and about 300 pounds . Broken up: Wilson and wife Ashley Nicole were married in Old Monroe, Missouri in October 2011 but divorced last year . Selfie: The last picture show Wilson and an unidentified woman in a photo originally posted to Facebook . But on Wednesday, the website Colorlines was the first to publish a batch of new pictures showing Wilson at his wedding, and taking a selfie with an unidentified woman. The pictures of Wilson at his wedding, taken by a professional photographer and guests at the nuptials, are especially important considering what has been said about his fight with Michael Brown, the afternoon of August 9. Wilson got into a physical fight with Brown after stopping the teen for walking into the middle of the street, and the altercation ended when witnesses saw Wilson shoot Brown as he was surrendering with his hands up. Previously, only one picture was published of Darren Wilson - a grainy shot taken by his father at a police award ceremony (right). Wilson shot dead Michael Brown (left) the afternoon of August 9, after stopping the teen for walking in the middle of the street . Supporters of Wilson have defended his actions by saying he was threatened by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds and described as a 'gentle giant' by friends and family. 'I can even say without speaking to Darren, without even having heard his statements, that at that moment in time, he was scared for his life, I am 100% positive of that,' Wilson's longtime friend Jake Shepard told CNN. Local police also played up the intimidation story by releasing a video of Brown allegedly threatening a shop owner during a robbery just prior to his death. Stills of the robbery were released the day Wilson was named, along with a description of the shots saying Brown 'towers over [name redacted] appearing to intimidate him. Brown then turns back around and walks out of camera view.' But Wilson appears to have the same body type in the pictures at his wedding in October 2011. Wilson stands well above the wedding party and has a brawny build. Another picture shows a better close up view of Wilson's face, next to that of a woman who has been blurred out. The wedding pictures were taken in  Old Monroe, Missouri, which is about a half-hour outside Jennings where Wilson was a police officer at the time. Soon after the wedding, Wilson left the department to work for the Ferguson Police. Wilson and his wife divorced in November. Aftermath: Witnesses say Wilson finished the fight by shooting Brown just as he was surrendering with his hands up.

"A teenage girl was beheaded by a relative in northern Afghanistan after she turned down his marriage proposals, according to reports. The victim, named as Gisa, was decapitated with a knife in the Imam Sahib district of Kunduz province on Tuesday, local police said. She is believed to be around 15-years-old. A police spokesman said two men, named as  Sadeq and Massoud, had been arrested following the teenage girl's murder. The two men are understood to be close relatives of the victim that live in the same village. Local police sources have said the men behind the attack wanted to marry the girl, but their advances had been turned down by victim's father. Violence: The teenage girl is understood to have been beheaded after she refused a relative's repeated marriage proposals (FILE PHOTO) Gisa is understood to have been attacked as she returned to her home in Kulkul village after going out to collect water from a nearby well. Her father told a local news agency he had not wanted his daughter to get married because she was too young. Afghanistan's Taliban regime - notorious for its oppression of women in the country - was ousted in 2001, but extreme violence against women is still rife. In 2009 the Elimination of Violence Against Woman law was introduced in Afghanistan, criminalising child marriage, forced marriage, 'giving away' a girl or woman to settle a dispute, among other acts of violence against the female population of the ultra-conservative Islamic nation. But the UN has said there is a 'long way to go' before the rights of Afghan women are fully protected. Comprehensive official statistics on the number of incidents of violence against women in the country are difficult to establish, with the majority of cases going unreported. However in the year to March 2011, Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission registered over 2,000 acts of violence against women. The NATO-led International Security and Assistance Force has given high priority to re-establishing women's rights that were eradicated under the Taliban as part of its efforts to create a security strategy for Afghanistan. But with the deadline for international troops to pull out of the country - scheduled for the end of 2014 - looming, activists have warned that the outlook for the female population remains bleak. Human Rights Watch has said women's rights are increasingly at risk in the run up to the scheduled draw-down of NATO forces, with early and forced marriage, impunity for violence against women and lack of access of justice among the long list of challenges they still face. 'Beheaded': The teenage girl is understood to have been attacked as she returned to her home in the Imam Sahib district after fetching water from a nearby well . While Afghan women have won back some basic rights since the Taliban was toppled 11 years ago, so-called honour killings remain relatively commonplace in the war-torn Islamic nation. The summer of 2012 saw a spate of so-called honour killings in Afghanistan. In July a father shot his two teenage daughters dead in the Nad Ali district of Helmand when they returned home four days after running away with a man. Earlier that same month shocking video footage emerged of a 22-year-old Afghan woman being gunned down with an AK47 in front of a crowd of baying villagers in Parwan province. Thought to have been married to a member of a hardline Taliban militant group, the woman, known only as Najiba, was executed after being accused of having an affair with a Taliban commander. Her murder followed a horrific case in Ghazni province in which a man beheaded his ex-wife and two of their children. Serata's former spouse barged into her home and decapitated her in front of their eight-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter. He then killed the children because they had seen, police said. This year the country's Independent Human Rights Commission recorded 16 incidents of honour killings in March and April alone, the first two months of the Afghan new year. During the month of July a spate of brutal killings in the country - which left four women and two children dead - attracted international attention. The Independent Human Rights Commission warned last month that Afghanistan has seen a sharp rise in cases of both honour killings and rape, adding that many incidents of murder and sexual assault go unreported to authorities. The ever-present threat of violence at the hands of men in a patriarchal society has also led to an increase in cases of Afghan women taking their own lives. Dozens of women commit suicide in the country each year, often to escape failed or abusive marriages. Divorce is still taboo in Afghanistan, and women who flee their marriages, if caught, face stringent prison sentences. A family court established in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, in 2003 offered a semblance of hope for women in the country that are trapped in forced marriages or subject to domestic violence - but it still adheres to Afghanistan's version of Islamic sharia law. Traditional Afghan culture places no onus on a man who wants to leave his spouse to go through legal proceedings - he can divorce his wife without any approval of the justice system. In the court in Kabul, a woman must plead her case before judges and lawyers, and she must have five male witnesses willing to attend in support. A recent case saw a 17-year-old girl forced to accept a marriage proposal from a man she despised successfully argued for her engagement to be scrapped by the court, according to The Washington Post. Tragically for Farima, who dreamed of becoming a doctor, the decision did not mark a return to the life of relative freedom she enjoyed before her engagement. Before taking her battle to the court, the desperate teenager had thrown herself from the roof of her Kabul home. Farima broke her back in the fall, but survived. Her fiance insisted that their planned marriage must still go ahead, leading the now disabled teenager to take her battle to the family court. Following the case, the 17-year-old is back in her childhood home. Her family did not allow her to return to school, and the injuries she sustained in her failed suicide bid mean relatives fear she will be unlikely to marry in the future. While she managed, against the odds, to free herself from a fate she dreaded, the future for this defiant Afghan girl still looks bleak.

"The U.S. military launched its highly secretive unmanned $1 billion X-37B space plane into orbit today from Cape Canaveral on top of an Atlas V rocket. The U.S. Air Force which operates the small, top-secret version of the space shuttle still will not say how long the third X-37B mission will last, nor what the vehicle will be doing in orbit. Cloud coverage in the area had threatened to scupper today's launch, but the skies cleared sufficiently for the classified mission to take-off on time at 1.03 p.m from the Florida space center. Scroll Down for Video . A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket, carrying an X-37B experimental robotic space plane, lifts off from launch complex 41 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in 2012 . It is the second flight for this original X-37B spaceplane. The craft circled the planet for seven months in 2010. A second X-37B spacecraft spent more than a year in orbit. The high-tech mystery machines – 29 feet long – are about one-quarter the size of NASA's old space shuttles and can land automatically on a runway. The two previous touchdowns occurred in Southern California; this one might end on NASA's three-mile-long runway once reserved for the space agency's shuttles. The military isn't saying much if anything about this new secret mission known as OTV-3, or Orbital Test Vehicle, flight No. 3. In fact, launch commentary ended 17 minutes into the flight and a news blackout followed. Lift-Off: Air Force officials said the unmanned space plane, which resembles a miniature space shuttle, provides a way to test technologies in space . But one scientific observer, Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, speculates the spaceplane is carrying sensors designed for spying and likely is serving as a testbed for future satellites. He dismisses rumors of 'exotic ideas' for the X-37B as weaponry or shadowing a Chinese satellite. While acknowledging he does not know what the spaceplane is carrying, McDowell said on-board sensors could be capable of imaging or intercepting transmissions of electronic emissions from terrorist training sites in Afghanistan or other hot spots. 'All the sorts of things that spy satellites generally do,' he said. The beauty of a reusable spaceplane is that it can be launched on short notice based on need, McDowell said. What's important about this flight is that it is the first reflight. 'That is pretty cool,' McDowell said, 'reusing your spacecraft after a runway landing. That's something that has only really been done with the shuttle.'

Now retired museum pieces, NASA's space shuttles stretch 122 feet long, and have 78-foot wingspans and weights of more than 170,000 pounds. They were launched, from 1981 to 2011, with two strap-on booster rockets and an external fuel tank feeding three main engines. The X-37B wingspan is 15 feet, and the 11,000-pound, Boeing-built vessel requires the United Launch Alliance's hefty Atlas V for hoisting. It is solar powered. The two previous secret X-37B flights were in 200-plus-mile-high orbits, circling at roughly 40-degree angles to the equator, as calculated by amateur satellite trackers. That means the craft flew over the swatch between 40 degrees or so north latitude and 40 degrees or so south latitude. That puts Russia's far north out of the spaceplane's observing realm, McDowell noted. 'It might be studying Middle Eastern latitudes or it might just be being used for sensor tests over the United States,' he said. McDowell speculates that this newest flight will follow suit. Lift off: The X-37B sits on top of an Atlas V rocket as it's launched at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida in 2010 . The military is not saying how long the third X-37B mission will last, nor what the vehicle will be doing in orbit. 'The focus of the program remains on testing vehicle capabilities and proving the utility and cost-effectiveness of a reusable spacecraft,' Air Force spokeswoman Tracy Bunko wrote in an email to Reuters. While launching from Florida, the military has been landing the robotic space planes at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The agency is considering landing and refurbishing its X-37B spaceships at NASA and Air Force bases in Florida, which has been courting new customers since the retirement of NASA's space shuttles last year. Personnel are shown here inspecting the X-37B, the Air Force's first unmanned re-entry spacecraft, after landing on December 3, 2010 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . 'We are investigating the possibility of using the former shuttle infrastructure for X-37B OTV landing operations and are looking into consolidating landing, refurbishment and launch operations at Kennedy Space Center or Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in an effort to save money,' Bunko wrote. 'Those investigations are in an early state, and any specifics will not be known for some time,' she added. The vehicles, which were built by Boeing, are about one-fourth the size of a NASA shuttle and use solar panels to generate power, rather than chemical fuel cells that limited the space shuttles' time in orbit. Neither NASA nor the Air Force has plans to upgrade the X-37B to carry people. A computer graphic shows what the X-37B will look like operating in space. The craft took a decade to develop and is operated by the U.S. Air Force . This computer image shows the space plane re-entering Earth. Although it resembles a small space shuttle it is not designed to carry humans. It's wingspan is a mere 4.5m with a length of 8.9m. It is powered by batteries and solar cells . The OTV-3 flight had been delayed several months pending the results of an investigation into an upper-stage engine problem during an October 4 Delta 4 flight to put a Global Positioning System satellite into orbit. The International Space Station, by comparison, orbits about 250 miles high but at a much steeper 51.6-degree inclination, or angle to the equator, that covers more territory. The X-37B program, which dates back to 1999, is operated by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and geared toward space experimentation. Some scientists – like Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists – argue the Air Force could accomplish the same objectives by using cheaper, more efficient spacecraft that either burn up on entry or parachute down. 'The ability to return to Earth carries a high price,' Grego said in a statement.

"A U.S. citizen, who rushed to his native Sudan to save his pregnant wife from the death sentence, described his horror at seeing her shackled in a prison cell with their toddler son. Meriam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag, 27, was charged . with adultery for marrying Christian Daniel Wani, a Sudanese man with U.S. citizenship who lives in New Hampshire. She was sentenced to 100 lashes as the Sudanese court refuses to recognize her 2011 marriage to Mr Wani because they consider Ishag a Muslim. The eight-months pregnant woman, who has a 20-month-old son, was subsequently sentenced to death for the crime of apostasy. Sudanese law considers her a Muslim while she has declared that she was raised Christian and refuses to convert to Islam because Christianity is the only religion she knows. She told the court: 'I was never a Muslim. I was raised a Christian from the start.' Scroll down for video . Daniel Wani married wife Meriam in 2011. She was sentenced to death in Sudan last week because the court considers her Muslim and found her guilty of apostasy for converting to Christianity. Her husband, a U.S. citizen, has flown to Sudan, to try to save her life . Ishag is considered Muslim by the . Sudanese court because her father was a Sudanese Muslim. However the . woman was raised by her Ethiopian Christian mother after her father left them. She has been shackled at the legs since the sentence was handed down and her feet are swollen, her husband said. Mr Wani, 33, was allowed to visit his . wife for the first time on Monday where she is being held along with the . couple's 20-month-old son Martin. Daniel Wani and his brother, Gabriel, fled the worn-torn African country of Sudan in 1998 and settled in Manchester, New Hampshire, to get a fresh start. In 2005, Mr Wani became a naturalized U.S. citizen.He met Meriam Ibrahim, a wealthy Sudanese national who owns a shopping mall in Khartoum, on one of his many visits to Sudan. In 2012, Wani and Ibrahim married during a Christian wedding ceremony and soon after had their first child, Martin. The family own homes in New Hampshire and in Khartoum, Sudan, since the husband and wife operate several businesses in both countries. Last summer, Mr Wani traveled back to Khartoum to arrange for his wife and son to emigrate to the U.S., but the American Embassy was allegedly dragging its feet. While Daniel Wani was working behind the scenes to try and secure Meriam and Martin's safe passage to the U.S., the 27-year-old woman was arrested after her father's family claimed she was born a Muslim but married a Christian in violation of Sudan's strict religious laws. Ibrahim had been released pending her trial, but was rearrested in February after being charged with apostasy - an offense punishable by death - after declaring that she had been a Christian since childhood. Her execution by hanging has been delayed by a Sudanese court to allow her to give birth and nurse her infant. ‘We are praying for a miracle,’ her brother-in-law Gabriel Wani told New Hampshire Union Leader. The father is not allowed to care for Martin because he is a Christian and his son is considered a Muslim. Daniel Wani , a naturalized American citizen, claims his 20-month-old son, Martin, who is currently sharing a cell with his heavily pregnant mother in a Sudanese women’s prison, was born in the U.S. However, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State would not confirm if Martin Wani is in fact a U.S. citizen. Mr Wani said that when he appealed to the State Department for help in freeing his condemned wife and child from prison, he was asked to provide DNA evidence proving that the toddler was his biological son. ‘I will have to take a DNA sample in Khartoum, then send it to the USA for testing,’ Wani told the news site Morning Star News. ‘I have provided wedding documents and the baby’s birth certificate, and doors were closed on his face.’ The distraught husband added that he has tried to apply for documents to travel to the U.S. with his family, but the American Embassy in Sudan denied him assistance. ‘My son is an American citizen living in a difficult situation in prison,’ the father stated. When asked by a CNS News reporter about Martin Wani's legal status, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki replied: 'I don't have any more details to share.' Tina Ramirez, executive director of Hardwired, . an American group which fights for religious freedom around the world, . told MailOnline today: Yesterday Daniel saw his wife finally but he told . us that his wife had shackles on her feet and they were swollen. 'Originally, . he had been told he would not be allowed to see her so this was a . surprise. He was also told he would only be allowed to see his son . Martin once a week.' The couple's lawyer is working on an appeal to the 27-year-old's sentence amid mounting  international pressure. Mr Wani and his wife Meriam who married in 2011. The couple have a 20-month-old son Martin and the 27-year-old is due to give birth to their second child in a matter of weeks. The Sudanese court has allowed her give birth and nurse the child before they execute her . The happy couple on their wedding day in 2011. Mr Wani described on Monday seeing his pregnant wife shackled in a Sudanese prison where she is being held on sentence of death . Ms . Ramirez added: 'The lawyers are working on their appeal to the high . court and we are standing with them and the people of Sudan who are . outraged by this injustice. 'Many . young advocates and opposition groups met last week and are calling for . the amendment of the criminal code to remove any punishment for . apostasy.' The White House condemned the pregnant mother's treatment and urged the Government of Sudan to meet its obligations under international human rights law. Meriam Yahya Ibrahim, 27, was charged with adultery for marrying Christian Daniel Wani, a Sudanese man with U.S. citizenship living in New Hampshire . The death sentence has been put on hold until she has given birth and nurses her newborn. Mr Wani now lives in Manchester with his brother Gabriel, who told WMUR that his sibling had returned home to do everything he could to save his wife. U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) New Hampshire's senators are working to save pregnant Meriam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag from being executed. New Hampshire's Senator Kelly Ayotte and . fellow Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri have written to . Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to grant the 27-year-old . Sudanese woman political asylum. Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) Hampshire's Senator Kelly Ayotte and fellow Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri have written to Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to grant the 27-year-old Sudanese woman political asylum. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, (Democrat-New Hampshire) called the death sentence an 'abhorrent violation of fundamental freedoms and universal rights'. The British government had expressed its anger to a senior Sudanese diplomat over the pregnant mother's sentence and urged him to pressure the government to overturn the ruling. Gabriel Wani said: 'I’m just praying for God. He can do a miracle. Everyone is depressed. You don’t believe it. It’s shock.' Gabriel Wani said that his brother was at the family's home in Khartoum where he was trying to work iwith the U.S. Embassy to appeal his wife's sentence. Daniel Wani was in fear for his life, his brother said and believed he was being watched. Mr Wani married wife Meriam in a formal ceremony in 2011 and the couple own several businesses including a farm close to the Sudanese capital, Fox reported. Gabriel Wani told the Union Leader that he and his brother had come to the U.S. in 1998 to flee war-ravaged Sudan. Daniel Wani has been a U.S. citizen since 2005 and last summer went to Sudan to arrange for his wife and son to join him in New Hampshire. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from the U.S. Department of State. At last Thursday's sentencing, Judge Abbas al Khalifa asked the pregnant, mother-of-one whether she would return to Islam - but she refused. She said: 'I am a Christian,' and the death sentence was handed down. After the verdict her husband, Daniel Wani told CNN: 'I'm so frustrated. I don't know what to do. I'm just praying.' A government spokesman said the ruling could be appealed in a higher court. Gabriel Wani speaks on Friday in New Hampshire about his sister-in-law Meriam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag, who is being persecuted in Sudan for her religious beliefs . More than 50 protesters gathered outside the Sudanese court last week where Mariam Yahya Ibrahim Ishag was sentenced to death . Outside the court, around 50 people held up signs that read Freedom of Religion while some Islamists celebrated the ruling, chanting: 'God is Greatest.' On February 7, Ishag was arrested in September with her 20-month-old son and put in a women’s prison. It is thought a relative had turned her in to the police for marrying a Christian. According to the Sudan’s Public Order Criminal Code, she is a Muslim by default because she was born in Sudan. Therefore, her marriage to a Christian is classed as a criminal act. On . March 4, she was charged with adultery and apostasy. The adultery . charge came with a punishment of 100 lashes and the apostasy charge came . with a punishment of death. Sudanese university students have protested near Khartoum University in recent weeks asking for an end to human rights abuses, more freedoms and better social and economic conditions in the country. The authorities decided on Sunday to close the university indefinitely. Western embassies and Sudanese activists sharply condemned the accusations and called on the Sudanese Islamist-led government to respect freedom of faith. 'The details of this case expose the regime's blatant interference in the personal life of Sudanese citizens,' Sudan Change Now Movement, a youth group, said in a statement. President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's government is facing a huge economic and political challenge after the 2011 secession of South Sudan, which was Sudan's main source of oil. A decision by Bashir last year to cut subsidies and impose austerity measures prompted violent protests in which dozens were killed and hundreds were injured. The White House said that it strongly condemn the sentence and urged the Government of Sudan to meet its obligations under international human rights law. Under Sudanese law, Muslims who convert to other religions are sentenced to death. Muslim women in Sudan are banned from marrying non-Muslims but Muslim men can marry a woman of a different faith.

"A woman who suffered an extreme allergic reaction to eyelash extensions was forced to spend five hours peeling them off her face after the salon refused to remove them. Jane Rolfe, 42, was left with severely blistered skin for weeks after suffering a severe, painful allergic reaction to the glue used to apply eyelash extensions. She claims her local beauty salon in Essex failed to perform a patch test - where a small part of the substance is placed on the skin more than 24 hours beforehand to check for an allergic reaction. Although Mrs Rolfe, a primary school teaching assistant, told the beautician she had never had extensions before, she says she was not given an allergy test. Jane Rolfe was left with severely blistered skin for weeks after suffering a severe, painful allergic reaction to the glue used to apply eyelash extensions . She woke up the following morning with severely irritated, stinging and bloodshot eyes. When she returned to the salon, she claims she was told this was normal, but her symptoms grew worse, with blisters forming around her eye line and a rash spreading across her face. She told MailOnline: 'The whole experience was harrowing. My GP advised me to go back to the salon and ask them to remove the extensions, but they wouldn’t do it and recommended I go home and try to remove them myself. 'It took me five hours to work them free using nothing but soap and water and it was an excruciatingly painful experience, but even after that the rash and irritation carried on getting worse. Mrs Rolfe woke up the next morning with severely irritated, stinging and bloodshot eyes . 'It was only after my doctor put me on a course of steroids and anti-histamines that they gradually subsided. 'You go to a salon to make you feel good about yourself but this destroyed my confidence and left me with very painful injuries.' Mrs Rolfe now fears the incident may have triggered a lifelong intolerance to adhesives, after she subsequently suffered another reaction to household superglue. The insurer is refusing to cover the beauty salon in Brentwood, claiming it broke the terms of its policy by not carrying out the patch test. This means Mrs Rolfe's only option for compensation is to sue the salon directly – which would likely put it out of business. She said: 'I think it’s disgusting that people in my situation are being denied compensation for negligence because insurers are refusing to pay out.' Mrs Rolfe's lawyers at JMW Solicitors have seen an influx of enquiries from women who have suffered adverse reactions from eye extension glue. Her lawyer, Rachel Crook, said: 'Jane’s story is a strong warning to anyone visiting a hair or beauty salon to always ensure that they have a patch test, even if it causes delays. 'It’s very worrying that the insurance company won’t indemnify their client, when the whole reason salons take out insurance is to protect themselves from exactly this kind of incident. 'Although Jane and victims in similar circumstances are well within their right to seek compensation for their injuries, the pay-out they would receive from pursuing a claim could easily put these small enterprises out of business.

"A young woman whose headaches were dismissed as migraines died just hours after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. Claire Gardiner, 30, only discovered how ill she was after she was admitted to hospital due to severe vomiting. She had been told by doctors she was suffering from migraines. Miss Gardiner, from Heighington, County . Durham, was taken to Darlington Memorial . Hospital after the vomiting left her unable to eat . or drink for more than a week. Claire Gardiner died just hours after finding out she had a brain tumour, despite doctors reassuring her she simply had migraines . She was given fluids and discharged but during the night woke her brother, Matthew, 25, after losing sight in her left eye. She was rushed back into hospital and transferred to The James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, where doctors found the tumour. The brain tumour had grown and put pressure on Claire's brain, leaving her suddenly blind in one eye. Doctors tried to reduce the swelling, but the tumour acted aggressively to the medication and nothing could be done to help her. She died hours later on December 20 last year. Her brother said: 'The tumour was 10cm by 10cm and causing huge pressure on her brain. 'They tried to reduce the swelling but it had acted aggressively to the medication and they couldn't help her.' Her family have since paid to her, and how she continued to help others after her death by donating her organs. Three people in their twenties and a man in his sixties are are now recovering from operations after receiving her organs. Miss Gardiner's family has now urged others to become organ donors and help save lives. Her brother, Eddie, said his sister was extremely charitable and would always try to help those less fortunate. 'Claire registered as an organ donor when she was 17. Even after her death she wanted to help people. Miss Gardiner was rushed to the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough (pictured), where doctors found a huge tumour that had spread across her brain . 'She was a loving caring person who would help anyone and in any way that she could. 'She wouldn't pass anyone in need if she could help and she would always give money to all of the Big Issue sellers she passed while out shopping. 'At Christmas time she would send Christmas cards to Salvation Army to give out to people who wouldn't have received anything, and tried to spread some cheer to those in need. 'For her 30th birthday she even paid for us all to go to her favourite city, Rome, to celebrate.' Miss Gardiner worked in the NHS supply chain with DHL, and was previously employed as a solicitor with Clarke Willis as an immigration case worker. Outside work, her brother said she had a real passion for motorcycling. 'She loved her jobs, and like all girls she loved spending money on handbags and shoes. 'But she wasn't a girly girl, she also loved her Honda motorbike and would regularly come out riding with me and Matthew and would not be outdone by the boys. 'Anything we did, she would have a go at too, even when our mum, Donella, tried to bribe her with a BMW convertible car to stop her getting a bike licence. 'We spent a lot of time together and were really close, and everyone knew how kind and caring Claire was.' A Just Giving fund, set up in Miss Gardiner's memory by her family, has raised more than £1,500 for the Salvation Army. Anthony Kennedy, a specialist nurse at NHS Blood and Transplant Organ Donation, said: 'Our condolences go out to Claire's family. 'Losing someone you love is never easy and deciding to donate their organs can be difficult. 'By signing up to the NHS Organ Donor Register Claire made her wishes known so her family were able to make the decision with the knowledge that they had respected these wishes. 'With around 10,000 people needing an organ transplant in the UK and three people dying every day, it's vital that people show their support for organ donation by signing up to the NHS Organ Donor Register and telling their families.'","Claire Gardiner, 30, was admitted to hospital due to severe vomiting .

"When humans first left Africa some 60,000 years ago, they went on to leave their genetic footprints around the world. These same footprints have revealed that some humans decided to return to Africa, carrying genes from the rest of the world back to the continent. Now a new study of southern African genes reveals that a previously unknown migration took western Eurasian DNA back to continent 3,000 years ago. Researchers found signs of Eurasian genes in individuals belonging to a range of Khoisan tribes (pictured) Writing in the New Scientist, Catherine Brahic reports on a study that looked at the DNA of Khoisan tribes of southern Africa. The Khoisan tribes are thought to have lived in near-isolation from the rest of humanity for thousands of years. The study by Harvard University revealed that that some of their genes closely match people from modern-day southern Europe, including Spain and Italy. Dating methods suggest the European DNA made their way into the Khoisan DNA sometime between 900 and 1800 years ago, before known European contact with the region . The recent research confirms a 2012 study by Luca Pagani of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute which found non-African genes in people living in Ethiopia. They found that the genomes of some Ethiopian populations bear striking similarities to those of populations in Israel and Syria, a potential genetic legacy of the Queen of Sheba and her companions. The team detected mixing between some Ethiopians and non-African populations dating to approximately 3,000 years ago. Researchers have now identified two migrations: One about 3,000 years ago, of non-Africans entering east Africa, and a second one 900–1,800 years ago. ‘These are very special, isolated populations, carrying what are probably the most ancient lineages in human populations today,’ David Reich of Harvard University told New Scientist. Dating methods suggest the European DNA made their way into the Khoisan DNA sometime between 900 and 1800 years ago, before known European contact with the region. Meanwhile, archaeological studies of the region suggest that a subset of the Khoisan, known as the Khoe-Kwadi speakers, arrived in southern Africa from east Africa much earlier. Professor Reich found that the proportion of Eurasian DNA was highest in Khoe-Kwadi tribes, who have up to 14 per cent of western Eurasian ancestry. ‘These populations were always thought to be pristine hunter-gatherers who had not interacted with anyone for millennia,’ added Professor Reich's collaborator, linguist Brigitte Pakendorf. ‘Well, no. Just like the rest of the world, Africa had population movements too. There was simply no writing, no Romans or Greeks to document it.’ It is uncertain why humans first left Africa, but researchers believe it has something to do with major climatic shifts that were happening around that time.

"David Cameron came to the defence of Bomber Command last night, calling them ‘heroes of our country’ who played a vital role in defeating Hitler. The Prime Minister launched an impassioned defence of the sacrifice of the RAF in what was seen as a public slap down of the Archbishop of Canterbury over his apology for the bombing of Dresden. Mr Cameron made his remarks to hundreds of dock workers at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk, and prompted an immediate round of applause. Scroll down for video . Impassioned: The Prime Minister (left) launched a defence of the sacrifice of the RAF in what was seen as a public slap down of the Archbishop of Canterbury (right) over his apology for the bombing of Dresden . Last week the Mail reported how Archbishop Welby had spoken of his ‘profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow’ over the bombing of Dresden on the 70th anniversary of the raids. Since the Mail published the story, we have been deluged with letters from readers deploring his comments, including from members of Bomber Command and relatives of those who gave their lives to defeat the Nazis. Asked yesterday if he agreed with the Archbishop, Mr Cameron made clear his strong feelings of gratitude for the role of air personnel during the Second World War. They were, he said, ‘very brave people who took enormous risks with incredible loss of life on our behalf to save Europe, to save Britain from fascism, from Hitler’. He said: ‘Bomber Command played an absolutely vital role in our war effort. One of the things I was very proud to do as Prime Minister was to make sure the people who served in Bomber Command got proper recognition with a new clasp on their medals. Allied bombing raids on Dresden left 25,000 civilians dead in 1945 and razed much of the city to the ground . ‘And it was a great honour to hand out some of those medals to people who have waited for many, many years for the recognition I think they deserve. ‘I’m very lucky to occasionally get to jog around St James’s Park in London, and I always stop and look up at the Bomber Command memorial and think about those very brave people. ‘To me the people who served in Bomber Command are heroes of our country and they played a very important role in the Second World War.’ The Prime Minister was in Felixstowe to speak about his plans to improve the economy of the region. Archbishop Welby spoke of his feelings about the Dresden raids – which left 25,000 civilians dead and reduced much of the city to rubble in 1945 – at a church service attended by German President Joachim Gauck. Seventy years ago: The German city of Dresden in flames following Allied bombings in February 1945 . He said: ‘Whatever the arguments, events here 70 years ago left a deep wound and diminished all our humanity. So as a follower of Jesus, I stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow.’ His address made no reference to more than 55,000 British aircrew killed in the war against Hitler, nor to the German bombing of London and Coventry. Later he was asked in a BBC interview if he thought Britain and America should apologise and said it was a ‘very complicated question’ – noting that British civilians had suffered during the Blitz and other German bombings. He said: ‘I think there is a deep need for profound sorrow at the events and the causes of such dreadful times as Europe lived through.’ Archbishop Welby’s spokesman later attempted to clarify the remarks, claiming that it was ‘manifestly false’ to suggest he was apologising.","PM makes impassioned defence of our Second World War bombing raids .

"The Olympics are an opportunity for athletes of all disciplines to come together - and when the competition heats up, hormones begin to bubble over. Now snowboarder Jamie Anderson, who took gold earlier this week in Sochi's slopestyle event, has admitted that the online dating app Tinder is 'next level'. Anderson, who took gold in the event Briton Jenny Jones won bronze, said that she eventually had to delete her account to focus on the Olympics. Next level: Jamie Anderson, celebrates during the medal ceremony for the Women's Snowboard Slopestyle Finals on February 9. She claimed Tinder was awash with athletes in the Olympic village . Distracting: Anderson (centre), flanked by silver medalist Enni Rukajarvi of Finland (left) and Britain's Jenny Jones (right), said she had to quit the app to focus on winning . Focused: Anderson in action, celebrating at the end of her final run in the slopestyle . 'Tinder in the Olympic Village is next level,' the 23-year-old from South Lake Tahoe, California, told Us Weekly. 'It's all athletes! In the mountain village it's all athletes. It's hilarious. There are some cuties on there. 'There was a point where I had to be like OK, this is way too distracting. 'I deleted my account to focus on the Olympics.' Anderson, described by Jones as a 'hippie', described winning gold earlier this week as 'Kind of a big deal'. 'I think it's fair to say Jamie marches to the beat of her own drummer,' American coach Mike Jankowski said. 'She likes to do things her way out here.' Tinder is a location-based dating app . that lets users browse for prospective partners nearby. Users choose yes . or no, and if there's a mutual match the app lets them know. Anderson's frank comments come after fellow snowboarder, New Zealander Rebecca Torr joked that she wanted to meet the Jamaican bobsled team on the app. Looking for love: When New Zealand snowboarder Rebecca Torr fired up Tinder on her phone she was disappointed to find that few of her fellow athletes had caught on to the 21st century dating tool .

'My tinder tweet made the Olympic village daily. Hopefully it brings me more matches and closer to the Jamaicans!' she joked.

"The chihuahua may be one of the smallest dog breeds but its appetite for destruction is larger than any other, a study has revealed. Over its lifetime, the tiny terrors will cause an average of £865 worth of damage by ripping or staining carpets, scratching or chewing sofas and digging up plants and flowerbeds. In contrast, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, which are perceived as fierce by many people, make the best pets as they cause the least amount of damage, costing around £178 in total. Chihuahuas (pictured) cause more damage than any other dog breed, a survey claims. The tiny dog causes an average of £866 worth of damage over its lifetime, proving that dog owners may have dominant personalities, but they can't always be in complete control . The ‘sausage’ dog or Dachshund also has a bad reputation with insurers and is the second most destructive dog according to the survey, with owners facing a bill of £810 to clean up their pet’s destruction, followed by the boxer with total damage of £784. ‘Chihuahuas may be tiny but it seems they will leave you with a bigger bill than any other dog,’ a spokesman for Sussex-based financial comparison site PayingTooMuch.com, said. ‘They might not have the size of other breeds but they can still leave more than their fair share of destruction behind them. ‘All pet owners expect a little damage from their dog from time to time, but when you add up the total amount spent on cleaning, repairing and replacing, it can be a huge amount. ‘Add to that extra costs from damage caused to other people’s property and bills if your pet is involved in an accident, and you can expect to part with a large amount of money.’ As good as gold: Staffordshire Bull Terriers (pictured) which are perceived as fierce by many people, make the best pets as they cause the least amount of damage, costing around £178 in total . The study of 2,000 dog owners found that the Dalmatian, Bulldog, Great Dane, Husky, Beagle, Pointer and German Shepherd make up the rest of the top 10 most destructive dogs. Staffordshire Bull Terriers cause the least damage and were followed by West Highland Terriers which cause around £183 worth of destruction over their lives. Third place went to Yorkshire Terriers with a bill of £227 followed by a Spaniel’s £230 and Whippet’s £251. Some people may be surprised that Rottweilers and active Sheepdogs are among the least destructive dogs. Researchers found that 57 per cent of dog owners will face a trail of destruction in their home at some point over their pet’s life, with scratched, ripped or chewed carpets the most likely damage. The 'sausage' dog or Daschund (pictured) also has a bad reputation with insurers and is the second most destructive dog according to the survey, with owners facing a bill of £810 to clean up their pet¿s destruction, followed by the Boxer with total damage of £784 . But it doesn’t stop in the home as 13 per cent even admitted their pet has caused damage to someone else’s property, with seven in ten then facing an average repair bill of £285 for that as well. More than one in five also admitted their pet has been involved in an accident, leaving them with a vet’s bill of a further £274. While owners love their pets, they are temporarily less affectionate when being hit with a large bill, with one in five admitting they have regretted getting their pet, with one in 10 considering giving them away. ‘When it comes to a pet, many owners turn a blind eye to the real costs involved because they are seen as being part of the family and are viewed with a loving eye,’ the spokesman said. ‘However as our research shows, the cost of owning a dog will usually exceed providing food, paying vets bills and buying toys as there will be other ancillary costs which should never be under-estimated for all sorts of reasons.’ Guilty: Around 13 per cent  of owners admitted their pet has caused damage to someone else's property, with seven in ten then facing an average repair bill of £285 for that as well. Labradors (pictured) are among the top 10 least destructive dogs . Millions of besotted cat owners are so keen to stay in touch with  their pets that they use their mobile phone or computer to call home and ‘speak’ to them. One in three use video messaging service Skype to see and give them attention, a poll of 1,000 owners claims. Almost a quarter of men admit they’ll even call home just to hear their feline friend purring. Ignoring the fact that cats only offer affection on their terms, half of British owners say they’d rather spend time with one than with a human. When owners and pets do spend quality time together it’s clear what they get up to. For 37 per cent of men say they have taught their cat to perform tricks, the poll for card retailer Hallmark shows. So it’s no surprise that 29 per cent of women say their cat is a fully-fledged member of the family.","A Chihuahua causes an average of £866 worth of damage over its lifetime .

"Louis van Gaal does not believe that Ashley Young dived to win a penalty during Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Sunderland - but admitted the winger made 'too much' of the tackle. During the second half of the match, Young appeared to throw himself over Sunderland defender Wes Brown's out-stretched leg in the penalty area with the ball already past him. Referee Martin Atkinson booked Young for simulation and waved away the United players’ appeals for a spot-kick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: Ashley Young did not dive . Touched: Ashley Young went down in the second half following a challenge from Wes Brown . Contact? Young was booked for simluation following the incident . Too much: Louis van Gaal thought it was a penalty but admits the winger made 'too much' of the tackle . Speaking to Sky Sports 1 after the game at the Stadium of Light, Van Gaal said: 'He (Young) was free at the ball. 'He lifted the ball across the player (Brown) and the opponent is kicking him. 'So after that he was jumping too much I think but what counts is that he was kicked by the opponent and then the referee can give a penalty.’ When asked again by Geoff Shreeves if Young dived, Van Gaal replied: 'No I don't think so. He was tackled in my opinion but after that he was exaggerating. ‘It is not diving because he was not touched by the opponent and I think that is always the reason and the rest is rubbish.' The incident occurred with the game evenly poised at 1-1. Juan Mata had opened the scoring against the run of play for the visitors in the first half when he tapped in an Antonio Valencia cross. Jack Rodwell then equalised for the Black Cats on his home debut with a bullet header on the half-hour mark. And Van Gaal rued the referee's decision not to award a penalty for the Young incident, or when Robin van Persie appeared to be fouled just moments before by Santiago Vergini.

Leveller: But Jack Rodwell equalised for Sunderland with a header from the corner after half an hour . The Dutchman continued: 'The same I think he (the referee) can also give the penalty to Van Persie. 'You can see that Van Persie was already losing the ball but the tackle was already coming and that is the reason why he has to give the penalty or not. 'There are referees who would give a penalty but nevertheless we have to create more chances than penalties.' Van Gaal was also asked about the potential imminent arrival of Angel Di Maria from Real Madrid for a fee of £60million. He refused to say United would sign the Argentina winger, but did admit he liked the player. 'Yeah (I do like Di Maria), but I like Messi also,' said Van Gaal. ‘There are an awful lot of players that I like but they cannot always come to Manchester United.' 'I think always the club has to announce it when they are ready and when we are thinking it is the right time for a transfer then we come to you and we say ""we have bought that player or the other player"".'

"For centuries, the ancient Egyptians used spells to banish evil spirits, find success in love and work and gain power. And now a collection of these spells and invocations, dating back 1,300 years, have been deciphered for the first time from an ancient handbook. Written in the now extinct language, Coptic, the codex contains a mixture of references from Orthodox Christianity and Sethianism. The 20-page book of spells (pictured) is written in Coptic language. It dates to the 7th century and contains a mixture of Orthodox Christian and Sethian invocations and spells, which are typically used to invoke a deity and spirit. The translations were made by Macquarie University professors Malcolm Choat and Iain Gardner . There are references made to Jesus, but also an entry called ‘Seth, the living Christ.’ Sethians were a Christian Gnostic sect who were found throughout the Mediterranean at the time the codex was written. They are said to have idolised Seth, the third son of Adam and Eve. The name Bakiotha is also mentioned in the text, referred to as the ‘lord over the forty and nine kinds of serpents’ and was a name used to invoke Christ. One spell is an appeal to Christ and reads: ‘I invoke you today, Bakiotha, great trustworthy one from above, who is trustworthy over the ninth generation of things. ‘Reach out and listen to us today.’ Coptic derived from a mixture of Greek script and seven Demotic signs in the upper parts of Egypt . Coptic was a language spoken in Egypt from the 2nd century until around the 17th. It derived from a mixture of Greek and seven Demotic signs, . The language originated in the upper parts of Egypt, and the Bohairic dialect from the lower parts of the country . The language is also closely linked to Heiroglyphic scripts. The translations were made by Macquarie professors Malcolm Choat and Iain Gardner. They are published in their book A Coptic Handbook of Ritual Power. The researchers believe the dialect suggests the codex comes from the region of the ancient city Hermopolis. Hermopolis was located near a small village called El-ashmunein, modern-day Al Ashmunin, which was the capital of the Fifteenth Nome - or laws - of Upper Egypt at the time. It is six miles north of Mallawi on the west bank of the River Nile. Macquarie University was given the 20-page handbook by an antiques dealer in 1981, and it is believed to have been owned by a male ritual practitioner. However, the identity of this practitioner and where the handbook originally came from is not known. It measures approximately 9 inches (23cms) across and is made from bound pages of parchment.

"A bus carrying mostly Hasidic Jews - where men sit at the front and women sit at the back - has provoked fury from the New York City Mayor. Michael Bloomberg said gender segregation on public buses is ‘obviously not permitted' and called the bus in Brooklyn, New York, an 'outrage'. From the outside the B110 might look like any other bus - but on the inside revelations about its seating arrangements are causing huge controversy.

The unusual practice has only come to . light after a woman told a student newspaper other riders said she had . to leave the front and sit in the back. The B110 has been operated by the Private Transportation Corporation for 38 years under a city franchise, reported the New York Times. The bus’s outer colours are red, white and blue, it costs $2.50 to ride and it is out of action on Friday night and most of Saturday. ‘It’s such a normal thing for us that women and men are separate,’ rider Gitty Green told the New York Times. ‘Most of the ladies go to the back.’ Male Hasidic Jew: There are guidelines in the bus saying if it is crowded then women should pay the driver in the front before boarding in the back . Anger: Mayor Michael Bloomberg said gender segregation on public buses is 'obviously not permitted' and called the bus in Brooklyn, New York, an 'outrage' The bus should be ‘available for public use’ because it was awarded the route in a public bid, a city transport spokesman told the New York Times.

"A second 'house of horrors' abortion clinic is being investigated in Texas, just days after Dr Kermit Gosnell was found guilty of murdering newborns at his Philadelphia termination center. Dr. Douglas Karpen, seen here in court, is accused of killing babies aborted in their third trimester . Houston doctor Douglas Karpen is accused by four former employees of delivering live fetuses during third-trimester abortions and killing them by either snipping their spinal cord, stabbing a surgical instrument into their heads or 'twisting their heads off their necks with his own bare hands'. Other times the fetus was so big he would have to pull it out of the womb in pieces, Karpen's ex-assistant, Deborah Edge, said in an Operation Rescue video, which has prompted a criminal investigation into the doctor. 'Sometimes he couldn't get the fetus . out... he would yank pieces – piece by piece – when they were oversize,' Edge explained. 'And I'm talking about the whole floor dirty. I'm talking . about me drenched in blood.' Two of Edge's colleagues, Gigi Aguliar, and Krystal Rodriguez, also described the hellish scenes which took place at the Aaron Women's Clinic in Houston in 2011, and possibly two other abortion clinics run by Karpen in Texas. Another staffer, who remains . anonymous, filed an affidavit with her account of events, which the . Texas Department of State Health Services is using in its investigation. 'We have several people looking into the allegations,' Harris County District Attorney spokesman Sara Marie Kinney told Chron.com. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said he had . read the allegations 'with disgust' before calling for a full investigation into Karpen and his clinics. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO - WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Speaking out: Krystal Rodriguez, left, Deborah Edge, center, and Gigi Aguliar, right, have all come forward to talk about their former boss Karpan . Lifenews.com, an anti-abortion news . website, has published cell phone photographs taken by the employees of fetuses with gashes in their necks after they were killed at the clinic, though these are far too gruesome for . MailOnline to show. Edge said fetuses were killed well . after 24 weeks gestation at the Houston clinic, which resulted in a . sweat-inducing job that took about an hour per procedure. She said every morning on . multiple occasions she would see fetuses born alive and then quickly . killed by the doctor. 'When . he did an abortion, especially an over 20 week abortion, most of the . time the fetus would come completely out before he either cut the spinal . cord or he introduced one of the instruments into the soft spot of the . fetus in order to kill it.... or actually twisting the head off the neck . with his own bare hands,' she explained. 'It was still alive because it was still moving and you could see the stomach breathing.' The women described one occasion where a fetus . that Karpen thought was dead suddenly 'opened its eyes and grabbed (the doctor's) finger' after he wrenched it from the womb. However, it met a similar fate to the other . fetuses at the clinic, the women said. 'He thought it was dead but the fetus actually opened its eyes and grabbed his finger,' Aguliar said. 'He was alive. He thought it was deceased already. He was getting ready to put it in the back.' Crime scene: The hellish scenes allegedly took place at the Aaron Women's Clinic, pictured, in Houston in 2011, and possibly two other abortion clinics run by Karpen in Texas . They also recounted occasions when women were so far along with their pregnancy they were actually induced into labor and in two cases their fetus' came out while they were in the bathroom. Rodriguez described another incident where a patient's fetus fell from her and onto the floor in the clinic's waiting room. '(Karpen) just picked it up with a Chux and put it in the trash bag,' she said. According to Rodriguez, as long as patients had the cash, Karpen would perform an abortion well past 24 weeks. A late-term procedure cost between $4,000 and $5,000 at the clinic, they said in the video which was filmed as the clinic was still operating and released on Wednesday. Edge said she regularly got upset during her work and couldn't watch when Karpen allegedly killed the newborns. But she said she didn't know that what he was doing was illegal. 'We used to look at each other and sometimes our tears would come out with the other assistants,' Edge said. 'We would always think ""he's so greedy.""'","Houston doctor Douglas Karpen is accused .

"Felicity Jones will play Hawking's 'dumped' wife Jane Wilde in film The Theory of Everything . It was seen as a fairytale pairing. He was the ailing academic with the debilitating disease who became a world-acclaimed physicist. She was the dark-haired beauty who discarded her studies for love, devoting her life to his care. So when their 30-year marriage came to an end, and Stephen Hawking, author of A Brief History Of Time, left Jane Wilde for another woman in 1990, the public was aghast: he had fallen for one of his nurses. Now Hawking’s love affair and the subsequent public disintegration of his marriage has been portrayed in a £25 million film entitled The Theory Of Everything. British actress Felicity Jones – best known as the voice of Emma Grundy in The Archers, but whose film credits include Brideshead Revisited and the romcom Chalet Girl – plays the discarded wife and Eddie Redmayne, of Birdsong fame, plays Hawking. During filming, Hawking and his ex-wife both turned up on set. It was a daunting moment. Felicity says: ‘Out of the corner of one eye I saw Jane and her new husband and out of the other eye I saw Stephen. It was probably one of the most intimidating moments of my life. It must have been so bizarre for them to watch us playing them. It certainly felt awkward for me.’ Hawking and Jane watched a sequence during which Felicity and Redmayne danced together. After the director yelled ‘Cut’, Hawking – who communicates through a computer-based speech generator – asked: ‘Would you ask Felicity if she will come and give me a kiss?’ For 31-year-old Felicity, that moment was a revelation. ‘It shows his rather flirtatious nature and this amazing capacity he has not to take himself too seriously,’ she explains. ‘I embraced him and told him, “You’re amazing!” ’ Scroll down for video . Felicity said her role involved an extraordinary depth of research, which meant spending time with Hawking and Jane themselves. Felicity says: ‘I met Jane at the Cambridge home she shares with her husband Jonathan. ‘Jane told me she always felt that Stephen’s priority had been physics rather than her. She would even describe physics as his mistress, his one true love. She said she used to joke with him, saying, “You are cheating on me with science.” Wedding day: Hawking and Jane, left, and right, Felicity and Eddie Redmayne playing them in the 2014 film . ‘It is always difficult for a couple where, as happened here, one person becomes very famous. ‘When they divorced, Jane was lost. She had given up so many of her own academic and intellectual pursuits in order to look after this man – although it was something she wanted to do – but she had become so fused with him that, when they were no longer together, she didn’t even know who she was.’ The film, for which Jones and Redmayne are tipped for Oscar nominations, tells how Hawking, who has motor neurone disease and is confined to a wheelchair, met his wife-to-be at Cambridge, and how she coaxed him out of a profound depression and fought against doctors who told the then 21-year-old he would die within two years. She put her own academic ambitions aside to support her husband while he became a ‘superstar’ in the scientific world, explaining complex theories such as the Big Bang, black holes and multi-dimensional space in layman’s language in his best-selling books. Yet while he was feted in public, at home he relied utterly upon his wife. The film is based on Jane’s memoir Travelling To Infinity: My Life With Stephen, in which she recalls: ‘He required my help with the minutiae of every personal need, dressing and bathing, as well as with larger movements. I felt like that traveller who had fallen into a black hole: stretched, tugged and pulled like a piece of spaghetti by uncontrollable forces.’ To prepare for her role, Felicity also watched endless video clips of the Hawkings during their marriage. ‘I was struck by the precision of Jane’s care for him. She took care of everything, down to the angle of the glass she would hold to his mouth. ‘It had to be tipped just so, so that he could drink and the dribble wouldn’t go all around his mouth. She had this instinct and ability to know what was best for him. In a way, after she left the academic world herself, he became her field of study. ‘That said, Jane was someone very special. She wrote a thesis on medieval Spanish poetry during the early days of their marriage. 'She had a very strong sense of her own identity but she also had extraordinary love and compassion. She has a very strong religious faith and part of that faith was about making choices and committing to them. ‘When Stephen was diagnosed with motor neurone disease she thought, “Right, I am going to stand by this person and show him as much love as I can for as long as it takes.” ’ Felicity says she jumped at the role, knowing that Jane had made a huge contribution to Hawking’s success. ‘I read about all these great men in history and there will always be a great woman in the background doing the tedious, less glamorous stuff that keeps it all together. 'These women should not be invisible.’","Hawking’s love affair will be portrayed in film The Theory Of Everything .

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will start the Italian Grand Prix on the front row of the grid, the Briton on pole, the German alongside him. Within a few gear-flicking seconds, the road will narrow at the Variante del Rettifilo and the two of them will try to thread their silver Mercedes over the corner’s kerbs in the shortest and fastest way. Both hope to reach the next corner, the flat-out Curva Biassano. But there are no guarantees that they will reach there and none they will leave. Duopoly: Lewis Hamilton managed to get the better of title rival Nico Rosberg during qualifying . Grid: Hamilton will be on pole at Monza while Mercedes team-mate Rosberg starts in second place . 1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 2. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 3. Valtteri Bottas (Williams) 4. Felipe Massa (Williams) 5. Kevin Magnussen (McLaren) 6. Jenson Button (McLaren) 7. Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 8. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 9. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) 10. Sergio Perez (Force India) In front of up to 100,000 fans in this crumpled cathedral of Italian motor racing at the centre of the tree-strewn Royal Park, the latest unmissable instalment of the 2014 world championship will unfold. Most of those here with their banners are disciples of Ferrari, the team that Enzo built into an icon of a nation, but, with the shiny scarlet cars off the pace, it is the tussle between a cerebral German and an instinctive Briton that promises to provide the greatest excitement of the afternoon. The backdrop to the race was provided a fortnight ago at Spa, where Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap. Hamilton ultimately retired from the race. Rosberg, the aggressor, survived a broken front wing to come second and increase his advantage in the championship to 29 points. Race: Mercedes say that their drivers can to battle it out between them free from team orders . The row afterwards was even more feisty. It ended up with Rosberg being fined by Mercedes and apologising to his team, his rival and seemingly the whole world. Both were warned to keep it clean, though management will permit them to race free of team orders. So after Hamilton yesterday claimed his first pole since the Spanish Grand Prix on May 10, the question was how they would race in the first few frantic moments today along the fastest lap in Formula One. Would the keep-it-clean instruction be in their minds? ‘It won’t be ringing in ‘my’ ears,’ said Hamilton. Sitting next to him, Rosberg said: ‘It’s a question I am not able to answer. The message is that we keep on racing. Every situation is different.’ Tense: The relationship between the two drivers has broken down since the Belgian Grans Prix . Hamilton was strangely underwhelmed in the post-qualifying press conference. ‘It is a great feeling to be up here,’ he said, with the enthusiasm of a dental patient mid-filling rather than somebody who had interrupted Rosberg’s run of six poles in seven races. Mercedes’ outright pace suggests they should be too strong to be challenged, yet mechanical glitches have hindered them more regularly than expected. ‘Every race is important,’ said Hamilton. ‘But time is running out. I need those points.’ All the top six — Hamilton, Rosberg, Valtteri Bottas in third, his Williams team-mate Felipe Massa and the McLaren pair of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button — are powered by Mercedes engines. Mercedes: The German team are unlikely to be troubled in Italy, unless they suffer more mechanical problems . To the disgruntlement of the Italian fans, Fernando Alonso starts in seventh place while the second Ferrari of Kimi Raikonnen was only 12th fastest. Ferrari’s recent dismal run of form led the Monza rumour-mill to suggest that Luca di Montezemolo, the 67-year-old team president, might stand down after more than 40 years with the company. But with a sweep of his hair, he dismissed tales of his demise. ‘I told the board in March that I was ready to accept three more years for my shareholders and particularly for my people, the women and men of the Ferrari,’ he said. Living up to his theatrical billing, Di Montezemolo enveloped Alonso in a long, lingering, listing hug. Another hugger was Hamilton, embracing his dad on the way to the car. There is at least some love here among the enmity.","Italian Grand Prix at Monza the latest setting for Mercedes feud .

"A test that could diagnose diabetes years earlier than the current method is being developed by scientists. The early warning could help prevent debilitating and deadly complications, such as strokes and heart attacks, blindness, kidney disease and nerve and circulatory damage. The blood test detects type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, which accounts for 90 per cent of the more than three million Britons with diabetes. A new test is being developed by scientists which could diagnose common type 2 diabetes 'years earlier' At the moment, the illness is diagnosed by testing for high sugar levels in the blood. But researchers from the University of Manchester and King’s College London say that by the time blood sugar is raised, some of the damage caused by the disease in its early stages has already been done. To find out whether testing for other compounds such as fatty molecules would give an earlier result, they studied almost 100 women who had been classed at high, medium or low risk of diabetes two years earlier. Although their blood sugar levels were normal, there were differences in other compounds in the blood, including some found in fat, as well as vitamin D and some proteins. Differences were also found in their blood vessels, with those at high risk of developing diabetes having the least healthy arteries and veins. All complications associated with diabetes – from blindness to heart attacks and strokes – are thought to stem from blood vessel damage. Scientists predict new test could be used widely within the next five years and may lead to a change in the definition of type 2 diabetes . The researchers are refining the test and say it could be used widely in five years to warn of type 2 diabetes months or even years early. Researcher Kennedy Cruickshank, of King’s College London, said: ‘The current method of categorising type 2 diabetes solely by a patient’s glucose levels means that many will already have suffered blood vessel damage and so will experience poorer outcomes.’ The new test may lead to a change in the definition of type 2 diabetes so that those who test positive are said to have it, rather than merely be at risk of it, he added. The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, could also lead to new drugs for diabetes. Professor Cruickshank said that existing treatments that focus on lowering blood sugar levels help in the short term, and patients should still take them. The news came as scientists claimed yesterday to have discovered how to ‘switch off’ autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes. Autoimmune diseases are caused when the body’s immune system overreacts, attacking its own tissue as it tries to fight disease. In research, published today in Nature Communications, a team at the University of Bristol discovered how to convert cells from being overly aggressive to acting normally and protecting against disease.","Blood test is being developed by scientists to detect most common form .

"When the talent-spotters descended on Drammen over the weekend they were not making their way to the music festival headlined by local synth pop favourites Donkeyboy and the former A-ha frontman Morten Harket. The main attraction in this small city is Martin Odegaard, a 15-year-old sparkling in midfield for champions Stromsgodset, fresh out of school and poised to break a 110-year-old record this week as the youngest footballer to represent Norway at senior level. His team were beaten on Saturday but it is easy to understand the excitement. Odegaard has the quick feet and technical class more readily associated with South American footballers. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch footage of Norway's teenage sensation in action . Future star: Martin Odegaard has been called up to Norway's senior squad for their friendly against the UAE . Debut: The talented teen made his first appearance for Stromsgodset's senior team in June 2012 . Congratulations: The midfielder's Stromsgodset team-mates applaud him during that game against Mjondalen . The ball sticks to him, the fans adore him, team-mates trust him and his boss David Nielsen likens him to Lionel Messi. ‘He has something really special,’ purrs Norway manager Per- Mathias Hogmo, who has called the teenager into a squad containing only home-based players for a friendly against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. If he handles this well, he will either stay in the squad for next week’s friendly against England at Wembley, or play for the Under 21s in a competitive game against Portugal. Everyone agrees Norwegian football has never known anything quite like it. Maturing: Odegaard has bulked up in the two years since making his bow for the Norwegian champions . There is known interest from more than 20 big-name European clubs who have requested tickets for games at Stromsgodset’s compact Marienlyst Stadion. Only the best need apply. Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid lead the hunt. Odegaard has been to England to train with Manchester United and has spent time in Germany with Bayern, Stuttgart and Borussia Dortmund. Liverpool have been in touch, aware that Martin and his father Hans-Erik are lifelong fans. On the scoresheet: The teenager nets the winner from just inside the penalty area against Haugesund in June . Fast-tracked: Odegaard could make his international debut when Norway face United Arab Emirates . Ronny Deila gave Martin his debut before leaving Drammen to become Celtic manager. And Tore Andre Flo at Chelsea’s academy should be in the loop because his brother Jostein is the director of football at Stromsgodset. ‘He’s a quality player, mature in the head and doesn’t get affected by all the hoopla that’s going on around him,’ said Nielsen. ‘The call-up is a good thing. It’s another experience for him, to go and get to know the coach there. He will be a future player for Norway. There’s no reason to wait. ‘You see these technical players involved at the big clubs and he’s going to be one of them. You can pick anybody. You can pick Lionel Messi or you can pick David Silva. He is a rare talent and we’re glad to have him.’ Odegaard’s tender years are obvious when you meet him. He smiles, he is polite and quietly spoken, a little sheepish about the erupting clamour. He says he wants to focus on the ‘small things’ and doesn’t expect to play for Norway when so many good and more experienced players are available. Watch from the stands, though, and it’s hard to tell a 15-year-old is on the pitch. His shoulders are broad and his beautiful balance and awareness keep him clear of rough stuff. More than that, it’s his confidence and body language. ‘At the beginning it was not so easy,’ said Nielsen. ‘He was playing on his own, but he’s become a team player; he’s producing goals and scoring chances. He is 15 ... playing 90 minutes every week.’ Team-mates are quick to pass to him. They look to him for inspiration. He has quick feet and tricks but doesn’t showboat. He takes set-pieces with his left foot but Nielsen lets him play in peace. There is no over-protection from the boss although he did react angrily and burst on to the pitch during Saturday’s 3-2 home defeat by Stabaek when Odegaard was brutally body-checked. He glides with the ball, with traces of a young Michael Laudrup, thanks to long practice sessions with dad Hans-Erik, who played more than 200 times for Stromsgodset as an industrious midfielder and is now assistant manager of Mjondalen in the second tier. Bhoy wonder: Celtic boss Ronny Deila encourages Odegaard while in charge of Stromsgodset last season . Hans-Erik designed coaching drills to improve his son’s vision and worked with him each day from the age of five, often in the gym during the dark and cold Norwegian winter. ‘You can see he has a good first touch and good vision, so he never gets caught by the speed of the game,’ said Hans-Erik. ‘That’s what’s good about him. You can put him up through the levels and he can adapt. ‘His strength is not good but he deals with it because he doesn’t get caught, he has such vision. I had a plan, since he was five, to train him, always with the ball, to train his vision and technique. It is one thing to see, but another to understand and react.’ World at his feet: Odegaard keeps the ball from Magne Hoseth, a Norwegian player who was tipped for a bright future as a youngster in the late nineties while playing for Molde . Martin first trained with the Stromsgodset seniors at 13 and appeared in a first-team training game against Mjondalen at the same age. ‘He has not come through quickly at all, because he’s been this good since he’s been six,’ said Nielsen. ‘There are no overnight stars. They always work hard somewhere and he’s worked really hard. ‘This is probably the 15-year-old in the world who has trained the hardest and put in the most hours. He is an exceptional training talent, it’s just unbelievable. Everything he does is quality. He trains at a different level to any other player I’ve ever seen.’ Nielsen himself made his top-flight debut in Denmark for Odense at 16 and was the subject of interest from Bayern Munich. Despite a long career it did not quite unfold as planned. Form an orderly queue: Some of Europe's top clubs have been to Norway to watch Odegaard in action . He had spells in England at Wimbledon, Norwich and Grimsby before struggling with a gambling addiction, and is well placed to offer advice, not that he thinks it will be needed. ‘That’s why we’re all so calm,’ said Nielsen. ‘We don’t stress about the media hype because we see how he is reacting. You have to be careful but he’s shown we’ve been right to play him. He’s a part of the team. He’s not a 15-year-old but a player in my squad. ‘You never know what’s going to happen down the road, but this player has got the talent and he is going to make it big-time. He is focused. He wants this and he has no distractions around him. Of course, there are always things that can happen, but we don’t think about that. We just need to guide him here and there.’ Nielsen believes the best development programme would involve at least another season in Norway before Hans-Erik and his wife Lene make a family decision. Martin has a brother, Kristoffer (17), and sisters Emilie (10) and Mari (six). Grounded: The 15-year-old could feature against England at Wembley when Norway visit on September 3 . ‘My phone has been hot,’ said Hans-Erik. ‘Since the end of May, there was just one day in July when there were no calls. The first one came last autumn. Since then it’s increased and by the time he was picked for the national team, every club knew him. ‘The big danger for every young kid is that they are satisfied too quickly. They need a hunger to im-prove. Since he was five, he has always been focused to improve. At some point he has to move on to improve more, but when that will happen I don’t know. ‘We have to see. We have feet on the ground but we know everything has taken off and there’s so much attention on him. I’ve said to all the agents and the clubs that he is too young to go alone. ‘I don’t think it’s good for any 15-year-old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language, different culture, to be alone sitting in a flat, coming in late on February nights, hungry. ‘You need a family to feel secure. So if that’s going to happen soon, we move with him. And that’s not easy because I have a job, working for my father-in-law’s textile shops, and we have a family.’","Odegaard plays in midfield for Norwegian champions Stromsgodset .

"It’s not unusual for some people to dress up their dogs in attention-grabbing coats and even miniature tutus. But any prized pup that wears an authentic spacesuit is very likely to be the best dressed canine at any dog show. Dog lovers will get the chance to buy just the outfit, because a genuine 1950s spacesuit will be up for auction in Berlin on September 13 - but they'll need to be a dedicated follow of doggy fashion, as it is expected to fetch around €8,000 (£6,317). Space walkies! A genuine 1950s spacesuit will be up for auction in Berlin on September 13 and is expected to fetch around €8,000 (£6,317). It is modelled here by a modern dog . The lace-up suit comes with an oxygen supply tube is made from a combination of cotton, nylon, aluminium and rubber. It could have been worn by space dogs Belka and Strelka during training sessions for the USSR’s Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission. The auction catalogue reads: ‘The dog space suit can be adjusted to the size of the dog at body and legs with strings. There is a ring in the front for the helmet’s insertion. Not for the faint hearted: The lace-up suit comes with an oxygen supply tube is made from a combination of cotton, nylon, aluminium and rubber . Paws for thought: The suit is believed to have been have been worn by space dogs Belka (pictured left) and Strelka (right)  during training sessions for the USSR’s Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission . ‘The tube for the oxygen supply runs along the lower side of the suit. The suit was made by RSC Energia, the largest Russian manufacturer of spacecraft and space station components.’ The suits has been marked 'T-1, 1 and I/X-61,' leading experts to assume that it has been used. Only a small number of the dog suits have survived and this one is said to be in ‘good condition’. It is approximately 28cm by 10cm by 21 cm. Belka, meaning squirrel (Left) and Strelka, meaning arrow, (right) managed returned to Earth safety in 1960 after spending a day in space . The US used chimpanzees to study the effects of gravity, while Russia selected dogs because they can be easily trained to sit for long spells of time. The dogs played a key role in paving the way for human cosmonauts and high pressure suits were developed for the canines in the 1950s to test the effects of high speed launches on them. Some tests involved dogs being strapped inside small capsules that were launched to heights of 50miles (80km) before returning to Earth by parachute. Laika the dog famously became the first animal to orbit Earth in 1957, but sadly died from stress and overheating during the mission. However, Belka, meaning squirrel, and Strelka, meaning arrow,  returned to Earth safety in 1960 after spending a day in space. They were accompanied by a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, flies and a selection of plants and fungis, all of which survived. Strelka went on to have six puppies with a dog named Pushok, who was involved in experiments on the ground. And one of their puppies, named Pushinka, meaning fluffy, was given to President John F Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline, by Nikita Khrushchev. Demonstrating a thawing in the Cold War, Pushinka had pups of her own with a Kennedy dog called Charlie. Korabl-Sputnik 2, also known as Vostok-1K No.2, was a Soviet satellite and the third test flight of the Vostok spacecraft. It was the first mission to send animals into orbit - where they returned safely back to Earth. Dogs Belka and Strelka blasted off on August 19 1960 along with a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, some flies and a variety of plants - and a TV camera on board. All the animals returned to Earth on August 20, the day after the launch. It is thought that one of the dogs suffered seizures during the fourth orbit. In July the launch vehicle of another Vostock vehicle disintegrated and dogs were killed in the capsule upon impact with the ground. The Korabl-Sputnik 2 mission paved the way for the first human orbital flight - Vostock 1 - which launched less than eight months later.","1950s spacesuit will go to auction in Berlin on September 13 .

"Mo Farah was already celebrating as he broke the tape to become the first British winner of the Great North Run for almost 30 years. He might have even dipped under the 60min mark were it not for a 'mobot' at the finish. Training partner Mike Kigen was only a heartbeat behind, but Farah, who had failed to win any of his past three road races, seemed unaware and both recorded one hour dead. The pair, who share a management company, admitted working together during the race but denied Kigen had let his friend win. Winner: Mo Farah wins the BUPA Great North Run with his teammate Mike Kigen just behind . The two ran side by side for most of the 13.1 miles from Newcastle to South Shields, with the Kenyan urging Farah on. As they embarked on the final mile Kigen encouraged his training partner. 'He was saying, 'Let's go, let's go',' said Farah. 'We had a chat before the race and I said, 'What we should do is try and go off, leave everybody else and work together to see what we can do'. 'Mike is a great athlete and in great shape. There were a couple of times I was struggling but I managed to get back to him. 'I knew if it came down to the finish I could use my sprint finish but today he actually did test me and I believe he could have run a lot faster if he had people to go with. If it wasn't for how high he thinks of me, he could have really had a go at one point.' This was another historic victory for Farah after a punishing but ultimately victorious year. Road racing, he has admitted, has been more testing than anticipated. Joy: Farah puts the trophy on top of his head as he recovers from his deflation from the London Marathon . He finished a deflated eighth in the London Marathon. He has also collapsed twice this year, setbacks he admitted gave rise to mental doubts. 'It's been a tough year,' he said, 'but to turn it around is incredible. I've learned you can push your body and do more.' The 31-year-old was narrowly beaten in a sprint finish on his Great North Run debut last year but said he learned from that defeat. He wore a woollen hat in 2013 but there was no need for headgear this time with barely a cloud in the sky over Tyneside. The weather was kind and so were the race organisers. Instead of Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele, who got the better of him last time, there was his less prolific brother Tariku while London Marathon winner Stephen Kiprotich of Uganda was below his best. The biggest threat was Kigen who opened a small gap on several occasions but did not extend his lead, even around the 10-mile mark when Farah appeared to be struggling. Success: Farah is Olympic, World and European Champion on the track and wants to continue this on the road . There were suggestions that Kigen did not press his advantage. 'My aim was not to give him too much gap and just work,' said Farah, who denied Kigen was slowing to allow him to catch up. Kigen insisted he gave maximum effort. 'I was slowing because I was tired but the last 400 metres was tough for me,' he said. 'That's why Mo won. I'm happy with second.' On an historic day for the event, which celebrated an incredible one millionth finisher, Farah broke his own half-marathon national record and became the first British winner since 1985. The name of Steve Kenyon, who won when Farah was two-years-old, was unknown to yesterday's victor and the only records music fan Kenyon is interested in now are those he sells from his stall in Bolton town centre. 'We haven't had a British winner in 29 years so it's great to change that,' said Farah. 'I didn't know we were so close to going under 60 minutes. The aim was to win the race rather than run a fast time so it's great we did both.' The reigning Olympic, world and European champion over 5,000m and 10,000m now has his sights on next year's Beijing world championships. But first there is a holiday on Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island. 'It will be nice to have a rest,' said Farah. In the women's race, Kenyan Mary Keitany won in 1:05.39, breaking Paula Radcliffe's course record set in 2003. Britain's Gemma Steel was second with a personal best of 1:08.13. Shelly Woods won the wheelchair race for the sixth time in 50min 34sec.","Mo Farah was the first British winner of the Great North run for nearly 30 years .

"Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz, who is currently promoting a new film about a homemade sex tape going public, has called the leak of nude and explicit images of dozens of female celebrities 'a major violation'. She said members of the public should consider how they would feel if they had been targeted in the wake of the iCloud hacking which saw nude images of 101 famous faces circulated on the internet. She spoke out after high-profile stars such as Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence, model Cara Delevingne and former Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay were named among those who had compromising pictures posted online after their accounts were apparently hacked. Scroll down for video . Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz (pictured on ITV's This Morning) said the apparent iCloud hacking which saw dozens of nude and explicit photographs of high-profile celebrities leaked on the internet was a 'major violation' The actress, who appeared on the daytime show with co-star Jason Segel, was promoting new film Sex Tape . Diaz made the comments today as she attended several press calls for her new film Sex Tape – which follows a couple who make a homemade explicit film only for it be accidentally distributed to their friends and family. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Diaz said: 'Whoever has done it, they will be caught and made examples of. This can happen to anyone. If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it. 'I think that people really need to look at... how would they feel if it happened to them?' Her co-star Jason Segel said: 'What happened in real life is a terrible crime. And it's very easy when you use the word ""celebrity"" to take away the human aspect but there is an actual person with a life, you know.' Technology giant Apple last night said the leaks were not a result of breaches in the security of its computer systems. The US firm said none of the cases it had so far investigated were a result of its iCloud or Find my iPhone systems being hacked but as a result of a 'very targeted attack' on the security procedures of celebrity accounts. Model Cara Delevingne (left) and Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence were both victims of the hacking . The leaking of the private photos of famous female stars sparked initial suggestions that Apple's iCloud service had been compromised to access the images and leak them across the internet. The photos have led to a backlash against the unknown hacker who is accused of violating the privacy of the women involved. A police investigation is under way to identify the culprit. Spider-Man actress Kirsten Dunst, who is also reportedly a victim of the leak, seemed to point the finger of blame when she tweeted: 'Thank you iCloud.' But in a statement Apple said: 'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilised Apple's engineers to discover the source. Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. 'None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple's systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone. 'We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz (above at the New York premiere of Sex Tape) are currently promoting the film . The film follows a couple who make a private sex tape only to find it has been accidentally shared to the public . FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said it was 'aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high-profile individuals, and is addressing the matter'. Other stars said to have been affected include Avril Lavigne, Cat Deeley and Rihanna, with actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whose movies include A Good Day To Die Hard, already acknowledging pictures in which she is featured are genuine. A piece of computer code that repeatedly guesses passwords has been found online. The script was posted to software site GitHub, but a message has since appeared saying that Apple had fixed the bug. According to the post, the script uses the top 500 most common passwords approved by Apple to try to gain access to user accounts. If successful, it would give the hacker full access to the iCloud account, including photographs. iCloud is Apple's own cloud service, a wireless storage facility that can be used to access files remotely.","Hollywood actress said people should consider how it may feel to be a victim .

"England (4-4-2): Hart; Stones, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wilshere, Sterling; Rooney, Sturridge. England begin a new era amidst an expected record low Wembley attendance with a new captain and a new line-up as they aim put the dismal World Cup behind them. Manager Roy Hodgson has chosen his starting XI for the friendly against Norway and in England's warm-up for the start of Euro 2016 qualification next week it is a glimpse of what is to come. Not content with the 4-2-3-1 formation which has been made so popular in the Premier League in recent years or the latest trend of 3-5-2, Hodgson has reverted back to the traditional 4-4-2 of old: Hart; Stones, Cahill, Jones, Baines; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wilshere, Sterling; Rooney, Sturridge.

Young gun: John Stones (centre left) will start at right back for England against Norway on Wednesday . At the moment it leaves us with many questions that will only be answered in the next two years on the road to France. Can Jack Wilshere step into the void left by Steven Gerrard in the centre of midfield, in the absence of Frank Lampard? He was challenged to by Hodgson yesterday in his pre-match press conference. Does Gary Cahill have the ability to become England's lynchpin at the back – a centre-back the national team is crying out for? The new-look defence needs a leader. Time to step up?

Top dog: Hodgson will be hoping Joe Hart (centre) shows more consistency than last season . Will Joe Hart maintain consistent form to warrant a place in goal? Can Raheem Sterling take his scintillating form for Liverpool on to the world stage? What will happen when captain Wayne Rooney is caught up in the heat of the moment? In that formation Hodgson is expecting him to drop back to help the midfield when England don't have the ball. England been handed what should be a straightforward group to qualify for Euro 2016, but they have a lot of work ahead to get punters back through the Wembley gates.

"Snugly seated in a wooden-decked speedboat, George Clooney and his bride travel the 80ft across the Grand Canal from Venice’s 13th Century city hall to the magnificent Renaissance palace that will host the reception for the most hotly awaited wedding of the year. As they glide over the emerald waters, the film star and his new wife, British lawyer Amal Alamuddin, are flanked by a procession of decorated gondolas, while onlookers line the nearby Rialto Bridge.

"King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia told a group of foreign ambassadors that terrorism needed to be fought with 'force, reason and speed' The king of Saudi Arabia has warned that  Europe and the U.S. could be ISIS's next targets unless Western government fight terrorism with 'force, reason and speed'. King Abdullah said extremists 'know no border' and could begin sweeping through countries outside of the Middle East unless action is taken. His comments, made at a reception for foreign ambassadors, came as ISIS  posted another video on social media showing the beheading of a Lebanese soldier who was captured in Syria. Although he did not mention any terrorist groups by name, King Abdullah's comments - published by state media today - appeared to be aimed at drawing Washington and NATO forces into a wider fight against the Islamic State and its supporters in the region. The group has already seized wide areas of land across Syria and Iraq. He said: 'If we ignore them, I am certain that after a month they will reach Europe and, after another month, America. 'These terrorists do not know the name of humanity and you have witnessed them severing heads and giving them to children to walk with in the street.' British officials raised the country's terror threat level Friday to 'severe', its second-highest level, because of developments in Iraq and Syria. The White House has said it does not expect the U.S. to bump up its terrorism threat warning level. He continued: 'Terrorism knows no border and its danger could affect several countries outside the Middle East. 'It is no secret to you, what they have done and what they have yet to do. I ask you to transmit this message to your leaders: ""Fight terrorism with force, reason and speed"".' While providing arms and support to Sunni militants in Syria, Saudi Arabia has denied directly funding or backing the Islamic State group. Islamic State, which declared a 'caliphate' in June in parts of Iraq and Syria under its control, has been cited as a major security threat by Western governments since posting a video in August of the beheading of U.S journalist James Foley. The group has been fighting moderate rebels, other extremists and Assad's forces in Syria for nearly three years. But, this year, violence in Iraq has spiralled out of control, reaching levels not seen since 2007, when the country was convulsed by civil war. Today, the jihadist group posted a shocking video which showed the beheading of soldier Ali al-Sayyed, a Sunni Muslim from north Lebanon. He had been seized alongside 18 others near border town Arsal earlier this month. The footage - which is too graphic to publish- shows the soldier blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back, writhing and kicking the dusty ground while a militant announces he will be killed. Another militant then beheads him. The Lebanese army declined to comment but security and Islamic State sources confirmed the latest beheading. Scroll down for video . Relatives of Lebanese soldiers, who were captured by ISIS militants in Arsal, react during a protest demanding their release.ISIS released a video today showing one of the soldiers being beheaded . Hours later, the group posted a second video showing nine other soldiers begging for their lives, urging their families to take to the streets in the next three days to demand the release of Islamist prisoners as a condition to escape al-Sayyed's fate. Earlier this month, several Syrian groups, including Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front battled the Lebanese army after the arrest of rebel commander Emad Gomaa in the border town of Arsal. Gomaa is an al-Nusra commander who switched affiliation to Islamic State but remained popular among al-Nusra fighters. The militants seized Arsal for five days before withdrawing to a mountainous border region, taking 19 captive soldiers with them. They have demanded the release of Gomaa and several Islamists jailed since a 2007 insurrection by an al Qaeda-inspired group at a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon. The soldiers were captured by Isis militants near a border town earlier this month. They carried out protests, demanding the captives' release . Meanwhile, police in Iraq said a suicide bomber drove his explosives-laden car into an army checkpoint in the town of Youssifiyah, killing 11 people, including four soldiers, and wounding at least 24 people. Youssifiyah is 12 miles south of Baghdad. Hours later, a roadside bomb targeting an army patrol killed two soldiers and wounded five in Latifiyah, a town 20 miles south of Baghdad. Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to speak to journalists. Today, Iraqi army and Kurdish forces also closed in on Islamic State fighters today in a push to break the Sunni militants' siege of the Shi'ite town of Amerli, army sources said. Earlier this month, several Syrian groups, including Islamic State and the al-Nusra Front battled the Lebanese army . Officers said Iraqi troops, militia and Kurdish peshmerga were advancing from four directions on the northern town, which has been surrounded by Islamic State forces for more than two months. Armed residents of Amerli have managed to fend off attacks by the Islamic State fighters, who regard its majority Shi'ite Turkman population as apostates. More than 15,000 people remain trapped inside. A major in the Iraqi army, who was advancing north towards Amerli from Udhaim, said progress was slow because the militants had mined the roads. He said they were around nine miles from the town, while those approaching from the north were just 3 km away. The major said he had counted the corpses of more than 40 militants killed in Iraqi air strikes on the road between Udhaim and the village of Injana.","King Abdullah made the comments at a reception for foreign ambassadors .

"Experts have managed to solve one of the biggest problems blighting Britons living at the South Pole - creating a real ale that can survive the extreme cold at the world's most inhospitable place. Brewers have now produced a special version of the British staple, which can now withstand temperatures of down to minus 90 degrees Celsius and the 10,000 mile journey from the UK. Previously ales brought there could not cope with the low temperatures on Antarctica, as it would freeze and kills its taste. Problem solved: Explorer Rob Brown will be one of those enjoying the special beer that can withstand the coldest place on Earth - the South Pole . This special beer - called Pole-Axed - is due to be shipped 10,000 miles to the Southernmost continent on the planet this week for engineers and scientists working there to enjoy. The ale, which has a secret recipe, is currently being put into plastic bottles, which will then have the air squeezed out of them. The process allows the liquid to expand when frozen and prevents the vital gas from escaping. After it reaches its destination it will be kept safe until Christmas . Day when a team of explorers will drink it as part of their celebrations. Freezing: Ale could not cope with the extreme temperatures but pole-axed stays liquid down to minus 90 degrees Celsius . Winding down: Until now Britons have been unable to enjoy ale while working near the South Pole because it would freeze and lose its taste . Propping up the bar: At last the beer can be enjoyed on Antarctica, which is being shipped in special vacuum packed bottles . Aidan Lavin and Stewart Cross developed the drink at the Platform Tavern’s Dancing Man Brewery. The pair spent a painstaking month fermenting the beer, which is based on a 200-year-old Indian Pale Ale, IPA. Their recipe includes hops imported from the North West coast of America and is fruity to the taste. Aidan, from Southampton, said the secret to its success was its 6.7 per cent alcohol content. The 32-year-old explained: 'We were asked to brew the beer by some of . the members of the Oceanography Centre who are regulars in the pub. 'We’ve never been asked to do anything like it before but we decided it would be fun and we’d give it a go. 'The beer had to withstand the a long journey and freezing temperatures so we agreed it must be strong. Merry fellows: (left/right) Stewart Cross, Rob Brown and Aidan Lavin enjoy a quick pint of the beer in the Platform Tavern, in Southampton, where the beer is produced . 'We looked at 200-year-old IPA recipes for inspiration because those . beers were created to survive being exported all the way to India. 'Our final recipe includes special hops that have been imported from America, which give it a fruity taste. 'It took 10 hours to brew and then we left it for a month to ferment, . during that time I had to check it every day to make sure it was right.' He added: 'When it was finished we let the guys from the NOC test it and . it went down really well. We’re really pleased with the result. A team from the British Antarctic Survey and the National Oceanography Centre will be conducting research at Subglacial Lake Ellsworth for three months. Mine's a pint: The beer will be sent the 10,000 miles to the southern continent, pictured, which is the coldest place on earth . They wanted a special pint for their hard work - but it would have to survive the long and freezing journey to the Antarctic. Rob Brown, from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, is one of the team who will be enjoying the beer in Antarctica. The engineer said: 'The project at Lake Ellsworth is extremely big so a beer will be well deserved at the end of it. 'We’ve never asked a brewer to do this kind of thing before but we thought it would be a nice idea. 'I’ve had a taste of it already and it’s a brilliant beer. It will be a great treat for Christmas day.'","Until now ales could not cope with the cold as it would lose its delicious taste .

"He was the Godfather of Soul, a music legend whose incendiary stage act over six decades inspired generations of performers from Mick Jagger to Michael Jackson. But the story of James Brown, now immortalised by Jagger in a £25 million biopic, Get On Up, has become even more extraordinary in death. Last night Brown’s widow Tomi Rae – the mother of his 13-year-old youngest child James Jnr – revealed for the first time the vicious battle over her husband’s £65 million fortune, how his corpse was dismembered amid a paternity row, and why his body has been moved 14 times since his death because of family feuding. Scroll down for video . Body and soul: Tomi Rae, James Brown's widow, lays a rose at his funeral - before a family feud began . Legend: The biopic, Get On Up (pictured), charts the world-famous soul singer's career in all its glory . ‘The movie gives a good depiction of my husband’s life but the drama that has unfolded since his death is more painful and outrageous than anything a scriptwriter could dream up,’ she said in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday. ‘James would be spinning in his grave if he knew the hell I’d gone through over the past eight years.’ Brown died on Christmas Day 2006. He was 73. Tomi Rae says she has been left ‘virtually penniless’ ever since as Brown’s various children – legitimate and otherwise – lawyers, hangers-on and business associates all launched legal claims on his estate. She says a will leaving half his fortune to her and the rest to a charitable foundation to help underprivileged children ‘mysteriously disappeared’ in the days following his death. Brown’s other family rely on a will the singer signed in 2000, before he married Tomi Rae and before the birth of James Jnr. This will lists Brown’s six adult children as the beneficiaries. ‘He thought he had provided for me and Little Man, as he called our son. But every piece of scum and slime came crawling out of the woodwork the day he died,’ she said. ‘There have been lawsuits and countersuits... I know I will prevail eventually, but I’m in a living hell.’ Tomi Rae was just 25 when she became Brown’s backing singer. The genius behind hits including I Feel Good and Sex Machine was 64 and already three times divorced. The pair wed in December 2001, when son James Jnr was six months old. But after Brown died, his other children – there are at least six and up to as many as nine, depending on who you believe (the number keeps rising as others come forward claiming he was their father) – challenged James Jnr’s legitimacy, claiming Brown had undergone a vasectomy in the 1980s. Telling the story: Mick Jagger, pictured with one of James Brown's sons Also, has made a biopic . A judge ordered a DNA test which confirmed Brown was James Jnr’s father. Tomi Rae’s eyes welled up as she recalled the episode: ‘They couldn’t do the normal DNA test because of all the embalming fluid in his body. So they had to cut off his legs to get to his bone marrow. I wept uncontrollably when I found out. My husband, the greatest dancer in the world, had his legs hacked off in death.’ But the macabre farce continued. The great soul singer’s body was moved 14 times in the six months after his death, ending up in a temporary grave in the garden of his eldest daughter Deanna’s home in Georgia. ‘That is the final insult to James,’ said Tomi Rae. ‘He and I would often talk about his legacy. He wanted our home – a 230-acre estate on Beech Island in South Carolina – to be turned into a living memorial, like Graceland. That’s where he wanted a proper mausoleum. ‘But when James died, I was in California. When I returned home, the house was locked with chains on the gate. The people who had taken charge had plundered the place. They auctioned off some stuff and family members went through like locusts stripping everything that wasn’t nailed down.’ She says the first time she has been inside the house they shared since his Christmas Day death in 2006 was a few week ago after the movie’s premiere in Augusta, Georgia. ‘I walked through and just wanted to weep. The Christmas tree was still up, but the presents under the tree from my husband to our son had been opened and ransacked. They’d taken all my jewellery, clothes, furs, all James’s awards.’ Tomi Rae is now resigned to the fact that the legal wrangling could go on for years, saying: ‘My husband was a prolific womaniser. There are the children we know about but there are more and more people coming out of the woodwork claiming to be his. They are doing DNA testing all the time.’ Tomi Rae, who was hired by Jagger to be a consultant for the new film, is now working with the Rolling Stones star and his team on a two-hour documentary which will tell the story of the battle over Brown’s estate. Brown was raised in a brothel by his aunt after his mother abandoned him as an infant and his abusive father refused to care for him. It was this rejection that is believed to have led to him becoming a ‘control freak’ in later life. Caring: The soul legend 'never forgot where he came from', wanting to help his family and those in poverty . ‘He always insisted on being called Mr Brown, even by me,’ she smiles. ‘It was about respect. This was a man who came from nothing, who dragged himself up by his bootstraps. He had talent but he was ahead of his time. ‘Before James Brown, black artists didn’t cross over into the mainstream. Before James Brown, black artists didn’t control their own music. He was a control freak. ‘He hated swearing. When I swore he would fine me. He just wanted people to respect him. That’s what makes what has happened since his death all the more painful. ‘They have disrespected his final wishes – to take care of me and his son – and they have disrespected his body. ‘James cared passionately about money. He knew what he wanted his legacy to be. He wanted to take care of me and Little Man and the rest would go to a charity helping underprivileged children. ‘James never forgot where he came from. He wanted to help poor kids, white and black. He knew what it was like to be hungry and have no shoes on his feet. He often said he wasn’t going to leave money to his older kids because he didn’t want them living off his legacy.’ In later life Brown struggled with prostate cancer, diabetes and a failing libido. ‘I nursed him through the cancer,’ said Tomi Rae. ‘He had arthritis and found it hard to do the splits on stage any more. He was using drugs to numb the pain. He needed Viagra to perform on stage and in bed. He said it gave him extra energy in both places.’ She says her husband would explode in violent rages. ‘I forgave him because I knew it wasn’t personal,’ she said. ‘I was the only one in his circle who wasn’t a “yes man”. I would disagree with him and he’d throw things and explode in anger. But he wasn’t a wife beater. He was just a tired, sick, frustrated man and I understood that. I forgave the anger and violence. I truly loved him.’ Brown was also prone to intense jealousy. Tomi Rae added: ‘He built a brick wall around our pool so none of the workers in the house would see me in my bikini.’ She believes that drugs may have contributed to her husband’s death. ‘James was smoking a lot of pot but I could smell something else in there. I confronted him about it [Brown had a previous addiction to PCP or ‘angel dust’ and had freebased cocaine] but he shrugged it off. I think the second I was out of there, James was smoking pot laced with other, stronger drugs. Icon: Tomi Rae said he would 'turn in his grave' if he knew the trauma the family had gone through . ‘I think it was a lethal combination that killed him. People always wanted to party with James and keep him high. Was my husband murdered? We will never know but I will believe he most certainly was until my dying day.’ Tomi Rae and James Jnr now live in Las Vegas, where she works as a Janis Joplin impersonator. ‘I’ve been forced to busk on the streets at times to make ends meet,’ she said. ‘I’m broke.’ She says Jagger has become a ‘father figure’ to her son. The pair held a mock ‘dance-off’ after the New York premiere of the film. The movie is generating Oscar buzz, especially for Chadwick Boseman whose performance as Brown has been lauded by critics. Tomi Rae added: ‘James was someone who believed everyone was out to take get their hands on his money. In death he’s been proven right. ‘The only person who has behaved decently is Mr Jagger. ‘As for the rest of my husband’s family and so-called friends, they can rot in hell.’","Grieving widow of Get On Up legend opens up about posthumous DNA test .

"Hospital staff in Northern Virginia are turning away sick people on a frigid Thursday morning because they can't determine whether their Obamacare insurance plans are in effect. Patients in a close-in DC suburb who think they've signed up for new insurance plans are struggling to show their December enrollments are in force, and health care administrators aren't taking their word for it. In place of quick service and painless billing, these Virginians are now facing the threat of sticker-shock that comes with bills they can't afford. 'They had no idea if my insurance was active or not!' a coughing Maria Galvez told MailOnline outside the Inova Healthplex facility in the town of Springfield. She was leaving the building without getting a needed chest x-ray. 'The people in there told me that since I didn't have an insurance card, I would be billed for the whole cost of the x-ray,' Galvez said, her young daughter in tow. 'It's not fair – you know, I signed up last week like I was supposed to.' The x-ray's cost, she was told, would likely be more than $500. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Going home: One patient left the hospital without being admitted for chest pains after she was warned she might have to pay full-price. She asked MailOnline not to publish a photograph of her face . MailOnline spoke to patients outside hospitals in Virginia's Washington, D.C. suburbs, many of them confused about the state of their insurance coverage . Galvez said she enrolled in a Carefirst Blue Cross bronze plan at a cost of about $450 per month through healthcare.gov, three days before Christmas. 'No one has sent me a bill,' she said. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified in a December 11 congressional hearing that the federal government can't say how many new enrollees have written checks for their first month's premiums. 'Some may have paid, some may have not,' she conceded. It's unlikely that a valid insurance card would have changed Galvez' fortunes, however. Fifty-nine percent of Americans told Gallup pollsters that they have had negative experiences with the Affordable Care Act, according to the public opinion giant's latest survey. Just 39 per cent said their experiences were positive. Only 7 per cent called their Obamacare journeys 'very positive,' but 29 per cent said their interaction with the new system has been 'very negative.' Gallup interviewed 1,500 uninsured Americans in December, 450 of whom said they had visited health insurance exchange websites. As dismal as those numbers are, they represent a slight improvement: In November, Gallup found that 63 per cent of uninsured Americans had negative experiences with the president's new health care overhaul. Her Carefirst plan, identified on the Obamacare website as BlueChoice Plus Bronze, carries a $5,500 per-person deductible for 2014 – an amount she would have to pay out-of-pocket before her coverage would apply to medical expenses. The Inova radiology department wouldn't speak with MailOnline, and Carefirst did not respond to a request for comment. A similar situation frustrated Mary, an African-American small businesswoman who asked MailOnline not to publish her last name. She was leaving the Inova Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia with two family members. 'I had chest pains last night, and they took me in the emergency room,' Mary said. 'They told me they were going to admit me, but when I told them I hadn't heard from my insurance company since I signed up, they changed their tune.' She told MailOnline that a nurse advised her that her bill would go up by at least $3,000 if she were admitted for a day, and her doctor told her the decision was up to her. No x-ray for you: This patient left a Virginia medical facility without receiving a test her doctor recommended . 'Should I be in the hospital? Probably,' she said. 'Maybe it's one of those borderline cases. I have to think that if I were really in danger, they wouldn't give me the choice. But what if I think I'm covered and I'm really not?' 'The emergency room bill is going to be bad enough.' No card, no service: Hundreds of thousands of Americans are likely in health-insurance limbo with no proof of insurance as the new year begins . The Obamacare system has suffered from a long list of setbacks since its October 1 rollout, starting with an inoperable website and ending with rampant uncertainty about whether Americans who enrolled are actually covered. 'We're telling consumers if they're not sure if they're enrolled they should call the insurer directly,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney old reporters on December 2. The Washington Post reported that day that because of computer glitches in the 'back end' of healthcare.gov, enrollment records for as many as one-third of new insurance customers were corrupted or otherwise contain errors. Given the Obama administration's latest claim that 2.1 million have signed up nationwide, that means as many as 700,000 Americans might falsely believe they have a current health insurance policy. Mary and others like her, who took the time to enroll but may not follow the daily flood of news about Obamacare, likely don't know one way or the other. 'Why is this so complicated?' she asked. 'I had my own private insurance last year, but they cancelled me in November. I'm not sure which end is up.' Private industry estimates put the number of policy cancellations as high as 4.7 million in the last quarter of 2013, mostly involving health care plans that didn't meet the Affordable Care Act's strict minimum standards. Democrats serving on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce dispute that number, saying in a new report that no more than 10,000 will wind up without affordable insurance options after losing their old policies. The Inova Healthplex in Springfield, Virginia offers free valet parking, but if you want to see a doctor you'll need proof that you've paid your Obamacare premium . Still working: Emergency services are still being provided at Northern Virginia hospitals, whether or not patients can prove they're covered -- but getting a bed in a hospital ward could come with a tremendous sticker-shock . President Obama has attracted widespread criticism, and a 'lie of the year' award from one newspaper's fact-checker, for promising that Americans who liked their health plans would be allowed to keep them. Dr. John Venetos, a Chicago gastroenterologist, told the Associated Press on Thursday that he is seeing 'tremendous uncertainty and anxiety' among his patients who signed up for Obamacare plans but don't have insurance cards. 'They’re not sure if they have coverage,' Venetos said. 'It puts the heavy work on the physician.' 'At some point, every practice is going to make a decision about how long can they continue to see these patients for free if they are not getting paid.'","MailOnline spoke with patients who were told they would have to pay their bills in full if they couldn't prove they had insurance .

"A Liberian man in his 40s is being tested for the deadly Ebola virus in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos, a megacity of 21 million people, the Lagos State Health Ministry said. This would be the first recorded case of one of the world's deadliest diseases in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and most populous nation with 170 million people. The news comes after it was revealed that the head doctor fighting the deadly tropical virus in Sierra Leone has himself caught the disease, according to the president's office. Scroll down for video . A Liberian man in his 40s is being tested for the deadly Ebola virus in Nigeria's commercial capital of Lagos (pictured) Thirty-nine-year-old Sheik Umar Khan, hailed as a 'national hero' by the health ministry, was leading the fight to control an outbreak that has killed 206 people in the West African country. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola which can kill up to 90 percent of those infected, although the mortality rate of the current outbreak is lower at around 60 percent. Sheik Umar Khan was leading the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone - but has now contracted the disease . Across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, 632 people have died from the illness, according to the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) data, putting great strain on the health systems of some of Africa's poorest countries. The WHO report, released on Saturday, showed that there were 19 new deaths and 67 new cases within the four days since its previous statement. Khan, a Sierra Leonean virologist credited with treating more than 100 Ebola victims, has been transferred to a treatment ward run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, according to a statement released late on Tuesday by the president's office. A source at the ward confirmed that the doctor was alive and receiving treatment, but gave no details of his condition. Health Minister Miatta Kargbo called Khan a national hero and said she would 'do anything and everything in my power to ensure he survives'. It was not immediately clear how Khan had caught the virus. His colleagues told Reuters that he was always meticulous with protection, wearing overalls, mask, gloves and special footwear. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola (pictured) which can kill up to 90 percent of those infected . During a Reuters visit to the Kenema treatment centre in eastern Sierra Leone in late June, Khan said he had installed a mirror in his office, which he called his 'policeman', to check for holes or exposure before entering an isolation ward. Nevertheless, Khan said he was worried about contracting Ebola. 'I am afraid for my life, I must say, because I cherish my life,' he said in an interview, showing no signs of ill health at the time. 'Health workers are prone to the disease because we are the first port of call for somebody who is sickened by disease. Even with the full protective clothing you put on, you are at risk.' Three days ago, three nurses working in the same Ebola treatment centre alongside Khan died from the disease. The Ebola outbreak started in Guinea's remote southeast in February and has since spread across the region. Symptoms of the highly infectious disease are diarrhoea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.","Sheik Umar Khan was hailed as a 'national hero' by the health ministry .

"As Big Ben chimed and we celebrated – or mourned – the passing of deadline day at 11pm, the transfer window, as it does, slammed shut. Only, it didn’t. In fact, it remained wedged open for another two hours. That was long enough for Newcastle’s Hatem Ben Arfa to dive head first through the opening at Hull City, and Radamel Falcao to slip underneath the frame at Old Trafford. So how does that work? Can we never sleep easy following deadline day again? Is that window always ajar? Sportsmail reveals just how clubs can get round the deadline to sign players... VIDEO Scroll down to see Cristiano Ronaldo's thoughts on Falcao & Di Maria . Deadline day deal: Radamel Falcao poses outside Manchester United's training ground after his sensational loan transfer to Old Trafford . Right, Monday was ‘deadline day’ – but when was the damned deadline? It is still 11pm. Domestic transfers, however, can be granted an extension until 1am, and international transfers until midnight. We’re going to need more than that, so can you just sign a player at 11.30pm? No – a ‘deal sheet’ must be submitted to the Premier League before 11pm. So, in effect, that is still the deadline for all parties agreeing to a transfer and putting their approval to a sheet which says it is going to happen. If the Premier League has this by 11pm then they will grant an extension to finalise all other paperwork. So no, Louis van Gaal cannot decide at 11.30pm that he still needs a centre-back and start ringing around. He should have done that at 1.30pm… . Had Van Gaal gone to bed? Falcao poses with Manchester United assistant manager Ryan Giggs . What else needs to be finalised? The ‘deal sheet’ is an emergency measure which can only be used after 9pm and no later than 11pm. After that documents such as the contract, the transfer agreement and permission to work in the UK must be submitted. The deal sheet: The vital piece of paperwork clubs need to complete before 11pm . Why do domestic transfers get an extra hour extra compared with international deals? The Premier League allows two hours – that is their decision – but international transfers must comply with the FIFA Transfer Matching System (TMS) deadline of midnight. What is that? FIFA’s TMS is an online database to which all information must be uploaded for the transfer to gain international clearance. Late show: Hatem Ben Arfa (right) was spotted in discussions with Hull well after the 11pm deadline . So what did happen with Falcao and Ben Arfa? Falcao was a little different to Ben Arfa in that his deal had been agreed earlier in the day and it just took a little time to complete his medical and other formalities before a belated announcement. But Ben Arfa was your classic deadline-day dash. We were being kept up-to-speed on the move throughout and there was a little concern at one stage that the extension would pass without all paperwork being submitted. Ben Arfa left Tyneside at around 7.30pm – taking in the A19 and a traffic jam in York. Meanwhile, a ‘deal sheet’ was being faxed to the Premier League and that allowed the extra two hours to agree the terms of the season-long loan deal once Ben Arfa had finally arrived at Hull’s training ground. Roaring success: Hull showed off their new boy well after midnight as Ben Arfa posed with a shirt . And what about Marcos Rojo at Manchester United? Rojo’s £16m move from Sporting Lisbon is complete, at least from a footballing perspective. He was given an international certificate by the Football Association and arrived in England last week on a tourist visa to finalise the deal. But that is where the problem lies. Immigration laws require that those entering the country to work do so with a working visa. And embassy officials will first look into details of an alleged altercation with a neighbour in Argentina in 2010 before issuing the working visa, as the incident is still being investigated by police. We're still waiting: Marcos Rojo (left) joined United over a week ago but his visa is still not finalised . So Rojo should be OK, but what happened with Manchester City’s John Guidetti at Celtic? The Sweden striker was set to join the Hoops on loan and had travelled to Glasgow to complete the deal. But the move collapsed just after midnight with both City and Celtic having failed to allow the Scottish FA the time needed to process the transfer. There is, however, the possibility of the SFA appealing to FIFA over the circumstances of the delay. Too late: John Guidetti leaves Celtic Park after  talks with the club, but his move was not completed . So after all of that, should the deadline not just be 11pm on ‘deadline day’? The fact that some deals can be completed the following day (i.e. after midnight) doesn’t seem right. Certainly, West Ham chairman David Gold thinks so,  tweeting his agreement with the statement: ‘Am I the only one that thinks there should not be extensions… There is a deadline for a reason’. Take that up with the Premier League, David. In the meantime, you know where to come for any deadline-day queries… .","Summer transfer window ended at 11pm on  'deadline day'

"It is 60 years to the day since she learned her beloved father, George VI, had died suddenly. In a heartbeat the strong, dutiful – but still unbelievably young – woman of 25 was thrust on to the world stage. Now aged 85, the Queen is a proud grandmother eight times over, with one great-grandchild and another on the way. Long to reign over us: The new portrait of the Queen and Prince Philip by photographer John Swannell that has been released on the 60th anniversary of Her Majesty's accession to the throne . Today, however, she makes clear that thoughts of retirement are far from her mind as she formally rededicates herself to her nation. In a statement to mark the start of her diamond jubilee year, the Queen – only the second monarch after her great great grandmother Queen Victoria to celebrate 60 years on the British throne – vows once again to serve her people for the rest of her life. Her message is interesting because, unlike addresses issued to mark her silver and golden jubilees, the Queen takes the opportunity to rededicate herself to her people, scotching rumours that she might abdicate in favour of her son and heir, Prince Charles. She also hopes the dozens of planned commemorative events do more than just celebrate her milestone but remind us in times of economic crisis and social breakdown of the importance of family, friends and ‘good neighbourliness’. In the statement, issued by Buckingham Palace, she says she and Prince Philip have been ‘deeply moved to receive so many kind messages about the diamond jubilee’. She continues: ‘In this special year, as I dedicate myself anew to your service, I hope that we will all be reminded of the power of togetherness and the convening strength of family, friendship and good neighbourliness. ‘I hope also that this jubilee year . will be a time to give thanks for the great advances that have been made . since 1952 and to look forward to the future with clear head and warm . heart as we join together in our celebrations.’ Royal visit: The Queen attended church near Sandringham alongside her husband yesterday as the couple prepared for the anniversary . Smiles: Prince Philip and The Queen looked happy ahead of the church service despite the freezing weather . Meet and greet: The Royal couple were offered flowers by children following the service, with one young boy even offering a packet of Werther's Originals to the Prince . On the eve of today’s commemorations, the Queen and Philip yesterday attended a service at the church on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Today, unusually, she will spend the anniversary of her accession in public, conducting a series of engagements close to Sandringham, after a private mass at which she will remember the gentle father she idolised. First she will visit King’s Lynn town hall before travelling to Dersingham Infant and Nursery School where she will watch a play about her 60 years as sovereign performed by the children. A new picture of the Queen and Philip has also been issued to celebrate her milestone. Close: The then Princess Elizabeth is pictured with her father George VI in April 1944. Despite continuing health problems he died suddenly . Accession: Dressed in black, Her Majesty arrives back in the UK from a Kenya in February 7, 1952, the day after she heard of her father's death while on a state visit to the country . Celebrations: The Queen is seen during her Golden Jubilee in 2002, left, while he laughs after being given this posy of flowers during the 1977 Silver Jubilee . Taken at Buckingham Palace in December by photographer John Swannell, it shows the Queen in a dress of white silk, satin and lace with the 1820 state diadem on her head, while Philip wears the Royal Navy ceremonial day dress of an Admiral of the Fleet with his Garter sash. Former prime minister Sir John Major yesterday dismissed any suggestion that the Queen would ever relinquish the throne early or that Prince William would be the next king. ‘The Queen took an oath at the coronation that she would remain as Queen for the rest of her life,’ he said. ‘When, hopefully many years hence, the Queen is no longer with us, Prince Charles will become king. ‘After Prince Charles will come Prince William. That is, I think, a matter that is beyond doubt.’","New portrait of Royal couple released to mark the occasion .

"Europe has an estimated 421 million fewer birds today than it did 30 years ago as modern farming methods and urbanisation have caused their habitats to vanish, according to a new study. Most of the birds lost, around 90 per cent, have been the most common and widespread species, including sparrows, skylarks, grey partridges and starlings. Scientists believe the population crash can be linked to modern farming methods and deteriorating and fragmenting habitats. Declining: Common birds such as starlings (pictured) are declining in numbers as scientists find Europe has an estimated 421 million fewer birds today than it did 30 years ago . 'It is very worrying that the most common species of bird are declining rapidly because it is this group of birds that people benefit from the most,' said Dr Richard Inger, one of the researchers from the University of Exeter. 'It is becoming increasingly clear that interaction with the natural world and wildlife is central to human well-being, and significant loss of common birds could be quite detrimental to human society.' However, the study found that not all common birds are declining and populations of great tits, blue tits, robins and blackbirds, are all going up. Risk: Around 90 per cent of the birds lost have been common species, such as starlings which were seen creating shape-shifting cloud formations above the rooftops of Longtown, Cumbria, earlier this week . In decline: Scientists believe the population crash can be linked to modern farming methods and deteriorating and fragmenting habitats . Rare species such as marsh harriers, ravens, buzzards, storks and stone curlews had also shown increases in recent years, which researchers said was probably due to conservation efforts. The research, co-led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), is published in the journal Ecology Letters. 'The rarer birds in this study, whose populations are increasing, have benefited from protection across Europe,' said Dr Richard Gregory, from the RSPB's Centre for Conservation Science. Encouragement: Populations of great tits, blue tits (pictured), robins and blackbirds, are all going up . Flying high: Rare species such as marsh harriers (left) and ravens (right) are also increasing in number . 'For example, white storks and marsh harriers receive among the highest level of protection in the EU - this is why their numbers have increased. 'The conservation and legal protection of all birds and their habitats in tandem are essential to reverse declines. 'This is a warning from birds throughout Europe. It is clear that the way we are managing the environment is unsustainable for many of our most familiar species.' Worry: Dr Richard Inger said it is worrying that the most common species of bird, such as starlings, are declining rapidly because 'it is this group of birds that people benefit from the most' Dr Inger said that 'interaction with the natural world and wildlife is central to human well-being', so losing vast numbers of common birds could be 'detrimental to human society' The scientists analysed data on 144 species of European birds collected from numerous surveys in 25 different countries. Much of the information was provided by thousands of volunteer fieldworkers who identified and counted birds in the areas where they lived. The researchers concluded that more conservation should be directed at wider-scale environmental improvement, such as urban green space projects and effective environmental schemes aimed at farmland.

"Parents and teachers are being warned that punishing children for their aggressive behaviour is only adding to fuel to the fire in the schoolyard. The harsh disciplinary actions of adults are being labelled as partly to blame for children becoming bullies as evidence reveals decades of teaching intervention methods in schools is simply not working.

Scroll down for video . Parents and teachers are being warned that punishing children for their aggressive behaviour is only adding to fuel to the fire in the schoolyard . Two thirds of the anti - bullying strategies taught to children at school are not working while only one third had a modest effect . ‘We live in a bullying culture where the people at the top are doing exactly what they are telling everybody else not to do and they don’t realise they are doing it,’ he said. 'Our methods of discpline and our methods of promoting anti-bullying messages are actually promoting bullying.'

Dr Coulson, who is speaking at a the National Centre Against Bullying conference in Melbourne on Wednesday, suggests that adults refrain from their natural urge to react and speak with their child. 'We are actually ignoring what’s going on underneath - instead we are trying to patch it up with a bandaid,' he said.

Dr Coulson, a father of six who left a career in radio to undertake a psychology degree to become a better parent, said parents and teachers need to work together with the child. 'Although sometimes it feels like being punitive is the only option, the first thing you need to say is 'you're not in trouble' then you need to collaborate together on the problem solving.'

"An architect has lovingly built an incredible floating home which is part contemporary box and part warehouse to indulge his love of the water. Mike Villiot, a retired contractor and his . son, Matt, spent a year building the house which is located on Lake Union at . the Northlake Shipyard in Seattle. The stunning floating home was designed by Dan Nelson of Designs Northwest Architects for Mr Villiot and his wife Kris. Stunning: It took a year to build the contemporary-meets-wharf-warehouse home in Seattle . The couple gave up a 4,000-square-foot home in North Seattle for life on the water and have lived on the lake since November 2008. They describe themselves as ‘water people’ who love nothing more than messing around on the lake. They reveal that they welcomed the change in lifestyle that their ‘impulse’ buy of a slip gave them. ‘The boys were gone and we both were working and doing a bad job of taking care of our house,’ Mrs Villiot told The Seattle Times. 'We went to some open houses. This was an impulse buy,' he added. Their incredible one of a kind house on a dock holds eight newer homes that sit behind a locked gate. But its unusual exterior tends to attract a good deal of gawping and stares from passers-by who are always keen to take a closer look. ‘It’s a lot less private in summer’ Mrs Villiot said. ‘But we’re used to waving at boaters.’ What a view! The living room opens completely onto Lake Union with two automatic garage doors . Bedroom: The guest bedroom is open to its surrounding dockside views and anchored in walls of bookshelves . Lake Union home: The spiral staircase winds up to the rooftop deck complete with a putting green, the exterior of the home is Trespa (a plastic-laminate composite) vertically banded with Western red cedar battens, which gives it that crate-like effect  says architect Dan Nelson . The Villiott’s floating home has two bedrooms, 2½ baths and is under 2,000 square feet and sits on a float of Styrofoam surrounded by concrete. The quirky, modern design by Nelson combines the look of a warehouse along the wharf, with a wooden look and a rugged exterior. The house features a signature external metal spiral staircase and a 30-by-40-foot rooftop patio with a fair(way)-sized putting green. The main living spaces are at water level with two garage doors to remove separation from living room and lake. The second floor has a master suite, laundry, den and a guest room. Spectacular: The kitchen is earthy and active with vertically placed (and perfectly matched) zebrawood cabinets crafted by Jonathan Pauls in Georgetown, the counter, also a dining table for eight, is granite outlined in steel . Bathroom: Tiny glass tiles lining the walls of the main-floor powder room cast a shimmer much like the sun glinting off the lake on a bright day . Hallway: A large skylight drives light through the home. The painting on the left is by Cathy Schoenberg of Guemes Island . Porthole: Open stairs to the private spaces keep the eye moving through the main living area and a porthole windows over the desk are a natural for life on the lake . The interior was created by Susan Broll of Susan Broll Interior Design who worked in warm colours. The pair say that they enjoy the surrounding community. Their home is within walking distance of Capitol Hill, downtown and the Seattle Center. When the weather warms up they enjoy the lake itself which is suitable for a nice dip.

"A mother has beaten odds of a million-to-one by giving birth to a baby who appears to be of a different race. Catherine Howarth, 32, from Milton Keynes, is Nigerian by heritage, and so was, at first, a little taken aback when she saw her son Jonah for the first time. With his pale skin, green eyes and light brown hair, Jonah, now three months old, looks like any other new-born baby - but, when seen in his mother's arms, his uniqueness is obvious. Recalling the moment she delivered Jonah in Milton Keynes Hospital on June 1, his mother told the Sunday Mirror: ‘The midwife looked at me and looked back down at Jonah and then at me again and couldn’t believe it.' Scroll down for video . Father Richard (l) and mother Catherine (r) say all that matters is that Jonah (c) is healthy . ‘Some children get darker after a few weeks when the skin colour they will have for life starts to become obvious. But you can see from the colour at the tips of their ears what that Jonah was fully white. ‘We have been told I must have been carrying a recessive gene. My parents were from Nigeria and, for as far back as anyone can remember; my family have all been black.’ The difference between mother and son is extreme, and doctors believe it may be due to a single gene . Skin colour is a very strong example of genetic influence. It depends on the amount of the pigment melanin found in the skin cells, and this amount is predetermined by the genetic blueprint of each cell. There are an infinite number of different skin colours, known as phenotypes. These range through black, dark brown, brown, light brown to white skin. Each expression of melanin has an accumulating effect on skin tone - in other words, the more there is in each parent's genes, the darker that person will be. Therefore, a baby's colour will usually depend on the predominating amount of melanin in their parents. Although again, it is possible, though fairly infrequent, that dark-skinned parents give birth to a pale-skinned child, or vice versa, if their own parents or grandparentsare paler or lighter than they are. Husband Richard, 34, who works as a medical recruitment consultant, was equally as shocked when he first saw his son, who is the couple’s first child together. However, he was primarily just happy that Jonah was strong and healthy, after he got the umbilical cord tangled round his neck during labour – a potentially dangerous complication. ‘The colour of Jonah’s skin is of no concern - Jonah being a healthy and happy baby is what matters.’ The couple have been told that they are unlikely to have another white baby if they have further children, due to the extremely rare combination of genes needed. The phenomenon is not totally unheard of however. In 2010, parents Benjaman and Angela Ihegboro – both black - introduced their white-skinned, blonde-haired daughter Nmachi to the world. The couple, from Woolwich, South London, was as baffled as the scientific community at their daughter's appearance, being unaware of any white heritage at all in either family. In 2010  little Nmachi (centre) was born to parents Benjaman and Angela Ihegboro . Doctors at Queen Mary Hospital in Sidcup in Kent, where Nmachi was born, immediately ruled out albinism, leading experts to conclude, that like Jonah, Nmachi’s colouring must be the result of recessive genes.

"Despite being rivals in both their careers and love lives, new letters by Bobby Kennedy (right) reveal he admired his elder brother John . He may have been a member of the charismatic Kennedy family, but new letters penned by a teenage Bobby Kennedy reveal he worried about not being able to attract women. Writing to school-friend Peter MacLellan in 1944, Bobby confessed that he was 'chasing women madly' but added: 'it seems as if I lack the Kennedy charm.' In the letters, which have remained hidden for almost 70 years, Bobby also speaks of his admiration for his older brother, John, and his war heroics. In one letter, Bobby writes: 'I’m going home this weekend to see my brother Jack who is now going into PT (patrol torpedo) boats...so I’m getting out to see him because he might be killed any minute.' Later, a boat John F Kennedy was commanding sunk after being rammed by a Japanese destroyer. John saved the life of one of his men by swimming to safety with his life-vest belt held in his teeth, prompting Bobby to write, asking: 'Did you see [John's] story about the boat?' While Bobby's love life would later become the stuff of legend, with biographers claiming he had affairs with with Marilyn Monroe and his brother's widow, during his early years he worried about attracting women. On July 3, 1944, he wrote to Mr MacLellan, saying: 'I am now chasing women madly but it looks as if I lack the Kennedy charm as I have yet to find a girl who likes me. 'But then I don’t quit easily so I’m still in there struggling. How’s that love life of yours?' The letters also show Bobby's funny side. In one he teases his friend, singing off: 'From your mental & physical superior and your better in football, hockey and baseball, Robert Francis Kennedy.' In another, he writes 'I’m still healthy, strong . . . and good looking as ever', reports the Boston Globe. While the letters show Bobby's sporting ability may not have matched that of his brothers, he praises his younger sibling Teddy. In the letters Bobby discusses going back to visit his elder brother before he goes to fight in the Second World War, saying 'he could be killed any minute' (pictured) Despite claims about Bobby's (left) later love life, including an affair with Marilyn Monroe (centre), in his teenage letters he worried about success with ladies, writing that 'it seems I lack the Kennedy charm' He says: 'Football is going stinky due to the fact there’s a guy on 2nd team ahead of me who can play ball as well as Teddy, my brother, and the coach thinks he’s better than me. 'I guess no one appreciates my true qualities . . . The whole thing can go to Hell.' Mr MacLellan, who dated Kennedy's sister Jean for a time, has kept the notes hidden in a bureau in his bedroom, still stuffed inside their original envelopes. However, now aged 90, he has decided to put them up for auction before he passes away. The letters from Bobby will go up for sale on September 18 at RR Auctions in Boston, along with a set of letters written by John F Kennedy. The letters from John Kennedy were written to the family of Harold Marney, one of the sailors killed after Kennedy's boat was sunk during the Second World War. In the letters Bobby also laments his lack of sporting abilities after being dropped from his school's baseball team, though he praises his younger brother Teddy as a football player . At first the Marney family write to John asking for news of their son, who was officially listed as missing in action, and he writes back offering his condolences. However, after Joe Kennedy was killed in an air crash, the roles are reversed as the Marneys wrote to John offering their own sympathies for his loss. John F. Kennedy's letters are expected to fetch $40,000, while bids for Robert Kennedy's correspondence are expected to reach $20,000.","Bobby Kennedy wrote letters to school-friend Peter MacLellan in the Forties .

"With Ann Curry reportedly falling victim to the ratings war between GMA and the Today show, her colleague Hoda Kotb has emerged as the front-runner to replace her as anchor. Sources at NBC claim that Curry could leave as early as next week and Kotb, who hosts the fourth hour of Today with Kathie Lee Gifford is being touted as the Curry's replacement to sit alongside Matt Lauer. Kotb, who has been with NBC since 1998 is said to be seen by executives at the Peacock network to offer a seamless transition for Today, as it battles to re-establish its 16-year-long supremacy over GMA in the ratings. Hoda Kotb has emerged as the front-runner to replace outgoing Today show anchor Ann Curry . 'Hoda has a hard news background but is extremely comfortable discussing pop culture issues,' said the NBC insider to Radaronline.com. 'She just has a warmth that viewers find comforting. She was very public with her breast cancer battle, and allowed cameras to follow her during her cancer treatments on Today. 'Hoda is a team player, and is so well liked by everyone at the show, most importantly, Matt Lauer. 'They have a very easy rapport and mutual respect. Hoda even recently interviewed Matt for a Hamptons Magazine profile on him.' Taking the rap for the falling ratings at the Today show, Curry's lack of chemistry with Lauer is seen by executives at NBC as the major cause of her contract being terminated. Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford who currently host the fourth hour of the Today show together . Kotb, meanwhile, has been gushing with her praise of Lauer, who recently signed up to a $25 million contract extension with Today. Ann Curry on NBC's 'Today' at Rockefeller Center in New York last week. She is expected to be replaced as co-anchor on the program as early as next week . 'Matt is hands-down the most talented journalist I have ever seen, and he is one of the funniest people I know,' said Kotb in a Hamptons Magazine profile about Lauer. 'He is also compassionate, and I think it's that characteristic that drives him to motivate others to take care of their community.' With Kotb scoring highly in focus groups, she is thought to have beaten off competition from Savannah Guthrie to take the highly coveted anchor role on Today. 'The problem with Savannah is that in focus groups, she just doesn't score as high as Hoda does,' said the insider. 'NBC has been conducting focus groups to assist the network executives in determining who should replace Ann. 'Savannah is an extremely talented journalist, and she is extremely bright, but she only recently joined Today and viewers just aren't as comfortable with her.' With the Olympics fast approaching, NBC has been under pressure to deliver a ratings winning team as they all transfer to London to broadcast for the duration of the games. 'NBC is counting on Today to deliver huge ratings during the Olympics,' said the source. 'They need the new team in place, and quickly. The original plan had been for Hoda and Kathie Lee to stay in New York City and do the fourth hour from the set. 'However, Hoda is now being asked to go cover the Olympics in London.' Ann Curry is expected to be transferred back to her original love of foreign reporting and to remain at NBC. Reports surfaced late Wednesday that Curry, who took over the anchor chair June 9, 2011, would be removed from her spot as Matt Lauer's cohost before the network's Olympic coverage begins next month. But on Thursday morning, rather than calling in sick or skipping work, she was back next to Lauer as though nothing was amiss. Like nothing happened: Ann Curry (left) sat with co-hosts Al Rocker, Matt Lauer and one of her possible replacements, Natalie Morales (right) on Thursday morning as though nothing was the matter . Support: Fans tweeted their support for Curry after she sent out this innocuous message on Thursday morning. Her name became the number one trending topic on Twitter . The New York Times reported that NBC executives were preparing for Curry not to show up on Thursday. On Wednesday it was reported she would be gone from her role before the Summer Olympics begin July 27. NBC has the rights to air the Olympics and the whole show will be anchored from London. On Wednesday, Today show producers contacted Hoda Kotb, who co-hosts the fourth hour of the program, and told her to be ready to go on the air at 7am. But Curry, who reportedly makes $2 million a year, was there, acting like normal. 'Good morning Twitterverse,' she tweeted to her 1.2 million followers on Thursday. 'Good morning. From hot to hotter. You thought yesterday was a scorcher? In many places in the East today, it’s going to get even hotter,' she said at the opening of the show. Curry has taken . the blame from many at NBC for the Today show's ratings decline. The . program lost the top spot among network morning shows this spring, a . position it had held, unbroken, since 1995. Part of the problem is a lack of chemistry with Lauer, who had great on-air chemistry with Curry's predecessors Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira. Possible replacements: Savannah Guthrie (left) and Natalie Morales (right) are both on the show now and are being considered to take over Curry's anchor chair when she leaves it . While NBC won the months of April and May for the morning slot against ABC, multiple weeks they lost to Good Morning America. One week in April broke the 16 year winning streak, and the week of May 21 Today lost to their rival by 33,000. Later in Thursday's program she appeared . alongside Lauer, Al Roker and Natalie Morales -- one of the women who . has been mentioned as her possible replacement. Her 'good morning 'tweet, sent out about 8am, received dozens of responses from her fans, who offered her their support. 'To know just how professional @AnnCurry is, she's been faultless co-hosting @todayshow this morning. Despite all the pressure. #ClassAct,' CNN interviewer Piers Morgan tweeted. The flurry made Ann Curry the top trending phrase on Twitter Thursday morning. Curry didn't respond to any of her supporters. Curry has been criticized for not being as flexible or quite as quick-witted as Lauer or Couric, who had the hosting job for 15 years before leaving in 2006. Curry took over as co-anchor from Meredith Vieira one year ago. Vieira has continued to contribute to Today since leaving. She reported from London for the Jubilee earlier this month, pictured, and will also be going to cover the Olympics. She could return as anchor . Couric was replaced by Vieira. Lauer, who recently received a reported $30 million annual contract to stay at NBC is reportedly one of the people working to push Curry out. NBC producers are beginning to panic as ABC's Good Morning America has begun trading off with the Today show for the top network morning show. Curry's more prominent role in the morning show has received the blame for this slump. Negotiations are currently underway with network executives to move Curry into a new job, likely as a foreign correspondent. But, she's apparently not leaving without a fight. 'She got her dream job, and she doesn’t want to let it go,' a source told the Times. Savannah Guthrie, who co-hosts the . show's third hour, is at the top of the list of Curry's possible . replacements. Natalie . Morales, Today's news anchor, and Meredith Vieira, who left the co-host . role last year, have been mentioned in talks for the position, news . outlets reported. Vieira has remained involved with NBC. In addition to Today co-hosting duties from London during the Queen's Jubillee, she will also be contributing from the upcoming Summer Olympics for the network. However, TMZ reported on Thursday she had been offered and refused to return. Later on Thursday morning's show Curry was on Rockefeller plaza with her cohosts for an interview with Michael Phelps mother . A decision about her departure from the show could be made before the Summer Olympics begins in later this summer. Several staff members who work on the . show have blamed Curry as the reason for the decline in ratings after . she took over the co-host job, according to the New York Times. Since then, Today and Good Morning America have been . trading wins. Some reports suggest the longtime member of the Today show may become a foreign correspondent at the network. For Curry, however, the reality of ending her time on the program has been difficult. Attorney Robert B Barnett is representing Curry in the discussions. The lawyer is known for having represented Christiane Amanpour in her talks with ABC as she left the news program This Week. Curry began . working as news anchor for the Today show in 1997, a position she held . onto until she was promoted to share the hosting role with Lauer.

"A 15-year-old girl whose burned body was discovered in Indianapolis over the weekend was likely abducted, strangled to death and then set on fire by a 'random' attacker, say police. Dominique Allen was last seen sitting on her sister's porch at 4.30am on Sunday. Her burned body was discovered at 12.30pm the same day in the yard of a home three-minutes drive away. Yesterday police discovered her purse and shoes in the back yard of an abandoned home across the street from where her body was found, and officers now believe she was taken there and killed, before the corpse was moved. A coroner has also revealed that Allen was likely strangled to death before being set alight, after an autopsy revealed there was no smoke in her lungs. The burned body of Dominique Allen, 15 (left), was discovered in Indianapolis at the weekend. Police believe she was strangled to death, then set alight. Today, her family gathered at the spot where she was found (right) One of Allen's sisters, Shenika Poindexter, issued a stern warning to whoever was responsible during a news conference Tuesday at the site where the body was found. A small makeshift wooden cross was placed next to scorch marks in the grass, and decorated with flowers and stuffed animals. She said: 'I don't know why you had to do this. Whatever you do, wherever you go, justice is going to be served, in this life or the next. 'I don't care, they will hunt you until you die. ... She did not deserve this, she did not deserve this, she was 15 years old.' Poindexter added that her sister wasn't the type to talk to strangers or get in a car with someone she didn't know. The victim had been staying with another sister, Mareeka Allen, before she vanished. Mareeka Allen said the crime was a 'careless random act,' and a detective investigating the case agreed. 'At this time, we believe it was random,' Indianapolis Metro Police Detective Marcus Kennedy said. Investigators are combing registered sex offenders for possible leads and checking for reported runaways in case there are other victims. Allen was last seen at 4.30am on Sunday  before going missing. Her burned body was found at 12.30pm the same day (pictured, Allen's family mourn her death at the scorched spot where she was discovered) Kennedy distributed a photograph of Dominique Allen taken the last night she was alive. In it, she's smiling and wearing the sandals that were discovered Tuesday. Her sisters said Allen, who attended Ben Davis Ninth Grade Center, wanted to be a model and to attend Spelman College in Atlanta. Deputy Mayor Olgen Williams, who lives a few blocks away from where the girl's body was found, comforted the family at the news conference. 'Pretty young lady, she had a future, and this evil person, or persons, destroyed her life,' Williams said in an interview afterward. Allen was last seen on Sunday sitting outside her sister's house after getting into an argument with friends and going outside to cool off. Police then believe a car was used to take her to an abandoned house a block away where she was killed. Officers do not know how many people were involved. Wayne Township school officials brought in counselors at the girl's school to help students and staff cope with Allen's death.","Dominique Allen, 15, taken from outside sister's house in Indianapolis at 4.30am on Sunday .

"With her golden tan, plumped breasts and lips and bleach blonde hair extensions it would be easy to mistake 28-year-old Carolyn for Baywatch star Pamela Anderson. And that's exactly what the Liverpudlian lookalike is hoping for, having spent £20,000 on surgery and cosmetic procedures to emulate her favourite celebrity. Carolyn, who dubs herself 'Scouse Pammie' is now a professional lookalike, posing as the Canadian actress in personal appearances and at events around Liverpool. But the petite blonde wants one more procedure to complete the transformation: Pammy's barbed wire tattoo. The best: Carolyn says she's also an improvement on the original by virtue of being from Liverpool . Model Carolyn, from Crosby in Merseyside, has been obsessed with the buxom star since childhood and has put herself at risk numerous times in her quest to become a body double for 46-year-old Pamela. As well as getting Botox, lip fillers, teeth whitening and false eyelashes applied she regularly injects herself with Melanotan II, an unregulated tanning drug, and has been using sunbeds since the tender age of 10-years-old, now spending up to 15 hours a week in her father's sunbed shop. Following a chest augmentation in 2004 she has twice suffered with exploding breasts as her DD implants burst under sunbed lamps. The model needed seven operations to repair the damage but that hasn't stopped her pursuing her idea of Pammy perfection. Carolyn, who changed her name to Pamela Anderson by Deed Poll in 2009, told The Mirror: 'I’ll admit it – I’m hooked. I’m what they call a tanorexic. But I couldn’t live without a tan – it’s a part of who I am. And I wouldn’t leave the house without one. Scouse Pammie: Carolyn uses her blonde bombshell looks to help her in her career as a Pamela impersonator . 'I used to watch ­Baywatch growing up and thought she was beautiful. I was delighted to think I looked like her. I became a bit obsessed with her in my teens and rewatched all the Baywatch shows. I just think she’s great. 'Any woman can have big breasts and blonde hair but she’s captured everyone’s attention for decades. It’s more than looks – she has charisma and intrigues people. That’s what I love and want to emulate.' Mother-of-two Pamela had a barbed wire tattoo inked on her bicep as part of her role in the 1996 Barb Wire sci-fi film. Now super fan Carolyn is planning on getting a carbon copy of the etching, telling the Daily Star: 'It's an iconic image that everyone associates with Pammy. 'I actually really like the tattoo.'

"Neil Warnock made an unexpected return as Crystal Palace boss on Wednesday and is poised to bring Wilfried Zaha with him. The 65-year-old has been confirmed as Tony Pulis’s successor on a two-year deal, pipping Steve Clarke to the post. And Warnock will launch an immediate move to bring Manchester United misfit Zaha back to Selhurst Park on a season-long loan for a £1.5million fee. Warnock, who managed Palace for three years from 2007, has four days to strengthen his squad ahead of the transfer deadline.

"A series of earthquakes and trembles that have struck in the Atlantic Ocean in the past week suggest that an underwater volcano is about to blow. The largest of these quakes reached a magnitude of 5.1 off the coast of El Hierro - the smallest island in the Canaries - and the island is said to have swelled by three inches. If the volcano was to erupt, the force could push masses of molten rock to the surface and could subsequently create a new island or islet in the Canary chain. A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit El Hierro in the Canary Islands on Friday suggesting a nearby underwater volcano could soon erupt. This could force rock to emerge from the sea, creating a new island. In 2011, the southern tip of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake and magma appeared off the coast, pictured . This Nasa image shows seismic activity off the southwest coast of El Hierro in 2011 . It would also mean all 10,000 residents on the 107 square mile stretch of land would need to be evacuated. El Hierro itself was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high. According to Involcan, the Volcanological Institute of the Canaries, over 550 earthquakes were reported and monitored between Monday and Christmas Day on Wednesday. Some 30 of these were said to have been a 3-magnitude quake or higher. The majority of these quakes, as well as the swelling on El Hierro, were centred on the region of La Restinga on the south coast of the island. The 5.1-magnitude quake was the strongest ever recorded in the region and its epicenter was said to be around nine miles deep. In October 2011, El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake as an underwater volcano started spewing matter 60ft into the air, pictured. The island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake . In November this year, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean created a new island off the coast of Japan, pictured. The mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed Ring of Fire - a hub of seismic activity situated 620 miles south of Tokyo . In October 2011, the same region of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake as an underwater volcano just off the coast started spewing matter 60ft into the air. The island has 500 volcanic cones and experienced more than 10,000 tremors in the four months leading up to the quake. Vast quantities of magma also began bubbling into the sea off the port of La Restinga resulting in its 600 residents being evacuated. Under the Canary Islands lies an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the African Plate - on which the islands sit - shifts. Most of the islands are still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller, previously undetected fault line also runs through the chain. El Hierro was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high. Volcanic activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused El Hierro to expand continually. The last time it erupted was in 1793. Some 50,000 years ago, massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a large part of the island to crack off and fall into the Atlantic Ocean, according to Irish Weather Online. That created the El Golfo valley on the island and caused an 300ft-high tsunami that probably reached the American coast. This feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on La Palma - the most tectonically active of the Canary Islands - could trigger a mega-tsunami. The theory - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line through the island would cause a major landslide under certain circumstances. That landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage all down the Atlantic Coast of the U.S., the Caribbean, Western Europe, West Africa and the east coast of South America. By December the same year, the eruption was said to be subsiding because the number of tremors and earthquakes decreased. This increased again in January 2012, but by March the authorities on El Hierro declared the eruption threat to be over. Following the swarm of quakes early last week, El Hierro’s monitoring agency raised the volcanic eruption risk to ‘yellow’. Following the rise in seismic activity in 2011, dark brown magma was spotted off the coast of El Hierro, pictured left, near the town of La Restinga. La Restinga was evacuated and shipping in the area was banned but the activity subsided by March 2012. Right, a closer image of the magma in the water . This computer-generated image shows the underground volcano off the southern-most Canary Island, El Hierro . The most recent previous ‘yellow’ alert was released in June 2012, but the volcano failed to erupt then as well. In November this year, a powerful volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean created a new island off the coast of Japan. The . mass of rock was forced from the sea following an eruption in a region dubbed Ring of Fire - a hub of seismic activity situated . 620 miles south of Tokyo. When it first emerged, the new island was . 600ft in diameter and appeared next to a small, uninhabited island in . the Pacific called Nishinoshima. Further eruptions last week, however, have caused the new island to move and join Nishinoshima. The last eruption on El Hierro was in . 1793 and lasted for a month. The last eruption in the Canary Islands as a . whole took place on the island of La Palma in 1971.

"A Catholic Church official has said angels do exist - but that they 'do not have wings or look like cherubs'. Father Renzo Lavator, an 'angelologist', said the heavenly beings, which are 'back in fashion' thanks to New Age religions, are in fact more like shards of light. 'You do not see angels so much as feel . their presence,' he said at a conference on angels in Rome. 'They are a bit like sunlight that . refracts on you through a crystal vase.' The Catholic Church's Father Renzo Lavator official has said that angels do exist but do not have wings . Speaking at a conference in a lavishly-frescoed Renaissance palace in Rome, he added: ‘I think there is a rediscovery of angels in Christianity.' The first mention of the word ‘angelos’ came from the Mycenaean . civilisation in Greece more than 3,000 years ago. The word means ‘messenger’ in ancient Greek. The . supernatural beings are depicted in many religions and mythologies, . usually with feathered wings on their backs and halos above their heads. In Christianity, angels are generally considered messengers of God. The senior clergyman was taking part in a . debate this week on angelic art by the Fondazione Archivio Storico, an .

Cancelleria. ‘Following the cultural history of angels is following the history of humanity, or at least of our civilization,’ the organisers said. ‘Angels have helped drive religious and philosophical thought and have given birth to sublime forms of poetic and artistic expression,’ they said. Mr Lavatori said the popularised . image of angels is a necessary result of their being ‘back in fashion’ but is dismissive of all the angel art around Christmas. ‘There . is space for that, but you have to understand that these are not real . representations. Angels do not have wings or look like cherubs,’ he . said. The Vatican official, an 'angelologist', said: 'You do not see angels so much as feel their presence' The widely-published Catholic clergyman is also a ‘demonologist’ and says angels are more needed than ever because increasing secularisation and materialism in society have left an ‘open door’ for the devil. ‘There is a lot more interference from diabolical forces. That is why you see queues of people outside the exorcists' offices in churches,’ he said. ‘Pope Francis talks more about the devil than about angels and I think rightly so. But it's still early, he will get round to the angels too.’","'Angelologist' Father Renzo Lavator said the beings are 'back in fashion' thanks to the popularity of New Age religions .

"The hunt for alien life has been given a boost after scientists discovered a habitable planet almost the same size as Earth. Astronomer Thomas Barclay from Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California made the discovery using data collected by the Kepler space telescope. The unnamed planet was found orbiting an unidentified star in its so-called Goldilocks zone - a region around the star that emits just enough energy, light and temperature for liquid surface water to appear. Nasa's California Ames Research Centre used data taken from the Kepler space telescope to discover a total of five planets orbiting an unnamed M1 dwarf star, stock image pictured, with one said to be around 1.1 times the size of Earth. This planet sits on the outer edge of its star's habitable zone . M dwarfs are stars that are much smaller and dimmer than Earth’s sun, and aren’t bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Also known as red dwarfs, these stars make up around 70 per cent of all the stars in the galaxy. Scientists originally discounted the theory that planets around M dwarfs could be habitable because the stars give out such little light and heat, compared to our sun. However, in 2005, astronomers began searching for habitable planets around these dim stars. The planet recently discovered by Nasa’s Ames Research Centre is what’s called a goldilocks planet, orbiting around an M1 dwarf. Goldilocks are planets that orbit inside a star’s habitable zone - a zone in which proximity to the host star is a certain distance that temperatures on the surface are suitable for water to appear. Mr Barclay made the announcement during the Search for Life Beyond the Solar System conference in Arizona. Using the Kepler images, Mr Barclay said he believes he has found a new star system consisting of five planets orbiting an M1 dwarf star. M dwarfs are stars that are much smaller and dimmer than Earth’s sun, and aren’t bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. Also known as red dwarfs, these stars make up around 70 per cent of all the stars in the galaxy and range in size. By comparison, our sun is called a G dwarf, and these type of dwarfs account for only 5 per cent of stars in the universe. The outermost planet in Barclay’s five-planet system is said to be 1.1 times the size of Earth and is called a goldilocks planet because it orbits within the M1 dwarf’s habitable zone. Although other Earth-like planets have been discovered previously, Barclay’s unnamed goldilocks planet is believed to be the closest in size to our own. Nasa's Kepler launched in 2009 with the purpose of hunting for Earth-like planets. It discovered a planetary system last April featuring Earth-size planets in a 'habitable zone.' Kepler-62f, pictured right on this illustration, is 1.4 times the size of Earth, while Kepler-62e, pictured bottom left, is estimated to be 1.6 times larger . Nasa’s Kepler mission launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of hunting for Earth-like planets. It discovered a planetary system last April that featured Earth-size planets in an 'habitable zone.’ Dubbed Kepler-62 system, it has five planets in total called 62b, 62c, 62d, 62e and 62f. Kepler-62f is about 1.4 times the size of Earth, while Kepler-62e is estimated to be 1.6 times larger. Kepler-62 and the Solar System: The diagram compares the planets of the inner solar system to Kepler-62, a five-planet system about 1,200 light years from Earth in the constellation Lyra discovered last April. Until now, these were the closest planets to Earth, in terms of size . Both planets are thought to be rocky, . or made mostly of ice, and until now were believed to be the most . likely to be Earth 'doubles'. No other details about Mr Barclay’s discovery have been announced and the official findings are due to be released later this year. Nasa's . Kepler . space telescope has detected almost 3,000 candidate . planets outside our solar system - a fifth of which are believed to be . 'super-Earths' between 1.25 and twice the size of the Earth. The Kepler space observatory, named . after the 17th century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched . on 7 March 2009 to scan a portion of the Milky Way for Earth-size . planets that could harbour life. The research team used data from . Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously . measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When . a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the . spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is . blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. The size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet's size accurately. To . learn more about the properties of the stars, scientists . examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface . of the star. They . probe the interior structure of stars just as geologists use . seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure . of Earth. The science is called asteroseismology. The sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface and these waves cause oscillations that Kepler observes as a rapid flickering of the star's brightness. Small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones. The barely discernible, high-frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure. This is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun.","The host star hasn’t been named but was identified as an M1 dwarf .

A massive 36 years of scientific data generated by Nasa's Voyager spacecraft has been transformed into a powerful piece of orchestral music. Voyager 1's current mission (illustrated) along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond . While some scientists said they remain unconvinced, NASA celebrated. 'It's a milestone and the beginning . of a new journey,' said mission chief scientist Ed Stone at NASA's Jet . Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Voyager 1 will now study exotic . particles and other phenomena in a never-before-explored part of the . universe and radio the data back to Earth, where the Voyager team awaits . the starship's discoveries. The interstellar ambassador also . carries a gold-plated disc containing multicultural greetings, songs and . photos, just in case it bumps into an intelligent species. This artist's concept shows NASA's two Voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath, the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun . It is 36 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where . nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After . making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on . Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was . extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The . current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, . is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. Voyager 1's odyssey began in 1977 . when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of . the gas giant planets of the solar system. After beaming back dazzling . postcard views of Jupiter's giant red spot and Saturn's shimmering . rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune. Meanwhile, Voyager 1 . used Saturn as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past Pluto. Voyager 1, which is about the size of . a subcompact car, carries instruments that study magnetic fields, . cosmic rays and solar wind. Last year, scientists monitoring . Voyager 1 noticed strange happenings that suggested the spacecraft had . broken through: Charged particles streaming from the sun suddenly . vanished. At the same time, there was a spike in galactic cosmic rays . bursting in from the outside. Since there was no detectable change . in the direction of the magnetic field lines, the team assumed the . far-flung craft was still in the heliosphere, or the vast bubble of . charged particles around the sun . Voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . The Voyager team patiently waited for . a change in magnetic field direction — thought to be the telltale sign . of a cosmic border crossing. But in the meantime, a chance solar . eruption caused the space around Voyager 1 to echo like a bell last . spring and provided the scientists with the data they needed, convincing . them the boundary had been crossed in August of last year. 'It took us 10 seconds to realize we . were in interstellar space,' said Don Gurnett, a Voyager scientist at . the University of Iowa who led the new research, published online in the . journal Science. The new observations are fascinating, . but 'it's premature to judge,' said Lennard Fisk, a space science . professor at the University of Michigan and former NASA associate . administrator who was not part of the team. 'Can we wait a little while . longer? Maybe this picture will clear up the farther we go.' Voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments, with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020. What bothers Fisk is the absence of a change in magnetic field direction. Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan . McDowell was more blunt: 'I'm actually not going to believe it for . another year or two until it's been solidly outside for a while.' While Voyager 1 may have left the . solar system as most people understand it, it still has thousands of . years to go before bidding adieu to the last icy bodies that make up our . neighborhood. Voyager 2 trails behind at 9 1/2 . billion miles from the sun. It may take another three years before . Voyager 2 joins its twin on the other side.

"Colombian police have seized 2,350 kilograms of cocaine hidden inside just one boat. Authorities laid out their haul - for the cameras in a bid to reinforce their determination to crack down on illicit drugs in the South American country, which was long the world's leading cocaine producer. The cocaine has a street value of $125 million - a considerable mark-up as according to figures provided by the police, a kilogram of cocaine can be purchased for $2,200 in the jungles in Colombia. Colombian police have already seized over 29 tons of drugs this year. Colombian police have seized 2.350 kilos of cocaine hidden inside a boat . Authorities laid out their haul for the cameras in a bid to reinforce their determination to crack down the on illicit drugs in the South American country, which was long the world's leading cocaine producer . In April they intercepted seven tons of cocaine headed to the Dutch port of Rotterdam in one of the biggest such busts in years. On Friday Colombia's government and the main rebel group in the country announced an agreement to jointly combat illicit drugs. Under the accord, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, agreed to divorce itself completely from the drug trade. DEA and Colombian authorities have said that some FARC fronts are involved in the production and sales of drugs to Mexican and Colombian traffickers and through Venezuelan intermediaries. In the past, the FARC had denied any involvement in trafficking, claiming it only taxes producers. Peru recently overtook Colombia in cultivation of coca, the crop used to produce cocaine. 'What we have agreed upon recognizes that in order to set the bases for a stable and lasting peace in Colombia it is necessary to find a definitive solution to the problem of illicit drugs,' said statement from the talks read at a news conference in Havana. On Friday Colombia's government and main rebel group announced an agreement to jointly combat illicit drugs . Under the accord, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, agreed to divorce itself completely from the drug trade . DEA and Colombian authorities have said that some FARC fronts are involved in the production and sales of drugs to Mexican and Colombian traffickers and through Venezuelan intermediaries . In the past, the FARC had denied any involvement in trafficking, claiming it only taxes producers. Peru recently overtook Colombia in cultivation of coca, the crop used to produce cocaine . It was the latest agreement reached during months of talks in the Cuban capital. The two sides earlier reached accords on agrarian reform and the political participation for the FARC, but none of them will take effect until all items on the agenda for negotiations are settled. The FARC is the Western Hemisphere's last remaining major leftist insurgency, having taken up arms a half century ago. The announcement comes a little more than a week before elections in Colombia, involving incumbent President Juan Manuel Santos, who launched the peace talks, and his main challenger, Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, who opposes them. Authorities laid out their haul for the cameras in a bid to reinforce their determination to crack down the on illicit drugs in the South American country, which was long the world's leading cocaine producer . Zuluaga, a protege of former President Alvaro Uribe, argues that the FARC needs to end hostilities for talks to continue and should not be permitted into national politics. Earlier in the day, the FARC and Colombia's other main rebel group, the National Liberation Army, issued an unusual joint statement declaring a halt in fighting for eight days, from May 20-28, around Colombia's May 25 presidential election. Rebels have tried to disrupt past presidential elections and often dismiss Colombia's electoral politics as a sport dominated by the country's elites, so the cease-fire appears to be a vote of confidence in the Havana-based peace talks launched in November 2012 by Santos. The FARC also declared a cease-fire during March legislative elections. Santos, who is seeking re-election, has been under attack from his main rivals for breaking with the policy of Uribe, whose relentless, U.S.-backed military pressure had seriously weakened the guerrilla forces. Men step on packages of cocaine as they are displayed to the press in Turbo, department of Antioquia, Colombia . The cocaine is lined up for display at the media conference . Conservative Party candidate Marta Lucia Ramirez said the rebel announcement 'is a cease-fire in which the FARC joins the presidential campaign' of Santos. Zuluaga, running second behind Santos in most polls, said that 'the halt to criminal actions should be indefinite and verifiable.' But the action was welcomed by pro-Santos Sen. Roy Barreras, who said it 'is a clear message Colombians that peace is close and is possible.' The rebels have declared temporary cease-fires in the past, though they have not been fully honored. The government itself has refused to grant cease-fires to the rebels during the talks. Both of Colombia's rebel groups formed in the 1960s as an outgrowth of rural movements that sought a more equitable distribution of land. The FARC is the hemisphere's largest active guerrilla army, with about 8,000 members still in arms. The National Liberation Army, which has about 2,000 fighters, is not taking part in the Havana talks, though it has expressed a desire for negotiations with the government. Meanwhile, four presumed members of the FARC died in an explosion, apparently while mishandling explosives, according to Patricia Velez, mayor of the town of Planadas, where the blast occurred. She said the dead included three adults and one minor.","Colombian police seized 2,350 kilos of cocaine hidden inside a boat .

"Britain’s North-South divide even applies to the rate of climate change, new research shows. Scientists have discovered that the climate in the South of Britain is warming much more quickly than that in the North of the country in summer. However, winter temperatures are increasing more quickly in the North. The hottest five per cent of summer days in the UK have become hotter since 1950. The greatest increases in temperatures have been in the South. Summer temperatures in the North have not risen as quickly . The researchers also discovered that some of the hottest days and coldest nights in parts of Europe have warmed more than four times the global average since 1950. The new paper by researchers at the University of Warwick and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, revealed that the hottest five per cent of days in summer have warmed fastest in a band from southern England and northern France to Denmark. In this band, the hottest five per cent of days have got hotter by more than 2°C in many places. By contrast, the average and slightly hotter than average days have warmed most in regions further south in France and Germany. In eastern Spain and central Italy there has been broad warming across all types of days, but in most places those days which are cooler than average have not warmed so much. Most regions of Europe have seen little change in the temperatures of the coolest summer days although in eastern Spain and central Italy these days have warmed along with all other types of summer days. Image estimates changes in daytime summer temperatures that have occurred over a 43 year period. Plot A shows the change in the five per cent of hottest summer days. Plot C is the change in the average temperature. Plot E . shows the change in the five per cent of coolest summer days . Average temperature days in these regions of eastern Spain and central Italy have warmed by more than 2°C in many locations. The results show little warming in summer daytime temperatures for most locations in Norway and Sweden, for all types of summer days – hot, average and cool. In Europe, the coldest five per cent of winter nights have warmed most in eastern France, western Germany and Belgium where changes of more than two or even 2.5°C are not uncommon. The coldest five per cent of winter days have not changed as much in these regions but in northern Italy and the Balkans changes of over 1.5 or 2°C are seen in the data. In Spain and much of Italy there has been little change in winter night time temperatures of all types – warm, average and cool. In Norway and Sweden many regions have seen large changes in winter night time temperatures for average and colder than average nights. Warmer than average nights in this region have warmed less. In the United Kingdom the frequency of nights which fall below zero has decreased most substantially in the north east where reductions of at least 10 per cent are seen in the observations for some locations. The researchers translated observations of weather into observations of climate change using a gridded dataset of observations stretching back to 1950. The paper points out that some locations and temperature thresholds have seen little change since 1950. The authors suggest that the results highlight the scale of the difference between global change and the local climate changes felt by individuals. Dr David Stainforth, the lead author of the paper, said: ‘Climate is fundamentally the distributions of weather. ‘As climate changes, the distributions change. But they don’t just shift, they change shape. ‘How they change shape depends on where you are. ‘In Britain, climate change will feel very different if you live in Northumbria to if you live in Oxfordshire - different again in Devon.’ He added: ‘Our results also illustrate that the international goal of limiting the increase in global average temperature to 2°C would involve far greater changes for some places and for some aspects of climate, and therefore for particular individuals, communities and industries.’ Professor Sandra Chapman of the . University of Warwick said: ‘It is common to discuss climate change in . terms of changes in global average temperatures but these can be far . from people’s perceptions of climate change. Image estimates changes in night-time winter temperatures over a 43 year period. In the UK, the largest changes can be seen in Plot E which shows the very coldest five per cent of winter days. These have warmed by more than 1.5 degrees, with these changes focused mainly in the North East . ‘The results in this paper begin to provide a picture of how local climate has been changing across Europe. It is a picture which is closer to that experienced by individuals.’ Dr Stainforth concluded: ‘Changes in local climate pose challenges for decision makers across society not just when preparing for the climate of the future but even when planning for the climate of today. ‘We need to design buildings so that they don’t overheat, decide which are the best crops to plant, and even plan for variations in large scale productivity. ‘These would all benefit from knowledge of how the climate distribution has changed at particular locations. This work begins to provide such information.’","In the South the hottest 5% of days have got up to 2°C hotter .

"Police in an area of Afghanistan where 109 British troops died and hundreds were wounded trying to secure peace are riddled with corruption, child abuse, drug taking, kidnap and murder, a devastating investigation by Panorama revealed last night. Weapons, ammunition and fuel paid for by UK taxpayers are being openly sold by Afghan officers - possibly to end-up with the Taliban - while senior police refuse to crackdown of the abuse of young boys by their officers. Some officers appear drug-addicted, others are kidnapping civilians for ransom while in the past five weeks, four boys suspected of having been used as 'sex slaves' have been shot - one in the face - while attempting to escape from police commanders believed to have abducted them from their families. Three have died. A BBC documentary has revealed fears over Afghan police officers, who are set to take over security when Coalition forces withdraw. The force is shown to be drug-addled, selling arms to the Taliban and molesting young boys. File picture . The disturbing reality of what has been achieved in the Sangin area of the troubled Helmand province and the extraordinary workings of local police were laid bare on BBC Panorama by correspondent Ben Anderson, who spent five weeks embedded with US forces in Afghanistan's most violent area. His stark findings questioned the optimistic assessment of some commanders and politicians, including defence secretary Philip Hammond, ahead of the full hand over next year to Afghan forces that 'transition is proceeding very well - it is on track'. And it raised questions too for the families of the British troops killed during anti-Taliban operations in Sangin where UK forces handed over security to the US in 2010. Royal Marines at Sangin District Centre, Afghanistan. A total of 109 British servicemen have died there and hundreds more injured . Lucy Aldridge, whose 18 year-old son William, of 2nd Battalion The Rifles died there is 2009 after being blown-up while trying to rescue colleagues, said: 'This will really make those who have lost loved ones think...it is not a surprise but very worrying. 'If nothing has been achieved and this kind of thing is going on among the police who are meant to be responsible for law and order then everyone who has lost their lives has done so for nothing. 'It begs the question that will be at the back of the minds of all those who lost someone in Sangin...did our loved ones lose their lives in vain?' The documentary casts doubt on defence chiefs claims the handover is on track . Mrs Aldridge said she was 'pleased' the failings of the police had been exposed and questioned the need for British troops to ever have become involved in Sangin. She said that at one stage during 2009 Sangin was the most dangerous place in the world and that he son's unit had been 'pretty much a sitting target' as it tried to establish a peace in which Afghan civilian police could operate. The Panorama programme Mission Accomplished? Secrets of Helmand, highlighted the work of U.S. Marine Major Bill Steuber, who is in charge of police advisory teams. Afghan police in Jalabad, 2007. Some officers are believed to be selling off arms, petrol and even scrap metal from security walls . There was despair in his voice as he said corruption among the police was rampant, comparing it to the TV show 'the Sopranos.' 'It's vast,' he said, 'everything from skimming ammunition off their supplies to skimming fuel off their shipments. 'There's false imprisonment - they'll take people during an engagement, and they'll just wrap everyone up, then they'll wait for the families to come in and pay them money to be able to release them.' The major said police often sell weapons and ammunition in the local bazaar, including rocket propelled grenades. In one instance, a patrol base was deemed unsafe to stay in because the Afghan police were selling off the security walls as scrap metal. Lucy Aldridge, the mother of 18-year-old Rifleman William Aldridge, the youngest soldier killed in Afghanistan. He died in Sangin. Every Afghan police base has one 'chai boy', a tea boy, who is often barely into his teens - some are used as servants and sex slaves, Major Steuber told Anderson. None of the commanders responsible have been arrested and referring to the frustrations of his job, the US Marine officer said : 'Try doing that day in, day out...working with child molesters, working with people who are robbing people, murdering them. 'It wears on you after a while.' He adds : 'As an adviser you are a dog with a lot of bark and not a lot of bite...if we were to shut down all of their corruption schemes you would render them ineffective.' Many of the patrol bases British and US forces fought so hard to establish and defend have been abandoned and most of the US marines remain on base with just 18 leaving to advise Afghan police and troops at 34 sites. Anderson said that because of the growing risk of deadly insider - or 'green on blue' - attacks, the Americans live completely apart from their Afghan counterparts. Whenever the Americans enter the Afghan side of the base, they have their weapons cocked, ready to fire. 'When they did go out, what the marines saw was far from encouraging,' he said, 'At one checkpoint, the Afghan police were openly smoking marijuana. Two other police officers, assigned to fill sandbags to fortify a watchtower, were high on something stronger - probably opium or heroin. 'When one of the police commanders was shot, three weeks after I left, the American medics who saved him found a bag of heroin in his pocket.' Anderson told how a police commander identified a factory making the improvised explosive devices that have killed hundreds of Coaltion troops and Afghan civilians and asked the Americans to close it down. Told that it was now his job, he reluctantly agreed to mount an operation only to disappear on unannounced leave.

The 26-year-old spent last week training with Sam Allardyce's first team squad and impressed the coaching staff enough to be invited to stay for another week.

"No compensation: Barry George was acquitted of murder . The man sensationally acquitted of . murdering Jill Dando yesterday lost his High Court bid for compensation – . on the grounds that another jury could have found him guilty. Two judges ruled Barry George, who . spent eight years in jail before being cleared of the TV presenter’s . killing at a retrial, was not eligible for up to £500,000 as a victim of . a ‘miscarriage of justice’. Lawyers for the convicted sex . offender claimed that the Justice Secretary  had unfairly and unlawfully . decided  Mr George, 52, was ‘not innocent enough to be compensated’. But in ruling that Mr George had . ‘failed the legal test’ for an award, Lord Justice Beatson and Mr . Justice Irwin said the minister who had opposed his compensation bid was . ‘entirely justified in the conclusion he reached’. They added: ‘There was indeed a case . upon which a reasonable jury, properly directed, could have convicted . the claimant of murder.’ Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando, 37, was shot outside her home in Fulham, south-west London in April 1999. The murder prompted an enormous . inquiry by Scotland Yard and resulted in unemployed loner Mr George . being convicted in July 2001. He was granted a retrial on appeal, and received a unanimous acquittal by a jury in August 2008. Mr George then made a  claim for . compensation for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment, but this was . rejected in January 2010. He went to court again to seek a . reconsideration of his case, which could have opened the way for him to . claim as much as £500,000. His barrister, Ian Glen  QC, insisted . that the original decision to refuse compensation was ‘defective and . contrary to natural justice’, arguing that for more than 30 years, those . acquitted on retrials in similar circumstances had been compensated. Shot dead on her own doorstep: BBC presenter Jill Dando was 37 when she was murdered in London in 1999 . Previously, compensation was only awarded for a miscarriage of justice if a claimant could effectively prove they were innocent. But a Supreme Court hearing in 2011 . widened this to say a person is eligible for compensation if they can . prove that no set of circumstances could possibly lead to their . conviction by a jury. The judges ruled Mr George’s case did . not pass this second test. His solicitor, Nick Baird, said: ‘We are . very disappointed with the judgment and shall be applying for permission . to leapfrog the Court of Appeal to have the matter heard before the . Supreme Court.’ Mr George’s action was one of five test cases to decide who is now entitled to payments in ‘miscarriage of justice’ cases. Decisions to refuse payouts in all . five cases were defended by current Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in a . three-day hearing last October. Only one claimant, Ian Lawless, who . spent eight years in jail for murder before being freed by the Court of . Appeal in 2009, was successful. The judges ruled the decision to refuse . compensation was flawed and must be reconsidered. Mr George – who has a record for . attempted rape and indecent assault – and the three other claimants . failed in their challenges. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We . welcome the Court’s decision in these cases, in that it confirms that . our decision not to grant compensation to the named individuals was . correct.’ Residential street: Miss Dando was shot outside her house in Gowan Avenue in Fulham in April 1999 . In 2010, the Mail revealed how former . deputy headmaster Sion Jenkins had been refused compensation for the . six years he spent in  jail accused of murdering foster daughter . Billie-Jo. He had sought up to £500,000 damages for the term he served . before he was acquitted. But although Mr Jenkins said he . fitted ‘all the criteria’ for a payout, the Ministry of Justice rejected . his request after officials assessed the case. Rules stated that . applicants for miscarriage of justice compensation had to show they were . ‘clearly innocent’ to receive money.","Barry George, 52, acquitted of 1999 murder in August 2008 .

"Jailed: Rawad Bastawi was sentenced to eight years in prison for rape and sexually assault . A man who raped and sexually assaulted a 13-year-girl after plying her with drugs and alcohol has been jailed for eight years. Rawad Bastawi was found guilty of abusing the underage teen over a number of days at an address in Whitehawk, Brighton. The 31-year-old maintained his innocence throughout the two-week trial but was found guilty by a jury and sentenced today at   Lewes Crown Court. Bastawi, who has no fixed address, was arrested in January this year and charged with rape and sexual activity with the 13-year-old girl. He was also accused of the rape of a 15-year-old girl and sexual assaults against a 16-year-old girl but was found not guilty of the crimes. Detective Constable Ed Downes, who led the investigation, said: ‘Bastawi is a despicable individual who abused the trust of the victim over a number of days by plying them with alcohol and cannabis.' He said that by pleading not guilty Bastawi had put his victim through the ordeal of having to give evidence and relive the abuse she suffered at his hands. ‘Today’s verdict and sentence brings a . successful resolution to what has been a long ordeal for the families . involved,' he added. Bastawi was sentenced at Lewes Crown & County Court in East Sussex earlier today . 'The sentence imposed sends a clear message that offences of this nature will be harshly dealt with if found guilty.’ Bastawi was ordered to sign the sex offenders register and has also been served with a Sexual Offences Prevention Order restricting his contact with teenage girls. Mr Downes said: ‘I would appeal to anyone who is a victim of sexual crime or knows of someone who they think is being abused to please contact us. ‘Your call will be dealt with in the strictest of confidentiality and we will work with our partner agencies to provide you with the right support and care.’","Rawad Bastawi, 31, jailed for eight years .

"A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her male friend in a shotgun rampage has urged a jury to find him guilty so he could be back in prison in time to watch a football match. 'Remorseless': Nathan Burris ia accused of shooting Deborah Ross, and her friend Ersie Everette III, at the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge toll plaza, in San Francisco Bay, California . Nathan Burris, 49, who is representing himself in his trial in Martinez, California, snapped . his fingers as he asked the jury to speed up so he could get back for the Monday night game. He said: 'I . did it. So what?' before adding 'No remorse, no regrets, no mercy. ... You want me to draw it out in crayon?' Burris, a truck and shuttle driver stands accused of shooting Deborah Ross, and her friend Ersie Everette III, at the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge toll plaza, in  San Francisco Bay, California, in August 2009. Giggling and smiling, Burris, who has a speech impediment, cursed the people he allegedly killed as members of the victims' family looked on, the SFgate reports. Prosecutor Harold Jewett asked Burris if his father would have been proud of him during cross examination at Contra Costa County Superior Court. But after 30 minutes, Burris refused to answer any more questions, gesturing towards the jury as he said: 'This isn't Sesame Street... They get it bro' But Burris did not get his verdict on Monday as he wanted, instead closing arguments are planned for today. After a 13-year relationship Burris' former partner Ms Ross, 51, had planned to move out of the house she shared with him and according to her family had already started packing her things. It has been claimed she had started to date Mr Everette, 58,  a Golden Gate Transit driver and aspiring church deacon from San Leandro. According to the Contra Costa Times, Burris said he first fatally shot Everette in the toll plaza car park and then ran to Ross' toll booth and gunned her down while she was on duty. Burris was arrested the day after the shooting. He tried to plead guilty during his first court appearance, saying he was ready to die. But under state law, capital murder suspects cannot plead guilty without a defence lawyer's consent. Burris has claimed that Mr Everette threatened him, leading him to an act of 'self-preservation.' On Monday Burris again said he wanted to plead guilty saying that all that mattered was that he was alive, and they were not. But after talking to an attorney who was appointed to advise him, Burris changed his mind and decided to preserve his right to appeal. He told Superior Court Judge John W. Kennedy 'Why not?' Contra Costa County Superior Court in Martinez, California, where Burris is standing trial accused of killing his girlfriend and male friend . In a second trip to the witness stand, he denied Ms Ross had been moving out and said he was ready to spend the rest of his life in prison. Grinning as he refused to answer questions he said he was just happy to be alive. Asked why he was smiling, he said he would not be 'crying about what happened three years ago.' before adding to the jury: 'It is what it is.' Speaking outside court to Sfgate.com, Ms Ross' 25-year-old niece, Elesha Nelson of Oakland, said she had to suppress an urge to slap the defendant. If the jury finds him guilty of murder, along with the special . circumstances of lying in wait and killing multiple victims, the trial . will move to a death penalty phase. Burris will face either . execution or life in prison without parole. But . if California voters support a ballot measure today to repeal the death . penalty, the final phase will not be held and the trial will end. Burris would be sentenced to life in prison without parole if the jury upheld the special circumstances.

"Killed: Shaaliver Douse, 14, was killed by police early Sunday. Officers say he pointed a gun at them . The shooting of a 14-year-old boy Sunday by a rookie police officer has shocked New York City. The police commissioner concedes that the teen may be the youngest person ever killed by the NYPD. Despite the tragic young age of Shaaliver Douse, Ray Kelly was quick to defend the white 26-year-old officer, who just graduated from the police academy last month. Kelly said the teen had fired multiple rounds and was chasing someone through the streets of the Bronx about 3am Sunday. When two officers confronted him, he refused to drop the pistol and pointed it at them, the Commissioner said at a press conference Sunday evening. The officer fired a single round from his 9mm service pistol, striking Shaaliver in the jaw and killing him. Police sources told the New York Times that they believe Shaaliver was pursuing a gang rival. Detectives believe the incident was also related to the shooting of a 15-year-old boy in May, for which Shaaliver was arrested and charged with attempted murder. The NYPD released a picture of an Astra 9mm semiautomatic pistol covered in the boy's blood - in an effort to prove that he was armed at the time he was killed. The department also produced surveillance video that purportedly shows Shaaliver in a white t-shirt running toward a man standing in . front of a bodega and opening fire. A second video . shows Shaaliver chasing the target around the corner. It was there that . the teen was confronted by police. Scroll down for video . This bloody 9mm handgun (pictured here) was involved recovered from an armed 14-year-old Bronx boy who was killed by a rookie NYPD officer . The NYPD says this video shows Shaaliver shooting at the man in the blue t-shirt and then chasing after him . Police say this teen in a white T-shirt is Shaaliver. He can be seen running after his target on the streets in the Bronx . When Kelly was asked whether the Bronx teen was the youngest person ever killed by a New York police officer, he hesitated. 'I don't recall any other at this juncture. There may have been, I just don't recall,' he said, according to the New York Post. Despite this show of evidence, his family has denied that the 14-year-old boy was involved in gangs and said the NYPD is trying to whitewash the killing. 'They're making it all up. There was no gun. It’s all a cover-up. It’s what the police do. They kill us and cover it up,' the boy's aunt Quwana Barcene told the Post. 'It’s not fair. It was my sister’s only child. You shouldn’t have to bury your child. My beautiful nephew got shot in the head. A mother of one now has to bury her only child.' NYPD top brass are standing by the officer in the shooting - but are treading carefully. 'Regardless of the circumstances, this is a crushing blow to any parent,' Kelly said. The crime scene (pictured here) was located in the Bronx where in the early hours of the morning two uniformed police officers found boy firing at a fleeing man . In the aftermath of the shooting NYPD officers carefully case the scene for evidence where two rookie cops shot an armed 14-year-old boy . Ms Barcene likened the shooting to . the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida - a case that sparked . outrage across the country. 'Him, . Trayvon Martin, it’s never going to end.' she said. 'A child. Fourteen . years old. Fourteen years old. Gone. Shot in the head. By police.' Many . in the black community remain highly skeptical of the NYPD over the . shooting death in march of 16-year-old Kimani Gray in Brooklyn. Police . said the teen also had a gun, though the shooting drew marches across . the borough in protest of the killing. Sunday . was not Shaaliver's first run-in with police. In May, he was arrested . and charged with attempted murder after he shot and wounded a . 15-year-old boy in the neighborhood. Police say they used surveillance . video from that that incident to identify Shaaliver among a group of . teens running from the scene. However, those charges were later . deferred and Shaaliver was released back onto the streets when the . 15-year-old victim couldn't testify against his shooter. Police believe that shooting was gang-related, as well. The fatal shooting occurred in the Bronx at the volatile corner of Courtlandt Avenue & 151st Street . The shooting occurred right near this Bronx convenience store where police discovered Douse firing shots at a fleeing man . Police . said the altercation Sunday started when Shaaliver, who lives in a . nearby housing project with his mother, opened fire on a man standing . outside a bodega in the crime-ridden Melrose section of the Bronx. The target fled, running down the street, with Shaaliver chasing after him. Two . officers, age 26 and 27, who had jointed the NYPD in January and . graduated from the academy last month, were in the area as part of an . Operation Impact deployment of police in the neighborhood. The . uniformed officers identified themselves as police and ordered . Shaaliver to drop his weapon when they confronted him, authorities said. Instead of dropping the weapon, police say, he raised it and pointed at the officers. One . of the officers opened fire shot him in the left side of the jaw, . police said. The teenager was pronounced dead at the scene. '(The officers) literally were half a block away from where the (first) shots were being . fired,' a police source told The New York Daily News. 'They ran . to the corner and there it was.' The man Shaaliver was firing at is still at large. Run-in with the law: Police say this picture shows Shaaliver running away after he shot a 15-year-old boy in the Bronx in May. He was later released after prosecutors cited lack of evidence . The unnamed police officers involved in the shooting were patrolling the high-crime area in the Bronx .","Shaaliver Douse, 14, was chasing down man and shooting at him when he was encountered by NYPD officers, police say .

"Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie MacDonald claimed he would rather lose Stephen Hendrie for free in the summer than lose him to ‘shambolic’ West Ham now. A deal to take the 20-year-old full back to Upton Park was all but done at the turn of the year only for representatives of the east London club to fail to put pen to paper. A furious MacDonald, who believed he had secured a deal that may have risen to £2million, told Sam Allardyce that the deal was off. ‘We’d agreed terms with Crystal Palace for Stephen to go there once the transfer window opened but unfortunately Neil Warnock lost his job so that fell away,’ said MacDonald shortly before the club’s 5-0 defeat to Partick Thistle at Firhill. Stephen Hendrie (right) has been linked with a move to a number of Premier League clubs . ‘But prior to that West Ham had expressed an interest so we then opened a dialogue with them. They made an offer which was acceptable and our representatives met with their representatives in London. ‘The fee was agreed, Stephen agreed personal terms through his agent and they were meant to come up on New Year’s Day to sign off the deal and didn’t appear. ‘They then said they would be up on the 4th of Januray but didn’t appear so I just cancelled the deal.

"9/11 conspiracy theorist and investigative journalist Michael Ruppert has reportedly committed suicide. The 63-year-old former narcotics investigator with the LAPD shot himself after his radio show, according to an announcement by author Carolyn Baker who was a guest on his final broadcast on Sunday. Mr Ruppert was famous for his litany of conspiracy theories which encompassed the CIA to drugs, international politics, the oil industry, Wall Street and 9/11. Scroll down for video . Conspiracy theorist and investigative journalist Michael Ruppert, 63, has reportedly committed suicide . On her Facebook page, Ms Baker wrote: 'This was not a ''fake'' suicide. It was very well planned by Mike who gave us few clues but elaborate instructions for how to proceed without him. 'It was my privilege to have known Mike for 14 years, to have worked with him, to have been mentored by him, and to have supported him in some of his darkest hours, including the more recent ones.... Thank you Mike for all of the truth you courageously exposed and for the legacy of truth-telling you left us. Goodbye my friend. Your memory will live in hour hearts forever.' Mr Ruppert, 63, has recently moved to the Rocky Mountains, a friend said in a Facebook announcement about his death . Dozens of fans left tributes to Mr Ruppert on his Facebook profile page. Attempts by MailOnline to confirm Mr Ruppert's suicide were unsuccessful. 42 West, the New York publicity department for his 2009 documentary Collapse hung up the phone when contacted while the Milwaukee production office could offer no information. Attempts to contact author Carolyn Baker were so far unsuccessful. Phone numbers connected to Mr Ruppert's businesses were disconnected. Max Mogren, who worked with Mr Ruppert for 15 months between 2011 and 2012, could not confirm his death today but said that a lot of his former colleagues' close friends had posted messages of condolence online. Mr Mogren told MailOnline today that Mr Ruppert was very passionate and very committed to his work. Mr Mogren said: 'He believed what he believed. All of his work was motivated by his love of humanity.' After leaving the LAPD, Mr Ruppert started a  website From The Wilderness which claimed to expose government corruption. It included his claims that he had seen drug-dealing at the CIA. Mr Ruppert gained notoriety by confronting  then-CIA Director John Deutch during a meeting in 1995 and telling him that he had seen CIA officers involved in drug-dealing. He later claimed on his website that the CIA and American government was involved in 9/11. In 2004, he published Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil. The book alleged than former VP Dick Cheney had conspired with Wall Street and other government officials over the September 11 World Trade Center attacks. In 2009, he starred in a documentary called Collapse where he spoke about his theories involving the demise of mankind following the economic and energy crises. His work was not without detractors. Many claimed that the investigator only used partial sources to qualify his work. Activist and writer Norman Solomon wrote: 'Some of the problem is in how he characterizes news reports. These . citations can be narrowly factual yet presented in a misleading way. Yes, such-and-such newspaper reported that thus-and-so claim was made by . so-and-so. The paper reported on the claim, but that doesn't mean the . claim is true.' Mr Ruppert had recently moved to the Rocky Mountains. He is survived by his partner Jesse Re.","The 63-year-old former narcotics investigator with the LAPD, shot himself after a final radio show broadcast, a friend reported .

"Vice President Joe Biden told a group of supporters on Monday that 'it's time to take back America' so that they can get an 'equal share.' Both Biden and President Barack Obama dusted off the economic populist message that propelled them to a second term and  hit the road on Labor Day traveling to the union friendly cities of Detroit, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to gin up support for a minimum wage increase. Though a government-mandated raise in workers' wages has virtually no chance of passing . Congress during the 12 days the legislature will be in session before Election Day, . it's an issue that plays well with the voters the Obama administration . is trying to turn out to vote in November's federal elections. Vice President Joe Biden, center, and labor leaders Dennis Williams, left, and James Hoffa, right, address the crowd before the start of the Labor Day Parade, at the site of old Tiger Stadium, in Detroit on Monday. Biden told attendees 'it's time to take back America' President Barack Obama and Vice President Biden used Labor Day to call for a raise in the minimum wage. Obama is pictured here speaking at Laborfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin . If Democrats are able to maintain control of the Senate and gain a . majority in the House, the earliest point the president's party would be able to bring . forward minimum wage legislation is January. Biden argued today that Americans deserve a 'fair wage' so that they can send their children to college and purchase homes. 'Just give . them a chance. No hand out. Just give them a chance,' he plead. 'Because once you . give Americans a chance, they have never, never, never, never, ever let . their country down, he said. 'Never. 'So folks, it's time to take back America, as . we say. It's time to change the tax code. It's time to make sure you . get equal share.' President Obama took up his old refrain that average Americans deserves a 'fair shot' because not everyone was 'born with a silver spoon in their mouths.' 'I believe in the American Dream because I have lived it,' Obama said. 'And I . ran for this office to restore it for everybody so no matter what you look like, and no matter where you came from, no matter how you started, you can make it in America if you try.' President Barack Obama, right, is greeted by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, left, as he arrives at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee. Walker, a Republican, survived a tough recall election in 2012 initiated by the same group of labor supporters Obama spoke to today . Obama told attendees of his speech at Laborfest that sometimes people meet him in person and 'say I look taller than I do on TV. I say yeah ...that's because the TV's small. It makes me look smaller' Obama's speech, which was chock-full of jokes, was a hit with his progressive audience . ''I'm not asking for the moon. I just want a good deal for American workers!' he yelled, after referencing Republican lawmakers' opposition to raising the minimum wage. 'You know, the average person, they're not looking for a yacht. They're not looking for their own plane. They're not looking for a mansion. They don't need to be vacationing in St. Barts,' he said, pausing in between each one for laughter and applause from his audience, which was mostly comprised of union members. 'All they're looking for is that if they work hard, they can pay the bills. That they can send their kids to school. That they can retire with some dignity. Maybe take a vacation once and awhile,' he said. 'They ain't looking for nothing fancy.' Obama noted the difficulty he's had moving his agenda this afternoon, claiming that 'every inch of it we've had to work against a lock step opposition that is opposed to everything we do. 'But it was worth it. Every gray hair is worth it,' he said pointing to his head. 'And at least, I've still got some hair,' he added, to which an audience member told him that he still looks good. 'See, I like that,' the president replied. 'Thank you.' President Barack Obama fists bumps an audience member after his Laborfest speech . Vice President Joe Biden visits with customers at the Great Lakes Coffee Roasting Company where he had a Finca Kassandra, a Mexican bean pour-over coffee, following his speech . A surprised Michigan resident reacts as Biden leaned his head against hers while making an unscheduled stop at the coffeehouse . The president used the light-hearted moment to crack a joke about how 'surprised' people are when they meet him in person and find he looks better than they expected. 'And then sometimes they say I look taller than I do on TV,' Obama added. 'I say yeah ...that's because the TV's small. It makes me look smaller,' he said to laughter before returning to the topic at hand. Obama told attendees of his Laborfest speech that 'the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people are organizing around an idea whose time has come. 'Millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come,' he said, firing up the crowd. Obama acknowledged that life isn't always fair, and 'sometimes you get a half a loaf where you wanted a whole loaf. 'Sometimes you might just get a quarter of a loaf,' he noted. But the president asked his supporters to trust him just as they did in 2008 'to bring about the change we need.' He also encouraged them to believe in their own power to make a difference. 'I’m asking you to believe in you.  Because even when our politics just ain’t right, there’s a whole lot that is right with America,' he said. 'America is not the party we belong to, but the values we share. America is hard work. America is responsibility.  America is sacrifice. America is looking out for one another,' Obama said. 'Let’s embrace some economic patriotism that says we rise or fall together as one nation, as one people.' Noting that 'cynicism is fashionable these days,' Obama counseled his fans not to give up on America. 'Cynicism didn’t put anybody on the moon. Cynicism never won a war, it never cured a disease, it never started a business, it never fed a young mind, it never built a road or a bridge,' he said. 'Cynicism is a bad choice. Hope is the better choice.'","Biden and Obama gave speeches on the minimum wage to labor groups in Detroit, Michigan, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, respectively, this afternoon .

"White children are less likely to continue their eduction at university than any other ethnic group, official figures reveal. Fewer than 29 per cent leave school with the aim of starting an undergraduate course – compared with 57 per cent among Chinese children and 41 per cent of Asian pupils. Black children – once the worst-performing ethnic group in schools – are now the third most ambitious, with an application rate of 34 per cent. Fewer than 29 per cent of white pupils leave school with the aim of starting an undergraduate course . White children have long trailed behind Chinese and Asian pupils in terms of chasing university places. But the figures from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service show they have been bypassed by other groups. They also come behind two wider categories used by Ucas – mixed race children (31 per cent), and all other ethnic groups (33 per cent). Ucas chief executive Mary Curnock Cook said: ‘Our new analysis of demand by ethnic group shows that white pupils at English schools now have the lowest application rate of any ethnic group. ‘There has been significant growth in demand from black pupils.’ Chief schools inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw last month published a major report which found under-achievement is  now most pronounced among white working-class children in suburbs, market towns and seaside resorts. White children have long trailed behind Chinese and Asian pupils in terms of chasing university places . Previously, black children from inner-city schools had presented the biggest problem. An anti-schools culture among white children has been blamed for a collapse in their academic performance. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said cultural difference might explain the different attitudes towards education. ‘New arrivals to this country are very keen to make use of the educational opportunities they didn’t necessarily have in their own countries,’ he added. ‘When it comes to British children – boys in particular – there are fixed expectations based on what their parents have achieved.  There is more of a view that university isn’t for them because they don’t come from that sort of background.’ White children still make up the majority of undergraduates because they are by far the largest ethnic group . White children still make up the majority of undergraduates because they are by far the largest ethnic group. But the Ucas figures, which relate to 18-year-olds at state schools, show applications by white boys and girls have dropped for the last three years. The largest increase has been among black pupils, whose application rate has soared by 70 per cent since 2006. Overall, around 44 per cent of school leavers apply to go to university. But there are significant differences between the sexes, with around 49 per cent of young women trying to get into higher education compared with only 37 per cent of men. And while children from the most advantaged areas are 2.7 times more likely to seek a university education than those from deprived areas, the figure has fallen from 4.3 in 2004. Successive governments have tried to widen applications and universities have been ordered to take more deprived students in return for charging higher tuition fees – triggering accusations of social engineering. London had the highest application rate, at 41 per cent, compared with 31 per cent in the North East.","Fewer than 29% leave school with aim of starting an undergraduate course .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report from Wembley . When you don’t give the fans what they want, they turn their backs on the team and walk away. This, we can safely say, was an official protest. England are perilously close to The Great Depression at international level and it will take more than a 1-0 win over Norway to drag them clear of danger. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson: Not many friendlies command a 40,000 attendance . Protest: Players line up in front of empty stands for England's international friendly against Norway . Staying away: Wembley is almost empty as players warm up ahead of their first game since Brazil . Empty seats: The attendance of 40,181 was the lowest ever for an England game at the new Wembley . Hangover? Fans' interest has diminished since England's disastrous performance at the 2014 World Cup . Lack of interest: Unless England can pick themselves up, empty seats will become commonplace . Hardcore: Dedicated England fans still turned out to cheer England on but their patience will not last forever . The biggest challenge is to win over the fans, the sceptics who stayed away from Wembley on a night when, frankly, there was nothing else to do. Good on the 40,000 who trekked to the national stadium to watch a team minus the old favourites — Stevie G and Super Frank — for the first time since that humiliating World Cup exit. Those lucky fans with £30 tickets arrived in plenty of time because the Underground trains at Baker Street were empty and the roads that are usually a pig to navigate around Wembley were clear. For a tenner you could park closer to the stadium than England’s head coach Roy Hodgson. Inside, the atmosphere was eerie and uncertain, a throwback to the empty stands at the old stadium when things got really bad under dear old Sir Bobby Robson in the late Eighties. Attendances of 20,000 to 30,000 were not uncommon at the Twin Towers back then as the FA tried to drum up support for Home Nations and Rous Cup tournaments. This was a new low, with just over 40,000 turning out to watch the team for the first time since they were booted out of Brazil before 12 teams had even played their second group game. Wayne Rooney, England’s new captain, pointed out that this would still be the second highest attendance in Europe behind world champions Germany. They lost 4-2 against Argentina in Dusseldorf, so maybe there is hope after all. Spot on: Wayne Rooney scored the only goal of the game with a second-half penalty . VIDEO Rooney looks to spearhead England revival . Dawn of a new era: Wayne Rooney started his first game after being handed the England captaincy . Too little too late? Wayne Rooney is congratulated by teammates after scoring what was the winner . The last recognisable protest by England supporters was after the penalty shootout defeat against Portugal in the 2006 World Cup quarter-final in Gelsenkirchen. A few weeks later, in Steve McClaren’s first game in charge of the national team, 45,864 were at Old Trafford to watch England play Greece. Our splendid new national stadium was still being built. Under the arch on Wednesday night, they watched the team limp over the line with a 1-0 victory over the world’s 53rd best team, thanks to Rooney’s emphatic finish from the penalty spot. To regain the trust of the nation, the team will need to gather momentum in a tour of the continent that takes us to Switzerland (on Monday), followed by Estonia, Slovenia, San Marino and Lithuania in the Euro 2016 qualifiers. It isn’t anything to get worked up about. No cigar: Daniel Sturridge came closest to breaking the first-half deadlock with a delicate chipped effort . Going to ground: Arsenal playmaker Jack Wilshere (L) could have been awarded a first-half penalty . Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson speaks to his players during a water break at Wembley . Credit to those present on Wednesday night because it would have been very easy to voice disapproval when England trooped off at half-time with the score 0-0. They were playing against a team who could barely string two passes together and yet we were reminded, as usual, just what a threat Norway were on the break. The atmosphere here was uncomfortable. Everyone wants to see an England team emboldened by the words of Hodgson but — just like the stadium — they are increasingly empty. They want to believe, we all do, that England can come again at international level and go deep into World Cups and European Championships. Next generation: Raheem Sterling (L) was part of a youthful Three Lions side selected by Roy Hodgson . Dull: Leighton Baines has an effort on goal during another lacklustre performance from England . The sensible things to do would be to engage with inner-city kids and pay for busloads from deprived areas to come and watch England at Wembley. Instead, the FA will bombard us with advertising puff ahead of the next international occasion, when San Marino arrive for a none-too-mouthwatering Euro 2016 qualifier on October 10.

"When Danny Welbeck steps out to make his Arsenal debut, he will hope to have more luck than the last two players to wear the No 23. For Nicklas Bendtner and Andrey Arshavin were last seen displaying the number on the back of their shirts for the Gunners, with any source of joy drowned out by a lack of effort and ineptitude. Welbeck inherits the number after a £16m deadline day swoop to the Emirates Stadium from Manchester United. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsenal's new signing Danny Welbeck in England training . Got your number: Danny Welbeck is the new No 23 at Arsenal after his £16m move from Manchester United . But who else? Andrey Arshavin signed for Arsenal from Zenit St Petersburg in January 2009 . Next up: Nicklas Bendtner wore the No 23 shirt last season after several loan spells away from the club . Before Arshavin arrived in England in a similar beat-the-clock deal, the shirt had actually been worn by some club legends. Sol Campbell and Ray Parlour to name a few, and early on the Russian's career (circa Jan 2009) looked to be heading down a similar path. A solo strike against Blackburn was followed by an incredible four goals at Anfield at Liverpool. Fans were sure the best player of Euro 2008 would maintain his form in the Premier League. But after a solid first full season at the club, performance levels dropped. As did the work-rate. The playmaker was later moved on to Zenit St Petersburg, on loan, and then on a free. Varied success: At first Arshavin looked like a star at the Emirates Stadium . Not so much: A talented youngster, the No 23 shirt didn't do much for Bendtner in North London . Having started his Gunners career successful as a youngster as No 26, the move to No 52 (rumoured to be his wage packet) for Bendtner was an odd one. The Danish striker claimed the number was 'personal' to him. He even refunded fans who bought a shirt with his previous digits on. No such explanation was given about his No 23, which he acquired after loan moves at Sunderland and (unsuccessfully) at Juventus. Wenger begrudgingly welcomed Bendtner back into his squad and while he looked thoroughly off the pace. Lazy, a liability at times, but he was of course not devoid of confidence. Two goals in the Premier League last season, one of those in the last minute against Cardiff, helped Arsenal finish in the top four. Of course Nicklas is gone now, and probably forgotten. It's now time for Welbeck to put smiles back on the fans' faces in that No 23 jersey.","Welbeck is new No 23 after signing from Manchester United for £16m .

"A young black bear just overcame its own bucket challenge in western Pennsylvania with the help of some daring rescuers. The Bucket Bear, as it had come to be called, had been roaming through Perry Township, Clarion County, for over a month with a black bucket-like object stuck on its head. The Patriot-News reports that animal rescue volunteer Dean Hornberger planned the mission to free the Bucket Bear with his girlfriend Samantha Eigenbrod after seeing a photo of it on Facebook. Scroll down for video . Blinded: Krissy Elder took a photo of the Bucket Bear roaming the highway and woods of western Pennsylvania and set up Save the Bucket Bear to rally support to encourage authorities to intervene . To the rescue: A group of volunteers conducted an impromptu rescue mission in the woods of Pennsylvania to free the Bucket Bear . The two rounded up a band of volunteers to assist in the rescue and set off for the woods near where the bear was photographed. Hornberger and Eigenbrod had been searching for two hours and were about to call it quits for the day, when they came across the Bucket Bear near the highway. Hornberger approached it and attempted to wrestle off the rubber container, which turned out to be an air bag that likely broke off a tractor trailer. The bear slipped out of his grasp and led the group on a 20-minute chase through the woods towards 'the biggest mud hole in the area,' as Hornberger described it. Once the group tackled the bear, Shawn Balcita pinned it down with his body while Hornberger cut the metal ring on the cushion with a hacksaw. Eigenbrod recorded video of the brave rescue on her cellphone. Brave: Shawn Balcita posted photos to Save the Bucket Bear of scratches from the bear's claws and said he also had a gash on his chest . After Balcita released it, the Bucket Bear dashed back into the woods, freed of its cumbersome bucket. According to Save the Bucket Bear, a Facebook page set up by Krissy Elder, the Pennsylvania Game Commission was contacted but told her they could not do anything while the bear was healthy and 'mobile.' Balcita and Hornberger suffered some scratches from the bear's claws, but otherwise the group emerged unharmed.","The young black bear was roaming Perry Township, Clarion County, in western Pennsylvania with a bucket-like object stuck on its head .

"He was a Republican president to no end, with some political pundits even arguing he may be the last, as support for the right-wing party - especially among Millenials - continues to wane. And now it seems that not even the daughters of George W. Bush stand behind his cause. Neither of the Texas-born twins - both 32 - have registered as Republican voters, it has emerged. According to The New York Daily News, Jenna Bush Hager is registered to New York's Independence Party, while Barbara Pierce Bush is not affiliated with any political party. She is however registered to vote in Texas, where she lives with her family.

'Free thinkers': Jenna Bush Hager (left) and Barbara Pierce Bush (right) say they prefer to avoid the labels of political parties and consider themselves Independents . The Daily News reports that Jenna's registration was actually accidental. The newspaper said the younger twin intended to register as an Independent, however mistakenly ticked the Independence Party. 'Jenna registered to vote in New York soon after her daughter was born, and like all new moms, she was functioning on very little sleep,' a spokeswoman said. 'She mistakenly registered for the Independence Party.' In an interview with People in 2010, two years after their father was succeeded by Barack Obama, the women said they chose not to embrace any party. 'I don't really label myself as Republican or Democrat,' Barbara told the magazine. 'We're both very independent thinkers,' Jenna added. In January, a survey ranking the social and political attitudes of different generations showed that each successive generation had become more politically independent, according to Mother Jones. The survey, by the Pew Research Center, showed that 50 percent of Millennials described themselves as political independents and about 29 percent said they were not affiliated with any religion. Crucially, the study showed that voting patterns had been relatively consistent for the last 40 years, however after the George Bush presidency voters left the Republican party en masse. Major changes: A survey released by the Pew Research Center in January showed a major drop in support for the Republican party, mostly among Millennials, following the Bush era . In June, first lady Michelle Obama and her predecessor, Laura Bush, joined forces to campaign about the importance of educating women and girls worldwide. 'You have to change attitudes before you can change behaviors,' Mrs. Obama said. She noted that some 60 million girls, including 30 million in sub-Saharan Africa, do not attend school. She also said that until global leaders understand that educating girls is as important as educating boys, 'then we will have a lot of work to do'. 'We do need to make sure worldwide that all women are valued,' added Mrs. Bush. The two were appearing at President Barack Obama's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit.

"Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg faced the media after Belgium Grand Prix crash . Lewis Hamilton said trust is not something he applies to motor racing after being asked about his relationship with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg going forward following the controversial incident involving the two at the Belgian Grand Prix. Hamilton's race at Spa was wrecked after the front right-wing of Rosberg's car hit his left-rear tyre, resulting in the Briton suffering a puncture. Hamilton, who later claimed the German's actions were intentional, was eventually forced to retire late on in the race, while Rosberg went on to finish second and subsequently move 29 points clear of his rival in the fight for the title. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton preview this weekend's Italian Grand Prix . Facing the media: Lewis Hamilton answered questions from the assembled press ahead of the Italian GP . When asked if there was a base of trust and understanding for the two team-mates to be able to work together from here, Hamilton said on Thursday: 'Trust is a big word and that's not really something that I would particularly apply to racing on the track. 'Nico and me, we've been racing for a long time and I think we set a good foundation a long long time ago so that's what we work from.' Hamilton also seemed keen not to dwell on the incident, saying he was looking forward to this weekend's race at Monza. Making his point: Hamilton was in an animated mood during the press conference on Thursday . He added at a press conference: 'It's not in my mind. I'm really excited about moving forwards, really energetic, had a good couple of days break last week and excited to be here, this is one of my favourite circuits. 'I hope that we can have a good weekend.' On his own future, Hamilton added: 'We are constantly talking with the team. I still have a contract for a whole year on top of this one. I see my future with Mercedes. I am really happy there.' Rosberg, meanwhile, admitted he was not proud of the incident at Spa. 'In Spa definitely I was not proud of the way it went because in general I really want to contribute to my sport, because I want it to be the most entertaining sport in the world,' he said. 'And if I am able contribute to that in many ways throughout the season then I'm very happy, and I'm sure in many ways we have.'

Mercedes took 'suitable disciplinary measures' against Rosberg following the Belgian Grand Prix, hitting the German with a six-figure fine. Hamilton confirmed on Thursday that there were no threats of punishment from the Brackley-based marque hanging over either him and Rosberg going forward - or orders not to challenge each other on the track. He told Sky Sports: 'There's none of that, we're free to race and I think that it's just very clear that they don't want what happened in the last race to happen. 'So it's just another normal weekend for me and we're just going to be pushing ourselves to move forwards.' Rosberg, who has apologised for the incident at Spa, was jeered on the podium at the end of the race but hopes to avoid a repeat from British racing fans if he finishes in the top three in Italy this weekend. He told Sky Sports: 'I hope they accept my apology with time. I fully understand they were not happy in Spa because they came a long way to see a great race and it didn't happen, so I hope that with time they can enjoy the battle we're having.'

"For all Anderson's faults, you can't knock his bravery. Before taking part in the ice bucket challenge last week, the Brazilian nominated his old boss Sir Alex Ferguson to suffer the same freezing fate. It raised a few nervous chuckles inside the Manchester United camp but it would have to be an icy day in hell before Ferguson accepts this challenge, especially from a player who has flopped so spectacularly. Ferguson had such sky-high hopes for Anderson. Back in 2007, he was going to be the new Roy Keane and the long-term replacement for Paul Scholes. Decline: Anderson tries to stem the flow of goals in Manchester United's 4-0 humiliation at MK Dons . Too little, too late: Anderson tries in vain to stop MK Dons' Will Grigg from scoring their second goal . Overpowered: The Brazilian, making a rare start for United, is outmuscled by Benik Afobe . Misery: Anderson (second right) looks disconsolate after MK Dons score their second goal . To borrow the words of Ferguson's scout brother Martin, he was set to be bigger than Wayne Rooney. He was destined to become an Old Trafford icon, it was inevitable. These promises were enough to persuade Ferguson to part with £27m. Rooney had cost just £20m, Cristiano Ronaldo £12m but Anderson Luis de Abreu Oliveira was tipped to rise above them both. Today, Anderson is still only 26 and United can't get rid of him quickly enough. There was a time when Anderson against Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas was the new Keane-Vieira and, often, the Brazilian was emphatically the victor. Now, he is being spun around in circles by League One defenders. On top: Anderson gets the better of Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas during one of the battles between the pair .

United and Anderson hit a new nadir in Tuesday night's 4-0 humbling at MK Dons and to say the player was ineffective was the understatement of the season. Over the course of the last seven years, Anderson has spiralled from one of the hottest properties in world football to an overweight laughing stock. It is one of the biggest falls from grace the English game has ever seen. The man has four Premier League winners' medals and lifted the Champions League in 2008, but nobody would deem his time at United a success. He should be in the prime of his career but looks like a man winding down in the twilight years. He is washed up, unloved and unwanted, with even a few months on loan at Fiorentina last season failing to revitalise him. Belly up: Anderson celebrates with Javier Hernandez.

'The point is to learn all this without losing technique. If they cannot do this, it's their fault. 'Anderson is a classic case. If you remember him as a young player, he was pretty much like Neymar, but after playing there he became predictable. 'But he's the only one to blame for this. It's not down to the Premier League.' Little wonder the Brazilian national team selectors turned their back on him six years ago, they could see any skill had been sacrificed and there wasn't a lot left. For someone billed as a devoted, box-to-box midfielder, it is surprising that fitness has been such an issue. In 71 starts for United, he has finished only 20 games. Benched: With Nani on the bench at Old Trafford. It has become a familiar vantage point for the Brazilian . Unwanted: David Moyes included Anderson in just eight games before sending him out on loan . Injuries to his knee, hamstring and calf have all struck over the last four seasons but, when fit, Anderson has been unwilling to put in the effort to try and impress. Ferguson gave up on him long before his retirement and David Moyes included him only eight times, usually in short cameos from the bench. Louis van Gaal has given every member of his squad a fair hearing but his inclusion at stadium:mk came only as a result of a debilitating injury crisis. Now the future is uncertain. Anderson is part of the deadwood the Dutchman wants off the wage bill, yet no one seems willing to take him. There was talk of a return to Fiorentina for another loan spell but their interest has cooled. United will listen to any offers. It is, alas, a classic case of massive potential unfulfilled. Anderson's nomination of Ferguson for the ice bucket challenge may well be the most memorable thing he does this season. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.

"The plot that turned into Australia’s biggest match-fixing scandal was hatched between Hastings, Sussex and Singapore in late 2012 and was blown apart last September when 10 people, including a group of English footballers, were arrested in Melbourne for alleged involvement in throwing games. In the days and weeks running up to the bust, police had almost outnumbered fans at some games played by a local league side, Southern Stars, watching and listening for evidence of manipulation. Emboldened by new laws, which meant they could wire-tap suspects’ phones, they had also bugged the club, including the pitch and even the goalposts. They collected evidence including calls arranging fixes, discussions about cash transfers and yells between team-mates during play along the lines: ‘Let this one in!’ Guilty: Joe Woolley (left) was fined £675 and Reiss Noel (right) was fined £1,126 after pleating guilty of fixing . Scandal: Southern Star soccer players Reiss Noel (centre) and Joe Woolley (right) leave court in Melbourne . The state police in Victoria duly laid fixing charges. Prosecutions have unfolded over the past eight months and convictions have been secured across a series of court dates, now drawing to a close. Four English footballers pleaded guilty to fixing with the Stars and three have been punished, all with fines. Joe Woolley, a 24-year-old goalkeeper, was fined £675. Ringleader: Gerry Subramaniam, involved in the global match-fixing scam involving players at the Southern Stars Football Club . Reiss Noel, a 24-year-old defender, was fined £1,126. David Obaze, a 25-year-old defender, was fined £1,700. Nick McKoy, 27, a midfielder, is scheduled to have a sentencing hearing this month. The four have all been banned for life from football by FIFA. As recently as spring of last year, they were all playing in England, in the 2012-13 Conference South season. Woolley, Noel and McKoy were at Hornchurch and Obaze at Eastbourne Borough. Gerry Subramaniam, a Singapore-based Malaysian, was given a three-year prison sentence in April for his ringleader role. The Stars’ Australian coach, Zia Younan, was given a suspended four-month sentence and a £1,700 fine this month. The court proceedings in Melbourne heard the Englishmen were nominally ‘hired’ via a firm called Match World Sports Ltd (MWSL). Documents at Companies House in London show it was registered in December 2012 to an address in Berkeley Square, Mayfair. The sole owner-director was a British man of Sri Lankan heritage called Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, from Hastings. He had previously lived for almost 10 years near Wembley. Ganeshan was tracked going in and out of Australia during the fixing at Southern Stars but left the country before he could be apprehended. It transpired he was in cahoots with a major international match-fixer, Wilson Raj Perumal. MWSL was nothing much more than a shell, a front to pretend it was hiring footballers for legitimate jobs. It was never based in Berkeley Square, never filed accounts and was struck off as a company a few weeks ago. The English players’ stories act as a cautionary tale of how easy it is to fall into bad company and illegal behaviour. Their football careers are over, although they can consider themselves fortunate they did not end up in prison. Culprit: Singaporean match-fixer, Wilson Raj Perumal, responsible for hundreds of fixed matches . Under new laws introduced last year in Victoria, those guilty of match-fixing can be handed jail terms of up to 10 years. Associates of the convicted players say they regret what happened but the players themselves have either declined to talk or not responded to requests to do so. Ganeshan’s identity has only briefly been aired in public in relation to Australia. Anyone who recognises his name probably does so because he was arrested in England last November for fixing-related activity here and in June was sent to prison for five years for that. The president of Southern Stars, Ercan Cicek, was first approached by email in 2012 with an offer of five free English players and a free coach, as part of a package where the providers would hope to bring sponsorship to the club and make money. He told local media later: ‘Our committee members are thinking, “Oh beautiful, five players for free, we’re not going to pay anything, it’s a big, big bonus”.’ Sentencing: David Obaze (left), a 25-year-old defender, was fined £1,700. Nick McKoy (right), 27, a midfielder, is scheduled to have a sentencing hearing this month . He did not suspect anything, he told police. The state of Victoria was probably about the worst place in the world last summer to embark on a fixing venture. First, new legislation had just come into force which gave police powers that included allowing ‘intrusive’ surveillance. Second, a Swiss-based monitoring company with London offices, Sportradar, had been tracking odd movements of players from England to Australia, via paid-for holidays in Bali, then irregular betting and results. The court was told that Noel said to police he once got a call on the sidelines during play from a fixer saying: ‘This result better f**king happen’ and so he walked behind Woolley’s goal to urge him to concede again. ‘Let the next one in,’ he yelled on one occasion. The players’ travel costs to Australia and accommodation was covered by the fixers, plus about £1,000 per month each for expenses, plus £1,500 per fix. It is estimated the players cost about £15,000 each for the duration, maximum. Yet sources say that the Singapore-based fixing syndicate behind the scam made about £1.2m profit from the venture, or about £200,000 per match. It seemed easy money, in an obscure league, unlikely to be noticed. Until they were caught. Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan . British citizen of Sri Lankan heritage who was jailed in June for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in England in November 2013. Former long-term resident of north London, near Wembley, and latterly Hastings, he was also involved in fixing syndicate working in Australia last year. Chann Sankaran .

"A disgraced dean at St John's University in New York has committed suicide after she went on trial for embezzling $1million and forcing students to work as her servants, it was claimed on Tuesday. Dr Cecilia Chang, 59, who was in charge of the university's Asian studies program, was found dead in her Jamaica Estates home in Queens one day after she testified at her own trial and denied taking money from the university. Dr Chang, who was nicknamed 'the Dean of Mean,' was also reportedly a suspect in the 1990 murder of her first husband, who was shot three times in the back by an unknown assassin. Accused: Dr Cecilia Chang, who was found dead in her home on Tuesday, allegedly embezzled $1million from St John's University, where she worked . According to the New York Post, law enforcement sources discovered her body at her home about 7.30am on Tuesday. he had been on house arrest since she was first charged with the crimes. A member of Chang's legal team knocked on her door Tuesday morning, the Post reports, to pick her up for court, got no answer and smelled gas. Authorities were called, broke into the home and discovered her body. A source told the New York Daily News she hanged herself from a folding ladder leading to the attic after she had also slashed her own wrists. On Monday, she had taken the stand at her trial and said she was innocent of allegations that she forced her students to wash her underwear by hand and cook her meals.'Shakespearean tragedy.' The judge presiding over the case had her responses stricken dozens of times as she refused to answer with simple yeses or nos, instead giving lengthy answers. The judge presiding over the trial, federal Judge Sterling Johnson Jr., called her death a 'Shakespearean tragedy.' on Tuesday after he was told of her suicide. 'Dean of Mean': Dr Chang earned a reputation for treating her students like indentured servants -- making them cook for her and do her laundry . Despite a mountain of evidence that . university money had been transferred to foreign bank accounts, Dr Chang . repeatedly pleaded ignorance in court Monday. When asked why she told police that . she didn't have money in foreign bank accounts -- even though records . show she had $200,000 stashed in Hong Kong -- she claimed that she had . forgotten about that account because she had been drinking before the . police interview. She said she also forgot about $40,000 she had in another account. Dr Chang said her students cooked meals for at St John's Asia Studies Center -- but only because the students prepared food for everyone who stayed there. She said students had washed her laundry -- but only rarely. Former students of the program had testified that they felt like indentured servants because they were afraid they would lose their scholarships if they refused to do work for her. The New York Daily News also reports that detectives investigated Ms Chang in the murder of Ruey Fung Tsai. From his death bed, Mr Tsai reportedly wrote 'My wife did this!' when questioned by detectives. He was shot four times in the back while leaving his business in Brooklyn, New York, in 1990. He died says later and no one has every been charged in his death.","Found dead hanging from attic ladder Tuesday morning in her Queens home .

"A police officer has been placed on administrative leave after writing on Facebook that the Ferguson, Missouri cop who shot dead an unarmed black teenager last month 'did society a favor'. Jason Lentz, a 17-year veteran of the Elgin Police Department in Illinois, is under investigation after colleagues discovered he had written multiple racially-charged Facebook posts. Details of his posts have now been released to the Courier-News following a Freedom of Information request. His suspension - the fourth in his career - comes after Ferguson cop Darren Wilson gunned down 18-year-old Michael Brown on August 9, sparking clashes between police officers and protesters. In one online post on his personal Facebook page on August 17, Lentz posted a photo of Missouri Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson - who is black - with a black man and making an 'OK' hand sign. Suspended: Elgin cop Jason Lentz, left, has been suspended after colleagues came across messages he'd posted on Facebook - including saying cop Darren Wilson 'did society a favor' for killing Michael Brown, right . 'He is also in the Chicago Tribune hugging protesters. Just awesome… appears to be the enemy within,' Lentz wrote. The post about Brown was made on August 15 above a video he shared entitled: 'Police Released surveillance footage allegedly showing Michael Brown stealing cigars befor[e].' He wrote: 'Hmmm … Innocent victim my ass. Did society a favor.' The Courier-News reported that after the post was seen by supervisors, Lentz was told to remove it - but he did not and simply shortened the message to read: 'Hmmm...' In total, 11 Facebook posts made over the past year were included in his file. In one post, he called this highway patrol captain - who is pictured making an 'OK' sign - 'the enemy within' Controversial: In a post from last November, he also agreed that if school children have Martin Luther King Day off from school, they should also be allowed to miss Veterans Day . Another included a photo of a letter a parent had written to a school, explaining that their child would not attend school on Veterans Day until students attend school on Martin Luther King Day. Lentz wrote: 'Hell Yeah!!! I think next year I'll keep the kids home.' He was placed on leave after another officer brought the posts to command staff's attention. Officials have said that the posts could violate the Police Department's social media guidelines. The officer has previously served suspensions in 2001, 2012 and June, the Courier News reported. Among these, in 2012, he was summoned to court to appear as a witness in a case about the rape of a 74-year-old woman in 2010. But he failed to turn up, telling a supervisor and assistant states attorney that he was not able to attend because he was flying out for vacation. Gunned down: Unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, left, was shot dead by Ferguson, Missouri Police Officer Darren Wilson, right, last month, sparking protests . Earlier this year, he was also accused of sending an email on the city system that included profanity. The investigation is expected to take a few weeks. Depending on the conclusion, he could return to work or face termination. Other police officers have found themselves in hot water for their comments following the Ferguson incident. Glendale Officer Matthew Pappert lost his job  after he commented on his Facebook saying the protesters should be 'put down like rabid dogs'. In another comment, he said: 'Where is a Muslim with a backpack when you need them?' Pappert later apologized, saying he was 'deeply remorseful' for the comments.","Jason Lentz, a 17-year veteran of the Elgin PD in Illinois, posted 11 racially-charged or offensive messages on Facebook this year .

"Having made a series of outrageous claims about various royals over the years, aristocratic author Lady Colin Campbell is not afraid of controversy. The eccentric writer provoked a storm of criticism when she asserted that Princess Diana had had an affair with King Juan Carlos of Spain. Then last month she surpassed herself with claims that the Queen Mother was the daughter of her family’s French cook. Mother and baby: The Queen Mother, then the Duchess of York, holds the cheerful child who would grow up to become Queen Elizabeth II. A controversial new biography purports to tell the 'untold story' of her life . Yesterday, she somehow managed to . trump that – by declaring that the Queen and Princess Margaret were . conceived by artificial insemination. Lady Campbell said it was ‘well known . in royal circles’ that the Queen Mother ‘didn’t do sex’ and ‘left that . side of things’ to King George VI’s alleged mistress. Unsurprisingly, the claims in her book . ‘The Untold Life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother’ – to be published . this month – were immediately derided. 'Gossip masquerading as history': Lady Colin Campbell (right) made the claims at the launch of her new biography of the Queen Mother in London. Experts on the Royal Family dismissed them as 'lies' and 'fiction' One respected royal author said the . book was ‘best read as a work of fiction’. Hugo Vickers also attacked . Lady Campbell for announcing its publication on the tenth anniversary of . the Queen Mother’s death. In the book, she writes that the Queen . Mother did not enjoy sex with King George VI – whose nickname was . Bertie – and so agreed to be artificially inseminated with his sperm by a . trusted doctor. Lady Campbell, 62, who is divorced . from Lord Colin Campbell but continues to use her title, added: ‘They . needed to produce an heir. If Elizabeth would not allow Bertie to . impregnate her naturally, they had to find the means of impregnating her . unnaturally... Under fire: The latest allegations about the Queen and her mother follow Lady Colin's claim that the Queen Mother was born to a French surrogate mother who worked as a royal cook . ‘There was only one course of action. Artificial insemination had the merit of accommodating both Bertie and . Elizabeth’s needs, insofar as the conception of a legitimate heir to the . throne was concerned.’ She claims the Queen Mother went to a . doctor who inseminated her with Bertie’s sperm and she then became . pregnant with the couple’s first child. The girl was born in April 1926 . and went on to become Queen Elizabeth II. Her sister, Princess Margaret, . was born in August 1930. 'Grandiose claims': The biographer alleges King George IV and the Queen Mother resorted to artificial insemination to conceive the Queen, pictured as a baby in 1926 . At a press conference yesterday, the . Jamaican-born socialite said: ‘The Duke of Windsor (King George’s . brother) had been told by his brother that Elizabeth preferred not to . partake of certain aspects of marital life, which he accepted, but they . needed children. ‘The two girls were their mother and . father’s progeny but were conceived by artificial insemination. In . aristocratic and royal circles, it was known that Elizabeth did not do . sex.’ But Mr Vickers said she had no evidence to support her claims. He said: ‘It’s all based on gossip and . hearsay. This book is best read as a work of fiction and it shouldn’t . be taken seriously.’ Lady Campbell claims the sources for . her information are ‘legion’. She said they included the Duke of Windsor . and Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, but historians including Mr Vickers . cast doubt on this, questioning whether she had in fact ever met the . Duke of Windsor and describing Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, as an . unreliable source. In the book, Lady Campbell also . describes the Queen Mother as a ‘tough old biddy’, adding: ‘I think the . blue rinse brigade will be absolutely horrified that I’ve actually had . the temerity to say the Queen Mother wasn’t a goddess.’ She said she . realised her book, which she described as ‘uncomfortable’ for the Royal . Family, would shock some, but pointed to the fact she’d been proved . right in the past. Lady Campbell was the first writer to identify Princess Diana’s battle with bulimia and her affair with James Hewitt. Speaking about the disputed claim that . the Queen Mother was the daughter of the family cook, she said the Duke . of Windsor had told her he had seen various documents supporting the . claim. From left: Queen Mary, King George VI, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) holding Princess Anne, Duke of Edinburgh (Prince Philip) and Queen Elizabeth ('Queen Mum') holding Prince Charles . She said they showed that the cook, an . ‘attractive Frenchwoman’ named Marguerite Rodiere, gave birth to the . future Queen Elizabeth because her own mother Cecilia, who already had . eight children, was unable to have any more. Lady Campbell also claims the Queen . Mother engineered her brother-in-law’s abdication from the throne. Edward VIII, Bertie’s brother, stepped down in 1936 because of his . desire to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. She said: ‘The Duke of Windsor said it . was an absolute lie that he didn’t want to sit on the throne...Did . Elizabeth and her cronies assist in shoving him off the throne? Her . cronies certainly did, the only debate is whether she did.’ She also suggests the Queen Mother had . an affair with Leon Blum, the  former French prime minister. But she . said she did not personally believe this to be the case.","Lady Colin Campbell's book dismissed as 'rumour masquerading as history'

"The amount of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere could be significantly reduced thanks to a membrane created in Japan. The polymer skin filters gases, such as carbon dioxide, out of the atmosphere while allowing oxygen to pass through it. Researchers believe their polymer membrane, known as PIM-1, will play a vital role in tackling global warming in the future. Researchers in Kyoto University have engineered a membrane (pictured left) called PIM-1, which is ‘embedded with a network of channels and cavities less than two nanometres in diameter that can trap gases of interest once they enter.’ It is hoped the findings may one day lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions and purer skies . The material, which has tiny holes invisible to the human eye, is highly porous so it captures harmful chemicals as they pass. It is hoped the findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, may one day lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions and purer skies. The gases, originating from industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels, blanket the Earth. The membrane, which has tiny holes invisible to the human eye, is highly porous so it captures harmful chemicals as they pass. Greenhouse gases, originating from industrial processes and the burning of fossil fuels, blanket the Earth. The most abundant among them is carbon dioxide, which made up 84 per cent of the United States’ greenhouse gases in 2012, and can remain in the Earth’s atmosphere for thousands of years. Countries around the world are searching for ways to reduce their carbon dioxide footprint. But the chemical is essentially a waste product with little immediate commercial value and large treatment costs. So new low-cost technologies are said to be needed to give industry the incentive to capture it.

But the chemical is essentially a waste product with little immediate commercial value, and large treatment costs. So, new low-cost technologies are said to be needed to give industry the incentive to capture it. Dr Qilei Song, from the University of Cambridge, who also worked on the design, said PIM-1 is ‘embedded with a network of channels and cavities less than two nanometres in diameter that can trap gases of interest once they enter.’ But, he explained, these intrinsic properties made it rather flimsy and poor at sorting out the bad particles, from the good. The most abundant of the greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, which made up 84 per cent of the United States’ greenhouse gases in 2012, and can remain in the Earth’s atmosphere (pictured in red) for thousands of years. The membrane is significant because it only captures greenhouse gases, and not oxygen . To overcome PIM-1’s weaknesses, the researchers heated the membrane with oxygen at temperatures ranging from 120 to 450°, a process referred to as thermal oxidation. Dr Song continued: ‘Oxygen, under high temperatures, chemically reacts with PIM-1 to reinforce the strength of channels while controlling the size of so-called gate openings leading into the cavities, which allows for higher selectivity.’ This made it twice as good at catching carbon dioxide while allowing air to pass through it 100 times faster compared with commercially available polymers. The balloon can also be used for other applications such as capturing carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, enriching the oxygen content in air for efficient combustion engines, hydrogen gas production and processes to generate plastic. Added project leader Professor Easan Sivaniah, of Kyoto University, Japan: ‘Basically, we developed a method for making a polymer that can truly contribute to a sustainable environment. 'And because it is affordable and long lasting, our polymer could potentially cut the cost of capturing carbon dioxide by as much as 1,000 times.’","The PIM-1 membrane was created by researchers from Kyoto University .

United and Van Gaal succumbed to a humiliating hammering at the hands of the Dons at Stadium MK thanks to braces from Will Grigg and Benik Afobe, on loan from Arsenal. Despite some impressive first half displays from United's youngsters, in the second period they appeared to crumble as Dons continued to grow stronger as the game progressed. Here, Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on how United's youngsters fared. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: We created chances but we made errors . Hammer blow: Will Grigg celebrates scoring the first goal in MK Dons' 4-0 victory over Manchester United . Head in hands: Ryan Giggs (second left) cannot watch as he sits next to Louis van Gaal (second right) Saidy Janko . Age: 18 . Position: Right-back/right-wing . Profile: The Swiss U19 international signed for United on deadline day last summer having impressed the United coaching staff in the FIFA Blue Stars tournament. He is big, athletic and strong and he loves to attack. His presence on the field has quickly elevated him into Van Gaal's thinking and he has a chance of being on the fringes of the Dutchman's first-team squad this season. How did he play? Janko made his debut at right wing-back against MK Dons. He was very strong and physical throughout and has shown he will not be bullied. However, he did give away two fouls in dangerous positions. The 18-year-old also got forward reasonably well but wasted a good chance to cross the ball just before half-time when Adnan Januazj played him clear down the right-wing. Replaced at half-time, he was slightly unfortunate to be sacrificed so early. Strong: Saidy Janko looked extremely powerful and strong before being replaced at half-time by Louis van Gaal . Marnick Vermijl . Age: 22 . Position: Right-back . Profile: The Belgian had not started for United in two years before the MK Dons match and he began the game in the unusual position as one of a back three. He made his debut in September 2012 in a League Cup tie with Newcastle United before being loaned to Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, where he gained valuable experience as their first-choice right-back. Vermijl is extremely versatile and can play anywhere across the back four, meaning Van Gaal could utilise his versatility this season in his 3-5-2 formation. The 22-year-old loves to get forward and will not be shy at attacking if he was to be used in a wider position. Unconvincing: Marnick Vermijl is challenged by Benik Afobe in his first United appearance for two years . How did he play? Two years after his last appearance and Vermijl was not wholly convincing at left centre-back. He was caught out with the ball in behind a couple of times and did not seem comfortable in a back three. Vermijl did make a couple of important defensive clearances in the first half, but unable to get across to cover Grigg for Dons' second goal. Totally misjudged the bounce of the ball for Afobe's second and allowed the Arsenal loanee in behind to score. Michael Keane . Age: 21 . Position: Centre-back . Profile: Keane made his Premier League debut off the bench against Sunderland last weekend and slotted in fairly well into the back three at the Stadium of Light. He is the brother of Will Keane, the striker, and has been on loan to Leicester City, Derby County and Blackburn Rovers in his career so far. The 21-year-old was extremely highly regarded at Blackburn and featured prominently for them in the Championship. He has scored three goals in 12 appearances for the England U21s and has been touted as a future full international. How did he play? Keane made his second appearance in a row as he started at right centre-back. To use an old and awful cliche, it was a game of two halves for Keane. He looked the most composed of the centre-halves in the opening 45 minutes, distributing the ball well and calming situations down. But then in the second half he just seemed to wilt under Dons' pressure. Nowhere to be seen for Grigg's second goal - in a position he should have been covering - and regularly troubled as United tried to push as many bodies forward as possible. Competitive: Michael Keane looked composed at centre-back and willing to challenge both in the air and ground . Reece James . Age: 20 . Position: Left-back . Profile: The career of Reece James has been an interesting one. The left-back was released by Preston North-End as an 18-year-old two years ago but he was handed a lifeline by United's reserve-team manager Warren Joyce. He made more appearances for United's second-string last season than any other player. After being invited by Van Gaal to appear on the pre-season tour of the USA, James scored twice against LA Galaxy and impressed against Roma - bombing forward on every possible occasion. He looks an exciting talent and, in a 3-5-2 formation, he could flourish at left wing-back. How did he play? Started at left wing-back. Always willing to get forward at every opportunity and offer himself as another striker. Sometimes a bit sloppy on the ball. Ran back towards his defence a couple of times, inviting pressure. Booked in the 50th minute for a very bad challenge where he dived in, seemingly from frustration. Gave the ball away lazily to Afobe for the third goal and that sort of blotted an otherwise half-decent copybook for the night. Just as he showed on United's pre-season tour to the US, James is willing to bomb forward at every opportunity and from an attacking point of view he looks a perfect fit at wing-back. Unfortunately defensively he can have lapses of concentration and he put his side needlessly under pressure a couple of times. He was booked in the 50th minute for a very bad challenge as well. Attacking: Reece James tried to get forward at every possible opportunity for Manchester United on Tuesday . Possession: James was willing to attack but also compete for the ball from his left wing-back position . Andreas Pereira . Age: 18 . Position: Attacking-midfielder . Profile: As opposed to the other five youngsters who tend to be defensively-minded, Pereira is an attacking option for Van Gaal. He can operate anywhere in midfield but is more adept in an attacking capacity. The Belgian-born Brazilian can operate as a No 8 or as a No 10 and he loves to take a set piece, regularly scoring for the younger-age groups. The 18-year-old was signed from PSV Eindhoven youth and is extremely highly thought of at United. With the arrival of Angel di Maria he may struggle for opportunities, but he certainly gives his manager an option to take into consideration. How did he play? Came on after 46 minutes for Janko. Looks very nice on the ball. Took a free-kick from the left-hand side of the box which just dipped over the bar, highlighting his confidence. Lovely flowing running and set up Welbeck for an effort just before the hour mark. Flair: Attacking midfielder Andreas Pereira showed signs of creativity despite joining a sinking ship on the pitch . Sinking ship: Pereira entered the fray with United already behind and could not turn around his side's fortunes . Patrick McNair . Age: 19 . Position: Centre-back/midfielder . Profile: McNair arrived at United in 2011 as a midfielder but quickly adapted to being able to competently play at centre-back as well. The Northern Irishman himself does not believe he will know his own best position for a couple of years due to his own versatility. He is highly rated and is not afraid to put his foot in - he is not immune to a booking - and would give Van Gaal some much-needed bite in midfield, something United seriously lack right now. How did he play? Made the bench but did not get on to the pitch. Yet to get his chance: Northern Irish youngster Patrick McNair (right) was on the bench but did not get on .","Braces from Will Grigg and Benik Afobe help MK Dons to famous victory .

"Seven teenage boys were still on the run today after they 'overwhelmed' their minders at a juvenile detention center in Nashville, Tennessee on Monday. The teens, aged between 14 and 19 co-ordinated their escape attempt by storming out of four dormitories before climbing under a chain-link fence. Police captured 23 of the 30 escapees  within 24 hours of Monday's escape. Scroll down for video . One of 30 escaped teenagers, second from left, is brought back to the detention center by family members . Several of the escapees were returned to detention by their families following Monday night's break-out . The teenagers aged between 14 and 19 co-ordinated their escape attempt and overwhelmed staff . Seven of these eight youngsters are still at large following Monday night's mass escape attempt . Officers discovered some of the boys walking down the road, while others were turned in by family members. LaWanda Knowles, whose nephew was one of the escapees said: 'He broke loose, he was gone, but he's back now. I just want to know that he's here safely and he's OK - I don't want the police jumping on him, nobody beating on him or nothing.' Ms Knowles said police arrived at her nephew's home, which is eight miles from the facility at 5am. He arrived at the house two hours later, where he briefly saw his parents and family. 'He wanted to see his mom, and nieces and nephews and his sisters, so he came home. But when we found out that he ran, I jumped in my truck and put him in there and brought him back.' The escape happened at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center at 11pm on Monday. The youngsters left their rooms and met in a common area. According to Rob Johnson, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman, there were just 16 unarmed  adults on duty at the time of the escape attempt. He said: 'Staffing was lighter during the overnight hours, so presumably they had planned for that.' It is understood the youngsters were able to kick out the windows from the dormitory before finding an area where there was a weak spot in the metal fence surrounding the facility. A crew checks for weak spots in the fence surrounding the facility following Monday night's escape bid . Officials at the facility immediately alerted the Tennessee Highway Patrol who joined the manhunt. None of the youths who had escaped were convicted killers. No staff members were hurt during the escape although the teens who fled could face additional criminal charges. At the time of the escape, there were 78 teens at the facility, most of whom had been convicted of at least three felonies. However, there are no warders, guard towers or barbed wire at the facility. It is more like a high school with additional security rather than an adult prison. Each of the youngsters is held in a single bedroom which is locked on the outside, but the door can be opened at any time by the inmate. In May, a staff member was injured following another escape attempt when six students attempted to flee. The facility offers education and vocational training instead of a harsh prison regime. The Department of Child Services Internal Affairs has launched an investigation into the matter. The teens, all of whom have been convicted of at least three felonies, made their escape during a shift change . All of the teens at the centre have been convicted of felony charges including burglary, violent crime and drugs . No criminal activity had been reported in the area following the escape, CBS reported. Johnson said the detention center was calm and back under control on Tuesday morning. In May this year, WSMV reported that guards who were supposed to be monitoring the troubled offenders were sleeping on the job. The station released photographs of workers in a booth who were taking naps instead of watching the TV monitors of the youths in their dormitories. Mr Johnson told MailOnline today that staff changes had been made and the center had a new superintendent following the incident. He was unable to immediately recall any similar escape incidents at the detention center. WSMV reported that along with an escape attempt a decade ago, staff were assaulted 17 times last year with two employees taken to hospital. The station also reported that at least 50 assaults have taken place where one juvenile assaulted another.

"Former Chelsea midfielder Claude Makélélé is to leave his position as PSG's assistant manager in order to become the new head coach at Ligue 1 side Bastia. Makélélé, who played for Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSG during his illustrious career could be presented as the new Bastia boss before the end of the week according to French daily paper L'Equipe. PSG offered Makélélé a two year extension to his current deal but he turned it down in order to take up a full-time role in the hot seat. He could be joined by former France team-mate Willy Sagnol in becoming a Ligue 1 boss with the former Bayern Munich defender close to being appointed as the new manager of Bordeaux .

"Two riders have been disqualified from the Vuelta a Espana after an astonishing altercation in which they traded blows from their bikes during an uphill climb. Russian Ivan Rovny and Italian Gianluca Brambilla had been involved in an early breakaway during the pivotal 160.5km stage 16 from San Martin del Rey Aurelio to La Farrapona. And simmering tensions reached a head as the leading group approached the climb towards San Lorenzo, about 40km from the finish, when Tinkoff Saxo rider Rovny appeared to try and put his arm around Brambilla.

"She is officially the fastest woman in the world on two wheels - and smashed the record using a machine she built herself. Eva Håkansson and her home-built electric motorcycle 'KillaJoule' this week smashed several records at Bonneville. With a top speed of 241.901 mph (389.219 km/h) and a two-way average of 240.726 mph (387.328 km/h), she beat the previous electric motorcycle speed record by 25 mph - becoming the world's fastest female on a motorcycle in the process.

In addition to being a new electric motorcycle record, the speed is also an overall new record for any kind of sidecar motorcycle, including internal combustion-powered sidecar motorcycles. 'This is a truly historic event,' Eva Håkansson said. 'It is the first time in over a century that an electric vehicle beats internal combustion for a vehicle type. The 33 year old is a PhD student in mechanical engineering at the NSF Center for High Voltage/Temperature Materials and Structures at University of Denver. She said KillaJoule is a 'very expensive hobby project' with her husband Bill Dube, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA. Although the design is a team work involving family and friends, Eva has manufactured about 80 % of the vehicle herself in their two-car garage. It has taken 5 years to build the KillaJoule on a shoe-string budget. The pair said they define themselves as 'backyard racers with high-level engineering skills'.

'Since then, internal combustion has dominated everything.' The record runs at the Bonneville Motorcycle Speed Trials on August 28 2014 give Eva and KillaJoule the titles. The pair say they owe much of their success to 'doing the math' to calculate exactly what will work best, instead of relying on luck, intuition or anecdotal information to find the optimal solution.

"Michael Sam's dream at becomming the first openly gay player in NFL has been put on hold after being dropped by the the St. Louis Rams during roster cuts on Saturday. The 7th-round draft pick has been outspoken and confident as his progress was watched as closely as any rookieVito Cammisano in the league. He has been cheered by athletes and celebrities. In the end, the defensive end couldn't make a team stocked with pass-rushers. The news was first reported by ESPN. Scroll down for video . Cut: The St. Louis Rams released defensive end Michael Sam on Saturday, smashing his hopes of becoming the first openly gay player in NFL history . Sam still has a chance to get picked up by another team or to make the Rams' practice squad. On Saturday, he attended Missouri's opener in Columbia, a 1 1/2-hour drive west on I-70 from Rams Park. He was introduced to the crowd at the cut down deadline in the end zone alongside defensive E.J. Gaines, a sixth-round pick who made the team. Sam blew a kiss and waved to the crowd, then walked back to the sideline. He posed for a few pictures then started looking at his phone and headed for the locker room. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft. Sam came out following his final season at Missouri. Rams coach Jeff Fisher was proud to have made the landmark pick, but he made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall. He kissed his boyfriend as a national television audience looked on, and arrived brimming with confidence and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out. The cameras followed, but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates. Historic: Sam, who came out in the months leading up to his drafting, celebrated with his boyfriend Vito Cammisanoon live television when he got the girl of his initial selection in May. However ESPN received complaints about airing a kiss between the pair . The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news of his drafting in May . Veteran defensive end Chris Long noted rosters are always made up of players from different backgrounds. One by one, players said Sam was now part of their family. Coach Jeff Fisher called the draft pick a ""second historic moment"" for a franchise that signed running back Kenny Washington in 1946 as the league's first black player in the modern era, but he was most interested in describing Sam as a way to upgrade the Rams' defense. So was general manager Les Snead, who referred to Sam after the draft as a 'designated pass rusher'. Sam recognized the challenge, so he shed weight to be faster for special teams duty, reporting at 257 pounds. After the Rams' first preseason game, a 26-24 loss to New Orleans, Fisher said Sam played 'pretty well' but also made his share of mistakes. Sam, who was credited with one tackle and one quarterback hit in the game, emerged with confidence. 'You know, I can play in this league,' Sam said. 'I can play in this league.' Sam told his teammates at Missouri that he was gay before his senior year, and judging by the results it was no distraction at all. Dreams on hold: Sam still has a chance of being picked up by another team, despite being cut by the Rams. The Rams may still choose him for practice squad . The Tigers made a seven-win improvement and tied the school record with 12 wins. Sam had 11 1/2 sacks and the lightly-regarded Tigers won the SEC Eastern Division, a huge step forward after going 5-7 during the first season in their new conference. More than 100 coaches and players kept the revelation to themselves. Sam came out in February. 'If you look at our season, it didn't hurt us at all,' recalled cornerback E.J. Gaines, a fellow rookie and former Missouri teammate. 'If anything, it brought us closer.' Sam was lightly regarded out of Hitchcock, Texas, a town of about 7,000 along the Gulf Coast about 40 miles southeast of Houston. His first two years at Missouri, Sam backed up Aldon Smith and Jacquies Smith, both of whom are in the NFL. The Rams drafted Sam even though they didn't need help at defensive end, where they have a pair of first-round picks as starters. The Rams were so well-stocked with picks, taking 11 players overall, they had leeway to take a shot. Fisher said Sam's value as a player 'was off the charts'. Michael Sam, the first openly gay athlete drafted into the NFL, was cut by the St. Louis Rams as the team trimmed its roster ahead of the start of the 2014 season . 'I'm determined to be great,' Sam said at his introductory news conference, packed with reporters. 'I understand that right now you guys want to make a big deal of it.' From the start, teammates seemed to like having Sam around. His energy was infectious and, if there were problems, they stayed behind closed doors. Publicly, Sam was just another late-round pick trying to make the Rams, which, like other NFL teams, held sensitivity training early in camp. The Oprah Winfrey Network put off a planned documentary on Sam, saying it would allow him to focus on his dream of making the team. At one point, Sam's Rams jersey was the No. 2 seller among rookies at NFLShop.com, trailing only Cleveland's Johnny Manziel, and Sam was among just 10 draftees selected by the NFL to be featured on commemorative coins. Sam headed to the ESPY Awards to pick up the Arthur Ashe Courage award. He got a hug from Hall of Famer Jim Brown on his way to the stage and fought back tears throughout his speech. 'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself,' he told the audience.","Michael Sam, 24, was the first openly gay athlete drafted into the NFL .

"A man who had an affair with a 20-year-old woman when he was only 14-years-old learns he is a father eight years later and that he owes $15,000 in life support despite being a victim of statutory rape. Nick Olivas, now 24, didn't know that statutory rape existed when he was a teenager and therefore he didn't press charges against the 20-year-old. The Arizona Republic reports that Arizona State law says that sex with a child under the age of 15 is not consensual under any circumstance making Olivas a rape victim. Victim: Even though Nick Olivas is a statutory rape victim because he had sex with a 20-year-old when he was 14-years-old he still owes money in child support . However, because Olivas did not press charges and the woman was not found guilty of sexual assault, Olivas is found viable for child support. Two years ago, the state served Olivas with paperwork saying that he owed money to his six-year-old daughter. 'It was a shock,' he said. 'I was living my life and enjoying being young. To find out you have a 6-year-old? It's unexplainable. It freaked me out.' At first, Olivas tried to ignore the legal documents and didn't take the paternity test required of him. The State eventually found him and was able to take money from his bank account. He owes about $15,000 in medical bills and child support from when the baby was born in addition to 10 per cent interest. Forced to pay: Nick Olivas, who is now 24, is forced to pay child support because he never pressed charges when he was a teenager . Olivas has said that he wants to be involved in his daughter’s life but that doesn't want to be financially responsible. Anything I do as an adult, I should be responsible for. But as a teenager? I don’t think so… I was living my life and enjoying being young. To find out you have a 6-year-old? It’s unexplainable. It freaked me out. The director of the national Center for Men told the Arizona Republic that Nick Olivas is suffering because he is a man. 'The idea that a woman would have to send money to a man who raped her is absolutely off-the-charts ridiculous… It wouldn’t be tolerated, and it shouldn’t be tolerated. We’re not going to hold him responsible for the sex act, so to then turn around and say we’re going to hold him responsible for the child that resulted from that act is off-the-charts ridiculous… It makes no sense,' he said. Olivas wants to fight his case in court but unfortunately, he cannot pay for a lawyer.","Nick Olivas owes $15,000 in child support to his 6-year-old daughter .

"Argentina was accused last night of whipping up more tension over the Falkland Islands by naming its forthcoming football season after the General Belgrano. The country’s domestic league, which kicks off on Friday, will be known as the Crucero General Belgrano First Division. The sinking of the cruiser by a Royal Navy submarine with the loss of 323 Argentine lives was a defining moment of the Falklands War. Sunk: Argentina's domestic football league will be named after the doomed cruiser General Belgrano which was torpedoed by HMS Conqueror in 1982 with the loss of 323 Argentine lives . With the 30th anniversary of the conflict imminent and the two countries engaged in a new war of words over the islands’ future, some observers felt there could hardly have been a more emotive choice of titles for its sporting showpiece. In a further twist, the league’s winners will receive a trophy named in honour of an Argentine who murdered five Falklanders. It will be called the Gaucho Rivero – . after Antonio ‘El Gaucho’ Rivero, a Falklands resident who killed a . group of British settlers in 1833. Back in action: The Argentine league resumes on Friday . Guy Opperman, a Tory MP who has called for Britain and Argentina to have better relations, said the latest actions were inflammatory. ‘This really is a retrograde step,’ he added. ‘There are 40million Argentinians and 3,000 Falkland islanders. 'Clearly they should try to get on without Argentina trying to inflame matters on a regular basis.’ Tony Davies of the Falklands Veterans Foundation said: ‘This is just another pathetic attempt to keep up the agitation on the islanders and disrupt life. Thank God we in this country would never dream of dishonouring our fallen comrades in such a way.’ Horacio Oulton, who survived the torpedo attack on the Belgrano, said he applauded the move. ‘It will ensure that Argentina’s desire to take the islands back will never fade,’ he said. ‘It will only ignite the fire inside everyone to see justice done, and the blue and white flag fly over the Malvinas again.’ The Belgrano was torpedoed by the Royal Navy submarine Conqueror on May 2, 1982. Although it was claimed that the ship was heading away from the islands, recently released documents suggest it was heading for them.","1982 sinking was a defining moment of the Falklands War .

"A substance derived from sugar has been found to 'kill' good cholesterol, turning it 'bad', scientists have discovered. Researchers from the University of Warwick found methylglyoxal (MG), which is formed from glucose in the body, damages 'good' High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which removes excess levels of 'bad' cholesterol from the body. LDL cholesterol is considered the ‘bad’ cholesterol because it contributes to plaque: a thick, hard deposit that can clog arteries. If an artery is narrowed by plaque and a clot forms, it can become blocked and the person can suffer a heart attack or stroke. Researchers say that drugs and food supplements could be developed to control the damage to 'good' HDL cholesterol by Methyglyoxal (MG),  formed from glucose in the body, which leads to an increased risk of heart disease . HDL cholesterol is considered ‘good’ cholesterol because it helps remove LDL cholesterol from the arteries. Experts believe HDL acts as a scavenger, carrying LDL cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it is broken down and passed from the body. Supported by funding from the British Heart Foundation (BHF), the researchers discovered that MG destabilises ‘good’ HDL cholesterol and causes it to lose the properties which protect against heart disease. Low levels of HDL are closely linked to heart disease, with increased levels of MG being common in the elderly and those with diabetes or kidney problems. HDL damaged by MG is rapidly cleared from the blood, reducing the blood’s HDL content, or remains in plasma having lost its beneficial function. Lead researcher Dr Naila Rabbani, of  Warwick Medical School, said that MG damage to HDL causes a significant increase in the risk of heart disease. High levels of MG, which is formed from glucose in the body occurs in diseases including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and obesity . She said: ‘MG damage to HDL is a new and likely important cause of low and dysfunctional HDL, and could count for up to a 10 per cent risk of heart disease.' There are currently no drugs that can reverse low levels of HDL, but research revealing how exactly MG damages HDL helps scientists to come up with strategies for reducing MG levels, Dr Rabbani said. She added: ‘By understanding how MG damages HDL we can now focus on developing drugs that reduce the concentration of MG in the blood, but it not only be drugs that can help.’ Another strategy could be to develop food supplements that decrease MG by increasing the amount of a protein called glyoxalase 1, or Glo 1, which converts MG to harmless substances, she said. She concluded: ‘This means that in future we have both new drugs and new foods that can help prevent and correct low HDL, all through the control of MG.’ MG is formed from glucose in the body, and is 40, 0000 times more reactive than glucose. It damages HDL at a functionally important site, causing the particle to become unstable. MG levels are normally kept low in the body to maintain good health but they slowly increase with ageing. This is because Glo1, which converts MG to harmless substances and protects us, slowly becomes worn out and is not replaced quickly. Supplies of Glo1 depleting in the body lead to abnormally high levels of MG. This is called ‘dicarbonyl stress’ and occurs in diseases including diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease and obesity. The study was published in the journal Nutrition and Diabetes.","Methyglyoxal (MG) is formed from glucose  in the body, but is 40,000 times more reactive than glucose .

"Hong Kong police pepper-sprayed pro-democracy activists today as they tried to storm a venue where a top Government official tried to explain Beijing's decision not to grant the former British colony full democracy. Scuffles had broken out at the entrance to the Asia World Expo convention centre where Li Fei, deputy secretary general of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, told delegates that China will not tolerate a local leader who is disloyal to the mainland. Pro-democracy activists inside the building heckled Li, shouting slogans and interrupting his speech explaining Beijing's decision to rule out a fully democratic election for the city's next leader in 2017. 'Anyone who does not love the country, love Hong Kong or is confrontational towards the central government shall not be the chief executive,' he said. Scroll down for video . Rage: Guards dragged a number of pro-democracy activists from the building as they heckled him, shouting slogans and interrupting his speech explaining Beijing's decision to rule out a fully democratic election for the city's next leader in 2017 . For suffrage: Hundreds people gathered overnight outside the Hong Kong central government building to protest the decision not to allow universal suffrage . Occupy: Activists from a movement called Occupy Central have threatened to blockade Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing grants full democracy, setting the stage for disruptive protests in coming weeks . Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland - a policy called 'one country, two systems'. The activists want universal suffrage, but Communist Party rulers in Beijing say any candidate for the territory's chief executive has to be approved by a nominating panel - likely to be stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists. Activists from a movement called Occupy Central have threatened to blockade Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing grants full democracy, setting the stage for disruptive protests in coming weeks. 'Occupy Central is an illegal activity. If we give in, it will trigger more illegal activities,' Li said. 'Lost faith': Dressed in black and wearing yellow ribbons, members of the democratic camp were escorted out of the auditorium after they shouted and held up signs reading 'shameful' and saying Beijing had lost credibility . Anger: Pro-establishment people in the crowd clapped as the democrats were led out . About 100 activists had gathered for Li's speech, some waving British colonial flags and banners with an 'X' over the Chinese characters for 'communism' amid a heavy police presence . Dressed in black and wearing yellow ribbons, members of the democratic camp were escorted out of the auditorium after they shouted and held up signs reading 'shameful' and saying Beijing had lost credibility. Pro-establishment people in the crowd clapped as the democrats were led out. Alex Chow, the head of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, was escorted out jeering and heckling. Student activists said they would begin boycotting classes in mid-September and that students at 11 schools had confirmed their participation. The NPC Standing Committee endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership vote. All candidates must first obtain majority backing from the nominating committee . 'We want democracy': Li said that if Hong Kong lawmakers failed to approve Beijing's decision, as is needed by law, the city's next leader will be chosen by a small election committee . Unfair: China's decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and prompted the Occupy Central camp to renew its vow to bring the financial hub to a halt . Tension: Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities . About 100 activists had gathered for Li's speech, some waving British colonial flags and banners with an 'X' over the Chinese characters for 'communism' amid a heavy police presence. The issue of democracy has been a constant source of friction between Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and the mainland since the former British colony was handed back to Communist Party rulers in 1997. Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last colonial governor who oversaw the transition, was widely hailed as the chief architect of sweeping improvements to the region's equality laws. In securing the handover, China agreed to govern Hong Kong under the principle of 'one country, two systems', where the city would enjoy 'a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs' for 50 years. It included its own legal system, freedom of assembly and freedom of speech - liberties not enjoyed on the mainland. But the government reneged on the agreement once Britain had left, implementing an unelected council with few democratic functions. Hong Kong's leader, the chief executive, is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee, largely loyal to Beijing. For years activists have agitated for the right to both nominate and vote for Hong Kong's leader, a campaign buoyed by a recent surge in discontent over rising inequality and perceived interference by Beijing. But their hopes were dashed on Sunday when the standing committee of the National People's Congress announced citizens will only be able to vote from a list of two or three candidates who have obtained the backing of a nominating panel - likely to be stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists. The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot and prompted the Occupy Central camp to renew its vow to bring the financial hub to a halt. A group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby waving China's flag. The NPC Standing Committee on Sunday endorsed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in Hong Kong's 2017 leadership vote.

Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities. The Mainland Affairs Council in self-ruled Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, expressed 'regret' at the NPC's decision while activist groups posted messages of support for the democracy movement online. 'This decision by the NPC to limit the type and number of candidates for Hong Kong's election is a major setback for the progress of Hong Kong's democracy, and we express regret at this decision,' the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said in a statement. 'This decision represents a smothering of the Hong Kong people's demand for truly representative government and casts a shadow over the progress of Hong Kong's democratization.' Following the publication by Beijing of a white paper outlining China's authority over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on voting in the 'special administrative region', and hundreds of thousands marched to the city's business district and staged a sit-in. Li's briefing was organised by the Hong Kong government and China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The vice chairman of the Standing Committee's Legislative Affairs Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Feng Wei, were also due to speak in a series of briefings throughout the day. Student activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong chief executive's office in the afternoon. Charles Rivkin, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, said in Singapore the United States backed 'free and fair elections and transparency'. 'We believe, in the case of Hong Kong, in one country and two systems,' he said. Britain made no mention of democracy for Hong Kong until the dying days of about 150 years of colonial rule.","Activists stormed hall where China's NPC deputy secretary general spoke .

"A male porn star has taken the blame for the current syphilis outbreak that has closed down the adult film industry in Los Angeles. After Mr Marcus contracted the bacterial infection on set, he altered his syphilis-positive test so he could continue performing. The 18-year veteran actor’s admission came after the industry’s self-imposed 10 day moratorium which has seen more than 1,000 performers in the Los Angeles area get tested and administered preventative antibiotics. Jailed: Porn star Mr Marcus has been sentenced to 30 days in jail after continuing to work after contracting the bacterial infection . At least nine porn stars have revealed they have contracted syphilis. According to XBiz Mr Marcus said: ‘I tried to cover it up…because I said it was like the scarlet letter. It’s the word. Syphilis, whoa. ‘Mr Marcus, syphilis? Mr Marcus, the one I worked with? The one that everybody works with? The one that’s been in this industry forever?’ Returned to work: His doctor said Mr Marcus would not be contagious 10 days after a pencillin shot so he returned to work at porn shoots after 11 days . A doctor told Mr Marcus that he would not be contagious 10 days after taking a shot of penicillin on July 13. With that diagnosis he returned to . work 11 days later, on July 24, still with syphilis. Instead of . presenting a paper or digital copy of the test results he showed the . producer a copy on his phone so the details about the infection were not . visible. While filming . another porn film, Mr Marcus said he folded the test to hide the . syphilis diagnosis and photocopied it but a producer noticed the results . were missing and questioned him about it. He said: ‘I have to live with this, no one else does. ‘I’m very sorry. I did not think that this would come out like this.’ The . porn star posted on Twitter yesterday: ‘You can be disappointed, but . don't throw stones. Some of you are living in glass houses.’ The actor said that three women he performed with after his diagnosis have all tested negative for syphilis. The bacterial infection has a 90-day . incubation period meaning a porn actor could potentially be carrying the disease . without it showing up on tests. Cover up: The porn star tried to hide his diagnosis because it was 'like a scarlet letter', leaving out the positive test results when showing producers a photocopy of his blood test. Yesterday he tweeted after his admission . Porn star Aletta Ocean, 24, said on Tuesday that she contracted syphilis while shooting movies in Budapest, Hungary. Her revelation led to speculation that the outbreak of the disease came from Hungary. Speculation it came from Hungary: Porn star Aletta Ocean said on Tuesday that she contracted syphilis in Hungary leading to speculation that the outbreak came from there . According to porn industry blog LukeIsBack.com she tweeted: 'F****** siphilis problem… In Budapest many people got it..Me too…’ Sex workers are supposed to undergo regular blood tests to ensure they are free of sexually transmitted disease. It was reported that one of the labs frequented by porn stars does not test for syphilis. Syphilis is a treatable bacterial infection that can be spread by both bodily fluids and contact with infected skin. Its causes skin lesions and rashes. If left untreated, it can permanently alter and damage internal organs and brain function. The number of syphilis cases in . California has jumped 18 per cent according to a recent report from the . California Department of Public Health. The results showed a much higher rate . of men had contracted the infection and that African Americans were . affected more than any other racial demographic.

"American photojournalist Anthony Karen is a man used to the margins of American culture. He has chronicled far-right extremists, the New Black Panthers and even members of the widely-reviled Westboro Baptist Church. Now he has created an astonishing visual record of the Ku Klux Klan, a white-supremacist organisation known for its white robes with conical hoods. He gained the trust of KKK members and was able to capture them in candid, unguarded situations that give a unique insight into the world they inhabit. The New York-based photographer said that despite their horrific beliefs they came across as normal people in their day-to-day lives. He recalled meeting one Klansman shortly after he started the project that worked as an engineer on a nuclear submarine.

It is not unlike becoming a naturalised citizen of the United States, according to the late Imperial Wizard Dale Fox . Members of the group, originally formed by Confederate veterans in the aftermath of the American Civil war, have committed numerous racially-motivated murders and assaults over the past century. They advocate the seperation of the races, claiming interbreeding between ethnicities goes against God's will (religion is a key part of their beliefs). In the 1920s they reaches the peak of their power, with as many as six million members. Today they are estimated to number between 5-8,000. One of the group's most famous crimes was the murder of three American civil rights' workers, James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, who were shot in June 1964 by members of the Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Neshoba County's Sheriff Office and the Philadelphia Police Department located in Philadelphia, Mississippi. The three had been attempting to register African Americans to vote. The FBI called its investigation 'Mississippi Burning' - which was later used as the title for a 1988 film loosely based on the case.

'If a person was finding him/her self wanting to join the Klan after viewing my images, one would logically come the conclusion that this is something they supported long before these images came along,' he said. 'I prefer to document the Klan at home as opposed to the typical imagery that most anyone can get during a public demonstration. Yes, I’m trying to show the viewers the way certain people who’ve adopted such beliefs live - they may drink soda, cook and put family photos on the wall just like the rest of us.

He said: 'They prefer “cross lighting” as it “dispels darkness, [and] brings truth and freedom to the world”. It bears witness to the light of Christ, according to their beliefs.

"Anti-apartheid icon Desmond Tutu was burgled while he was paying tribute to Nelson Mandela at yesterday's memorial service. The thieves apparently targeted his home in the suburbs of Cape Town in the knowledge that he was more than 800 miles away at the ceremony in Johannesburg. It is the second time in four months that the former Archbishop of Cape Town has been the victim of burglars. Scroll down for video . Victim: Desmond Tutu's home was broken in to while he was speaking at Nelson Mandela's memorial . Burgled: The home in a Cape Town suburb was ransacked for the second time in four months . 'I can confirm that there was a burglary last night,' his aide Roger Friedman said today. 'We are not able to tell exactly what was stolen, the archbishop and his wife were not at home. The house was not pillaged.' Police said in a statement that the crime took place at some point between 7pm and 9pm on Tuesday. 'At this stage we cannot give further details, as the investigation into the matter is still ongoing,' a spokesman said. 'No arrests have been made as yet.' Ceremony: The bishop with Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the UN, at Mandela's memorial . Intimate: Mr Tutu kisses Mandela's widow Graca Machel during the memorial service . Officers refused to confirm whether . or not anything had been taken from the home of Mr Tutu, who won the . Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. In the previous break-in, on August 7, thieves broke in to the house while the bishop and his wife Leah were sleeping, and took a number of small possessions. Burglaries are fairly common in South Africa, where they are known as 'home invasions', due to the country's extreme inequality and relatively weak government. Mr Tutu, 82, gave the closing prayers at yesterday's ceremony to the former president in Johannesburg's FNB Stadium. He urged South Africans to follow Mandela's example, saying: 'I want to show the world we can come out here and celebrate the life of an icon.' Allies: Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela were closely associated in the fight against apartheid . The memorial also featured a well-received speech by U.S. President Barack Obama, and tributes from other world leaders who heralded Mandela as one of the greatest figures of the 20th century. However, the news that Mr Tutu was burgled at the same time is just the latest in a string of minor embarrassments connected to yesterday's service. Mr Obama and Prime Minister David Cameron came under fire for taking a 'selfie' photograph with Denmark's Helle Thorning-Schmidt, while South African president Jacob Zuma was repeatedly booed at the ceremony, held in a stadium where a third of the seats were left empty thanks to foul weather. And today it was claimed that a sign language interpreter who stood next to the podium throughout the service was in fact a fraud, waving his hands around without making any sense for deaf people.","Thieves broke in to the former Archbishop's home in Cape Town yesterday .

"The husband of the woman named as Fifa president Sepp Blatter's new love today said he had no idea the pair had been romantically linked in press reports. Unfounded rumours have been circulating after mother-of-two Linda Barras, 49, was pictured arriving with Blatter, 77, at an awards ceremony last week. When asked about his wife's relationship with Blatter, Christian Barras said he was unaware of the incredible stories circulating in the Swiss press. Mr Barras, who owns an estate agency in Switzerland, said: 'I know nothing about this. I’m still married to Linda. Linked: Unfounded rumours have been circulating in the Swiss press of a relationship between married Linda Barras and Fifa boss Sepp Blatter after they were pictured (above) arriving at the Ballon d'Or awards last week . 'I know that she went to the ceremony. She is a friend of the niece of Sepp Blatter.' The brunette, dressed all in black, was seen laughing and joking with Blatter at the Fifa Ballon d’Or gala last Monday night in Zurich, Switzerland. On her other side was Brazilian footballing legend Pele. Linda and her husband, who married in 1998 and have two daughters, have known Blatter for several years. In 2008 the Fifa boss attended La Nuit Des Neiges, a Swiss charity gala event of which Linda was president up until last summer. The gala evening takes place every February and is in aid of a local and international charity. 'We're still married': Mrs Barras's husband, Christian, said he had no idea the pair were romantically linked . It was founded by Linda’s brother-in-law Francois Barras and it was at one of the events that Linda met Christian. She was later asked to become president. Swiss tabloid newspaper Blick has run a number of articles claiming Linda is Blatter’s new love. The first article read: 'Blatter's New Love is 28 years younger.' It continued: 'For almost six years Sepp Blatter has been single. Now the FIFA boss is again in a happy relationship.' According to the publication, Blatter was also spotted at Zurich airport 'sometime ago' waiting for Mrs Barras. It read: 'Sometime ago at Zurich airport he (Blatter) sat expectantly in the hall, his driver stayed with the car. 'A photographer discovered the FIFA boss and asked if he was waiting for a well-known football player. 'Blatter then smiled mysteriously - and only replied that he was waiting on someone from the heart. 'A little later an attractive, dark-haired woman took her place in Blatter's sedan - Linda Barras.' Red carpet treatment: Mrs Barras with Blatter and ex International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge . When questioned about his aunt’s . relationship with Blatter, the grown-up son of Francois said: 'To the . last of my knowledge I think they (Christian and Linda) are still . together. 'I think it’s just . a big misunderstanding what happened and a big mistake on Linda’s part . in some ways. Yes, they are still together. 'I don’t think she is Sepp Blatter’s new girlfriend at all. She is a friend of Sepp’s. Sepp is a friend of the family.' Blatter, . dubbed The Most Powerful Man in Football, has been married three times . and has one daughter, Corinne, who is mum to his granddaughter, Serena. He was born in Visp, Switzerland, and has been president of Fifa since 1998. One of Blatter’s ex-wives, Graziella Blatter-Bianca, said she was 'delighted' he had apparently found a new love. She said: 'I am very happy for him. 'We . are still in good contact. I don’t know Linda but I am delighted if he . has found a new love. Who knows, maybe there is life after Fifa. And . it’s good for him if he has someone at his side.' Graziella, who is a life coach, married Blatter in 2002. They separated after less than a year. She said being married to such a powerful man was not always easy. She said: 'Of course, you need a lot of understanding and patience. He travels a lot and has to tackle a huge workload. I admire that and think he does a very good job. His work is his calling.' Fifa refused to comment about the latest allegations surrounding the controversial boss. A spokeswoman said: 'The president says it's a private matter. It's a personal thing. 'The person accompanying him (to the Ballon d’Or) was a guest of honour. It was his personal guest.' Linda and Blatter were pictured at The Fifa Ballon d’Or, an annual football award given to the player considered to have performed the best in the previous year.

"An opportunist thief didn't hesitate to steal a £1,000 wad of notes which were accidentally dropped by an unlucky customer at a Poundland checkout. CCTV footage has been released which shows the moment Gary Bickerdike inadvertently drops an envelope stuffed with £1,000 from his pocket as he pays for goods at the Crawley branch of the value store.

"Fears of a global nuclear war breaking out were today stoked after Israel suggested Iran has been developing missiles with an extraordinary range of 6,200 miles - enough to reach the U.S. An international political storm is now in full force as the U.S. desperately tries to talk Israel out of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities amidst fears a strike could now come within just two months. Israel's deputy prime minister Moshe Ya'alon said the missiles were being tested at a site near Tehran that was destroyed three months ago and they were ‘aimed at America, not at us’. Support: Worshippers shout slogans during Friday prayers at Tehran University on Friday as Iran said it won't yield to international pressure to abandon its nuclear course . Mr Ya'alon said Iran is creating ‘a . nightmare for the free world’. Iran, which is accused of preparing to . build a nuclear bomb, says it will retaliate over Western-backed oil . sanctions and any attack threat. The U.S. doesn’t believe Iran is . producing such a long-range missile, but Defense Secretary Leon Panetta . is still reportedly fearful of a growing chance Israel would attack Iran . as early as April. ‘Threatening Iran and attacking Iran . will harm America,’ Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned . in a defiant speech on Friday. ‘Sanctions will not have any impact on . ‘our determination to continue our nuclear course’ and it will impose . any threats ‘at the right time’, he added. ‘I have no fear of saying that we will . back and help any nation or group that wants to confront and fight . against the Zionist regime (Israel).’ Defiant: Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneiei, left, warned any U.S. strike against Iran would backfire. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, was seen in a prayer with Mr Khamenei on Friday . America is leaning heavily on Israel, . even though it has largely concluded that outside argument will have . little effect on Israeli decision-making. Warning: Israel's deputy prime minister Moshe Ya'alon suggested Iran is developing missiles with an extraordinary range of 6,200 miles - enough to reach the U.S. 'In light of the realisation of the divine promise by almighty God, the Zionists and the Great Satan (America) will soon be defeated,' Mr Khamenei added, reported World Net Daily. The stand-off poses a major political . challenge for President Obama, who has been regularly mocked by most of . the GOP presidential candidates for failing to take a tougher stance . against Iran. Israel fears that Iran is fast . approaching a point at which a limited military strike no longer would . be enough to head off an Iranian bomb. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defense minister Ehud Barak have been increasingly vocal in expressing concern that Israel might be running out of time. 'The world has no doubt that Iran’s nuclear program is steadily nearing readiness and is about to enter an immunity zone,' Mr Barak said, reported Bloomberg. 'If the sanctions don’t achieve their goal of halting Iran’s nuclear weapons program, there will arise the need of weighing an operation.' Mr Ya'alon told a security conference Iran was successfully building . long-distance ballistic missiles. He said: 'Such a non-conventional regime should not have such non-conventional capabilities.' He . told the annual Herzliya national security conference in Israel that an . Iranian military compound that mysteriously exploded on November 12 . last year was developing long-range missiles. Secretary Panetta believes Israel . could strike before Iran enters a 'zone of immunity' to start building a . nuclear bomb, reported the Washington Post. Fears: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, left, is thought to believe that Israel is preparing a strike for the next few months, while President Barack Obama, right, maintains the U.S. is reserving the right to attack Iran .

The Israelis fear the Iranians will . soon have ‘enough enriched uranium in deep underground facilities to . make a weapon’, the newspaper reported. 'Threatening Iran and attacking Iran will harm America' Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader . Mr Khamenei said any U.S. strike . against Iran would backfire and the ‘painful and crippling’ Western . sanctions would only increase its resilience. ‘Americans say all options are on the . table - even the option of military strike,’ he said. ‘Any military strike . is ten times more harmful for America. Mr Khamenei said strike threats show . the U.S. can only use ‘force and bloodshed to achieve its goals’ and . cannot speak against ‘Iran's logic'. ‘Such sanctions will benefit us,’ he . said. ‘We would not achieve military progress if sanctions were not . imposed on Iran's military sector.’ Mr Khamenei described Israel as a 'cancerous tumour that should be cut and will be cut’ and talked about Iran assisting foreign militant groups.

'Israel has indicated they are considering this, and we have indicated our concerns' Leon Panetta, U.S. Defense Secretary . Iran has said repeatedly it could . close the vital Strait of Hormuz Gulf oil export route if sanctions . succeed in preventing it exporting crude. Israel estimates it could make four . atomic bombs by further enriching uranium already stockpiled, and its . first bomb within a year of starting. China stepped up its opposition to a . Western push for tighter sanctions, warning tensions over the nuclear . programme are hurting energy markets. It comes a day after German Chancellor . Angela Merkel urged Beijing to use its influence to persuade Iran to . give up its nuclear programme.

"Anger: Residents of a Cornish village have branded Prince Charles a 'bully' after he sent them letters invoking an ancient rite to land beneath their homes . Prince Charles has been branded a 'bully' by residents of Cornish village after he wrote to them invoking an ancient right - to mine under their homes. The Prince of Wales's Duchy of Cornwall estate sent letters to residents of Stoke Climsland to inform them that he owns the land beneath their properties. The Duchy wants the property owners to alter . their deeds to reflect his right to the metals and . elements buried beneath their floors. The letter has sparked fears that the claim could indicate plans for fracking or mining in the area, but the estate has denied it has such an intent. Homeowners in the area, which has a population of just 1,600, say that their deeds make no mention of the Prince's estate owning the land, but the Duchy says that a 19th century Act of Parliament granted it the mines. Residents have until December 3 to contest the claim - an action that could land homeowners with legal bills running into thousands of pounds. Former policeman Clive Donner, 60, said: 'When we purchased the property I examined the deeds. 'Nowhere does it mention that Prince Charles has the mining and mineral rights in or under our homes. 'I . also have deeds from as far back as 1847 for our property and again it . does not mention anywhere anything about rights of the Duchy. 'They say they are not planning any mining but just following the law. Claim: The village of Stoke Climsland, pictured, which is home to just 1,600 residents . Row: Homeowners say that their deeds make no mention of the Prince's estate owning the land, but the Duchy says that a 19th century Act of Parliament granted it the mines . 'If . this was the case why not just let the whole mining minerals . application dissolve into history, or at the very least state that the . Duchy has no intention now or in the future to conduct any mining in or . under any homeowners' property. He added: 'The . document states that if we do not reply it will take this as meaning we . agree to the Duchy's request and application. 'Employing a legal adviser . would cost a small fortune and is out of reach for all of us. 'This . is nothing more than bully tactics and has been done to ensure that the . Duchy gets what it wants and that we, the actual owners, and the people . who live here have no chance to challenge the application.' Cornwall sits on top on vast beds of metals and minerals and moves are underway to revive its famous tin mining industry. No intent: Officials deny the move signals any intent to start boring into the ground beneath the village's historic buildings - which date back as far as the 16th century . Duchy spokesmen deny the move signals any intent to start boring into the ground beneath the village's historic buildings - which date back as far as the 16th century. During the last few years experts discovered large deposits of an ultra-rare element - indium - at Cornwall's South Crofty, near Redruth, worth an estimated £200 million. The sought-after substance is used to make liquid crystal displays displays for iPads, satnavs and computer monitors. But the Duchy insists it has effectively owned the sub-soil beneath the 130,000-acre estate since its creation in 1337 and is 'simply registering its existing rights.' My land: Lord Salisbury recently angered residents in Welwyn Garden City with a similar claim . A spokesman said mining and mineral rights were not included on the original Stoke Climsland deeds because a 19th-century act of parliament granted the mines and minerals reservations separately to the Duchy. He added: 'Therefore the mines and minerals reservations do not have to be included in each individual sale.' The villagers' outrage comes after the Marquess of Salisbury angered residents of Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire earlier this month, after asserting his rights to his neighbours' land so he can dig for minerals under their homes. Campaigners rallied together to form a Facebook protest group after the former Tory Part leader in the House of Lords claimed his 'market and fair rights, sporting rights and rights in respect of the mines and minerals beneath the property'. Some residents feared that his claims may indicate plans for fracking in the area. Some suggested picketing the marquess' ancestral home, Hatfield House, wearing medieval costumes and 'waving pitchforks and burning torches'. His decision to register follows a law introduced by the Labour government in 2002 that stated all manorial rights would be lost if not registered with the Land Registry within an 11-year window. Now a number of landowners across the country are applying for manorial rights before that window closes this year.","The Duchy of Cornwall estate sent letters to Stoke Climsland residents .

"Andre Lake, 27, who was given the 'second chance' at the government department, used his pass to sneak into his co-workers' offices and steal a wallet and two BlackBerry phones . A convicted thief given a job at the Ministry of Justice as part of a rehabilitation programme was jailed for nine months yesterday for stealing from his colleagues. Andre Lake, 27, who was given the 'second chance' at the government department, used his pass to sneak into his co-workers' offices and steal a wallet and two BlackBerry phones. He also broke into a store cupboard and stole eight more BlackBerrys, worth £125 each. Nine days later he was sacked and arrested for staging a bomb hoax so he could get the day off work. Judge Anthony Pitts, sitting at Southwark Crown Court, said: 'What makes it infinitely worse is that from what I have read about you, you are an intelligent and able man who had been given a chance as an ex-offender by the Ministry of Justice which is a very good thing to see. 'Within three months you were using your staff pass to access various parts of the building, using your position and your pass to effect those thefts, that is a serious breach of trust.' Lake, who at the time was serving a suspended sentence for burglary, was given an 18-month community order with supervision and 200 hours of unpaid work for the bomb scare in November last year. Although the latest offences came earlier in time the decision to charge him only came recently. The administration officer in the Youth Justice Office had been employed through the offenders rehabilitation project on June 14, 2010. He first used his pass to sneak into his co-workers' office on September 22 and stole a wallet containing bank cards, driving licence, and a season ticket. A few days later he went into a technician's office and stole the two mobiles that were lying on his desk. Lake made two 999 calls from the office, one claiming there . was a bomb and the second posing as the building's head of security and . demanding to know where the emergency services were so he could go home . early . Then, on October 4, he made his way into the store cupboard and took eight BlackBerrys belonging to the Ministry of Justice. But managers were able to trace him as . the culprit on all occasions as he used his personal pass to swipe his . way into the crime scene. Referring . to the store cupboard theft John Keal, prosecuting, said: 'He had . previously emailed his line manager to say that he would not be . attending work that day because of Tube strikes but CCTV showed him in . the office when items were stolen.' Lake of Harrow, North London, pleaded guilty to the three charges of thefts. It was his security pass which also identified him as the hoax bomb caller. On . October 13 Lake made two 999 calls from the office, one claiming there . was a bomb and the second posing as the building's head of security and . demanding to know where the emergency services were so he could go home . early. When he was sentenced for that offence Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, told him: 'Idiotically you have thrown away this chance with such a ridiculous prank.' In August 2009 Lake was given a nine-month sentence suspended for two years after he was convicted of a kicking down the door of a residential property and ransacking it for valuables alongside an accomplice. The father-to-be was caught leaving the house with a stolen watch and marigold gloves to cover his fingerprints in his pocket but was given a chance by the MoJ. Judge Pitts said that he was 'nobody's fool' and must have known that the suspended sentence was like a 'sword that's likely to fall' hanging over his head. 'Despite the chance that you were given and despite that sword hanging over your head you went ahead and committed these offences. I have no alternative to pass a sentence of immediate custody,' Judge Pitts said. Three months of the suspended sentence was activated and Lake was given six-month concurrently for the thefts.","Andre Lake took a wallet and ten BlackBerry phones .

"A ten-year-old boy's brutal death at the hands of his stepfather could have been avoided after it was revealed the boy called 911 twice in the past year to report abuse. Abdifatah Mohamud, from Buffalo, New York, was found beaten to death in his family's basement last week. He was bound, gagged and struck repeatedly with a rolling pin. Though the Buffalo Police Department is investigating how officers handled the calls, they did confirm they reported the allegations to Erie County Child Protective Services - who are accused of not doing enough to help the boy or remove him from the home. They are refusing to comment on the case. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Abdifatah Mohamud, ten, called 911 several times to report abuse at the hands of his stepfather Ali Mohamed Mohamud, who is now accused of beating him to death . Scene: Police sealed off the Buffalo home after they found Abdifatah tied to a chair, gagged and beaten to death by a rolling pin after his mother reported him missing . A police department spokesman says the police commissioner ordered the investigation into 911 calls made in April 2011, when Abdifatah told authorities his stepfather Ali-Mohamad Mohamud was abusing him. Officers responding to a missing child report last week found the boy's body. The 40-year-old security guard has pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge. The Buffalo News said that the officers who responded to the 911 calls immediately reported the allegations to Erie County Child Protective Services and made a domestic incident report, which they also passed on to CPS. The agency failed to remove Abdifatah from the home after this report. Peter Anderson, spokesman for Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz, told the Buffalo News that confidentiality laws prevent him from commenting on any response by the county's Child Protective Services Division regarding Abdifatah. He said: 'Personally speaking, I have children of my own, and as a father, this tears at my heart. However, because of state law, we can't comment on this case.' Principal at International Preparatory School, where the ten-year-old was a fifth-grade student, said there were troubling warning signs, but the family did a good job of covering it up. Kathy Jamil said in June 2011 he came to school badly beaten up with a swollen forehead and two swollen, black eyes. His father told his teacher he had been in a fight on the bus with another boy. He had that day been 'horsing around' with another student but no one actually witnessed the alleged fight. Principal Jamil said: 'It was very suspicious. But because the . student had admitted to wrestling with him and pushing him, it was very . possible that he had just got hit the wrong way on the window. 'I tried . to stress in him that he would be safe with me, and he said, ""I just had . a fight on the bus"".' CPS officials were also said to have investigated after the boy showed up . severely bruised at school but never saw fit to remove him from the home. Principal Jamil also revealed to WIVB 4 that Abdifatah would say alarming things like: 'I'm going to get killed, I'm going to be in so much trouble', but then would follow it by laughing so no one was really sure if he was telling the truth. She said: 'The students, they've been saying, ""Maybe we should have said this"" or ""Maybe we should have been asking more"". The staff also wonders what they could have done differently.' Accused: Ali-Mohamed Mohamud, a Somalia native, admitted killing his stepson because he was trying to discipline him over falling behind in his homework . Haven: Principal at International Preparatory School where the ten-year-old was a fifth-grade student said there were troubling warning signs, but the family did a good job of covering it up . Warning signs: Kathy Jamil said in June 2011 Abdifatah came to school badly beaten up with a swollen forehead and two swollen, black eyes . According to the police report filed last April with CPS, Somalia-born Mohamud explained to the investigating officers that his stepson was accusing him of child abuse because of issues over the boy doing his homework. When he confessed to killing his son on April 17, he again said he was attempting to discipline his son, who he claimed was kicking him. The 40-year-old admitted tying up his son's hands, tying him to a chair, sticking a sock in his mouth before duct-taping it shut and then beating him with a rolling pin. He said it was the first time he ever harmed the boy. An autopsy found he had been struck 70 times. Police investigators were shocked over the viciousness of the . beating, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda. 'Every homicide is bad, but it is particularly hard to deal with for . first responders, police and others, when it is a ten-year-old child,' he said during a press conference. 'In talking to investigators, I was told it was one of the . most grisly crime scenes that they can remember, and some have been . here 40 years.' It was spring break and Abdifatah had just returned from staying at a relative's house for a week when he was killed. A neighbor, who did not want to be named, told officers she had seen him running for his life down the street. When she stopped to help him he told her: 'I don't want to go back with him.' The stepfather caught up with them and told her he had fallen behind in his homework and was running away before asking if she could give them a ride home. She agreed, telling Abdifatah: 'Your daddy says everything will be OK. If something happens come back and tell me tomorrow morning.' 'I may have been the last person to see him alive,' she admitted to police. It was almost a year before his death that police were called to the house by the frightened ten-year-old, who told them he was being abused, calling back shortly after to tell them to hurry. Officers reported they did not see any physical signs of abuse on the child when they arrived on April 18, 2011, though they did not ask him to take his clothes off for a closer examination. According to the Buffalo News, Mohamud downplayed the boy's claims of abuse by saying he and his stepson were at odds over him doing homework. School administrators and teachers said that Abdifatah was a good student who always submitted his homework on time. Two essays he wrote revealed he won awards for his work and was at one stage a top student in his class. He also said his teacher Miss Poole was his hero. Mohamud is married to the boy's mother, Shukri, and both have children from previous relationships totaling six children, according to the Buffalo News.

"Angel di Maria is set to make his Manchester United debut at Turf Moor on Saturday as Louis van Gaal's side take on Burnley in the Premier League. The £60million signing from Real Madrid has joined a team who has struggled to adapt to Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation and who are yet to win a game this season.

Brace: Dutchman Van Nistelrooy scored twice as United ran out 3-2 winners against Fulham in 2001 . Quiet: Veron (left) did not make as much of an impact as Van Nistelrooy did during United's win over Fulham . Wayne Rooney £27m (2004) Debuts don’t get much better than this. United beat Fenerbahce 6-2 in the Champions League, and hat-trick hero Rooney was the star man after his move from Everton. The 18-year-old scored with a tap-in, a 20-yard strike and a free-kick.

Impact: Berbatov had a quiet debut against Liverpool except this lovely flick back to Carlos Tevez to score . Robin van Persie £24m (2012) The signing from Arsenal had a debut to forget as his new side lost 1-0 to a spirited Everton team.

Day to forget: Robin van Persie (No 20) came off the bench against Everton but United lost 1-0 at Goodison Park . Disappointing: Van Persie did not score or make much of an impact off the bench as United lost to the Toffees . Marouane Fellaini £27.5m (2013) Fellaini was cheered on to the Old Trafford pitch by fans who were relieved that David Moyes had finally spent some money.

"New satellite images show the true extent of the record drought hitting California, as the state declares an emergency and seeks federal aid. The NOAA images show how the state's landscape is parched with minimal snow cover and the land dried out compared to the same time last year. The dry year California experienced in 2013 has left fresh water reservoirs with a fraction of their normal reserves and slowed the normally full American River so dramatically that brush and dry riverbed are showing through in areas normally teeming with fish. 'We can't make it rain, but we can be much better prepared for the terrible consequences that California's drought now threatens, including dramatically less water for our farms and communities and increased fires in both urban and rural areas,' Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement. Scroll down for video . Record drought: These satellite images show the parched California landscape this year compared to a normal year with plenty of foliage and snow coverage last year . Dry year: Governor Jerry Brown holds a chart showing statewide average precipitation as he speaks during a news conference today in San Francisco after declaring a drought state of emergency for  California . 'I've declared this emergency and I'm calling all Californians to conserve water in every way possible,' he said, in a move that will allow him to call for conservation measures and provide flexibility in deciding state water priorities. Speaking at a news conference in San Francisco, he said the drought threatens to leave farms and communities with dramatically less water and increases the risk of fires in both urban and rural areas. He appealed to residents to keep a lid on water use with the aim of reducing overall consumption by 20 percent, telling them that 'this takes everybody pitching in.' He warned that mandatory conservation programs may be initiated down the road. In a sign of the severity of the drought, some of the state's reservoirs are at their lowest levels in years. The Folsom Reservoir near Sacramento is so low that the remains of a Gold Rush-era ghost town - flooded to create the lake in the 1950s - are visible for the first time in years. The state's mountain ranges, where runoff from melting snow provides much of the water for California's thirsty cities and farms, have just 20 per cent of the snow they normally have at this time of year, officials noted. Parched: Water levels for many of California's major reservoirs are well below average and dropping; concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977 . Lake Shasta, the largest reservoir in California, is down from its historical average by nearly half. Other sources of water, including the massive Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, are also affected, prompting cities to dip into reserves and forcing farmers to scramble. Some public agencies may be able to purchase just five per cent of the water that they contracted to buy from the state. Adding to concerns, January and February are usually the wettest months in much of the state, but 2014 has so far been mostly dry, with little precipitation expected, according to the National Weather Service. In declaring a drought emergency, Brown said he did not know if he would be successful in persuading the federal government to free up funds for drought relief but he would try his best.'It's important, first of all, to awaken all Californians to the serious matter of drought,' he said, also warning of upcoming 'conflicts and different perceptions on how water is to be allocated.' Water has long been a contentious issue in California, where it has been diverted from mountain lakes and streams to irrigate farms and slake the thirst of metropolitan areas. Tinderbox: Firefighter Jeff Newby sprays water as he battles the Colby Fire today near Azusa, California . Working around the clock: A truck clears away rocks along San Gabriel Canyon Road as firefighters continue to battle the Colby Fire that was sparked Thursday morning . Many of the state's efforts to deal with the problem are controversial, including a $25 billion plan to divert water from above the delta by sending it through a pair of huge tunnels. For many in the state's $44.7 billion agriculture business, water scarcity is a problem made worse by a recent switch to orchard-style crops such as almonds and olives. Unlike vegetables or cotton, which grow in fields that can be left fallow in dry years, the trees need water every year. Already, there were signs of competing priorities among groups that contend for water and will be closely watching how state officials use their new flexibility in allocating it. Assemblywoman Connie Conway, the leader of the Republican minority in the state Assembly who represents a heavily agricultural area in central California, expressed hope that with the declaration more water could go toward 'Valley farmers and workers who depend on water to feed the world.' Low and dropping: Governor Jerry Brown points to images showing the snow depth in the Sierra mountains on January 13, 2013 (left) and January 13, 2014 (center) while declaring a drought state of emergency in San Francisco . John McManus, executive director of the Golden Gate Salmon Association, said his group's concern was for the health of salmon and a fishing industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs in California and Oregon. 'If the drought declaration results in more attention to saving the salmon that are in the Sacramento Valley rivers, and which are in dire need of attention, then that is good thing,' he said. Doug Obegi, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said California has a complex system that allocates water to areas that laid claim to it first - often over 100 years ago - and which many view the system as unfair. 'Because it's so contentious, there are times when it's hard to make progress,' Obegi said. But in some ways the state has done well. Over the last 40 years, the state's agriculture industry has doubled the revenue per drop of water used, largely from improved efficiency and changes in the plants grown, Obegi said.","Governor Jerry Brown has declared a drought emergency .

"Elon Musk (right) will install the stations along the M20 from London to Dover, across the entire M25, along the M4 from London to Bristol and the M1 and M6 to Manchester via Birmingham . Motorways are to become ‘electric superhighways’ in an attempt to persuade drivers to switch to battery-powered cars. ‘Supercharging stations’ are to be installed on several major roads by the end of the year, enabling electric cars to travel across the country in one trip for the first time. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is fitting the devices, which can charge the Tesla electric cars his company makes in 20 minutes, giving a range of 130 miles. This is far faster than most current electric cars, which often require overnight charging and have a range of under 100 miles. It means electric car owners will be able to drive large distances across Britain without concerns about running out of power, known as ‘range anxiety’. The first network will stretch from Dover to London along the M20, cover the entire M25 and follow the M4 from London to Bristol and the M1 and M6 to Manchester via Birmingham. Tesla declined to say which service stations would be used, but installation work was reported to be almost complete on the South Mimms services at the junction of the M25 and the A1 in Hertfordshire. The network will also expand across much of Europe to enable owners to take the Channel Tunnel and drive on the Continent. Tesla hopes motorists will be able to take its cars from northern Norway to southern Spain by the end of 2014. Drivers will be able to get a range of 240 miles for 40 minutes charging or 300 miles for 75 minutes charging with a Tesla Model S Performance Plus car, which costs £70,000. Drivers will be able to get a range of 240 miles for 40 minutes charging with a Tesla Model S Performance Plus car, which costs £70,000 (pictured) Electric cars are becoming more popular in Britain, but sales have been held back by a lack of charging points . Motorists do not have to wait with the car while it is charging. Tesla drivers will have unlimited access to the network for either a one-off fee or included in the top price of the cars. Mr Musk was announced as the Government’s ‘electric car tsar’ in November. Despite efforts by the Government’s Office for Low-Emission Vehicles, which has £900million of taxpayers’ cash to play with, electric cars have so far failed to spark much interest in the British motoring market. Only 1,547 pure electric cars were registered in Britain from January to April this year, just 0.18 per cent of total car sales. A major drawback has been problems for motorists who are trying to find a public charging point on the street or at a supermarket and making sure they have the right cable for it. Edmund King, president of the AA, said that Tesla could be a ‘game changer’ for the top end of the market. He said: ‘The car looks good and is desirable. If it can be partially charged in 20 minutes and has a 300-mile range, then it should satisfy 98 per cent of drivers.’ Ecotricity and ChargeMaster are also expected to develop high-speed charging networks, but cars using them are not expected to have such a long range. Elon Musk is known as the real-life Iron Man after he was said to have inspired Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal of the genius inventor in the superhero films. Mr Musk made his fortune with the online payment system PayPal, which he sold to eBay in 2002 for £1billion, using the proceeds to launch SpaceX, which has a £2billion contract with Nasa to deliver cargo to the International Space Station. In 2003 he set up luxury electric car company Tesla, and last year unveiled a futuristic plan for a ‘Hyperloop’, a new type of transport that would send passengers in capsules along a tube at the speed of sound. South African-born Mr Musk has five sons by his first wife Justine, whom he divorced in 2010. He later married British actress Talulah Riley, star of the recent St Trinian’s films. The couple divorced in 2012 but have since reunited. Miss Riley, educated at top girls’ school Haberdashers’ Aske’s, once said: ‘I fell in love with Elon because of our mutual love of physics. I’m interested in philosophy, and talking to Elon I realised my questions could be answered with physics.’","Elon Musk, owner of electric car-maker Tesla, building charging stations .

"The great-granddaughter of General Foods founder and heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post has been found slain at her luxury spa resort on the Caribbean island of Roatan, Honduras police said Friday.Roatan police chief Alex Madrid said Nedenia Post Dye, 46, was found stabbed in her room on December 22. He said police had arrested a local singer whom Dye was helping quit drugs. 'She was a good woman who worked with young people at risk, drug addicts and alcoholics,' Madrid said. Island murder: Nedenia Dye had been living in Roatan, Honduras for 15 years when she was stabbed to death . The suspect, Lenin Roberto Arana, 25, told police that he and Dye had been romantically involved, Madrid said. Arana, who used the stage name 'The Canary,' told local reporters that he was innocent. Madrid said Dye had been living for 15 years on Roatan, where she ran the Baan Suerte luxury spa. Apprehended: Local musician Lenin Roberto Arana has been accused of killing Dye . Dye, of Santa Monica, California, told an alumni publication of her alma mater, George Washington University, last year that she shared a love of risk-taking and adventure with her great-grandmother, who inherited the cereal company that she eventually turned into General Foods Inc. 'My friend and I had an idea to start . a business,' Dye told the alumni magazine. 'I wanted to go to Asia but . she said ""No, Central America is closer. If (the business) fails, we can . swim home.""'Madrid said Arana had been captured wearing blood-soaked clothing as he tried to flee in Dye's car. 'I'm innocent,' Arana told local reporters. 'Nedenia was like a mother to me. She protected me.' Police said Dye appeared to have been stabbed many times in the back. Local businesswoman: Dye had been running a luxury spa on the island for years and was very involved in the local community . Heiress, socialite and businesswoman: Dye's grandmother was Marjorie Merriweather Post, who inherited a fortune and amassed an even larger one with her General Foods company . Madrid told Page Six last night: 'Señora Dye was murdered by Lenin Roberto Arana Carlos, also known as the musician Canario, with whom she was in a romantic relationship. We believe she was a victim of domestic violence. 'He allegedly killed her because he wanted to get crack. It was apparent he was under the influence of drugs. He has been charged with her murder. Her body has been transferred to the mainland for an autopsy.' Other reports call Arana Dye's husband. Roatan is an island renowned for its scenic beaches, scuba diving, luxury resorts and vacation homes.","Nedenia Post Dye, 46, was found stabbed to death at her Honduras home .

"Cars could be driving themselves down European streets far sooner than expected, thanks to a change in a global treaty backed by European countries. A little-noticed amendment to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic agreed last month would let drivers take their hands off the wheel of self-driving cars. It was pushed by Germany, Italy and France, whose high-end carmakers believe they are ready to zoom past American tech pioneers and bring the first 'autonomous vehicles' to market. Scroll down for video . Driving test: The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) will grant licenses to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. A Google self-driving car, a white Lexus, is pictured . The amendment agreed last month by the U.N. Working Party on Road Traffic Safety would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. Provided the amendment clears all bureaucratic hurdles, all 72 countries that are party to the convention would have to work the new rules into their laws. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. 'Today I am only allowed to take my hands off the wheel to a limited extent,' said Thomas Weber, head of Group research at Daimler and head of development at Mercedes-Benz. 'Thankfully the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic has been changed.' For years, so-called 'autonomous vehicles' have been a futuristic dream pioneered by silicon valley companies like Google. But as the technology becomes more affordable, Europe's luxury automakers say they are well placed to take advantage of it because of their deeper experience in engineering, manufacturing, marketing and sales. There is no point in waiting while California upstarts catch up, they say. The U.S. state of Nevada passed a law in June 2011 to allow test drives of autonomous vehicles there. Google tested one in 2012. In August 2013, Mercedes-Benz responded to the Google push by developing an S-class limousine which drove between Mannheim and Pforzheim without any driver input. The 103 kilometer stretch is known as the Bertha Benz route, named after the driver of the first ever motorcar more than 125 years ago. But moving from test drives to marketable products was held back by Article 8 of the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic, which stipulates: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' The amendment agreed last month by the U.N. Working Party on Road Traffic Safety would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. Provided the amendment clears all bureaucratic hurdles, all 72 countries that are party to the convention would have to work the new rules into their laws. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. What Google's car sees: An interior view of a Google self-driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to 'see' the road. The amendment was submitted by the governments of Germany, Italy, France, Germany, Belgium and Austria, according to the April 17 U.N. document - showing just how important the new technology is for Europe. Germany's premium carmakers in particular have business models that rely on leading the market in vehicles with the most sophisticated features available. They can't afford to fall behind. Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW as well as auto suppliers Bosch and Continental are working on technologies for autonomous or semi-autonomous cars. Mercedes has developed technology which can scan the road ahead and behind with cameras and radar, and prompt a vehicle to pull out and overtake a large truck without a driver having to touch the steering wheel. It now wants to introduce more automated driving features into its cars, such as automated parking, automatic stop-and-go driving in traffic and motorway driving functions. Eventually, it hopes to have cars with elaborate self-driving software that can be easily updated - like an iPhone - to take advantage of new technical capabilities or changes in the law. 'We have developed a car that can drive autonomously. Now the legal framework needs to follow suit,' a Daimler spokeswoman said. It would be hard to mistake the gold Lexus RX 450h cars that Google has converted into self-driving prototypes for normal cars, primarily because of the roof-mounted laser sensor that revolves 10 times a second, gathering a 360-degree view of the car's surroundings.Other drivers who spot the self-driving car often swerve in front of it and tap on their brakes, hoping to gauge the Google car's reaction, according to the two Google staffers in the car's front seats. Another favorite involves car drivers waving their hands in the air, in an attempt to get the Google driver-seat staff member to take his or her own hands off the wheel and prove the car is really steering itself. 'We just laugh at them,' said one of the Google staff members in the car. From the car's backseat, the ride feels little different from sitting in a taxi. The car's speed, the distance it maintains from the vehicle in front and its handling, for the most part, feel completely ordinary. Changing lanes occasionally feels sharper than typical, and the car slowed down at a green light at one point until its sensors were able to 'read' a traffic light that was apparently mounted at an odd angle.The Google staff member in the driver's seat never took control of the car, other than the initial passage through a speed bump-laden parking lot, and once again on arrival. Alexei Oreskovic, Reuters . Last week a fleet of Google's robot cars ferried more than two dozen reporters around Mountain View, California, on Tuesday, in 30-minute ride-alongs that showcased their ability to automatically and safely navigate around city streets packed with cyclists, pedestrians and traffic signs. The demonstrations, along with a morning of press briefings by Google managers developing the technology, marked the company's most concerted effort to date to provide an up-close look at the cars conceived five years ago in its secretive Google X division. The public needs to understand that a self-driving car is 'not something that you need to fear but something you need to embrace,' said Ron Medford, a former National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration official who is now director of safety for Google's self-driving car project. 'We do find that when people experience it, we get remarkable results and responses,' Medford said at the event at the Computer History Museum, during which Google explained the technology that makes the cars work. Sensors including radar and lasers create 3D maps of a self-driving car's surroundings in real-time, while Google's software sorts objects into four categories. These include moving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and static objects such as signs, curbs and parked cars. Initially, the car’s capabilities were fairly crude. A group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person. Now, the technology can distinguish individuals, according to Google spokeswoman Courtney Hohne. To deal with cyclists, engineers initially programmed the software to look for hand gestures that indicate an upcoming turn. Then they realised that most cyclists don't use standard gestures - and still others weave down a road the wrong way. A camera peers out from the front grill of Google's self-driving car in Mountain View, California, as Google revealed exactly how the car works . Engineers have taught the software to predict the behaviour of cyclists based on thousands of encounters during the approximately 10,000 miles (16,000 km) the cars have driven autonomously on city streets, Hohne said. The software projects a cyclist's likely movements and plots the car's path accordingly - then reacts if something unexpected happens. ‘A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to different rules of the road in a small area,’ Urmson wrote. Before recent breakthroughs, Google had considered mapping all the world's stop signs. Now the technology can read stop signs, including those held in the hands of school crossing guards, Hohne added. Google will not say whether it will build its own cars or license the technology to automakers, nor will it provide a firm date for when the cars will be available. Co-founder Brin has said the technology could be available by 2017. Google's cars have never 'caused' an accident in self-driving mode, although they have been involved in a few fender benders, such as an incident in which a Google car stopped at a red light got rear-ended, said Chris Urmson, the head of Google's self-driving car project. Unlike human drivers, self-driving cars never get drowsy behind the wheel, and they can react to unforeseen situations much more quickly, he said.","Change in United Nations Convention on Road Traffic gives EU advantage .

"Jailed: Clerk Debabish Majumber outside Kingston Crown Court, where he received a suspended jail sentence for looking at porn during a rape case . A ‘bored’ court clerk who was caught watching porn by a judge during a rape trial has been spared jail. Debasish Majumder, 54, sat casually viewing explicit online material while a sex attack victim gave evidence at Inner London Crown Court. Majumder, from Haringey, north London, who had been working for the . courts service for 27 years, confessed to routinely watching . internet porn when he was bored. ‘I only looked at porn because the case . was boring and did so once or twice a week since December 2009,’ he said . in his police interview. He was spotted by Judge Nigel Seed QC viewing the footage, and he subsequently reported the incident. Detectives then found indecent pseudo images of children and extreme porn on his home computer. Kingston Crown Court heard the married . father-of-one made a series of porn searches during the rape trial in early December 2010. He also looked at non-sexual material with no relevance to his work. Sentencing Majumder to seven months in . prison, suspended for two years, Judge Nicholas Price QC said: ‘I’m told . by your counsel that you didn’t think anyone could see what you were . doing - you were wrong. 'The learned judge conducting the trial saw very . clearly what you did. ‘It’s incomprehensible that a man of . your age and experience should behave in such an appalling way. It is . inexcusable and reprehensible and you have no one to blame but yourself. ‘The very fact there are no comparable cases shows how rare, if not unique your case must be. ‘You have lost almost everything . including your job, your good name and the probable consequences are you . will find it almost impossible to find another form of employment. ‘You have brought shame upon yourself, your wholly innocent wife and your son. ‘But at 54, with a hitherto unblemished record, you have built up a credit balance and you are entitled to withdraw from that.’ Majunder was caught watching porn during a rape trial at Inner London Court . Prosecutor Annabel Darlow told the . court how Judge Seed noticed ‘cartoon-like’ images on his clerk’s . computer but was unable to ascertain whether they were sexual. ‘I think it was farm yard animals but if it was pornographic I couldn’t tell,’ the judge said in a statement. ‘Later I could see he was looking at a list of pornographic websites and I was shocked.’ The judge also said he saw an image of a woman with blonde hair performing a sex act on a man. ‘I watched him on Friday to see if I was mistaken. I looked down at his computer screen and again saw a list of websites. ‘I decided that was enough, I was not mistaken.’ Defending, Susannah Stephens said: . ‘These are images that people view perfectly lawfully in a number of . different environments and it’s right to say that Mr Majumder was of the . belief that no one else would be able to see what he was doing. ‘He had no knowledge the judge would be . able to see, he thought in light of where he was sitting that he would . block the judge’s view of the screen and what he was looking at would be . too small for the judge to see. ‘He accepts fully that what he did amounts to misconduct. ‘Prior to this, there wasn’t a single blemish on his record.’ Majumder admitted a single count of misconduct in public office, seven counts of possessing indecent pseudo images of children and an additional count of possessing extreme pornography. He will now be supervised for 18 months and must sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. His computer usage will also be monitored and he will be subject to a sex offender’s prevention order for five years.","Clerk thought no one could see his computer screen .

"The world's highest-paid hedge fund manager - who is worth an estimated $10 billion - has split from his wife, friends have revealed. David Tepper, 56, and his wife, Marlene, 55, have not yet formally filed for divorce but have separated and are telling friends that the marriage 'has run its course', a source told PageSix. 'They hope to settle things quickly, quietly and amicably,' the source said. The head of $20 billion Appaloosa Management is worth an estimated $10 billion and made $3.5 billion in 2013 alone - meaning that divorce proceedings could reach eye-watering sums. Split: Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper and his wife Marlene are divorcing, according to sources . Forbes lists him as the 129th richest person in the world. The Teppers, who married in 1986, have three children in their 20s, Brian, Randi, and Casey. They share a mansion in Livingston, New Jersey and a $43.5 million oceanfront estate in the Hamptons. As well as running his company in Short Hills, New Jersey, Tepper, who grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Tepper worked as a trader at Goldman Sachs for eight years but left to start up his own hedge fund, Appaloosa Management, in 1992 after repeatedly being passed over for partnership. In 2009, he made a trade that netted his company $7.5 billion and gave him a payout of nearly $4 billion. 'What do you think I should do with it?' he asked New York Magazine afterwards. 'I could buy an island. I could buy a private jet... I could get myself a 22-year-old!' Family: The Teppers have three children in their 20s, Brian, Randi, and Casey, who grew up in New Jersey . Close: Brian pictured with Randi. The family hired Ashlee Simpson to sing at one of the girls' bat mitzvahs . In 2012, he was ranked as the top-earning investor and was paid $4.4 billion. In 2013, he took home $3.5 billion. 'His track record has long been phenomenal,' Forbes reported in its rich list. 'But since the financial crisis his returns have reached a whole new level.' In 2011, he bought a $43.5 million Hamptons estate from Joanne Corzine, the ex-wife of his former Goldman boss, Jon Corzine. At the time, it was reported that Tepper was irked that he couldn't see the ocean from every room of the sprawling 6,165 square foot estate, so he decided to build another one from the ground up. 'I'm ready to be rich,' he said at the time. But he's also happy to share his wealth. Last year, he gave $67 million to his alma mater Carnegie Mellon University, adding to the $55 million he gave in 2004, Forbes reported. Mansion: Tepper and his wife Marlene share this large home in Livingston, New Jersey . Massive: The family also owns this oceanfront estate in the Hamptons. Tepper bought a $43.5m mansion and knocked it down to make way for this home, which is twice the size of the original property . He has also made several large gifts to the University of Pittsburgh, where he completed his undergraduate education. His wife is a member of the board of overseers at Rutgers University, where the couple also donated $3.4 million to the Mason Gross School of the Arts. The Teppers were spotted together in May at a charity dinner for the Robin Hood Foundation. Tepper is also a major donor to that foundation. And after Hurricane Sandy, Tepper donated $200,000 in gift cards to New Jersey families who had suffered loss in the storm. His spokesman declined to comment.","David Tepper, 56, and his wife Marlene, 55, have separated after telling friends that their marriage 'has run its course', sources said .

"The two children suffocated by their mother in Spain were not fathered by her paedophile partner, a court heard yesterday. Lianne Smith looked furious when the shock DNA results were read out to the jury and denounced them as 'mistaken'. She has admitted killing Rebecca, five, and 11-month-old Daniel in their hotel beds on the Costa Brava in May 2010 after her partner was arrested on child sex charges. The jury of seven men and two women retired to consider their verdicts at 11.30am local time. Scroll down to see the interview where Lianne admits to killing her children... Smith admits suffocating Rebecca and Daniel but claims to have been in an unsound mental state at the time of the killings . Lianne Smith is led into court in Girona, Spain, this morning on the third day of her murder trial, where the court heard DNA tests prove her partner did not father her victims . Judge Adolfo Garcia Morales told them that if they find Smith not guilty of murder on the grounds of insanity, she will be sent to a secure psychiatric hospital until she is cured. He said: 'If a person is completely insane they must be acquitted and there is no sentence. But they are not released into the street. 'They are sent to a secure psychiatric unit until they are cured. That might be two years or it might be 25 years. They are not released until they are cured.' The prosecution accepts Smith suffers from an unspecified psychosis but claim it is not too severe that she cannot be held accountable for her crimes. Defence lawyer Jenifer Lahoz Abos argues Smith suffers from such a severe mental illness she cannot be heard criminally responsible for their deaths. She is seeking an acquittal, claiming Smith was in a state of ‘psychiatric disturbance’ and suffering insurmountable fear when the tragedy happened. Martin Smith, who was found dead in his cell in January . Yesterday a psychiatrist claimed Smith smothered her children with a plastic bag 'out of love' because she did not want them taken into care. Her partner, TV hypnostist Martin Smith, hanged himself in prison earlier this year – believing his partner had killed his son and daughter. But they were not his children, the jury at Girona provincial court in north-east Spain, was told. A police witness, identified only by her badge number 12602, revealed: 'DNA tests on the children showed that Martin Smith was not their biological father.' Smith, 45, of Lichfield, Staffordshire, reacted with fury and insisted the tests were wrong. She gave birth to Daniel in 2009 while on the run in Spain with Mr Smith. Her daughter Rebecca had been born in the UK in 2005 while she and Mr Smith – who shared a surname but were not married – were living together. Their relationship was violent and Smith's two older children from a previous relationship, witnessed ugly rows. Her eldest daughter, Sarah Richardson, now 24, was repeatedly raped by her stepfather over nearly a decade. When she finally told police – and later waived her right to anonymity – Mr Smith was arrested but ran away to Spain before his trial. Smith fled with him, and while living a fugitive lifestyle in Barcelona, she found a job in a nursery, and then became pregnant with Daniel. The couple fled their first flat in Barcelona within hours of Daniel being born. An American neighbour told the Mail: 'It was very strange. She came back from hospital after giving birth to her little boy and left the same day. We never saw them again.' Police eventually tracked down Martin Smith in May 2010 and deported him to the UK where he was found guilty of sexually abusing his stepdaughter Sarah and sentenced to 16 years in prison. He committed suicide in January this . year, aged 46. Two weeks after his arrest, Lianne Smith, a former . manager of children's services at Cumbria county council, suffocated her . children in the Hotel Miramar in Lloret de Mar after giving them a . 'perfect holiday'. She spent the night with their  lifeless bodies before asking the hotel receptionist to call police. Martin Smith was previously thought to be the father of Daniel and Rebecca, whom his partner has admitted killing in a Spanish hotel room . Yesterday her trial heard she had . 'killed them out of love' – because she feared social services were . about to take them away.  Forensic psychiatrist Itziar Idiaquez Alberdi . said: 'She believed the children would be taken away from her and . institutionalised. For her, this was worse than death. 'She had spoken about this with her . partner (Martin Smith) and they had talked about taking their own lives . if they were ever separated.' Asked if Smith could distinguish between . good and evil when she killed the children, the psychiatrist replied: . 'She was convinced that it was the best thing she could do. She killed . them out of love. She loved the children.' Lianne Smith in court in Girona today, where she insisted the DNA test results must have been incorrect . Dragged: Smith being led from a police car into court during her trial . Prison psychiatrist Harry Barker said . Smith viewed the deaths of her two children as 'an unavoidable . catastrophe'. She suffered from a psychosis that made her lose contact . with reality, he told the court. Smith had asked her young daughter if . she would prefer to live 'a few very happy days with her mother or a . long time without her mother', he said. Rebecca had apparently answered she . wanted to stay with her mother. After killing the children, Smith cut . her wrists and attempted to hang herself. But forensic doctor Elisabet . Vazquez Martinez said Smith's injuries were only 'superficial'. The jury must decide if Smith is criminally responsible or mentally ill. The trial continues. Horror: Smith, with son Daniel, was placed on suicide watch after learning of her partner's hanging in prison .

"A Maine man charged with killing and dismembering his father was ordered Thursday to undergo a mental health evaluation at a court appearance that ended with him declaring himself 'the Lord, Father of life' and asking the gathered media to follow him on Twitter. Leroy Smith III, 24, 'stated that he filleted . him and buried him in the woods because his dad sexually assaulted him . his whole life,' an investigator wrote. A police affidavit said Smith told an officer he killed his father, Leroy Smith Jr, 56, by stabbing him in the neck then used three knives to chop up his body. Grisly murder: Leroy Smith III stands during his initial appearance in Kennebec County Superior Court, Thursday May 8, 2014, in Augusta, Maine . Slain: Leroy Smith III confessed to stabbing his father Leroy Smith, Jr (left and right) to death and 'filleting' him . Smith told an investigator he recorded at least . some of the crime and posted it on YouTube and Twitter, but removed the . postings and deleted the video from his camera and computer, according . to court records. The . defendant, who's being held without bail, did not enter a plea during . the hearing. Leaving the courtroom, he told reporters, 'I am the Lord, Father of life.' The . Associated Press does not generally identify potential victims of . sexual abuse. However, Smith later gave an interview to WGME-TV in which . he said he wanted to tell his story. In the interview, Smith confessed to the killing and suggested he did it for attention. 'I did this to get my name out there. How else will I get the attention of yourself?' he said. 'I'm a no one sitting up here in Maine.' According . to the Maine Press Herald, the affidavit revealed grisly details of the . killing, disclosing that Smith stabbed his father in the jugular vein . and dismembered him, spreading his remains among 16 trash bags. Smith told police that he videotaped the killing and that the FBI 'told him to put a video of the event on YouTube' but he later deleted the video. This  Monday, May 5, 2014, photo provided by the Cumberland County Jail shows Leroy Smith III.

(AP Photo/ Cumberland County Jail) He then make multiple trips to a local store to buy cleaning products including ammonia and bleach, even renting a carpet steamer to hid the evidence. Smith told police that he initially threw his father's remains into a Dumpster outside the apartment building, but retrieved them when they weren't taken away. He transferred the bags to a car and drove to Richmond, dumping them off Lincoln St. He told police he planned to return and bury his father's remains on Monday. His Twitter profile Thursday morning appeared to show a photo of Smith giving an obscene hand gesture. His last tweets, written on Sunday, include 'I have no magic!' and '... you have some spare time on your hands, and my father is dead (he is done writing songs for you most of the time).' In one Facebook post he declared that he’s the ‘head of the KKK’. On Monday, Smith flagged down a police officer and asked directions to a strip club. The officer looked the young man up and discovered an outstanding arrest warrant in Massachusetts. Bizarre rants: In posts to social media, Smith has claimed to be 'head of the KKK' and outside court, announced he was 'the Lord, father of life' Police said the case developed quickly . after the officer . arrested him on the fugitive warrant. Smith blurted out that he killed his . father at the jail, according to a state police detective. According to the Maine Press Herald, Smith 'made excited utterances that he killed his father' while at the jail. Police found body parts in 16 dark trash bags, and a T-shirt and other blood-stained clothing off Lincoln Street in Richmond, according to the affidavit. One of the first bags to be opened contained a jeans-clad human leg. The younger man led investigators to his father's body using a signed map and verbal instructions, police said.

"Donor: David Ross, 48, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and a friend of David Cameron, is understood to be a leading candidate . A multi-millionaire Tory donor yesterday emerged as a front-runner to take over schools watchdog Ofsted. David Ross, 48, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and a friend of David Cameron, is understood to be a leading candidate. He has advised the Conservatives on education policy and used part of his £892million fortune to set up 25 academy schools. But any move by Education Secretary Michael Gove to install him as Ofsted chairman could prove highly controversial. Labour sources warned the appointment of a major donor to the crucial post would raise questions about whether the recruitment process was ‘open and transparent’. Mr Gove came under fire when he sacked Labour supporter Baroness Morgan, the outgoing chairman of Ofsted, earlier this year. Mr Ross has given £230,000 to the Conservative Party since 2006. But he has hit the headlines as often for his glamorous girlfriends as for his political involvement. Born in Grimsby to the wealthy family behind Ross Frozen Foods, he was educated privately at Uppingham School, where he met his future business partner, Charles Dunstone. They set up Carphone Warehouse in 1989 with an investment of £6,000. Today it is worth around £1.8billion. His girlfriends have included rugby player Will Carling’s ex-fiancee Ali Cockayne, Ralph Lauren muse Saffron Aldridge and former model Shelley Ross, with whom he has a son. He left Carphone Warehouse in 2008 and now dedicates much of his time to good causes through the David Ross Foundation and the David Ross Education Trust. He is one of a number of candidates being considered by Mr Gove for Ofsted chairman, Sky News said yesterday. Other names mooted for the role include Theodore Agnew, who is chairman of the Department for Education’s academies board and has given £144,000 to the Tories. Labour sources voiced concerns that Ofsted, whose current chief inspector is Sir Michael Wilshaw, could become too politicised. A spokesman said: ‘If a major Tory donor was to receive a senior role like this, people would want full assurances that the recruitment process has been open and transparent. Without this, motivations behind the appointment would inevitably be brought into question.’ A Lib Dem source added: ‘The chair of Ofsted should be appointed based on their ability and suitability for the role, not . . . their political outlook.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘An independent panel decides who is long-listed, short-listed and interviewed. ‘After this process is complete, they recommend to ministers a list.’ A spokesman for Mr Ross declined to comment, while education sources last night played down suggestions he is a shoo-in. A source stressed Mr Ross put himself forward and would be one of ‘a number of names’.

"The teen accused of shooting a toddler between the eyes during a robbery attempt counted down from five before firing, his alleged accomplice testified today after pointing him out as the shooter. Dominique Lang testified that he ran into De'Marquise Elkins on the morning of the March 21 slaying. A short while later as the two walked together, they saw Sherry West with a stroller. Lang says Elkins walked to West and demanded her purse before pulling out a gun. When West refused to hand the purse over, he hit her in the face with it and threatened her baby. 'The baby was in the stroller screaming,' Lang said. Alleged accomplice: Dominique Lang points out defendant De'Marquise Elkins during testimony on Thursday, August 22, as the shooter of a 13-month-old baby . In court: De'Marquise Elkins is charged with murder, child cruelty, attempted armed robbery and multiple counts of aggravated assault in connection to the March 21 shooting . Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother . Elkins shot Sherry West in the leg with his .22 caliber handgun, he testified, and then shot the 13-month-old baby Antonio Santiago. De'Marquise Elkins is charged with murder, child cruelty, attempted armed robbery and multiple counts of aggravated assault in connection to the March 21 shooting. If convicted, Elkins will not face the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the killing, too young under Georgia law to be executed. Prosecutors have also accused Elkins of shooting Wilfredo Calix Flores outside a local church ten days before the child was killed. The killing this spring in the port of city of Brunswick, close to vacation spots like Jekyll Island, drew national attention, and the trial was moved to the Atlanta suburbs because of the extensive publicity the case received locally. In opening statements, Johnson told jurors that both shootings started off as robberies. 'When it didn't happen immediately, as Mr Elkins thought it should, his reaction was to shoot,' Johnson alleged. 'The young man took the gun and aimed it . at Antonio's head and shot him right between the eyes,' Brunswick . District Attorney Jackie Johnson told jurors. Sworn in: Lang says Elkins walked to West and . demanded her purse before pulling out a gun. When West refused to hand . the purse over, he hit her in the face with it and threatened her baby . The prosecutor said Elkins and Lang stopped the mother and child as they returned home from the post office. Johnson said that Elkins pointed a small .22-caliber revolver at West and demanded her money. West did not immediately hand over her purse and the child was shot. Bystanders and rescue workers were unable to revive the child, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Lang is also charged as an adult with murder but will be tried separately. Authorities said Lang identified Elkins as the shooter. Defense attorney Jonathan Lockwood suggested that Antonio's parents were somehow involved in his death, though he did not provide a precise motive or further explain that theory. He said that no one in the neighborhood saw or heard anyone fleeing the scene of the shooting. He also questioned whether police focused their investigation too soon on the wrong suspects. He said that West tried to collect on a life insurance policy shortly after her son's death. 'The police were under a great deal of pressure to see that the matter was resolved as vacation season was not far away,' Lockwood said. On trial for murder: De'Marquise Elkins, 17, appears in court on Monday over the death of a 13-month-old baby who was shot dead in Brunswick, Georgia . For more videos, please go to WSB TV . Lockwood said the child's parents both . had gunshot residue on their hands. A report filed earlier by the . Georgia Bureau of Investigation said that gunshot residue can wind up on . shooting victims. The child's father, Louis Santiago, said during an . initial court hearing that he touched the bullet wound on West's leg . before his hands were swabbed. Prosecutors . said information from Elkins' mother and sister led investigators to a . pond where they found a .22-caliber revolver. Elkins' mother, Karimah Elkins, is standing trial alongside her son on charges . of evidence tampering and lying to police. Elkins' sister was also . charged with evidence tampering. An . attorney for Karimah Elkins, J. Wrix McIlvaine, said police had . violated her rights and that she was not involved in the killing. McIlvaine said, 'None of these people had anything to do with the shooting of a child.' Conspiracy: The defense has suggested that the baby's parents killed him to collect his life insurance . Incriminating: West's 21-year-old daughter told a TV . station that her mother called her after Antonio's murder wondering how . long it would take to receive a check from the life insurance company . Spared: Because of his youth, Elkins will not be facing capital punishment, if convicted . Elkins was last a student in the . system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative . school program, Weidhaas said. Both . prosecutors and Elkins' defense attorneys declined to comment before . the trial, citing a gag order by the judge. The boy's mother also . declined to talk. In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was . stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the . stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges. History of violence: Prosecutors said Elkins shot somebody else 10 days before the toddler was killed . Family: Elkins' mother and sister provided information that led police to a pond where they found a .22 caliber revolver . Defense . attorneys also pointed to lab tests by the Georgia Bureau of . Investigation that found traces of gunshot residue on swabs taken from . the hands of West and the boy's father, Louis Santiago. Reports . filed in court stated the GBI found a single microscopic particle of . gunshot residue swabbed from the father's hands, while more than five . particles showed up in swabs from West's hands. The . GBI report cautioned that gunshot victims can end up with residue on . them. During a preliminary court hearing, Santiago said he touched the . bullet wound on West's leg before his hands were swabbed. In . a court filing on Wednesday, District Attorney Jackie Johnson argued that . Elkins' defense lawyers have made ‘false, inflammatory and misleading . statements’ about the case. While . the toddler's mother identified Elkins as the shooter in a photo . lineup, police said much of their evidence against the teenager came . from his own family and the younger teen charged as his accomplice. Grief: Antonio's father Luis Santiago tries to comfort Ms West at her apartment on Friday . Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money . Investigators . have testified that Lang told police he and Elkins were trying to rob a . woman pushing a baby in a stroller when Elkins pulled a gun and shot . them both. Lang's aunt, . Debra Obey, told police her nephew and Elkins came to her for a ride . the day of the slaying. She said Elkins ducked down in the back seat of . her car, as if he was hiding. Four . days after the shooting, police said information from Elkins' mother . and sister helped lead investigators to a pond where they found a . .22-caliber revolver. Both . women were charged with evidence tampering. Elkins' mother, Karimah . Elkins, also was charged with lying to police. Prosecutors say Elkins' mother and an aunt gave police conflicting alibis for his whereabouts at . the time of the shooting. Karimah Elkins is scheduled to stand trial . alongside her son.

"If Dave Hockaday is to prolong what appears a doomed existence as Leeds manager then a first West Yorkshire derby defeat in 28 years – in which another of his players was sent off and he was mocked by his own fans – will hardly aid his sorry cause. The 56-year-old cut a shocked and lonely figure amid the cauldron of noise that greeted the climax of a pulsating tie which – for 115 seconds – had even threatened the most unlikely reprieve for the under-fire boss. That two-minute period was the time between Matt Smith’s 82nd-minute breakthrough for 10-man Leeds and Billy Knott’s stunning leveller. Fast forward another 90 seconds and Bradford, thanks to James Hanson’s header, were in front. Hero: Bradford City forward James Hanson is congratulated after scoring his side's late second goal . Bradford 4-4-2:  Williams 6; Darby 7, McArdle 6, Sheehan 6.5, Meredith 6; Kennedy 6, Liddle 6.5, Clarke 7.5, Knott 7 (Dolan 97); Mclean 6 (McBurnie 70), Hanson 6 .

Subs Not Used: Antenucci, Silvestri, Ajose, Charlie Taylor, Cook, Benedicic . Sent Off: Murphy . Booked: Murphy, Cooper . Goals: Smith 82 . Att: 18,750 . Ref: Graham Scott (Oxfordshire) The reward for the League One side – beaten finalists in this competition two years ago – is a trip to MK Dons – conquerors of Manchester United - in four weeks’ time. Hockaday, though, cannot look beyond Saturday’s visit of Bolton. Indeed, he may not make it that far, for owner Massimo Cellino had exited Valley Parade even before the late drama and chants of 'You're getting sacked in the morning' emanating from the away end. In the wake of last weekend’s 4-1 defeat at Watford – in which Giuseppe Bellusci and Sam Byram were dismissed – there was talk that Cellino was set to axe the former Forest Green Rovers manager just five games into his surprise tenure. But Hockaday has hardly been helped by his players’ indiscipline and Luke Murphy was red carded after just 31 minutes. The midfielder had already tried his damnedest to be sent off for a knee-high lunge on Gary Liddle before he collected a second yellow for an equally irresponsible challenge on James Meredith. And Hockaday said: ‘One player has given us a mountain to climb. But we pretty much climbed that mountain. ‘The rest of the team were magnificent to a man. As the game wore on we got stronger and got our reward with the goal. ‘When we scored I was proud of the boys and then thought “right, how do we kill the game?”. ‘But sometimes you have to say “that’s a great strike”. Then we had to steady it down but a couple of lads slipped in the box and their player got the run on them and he’s scored the winner.' Ouch: Luke Murphy was booked for a second time for this challenge on James Meredith . Marching orders: Murphy was dismissed in the first half to make Leeds' task even harder . Not exactly eye-to-eye: Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and Leeds striker Billy Sharp come to blows . Is Hockaday confident, then, he will see the weekend? ‘I’ve got a job to do and the players are behind me,’ he answered. ‘They have come to see me and they’re desperate to do well for Leeds. ‘We’ve been written off and we’re making it difficult for ourselves on the pitch with the red cards. But the team spirit is there and we have to take this on the chin. 'It’s a difficult situation and the sooner we win a game the better. ‘But my approach has just been one of determination. I’m a fighter, not a quitter. My concern is the team but I just feel things aren’t going their way. ‘In the dressing-room they are devastated and we do feel we can turn things around. We cannot wait for Saturday and that is where we are now looking.’ Head boy: Matt Smith looked to have won the game for Leeds when he headed them in front late on . Leveller: Billy Knott scored the equaliser after Leeds had edged in front with eight minutes remaining . Game on: Knott celebrates his goal that levelled the game before Bradford went on to win the tie . Opposite number Phil Parkinson, meanwhile, was thrilled with his side’s comeback, achieved thanks to Knott’s 25-yard fizzer and Hanson’s stooping header. ‘We created chances but we just had to be patient against 10 men. We went behind and it took a bit of inspiration from Billy to get us back in – it was top class,’ he said. ‘To then get the winner was brilliant and I’m proud of my players, it was a crazy end but it was a fantastic night for the club. It’s a big moment for this club because we know what it meant to the people of Bradford. ‘We gave everything to make a bit of history and won at Valley Parade for the first time in over 80 years.’ Under pressure: Dave Hockaday is on borrowed time at Leeds after another defeat .

"Michael Sam vowed today to help win the Super Bowl for the Dallas Cowboys  - but first he has to make the team. The first openly-gay NFL player suited up with the Cowboys this afternoon after coaches picked him for the practice squad as a defensive end. He has the option to make the team if he plays well enough. The decision by one of the league's most popular teams means that Sam's dreams of football stardom get another chance after he was cut earlier this week by the St. Louis Rams. In a press conference today, Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett said: . 'We feel like he has a chance to come in at a position we’ve tried to . address really throughout the off-season, throughout training camp, and . compete for a spot... We just want to give him a chance to come in and . see if he can help our football team.'

On Tuesday night as he jetted out of St. Louis, Sam exclusively told MailOnline that he was 'excited to be to be joining Dallas, I just want to play football.'

Students Trey Woodberry, Desedric Johnson, and Kentron Haskinwere were pronounced dead after the the violent accident in Dallas, Texas. A relative identified two of the other passengers as stepsisters Quatia Ervin, 21, and Kannesha Bradford, 23, according to The Dallas Morning News. All six who died were passengers in the car. Victims: Kentron Haskin, Desedric Johnson, and Trey Woodberry (pic. from left to right), three high school football players who were all killed in a violent car crash Sunday evening in Dallas, Texas . Fatal accident: A look at the grisly scene of the single-car crash, which killed all six passengers . The sixth victim, a 20-year-old male who was driving the 2004 Chevrolet Impala at the time of the crash, has not been identified. Police say the driver lost control after the back passenger-side tire of the car hit a curb. The vehicle slid across three lanes before hitting a tree in the median. Four of the passengers were pronounced dead on the scene, while the other two died later in the hospital. The three teens who lost their lives all played football at Kimball High School in Oak Park, Texas. Woodberry and Haskin were freshmen, and Johnson a sophomore. Rhonda Woodberry, Trey's mother, described her son as 'friendly' and 'outgoing,' and said the 15-year-old had been nervous about meeting new friends at his high school. She added that while she knew Haskin and Johnson, she did not know the other three passengers in the car, or where they were going at the time of the crash. On Monday night, several hundred people gathered together for a candlelight vigil on Bonnie View Road, where the accident occurred. Mourning: A memorial to victims of the crash on Bonnie View Road in Dallas . 'They were good kids and seemed like they were going to be really good leaders,' Kimball football coach Carlton Nelson said of the three. He also spoke of how popular Johnson was with fellow players, always making people laugh and pulling pranks. 'We called him our little Warren Sapp,' said Nelson, referring to the football star and Hall of Famer who was also known as a jokester. 'He [Johnson] kept the other kids laughing and playing.'

"Three Lions supporters voted with their feet on Wednesday night with 50,000 empty seats at Wembley for England's friendly against Norway. And audience figures would suggest fans staged a protest with their television remote, too. While the BBC's The Great British Bake Off raked in over 8 million viewers, England's drab performance against Norway managed to pull in only half that number. Indeed just 4.5 million tuned in to watch Roy Hodgson's side record a slender 1-0 victory over Norway. VIDEO Scroll down for Roy Hodgson: Not many friendlies command a 40,000 attendance . Celebration: Wayne Rooney scored a second-half penalty as England recorded a slender win over Norway . Soggy display: Wednesday night's The Great British Bake Off attracted more viewers than England's win . Wayne Rooney scored a second-half penalty to ensure England claimed their first win in six games, but it was a largely dreary performance from Hodgson’s side. In their first game since the World Cup shambles, where England’s stay at the tournament lasted just two games, the brave 40,000 who turned up at Wembley would have been hoping for an improved display from England's alleged new era. But they were treated to a largely lifeless performance. The Football Association has accepted that it has work to do to regain supporters' trust after the disappointment of the World Cup, and has arranged high-profile friendlies against world champions Germany, Spain, Italy and France over the next two years to try to drum up interest, especially with a fairly hum-drum Euro 2016 qualifying group. Sitting comfortably: Mary Berry is a judge on the hit BBC programme which has gained a cult following . Empty seats: Only 40,000 supporters turned up to watch England face Norway in Wednesday's friendly . Football Association general secretary Alex Horne said last week: 'We have got some work to do, we have to rebuild a squad which is Roy Hodgson's department, and we have got to rebuild some trust with the supporters.' England played Norway with the top tier closed due to low ticket sales - a record low for an England game at the new Wembley but the attendance of 40,181 was slightly better than the FA had been fearing. The FA says it will be the best part of a decade before it can consider taking England games to other stadiums around the country as it needs the income from Wembley to pay off the stadium's debt.","Over 8 million people tuned in to watch The Great British Bake Off .

"When Ashley Young was a teenager trying to make his way through the Watford Academy, an emergency meeting was called at the club to discuss his future. Academy coaches fought for Young to be given a professional contract, others at the club felt he was too slight and small and had no future in the tough hard world of professional football. The academy coaches won, and Young has since commanded big money moves first from Watford to Aston Villa for almost £10million, and then on to Manchester United for up to £20m. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Young show off skills with Fellaini and United reject Nani . Waste of talent: Ashley Young's days at Old Trafford look numbered following a string of inconsistent performances and the arrival of £59m signing Angel Di Maria . No Angel for Young: The arrival of Di Maria from Real Madrid will likely spell the end of Young's time at United . Tainted reputation: Young collapses to the floor under the slightest of contact from Sunderland's Wes Brown . Going down: Young was booked for his elaborate tumble as United's penalty appeals were waved away . Young has done well from the game and at times – certainly at Villa – he has looked like a special talent. But in his three years at United he has convinced nobody that he is comfortable at that level. Worse than that he has a reputation as a diver, which might make those supportive academy coaches squirm after they backed him so much in his youth. And now record-breaking Angel di Maria is on his way to Old Trafford for a huge fee – that’s how desperate United are for quality out wide. Never mind Angel, Di Maria might as well be the Grim Reaper as far as Young is concerned. Propping up the bar at the last chance saloon at Sunderland on Sunday, Young had the opportunity to stake one last claim in front of Louis van Gaal. But as cross after cross went straight to an opposition player, time was surely called on Young’s big club adventure. Track record: Young sends himself sprawling to the ground under pressure from QPR's Shaun Derry in 2012 . Tumble: Young goes down in the box playing for England against Montenegro in a 2010 Euro qualifier . Not only can you question whether Young is good enough to be a wing-back under Van Gaal at United, you can ask if he is even good enough to be on the wing. If it is to be the end of Young’s time at Manchester United he will only be remembered as a diver. His England career already appears to be finished – he hasn’t played for almost a year for Roy Hodgson’s side. He will go down as one of many England players to have missed a penalty in a shootout at a tournament. Young nearly broke the crossbar from the spot in Kiev in Euro 2012. There are many examples of English players who have promised so much but ultimately delivered so little. Young is another. He was showcasing his talents superbly until he moved to Manchester United. Out of patience: Louis Van Gaal has given Young a chance to impress him but he hasn't taken it . At that point, his wages rocketed, and with Sir Alex Ferguson taking more of a back seat before retiring, there was less and less pressure to perform. The imagination and creativity he played with at Villa seemed to evaporate from his game, and frankly he now looks ordinary. Shame, especially after all the support he received when he was given so much support as a youth team player at Watford. Those coaches who believed in him back then will wonder where the hunger went. Unfortunately, Young is not the only English talent to hit a ceiling, and fail to break through it. He’s not the only one at United either. Like our Manchester United Facebook page here.","Arrival of Angel Di Maria will spell the end of Ashley Young's time at Manchester United .

"Some enterprising New Yorkers appear to have seized the occasion of Banksy's artist residency in the city to make a few bucks. Video and photos have emerged showing three men who've apparently taken over a corner where a Banksy piece was painted Thursday in East New York and they're charging $5 per viewing. With a just a flimsy piece of cardboard, the men have turned the activist street artists work into a peep show. Scroll down for video . No freebies: Some enterprising Brooklyn men decided to make a quick buck when a Banksy piece showed up in the East New York neighborhood . It's no Chelsea: Many of the eager art lovers showed up to see the Banksy, but left aghast that a man was charging for it . 'Chill out!' says one woman in a video from the scene taken by Instagram user capnyc. A man taking money from eager art lovers carrying cameras yells profanity at the woman as she apparently tries to explain that  Banksy's work is likely meant to be free. He tells his business partner to let a woman who has paid him take a picture. A piece of cardboard is moved away from a cement wall to reveal a beaver painted to look like it has felled a street sign. 'You want to take a picture, its gonna cost something,' the man, who appears to be the ringleader, says in another video. 'Or, the s**t can just get broke.' Leave it to Banksy: It's the latest piece from the British artist's month long street art residency he's dubbed Better Out Than In . Day 10: Banksy has said he intends to unveil a new piece for every day in October . 'It don't matter to me. Now what does it matter to you,' the man asked incredulous visitors as he threatened to smash the painting . Good deal? For each reveal, the men charged $5 . 'It don't matter to me,' he says. 'Now what does it matter to you?' When someone refuses to pay his fee, the man yells, 'Bye! That means you don't give a f**k about the artist!' The piece showed up in the Brooklyn neighborhood, known to be one of its most crime-riddled, on October 10. Banksy began painting and installing his pieces in New York on October 1 as part of a month-long artist's residency on the streets he's dubbed Better Out than In. On October 9, the British artist's work showed up on the Lower East Side. The work is Banksy's comment on the Iraq war and is a spray-painted car set in front of charging horses wearing night-vision goggles. The car is surrounded with oil barrels and Banksy has stenciled a number on the side of one. The phone number takes callers to a disturbing 39-minute recording of an airstrike in Baghdad that was released by Wikileaks in 2010. Eighteen people, including a Reuters photographer and two children, were killed in the strike. Whether he meant his little beaver to be a statement or not, it has become a one. A cultural rift is revealed as aghast art lovers walk away when a man from a tough side of Brooklyn demands their money to look at street graffiti in his neighborhood.","Some men in the tough Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York decided to charge admission when a Banksy piece showed up on their block .

"Apple has admitted its iCloud service was to blame for the theft of hundreds of celebrity pictures. The firm said it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and said they were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. It advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification. Scroll down for video . Apple's online system for resetting iCloud passwords has come under scrutiny for its part in the hacking case. Experts say worried consumers should turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account. The tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password. To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID.Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security. Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices. A trusted device is one that can receive 4-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone. 'Our customers’ privacy and security are of utmost importance to us,' it said in a statement. 'We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities. 'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple’s engineers to discover the source.' 'After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet.' None of the cases  resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone, the firm said. MailOnline revealed that Hackers could have gained access to celebrity iCloud accounts using just an email address and a search engine. Apple's password reset system for accounts has become the latest target in the hunt to find out how nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other celebrities' were leaked. 'We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.' The system allows people to reset a password by answering two security questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity users. The reset system allows those who have forgotten their password to reset it by answering a series of questions. Users are asked to first confirm their date of birth - which is straightforward to find online . They are then offered two options - to change their password using email authentication or by answering security questions . Hackers are believed to have used iCloud's password reset function to gain access to accounts. This allows users to reset their password by entering their username, date of birth and correctly answering two security questions. Experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities. Apple has admitted it is 'actively investigating' claims a flaw in the 'Find My iPhone' function of its iCloud service may have helped a hacker to steal the photos. Today it emerged hackers may also have used the service's password reset function to gain access to accounts. This allows users to reset their password by entering their username, date of birth and correctly answering two security questions. Experts say this information should be relatively easy to find for celebrities. Apple does email users to tell them their password has been changed. However, on the AnonIB hacking messageboard, those who say they have used the method claim that it's often best to reset the password at night so that the password reset email can be read and deleted before the target is awake. Rich Mogull, a security expert with Securosis, warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online. 'The key is not to put the real answers to these questions,' he told MailOnline. Users are then asked to answer two security questions, which range from their first car to their favourite job, which were set up when they signed up for the account. Mogull, who admitted hackers had tried to access his account, warned that it was still unclear exactly what happened. 'We don't know what happened yet, and In the security world, you need all the facts.' He also believed consumers were likely to stay with the firm despite the breaches. 'Historically we don't see a mass exodus from breaches, consumers don't seem to change their behaviour. 'There's a lot of historical precedent here - and this is just a first strike for Apple. 'It does appear that there was a flaw in iCloud - and we need to hear from Apple what the problem was, and what they are going to do to make it better,’ Experts believe the breadth of the celebrities affected could be down to a ‘chain effect’ - once one celebrities phonebook was accessed, it could lead to dozens more. Security consultant Graham Cluley told MailOnline: 'For these attacks to work, you also need email addresses of target. 'But what we have seen is that hackers can access address books - and this would have helped the hackers.' Clulely also believes the 'reset password' system may have been used. 'It certainly possible that people would have used this,' he said. 'In the case of celebrities, these secret questions are very easy to find online - either in Wikipedia or by searching through some interviews.' Dropbox requires users to respond to an email sent to their address to reset a password . Cluley said that anger was growing at Apple among iCloud users. ‘Even though we don’t know exactly what happened, the feeling is growing that Apple wasn't doing enough to stop this,' he said. However, Cluley believes customers will stick with Apple. ‘I don't think we'll see a mass exodus - people's memory are very short. Jeffifer Lawrence and model Cara Delevingne are among those hit by the leaks so far . 'Apple is about to announce a new iPhone, and people will use iCloud to move their data do it, because it’s such a simple process. The hacker claims he or she broke into stars' iCloud accounts, including those of the Hunger Games actress, Kate Upton and Rihanna, before publishing them on 4chan, the image-sharing forum. A list of the alleged victims of the hack - a staggering 101 in total - has also been posted online; most of whom have not seen any photographs leaked by the hacker. Cluley said he thought 'more leaks are to come'. Experts also think a flaw in Apple's Find my Phone was used for some of the hacks. However, despite not admitting the bug was caused by its system, the tech giant issued a 'patch', or fix, for the alleged 'Find My iPhone' bug some claim is responsible. Code on software development site Github called iBrute, would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. Apple has since issued a fix for the bug. 'The end of the fun, Apple has just patched,' read an update on the post.

"Andy Murray lost the match but did enough to remind why he has won Grand Slams in the past and might yet do so again in the future. At 1.17am, before the unruly remnants of the Flushing Meadows crowd, he finally succumbed to the barrage of Novak Djokovic in their US Open quarter final, going down 7-6 6-7 6-2, 6-4 in three hours and 31 minutes. By the end Murray's spirit was willing but the legs had weakened, as he paid the price for taking three and a half hours longer to get to this match than his opponent.

This result was not unexpected, but for sustained periods he stood toe-to-toe with the world’s best player, whose standards he must aspire to if he is to re-attain the success of 2012-13. Murray said afterwards: 'He was definitely physically fresher, the pace of my serve slowed down towards the end. My back towards the end stiffened up, it is physically extremely demanding to play him. I tried to hang in at the end but was a little bit disappointed how my body reacted, I have trained hard. 'There was some good stuff in the first two sets, I was down in them but I fought back, I just didn’t play a good first tiebreak.' Djokovic added: 'We both gave our best. At times the tennis was not that nice, we made a lot of unforced errors, but it was due to the very physical battle in the opening two and a half sets. 'I didn't expect any less knowing I was going to face Andy. The last five times we played, it was always over three or four hours. I'm very glad to get through to another semi-final.' Neither player was flawless but there were plenty of magnificent exchanges which frequently pushed the Serb to his limits. Djokovic, who now plays Kei Nishikori, will surely win this event now. There were ample unforced errors and both players went through sporadic lapses and, especially in Murray’s case, the return much outshone the serve. There was also much to admire. The Scot’s forehand was particularly potent, and he will contemplate what might have happened if he had avoided one of those lapses in the opening tiebreak. Murray fought hard into the early hours. Ultimately, however, Djokovic with his seven breaks of serve bossed proceedings and from the second tiebreak never looked like losing. Murray at least knows he has created something to build on.

Two years after their epic final in 2012, the former junior rivals were reunited on the same court at the Arthur Ashes Stadium, this time with one of them ranked as the world’s top player and the other the No 8 seed. Murray's lower than normal seed being the reason why they were now meeting in the last eight. That is not by accident, Murray is taking small steps on his way back from surgery while Djokovic has rediscovered the art of winning Grand Slams after a period of near misses. On a balmy night, the Arthur Ashe Stadium was packed to the gunwales and the 27-year-old Scot made the perfect start when his piercing returns resulted in an opening break. He was always likely to make inroads on the Djokovic serve but protecting his own was going to be the problem. He had dropped it thirteen times coming into this match and the fourteenth was not far behind as Djokovic immediately levelled. The inability to gain free points against someone who returns even better than he does saw him go 1-4 down - but the damage was swiftly repaired. The Serb, ever the rolled up ball of Balkan anger, started ranting at himself in the seventh game and was pressured into several errors to allow Murray back in. The Scot’s big chance came when be forced a break point at 4-4, but a finely angled serve meant he could only just lay a racket on it. Breather: Andy Murray looked to be feeling the pace during parts of the match on Wednesday . Plenty to ponder: Daniel Vallverdu and Amelie Mauresmo watch on as Andy Murray crashes out . Support: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was in attendance and roaring her man on . By the time the tiebreak came around they had won 45 points each, but Murray could not recover from a dismal start - he hit a double fault followed by a pedestrian 77 mph second serve that got the full treatment. The tiebreak was over in a blink of an eye, with the Serb taking it 7-1, and Djokovic looked to be in full control when a run of 12 out of 14 points saw him go 3-1 up, with Murray's net play notably more hesitant than in previous rounds. But again Murray’s superb returns meant he was not finished and after breaking back for 4-4 - the top seed rightly being given a time violation - he forced a set point at 6-5. But he could not get enough on the return, was forced back and his attempted lob was put away. The tiebreak was the inverse of the first, Murray far more purposeful and Djokovic ended up slapping errors in frustration by the end as he went down 7-1. Eyes on the prize: but Andy Murray ultimately fell short and crashed out of the tournament . Hand it to him: Novak Djokovic gestures to the umpire as a point goes against him . Full crowd: The Arthur Ashe stadium was nearly full as spectators stayed up for the main game . While there were frequent mistakes on both sides, Djokovic stayed strong to stem any momentum and broke for 3-1 in the third before holding off two break points when his opponent pulled the trigger too early in draining exchanges. There was a devil-may-care attitude about Murray for the rest of the set as he focussed on energy conservation. Murray began this tournament cramping against Robin Haase and ended it in a similar state, his body creaking at the end as he sought to hold in the fourth. He had a break point at the start but the body language sagged and he could not seriously threaten after that. The break of serve to seal it came entirely on cue.","Murray loses 7-6, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 to world No 1 Djokovic .

"Joan Rivers may have been given the same drug that killed Michael Jackson when she went into cardiac and respiratory arrest at a New York clinic, it has been sensationally claimed today. The 81-year-old comedy legend slipped into a coma and never regained consciousness after being sedated for an endoscopy procedure. She died this afternoon. The New York State Department of health has launched an investigation into Yorkville Endoscopy, the out-patient  clinic where Rivers went into arrest. The clinic has said it is cooperating fully. RadarOnline reports that Rivers was given Propofol, which is often used was an anesthetic for simple medical procedures. Scroll down for video . Entertaining to the end: Joan Rivers had her hair and makeup done daily after she slipped into a coma following a routine surgery at a New York City clinic . It is the same drug that gained infamy after it was revealed that the King of Pop died after taking a cocktail of drugs that included Propofol. In the days before her death, she reportedly had her hair and makeup done every day - a testament to the consummate performer's desire to always look her best, the New York Daily News reports. Her suit at Mount Sinai Hospital was filled with decoration and flowers in an effort to make her comfortable in her last moments, the newspaper reports. New York Post's gossip columnist and Rivers' self-proclaimed ‘forever friend’ Cindy Adams reported Thursday that Joan has been transferred to a larger suite decorated with flowers, plants and bows by celebrity event planner Preston Bailey, who had organized Melissa Rivers' wedding years earlier. Adams, who was spotted leaving the Manhattan medical center after visiting her friend earlier this week, also said that Rivers lies covered with a white faux mink blanket from designer Dennis Basso's collection and has a CD of the musical Oklahoma! playing in the room, according to Hollywood Life. Adams dished about Joan Rivers' upgraded hospital stay, which includes a team of makeup artists, hairdressers and manicurists swarming around her to make sure the legendary fashionista looks her best. According to the columnist, her nails are painted deep purple and white, and her toenails are green. Hospital staff even allow Rivers' dogs, a Japanese Chin named Teegan and a Havanese, to be brought into her room so they could give their 'mommy' a kiss. Dog lover: Hospital staff allow Rivers' two dogs, including Teegan the Japanese Chin (pictured) to visit her . Ms Rivers was rushed to Mount Sinai a week ago after going into cardiac arrest during an outpatient procedure on her vocal chords. On Thursday, TMZ reported that the New York state Department of Health is now looking into Yorkville Endoscopy - the clinic where Rivers had the ill-fate surgery. State officials said they are reviewing the case, but have yet to launch an official investigation. Spokesman James O'Hare said Thursday that the department is looking into 'the whole matter.' He declined to discuss specifics. Also today E! network announced that Ms Rivers' weekly Fashion Police series has been put on hiatus in the wake of her hospitalization. The long-running program, which normally airs fresh episodes on Fridays, is on break this week and next, the network stated, 'as we await Joan and Melissa's return in front and behind the camera.' Rivers' daughter, Melissa Rivers, is its executive producer. In its place, the network plans to air two special programs focusing on New York Fashion Week. Melissa Rivers released a statement Wednesday saying that her mother is being 'kept comfortable' after being moved from ICU into a private room. In style: Rivers' hospital suite has been decorated with flowers, bows and plants by celebrity event planner Preston Bailey (left) Shelved: E! network announced that Joan Rivers' show Fashion Police has been put on hiatus . She made no reference to whether or not her mother's condition has improved. Rivers suffered cardiac arrest and stopped breathing during minor throat surgery on her vocal chords at a New York City hospital last Thursday. She was left fighting for her life amid fears she might be left a 'vegetable', but friends have since dismissed these claims and said she is improving day by day at Mount Sinai Hospital. Her daughter flew from Los Angeles following the incident and has remained at her bedside. The comedy stalwart had reportedly laughed about undergoing 'a little procedure' ahead of her operation. Under scrutiny: New York state health officials are now looking into Yorkville Endoscopy, the clinic where Rivers underwent the ill-fated procedure on her vocal cords last week . Medical care: Rivers has been at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan since last Thursday . Worried: Rivers' daughter Melissa has been by her mother's bedside since the beginning of her health crisis . Her friend Jay Redack, who was turned away by security when he tried to visit her in hospital, was one of the last people to spend time with her and said she was in good spirits before the surgery. They had enjoyed dinner on Wednesday night after her hour-long stand-up session at the Laurie Beechman Theatre in Times Square. 'She said her throat was bothering her for a long time,' he told the New York Daily News. 'Her voice was getting more raspy, if that was possible. She said she was just going in for a little procedure in the morning, that was it.'

"A 54 second video of Jessica Findlay Brown appeared on the first page of the Google search . Google was drawn into the celebrity nude hacking scandal yesterday after it helped direct internet users to a British actress’s sex tape. The search giant was criticised after a link to an explicit video apparently featuring Jessica Brown Findlay appeared on the first page of searches for the star. The 24-year-old, who played Lady Sybil in ITV’s Downton Abbey, is understood to be distraught after three clips of her naked were apparently stolen from her Apple iCloud account. The videos have now been viewed more than a million times online. Last night, in the face of mounting pressure, Google finally took action – but only after one 54-second video had been available via its search engine for at least eight hours. A Google spokesman said: ‘Searches for “Jessica Brown Findlay” no longer deliver the video on the front page, which should limit its exposure.’ And in a separate move last night, the website that had hosted the video posted a message saying: ‘This video has been suspended either due to a copyright claim, or for breaching the terms of use.’ The Downton Abbey star is one of around 100 female celebrities on a ‘target list’ by anonymous hackers who have stolen dozens of intimate pictures and videos and put them online. Apple confirmed that some celebrity iCloud accounts had been deliberately targeted and hacked. Last night it said none of the cases it had so far investigated were a result of bugs in its iCloud or Find my iPhone systems, but were a result of a ‘very targeted attack’ on the security procedures of celebrity accounts. It insisted there had not been a general security breach. A spokesman said: ‘After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the internet. ‘None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone. ‘We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.’ The videos emerged three days ago on niche Internet forums and spread to the mainstream web thanks in part to Google and other websites. The FBI is investigating the leak, which had left stars – including actress Jennifer Lawrence, 24, and model Kate Upton, 22 – powerless to stop the images of them in various stages of undress spreading around the web and being watched millions of times. A spokesman for Miss Brown Findlay said she is treating it as a ‘criminal matter’. Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture committee, was among those who had called yesterday for Google to stop directing search engine users to the 54-second video, which had been watched 573,050 times by yesterday afternoon. Links to other versions of the same video and to others were shared on a social media website and on a pornography website, gaining at least another 600,000 viewings. Scroll down for video . Jessica plays Lady Sybil Crawley (centre) in hit ITV series Downton Abbey alongside Laura Carmichael (left) who plays Lady Edith Crawley and Michelle Dockery (right) who plays Lady Mary Crawley . Mr Whittingdale said of Google: ‘They have already acknowledged they have responsibility for removing links to child pornography and criminal websites. This material appears to have been obtained illegally and should be treated in the same way.’ Google is currently classed as an ‘aggregator’ rather than a ‘publisher’ of material, so it cannot be sued for providing links to offensive material. British stars Michelle Keegan, 27, Cat Deeley, 37, Cara Delevingne, 22, and Kelly Brook, 34, were also on the hackers’ ‘target list’, although no stolen photos had emerged. Jennifer Lawrence (left) and Kate Upton (right) are among the celebrities whose images were leaked online . Michelle Keegan, 27, (left) and Cat Deeley, 37, (right) were also on the hackers’ ‘target list’ but had none stolen . 24-year-old actress Emma Watson took to Twitter to criticise those who had looked at the images online . Actress Emma Watson criticised those who had looked at the images online, tweeting: ‘Even worse than seeing women’s privacy violated on social media is reading the accompanying comments that show such a lack of empathy.’ She spoke out amid fury over comedian Ricky Gervais who tweeted: ‘Celebrities, make it harder for hackers to get nude pics of you from your computer by not putting nude pics of yourself on the computer.’ He quickly deleted the post, as some readers accused him of ‘blaming the violation of a woman’s body on her’. The leaking of nude celebrity photos online has come – in a remarkable coincidence – just as a new film highlights similar concerns about storing intimate data on computers. In the comedy Sex Tape, released in the UK today, Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel star as a married couple who film themselves having sex but accidentally share the video with friends and family through Apple’s iCloud service. Experts believe the intimate images of celebrities put online this week were obtained by hackers breaking into their internet iCloud accounts, where photos from iPhones can be stored. In Sex Tape, the son of the couple’s neighbours threatens to leak their video to a pornography website unless they pay a ransom. Material on iCloud can be seen only with a password, but the husband in the film mirrors public confusion about the technology when he says: ‘Nobody understands the cloud. It’s a mystery.’","Jessica Brown Findlay, 24, played Lady Sybil in ITV series Downton Abbey .

"A young French mother whose two-year-old daughter was smuggled out of the country by her father and reportedly taken to jihadist centres in Syria arrived home Wednesday after they were reunited in Turkey. Meriam Rhaiem, 25, made headlines in March with an emotional appeal to French authorities to recognise her baby girl as 'the youngest French hostage'. Mother and daughter arrived at Villacoublay air base outside Paris at 2:15am Wednesday (00:15 GMT) aboard a plane chartered by the French interior ministry. Home at last: Meriam Rhaiem steps off a plane at an air base outside Paris with her baby girl, Assia, after she was smuggled out of the country by her father . 'It's a moment of great emotion with the arrival of Meriam Rhaiem and her daughter Assia, after months of waiting,' said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who went out onto the tarmac to meet the plane. He noted 'the trials this young woman has endured, fighting hard for the return of her daughter who was kidnapped in circumstances which aren't clear.' He thanked the Turkish authorities for their role in the family reunion which led to 'the best possible outcome'. Rhaiem, holding her child in a beige blanket and flanked by her lawyer who was also on the plane from Turkey, made no comment upon her arrival. Relief: French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve (left) welcomes Mrs Rhaiem upon her arrival in Paris with her daughter . Rhaiem, who lives in eastern France, had said she was certain her French husband, whom she is divorcing, and who is wanted under an international arrest warrant, was in Syria where he was seeking to join jihadists. The father was arrested last weekend with their 28-month-old daughter Assia in Turkey, where he is still being held, a French interior ministry source said. Assia's father had failed to bring his daughter home after spending the day with her in October last year, and had left France by road bound for Turkey, from where he called his wife regularly and asked her to come and join them. He had also said he planned to cross into Syria with their daughter to join the Al-Nusra Front, which is Al-Qaeda's official Syrian affiliate. Joy: Mrs Rhaiem walks across the tarmac with her baby in her arms . Cazeneuve told French radio on Wednesday that the father 'had taken this child into the theatre of jihadist operations in Syria', adding she was 'in danger every day.' He paid tribute to 'a brave mother (who) decided to get her child back.' According to Rhaiem's lawyer Gabriel Versini-Bullara, her husband had become radicalised after travelling to Mecca, asking her to wear the veil, criticising her for working or banning her from playing music to Assia. Like a number of European countries, France has expressed concern over radicalised people leaving the country to fight in Iraq and Syria, with fears that they could pose a risk to domestic security on their return. According to official estimates, around 800 French nationals or residents - including several dozen women - have travelled to Syria, returned from the conflict-ridden country or plan to go there. France unveiled a bill in July aimed at stopping aspiring jihadists from travelling to Syria. It includes a ban on foreign travel of up to six months for individuals suspected of radicalisation, and gives authorities powers to temporarily confiscate and invalidate their passports.","Meriam Rhaiem's baby was smuggled out of France by her father in March .

"Angel Di Maria is set to be left out of Real Madrid's squad to face city rivals Atletico on Friday, giving further encouragement to Manchester United who are weighing up a £50million  bid for the Argentina World Cup star. Real contest their second trophy of the season  as they play the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico with the score 1-1 from the first game. But there is likely to be no Di Maria after tensions between the player and the European champions heightened in the last 24 hours. Out in the cold: Angel Di Maria is set to be left out of Real Madrid's Spanish Super Cup tie against Atletico . Top talent: Di Maria (right) came on as a substitute in the Spanish Super Cup first leg on Tuesday . Real  supporters have left the club in no doubt that they want Di Maria to stay at the club but president Florentino Perez wants him sold to help the club balance the books after their £95m spending spree this summer bringing in Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez. The club were embarrassed by the reaction of the Bernabeu on Tuesday when Di Maria came on as a second half substitute and was given a huge ovation by supporters. On Thursday coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed the player had turned down the offer of a new contract and asked for a move. But Di Maria's new deal would only have seen him bring £4m next year and he wants parity with those who are in the second tier of Real's wage structure and earn £6m  net a season. International pedigree: Di Maria played a pivotal role for Argentina as they reached the 2014 World Cup final . Supporters who saw him play a huge role in the Champions League success last season believe he is worth it but the club have made no second offer and he will be a United player if they find the money to meet both Real's asking price and the player's wage demands. Catalan paper Sport suggests Barcelona have made a £48m  bid for Di Maria but  midfielder Xavi has dismissed the idea. The Nou Camp talisman believes the idea of Di Maria switching between Spain's big two clubs, just like Luis Figo did in swapping Barcelona for Real in 2000, just wouldn't happen. Controversial switch: Luis Figo moved from Barcelona to Real Madrid in 2000 . 'He's a great player but it is very rare that that happens,' Xavi said. A fans' poll on Sport's website revealed 80 percent of Barca fans wanting the unlikely swoop to take place and Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said on Tuesday that he is 'Real Madrid's best player'. It seems everyone bar the Real board want the Argentina star. What remains to be seen is if United want him enough and can persuade him to give up Champions League football for a season.

"If you've ever looked in awe at smart skin being developed for robots, don't worry - your own is far more intelligent. Neurons in human skin perform advanced calculations scientists previously believed only the brain could carry out, it has been revealed.

Skin is far more sensitive than we thought, and transmits more information than researchers had previously thought. Our touch experiences are already processed by neurons in the skin before they reach the brain for further processing. Researchers found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain. Previously, it has been thought that far more basic information was sent. This is according to a study from Umeå University in Sweden published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. It found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain. According to researchers at the Department of Integrative Medical Biology, IMB, Umeå University, this branching allows first-order tactile neurons not only to send signals to the brain that something has touched the skin, but also process geometric data about the object touching the skin. 'Our work has shown that two types of first-order tactile neurons that supply the sensitive skin at our fingertips not only signal information about when and how intensely an object is touched, but also information about the touched object's shape,' said Andrew Pruszynski, who is one of the researchers behind the study. Researchers found that the skin actually calculates geometric data itself before sending signals to the brain. The study also shows that the sensitivity of individual neurons to the shape of an object depends on the layout of the neuron’s highly-sensitive zones in the skin. 'Perhaps the most surprising result of our study is that these peripheral neurons, which are engaged when a fingertip examines an object, perform the same type of calculations done by neurons in the cerebral cortex,' Pruszynski said. 'Somewhat simplified, it means that our touch experiences are already processed by neurons in the skin before they reach the brain for further processing/'","Swedish team find skin processes touch information before sending it to brain .

"Apple has signed up Visa, Mastercard and American Express to its new payments system set to be unveiled next week, it has been claimed. The iPhone 6 will include a new payments system allowing owners to pay in stores simply by tapping their phone on a reader, it has been claimed. Now it has emerged the tech giant has signed up the major card firms to back the project. Scroll down for video . Put away the credit card! Apple is believed to be working on an iWallet app to allow users to easily pay with their phone . The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. Called Near Field Communication (NFC), the technology is already widely used by credit cards for low cost payments. Apple is expected to link the system to its iTunes store, which already holds customer's payment details. According to a source quoted by Bloomberg, 'The agreement includes Visa Inc., MasterCard Inc. and American Express Co. and will be unveiled on Sept. 9 along with the next iPhone.' 'The new iPhone will make mobile payment easier by including a near-field communication chip for the first time', the person told the firm. According to tech blog The Information, 'conversations between Apple and payments-industry companies have heated up in recent months.' It claims 'several people briefed on the talks say that Apple executives have discussed launching a mobile 'wallet' as soon as this fall for people to use their iPhones to pay for goods in physical stores.' According to the report, new phones will include a ‘secure element’ to store such sensitive data. Apple has also made hires relating to 'building a business around the hundreds of millions of credit cards it already has on file,' according to Wired, claims a source has told uit the solution will include NFC. Apple's cryptic invite for it's September 9th event, which is expected to see the iPhone 6 and iWatch unveiled. The service will also run without any intervention by mobile phone firms. Apple has told some partners its system would involve a so-called secured element in the phones—a piece of hardware where sensitive information such as a phone owner’s financial credentials can be stored. This expected to be the same secure system currently used to store fingerprint information, which is also set to store health data. Earlier this month Visa launched a new service called Visa Checkout that eliminates a few steps in online payment. The company and its retailing partners, including Neiman Marcus, Pizza Hut, Staples and others, hope a quicker payout will lead to fewer abandoned shopping carts online. With the iPhone 6 launch two weeks away,  new images of leaked parts have been revealed on a near daily basis. Multiple images of both the front panel and the rear shell of the 4.7-inch device have surfaced, while this image seemingly shows the design of the entire device . As more customers shop on smaller screens like smartphones and tablets, the hassle of entering in credit card numbers and billing addresses is becoming a sticking point and payment processors have been working to find ways to simplify the process. Visa Checkout joins similar services like eBay's PayPal, MasterCard's MasterPass, Amazon's one-click checkout and others. Visa has been working to expand its reach into the payments processing business with new products like Visa Checkout. The company is also opening a technology center in San Francisco in an effort to court mobile developers in the Bay Area tech community. It plans to hire 100 new technology staffers for the center.","Could be linked to iTunes store accounts .

"Do you struggle to keep your toes cosy in wintery weather? Now there’s an inconspicuous interactive insole that heats your feet and can be controlled using a smartphone app. Digitsole devices slip inside shoes and will allow wears to adjust the temperature of the insoles at the touch of a button, as well as count steps and calories burned, when they go on sale. Scroll down for video . Appy feet! Digitsole insoles (pictured) slip inside shoes connect to an app. They will allow wears to adjust the temperature at the touch of a button, as well as count steps and calories burned, when they go on sale . Charge the insoles via the built-in USB port. Switch the on/off button on the back of the insole, launch the app and connect it to your smartphone using Bluetooth. Select the warmth function on the app and adjust the temperature of each insole by sliding the bar up and down. You can track how many steps you take during the day as well as the altitude. The app also counts how many calories have been burned. The company, based in Nancy, France, claims its lightweight insole is the first wholly connected design of its type and fits into most types of shoes. The heating element of the insole is a secret, but the company told MailOnline that it's located in the toe and that the specially-engineered fabric spreads the heat throughout the sole. Digitsoles are made from a lightweight material called Neotech. They will be charged using a USB port and will connect to an Android and iOS app via Bluetooth 4.0. Once connected, a user will be able to access the ‘warm up function’ on the app. There, they will adjust the temperature of each insole separately by sliding a bar on the screen up and down. Getting warmer: Once connected, a user will be able to access the ‘warm up function’ on the app to adjust the temperature of each insole separately, by sliding a bar on the screen up and down (pictured) Not so shocking: The insoles have a ‘shock heel system’ (pictured) to help with general posture and foot health, the company claims. They are made from a lightweight material called Neotech . Weight: 3.5 ounces (100 grams) Measurements: Half an inch (1.3cm) thick at the heel and less than 0.25 inches (0.5cm) at the toe . Materials: Neotech and Poron . Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 . Maximum heat: 40°C (104°F) Heat regulation: Thermostat . Distance measurements: Miles or metres . Battery life: Seven to eight hours, recharged via twin USB chargers . Sizes: 36 to 46 . Cost: $99 (£78) ‘This unique independent adjustment allows you to get the perfect temperature setting for each of your feet,’ the company says on its Kickstarter page, where it is looking for funds to put the insoles into production. Once the temperature of an insole drops below the chosen setting, a built-in thermostat adjusts it to maintain the temperature. The insoles have sensors inside to provide precise tracking, which their creators say are more accurate than exercise wristbands. Users can enter their weight and height when they first log in to the app to keep track of how many calories they burn and how many steps they take while using Digitsoles. The insoles have a ‘shock heel system’ to help with general posture and foot health, the company claims. This consists of a cushion section placed at the back of the insole to soften shock and spread vibrations of the foot, and a ‘flex zone section’ at the front of the insole to encourage natural movement of feet and provide arch support. The insoles are available to pre-order on crowd funding website Kickstarter, from $99 (£60) and are expected to be shipped in December. Multipurpose: Users can choose how warm to make their insoles using the 'warm the feet' function of the app (pictured left), track how many steps they have taken and metres walked (pictured centre) and document how many calories they have burned while wearing the insoles . Flexible: Digitsole has been designed to be thin, comfortable and easy to place in most shoe types so you only need one pair. 'The insoles can be used in just about any shoe...so you can enjoy warm feet whatever you’re doing,' the company said . Good to go: The insoles, which will be sold for $99 on Kickstarter, can be charged by using a built in USB-port .","Digitsole devices slip inside different kinds of shoes and are rechargeable .

"On the run: Snowden has been on the run from U.S. authorities since he laid bare the extent of the NSA's spying programme, particularly on internet communication, such as emails, and social media . Islamic State extremists have studied and exploited the leaks made by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden to operate under the radar of U.S. intelligence, a former agency chief has claimed. Chris Inglis said militants in Iraq and Syria are 'clearly' harder to track down since the rogue agent made freely available a wealth of top-secret information  about how the U.S. government hunts its enemies online. The terror group, Inglis said, has drastically altered its evasive tradecraft as a result of the data spill, and now operates only in the darkest corners of the internet, where they  remain one step ahead of the intelligence community. Inglis, who was the National Security Agency's deputy director when Snowden exposed how the NSA eavesdrops, said the leak 'went way beyond disclosing things that bore on privacy concerns', and delved deep into the agency's 'means and methods' used to stay on terrorists' tails. He told the Washington Times: 'Having disclosed all of those methods, or at least some degree of those methods, it would be impossible to imagine that - as intelligent as they are in the use of technology, in the employment of communications for their own purposes - they wouldn't understand how they might be at risk to intelligence services around the world, not the least of which is the U.S. And they necessarily do what they think is in their best interest to defend themselves.' Snowden has been on the run from U.S. authorities since he laid bare the extent of the NSA's spying programme, with particular regard to internet communication, such as emails, and social media. Thanks to the Snowden spill, terror groups have become far more internet savvy, expertly employing the web to disseminate propaganda and communicating only through the most clandestine of channels. Thanks to Snowden's leaks, the terror group has drastically altered its evasive tradecraft, operating only from the darkest corners of the internet, one step ahead of the intelligence community . Evil: Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a bin Laden devotee from Iraq, is known to have a sophisticated understanding of online evasive tactics, doubtless improved by Snowden's disclosures . Matthew G. Olsen, who directs the National Counterterrorism Center, agreed, adding: 'Following the disclosure of the stolen NSA documents, terrorists are changing how they communicate to avoid surveillance. 'They are moving to more secure communications platforms, using encryption and avoiding electronic communications altogether . 'This is a problem for us in many areas where we have limited human collection and depend on intercepted communications to identify and disrupt plots.' Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, a bin Laden devotee from Iraq, is known to have a sophisticated understanding of online evasive tactics, doubtless improved by Snowden's disclosures. The Washington Post highlighted one example of how the leaks exposed the types of communications that should be avoided to evade capture. One of Snowden's disclosures revealed how America caught and killed Osama bin Laden confidant Hassan Ghul in October 2012 after spies intercepted an email from his wife describing his whereabouts. 'In Ghul's case, the agency deployed an arsenal of cyberespionage tools, secretly seizing control of laptops, siphoning audio files and other messages and tracking radio transmissions to determine where Ghul might 'bed down,' The Post wrote. A Senate defense committee staffer said Thursday: “Our lax security has provided our adversaries with a gold mine of information about our tactics and procedures.”","Chris Inglis, NSA deputy chief during leaks, says IS 'clearly' harder to find .
