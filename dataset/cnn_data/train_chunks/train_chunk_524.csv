The deal would leave a typical borrower with a £150,000 mortgage £2,300 a year better off than the average two-year fixed rate of 4.44 per cent. Peter Gettins, of broker London & Country, said: ‘If you are looking for a mortgage this is an absolute cracker. Taking it out is a no-brainer. Hopefully, other lenders will try to match it.’ Bargain: Britain's cheapest mortgage will be launched today by Tesco at a rate of just 1.99 per cent . The Tesco Bank deal is fixed for two years and requires a 40 per cent deposit and carries a fee of £995. Tesco will throw in a free valuation and legal fees and borrowers with a Clubcard will receive one point for every £4 they spend on repayments. The next cheapest two-year fixed-rate loan of its type is with   Santander, at 2.39 per cent and a £1,995 fee. Last year, Leeds Building Society also offered a fixed rate of 1.99 per cent. However, its fee was £1,999. Under the Tesco deal, and with the average property price of £163,376, buyers would have to find a £65,350 deposit. However, experts said the rate would spark a price war among rival banks. Tesco said it could offer the . rock-bottom deal because of the Government’s Funding for Lending scheme . which aims to kick-start the economy and end a mortgage famine by . handing out £80billion to Britain’s banks. Deal: Tesco will also throw in a free valuation and legal fees and borrowers with a Clubcard will receive one point for every £4 they spend on repayments . But critics said Tesco should be using the cash to do more for borrowers with small deposits. Yesterday, figures from the Council of . Mortgage Lenders released showed the value of home loans approved in . September was 15 per cent lower than at the same time in 2011. Figures from the Yorkshire Building Society showed that first-time buyers must scrimp and save for eight years to raise the average £26,000 deposit needed for a first home. Aaron Strutt, of brokers Trinity Financial, said: ‘It seems a shame Tesco isn’t using the Funding for Lending money to offer help to people who really need it – those with small deposits.’ Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, said: ‘I am delighted we are able to offer these market-leading rates.’","The deal would leave a typical borrower .

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 12:50 EST, 14 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:17 EST, 14 October 2012 . Mystery: French Alps murder victim Saad al-Hilli was pictured smiling just 33 minutes before he was gunned down . The British family who died in a hail of bullets in the Alps was pictured ‘smiling and relaxed’ just 33 minutes before they were found dead. The time sequence was revealed six weeks after the Al-Hillis, from Claygate, Surrey, were killed on September 5 close to Lake Annecy, in France. French investigators have a picture taken by the family in the village of Arnand, near to the murder site, at 3.15pm that day. Eric Maillaud, the town’s prosecutor, said it could be a vital insight into how and why they came to die on September 5. Engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, were all found dead in the family BMW. All died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire which also killed 45-year-old cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a French father-of-three who was hit by at least five bullets. The Al-Hilli’s four-year-old daughter, Zeena, survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother’s corpse, while her sister, Zainab, seven, was badly injured. Mr Maillaud said that a few minutes before their car had pulled up outside a house in the nearby village of Arnand, where they posed for the pictures. Images retrieved in the BMW show ‘a real family photograph’, said Mr Maillaud. ‘Both women were smiling and did not seem worried. This suggests that everyone was relaxed at the time.’ But it is the timing of the pictures which is of particular interest to Mr Maillaud and two investigating French judges working with British detectives. Brett Martin, a 53-year-old Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle. He has described how he gave first aid to Zainab, who had been shot in the shoulder and beaten savagely around the head. Mr Martin said he also checked the pulse of Mr Mollier, turned off the BMW’s engine, and carried out a number of other tasks before realising his mobile phone did not have a signal. He then cycled down the hill, away from the crime scene, and finally made a call to the emergency services logged at 15.48. Scene: Aerial photo of the car at the murder scene in the forrest near Chevaline and Lake Annecy in the French Alps . This would have meant a window of far less than 33 minutes for the killer – or killers – to end the lives of four people, attack a child, and disappear without trace through one of the most popular tourist regions in eastern France. Detectives have been showing the photographs to villagers in the area but have refused to release them to the general public because, said one police officer, they are considered ‘morbid’. It follows criticism that they are making little progress in the investigation, after only opening a witness hotline last week, and interviewing a relatively small 650 people on an investigation spanning at least six countries. Not a single suspect has been found in all that time, with sightings of potential killers few and far between. Mr Maillaud today renewed his appeal for the driver of a green 4x4 vehicle seen speeding towards the scene by Mr Martin to come forward, suggesting the car might have belonged to the national forestry office, the ONF. But Mr Maillaid added: ‘It’s a theory but there is no certainty.’ The prosecutor said that there was particular interest in a bank account in the nearby Swiss city of Geneva in Mr Al-Hilli’s name. Believed to contain around three-quarters-of-a-million pounds, it is thought to be linked to a family will which Mr Al-Hilli and his brother, Zaid, were arguing about. As well as the family feud, Mr Maillaud said the enquiry was concentrating on Mr Al-Hilli’s work on satellite systems, and his past life in Iraq, where he was born.","Saad Al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and Swedish mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf all found dead in family BMW .

A pub league football referee was bludgeoned to death after he ruled a goal was offside during a friendly match in Zimbabwe. Isaac Mbofana, 34, died on the spot after a fan battered him around the head with a log during the heated game last week. The country’s Chronicle newspaper reported that Mr Mbofana had been running the line as an assistant referee when he ruled a goal was disallowed during the social match on a primary school playing field. Off the ball: Assistant referee Isaac Mbofana, 34, died after a fan battered him around the head with a log during a heated amateur football game in the village of Takawira in central Zimbabwe last week (file picture) Police said a group of local fans reacted angrily to the decision, with one allegedly picking up part of a tree trunk and attacking the linesman by the pitch side. Spokeswoman Thandiwe Khumalo confirmed officers had launched a murder probe following the incident, which happened last Thursday in the central village of Takawira. She said: 'It is alleged that on the said date there was a soccer tournament at Jomboringo Primary School. 'The teams clashed at about 3pm and the now deceased Mbofana was an assistant referee in that match.' The Chronicle reported that officers have named a local man Onismo Sichani, 31, as the main suspect in the murder. The government-controlled publication reported: 'Sgt Khumalo said during the course of the game, Sichani’s team scored a goal and Mbofana disallowed the goal arguing that it had been scored from an offside position. 'She said the ruling did not go down well with Sichani who then confronted Mbofana.' The officer confirmed detectives were hunting Sichani, who allegedly fled following the bloody attack. She said: 'A misunderstanding ensued between the two resulting in Sichani picking up a log, which he used to strike Mbofana once on the head. 'Mbofana fell down and died instantly. After realising that Mbofana was dead, Sichani fled from the scene. 'The matter was reported to the police who attended the scene and the body of the deceased was taken to Gokwe South District Hospital mortuary for a post-mortem.' Sergeant Khumalo urged members of the local community to come forward if they had information on the suspect’s whereabouts. She added: 'Police are appealing to members of the public with information, which might lead to the arrest of Onismo Sichani to contact their nearest police station or use our suggestion boxes.' The officer, who is acting spokesperson for Zimbabwe’s Midlands force, said people should not resort to violence during disputes. She said: 'We urge members of the public to always seek assistance from third parties in settling disputes to avoid such incidences.'","Isaac Mbofana, 34, died after a fan battered him around the head with a log during the heated game last week ."
"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 13:58 EST, 11 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:51 EST, 11 October 2012 . A  Republican politician personally endorsed by vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan is today at the centre of a storm after a controversial interview emerged in which he relayed his father's advice that 'some girls rape easy.' Desperately trying to control the damage, Wisconsin state Rep. Roger Rivard, claimed that repeating his father's comments were meant as a warning that a woman could agree to . sex but then later claim it wasn't consensual. However, the . backlash has been severe, with Republican vice . presidential candidate Paul Ryan announcing today he was withdrawing . his support for the embattled representative who is running for re-election. Republican state Rep. Roger Rivard said his comments relaying advice his father gave him that 'some girls rape easy' have been taken out of context . Rivard, 60, who is married with six adult children, including four daughters and nine grand-children . was first quoted making his rape comments in a December story published . by the Chetek Alert. He was discussing the case of Dennis Veldman, a 17-year-old high . school senior who was charged with sexual assault in Wisconsin for having sex with an . underage girl in the school's band room. But yesterday Rivard told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the original article did not provide the full . context of his father's comments and that his exact words were . different. 'He also told me one thing, 'If you do (have . premarital sex), just remember, consensual sex can turn into rape in an . awful hurry,' said Rivard to the Journal Sentinel. Republican state Rep. Roger Rivard had enjoyed the backing of vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan until today . 'Because all of a . sudden a young lady gets pregnant and the parents are madder than a wet . hen and she's not going to say, 'Oh, yeah, I was part of the program.' 'All that she has to say or the parents have to say is it was rape . because she's underage. And he just said, 'Remember, Roger, if you go . down that road, some girls,' he said, 'they rape so easy.' However, today on the eve of his . debate with Vice President Joe Biden,  Republican vice-presidential . candidate Paul Ryan withdrew his support for Rivard in the wake of his . rape comments. 'State . Representative Rivard's comments are outrageous and offensive,' Ryan's . congressional campaign spokesman Kevin Siefert said in a statement. 'Congressman Ryan believes there is no place in our discourse for rhetoric such as this. 'Congressman Ryan cannot support Mr. Rivard or his indefensible comments.' Rivard's Democratic opponent Stephen Smith called the comments offensive. 'I'm . offended to think that my sister or my daughters would be thought of in . that manner,' said Smith. 'I feel Roger is out of touch with the . majority of voters and his views are extreme.' Rivard claimed that he was trying to reference the fact that in Wisconsin the age of consent is 18 years old for couples who are not married. It is illegal to have sex with someone under age 18 in Wisconsin, and that has caused controversy at times when two teenagers are involved in a sexual relationship. Some in the state have argued for a so-called 'Romeo and Juliet' legislation that would reduce or eliminate penalties for minors close in age who have sex, but Rivard has never specifically endorsed such legislation. Three hours after he gave what he assumed was a clarification of his rape comments, Rivard contacted the Journal Sentinel to try to smooth over what he said with a statement in which he called rape a horrible act of . violence that unfortunately often goes unreported to police. The Republican politician Roger Rivard has caused a storm reminiscent to the one created by Todd Akin who made condemned comments about legitimate rape and women's bodies in August . 'Sexual assault is a crime that unfortunately is misunderstood and my . comments have the potential to be misunderstood as well,' his statement . said. 'Rape is a horrible act of violence. Sexual assault unfortunately . often goes unreported to police. 'I have four daughters and three . granddaughters and I understand the importance of making sure that . awareness of this crime is taken very seriously.' Rivards original comments were made 10-months ago in December but have resurfaced during the Republican's tight race in Wisconsin against Democrat Stephen Smith. Smith claims that he did not know of the comments until August around the time that U.S. Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri caused a national outrage for claiming that women's bodies could prevent pregnancy in cases of 'legitimate rape.' Akin, a nominee for Senate in Missouri, told the Jaco Report that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant . after being raped because the 'female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down'. 'First of all, from what I understand from doctors, (pregnancy from rape) is really rare,' the GOP stalwart told KTVI-TV. 'If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' He . went on to say: 'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or . something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment . ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.' Many were in disbelief that someone could present such an argument as the GOP senate hopeful attempted to explain his no-exception rule when it comes to abortion. Akin was elected to the Missouri House of . Representatives in 1988. He is a vocal anti-abortion campaigner with no . exceptions for rape or incest. At the time President Obama attacked Akin's . comments and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan both urged Akin to . drop out of his race for the U.S. Senate, but so far he has ignored . their calls. Alone: Following aspiring Missouri Senator Todd Akin's repellent comments on rape, his fellow Republicans have turned on him . President Barack Obama called Mr Akin's . statements on rape and abortion 'offensive' and 'way out there' on . Monday, and said politicians should not be making healthcare decisions . on behalf of women. 'Rape is rape and the idea that we should . be parsing and qualifying and slicing what types of rape we are talking . about doesn't make sense to the American people and certainly doesn't . make sense to me,' said the president to reporters in the White House briefing room back in August . Romney said he has 'an entirely . different view' than Mr Akin's, calling the candidate's comments . 'offensive.' The GOP presidential candidate also called on Akin to . correct his statements. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who had also endorsed Rivard, condemned . the lawmaker's comments, as did Republican U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy. Duffy . had not endorsed Rivard but had received a $500 campaign donation from . him. Duffy said he would donate the $500 to the Center Against Sexual . and Domestic Abuse in Superior. Opposition: President Barack Obama chimed in calling Akin's sentiment 'way out there' Distance: Republican Mitt Romney said Monday that Todd Akin's comments on rape are 'insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong' Nichole . Kathol, president of the Barron County Domestic Abuse Project, said . Rivard's comments portray women as perpetrators of violence against . them. 'He's blaming the victim and implying the definition of rape is all too encompassing,' she said. Pennie . Meyers, interim executive director of the Wisconsin Coalition Against . Sexual Assault, said in a statement that Rivard's comments show people . in Wisconsin need to be better educated about sexual violence. 'Unfortunately, comments like these are all too common, and an . indication of ways in which the culture is generally under educated . about what sexual assault is; sexual assault remains an under-reported . and under prosecuted crime,' her statement said.","Wisconsin state representative Roger Rivard made the comments in an interview last year when asked about an underage sex case involving a 17-year-old boy .

With the nights drawing in, the relentless rain and the gloomy skies, Seasonal Affective Disorder sufferers are dreading the impending months of Autumn and Winter. But the Met Office has plans to blow the clouds away, with a service that will warn sufferers that bad weather is on the way. SAD is a type of winter depression that affects an estimated 7 per cent of the UK population every winter between September and April, in particular during December, January and February. With the miserable weather set to be a daily feature for the next few months, the MET is inventing ways to help sufferers beat the 'winter blues' The UK has been battered by bad weather this year, with rain lashing the country and storms causing chaos . The national forecaster's 'Brighter Outlook' scheme alerts SAD patients via email, voicemail or text, that the clouds are rolling in and that they should use light boxes to cheer themselves up. It combines miserable weather alerts issued . by the Met Office with light therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy . (CBT) self-help material to help people. 'Light lounges' can help beat the blues of those who struggle to survive the wintery months . They said their scheme is a preventative service, aimed at helping people with SAD to manage their condition by warning them of periods of increased risk to their health and providing them with treatments to manage their condition. Brighter Outlook was piloted in . Cornwall from February to the end of April 2009. The Met Office, Outlook . South West and the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Primary Care Trust . worked together to provide the service. Everyone enrolled on the service was . provided with a light box and a self-help booklet that included some . tried and tested self-help strategies. These ideas were based on Cognitive . Behaviour Therapy and provided common-sense approaches to managing the . symptoms of winter depression. When gloomy weather was forecast, the Met Office provided alerts to people enrolled on the scheme. Participants chose to receive the alert either by email, text message or through an automated phone call. In a report of their findings, they wrote what a positive impact the service had on users. They wrote: 'Overall, the findings of the pilot were extremely encouraging. The findings show that before the trial (marked in green) the majority of participants' responses fell within the moderate-severe to severe category, but afterwards (marked in blue) participants fell better . While some of us love the autumnal scenes, others dread the accompanying dark nights and harsh weather . Parts of the UK, including Clifton Ings washlands in York, have been flooded as the cold months roll in . The condition is caused by a biochemical imbalance in the hypothalamus due to the shortening of daylight hours and the lack of sunlight in winter. The lack of light throws off our body clocks, leading to SAD. Symptoms include lethargy, sleep problems, loss of libido, anxiety, social problems, depression and craving for carbohydrates and sweet foods. For many people SAD is a disabling illness, preventing them from functioning normally without continuous medical treatment. For others, it is a mild condition causing discomfort but not severe suffering. This is known as subsyndromal SAD or 'winter blues.' It is estimated that a further 17 per cent of the UK population have this milder form of condition. Source SADA.ORG.UK . 'Their figures show that, prior to the pilot, the majority of participants' responses fell within the moderate-severe to severe depression (65.5 per cent). 'Post-trial only a small minority fell within these categories of depression (4.9 per cent) with the vast majority expressing mild to normal depressive symptoms (68.5 per cent).' A spokesman for the Met Office said: 'The purpose of the alerts was to give them 48 hours' warning at times when the level of gloominess meant they were at risk of their SAD symptoms becoming worse. 'This would prompt them to use their light boxes and practice the healthy living routines provided in the self-help booklet . 'These actions were aimed at reducing the effect of the gloomy weather on their health.' They are now discussing whether to roll out the service permanently, as part of their health service which gives guidance to asthma and hayfever sufferers. Most sufferers show signs of a weakened immune system during the winter, and are more vulnerable to illnesses. SAD symptoms disappear in spring, either suddenly with a short period of hyperactivity, or gradually, depending on the intensity of sunlight in the spring and early summer. In sub-syndromal SAD, symptoms such as tiredness, lethargy, sleep and eating problems occur, but depression and anxiety are absent or mild. SAD may begin at any age but the main age of onset is between 18 and 30 years. SAD occurs throughout the northern and southern hemispheres but is extremely rare in those living within 30 degrees of the Equator, where daylight hours are long, constant and extremely bright.","Service alerts people when bad weather is rolling in, so they can use light boxes to cheer themselves up .

Two Cold War missile sites that were readied for use when the world came to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis have been given listed status. The Thor missile site at the former RAF North Luffenham, Rutland, has been given a Grade II* listing, while the site at former RAF Harrington, Northamptonshire, has been listed at Grade II as a reminder of the 'knife-edge moment in history'. The two sites are the most intact examples of Thor missile bases in England, with concrete launch pads and blast walls still remaining, along with mounting bolts for the platforms that would raise the missiles into a vertical firing position. Historical importance: Former RAF North Luffenham, Rutland, which is one of two Cold War missile sites readied for use when the world came to the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis . The Government announced the sites were being protected on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, which saw the two bases put on alert and their Thor missiles readied for a possible launch on the Soviet Union. The crisis, in October 1962, saw the . Soviet Union and the US on the brink of nuclear conflict after the . Soviets sited armed nuclear weapons in Cuba. Following 13 days in which the world . held its breath, a deal was struck in which the Soviets would remove the . weapons and America would not invade Cuba. The listing, which recognises the two sites' architectural and historic importance, comes on the advice of English Heritage and is part of an ongoing project to ensure the best Cold War structures are preserved. Monuments: RAF Harrington, Northampton, pictured, and RAF North Luffenham have both been listed on the 50th anniversary of the crisis to recognise their historical importance . A total of 60 Thor missiles, . developed by the US, were deployed at 20 sites in the east of England . from 1958 under the codename Project Emily. They . were manned by the RAF, but their warheads remained under US control, . and the decision to launch them would have been made jointly by the two . countries. RAF North Luffenham is now St George's Barracks, while RAF Harrington is now mainly farmland. Armed: Thor missiles, developed by America, were deployed at bases all over the east of England from 1958 . Prepared: A specimen crew stand in front of the Thor missile on a different RAF site at Feltwell. File picture . Dr . Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, said: 'The remains . of the Cold War are fading from view faster than those of the world . wars. Named after the Norse god of thunder, 60 Thor missiles were deployed to Britain between 1959 and 1963. Fearful that the Soviet Union would produce a ballistic missile first, the US began developing the long-range missile in January 1956. Thor was the first operational ballistic missile deployed by the USAF, and the 65-foot weapon had a range of 1,500 miles. The Thor missiles deployed to Britain were operated by 20 squadrons of the RAF Bomber Command. 'Our Cold War heritage is a complicated . and not always easily loved collection of concrete bunkers and silos. But they are the castles and forts of the second half of the 20th . century and we want to ensure that the best examples survive. 'These two missile sites are among the few physical reminders in this country of the Cuban missile crisis, a moment when the entire world held its breath. 'They deserve to be protected to remind present and future generations of this knife-edge moment in history.' Heritage Minister Ed Vaizey added: 'Our Cold War heritage is often overlooked but it is an important reminder of a point in history and is worthy of protection. 'Listing these two missile sites is particularly poignant on the 50th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis and serves as a very physical reminder of an uncertain and tense period where the world feared a nuclear war.' English Heritage is holding a series of events to mark the 50th anniversary, including a programme of films, tours, talks and a photographic exhibition at the York Cold War bunker, and tours of secret tunnels beneath Dover Castle which would have housed government and military officials in the event of a nuclear attack.

But after tipping the scales at 18st 7lb and barely being able to squeeze into a size 20 dress, she realised she needed to take some of her own advice. Mother-of-two Lynne Runaghan, 45, shed six stone after being diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) - a condition which can lead to diabetes and even heart disease. Lynne gave healthy advice for a living but then decided is was time to listen to herself . Lynne Runaghan, 45, shifted six stone and dropped from a size 20 to a 12 . The occupational health nurse from Birmingham, West Midlands, tipped the scales at 18st 7Ib and was squeezing into a size 20 dress at her heaviest. Super-size Lynne scoffed huge meals at all hours of the day and night - gorging on her children’s food and eating huge portion sizes while working around night shifts. But after embarking on a strict exercise regime, she’s shed inches off her waist - and as her cankles disappeared she even went down a shoe size. Lynne said: 'I ballooned from a size 12 after having my children and I was tired, lethargic and miserable. 'I couldn’t wear pretty tops because my waist disappeared and I hated the way I looked. Lynne on holiday with her sons Callum and Euan before the weight loss . 'I was studying for a degree and a diploma and spent all my spare time working on assignments so the weight piled on.' After . being diagnosed with IGT, Lynne went for a walk up a hill with her . husband, Dave, on New Year’s Day 2010 and struggled to get to the top. 'I knew it was time to turn my life around - I couldn’t go on like this,' she said. Lynne tried diet after diet to shift the . excess weight, and would often eat next to nothing in an effort to slim . down - including replacing meals with health bars and shakes. Lynne is now addicted to cycling and rides up to 20 miles a day . Then she came across the Rosemary Conley diet - swapping takeaways and chocolate for chicken or fish and lots of veg, eating more than ever before. This combined healthy well-balanced eating with exercise classes to help kick-start the metabolism and reduce calorie intake. Lynne lost 8Ibs in just one week. She said: 'I felt so full, I could barely manage all 600 calories because I’d eaten so little the day before. 'I was eating the right things - lots of vegetables and salad. 'After two weeks I went on to a regulated diet and found I was so motivated I didn’t want to cheat.' Dave was very supportive and would make Lynne’s meals for her - losing three stones himself by following a similar diet. Lynne has lost weight by eating more, but with a greater focus on healthy food like meat, salad and vegetables . After losing a stone in just three weeks, Lynne took up cycling - something she now does for up to 20 miles a day. Lynne said: 'I'm totally addicted to cycling - I go to and from work on my bike in all weathers. I always ride at least ten miles a day, even in the rain and snow.' Lynne wasn't happy when she was larger but now she can shop wherever she likes . Since then, Lynne has dropped to a size ten clothes and weighs just 12 1/2 stone, meaning she can shop wherever she likes. She said: 'It’s been great working my way down the jeans sizes - it’s so motivating. 'Before I would just wear dark things to hide my shape which were fuddy-duddy - I wouldn’t go near a dress. 'I used to hate shopping as I couldn’t never find anything nice to wear for special occasions. 'Most of my friends are slim so I always felt like the odd one out and used to get really depressed. 'People never give you the same amount of attention when you’re overweight, they judge you by your weight rather than your personality.' Lynne has even managed to drop a shoe size after literally losing weight all over her body, making shopping for her feet just as fun now she is able to slip into a size eight shoe. Lynne said: 'I’ve got my tiny waist back and can’t believe I let myself get that big. 'My children always loved me no matter what I looked like and my husband fell in love with me at a size 16, but I think he likes the new me.' Now a new woman with bags of energy, Lynne is able to play an active part in her sons Callum, 19, and Euan’s, 13, lives, and spur other women like herself to lose weight. Lynne said: 'I use my weight loss as a tool to inspire others to lose weight. 'My job involves giving health information to schools and employers and it feels so much better to have some real experience to back what I’m saying up. 'I learnt some things myself - how easter eggs are literally all fat and how much sugar is in wine - that alone keep me from my worst habits! 'Someone told me I was their incentive to lose weight - and that feels really good. 'I’m not tired and aching all the time anymore either - and I’m eating more than I used to!'","Dropped from size 20 dress to size 12 .

Joy Fehily said in a brief email statement on the weekend that the 54-year-old actor . 'suffered a myocardial infarction' early on Friday. She said his heart rate had stabilised and he's expected to make a full recovery. Fehily would not confirm a . report that Duncan's actress-girlfriend, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth, . discovered the former bodyguard in distress at about 2am Friday in . his Los Angeles area home. The website reported that Omarosa revived Duncan by performing CPR. The former The Apprentice star, who has been dating the actor since 2010, is understood to be by his bedside in an intensive care unit. Her representative Priscilla Clarke . confirmed Duncan was hospitalised but didn't provide any further . details regarding his condition. Big boy: The 325 pounds Duncan co-starred with Tom Hanks, and David Morse in Frank Darabont's 1999 crime drama The Green Mile . Kent . Moran, who directed Duncan in The . Challenger, tells MailOnline the actor recently wrapped scenes on the . action drama, in which he stars as a trainer helping to revive the . career of boxer Jaden Miller. Moran, who also stars as Miller in the film, described Duncan as 'very healthy' on set and said he coped well with the physicality of the role, adding that news of the actor falling ill was 'unexpected'. He added: 'We were very surprised and saddened to hear the news. Our film . is now in post production and we have finished filming Michael's scenes.

Duncan's co-star from The Finder, Geoff Stults, visited the actor in hospital and said he is recovering well, telling TMZ: 'I saw him... he's looking good... that's all we know right now.' VIPs: The couple attended a pre-Grammy party earlier this year in February . Duncan meanwhile hinted at his health issues in a public service announcement released by PETA in May. The PSA, which promotes vegetarianism as a means to prevent heart disease and stroke, features Duncan saying he was plagued with several illnesses before making the dietary change three years ago. He does not elaborate on his health problems in the clip. The actor says watching film Meet Your Meat, about the process of animal protein production, helped him to decide to stop eating meat. 'I never knew what the process was from that animal to my plate,' he says. 'Once I looked at an animal like that I cleared out my refrigerator of about $5,000 worth of meat.' Duncan catapulted to fame after his role in 1999 prison drama The Green Mile. He is also well-known for his roles in the 2003 comic book movie Daredevil and 2005 release Sin City. He is currently starring in TV drama The Finder. Watch video here .","Girlfriend Omarosa Stallworth is said to have performed CPR .

The two muddy patches at the side of the street were crying out for a little love and attention. So when GP Susannah Beattie spent her own time and money making them look attractive by planting some shrubs, neighbours were delighted. But days later a letter arrived from the council saying the work had been done without its approval. 'Licence to cultivate': Angry GP Susannah Beattie and local councillor Geoff Heathcock by the spruced up muddy verge in Cambridge with the small number of plants she put in, in front of them . Dr Beattie, 47, was told she had to apply for a ‘licence to cultivate’ – a process that involved submitting a detailed plan and paying an £84 fee. She reluctantly agreed to the demand but yesterday criticised the ‘tick-box culture’ that threatens to stifle public-spirited behaviour. Dr Beattie, who was yesterday resigned to paying the fee, has demanded a rethink on the 30-year-old rules she claims leave no room for common sense. 'It doesn’t make sense to be discouraging the local community from beautifying the neighbourhood,' she said. Dr Beattie planted the greenery on council-owned land at the end of her driveway in Cambridge in the last week of September. The land on each side had been churned up into a muddy mess by residents and visitors to a nearby GP surgery as they parked their cars. Grateful neighbours commented on how lovely it looked after Dr Beattie’s efforts. Dismal: The GP put in a measly number of shrubs into this bed, and one across the road from it, to stop illegal parkers and make her area look nicer, but Cambridgeshire County Council say she has broken the law and must pay £84 to them . Jobsworths: A map drawn by Susannah Beattie to show where she had planted a peppering of pretty plants but her local authority have hit the roof . But on October 10, a letter from Cambridgeshire County Council arrived saying she had breached the 1980 Highways Act, under which local authorities control planting on public land. In the plan she had to submit, Dr Beattie explained how the planting ‘replaced a weedy, bald area of ground’. Letters outlined what greenery had been planted and where – including lily of the valley bush and hardy geranium. The council’s highways department has now approved her application. Local councillor Geoff Heathcock said no one who tries to improve their neighbourhood should be treated like a criminal. He added: ‘This action is both unnecessary and petty compared to the damage that is done all year round by parking on verges.’ The council insisted the application for a licence was standard practice. A spokesman said: ‘The fee covers the cost of inspecting the site and agreeing a planting scheme.’","Dr Susannah Beattie put in shrubs to put off illegal parkers in Cambridge .

A 'mobile response' team of Border Force officers intended to ease airport congestion is sleeping on night shifts, strolling around Heathrow's shops and drinking coffee, according to leaked emails. One officer was told to 'get his head down' on a night shift and has described spending his time shuttling between terminals rather than dealing with passenger queues. He said caustically he failed to see the advantage of staff 'happily relaxing on a scenic bus ride around the airport' while colleagues were in need of help elsewhere in the airport. Long wait: Passengers vented their fury at being stuck in queues at Heathrow Terminal 5's passport control (file photo) Paralysis: The head of the UK's Border Force Brian Moore was asked how he would react if there were four-hour queues during the Olympics. He replied: 'So be it' The insight has raised fears that plans to install more mobile squads to ease the now-notorious delays at passport control could prove to have little impact. According to emails seen by the Daily Telegraph, rather than helping with the politically and economically damaging queues, the anonymous officer tells of aimless wandering around Heathrow when working with the mobile team. He writes: 'As to the night shift itself, we started at 21:00 hrs & spent until 22:30 strolling around the airport, drinking coffee & trying on Oakley sunglasses in the duty free shopping area.' He added: 'From 23:30 I was told to ""get my head down somewhere"" until 4:30 ish.' The paper said the emails revealed that teams - of which there are reportedly 16 mobile teams of ten - were rarely sent in time during the day, thereby missing congestion in some cases because of the distance between airport buildings. Last weekend the officer worked at Terminal 3, and told how he spent a couple of hours reading a magazine. On a previous occasion on duty at the same terminal, the Telegraph said he had 'no passengers whatsoever' for nearly an hour, while Terminal 1 was, he said, 'heaving'. A Border Force spokesperson said: 'These claims misrepresent the effectiveness of using mobile teams who can move around the airport to meet demand. Caustic: The unnamed Border Force official wrote that he was spending time 'happily relaxing on a scenic bus ride around the airport', rather than helping colleagues . 'This approach is sensible planning and is just one way to deliver a secure border that has the right numbers of staff at the rights times, meaning that the vast majority of passengers pass through immigration controls quickly.' The claims came as it was revealed passengers at Stansted Airport faced 'unacceptably long' immigration queues at the beginning of the Bank Holiday weekend. Hundreds of disgruntled passengers were delayed for up to two hours at passport control at the Essex airport yesterday evening. A spokesman for Stansted airport said action was needed to address the issue of long waits urgently. Visit: Immigration Minister Damian Green during a visit to Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport . He said: 'The majority of passengers . arriving at Stansted pass through border controls quickly and securely. However, at peak times, and similar to many other UK airports, . immigration queues can be unacceptably long. 'We recognise that maintaining strong . border security is a priority but we also want to see sufficient . resources available to meet passenger demand and keep delays to a . minimum at the busiest times. 'Our customer service teams work . closely with the UK Border Force to help manage queues and assist . passengers at peak times but we believe further action is needed to . address the issue as a matter of urgency.' One passenger told the BBC she waited . for two hours at passport control, another said after a flight from . Cork she waited so long they were put into another area. A Border Force spokesman said: 'We . flexibly deploy staff to meet demand, meaning that the vast majority of . passengers pass through immigration controls quickly. 'We will not compromise border security but work closely with airport operators to keep delays to a minimum.' The Government has announced it is planning to draft in 80 extra staff in the wake of criticism  of the lengthy delays. Immigration minister Damian Green has . admitted the Border Force needs to change the way it operates and said . the extra staff would start work this month. Ministers . have already been warned they face a ‘summer of chaos’ caused by long . queues at passport control due to a huge influx of visitors for the . Olympic Games and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Airlines and airport bosses have criticised the queues and unions have complained that staff cuts are causing delays. Ministers are to draft in more than 550 volunteers in a desperate bid to avoid chaos at border posts during the Olympics. The volunteers will receive just four days of training on how to operate passport controls at ports and airports, according to the Times. Positions will be filled by staff from Revenue and Customs, retired immigration officers and those who have taken voluntary redundancy. The plan had been limited to London airports but in a sign that Ministers are keen to avoid embarrassing delays it has been extended to Calais, Dunkirk, Bristol and UK controls in Paris. It was announced this week that immigration staff are to stage a one-day strike in the bitter dispute over public sector pensions, threatening huge disruption at airports including Heathrow. The Immigration Services Union (ISU), which represents 4,500 Border Agency staff, said its members will walk out next Thursday at ports and airports across the UK and abroad. And figures released this week revealed that air passengers have been forced to queue at immigration for twice as long as ministers previously suggested. News that travellers were delayed for up to 3 hours at immigration - double the length of time the Government had estimated – comes as it emerged the UK Border Force failed to meet its Heathrow passport control targets on an almost daily basis. Fresh evidence of the true extent of the Heathrow passport control fiasco was presented to Home Secretary Theresa May as she met on Thursday with airline bosses seeking a solution to the predicted 'summer of chaos'. The queue figures were produced by Heathrow operator BAA which says its statistics are more detailed, accurate and robust than those compiled for the Home office by the UK Border Force.",Claims come as Stansted passengers faced 'unacceptably long' queues .

The two women from Sarasota, Florida, have been inseparable for decades. Even when Garcia was married for five years in the 1950s and had her own home, it was across the street from her mom. ‘Literally, these two ladies have been together all their lives,’ said Albert Garcia, Maria's 60-year-old son. ‘It's a spiritual ping-pong match between both of them and that's what keeps them going and alive.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Inseparable: Rosario Schielzeth (left), 104, and her 87-year-old daughter Maria Garcia (right) enjoying their favorite pastime - Bingo. The two have been living together for some 60 years . ‘That's the best thing for people in that situation. Talk all the time,’ she said.

The two women then sit down to a leisurely breakfast and chat. After lunch, Schielzeth retreats to her bedroom to pray, but she can't stay long because Garcia always asks after her.

When she was a girl, living in Costa Rica, it was her siblings. She was born in 1908, one of ten children, so the older ones were expected to help out. Then it was her two daughters, and then her grandchildren, Albert and James Garcia. When Albert Garcia was a baby, his musician father, whom he describes affectionately as ‘a Puerto Rican Clark Gable with a pencil mustache,’ ran off with a flight attendant .

With additional thanks to Oxford University, which five years ago set up the Galaxy Zoo project - a bid to get the public helping astronomers sift through the overwhelming influx of data pouring in from the far reaches of the universe. The university uploaded over a million images of galaxies captured by telescopes such as Hubble, and then asked web-users to view and classify them according to their shape. So far, 250,000 people have helped with . the work, turning the data into a wealth of scientific knowledge - as . well as a nifty web application that lets you spell sentences out using . actual galaxies to form the letters. And, as an additional bonus, as no-one has set eyes on these images before you, you are the first human to gaze at these far-flung places. 'I can see your house from here': The Galaxy Zoo team also have fun spelling messages in the stars . The Galaxy Writer has become a popular . and fun tool for both star-gazers and casual browsers, as well as . serving as a promotional tool for the endeavour. But . beyond spelling on an intergalactic level, the process is helping to . classify spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and many irregular-shaped . ones, including, according to the researchers, one which looks like a . penguin. The 'Penguin' galaxy: This shape was possibly formed when two galaxies collided . From today, the site includes more another 250,000 new images of galaxies, most of which have never been seen by humans. Galaxy Zoo principal investigator Dr . Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, said: 'We’d like to thank . all those that have taken part in Galaxy Zoo in the past five years. 'Humans are better than computers at pattern recognition tasks like this, and we couldn’t have got so far without everyone’s help. 'Now we’ve got a new challenge and we’d like to encourage volunteers old and new to get involved. 'You don’t have to be an expert – in fact we’ve found not being an expert tends to make you better at this task. 'There are too many images for us to inspect ourselves, but by asking hundreds of thousands of people to help us we can find out what’s lurking in the data.' Among the spiral and elliptical . galaxies that the volunteers have characterised and classified, they . have found an entire alphabet of galaxies. Galaxy . Zoo team member Dr Steven Bamford of the University of Nottingham has . created a website at www.mygalaxies.co.uk where anyone can write their . name in the stars. The team are also keen to add more animals to the volunteers’ celestial zoo, having found a convincing penguin-shaped galaxy. ABC as easy as 123: Scientists are also finding irregular shapes in the skies, caused when galaxies collide . Along with the quirky appeal of such findings, the researchers suggest such unusual formations may also tell us something about what happens when galaxies collide. The new images on the Galaxy Zoo site come from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a ground-based telescope in New Mexico, and from large surveys with NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. Astronomer and Galaxy Zoo team member Kevin Schawinski from ETH Zurich in Switzerland said: 'The two sources of data work together perfectly: the new images from Sloan give us our most detailed view of the local universe, while the CANDELS survey from the Hubble telescope allows us to look deeper into the universe’s past than ever before.' The team are hoping that the hard work of volunteers on the new site will allow data from the two telescopes to be compared, offering insights into how nearby galaxies as we see them today may have arisen from how the universe looked in the past. Dr Karen Masters from the University of Portsmouth, another team member, said: 'In astronomy, we’re lucky enough to get to see both the past and the present of the universe. 'By comparing the two, we can try to understand the forces which have shaped the formation of the galaxies in it, including our own Milky Way.'","Oxford University project gets web-users to classify millions of new galaxies spotted by Hubble and ground-based telescopes .

A California schoolboy has been forced to stay at home after his school banned him from attending classes because he carries the gene for cystic fibrosis. Colman Chadam, 11, carries the genetic mutation for cystic fibrosis but doesn't actually have the disease and shows no outward symptoms. The disease is incurable and life threatening and causes the body to create a thick mucous that clogs the lungs and can cause deadly infections. But although it's not contagious, people with the disease or the gene can pose a risk to each other through bacterial cross-contamination if they are in close contact. The disease effects about 30,000 Americans but more than 10 million Americans carry the defective cystic fibrosis gene without knowing it. Colman's parents say their son poses no risk to other pupils and are fighting the decision, made by Jordan Middle School, in Palo Alto. Teachers said Colman must be removed as an undisclosed number of other students at the school already have the disease. The school argues that, if Colman were allowed to continue attending classes, there is a risk of cross-contamination. Colman's parents, who said the school has overreacted, are waiting for a court ruling on the matter next Thursday. Colman Chadam, 11, pictured with his mother, carries the gene for cystic fibrosis but doesn't have the disease . The school says if Colman were allowed to continue attending classes, there is a risk of cross-contamination . They say that their son does not have the disease and shows no symptoms - an assertion backed by the family's doctor. They also claim they did the right thing in . disclosing Colman's genetic predisposition to cystic fibrosis on a . school medical form at the beginning of the year. But they did not . expected the school to take such a hard line and bar Colman from . the school. Colman's mother Jennifer Chadam told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'They made this decision without seeing one medical record on my son.' Home schooling: Until a court rules on his future, Colman is attempting to continue his studies uninterrupted at home . Jordan Middle School: The school says that it has taken medical advice that removing Colman would be the 'zero risk' option for other students . She added: 'If I felt Colman was a risk to others, I would move him. I don't want anyone to get sick.' Colman told Today: 'I was sad but at . the same time I was mad because I understood that I hadn't done anything . wrong. It feels like I'm being bullied in a way that is not right.' At the heart of the problem lies conflicting opinion on the risk of cross-infection among cystic fibrosis sufferers, or those who are at genetic risk for the disease. The school says it has consulted with medical experts and has taken the 'zero risk' option in removing Colman from the school. The plight of the Chadams supports a UK study last year that claimed students with allergies often suffered discrimination at school. The study, from the University of Leicester, said affected children often felt isolated, stigmatised or left out of school activities. Symptoms: While cystic fibrosis is mainly related to lung problems, it can also affect general growth, heart function, fertility, digestion and sinuses . Cystic fibrosis is a recessive genetic disorder predominantly affecting the lungs. It can also affect the heart, liver, pancreas and intestine. The name refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and cyst formation within the pancreas, first recognised in the 1930s. The disease can be treated with antibiotics and other medications but is only manageable, not curable. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that regulates sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. Most people have two working copies of the gene, although only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. If both parents have a mutation of the gene, cystic fibrosis will occur in their offspring. It is most common among Caucasians. Symptoms include salty tasting skin, poor growth and poor weight gain, frequent chest infections, coughing or shortness of breath. Major symptoms appear in infancy, so late onset of the disease is uncommon.","Colman Chadam carries genetic mutation for cystic fibrosis, but does not have the disease or display any symptoms .

A Businessman who marched a thieving employee to a police station with a sign around his neck says his actions have left him on the verge of bankruptcy and cost him his relationship and home. Simon Cremer, 48, frogmarched Mark Gilbert through a town centre after he discovered the sub-contractor had written an £845 company cheque to himself. Mr Cremer was later arrested for false imprisonment – which carries a maximum life sentence – although the case was dropped. Simon Cremer, 48, made Mark Gilbert walk through the streets of Witham, in Essex, to humiliate him because Gilbert had written and cashed a cheque to himself for £845 from the company . But his ‘victim’ received only a police caution and went on to launch a civil case against him.Mr Cremer agreed to pay £5,000 in an out-of-court settlement but has been told he has to pay £40,000 solicitors’ fees on top. The stress of the case led to the collapse of his relationship with long-term partner Karen Boardman, 48, who was recovering from a double mastectomy after developing breast cancer. The couple sold their home at Little Maplestead, near Halstead in Essex but Miss Boardman, who put up most of the money for the three-bedroom house, was left with negative equity. Mr Cremer said he is now paying her £400 a month to make up the shortfall. ‘I am disgusted at the whole thing. The legal system is wrong,’ flooring company boss Mr Cremer told the Mail yesterday. ‘I don’t think Mr Gilbert should have had the right to sue me. I was the one who was wronged in the first place but it is me who is suffering. ‘Yes, I took him to the police station, I hold my hands up to that. But it has cost me everything.’ Mr Cremer provoked a wave of public support for his actions when he subjected Gilbert to the 350 yard walk of shame through Witham, Essex, in September 2008. Around his neck on a piece of cardboard was the message: ‘THIEF. I stole £845. Am on my way to police station.’ Mr Cremer is now calling on the Government to ban criminals from benefitting financially in the civil courts . But the decision to make an example of him backfired when he and three colleagues found they were facing a range of charges including false imprisonment. The criminal charges were eventually dropped but Gilbert – who claimed he was only taking wages he was owed – lodged a case for £40,000 damages, saying the embarrassment of being paraded had left him too traumatised to work for two years. He also claimed he had feared for his life after he was allegedly tied up and bundled into a van before walking the last stretch of the journey to the police station. Mr Cremer, who has two grown-up daughters from a previous relationship, agreed to pay £5,000 compensation but was horrified by the £35,000 legal bill that came with it. ‘A barrister heard about my case and worked on my behalf for free. He got £9,000 taken off the bill in 2009,’ he said. ‘I still couldn’t afford to pay that because business has been tight. Now, after a lot of wrangling, the bill has gone back up to £40,000 because they are charging interest. ‘I had no option but to agree to this last week. They wanted a £10,000 lump sum and £1,000 a month but finally agreed to £5,000 and £500 per month. ‘It will probably bankrupt me, to be honest. What happened didn’t affect my business – every single customer supported me. ‘But the recession hit them and that hit my business. I used to turn over £300-400,000 a year but last year that was down to around £75,000 and my profit is normally 25 per cent of that net. ‘On top of that, my relationship with Karen broke down in May last year. It was getting too tough for her. ‘She was left with negative equity after the house was sold for about £300,000, so I am helping her out.’ Miss Boardman lived in a rented house after selling her home and has now moved in with a new partner. The GP’s receptionist said: ‘Simon overstepped the mark but he didn’t deserve to lose everything. It’s wrong that a criminal has been able to claim compensation.’ Witham Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This case has clearly had a devastating impact upon Mr Cremer and that is just dreadful. Common sense should have prevailed in the way it was handled in terms of the criminal process and civil complaint.’ Gilbert, 43, who moved from Colchester to Bristol, after receiving the caution, was unavailable to comment yesterday.","Mark Gilbert handed caution for stealing from his employer in 2008 .

Buffalo Bill: The mansion built by Rod Kush, pictured in 1981 as safety for the Buffalo Bills, will be burned to the ground . A 14,000-square-foot palace built by a former NFL player is set to be burned to the ground as part of a firefighter training exercise. The luxurious estate in Gretna, Nebraska, was home to ex-Buffalo Bills safety Rod Kush and was once worth $2.6 million. But the 'finest mansion in all of Sarpy County' will soon be set alight room-by-room by the Gretna Volunteer Fire Department, after being overrun with mold. 'It would cost more to mitigate the mold damage than the house is worth,' Sarpy County Assessor Dan Pittman told the Omaha World-Herald. Mr Kush, who also owned a chain of small furniture stores, completed the lavish 17-room home in 1997 and sold it after 10 years, when he ran into financial troubles. The property, which sits on 35 acres, changed hands a couple of times before it was snapped up by a developer for just $612,000 in 2010. But last month Mr Pittman said the mansion is now worthless. He said a leaky roof was never fixed and mold soon took over the house. 'At one time there was nothing like it in Sarpy County, with that big staircase like something out of 'Gone with the Wind,'' Mr Pittman told the newspaper. 'But it got to the point where there was standing water in the house and it wasn't safe to enter it without a mask.' The palace was built between 1996 and 1997 by the Omaha native whose NFL career lasted from 1980 to 1986. Luxurious: In its heyday, the Nebraska property, pictured, was called the 'finest mansion in all of Sarpy County' Overrun with mold: The County says the property, pictured, is now worthless because it is overrun with mold . After retiring, he opened Rod Kush's Furniture, a store that was well-known in the greater Omaha area but went out of business in 2007. Mr Kush initially put the property on the market for $3.4 million in 2003. He finally sold it for $1.6 million in December 2008 to FRK Development of the Elkhorn area. After a year, FRK Development donated . the property to Catholic Charities, which planned to open a 16-bed . substance-abuse treatment centre on the site but a lack of funds meant . it never happened.

A controversial blood test for prostate cancer may have significantly improved the survival prospects of patients diagnosed with advanced disease, research has shown. Scientists identified a reduced risk of dying of almost a third since the widespread introduction of the PSA (prostate specific antigen) test in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The PSA test identifies a protein in the blood that can signify the presence of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cells: Researchers say the PSA test can cut deaths, even though it is not used routinely in the UK or US . Critics say the test is too unreliable to be used for routine screening, which is why there is no automatic PSA testing in the UK. Instead, it is used on a case by case basis with men who exhibit symptoms. But the new American study suggests that widespread PSA testing can save lives. The test is used more often in the US than the UK, though the American Cancer Society no longer recommends it for routine screening. Scientists studied survival data from prostate cancer trials conducted before and after PSA testing was introduced in 1987. In the two earlier trials, which enrolled patients between 1985 and 1994, typical patient survival was 30 and 33 months. By the time the later trial was conducted, between 1995 and 2009, survival had increased to 49 months. The risk of death had reduced by around 30%. All the patients had newly diagnosed advanced cancer that had spread to the bones and were receiving hormone deprivation therapy. Between the earlier and later trials the survival gap between African American and Caucasian men with prostate cancer narrowed. African American survival rose from 27 months to 48 months. Men of African descent are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer than white men. Study leader Professor Ian Thompson, from the University of Texas at San Antonio, said: 'Our analysis indicates an overall improvement in risk adjusted survival rates for non-African American and African American men. The PSA test uses a simple blood test to look for a key indicator of prostate cancer . 'Of note is the resolution of disparity in survival between the races found in earlier studies. 'While not all of these welcome improvements can be attributed strictly to PSA testing, without a doubt it has played a role in extending many lives.' The research is published in the Journal of Urology. Previous studies have suggested that PSA testing saves few lives and in many cases can lead to risky and unnecessary treatments.","PSA test not used routinely in the UK because of fears over reliability .

Lying in crumpled heaps, severed body parts strewn nearby, this is the terrible toll of the ivory trade on a once-thriving herd of elephants. Thirty-five carcasses of the majestic gentle giants were found mutilated in a single attack by poachers at a popular safari destination in Cameroon. The heart-breaking sight was captured by a photographer last month - 20 years after the global ivory trade was officially banned to protect Africa's herds. In the aftermath of the slaughter at Bouba N'djida National Park, a terrified young elephant was seen cowering around his mother's corpse – the only living elephant the photographer saw in the park for a whole week. Brutal: The shapeless and lifeless bodies of these once beautiful elephants are shown strewn across the national park having all been murdered . Disgusting: This poor animal's trunk has been removed and discarded once its ivory has been taken . Local activists say 400 elephants may . have been killed in this park alone since the beginning of the year – . almost its total population according to the World Wildlife Fund.

Cameroon is one of a number of African . countries whose elephants are at risk of extinction due to a spike in . organised gangs of poachers targeting them for their tusks. Hacked apart with most of their faces . missing, they took chainsaws to the animals heads to reach the valuable . ivory which sells for up to £10,000 for a large tusk – leaving a severed . trunk nearby. Poachers are often poor locals, but in . this case they were a horseback-riding gang carrying machine guns, . thought to have travelled 1,000 miles from Sudan across Central Africa . and Chad to reach this site. Photographer Jean-Francois Lagrot, who . works for a local NGO fighting wildlife crime, captured these scenes in . early March, at great personal risk after the site was sealed off by . soldiers. While Cameroon authorities are now . trying to police the park, campaigners fear it may be too little too . late to save the once-numerous herds. Shock: In spite of a worldwide ivory ban the slaughter of wild elephants for money by poachers carries on . Haul: The photographer discovers piles of tusks all taken by killing elephants illegally . He said: 'There is a spike in poaching . all over Africa, it is terrible at the moment. These are the sort of . poachers you do not mess with. They are on horseback and have weapons. 'They bribe local villagers with the . elephant meat so they don't tell the authorities and the result is more . and more slaughtering of elephants. 'Journalists were kept away from the . slaughter and they did not allow a census of all the dead elephants . because of the negative image for Cameroon.' In his view, backed up by the World . Wildlife Fund which works in the country, the reason for the spike is . clear – relentless demand for ivory from the Far East and particularly . China. With its peoples' rising personal . wealth and a taste for intricately-carved ivory jewellery and crockery, . hundreds of tonnes is making its way to their shores. Mr Lagrot said elite army units were . sent to the Park to secure the protected area and push the poachers out, . but while they made them take flight, none were caught and one the army . drivers was said to have been shot. He said: 'Witnesses heard 63 shots . from the camp during six long minutes of shooting. There were 35 dead at . this site, and another 10 elephants a couple of kilometres away. They . packed the tusks in maize bags. 'They didn't catch them and the . horsemen were seen riding North towards Waza National Park [nearby] and . asking villagers about the corridor for elephants.' Solemn: A bystander sits surrounded by bodies in the elephant graveyard . A Panorama investigation screened last . night found the global trade in ivory is at its worst since records . after the 1989 ban, with incidents of elephant slaughter also on the . rise in Kenya, Tanzania and Congo. Hauls of elephant tusks found at ports . in Africa and Asia reached 24 tonnes last year, double the figure for . 2010. The seizures equate to around 2,500 dead elephants in 2011 alone – . and that's only the ones they found. In Samburu in northern Kenya, where . numbers of elephants have plummeted by a quarter in three years, camera . crews were shown the carcass of a dead female elephant who was pregnant, . and the remains of her unborn calf. Reporters in Hong Kong found ivory . being carved by craftsmen and much of it sold without the official . paperwork required to show it has been legally sourced. Rise: A new BBC investigation found elephant numbers in Kenya had dropped due to illegal killing . Many critics blame CITES the . international treaty which banned the global ivory trade, for a recent . decision to allow African countries to sell stockpiled of ivory they had . seized which may have driven up demand. Dr. Allard Blom, managing director of . WWF's Congo Basin program said the situation in Cameroon was 'the worst . poaching massacre that I can recall in the decades we have worked to . save elephants in Africa'. 'Poaching is escalating because of a . growing demand for ivory from Asia and if we fail to take immediate . action in the face of such plunder, then much of Africa's elephants . could disappear forever to satisfy human greed', he said.","Photographer who found the bodies fears up to 1,000 could be dead in the Boubandjida National Park, Cameroon ."

A love-cheat investment banker helped . his two girlfriends make more than £2million by leaking insider . information, a court heard yesterday. Thomas Ammann, 39, handed over the . confidential details about a future City takeover bid to Christina . Weckwerth and Jessica Mang, it was claimed. The two women allegedly used the . sensitive insider information to ‘almost double their money’ by buying . and selling shares in one company. Ammann, who worked at the London . offices of Japanese bank Mizuho, was one of only seven at the bank who . knew that global electronics company Canon was planning a takeover of .

Weckwerth, 44, . made nearly £2million while Mang, 29, pocketed £60,000 from their . illicit trading, it was claimed. Prosecutor Amanda Pinto QC told . Southwark Crown Court yesterday that Ammann pleaded guilty to two counts . of encouraging insider dealing and two counts of insider dealing . earlier this year. She said: ‘In broad terms these  two women managed to almost  double their money by trading in just one stock. ‘Each of these women considered that Thomas Ammann was their boyfriend and they had no idea of the existence of the other.’ The court heard that on March 12, . 2009, Canon sent a confidential letter expressing its interest in a . takeover of Oce to a select group who were working on the deal, . including Ammann. The next day Weckwerth bought 14,500 shares in Oce, it . was alleged. Three days later, after a weekend with Ammann, she bought another 20,000 shares, the jury heard. The prosecutor added: ‘Thomas Ammann . and Christina Weckwerth sent several texts and had very long phone calls . on the evening of March 12. The following day, after another call, she . invested in those shares.’ And in April 2009 Weckwerth approached . the Bank of Cyprus with a view to setting up her own company to handle . her share trades, it was said. She hired a team of staff and made an . initial £320,000 investment from her share dealing. Lovers: Southwark Crown Court heard that neither women knew of each other's existence and both considered Ammann to be their boyfriend .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:06 EST, 17 October 2012 . A Texas man claiming to follow orders from Iranian military officials pleaded guilty in court Wednesday to plotting to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. Manssor Arbabsiar, 58, admitted to plotting and agreeing . to hire what he thought was a Mexican drug dealer last year for $1.5 . million to carry out the attack with explosives at a Washington . restaurant. He was described by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara as 'the extended murderous hand of his co-conspirators, officials . of the Iranian military based in Iran, who plotted to kill the Saudi . Ambassador in the United States and were willing to kill as many . bystanders as necessary to do so.' Plot: Manssor Arbabsiar (left) has pleaded guilty to a plot to murder Saudi ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir (right) Attorney General Eric Holder cited the efforts of law enforcement and . intelligence agencies in disrupting 'a deadly plot approved by members . of the Iranian military to assassinate a sitting foreign ambassador on . U.S. soil.' Arbabsiar entered the plea to two . conspiracy charges and a murder-for-hire count in U.S. District Court in . Manhattan and the trial has been set for January. A U.S. citizen who holds an Iranian passport, Arbabsiar faces up to 25 years in prison. When the plot was uncovered last September, President Barack Obama's administration accused agents of the Iranian government of being involved. Bharara said Arbabsiar 'was in telephone contact with his Iranian confederates while he brokered an audacious plot.' Arbabsiar, pictured in this courtroom sketch in Manhattan Criminal Court, faces up to 25 years in prison . At the plea, Arbabsiar confirmed that officials in the Iranian military were involved in the plot . Arbabsiar admitted that he was directed . by Iranian military officials to go to Mexico on multiple occasions from . the spring to the fall last year to arrange the assassination. Arbabsiar, who lived in Corpus Christie, Texas, for more than a decade, said he went to Mexico last year to meet a man named Junior, 'who turned out to be an FBI agent.' He said that he and others had agreed to arrange the kidnapping of the ambassador, Adel Al-Jubeir, but Junior said it would be easier to kill the ambassador. Arbabsiar has been held without bail since he was arrested Sept. 29, 2011 at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The government said in a news release . that Arbabsiar had described to the Drug Enforcement Administration source how his cousin in Iran, a . 'big general' in the Iranian military, had requested that Arbabsiar . find someone to carry out the ambassador's assassination. It said Arbabsiar rejected as 'no big . deal' the DEA's worries about bystanders in a restaurant bombing, . including the possibility that U.S. senators who dine there could be . killed. Watched: The terror plot involved bombing the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C., seen here, after assassinating the ambassador . The Saudi Embassy is located next to the Watergate complex in Washington DC . He was brought into court Wednesday in handcuffs. He spoke English and did not use a translator, despite saying he understood only about half of what he read in English. Bearded and bespectacled, he smiled several times during the proceeding, including in the direction of courtroom artists who were seated in the jury box when he entered court. Defense lawyers say Arbabsiar suffers from bipolar disorder. Kim said that if the government had proceeded to trial, it would have presented a jury with secretly recorded conversations between Arbabsiar and a confidential source, along with Arbabsiar's extensive post-arrest statement to authorities and emails and financial records. Authorities have said they secretly recorded conversations between Arbabsiar and an informant with the Drug Enforcement Administration after Arbabsiar approached the informant in Mexico and asked his knowledge of explosives for a plot to blow up the Saudi embassy in Washington. They said Arbabsiar later offered $1.5 million for the death of the ambassador. Arbabsiar admitted Wednesday that he eventually made a $100,000 down payment wired from an overseas account through a Manhattan bank. After his arrest, Arbabsiar confessed . that he was recruited, funded and directed by men he believed were . senior officials in Iran's Qods Force, a branch of the Iranian Islamic . Revolutionary Guard Corps that in 2007 was designated by the U.S. Treasury Department as a supporter of the Taliban and terrorist . organizations, the government said. Suspect: Alleged terror plotter Manssor Arbabsiar's home in Round Rock, Texas . Arbabsiar told the court that he only understood about half of what he read out in court in English . It said he claimed that he met several . times in Iran with Gholam Shakuri, a co-conspirator and Iran-based . member of the Qods Force, and another senior Qods Force official. After . his arrest, Arbabsiar made phone calls at the direction of law . enforcement to Shakuri in Iran and Shakuri confirmed that Arbabsiar . should move forward with the ambassador plot, the government said. Shakuri, also charged in the plot, remains a fugitive. Iran formally complained to the U.S. last October over the claims that the Iranian government was involved in the plot to kill Adel Al-Jubeir. The U.S. received a diplomatic note expressing displeasure with the charges. The complaint called on the U.S. to apologize publicly to Iran for the 'material and moral damages' caused by 'this baseless accusation.' It added that the accusations violated . 'international rules and regulations' but that deception has become 'a . permanent part of statecraft in the U.S.' The note was delivered through the . Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents U.S. interests in Iran since . the two countries don't have diplomatic relations.","Manssor Arbabsiar was arrested when he tried to hire a Mexican drug dealer to carry out the attack at a Washington restaurant .

A business manager who was run over by a thug in a getaway car after he helped a policewoman in danger insists risking his own life was worth it for the good of British society. Christopher Price, 57, received a standing ovation from police officers as the only member of the public to be recognised for bravery at a special ceremony in London this month. In a brave bid to stop a fleeing . suspect who attacked a female PC, the father-of-three from Hampstead, north London, threw himself . into the path of a car as the driver slammed into gear and drove . straight at him. But the modest hero insists he was simply doing what he 'needed to do' and instead paid tribute to the bravery police show every day. Brave: Christopher Price stands close to where he was run down after trying to stop a criminal get away . 'You get the society you deserve if you’re prepared to put the effort in,' he said after receiving a certificate of commendation at Camden Town Hall. 'I happened to be there at the time and that was what I needed to do. I wasn’t prepared to see someone get pushed around on the street.' Danger: Mr Price could have been killed when he tried to intervene when a policewoman was in trouble in Prince Arthur Road in Hampstead . Mr Price added: 'I was particularly impressed and touched by the . standing ovation from officers, some of whom have effectively disarmed . people with guns when they were unarmed. 'That is real heroism, that is amazing, I just got into a situation and I did what I did to help.' Mr Price noticed a man running into Prince Arthur Road in Hampstead . chased by a policewoman on June 20 this year. Shopkeepers had earlier . seen two men acting suspiciously as an elderly woman used a cash point . in Hampstead High Street and called police. One man was arrested as officers arrived but a scuffle broke out as the other man tried to escape. Mr Price, who was walking from a business meeting in the area, . spotted the policewoman being thrown about and decided to step in. 'In true pantomime style, I was shouting, ""He’s behind you"" and she . tried to grab him but he was a big athletic Usain Bolt-like man,' he . said. 'She grabbed hold of him and he threw her away so I went to help.' As Mr Price approached the man climbed into a nearby getaway car and locked the doors. The policewoman then smashed the driver’s window with her baton as Mr . Price tried to get into the passenger’s side, before coming around to . the front of the car. 'He then decided he was going to blow me out of the way,' said Mr . Price. 'He slammed it into first gear and drove straight at me, I did a . roll over the bonnet and smashed down quite hard.' The collision left Mr Price needing hospital treatment for bruising and damage to his hip and knee. Police have since indentified the driver, who remains at large, and . have issued a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of grievous bodily . harm with intent. Paying tribute to Mr Price Chief superintendent John Sutherland, . Camden borough commander, said: 'We live in . a world where all too often people walk by when circumstances demand . they do something, but today is about recognising the people who didn’t . walk by.' It came as police officers are due to be honoured for acts of bravery tonight, including dragging passengers from burning cars and confronting armed criminals without a weapon themselves. A total of 53 from forces across the country have been nominated for the annual Police Bravery Awards, held to recognise officers who have risked their lives in the line of duty. The event has a particular resonance this . year following the deaths of PCs Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes who were . shot dead after attending what appeared to be a routine burglary call in .

The nominated officers have been invited to a lunch time reception at Downing Street before the awards ceremony in the City of London later on Thursday, which will be attended by Home Secretary Theresa May. David Cameron will not be at Number 10 because he will be out of the country. One officer, PC Carl Jones, based in Wiltshire, was called to a domestic incident when the man involved suddenly pulled a gun from behind a sofa and shot at him three times. Several of the tales of bravery involve officers throwing themselves into icy water to save people from drowning, or intervening to foil armed robberies.","Christopher Price was walking back from a meeting in Hampstead, north London, when he chased two men who had robbed an old lady .

Police found a body late on Saturday in a backyard bungalow belonging to a masked gunman who is accused of setting the residence on fire before shooting five members of a Southern California family, killing a father and his 4-year-old son. An autopsy will determine whether the body is that of Desmond John Moses, 55, who investigators believe went on the early morning shooting rampage over a dispute with the victims, who live on the same property in front of him, Inglewood Police Lt. James Madia said. Investigators believed Moses wore a dark cap and a white painter's mask when he entered the family's home around 4 a.m. and fired 10 times. Horrific: Five people were shot, two of them fatally, when a man wearing a painter's mask opened fire on a home in Inglewood before setting it ablaze . Possible motive: Police say the gunman may have lived in the back home on the property, but was recently evicted . A manhunt for Moses will continue until the body is identified, he added. Madia said Moses lived in the bungalow for 17 years, while the family lived in the front house for 8 years. The 30-year-old father was shielding two of his children when he was shot, Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said, and his 28-year-old wife was shot in both legs but managed to carry the wounded 4-year-old out of the house. Paramedics found her collapsed on the street. The other victims included the couple's six-year-old son and a seven-year-old daughter, who was struck in the chest. An eight-year-old boy who was also inside the house was the only one to escape injury. All the injured victims were rushed to University of California Medical Center, where the father died in surgery. The four-year-old boy was also pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the head. 'The father was found draped over two of the children, shielding them,' Fronterotta said. The six-year-old boy was listed in stable condition, while the mother and daughter were critical. Victims: A 28-year-old woman was shot in the pelvis and knee while she carried her wounded daughter out of the house . Rapid response: A SWAT team arrived on the scene after getting reports that the shooter may still be inside the burning home . Inferno: Firefighters were kept from the burning duplex for fear that the suspect may have barricaded himself inside . Initially it was reported that the suspect set fire to the victims' house and the dwelling in the rear of the property after gunning down the family, but later police established that he set the buildings ablaze first. Police kept fire crews away from the . burning home due to concerns that the gunman was still inside or hiding . nearby in the bushes, KCAL reported. But at around 8.30am, they were allowed to . approach the residence and managed to extinguish the flames. Five . homes in the immediate area have been evacuated and other residents . were asked to stay away as officers scoured the neighborhood in search . of the gunman. Aftermath: Inglewood emergency personnel respond to the scene of the deadly shooting in Inglewood . Manhunt: Police have found the body of the man they believe carried out the attacks, but they will continue to search until it has formally been identified . The Los Angeles Times reported that the gunman had known the family for at least eight years, according to Capt. Tom Richards of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Neighbor Aileen Ramirez, 11, told the Times that she was awakened before dawn by 'really, really loud gunshots and screaming. Somebody was yelling: ""Help me!"" I ran outside with my mother and saw the house burning down,' Ramirez said. Aileen’s brother, Yesualdo Ramirez, 20, described the children targeted in the attack as 'happy kids' who enjoyed playing soccer. Judy Castellanos, whose daughter is . related to the 30-year-old victim, described the suspected killer to the .

Shamed security firm staff have been caught downing Champagne at a £650-a-night hotel just months after the company's failure to provide workers for the Olympics forced the Government to bring in the army. More than 300 staff members from Olympics security firm G4S gathered at an upmarket hotel and spa to celebrate the 'Security Guard of the Year 2012' on Thursday evening.

Party: The party went on until the early hours before the staff retired to their rooms, which can cost £650 a night . Embrace: The party was held to celebrate the achievements of security staff and had a free bar . Plush: G4S also paid for entertainment and a formal dinner for staff . Party-goers enjoy a drink outside the hotel. G4S signed a £284million contract to provide 10,400 Games security guards, but just 16 days before the opening ceremony it admitted it had only fulfilled 83 per cent of contracted shifts . Those who attended enjoyed caviar, prime fillet steak and some of the hotel's hand-made cheeses as part of the black tie event, which is held annually to celebrate the achievements of staff. The party-goers danced and drank until 1am before continuing in the hotel bar. G4S won a £284million order to provide 10,400 security staff for the Olympic events this summer, but two weeks before the opening, thousands of British soldiers had to be drafted in after the company failed to recruit enough staff.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:40 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:42 EST, 23 October 2012 . Major General Jonathan Shaw said a rush for economic growth was putting Britain's cyber security at risk . Britain’s national security is being put at risk because a Chinese telecoms giant is being given too much access, the former head of the Minister of Defence’s cyber security unit warned. Major General Jonathan Shaw claimed ministers were ‘compromising’ on security and ‘dealing with the devil’ in opening up to the firm Huawei. A former assistant chief of defence staff, he had specific responsibility for cyber security at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for more than three years until April. This month a US congressional report published earlier this month that raised security concerns about Huawei and another Chinese telecoms company, ZTE. Major General Shaw told investigative website Exaro: ‘The economy is in such a mess that the government feels that it has to compromise on security in favour of continued economic freedom. ‘So, it is dealing with the devil and I think that the government is very conscious of that now. ‘Certainly there are enough people in the [intelligence] agencies who are saying that, but they are also aware of the economic cost of not dealing with Huawei. ‘The concern over corporate espionage is a bit like global warming. It is not today’s issue. But, by God, it is there.' Major General Shaw said working with Huawei was like 'dealing with the devil' Earlier this month it emerged Huawei, which has been accused of posing . a threat to America's national security, was being investigated over a . controversial £2.5 billion deal with British Telecom. ‘There is the very real fear that the extent of Huawei’s current telecoms penetration could mean that in the long term we shall have lost so much intellectual property by the time we put our house in order that there will be no economy left to recover.’ Australia blocked Huawei bidding for a government contract this year, citing national security, and Canada is said to be considering following suit.Huawei first entered the UK in 2001, and has invested especially heavily in the country since 2005. Last September Prime Minister David Cameron hosted Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, a former People’s Army officer, to Downing Street. Later Huawei announced plans to invest a further £1.3billion in the UK. David Cameron met Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei last month . Larry Wortzel, a member of the US-China economic and security review commission, a US congressional body, said: ‘Any government should have substantial concerns about the activities of Huawei.’ Two years ago Huawei built an ‘evaluation centre’ in Banbury, Oxfordshire which is run with UK intelligence agency GCHQ. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘The evaluation centre obviously works very closely with UK government security specialists, and that allows us to satisfy ourselves that the equipment coming into the UK meets our standards.’ A Huawei spokesman told Exaro: ‘We have been subject to UK government scrutiny and procedure since we opened our first office here in 2001. 'We have regular contact with the UK government and welcome all discussions and questions.’","Major General Jonathan Shaw accuses ministers of 'dealing with the devil'

Samantha Brick caused a stir when she declared that she is hated by other women for her beauty, but the Daily Mail journalist, who became the fourth person to be evicted from Celebrity Big Brother last Friday, says her experience on the show has only strengthened her views on the subject. The 41-year-old insists that the fact that all of the evictees from the series so far have been women, proves her point that females are often against each other. ‘Women don’t like each other very much,’ she said during an interview on Celebrity Big Brother’s Bit On The Side. You've been evicted! Samantha Brick leaves the Celebrity Big Brother house . Goodbyes: Samantha says farewell to the Celebrity Big Brother house on Friday . ‘The fact is, there were seven women in that house and now there are just two. Had we bonded together and formed a clique like the guys have done, there would still be seven of us in there and just two guys. ‘But the guys are smart, they grouped together and had each other’s back.’ Reality TV star Jasmine Lennard, glamour model Rhian Sugden, Samantha and lingerie model Danica Thrall have all exited the Channel 5 show, meaning Coronation Street star Julie Goodyear and Loose Women presenter Coleen Nolan are the only females remaining. She says that many of the male housemates, particularly comedian Julian Clary and Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp, have been flying under the radar in the house, saving their best lines for the diary room. ‘The guys are like extinct volcanoes,’ she added. ‘Martin just works on his sun tan, and Julian sits there looking bored out of his mind. Except when they get to the diary room and it all explodes!’ High praise: Samantha looked up to housemate Julie Goodyear . Thought you were beautiful? Samantha was forced to wear warts on her face and a bald wig during a task . Samantha, who lives in France with her husband Pascal, is desperate to be a mother and has recently been undergoing IVF treatment. She admits that she enjoyed mothering younger housemates such as Olympian Ashley McKenzie and Jersey Shore star Michael Sorrentino. Baby plans: Samantha and her husband Pascal are hoping to conceive a child with the help of IVF treatment . ‘People have commented on the fact that I was like a mother figure in the house and that I looked after all the young ones like they were my own and I really liked that,’ she said in a recent interview. ‘I think there is no shame in saying I would like to be domestic or a good housewife as a career choice and maybe that’s what I’d like to do next. ‘I loved it when people called me mum in the house, as that’s my biggest aspiration right now.‘ . During her time in the house, Samantha was particularly critical of Danica and Rhian, who she accused of emotionally manipulating the male housemates. But she says her opinion of Julian has changed considerably now that she’s had time to watch episodes of the show . ‘He’s a misogynistic snob isn’t he?’ she exclaimed. ‘He doesn’t like women. He doesn’t like working class people. He doesn’t like my accent. I don’t think I could ever have won him round.’ One housemate Samantha is full of praise for is Julie, and she admits she was stunned to hear the eviction crowd shouting ‘Get Julie out! on Friday evening. ‘She’s a 70-year-old woman, she is registered disabled,’ says Samantha. ‘She talks about everyone behind their backs, but so does everyone else. ‘ . The remaining housemates have turned against Julie in the last few days, and the pensioner reacted badly when she discovered that she was up for eviction, along with Martin and Prince Lorenzo. ‘The problem is, the guys are really clever, as is Coleen,’ says Samantha.  ‘Julie is the strongest housemate and they want her out.’ Samantha also insisted that she had no regrets about the article that brought her into the spotlight. Women in the firing line: Samantha was up for eviction along with Danica Thrall and Coleen Nolan . Teary: Samantha became emotional when she discovered she was up for eviction . ‘That story I wrote in April was my idea,’ she said. ‘It came about when I noticed one of my female neighbours consistently ignoring me and it stemmed from there. ‘I was made to feel that she not only didn’t like me but also that she didn’t want me in her social circle at all, purely because she felt threatened and thought I might fancy her husband. ‘Well, that made me angry and I thought I would write down the very thing that I know lots of women have experienced but are too scared to say out loud.’","Writer dubs Julian Clary a 'misogynistic snob'

"PUBLISHED: . 04:17 EST, 28 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:00 EST, 28 July 2012 . With its pastoral scenes, tributes to the NHS and Great Ormond Street, dark, satanic mills, references to James Bond, yellow submarines and Mary Poppins, last night's spectacular Opening Ceremony was certainly very British. With an eclectic soundtrack featuring orchestral through to punk, stopping at Dizzee Rascal on the way, it was at times quite literally Bonkers. It was almost as if Danny Boyle was putting on a show for the Brits, rather than the rest of the world, so what did the rest of the world make of it? Well, more than a billion apparently tuned in and the response was pretty mixed. The Queen's cameo appearance was a . particular highlight for the non-British audience as she took part in a . comical segment filmed in Buckingham Palace with Daniel Craig, before . seemingly parachuting into the Olympic Stadium with the James Bond star. But some of the more obscure references left many scratching their heads. Larger than life: A grotesque giant puppet of Alice In Wonderland's Queen of Hearts pokes through a huge hospital bed during the extravagant NHS tribute segment . 'Quirky': The New York Times called it a 'noisy, busy, witty, dizzying production' 'Kaleidoscopic': China Daily celebrated a show it said highlighted Britain's 'grandeur and eccentricities' Low point: The LA Times, whose sports reporter said she was 'baffled' by the NHS segment . The world is watching: Spain's El Pais, calling London 'the centre of the world' Los Angeles Times sports reporter Bill Plaschke tweeted: 'James Bond and Queen Elizabeth II 'parachute' into the stadium, then kids in pyjamas sing the national anthem... works for me.' Another LA Times reporter, who tweeted shortly after Harry Potter author JK Rowling read from Peter Pan, said: 'The Queen acting, JK Rowling reading in public, can you top this?' The appearance of Mr Bean also got viewers from the other side of the Atlantic chuckling, with Rowan Atkinson's comical character seeming to go down well with the American press. Mr Plaschke tweeted: 'Mr Bean hams it up during playing of Chariots of Fire... hilarious.. this is becoming can't-miss ceremony.' A fellow LA Times reporter wrote: 'Rowan Atkinson segment, very clever.' Grand entrance: The 'Queen' parachuting into the stadium was a highlight for amused viewers . Send in the clown: Rowan Atkinson's appearance went down a storm thanks to the international appeal of his Mr Bean character . The Mail's own Jan Moir called it 'the barmiest Opening Ceremony in Olympic history, an explosion of nonsense and tremendous good fun' - despite it being 'a bit tinky winky and laa-la at times'.Boyle's masterpiece received a five-star rave from the Guardian, which hailed it as 'the biggest, maddest, weirdest, most heartfelt and lovable dream sequence in British cinema history'.The Daily Telegraph saw it as 'breathtakingly politically charged' in comparison to previous opening ceremonies, saying that it was 'about punk rather than pomp'. And although 'utterly compelling', the paper's critic wrote, 'the show periodically lost focus combined sometimes with an almost baffling level of visual detail'. For the Mirror, it was 'a celebration of our genius, tolerance, humour, and all we have given to the world', adding that 'it was hard to think of any British icon it didn’t reference'. Another wrote: 'Mr Bean one of the night's scripted surprises.' The ceremony's showcasing of Britain's rich musical history was another highlight with the use of songs from UK's finest singers and performers seeming to be a massive hit. KC Johnson from the Chicago Tribune tweeted: 'The Jam has been played. I can go home now. Oh, wait, Arctic Monkeys and Sir Paul still to come. Musical heaven.' Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times journalist Philip Hersh tweeted: 'Did MTV produce this?' He also heaped praise on the upbeat nature of the athletes' parade. 'This parade of athletes has much more of a party atmosphere than in past... feels like closing ceremony mood,' he said. The cinematic element of the ceremony was singled out, with the New York Times describing the show as 'visually stunning'. But some segments of the showpiece seemed to be lost on particular viewers. Los Angeles Times sports writer Diane Pucin said: 'For the life of me, though, am still baffled by NHS tribute at opening ceremonies. Like tribute to United Health Care or something in US.' The fact the Olympic torch was lit by a number of young athletes seemed unpopular with some. 'Musical heaven': Sir Paul McCartney tops off a tuneful few hours, which led one US journalist to ask 'Did MTV produce this?' Lost on some: Dancers dressed as nurses in the NHS and Great Ormond Street Hospital tribute scene, which meant little to much of the international audience . Star of the show: Italy's La Stampa, whose headline reads 'for one night, the Queen becomes a Bond Girl' Spectacular: France's Liberation emblazoned its front page with the rings dripping with sparks . Mr Plaschke tweeted: 'Very symbolic ending, but sort of anticlimatic... I like my cauldron lit by one person... and a person people have heard of.' John Cherwa from the LA Times wrote: 'Hated the flame lighting. Just make a decision and pick someone.' The decision to ask former Beatle Paul McCartney to sing out the ceremony was well received. David Haugh from the Chicago Tribune said: 'McCartney can still bring it... Na, na, na, na, na,na, na, na... show ending appropriately on a high after confusing cauldron lighting.' Australian journalist Karen Tighe said that Boyle had 'hit the nail on the head' with the opening ceremony. The Perth-based ABC Sports presenter told BBC Radio 5Live: 'It was a fantastic start to the Games. I'm so glad there was no temptation to be better and bigger than Beijing - it was wonderful in its own way and it all came across so well.' She added: 'Visually it looked spectacular, there was humour and the overall picture - I think he (Boyle) hit the nail on the head.' Mrs Tighe said the length of the show was a negative point and also expressed disappointment over the lighting of the cauldron. Who? The decision to have seven unknown young athletes light the flame was seen by some as a cop-out and an anti-climax . 'British fancifulness': An army of actresses dressed as Mary Poppins float across the arena . 'I really loved the inspiration of a new generation, but it kind of felt a bit of an anti-climax at that point.' Meanwhile, The New York Times described the 'hilariously quirky' celebration as a 'noisy, busy, witty, dizzying production'. It added: 'Britain presented itself to the world Friday night as something it has often struggled to express even to itself: a nation secure in its own post-empire identity, whatever that actually is.' The LA Times also heaped further praise on the occasion. It said in a review of the ceremony: 'An atmosphere of whimsy and party won out over pomp and circumstance during an Olympic opening ceremony that allowed an economically beleaguered Britain to pat itself on the back. 'The ceremony could not have been more of a contrast from Beijing's four years ago, replacing Chinese militaristic precision with British fancifulness.' The Times of India called the ceremony 'dazzling', adding that London had 'presented a vibrant picture of Great Britain's rich heritage and culture'. For the Hindu, another of India's biggest papers, it was a 'cultural tour de force',  while the input of composer AR Rahman, who scored Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire, was said to celebrate 'the Indian influences on the UK'. Meanwhile the China Daily said the pageant was 'kaleidoscopic'. 'Britain's Queen Elizabeth declared the London Olympics open after playing a cameo role in a dizzying ceremony designed to highlight the grandeur and eccentricities of the nation that invented modern sport,' it said.

'This outcome is the result of a significant investigation by GMP's Robbery Unit into those intent on planning and executing high value robberies, in a sophisticated manner, where victims are left feeling terrified.'

Health fears: Michael Jackson's former doctor Conrad Murray was rushed to hospital over fears he could suffer blood clots . The doctor jailed for the involuntary manslaughter of Michael Jackson has been rushed to hospital over fears he could suffer fatal blood clots in his legs because of the cramped conditions of his prison cell. Conrad Murray, 59, who is serving a four-year sentence at Los Angeles County Jail, claims that living in a 5ft by 7ft cell is slowly 'killing him'. Murray, who stands 6ft 5ins tall, is housed in a segregation block away from the prison's general population over fears he could be attacked. According to his lawyers he is allowed two hours exercise in a rooftop 'cage' every Monday. His lawyer Michael Flanagan told the New York Daily News: 'He’s being housed like a piece of veal. 'He can't even do jumping jacks in his cell. The bed takes up three feet, and there's a toilet in there too. It's awful what they're doing to him.' Mr Flanagan has sent a letter to Los Angeles County jail officials claiming Murray is suffering slow blood flow in his lower extremities as well as right shoulder pain and a general loss of mobility. The letter state that the symptoms put him at high risk of deep vein thrombosis, which could lead to permanent damage or even death. The letter adds: 'Death or injury at the hands of another prisoner … is no worse than a slow death caused by a loss of circulation and atrophy resulting from inhumane confinement of a large man in a tiny space.'

An emotional Ann Romney has revealed the personal and private homage her husband Mitt will perform before his first presidential debate with Barack Obama this evening. Tearing up, Ann Romney said that when the Republican candidate arrives at his podium, he will remove his watch, place it to one side and then simply write 'Dad' on a piece of paper in front of him to remember his late father and former Michigan governor George Romney. Explaining that her husband does this each time he prepares to enter a political debate, Ann Romney said that the Republican candidate would then look out into the crowd for her, unable to feel secure unless he had caught her eye. Scroll Down for Video . Speaking to CNN, Ann Romney revealed that her husband has a three part ritual that he goes through before he is ready to speak in a political debate . 'As soon as he gets on stage...he takes off his watch and puts it on the podium...then he writes 'Dad' on the piece of paper,' said Ann Romney to CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. 'And that's amazing, because he loves his dad, respects his Dad. Doesn't want to do anything that would not make his father proud... I love the fact that Mitt does that. So he writes that.' 'And then he looks in the audience and he finds me. He has to find where I am. 'And– he just– he needs just that connection. And almost after every answer that he gives, he'll find me in the audience, to see, 'Was that good? Was that okay?' Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, speaks to supporters at a campaign event at Hudson Gardens and Event Center in Littleton, Colorado on Tuesday 2nd of October . During the interview, Mrs. Romney said that her family has given her the nickname, 'the Mitt Stabilizer.' 'I'm there for him. We're there for each other emotionally all the time,' said Mrs. Romney. 'In the last 20 debates that we did in the primary– I felt that was my most important role. 'There's an emotional connection that's happening between the two of us during the debate itself.' And as her husband prepares for the most important public political debate of his career, Mrs. Romney said that the only advice she has given him is to be himself. 'He has to feel what he's gotta say, when he's gotta say it,' said Mrs. Romney. 'He's gotta listen to his own instincts. And of course it's– he's gonna be getting a lot of advice. 'But he's gotta listen to his own instincts more than anyone else's and trust that.' Gov.

Mitt Romney (centre) with Texas Gov. Rick Perry (left), and Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN - right) as the participate in the Fox News/Google GOP Debate at the Orange County Convention Center on September 22, 2011 in Orlando, Florida . Speaking up for her husband, who is notorious for his stilted public persona, Mrs. Romney has emerged as his character witness and defender in chief. She admonishes her husband's Republican critics, and tries to convince women that Mitt Romney is on their side. She also counters the portrait her husband's opponent paints of a soul-less corporate raider, and seeks to show his softer side, like she did Tuesday when she recalled how he made regular visits in the 1970s to a 14-year-old who was dying of cancer, even helping the boy write his will. 'That is where Mitt is when someone's in trouble, he's there, he's by the bedside,' Ann Romney told a crowd at a park in this vote-rich area as her husband stayed out of sight ahead of Wednesday's debate. 'Right now the country's in trouble. We need someone who cares, who truly understands what is going on.' Michelle Obama told CNN that she never offers her husband any advice before a speech or debate adding that she feels he knows what he is doing by now . Her biggest appearance to date came at the GOP convention in Tampa, Fla., as she spoke in greatly personal details about the man she's been married to for four decades - and made a direct pitch to a group of voters with whom Obama has an edge in polling. 'I love you women! And I hear your voices,' she said, delivering a forceful defense of her husband's character and values in a speech designed to introduce the country to the man she knows better than anyone. In Denver on Tuesday, a KUSA-TV viewer asked whether she and her husband really have a finger on pulse of Americans if they've never struggled. 'Struggle is an interesting thing,' Ann Romney responded. 'I can tell you Mitt and I have struggled a great deal, that we can understand people who are going through difficulties right now because we have gone through our own personal hardships. Malia Obama, (left) Sasha Obama, and First lady Michelle Obama listen as Democratic presidential candidate, U.S. President Barack Obama speaks on stage during the final day of the Democratic National Convention . 'You don't have to struggle in exactly the same way to have compassion for others. And if you look at the measure of who he is, how generous he has been his entire life and helping others, you have to know that this guy does care.' And as both candidates keep low profiles before Wednesday evening's debates, Michelle Obama has revealed the worries that she goes through watching her husband speak.

'I'm like one of those parents watching their kid on the balance beam. You're just standing there trying not to you know, have any expression at all.' Revealing that she offers him little advice beforehand, Mrs. Obama said that afterwards she only offers, 'positive reinforcement.' 'He doesn't need much advice,' she said. 'He's a very good debater, so I do tell him to have fun and relax and just be himself.'","Spoke of her husband's pre-debate ritual which he will follow this evening as he spars with Obama during the first presidential debate .

"By . Paul Revoir . PUBLISHED: . 08:26 EST, 20 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:25 EST, 20 October 2012 . A senior journalist who was part of the original Newsnight expose into Jimmy Saville child-abuse allegations warned the BBC director general not to cover-up why the report was dropped. The leaked email suggests BBC chief George Entwistle ignored a pressing plea . from investigative  reporter Liz MacKean, about . his ‘misleading statements’ regarding the content of the cancelled programme. He declined to speak to Ms MacKean about the matter despite her urgent email sent 12 days ago but has since spoken to senior BBC management about her version of events. Jimmy Savile has been described as one of the most prolific child sex abusers of all time . More than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the TV star . In the email to the director general, seen by The Independent, . she said: ‘Worst of all has been what seems like a concerted effort to . make it appear that our story was about something else, something that . could be dropped and forgotten ahead of fulsome tribute programmes. 'It is this which seems to be fuelling the damaging claims of a cover-up.’ The damaging leaked email comes ahead of a Panorama investigation into Jimmy Savile, due to air . on Monday, which is expected to look into why the BBC dropped its . original Newsnight report on the TV star last year. But Mr . Entwistle has refused to be interviewed for the programme - citing legal . advice that he should restrict his statements to the police, official . inquiries and a commons committee hearing on Tuesday. MPs are now demanding that every BBC email linked to the decision by Newsnight to drop an investigation into Jimmy Savile’s abuse of teenage girls should be made public. Correspondence leading all the way to the top of the corporation should be disclosed in a bid to retain public trust, they insisted. It follows the emergence of a leaked e-mail which appears to cast more doubt on the BBC’s stated reason on why the current affairs show dropped the programme. Newsnight reporter Liz MacKean, right, emailed former Newsnight editor and new director genereal George Entwistle warning him about cover-up surrounding the cancelled programme . The memo suggests Newsnight journalists had been ‘focusing on allegations of abuse’ rather than, as has been claimed was the case by the BBC, on the allegation of a failure by police to look into the case properly. The email from a press officer shows that, by December 7 last year, the BBC was at an advanced enough stage to be readying ‘lines to take’ when questioned about the planned broadcast. It reveals that the BBC was conscious that it would create difficult questions about why the corporation had not investigated the star when he was alive. In the email, the press officer admits that ‘we may well need to do a bit of managing around this’. There were also growing calls last night for the BBC’s director of news Helen Boaden to appear in front of MPs to give her version of events. While much of the attention has focused on Mr Entwistle and what he knew, insiders have pointed out that the prime focus should instead be on Miss Boaden. Jimmy Savile pictured during a visit at Stoke Manderville Hospital , where a number of former patients have come forward to complain of sexual abuse . The former DJ and TV presenter was said to have selected his victims before inviting them backstage where he abused them . Unlike Mr Entwistle, she is said to have known the outline of what was in the Newsnight investigation. MPs are questioning why she had not used her knowledge of the allegations to get the BBC to pull the Savile tribute programmes last Christmas. Last night MPs called for all relevant emails to be published. This could include any messages sent between Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, deputy director of news Stephen Mitchell and Miss Boaden. Tory MP Rob Wilson, who received the leaked email from a BBC insider, has been tirelessly campaigning to get to the bottom of the Newsnight case. He said: ‘I think at some point certainly all the internal evidence that is collected should be published as part of any report in the same way a select committee would do that.’ MPs have called for the BBC's director of news Helen Boaden, pictured, to answer questions from the select committee . Conservative MP, John Whittingdale, who chairs the culture, media and sport select committee, said in order to ‘restore credibility’ all ‘relevant evidence’, such as emails, should be made public. But he added this should be done as part of Nick Pollard’s BBC independent inquiry into Newsnight. Another select committee member Tory MP, Philip Davies, said: ‘I think the BBC may well have to [publish the emails] because I think they are in a very serious situation. ‘Again it comes back to the point that this is their phone-hacking moment and it will get to a stage where people will want to see what the evidence is to make up their own mind.’ MPs also said Miss Boaden may in the . coming weeks have to appear in front the culture, media and sport select . committee which is quizzing Mr Entwistle about the Savile scandal on . Tuesday. Mr Wilson . said: ‘There are questions whichever way you look at it. 'If George . Entwistle’s version of events is correct then it means Helen Boaden knew . that there were issues to do with the transmission of the Savile . tribute programmes because she knew that there was a Jimmy Savile . investigation going on.’ He . said presuming she had known about the content he questioned why she . had not thought it ‘completely inappropriate’ to let the Savile tribute . shows go out. The MP added: ‘I have already written to John Whittingdale suggesting that he may wish to call both Rippon, Newsnight reporters and Boaden before him.’ Mr Whittingdale has said his committee would ‘reserve the right’ to call other people in if there were still questions to be answered. A BBC spokesman said of the press office email: ‘This ridiculous story in no way casts doubt on what the BBC has previously said on this. It is simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the Newsnight producer asking for further information about the Jimmy Savile investigation.’","Senior reporter Liz MacKean warned BBC chief George Entwistle about a cover-up at the BBC .

A schoolboy died when a rusty goalpost fell on top of him during a football game with his friends, an inquest heard today. Casey Breese was goalkeeping when the studs of his football boot were caught in the net and in his attempts to free himself, the young boy brought the heavy metal construction over himself. The 11-year-old Manchester United fan was playing with his friends in Caersws village, near Newtown in Powys when tragedy struck. His friends witnessed how Casey came out from under the rusty bar and said he had trouble breathing. Casey was airlifted to hospital but died of hepatic trauma as a result of a crush injury, the inquest in Welshpool, Mid-Wales was told. George Clarke, 13, said ‘Casey was in goal when he went to make a save. ‘I saw Casey falling on his stomach with the bar landing on his back.’ George’s twin brother Edward said: ‘Casey jumped to save a shot but got his foot caught in the net. ‘The post fell over on him. Casey was on his stomach but he sat up and said he couldn’t breathe. His eyes were rolling.’ The metal posts were 20 years old, poorly maintained and had no restraining devices to prevent them from falling. The inquest heard the net was not weighed down and was hanging close to the goal line where Casey was standing. His friend Keiron Beaton, 15, said: ‘He tried to get his foot loose and pulled the goal down onto himself.’ All the boys gave written evidence . after the coroner ruled it would be too traumatic for them to attend the . inquest into their friend’s death. Tribute: Flowers and football kits have been left at the scene at Caersws football club where Casey Breese was fatally injured . Old equipment: The goals at Caersws football club Casey and his friends used were 20 years old, rusty and poorly maintained . His heartbroken parents Shan and Nick had earlier paid tribute to their ‘full of fun’ son. They said: ‘Casey was a lively, energetic lad, full of fun, and was loved by all in the community. ‘So many friends and members of the community remember Casey and he will be sadly missed by all.’ Pc Andrew Jones of Powys Police told . the hearing there had been a previous incident when the goalpost fell . down after a boy was swinging on the crossbar. The officer confirmed to the hearing there were no restraining devices to stop the post from falling over. The local welder who made the goal posts 20 years ago told the inquest the construction would be unstable unless pegged to the ground. Ivor Lloyd, who also designed the goal himself, said: 'The posts had base plates which were secured to the ground using pegs.' 'I made them roughly twenty years ago but they are mine - you recognise your own work.' The inquest heard there was no health and safety risk assessment carried out on the posts either by the Caersws recreation association or by the village football club. The posts were paid for and commissioned by a local benefactor Gareth Williams who is known as 'Mr Football', were so heavy it took up to six men to carry them. The . goalposts were taken away from the village recreation ground as part of . an investigation by police and the Health and Safety Executive. The inquest continues.

Lucky: Sam Clarke, 19, miraculously survived after he was catapulted more than 100ft through the air when a lorry collided with his car - and he didn't even break a bone . A teenager miraculously survived after he was catapulted more than 100ft through the air when a lorry collided with his car - and he didn't even break a bone. The horrific accident happened after Sam Clarke, 19, had broken down on the A46 near Cossington, Leicestershire. After managing to pull over his Range Rover, he got out of the vehicle. But seconds later the teenager was hurled through the air after a huge 42-tonne lorry clipped the tail of his car sending it smashing into him. Incredibly Mr Clarke, who works for British Waterways, escaped death with just two black eyes, a sore knee and bruising all over his body. He was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary last Thursday after the crash at 8.10pm and remarkably just needed a few stitches to a gash on his head. And just 18 hours after his car was hit by the juggernaut Mr Clarke was back on his feet and walking out of the hospital. He said there wasn't much he could remember about the crash except standing on the passenger side of his Range Rover. He said: 'I remember standing there and then I was pretty much knocked out straight away, I was thrown down the banking and landed in a hedge. 'I suppose it is pretty amazing that I didn't break anything, I guess the hedge softened my fall. 'My bosses have been really good to me and the doctors said it would take six weeks to heal properly but I reckon I'll be fine in three.' His mum, Caroline Chettle, said it was a miracle Mr Clarke escaped with just a bad cut to his head, a sore knee and bruising. She said: 'Everyone we spoke to who was involved in helping him said it was a miracle he was alive. 'We are in shock at the moment. The thought of what could have been - it's devastating. It sounds dramatic, but I want people who helped him to know we are thankful and know how lucky he was. 'He was so close to death, yet he is with us. Somehow, 18 hours after a 42-tonne lorry crashed into him and his car, he was walking out of the hospital on crutches. It is a miracle.' Mr Clarke, from Hinckley,  Leicestershire, was driving to his girlfriend's house when his vehicle broke down. He got out to look under the bonnet and had walked round to the passenger side of the car when the crash happened. Mrs Chettle said: 'If he was under the bonnet at the time he would have been killed instantly. Destroyed: The teenager broke down on the A46 but after getting out of his Range Rover he was hurled through the air after a huge 42-tonne lorry clipped the tail of his car. The wreckage is pictured . 'He remembers bits and pieces. He thinks he was unconscious for five or 10 minutes. People had seen that someone had been with the car before the crash so they were searching for him. He started shouting when he woke up and they found him. 'They were searching for other bodies because he could not make any sense - he could not tell them if anyone else had been in the car with him. 'If his girlfriend and her three-year-old girl had been in the car they could have been killed. 'The whole thing was a wreck - a total write off - the back of the car was in the front seat. I think the fact that it was a Range Rover he was driving saved his life. 'It weighs three tonne. If it had been a little car he would not have had a chance because it would have crumpled over him. But instead it took a lot of the crash.' Relieved: Mr Clarke is pictured with his mother Caroline Cheshire . Mrs Chettle, 49, said her son was allowed home on Friday afternoon. She said: 'We want to say thank-you to everyone who helped him. 'The people who stopped and calmed him down and tried to stop the bleeding, the ambulance, the police - everyone. The staff at the hospital did an amazing job, too. 'We don't blame the lorry driver at all. He was devastated himself. He had not seen the car in time and, when he did, he did his best to stop. It was an accident.' Tim Coats, professor of emergency medicine at Leicester Royal Infirmary, who helped treat Sam, said: 'I am pleased that Sam was very lucky and only came away with minor injuries.'","The horrific accident happened after Sam Clarke, 19, had broken down on the A46 near Cossington, Leicestershire .

He said at a press conference: 'At this point, we don't have any person of interest. There have been no arrests,' and pointed out this was a very rare case for the area which is considered safe. Autumn . was reported missing from her home on Saturday evening, . and had been the subject of a large search over the last two days until her body was found last night. An . autopsy to further confirm the body's identity will be conducted this . morning by the Gloucester County Medical Examiner's office. Dalton said: 'This is a very sad . day for the Pasquale family. Our hearts go out to the family and to all . the residents of Clayton who stood together in support of this young . girl.' About 200 law enforcement officials and hundreds more volunteers searched for Autumn yesterday. Dalton yesterday said that 75 people had been interviewed in connection with what-was-then a missing person case. Just before 4pm yesterday, investigators entered a house behind a Franklin Township bar after a K-9 dog supposedly picked up a scent. The owner told the Daily News he got a call from police at work in Mount Laurel and was asked to come home. 'They said they wanted to search my house,' the man said. Though they left 20 minutes later with nothing, the man said he had nothing to hide but understood why he might be considered suspicious as his back window was recently broken and he is friends with a lot of young girls on Facebook because of his teenage sister. At that point on Monday afternoon Investigators did not . have any suspects or a sure sense of whether Autumn was left on her own or was the victim of foul play. Her parents - Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell - did not . speak at the news conference. Both wept during the evening vigil. Waiting: The community gathers near the spot where the body of the missing 12-year-old is believed to have been found in a recycling bin . Grim discovery: Gloucester County prosecutors say a body believed to be that of Autumn Pasquale was found around 10pm yesterday in the bin just blocks from her house . Volunteer: John Reed spent yesterday handing out fliers to passers-by in case someone had seen Autumn . Search: Flanked by Autumn's mother Jennifer Cornwall, Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean Dalton offers a $10,000 reward for information about her whereabouts - just hours before the girl's body was found . Autumn, whose 13th birthday would have been next Monday, was last . seen around 12.30pm on Saturday pedaling her white bicycle away from the . Clayton home where she lives with her father, her two siblings, her . father's girlfriend and the girlfriend's children. A . friend, DeAnna Edwards-McMillen, 11, said Autumn was at her . house on Friday night and they exchanged text messages on Saturday. She . said she received the last one at 1.22pm and didn't believe it was . intended for her. She said it read, 'don't be like that'. DeAnna . said her friend was nice and easy to be around: 'She didn't hate . people and . people didn't hate her.' DeAnna's mother, Debi McMillen, said that Autumn was often at their house and that she always went home before her 8pm curfew. The . last known communication was in a text message she sent at around 2.30pm. Mr Dalton would not say who received . the message or what it contained, but he added that there was nothing . alarming or unusual about it. It . wasn't until about 9.30pm that she was reported missing - 90 minutes . past her 8pm curfew, said Paul Spadofora, a family spokesman, the uncle . of Autumn's father and the girl's godfather. Schoolgirl: Autumn was reported missing from her Clayton home on Saturday evening . Appeal: Since Autumn went missing at the weekend, pictures and fliers have been passed around Clayton in the hope of finding her until her uncle confirmed it was her body found . Hunt: Local volunteers gather on Sunday to organise search parties for Autumn . Mr Dalton said 50 county and local law enforcement officers were on the case shortly after she was reported missing. By . Monday, the number grew fourfold as FBI and state police got involved . in a search that has employed helicopters, horses, bloodhounds and . computer experts. Mr Dalton said . investigators accounted for all the registered sex offenders in the . area, interviewed them and were searching their properties. The . weary crew of volunteers, meanwhile, was looking in area malls, handing . out fliers at intersections in Clayton's tiny downtown and searching . wherever they could. Early yesterday, Mr Weisenfeld said the girl's bike had not been found. By the . afternoon, Mr Dalton would not say whether it had been located.

Donald Trump, the American property tycoon, has described plans to create a new wind farm off the Scottish coast as 'financial suicide'. He made the damning claims in a submission to a Scottish parliamentary committee looking into the proposals for 11 giant turbines off the Aberdeenshire coast. Mr Trump said: 'Your pristine countryside and coastlines will forever be destroyed and Scotland will go broke.' He added that building 'these industrial monstrosities' would 'completely end' tourism in the country. Mr Trump has previously raised fears the wind farm would spoil the view from his new £750million golfing resort in Aberdeenshire. Work has been suspended on the luxury development near Menie, north of Aberdeen, because of the offshore wind farm threat. He said: 'If I had known about the current wind turbine proposals, I would never have built in Scotland.' Mr Trump is next due to appear in person before MSPs next week to further push his case. Despite his concern a second written submission said there should be a 'major shift' in energy policy towards offshore wind farms. Ramblers Scotland said in a written submission to Holyrood's Energy Committee that there was too much focus on land-based wind farms. The submission said: 'Government policy is focusing too much on supporting renewable electricity generation through one technology - large-scale, land-based wind turbine developments. 'We believe that the present situation is seriously threatening Scotland's reputation as a country with world-famous natural beauty. Vision: How the wind farm off the Aberdeenshire coast could look . 'This is likely to significantly diminish the numbers of people who choose to come to Scotland to enjoy our scenery and outdoor recreation opportunities.' The debate follows  the Scottish Government giving the go-ahead on April 4 to a massive wind farm on the Shetland Islands. The Viking Project, will have 103 giant turbines that could provide electricity for 175,000 homes – despite Shetland only having a population of 22,000. The approval to create the third biggest wind farm in Scotland could also see the construction of a £500million cable to plug the islands into the National Grid for the first time. However, . opponents warned of an 'unimaginable' impact on world-renowned . landscape, with the £566million development set to dominate the moors . and hills. Huge: Artist impression of Viking Project wind farm from the sky and map showing its impact . The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said rare species such as whimbrels and red throated divers could be at risk. In February, more than 300 people marched through Lerwick to protest at the plans, while 2,500 residents signed a petition opposing the project. But ministers gave the go-ahead, with the wind farm crucial to their election promise to generate 100 per cent of Scotland’s electricity needs through renewables by 2020.

Not so, according to a new study, which revealed that sex, death and money are the three conversation topics guaranteed to have Brits break out in a cold sweat. Asked to rate the most uncomfortable conversation topics, more than half of those questioned said they find sex the most difficult to discuss with partners and friends. A little less conversation: More than half of British adults find talking about sex tough . Surprisingly for those who assume women . love to gossip about their bedroom antics, it was revealed the fairer . sex struggled with broaching the topic more than their male . counterparts. Death and money were second and third on . the list of taboo topics, with almost a third of those questioned . saying they couldn't bear to discuss death, and 22 per cent saying . they found probing conversations about finance excruciating. Other conversational toughies include telling your family you’re ill, letting someone know that a loved one has died, or asking a family member for money. Shockingly, those topics were considered more difficult to discuss than asking for a divorce, with just one in five claiming they would find this conversation the most difficult to initiate. Discussions about inheritance entitlement rounds out the top five most difficult chats. When it comes to financial matters, many families bury their heads in the sand, with one in 10 surveyed by Santander Insurance admitting that they were unfamiliar with their partner’s financial affairs. Only four in 10 well-informed types said they were abreast of everything.

Santander spokesman Steve Burton said: 'Despite there being numerous ways to communicate these days, people still find it tricky to talk about the ‘taboo’ subjects of sex, death and money. 'When it comes to financial matters, no one likes thinking about what may happen if a loved was to die or be diagnosed with serious illness but these difficult conversations do need to be had to ensure that family and dependents are aware of any financial provisions they can access. 'Putting steps in place to prepare can certainly help if the worst was to happen. Our research found that three in 10 people admit to having no plans or provision to secure their future financially. Yet life insurance can be relatively inexpensive, with premiums starting from as little as £5 per month, and can provide reassurance to people that their loved ones will be financially secure if they die or suffer a critical illness.'","Over half of British adults find sex the most awkward topic to discuss with partners and friends .

A 17-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the brutal murder of Colorado schoolgirl Jessica Ridgeway. Austin Reed Sigg was arrested late Tuesday night at his home near Ketner Lake Open Space after his mother tipped off police. Sigg will be charged with two counts of murder in the first degree and second-degree kidnapping as well as two counts of criminal attempts. The accused killer enjoyed forensic science and won second place in a Crime Scene Investigation competition. Some friends told the media that Sigg expressed interest in becoming a mortician. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Alleged killer: Austin Reed Sigg, 17, was arrested late Tuesday night after Westminster police received a tip that led them to a home near Ketner Lake Open Space . He will also face charges for the attempted abduction of a female jogger near Ketner Lake on May 28. Police documents state that the teen is a student at Arapahoe Community College. On March 23, he won second place in the Crime Scene Investigation division of the Health Occupation Students of America State Leadership Conference competition, according to The Denver Post. 'He was very quiet, shy and to himself. I would say he was gothic,' Brooke Olds, who has known Sigg for about nine years, told The Denver Channel. 'He never really talked about his family or his friends. Like, all he talked about was playing or spending time with us. He always wanted, just, to play capture the flag.' The teen was arrested at his home at around 7.45pm on Tuesday and Jessica's parents were notified by Westminster police this morning. 'This morning the Ridgeway family was notified of this arrest,' Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk said in a lunchtime press conference. From missing to murdered: The Colorado . schoolgirl's gruesomely dismembered body was discovered in a park 10 . miles from her home on October 11, six days after she vanished on her . way to school . 'We hope and pray this arrest gives them some measure of closure in dealing with their horrible loss and tragedy.' The boy's mother said she called . police but Sigg handed himself over to officers. A woman identifying . herself as his aunt said his mother alerted authorities after the Sigg . came to her with some 'disturbing information.' 'I made the phone call, he turned himself in. That's all I have to say,' his mother, Mindy Sigg, told The Associated Press over the phone, before she broke down in tears and hung up. A police report said Sigg was . 'cooperative' when police arrived at his house and was taken to . Westminster police department in handcuffs. He was later taken to . Mountain View Detention Facility. Authorities . said they could not release much information because Sigg is a juvenile . and the affidavits in the case have been sealed under court order. Police were today blocking access to . Sigg's home, which his just 1.4 miles from Jessica's, and a search . warrant had been served on the property, according to The Post. Investigators were also digging through the contents of a dumpster across the street from the Sigg residence and police towed away a bronze Jeep that belonged to the suspect. Hard-work: Westminster Police Chief Lee Birk, pictured during a press conference on Wednesday, praised his team and the community for their help in the case . Crowd: Members of the tight-knit Westminster community gathered to listen to the police announcement . Jessica's great-grandmother said she was thrilled police had made an arrest. 'Grateful to God that the community . pulled together and the police department didn’t quit,' said Donna Moss . told The Denver Channel. The teen will make his first court appearance at 8am tomorrow in Jefferson County. 'We . worked on this case nonstop, around the clock, since October 5, the day . of her abduction,' Birk said. 'I believe we've made a significant step . towards justice for Jessica. 'We . hope also that knowing an arrest has been made in this case can cause . our community to rest a little easier and maybe feel a little safer.' Police . revealed earlier this week the suspect in the attempted abduction was . thought to be the same man who kidnapped and murdered Jessica on October . 5. They have not revealed why they think the two cases are linked. The Colorado schoolgirl's dismembered body was found six days after she vanished on her way to school. In the abduction attempt, an . unidentified young woman was jogging around a lake about a . half-mile from the Ridgeway home when she was grabbed from behind by a man. Evidence: Police towed away Austin Sigg's car, pictured . The . attacker tried to cover her mouth with a chemical-soaked rag but she was . able to escape. According to The Post, the woman described her attacker as a . light-skinned Caucasian male between 18 and 30 years of age, 5 feet 6 to . 5 feet 8 inches tall with a medium build and brown hair. The link between the two cases was confirmed just days after police found a tuft of blonde hair a mile away . from where 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway's body was discovered. But Westminster police . investigating the murder initially dismissed claims that the hair was a . definite clue in the case. A spokesman told the Denver Post last . week that there was nothing to suggest the hair has anything to do with . Jessica or was even human. Another recent clue in the tragic . investigation was a wooden . cross which police believe belonged to Jessica's killer, describing it as a 'pivotal piece of evidence' in the case. Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 . inches tall by 1 inch wide cross and has a hole at the top so it can be worn as a . necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday. Hope gone: After the grisly discovery of Jessica's body on October 11, the search for Jessica turned into a hunt for her killer . Recent clue: Pictures of the cross, which is 1.5 . inch tall by 1 inch wide with a hole at the top so it can be worn as a . necklace, were released by Westminster Police Department on Friday . 'Authorities are looking for someone . who may carry or wear this type of cross, may have recently purchased . one of these, or is known to have some association with one,' Westminster Police Department Mr Trevor Materasso said in a statement at the time. Police were also looking for local businesses that may sell these types of crosses. The solid wood pendant has three . vertical markings etched into the horizontal bar of the cross and a . zig-zag pattern carved into the opposite side. Mr Materasso added that the item 'could become a pivotal piece of evidence that helps authorities identify and locate Jessica's killer.' Jessica was last seen beginning a . short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of . October 5. She never arrived.

He has been fighting before top judges over his multi-million pound divorce from his ex-wife Elizabeth . A multi-millionaire estate agent whose 'disastrous' divorce left him unable to afford to buy a home of his own has won a ruling that parts of a family court judgement made last year were 'too favourable' to his ex wife. Christos Malialis, 59, argued that a £1.45million payout was handed to his ex-wife Elizabeth by an 'unfair' and 'biased' divorce judge and that he had to put their £1.8million six-bedroom former home on the market and move into a rented one-bedroom flat. The estate agent, who made his fortune from a lettings agency in Hampstead, ironically complained to the Appeal Court that being forced to move into rented accommodation had left him 'nowhere near as comfortable as I have been accustomed to.' He argued that the award to his ex-wife effectively saw her handed double the share of the marital assets that he received. Top judges at the Appeal Court ruled that parts of the family court order made last December by Mrs Justice Judith Parker were 'plainly too favourable' to his ex-wife. The court heard how the husband and wife had lived all their married lives in north London, having been wed for more than 34 years, and had three grown up children when Mrs Malialis began divorce proceedings in 2007. As well as the estate agency, Selmans Lettings, and the £1.8million former matrimonial home in Finchley, north London, the couple had valuable business and property interests in Liberia and Cyprus. Mr Malialis, who Mrs Justice Parker said had a 31-year-old Ukrainian girlfriend, told the High Court last year that he was 'shocked' when his wife, aged 59, told him she was ending their marriage. She levelled accusations that her husband had been 'having relations with a call girl called Nicky' and 'wasted money by gambling in casinos', to the tune of £800,000. Mr Malialis countered by alleging that his wife had had an affair. Mrs Justice Parker declined to investigate those disputed allegations, but said that Mr Malialis had admitted spending £800,000 in casinos over the years. Despite being given £1million worth of assets by the divorce judge, Mr Malialis told the Appeal Court that sum was effectively reduced to £648,000 - less than half what his wife received - when his debts and liabilities were taken into account. He added that most of that sum is tied up in his businesses and, as a result, the former multi-millionaire is now living on just £11,000-a-year. Mr Malialis bemoaned his 'desperate financial position', saying a delay of 12 months between the divorce hearing and the judge’s decision meant that 'the judgment no longer reflected a fair division of the family fortune.' He said: 'The judge has awarded twice as much to my former wife which is grossly unfair. 'Most of what the judge has left me is tied up in business, therefore I will never be in a position to buy a home for myself and will be forced to rent accommodation which will be nowhere near as comfortable as what I have been accustomed to.' Elizabeth Malialis outside London's Appeal Court . 'I don’t want to be left without any money and have to stay in the one-bedroom rented flat I’m in at the moment indefinitely.' He added: 'My family made huge contribution to the matrimonial property. No reasonable judge who had read and understood the facts of the case could have reached the decisions she has reached. Her decision is perverse and completely biased against me.' Mr Malialis was accused in the family court by his former wife of concealing assets worth £22million. While Mrs Justice Parker found that there was no evidence that he had 'a £20million lifestyle', she did find that he had 'given a deliberately inaccurate or concocted account' to the court and 'not made full disclosure' in relation to his finances. But at the Appeal Court, Mr Malialis said that he had no reason to conceal that money from his former wife as he thought they were 'a happily married couple until she shocked me with news that she wanted a divorce.' Mr Malialis said that he had been a good husband and father for more than 30 years and was not a 'gangster.' He claimed that, because of the delay between hearing and judgement - due to the judge being taken seriously ill - she had 'forgotten the evidence and didn’t get to grips with the case.' David Sawtell, for Mrs Malialis - whose lifestyle Mrs Justice Parker found involved 'extravagant personal spending' - said that the judge had not made her decision on the division of wealth out of 'bias' but on the evidence and had not strayed outside her judicial discretion. Lord Justice Lewison concluded that the way the judge’s decision was framed had unfairly left Mr Malialis solely liable for £330,000 worth of debt on the couple’s property in Cyprus. The judge also criticised a clause giving the wife control over when Mr Malialis will receive his share of the marital assets, putting him in a position where he could potentially have to wait indefinitely. Allowing the appeal and altering Mrs Justice Parker's ruling, the judge said: 'The wife has been put in a better position than she would have been.' The ruling means in effect that the husband’s share of the marital assets has been increased by £165,000 and the period of time he must wait before receiving his portion has been taken out of his wife’s hands. Judges at London's Appeal Court, pictured, ruled that Justice Judith Parker's original divorce ruling was 'unsupportable and not fair' Lord Justice Thorpe, delivering the court’s main judgement, said: 'The history is unfortunate. The husband has described these proceedings as a disaster and I have some sympathy with that view. 'The trial took place in December 2010, but the judge did not deliver her judgement until December 2011. That is highly unusual in an ancillary relief trial. 'Mr Malialis has asserted that the 12 months between trial and judgement led to a number of errors and erroneous conclusions by the judge. 'I’m not persuaded that the fundamental division order made by the judge resulted from any misdirection or error or otherwise exceeded the generous ambit of her discretion. Mr Malialis said that the divorce settlement had meant that he had to put the couple's home on this leafy Finchley avenue on the market and rent a one-bedroom flat . 'However she wrongly, in my opinion, rejected submissions to limit the period in which the husband might be kept out of his allotted share of the assets.' The order that the husband bear the £330,000 debt had resuted in 'a windfall' for the wife and the judge said that clause was 'completely unsupportable and not fair.' Lord Justice Thorpe said: 'We are not happy that she came to the right decision on these points. We allow the appeal to the extent of redrafting aspects of the order which are plainly too favourable to the wife.' 'The husband has succeeded in reducing the shadow of this order on his future.'","Christos Malialis, 59, said that ruling had left him nowhere near 'as comfortable' as he is used to .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:52 EST, 15 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:19 EST, 16 July 2012 . Mitt Romney's campaign said on Sunday that President Barack Obama is willing to say anything to win a second term and should say he's sorry for attacks on the Republican's successful career at a private equity firm. But the president was adamant about his stance saying, 'No, we will not apologize,' adding that if Romney wants credit for his business leadership, he also needs to take responsibility. Questions about Romney's tenure at Bain Capital and the fortune he earned there have dogged the former Massachusetts governor as Obama and his allies have said the Boston-based firm shipped jobs overseas. Scroll down for video . Concern: Mitt Romney's campaign said on Sunday that President Barack Obama will say anything to win a second term and should say he's sorry for attacks on the Republican's successful career at Bain Capital . Romney insists he left the company in February 1999 to take over the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, but documents suggest he was still in charge as late as 2001. Romney's advisers, trying to explain the discrepancies between Romney's account and federal documents, offered fresh explanations to shift the campaign back to more comfortable ground. Should Obama apologize for attacks on Romney's private equity background? 'He actually retired retroactively at that point,' Romney adviser Ed Gillespie said. 'He ended up not going back to the firm after his time in Salt Lake City. So he was actually retired from Bain.' A second adviser, Kevin Madden, said Romney had no choice but to have his name listed on Security and Exchange Commission documents as he sought to transfer the company's leadership to partners. 'The reason that there is a document that had ... his signature is because, during that transition from 1999 to 2002 ... there was a duty to sign those documents,' Madden said. The exact role Romney played at the firm between 1999 and 2001 is important not only because critics have raised questions about his truthfulness, but also because Bain was sending jobs overseas during that period. 'Want to know': In Virginia on Saturday, Obama said, 'No, we will not apologize,' about remarks made from the president and his allies that Romney oversaw the Boston-based firm as it shipped jobs overseas . The president said Romney must square his explanation. 'Mr. Romney claims he's Mr. Fix-It for the economy because of his business experience, so I think voters entirely legitimately want to know what is exactly his business experience,' Obama told WAVY-TV in Portsmouth, Va., in an interview taped Saturday and posted on the station's website Sunday . 'Mr. Romney is now claiming he wasn't there at the time except his filings with the SEC listing says he was the CEO, chairman and president of the company.' Obama's advisers said that story won't sell voters. 'Either you're the CEO, president, chairman of the board of Bain Capital as you attest to the SEC or he's telling the American people he bears no responsibility for that,' deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter said. 'Both those things can't be true. Either you're in charge or you're not.' Romney has insisted he was not involved with Bain during the time it sent jobs overseas and had no day-to-day responsibility for the company. He said he wanted an apology from the president for implying otherwise. 'Do or say anything': Ed Gillespie, Romney's senior adviser who spoke on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday (pictured) has said Obama was being unfair because Romney had retired when jobs were sent overseas . 'No, we will not apologize,' Obama told the TV station. Cutter said Romney should take the advice - stop whining - that he gave his opponents during the Republican primary. 'Instead of whining about what the Obama campaign is saying, why don't you just put the facts out there and let people decide instead of trying to hide them?' Cutter said. Documents place Romney in charge of Bain from 1999 to 2001, a period in which the company outsourced jobs and ran companies that fell into bankruptcy. Romney has tried to distance himself from this period in Bain's history, saying on financial disclosure forms he had no active role in Bain as of February 1999. But at least three times since then, Bain listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' One of those documents - as late as February 2001 - lists Romney's 'principal occupation' as Bain's managing director. 'In charge or not': Obama's deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter (right) and Romney's senior campaign advisor Kevin Madden debate Romney's role int he overseas jobs issue on CBS's Face the Nation . 'He's very willing to take credit for everything good that he thinks happened after that point that Bain Capital was involved in, but he's not willing to take responsibility for this,' Obama strategist David Axelrod said, echoing comments Obama and his allies leveled in a weeklong blitz about Bain. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, said Obama's attacks cheapen the presidency and are an attempt to distract voters from Obama's record in office. 'With these attacks, it shows that he's just a small politician and running on small-ball politics at a time when our country is facing grave, grave challenges,' Ayotte said. Added Gillespie: 'We now know this president will say or do anything to keep the highest office in the land - even if it means demeaning the highest office in the land.' Romney's campaign released a television ad Sunday asking why the president had stopped talking about hope and change, his signature message during the 2008 campaign, and criticizing him for a barrage of negative ads against Romney. Obama's allies also pushed Romney to release more than the one year of tax returns he has shared. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former top White House aide, noted Romney released 23 years of taxes to 2008 GOP nominee John McCain so he could be considered as a vice presidential nominee. Romney and his family go on a boat ride in New Hampshire as a debate continues on Romney's exact role at Bain, where the presidential candidate earned much of his fortune. to determine his truthfulness . 'John McCain's people looked at it and went with Sarah Palin' as the No. 2 on the ticket that year. 'Whatever is in there is far worse than the first year,' Emanuel said. 'The Romney campaign isn't stupid. They have decided that it's better to get attacked on a lack of transparency, lack of accountability to the American people, versus telling you what's in those taxes.'

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 14:05 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:51 EST, 23 October 2012 . A convicted paedophile who advertised himself as a babysitter on the Gumtree website so he could film himself sexually abusing children faces being jailed indefinitely. Red Saunders, 23, was spared jail in 2005 after he admitted molesting a five-year-old girl while working as a playgroup organiser at a gym in Surrey. He was placed on a two-year supervision order and his name was placed on the Sex Offenders Register, but it was not enough to stop him re-offending six years later. 'Something has gone terribly wrong': Judge Charles Wide QC questioned why more steps were not taken to ensure Saunders would not re-offend in 2005. Saunders was 15 at the time . Following his arrest earlier this year detectives found a 'chilling' diary in which Saunders detailed his sickening plans to abuse children. He placed an advert under his brother's name offering his services on Gumtree and then fobbed off parents when they asked to see a Criminal Record Bureau check. Saunders then installed cameras in the rooms of two children aged seven and eight he was paid to look after and made videos of himself abusing them using the title 'Paedo Productions'. He also had a stash of more than 5,000 indecent images, films and cartoons. Today at the Old Bailey he pleaded guilty to a string of charges including rape, sexual assault and making indecent photos of a child. Judge Charles Wide QC expressed surprise at the original sentence passed by the Southeast Surrey Juvenile Court at Guildford Crown Court in 2005. ‘On the face of it something has gone terribly wrong. I cannot know what the Crown Court knew, and I’m not criticising them, but something has gone wrong in some way.’ In 2005 a full investigation, including a psychological report, was carried out on Saunders at Guildford Crown Court. Today the prosecutor said he was 'staggered' that 'nothing was done' at the time . Prosecutor Edward Lucas said: ‘I just cannot believe what occurred. 'In 2005, a full investigation, including a psychological report, was carried out independent of the sentencing exercise. 'I am staggered from what I have read that nothing was done in 2005. It was available to all to look at.He has been left free to do it again.' The judge told Saunders that the court was considering a sentence of indefinite imprisonment for public protection and adjourned sentence until November 23. He added: 'The defendant has pleaded guilty to a very large number of serious sexual offences relating to two young complainants. He has a previous conviction for sexual assault on a young child. 'The court will be considering imprisonment for public protection and the sentencing judge will be most concerned with the issue of dangerousness.' Saunders, of Merstham, Redhill, Surrey, has admitted one count of rape, three of sexual assault on a child, two of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, three counts of possessing prohibited images of a child and fourteen counts of making indecent photographs of a child. The court heard he was convicted of sexual assault of a five year old child in 2005 while working as a playgroup organiser at a local gym. Mr Lucas said: 'The young girl was playing hide and seek. This girl was left in the dark area of the gym and he asked her to show him her knickers.' He then took a photograph of her and sexually assaulted her. Saunders was given a two year supervision order. Mr Lucas said: ‘There was a full investigation done in 2005 and nothing resulted from it. 'Can I say I am staggered at what I have read and nothing was done about it in 2005 despite the material being available to all, the indecent images and comments made by the defendant about his interests. 'It was all catalogued and he has been free effectively to do it again.' The court heard the investigation uncovered a film in which Saunders made clear his plan to film indecent images of a girl aged between 10 and 12. Mr Lucas added: 'I don’t understand why the parents [of that alleged victim] were not told about the contents of that video.' Saunders was due to stand trial for sexually assaulting this child between 2002 and 2004 but the charges were left to lie on the film after his pleas to the other counts. Outside court the prosecutor explained that Saunders had advertised himself as a babysitter in Gumtree before abusing a seven year-old girl in October 2011 and an eight year-old girl in April 2012. He admitted two counts of sexual assault and one of making indecent images of a child in relation to the seven year-old and rape, sexual assault, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and one of making indecent photos relating to the eight year-old. Saunders admitted a further seven counts of making indecent photos relating to his filming of children playing in the street between February 2011 and April 2012. He admitted five counts of making indecent photos of a child relating to 2886 images at level one, 154 at level 2, 1350 at level 3, 1028 at level 4 and 25 at level 5. The most serious is level five which involves sadistic sex or bestiality involving children. Saunders also admitted three counts of possessing prohibited images of a child between November 2011 and April 2012 relating to 13 cartoon movie images at level 1, 174 cartoon movie images at level 3 and 35 cartoon movie images at level 4. Merstham in Surrey, where Saunders is from. Detective Constable Sam Renwick-Foster called him a 'predatory pedophile' and an 'obvious danger' to young children . Mr Lucas said: 'The court is going to have to see a lot of material, not least the particular acts against the children. 'They are professionally created films made by himself which show the abuse.' Seven counts of voyeurism, one count of attempted rape on the eight year old girl, and two counts of sexual assault relating to a third alleged victim between 2002 and 2004 were left to lie on the file. Detective Constable Sam Renwick-Foster said later: 'Red Saunders is a predatory pedophile who specifically targeted families with the intention of abusing their children. 'He poses an obvious danger to young children.' In April, Saunders had gone to work for a couple looking for a childminder, but after a few days he made his excuses and left. Following his departure the eight-year-old girl told her parents that Saunders had abused her.Saunders was arrested and a search of his home address revealed large quantities of images and footage depicting child abuse. As a result of this material further offences he committed against another girl were discovered.Detectives traced that child and discovered that at the time of the abuse he was also working as a childminder for that family. Saunders was remanded into custody.","Paedophile Red Saunders was spared jail in 2005 after admitting to molesting a five-year-old girl .

"By . Larisa Brown . PUBLISHED: . 03:44 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:19 EST, 25 October 2012 . One lucky lottery winner won enough money to buy several homes but has been able to stay in his taxpayer-funded council house . When most people hit the jackpot, they tend to splash their cash on frivolous shopping, plush sports cars and luxury homes. But one lucky lottery winner - who had the money to buy several pads wherever he so desired - is still living in a council house in Stroud. This means that despite his mega-win, his lifestyle is still being partly footed by the taxpayer. And he is entitled to stay in his local authority property, paying subsidised rent and no mortgage, as a lifetime tenant. The man in Gloucestershire - who has not been named - is said to have won a 'significant' sum but council rules prevent him being forced to move out . of social housing and buy his own place. The news comes at a time where there are more than 3,200 people who cannot afford their own homes on the council house waiting list in the Stroud area. Stroud District council tenant Margaret Marshall said she thought it was vastly unfair and that the lottery winner should move on. 'If I won then I'd go, because other people need homes,' said Mrs Marshall, who has lived at her address in Nailsworth for over 30 years. 'Otherwise, I might buy it, then they could build another with the money,' she said. The revelation of the winner's decision to stay in their home came at Stroud District Council's housing advisory panel. 'We had someone who won on the lottery a large, significant sum,' the council's housing advice manager Sue Leighton-Boyce told the meeting. 'They are still our tenant although they clearly had enough money to go out and buy several homes.' Councillors were discussing a review of their council homes allocation policy after a Government consultation suggested ending lifetime tenancies. Stroud, pictured, where there are more than 3,200 people on the council house waiting list . A further suggestion was that households with a gross income above £60,000 shouldn't qualify for social housing. The Government's Localism Act has given local authorities the ability to choose renewable tenancies instead. 'We have had another lady who married a very nicely-off gentleman,' said Ms Leighton-Boyce. 'They chose to live in their council house but he has another property, has a house abroad, a yacht abroad. In January Gareth and Catherine Bull scooped £41million but the couple said they had 'no plans' to move out of their home . 'Tenants were quite miffed about this and said why can't you do anything? Why are you still allowing them to live there?' she said. 'Under the current rules they have their tenancies for life,' she said. The council's rainbow political alliance are expected to decide about tenancy issues at their next executive on November 8. Tory Councillor Debbie Young, former cabinet member for housing, said renewable five-year tenancies would allow these situations to be reviewed. 'This lottery guy has highlighted the issue that people don't have to give up their properties even when they don't need them,' Mrs Young said. 'Surely this person's conscience should be pricked now?' In 2010 the Daily Mail revealed that 43,000 social households earn more . than £50,000 a year - at a time when more than 4million people in real . need were on waiting lists. Under reforms implemented in February last year, the scandal of people living in taxpayer-funded council homes, despite earning tens of thousands of pounds a year, was brought to a close. Ministers confirmed that council housing for life would no longer be possible for new tenants, with people being asked to sign shorter tenancies to enable them to be thrown out if their salary rises too high. And the government introduced new 'affordable rents', set at different rates according to how much the tenant can pay. But the lifetime rules do not apply to those well-off tenants living on existing tenancies - which means thousands of wealthier people can still enjoy their council properties. In January, Gareth and Catherine Bull from Nottinghamshire scooped £41million but the couple said they had 'no plans' to quit work or move out of their home, which is not a council house. Mr Bull, a self-employed builder, and Mrs Bull, who works in health insurance, said their home was already their 'dream home' and they did not want to move. They announced they would splash out on one particular luxury - a new carpet for their upstairs landing. When Matt Topham and his fiancée Cassey Carrington won £45million on the lottery in February, they said they would buy themselves the home of their dreams. Surprisingly, the couple bought a small £249,000 house on a cul-de-sac in Nottinghamshire. The 22-year-olds were said to be 'delighted' with their new home, despite living between a housing estate on side side and a busy main road on the other.","Gloucestershire man - who has not been named - can stay in taxpayer-funded council house for life due to local authority property rules .

Dupuytren's contracture: BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew has had eight operations to his hand . Despite eight operations, the BBC’s ‘Voice of Cricket’, Jonathan Agnew, remains plagued by a crippling condition of the fingers that, untreated, could have led to amputation. ‘Aggers’, 52, is a sufferer of Dupuytren’s contracture, in which the fingers gradually curl over into a claw-like state. Here he talks about this progressive condition. If TV viewers look carefully at  my right hand holding the microphone, they will see that my little finger is bent over at an extraordinary angle, and my index  finger is curling inward. This is the visible sign of my Dupuytren’s contracture, which is named after Baron Guillaume Dupuytren, the surgeon who first described an operation to correct the affliction in 1831. If I hadn’t had eight operations to date, my hands could now be virtually useless. Recently, I was in my local pub in Leicestershire and, as I left, I reached out to shake the hand of the publican, Don, when I realised one of his hands was entirely curled in on itself. This is what happens if you do not treat Dupuytren’s – the hand gradually contracts until it is little better than a claw. In some sufferers, amputation is the only relief. While Dupuytren’s is not a painful  condition, it seriously affects the quality of your life. I can no longer play the piano, which I love, and I am very conscious of it as I have to shake so many hands as a BBC cricket commentator. Undoubtedly, playing cricket (I played county cricket for Leicestershire from 1979 to 1990 and have three England caps) has played a major part in my getting Dupuytren’s, owing to the repeated thumps of the ball into my hands. Quite a few cricketers have it, including  Graham Gooch and David Gower. Most sufferers have a genetic predisposition, and I have traced it to my mother’s side of the family: I have a first cousin who also suffers from Dupuytren’s. I first noticed the symptoms when I was 40 – a bobble formed in the middle of the palm of my right hand. My sister-in-law, who is a GP, diagnosed it. As the bobble hardened and began to spread into a cord-like band heading up into my little finger, the finger began to curl irretrievably towards my palm. It was very uncomfortable and performing small, everyday tasks became problematic. Cause: The former professional cricketer, pictured commentating a game with former England captain Michael Vaughan, say the years playing the game has has played a major part in getting Dupuytren's . With Dupuytren’s, the connective tissue under the skin of the hand starts to harden and contract, creating a rope-like band that pulls the fingers inwards. No one really knows what causes it. It isn’t life-threatening, but it certainly affects the quality of your life – all of us need our hands for everything we do. I began to worry about the effect on my career. As a journalist, how would I type? And even simple things such as turning the handle on a door have become problematic and frustrating. I had my first operation when I was 40, with a marvellous surgeon Hugh Henderson at a private clinic in Leicestershire. I’ve since had surgery at the Hand Clinic in Derby under Peter Lunn. The tightening connective tissue was cut, releasing the finger, and the relief is immediate. But I had to have my hands bandaged for some time afterwards. Agnew's struggle: His condition has been his biggest test as a journalist and commentator . I thought this might sort the problem . out, but then I noticed the fingers on  my left hand were affected, too. In the more recent operations, they have cut away more deeply at the . scar tissue. But the biggest problem remains  with my little finger on my right hand which, despite the numerous operations, is bent at a 45-degree angle. It makes me feel extremely self-conscious, and the drastic solution would be to have it amputated, but I really don’t want to do that. This would make it very hard for me  to grip anything – as it is, I cannot perform simple tasks, such as rubbing suncream on to my wife’s back or drying myself after a shower. I have also tried wearing splints on my hands to try to straighten the fingers, but as you can imagine, this is also disabling and makes getting about awkward. So far, I have managed not to let the condition affect my work, but it is a concern and I know I am going to have to have further treatment. As I am reluctant to have more surgery, I’m looking at the new, non-invasive treatments becoming available. At the moment, when I shake hands with people I can see them, if not actually recoil, look down at my hands. This contracting tissue is also now wrapping itself around my index finger, and I need to have that sorted out. It isn’t the kind of condition you can just leave, as it will become worse and worse. It feels as if I have a tight elastic  band under my skin, which is always constricting. I’m thankful that I still have my grip  in both hands, but if I don’t have further treatment I could potentially lose  that. Physiotherapy doesn’t help, as the problem lies under the skin, and it becomes physically impossible to straighten your fingers. About two million people in the UK suffer from this condition, so I am keen to encourage more to have Dupuytren’s treated as soon as symptoms first emerge, because the longer you leave it, the more scar tissue forms and the more likely you are to lose mobility in the hand. Amputation is the most extreme treatment, but it can be necessary if all else fails. Jonathan Agnew was talking to Diana Appleyard.","Jonathan Agnew suffers from Dupuytren’s contracture .

Vince Cable today performed some fancy footwork to side step complaints from senior Liberal Democrats that he is getting too close to Labour. The ballroom dancing Business Secretary is under growing pressure to explain why he has been in talks with Labour leader Ed Miliband while serving in a Cabinet led by Tory David Cameron. Mr Cable's aides have dismissed the idea that he is preparing to cross the political dancefloor, saying: ‘Vince is not looking for a new partner.' Scroll down for video . Fancy footwork: Lib Dem minister Vince Cable who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, has denied looking to partner with Labour leader Ed Miliband in a future coalition . In a stinging rebuke, former Lib Dem . leader Sir Menzies Campbell yesterday warned Mr Cable he could only step out with one coalition . partner with one party at once. But today Mr Cable insisted he was behaving in a ‘reasonably adult way’ and had ‘nothing to be embarrassed about’. With critics including many senior Tories giving him low scores for his performance as Business Secretary, Mr Cable took a break from trying to get the economy moving to reveal his tip for this year’s Strictly Come Dancing. Mr Cable told ITV1's Daybreak: 'Of the field I’ve seen I think Victoria Pendleton… very competitive… very athletic.' Vince Cable tipped 'very athletic' Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton to win the new series of Strictly . The Olympic gold medal-winning cyclist has insisted she is not feeling the pressure of taking part in the BBC dance show. But Mr Cable was put on the spot to explain why he has been trying to tango with Mr Miliband. Mr Cable was an advisor to Labour's John Smith before joining the Liberal Democrats. While unveiling his overhaul of employment law today, Vince Cable had only one thing on his mind: . His Friday dance lesson. 'I like ballroom and Latin,' he told ITV1's Daybreak. 'I like Rumba.' After tipping 'very competitive… very athletic' Victoria Pendleton for success in the new series of Strictly, he confessed: 'I have got my own dancing lesson this afternoon.' Rules on impartiality meant he could not take part in the full Strictly series. But in December 2010 he was allowed to compete in the Christmas special, partnered with ballroom professional Erin Boag, pictured above . The pair performed the American Smooth and the foxtrot. Playing down his Labour links today, he said he made contact ‘very, very occasionally’. 'I’ve said this many times before, I think in politics you have to have a reasonably adult way of dealing with people. 'I very, very occasionally talk to Ed Miliband and sometimes his people and, indeed, people across the spectrum. ‘It doesn’t matter, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about, for him or for me, I talk to people across the political spectrum, I think that’s what politics involves, being grown up, not being tribal. 'I don’t feel remotely embarrassed about that.’ But Sir Menzies disagrees, telling . the House magazine - which is circulated to MPs- yesterday: ‘The success . of this Coalition depends upon everyone who participates in it being a . full subscriber. 'I don’t think it helps a partnership to suggest that you may already be looking for another partner.’ Mr Cable revealed he was off to a dance lesson this afternoon, but not before unveiling plans to make it easier for company bosses to get rid of under-performing staff. The shake-up of employment laws will . cut how much compensation workers can win in unfair dismissal cases but . Tory-backed ‘fire at will’ reforms have been abandoned. Mr . Cable told Daybreak: ‘We are trying to have it both ways because we do . want the best of both worlds, we want to have confidence in business . that they can hire people. 'But we want people to go to work knowing that . at the end of the day, if they have a very bad relationship, they do . have some basic labour rights and protection.’ The limit on unfair dismissal payouts will be reduced to a maximum of 12 months' salary or set at an even lower figure. Pick a partner: Vince Cable has defended contacting Ed Miliband (left) while working with David Cameron (right) in coalition . Vince Cable and Labour's Ed Balls were accused of a 'love-in' after they appeared together on BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show . And . the current £72,300 cap on pay-offs will also be cut significantly in . the hope of encouraging small businesses to start hiring more staff. Chuka Ummuna, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said: ‘Ministers should be making it easier to hire, not easier to fire people. 'We are in a double dip recession due . to this Government's failed economic policies, not because of the . protections people have at work. Instead of adopting a credible plan for . growth, this Government is attacking rights of every employee in this . country. ‘Sacrificing people's rights at work is not the way to bolster consumer confidence and get our economy moving again.’ Sir Menzies Campbell (right) has warned Vince Cable against 'looking for another partner' while in coalition with the Tories . Also among the reforms are plans to giving judges powers to sift through tribunal cases before they reach court to allow them to dismiss weak cases without the need for a hearing. TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said: 'Reducing payouts for unfair dismissals will let bad employers off lightly and deter victims from pursuing genuine cases. 'For all the Government's talk that helping businesses to sack poor performing workers will make them more productive this is little more than a smokescreen to erode hard-won rights.'

A pupil at a top private boarding school appeared in court today accused of stabbing another sixth former. The 17-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and wounding with intent after the incident on Sunday night at Langley School near Norwich. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared before magistrates in Great Yarmouth today. He was remanded in custody. Court: A 17 year old pupil at the prestigious Langley School has been charged stabbing another sixth-former . Norfolk Police said the injured boy, who is also aged 17, had suffered serious stab wounds to his elbow and shoulder at the school which has been praised for its ‘caring ethos’. He was today said to be in a stable condition in the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. Langley School, a co-educational day and boarding school, currently has boarding fees of £8,100 a term and day fees of £3,985. It has 729 pupils - 429 boys and 300 girls - with 648 day pupils and 81 boarders. Langley School headmaster Dominic Findlay said he could not comment on the incident due to the police investigation. He said: 'Both boys involved are part of an investigation and at this stage I can’t comment.' Victim: The stabbed boy is in the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, pictured, with wounds in his shoulder and elbow . A parent of pupils at the school, who did not want to be named, claims that pupils had been told they would be expelled if they talked about the stabbing. But Mr Findlay dismissed the suggestion that pupils would be expelled or excluded for talking about the incident as 'ridiculous' and 'complete rubbish'. He added: 'All students have been informed of the incident by me in an assembly and all students have been spoken to. They’ve been offered support if required and that’s as much as what’s been said to the students. 'We’ve offered support to friends of the two students if they wanted to talk to staff about it and we’ve done that.' A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service Trust said paramedics were called to the school just before 10.30pm on Sunday and an ambulance was on scene at just after 10.45pm. He confirmed two teenagers were taken to hospital, one with a serious injury to his back, the other less serious to his arm. Neither was thought to be in a life-threatening condition. Langley School was founded in Norwich in 1910 and moved to a Grade One listed 18th century mansion in Loddon in 1946. The headmaster states on the school website: “Langley is a warm and friendly school with clear values and high aspirations for all its students. 'The school provides a first class, all round education in a supportive community, in which our students learn to become independent, valued citizens and are able to develop their potential to the full.'

A woman who has been married eight times has appeared on This Morning to discuss her colourful love life - and to make an impassioned plea to find husband number nine. Sandra McNab has had eight weddings over a 39 year period - all of which have ended in divorce. Now says she just wants to find Mr Right. 'He's out there looking for me now,' she jokes. Asked if she is a hopeless romantic, Sandra, from Clydebank, near Glasgow says revealingly that she just sees the good in everyone. 'I see the good in everyone': Sandra McNab attempts to explain why she has had so many husbands as she appears on the This Morning sofa with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford . 'Of course in the past I've asked myself, is it me or is it them?' she confesses. 'When it was younger, it might have been me. I was boisterous, rebellious. 'But the truth is, I wear my heart on my sleeve. I had no idea there were bad people out there - and I learned the hard way.' Sandra is frequently dubbed Scotland's answer to Liz Taylor by locals and in the Press - something she says she used to find very difficult. 'At first that was upsetting,' she says. 'Until my brother turned around and said, ""she was voted the most beautiful woman in the world"" Then I thought, come on, it's not so bad,' Sandra says. Suggesting that Sandra must be a 'magnet' to men, Eamonn Holmes, interviewing Sandra alongside his wife Ruth Langsford, asks whether she would be satisfied simply dating these men, instead of marrying each one she meets. Happy childhood: Sandra says the strong marriages of her parents and grandparents fuel her own desire for a happy ending . 'You sound like my mother,' she says. 'She used to say, ""Sandra, you can date them, you can bed them - it doesn't mean you've got to wed them!"" Sandra says her parents' and grandparents' happy marriages fuelled her passion for romance - and that the paradigm they set laid the foundations for her need to marry. 'I was married for the first time at 16,' she says. 'You look at your parents, and they're happy. 'To me, marriage meant happiness. Granny and Grandpa: happy. 'But then looking back, I realise at 16 that was a bit ridiculous. 'Then as time went on, it was morals and scruples. We've all got our own.' Sandra says characteristics her ideal man would possess are honesty and trust. 'And he shouldn't look at my outside,' she says. 'There is a heart and soul inside. 'I wouldn’t look at me twice without make up. You have to look at people’s heart, not their outside. Incredibly, Sandra says her string of failed marriages has not put her off men for life. 'Two out of three ain't bad!' Eamonn Holmes jokes that Sandra's good looks and good sense of humour stand in her favour - but she laughs that the fact she is broke doesn't help her appeal .

A Newsnight investigation into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile, pictured, was 'inappropriately' pulled . Culture Secretary Maria Miller was under fire yesterday as she ruled out a full independent inquiry into the Jimmy Savile scandal. Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman said the issue had 'cast a stain' on the BBC, and MPs on all sides voiced dismay at the corporation's handling of the affair. Miss Harman said Savile's 'exalted' status within the corporation had allowed him to act with impunity. Tory MP Rob Wilson complained the BBC had still not adequately explained why it dropped a Newsnight report into Savile's crimes last December. In an emergency statement to the Commons, Mrs Miller replied: 'The BBC has launched three separate investigations. The first will look particularly at the allegations with regard to the item on Savile which was inappropriately pulled from Newsnight.' Her aides later insisted she had 'misspoken' and had meant to say 'allegations' that the report was pulled inappropriately. But Mrs Miller's intervention will add to the sense of crisis at the BBC over its handling of the scandal. BBC director general George Entwistle will be grilled by MPs next week over the decision to not air the Newsnight investigation into Saville and also about how much was known at senior levels about the allegations. He will also face questions on whether wider concerns about a culture of sexual harassment at the BBC have been tackled. In an email to staff last night, BBC director of news Helen Boaden said the corporation was confident the investigation had been dropped for 'sound editorial reasons', but acknowledged that 'people have continued to speculate'. She added: 'This is a tough time for the organisation as a whole and for some individuals in particular. A lot of soul-searching is naturally taking place.' Maria Miller, left, said the corporation was treating allegations 'very . seriously' while Harriet Harman, right, said the claims had 'cast a . stain on the BBC' Labour leader Ed Miliband called on . Mrs Miller to launch an independent inquiry into the corporation's . conduct. He said: 'I don't think the BBC can lead their own inquiry... I think we need a broader look at these public institutions – the BBC, . I'm afraid some parts of the NHS, potentially, Broadmoor. BBC Director General George Entwistle has offered to appear before a select committee . 'I'm . open-minded about how it's done but it's got to be independent.' Mr Miliband also signalled he would support 'brave' victims in their fight to get compensation. Tory MP Anne Main said Mrs Miller . should ask Lord Justice Leveson to extend his inquiry into press . standards to investigate the BBC's handling of the Savile scandal. She . said she was not confident the BBC had the 'wherewithal to clean out its . own Augean stables'. But Mrs Miller said she was confident the BBC was taking the allegations 'very seriously'. Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine said . Savile will become known as 'one of the most serious predatory . paedophiles in criminal history'. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature . Festival, Mr Vine said: 'The fact that a person was using his BBC . prestige and maybe even BBC dressing rooms to attack young children, I . find disgusting.' Police are pursuing 340 leads and . believe twisted Savile claimed more than 60 victims in a reign of child . abuse that lasted until he was at least 79. * Andrew Marr's drunken clinch with a . young female producer was raised in Parliament as MPs debated whether . the 'culture' of the BBC had really changed. The 53-year-old broadcaster was . photographed kissing and fondling the woman last month. Democratic . Unionist MP Ian Paisley Jr challenged Mrs Miller in the Commons by . saying: 'Are you utterly convinced the culture of the BBC has changed . since the revelations of the vile actions of Jimmy Savile? 'Just a matter of weeks ago we had one . of their senior talent caught in photographs in the grips of a young . woman with his hand down her trousers in a public place. He gets away . with it with nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders and a silly . excuse. 'You know this inquiry by the police . will take years and that the BBC will get away in the smoke. Surely now . is the time for an independent inquiry into the BBC?' Mrs Miller said a wider investigation . into allegations of sexual harassment at the BBC was already under way, . but that Mr Paisley was right to call for it to consider recent . allegations. Labour called tonight for the Government to set up an independent inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal to 'do right by the victims'. Culture Secretary Maria Miller earlier dismissed demands for an independent inquiry, saying she was 'confident' BBC chiefs were taking the claims 'very seriously'. But Labour leader Ed Miliband said the BBC's internal investigations were not enough.Speaking to ITV1's The Agenda, he said: 'These are horrific allegations. In order to do right by the victims I don't think the BBC can lead their own inquiry. 'We need a broad look at all the public institutions involved - the BBC, parts of the NHS and Broadmoor. This has got to be independent.' Labour wants an independent inquiry to have the power to demand documentation and witnesses. It should look into Savile's activities at the BBC, Stoke Mandeville hospital and Broadmoor, the party said. 'I think we now have enough set of allegations and further allegations to know this is not some isolated set of incidents,' Mr Miliband said. 'This seems to be a pattern of activity which spanned a number of institutions. As I say, I just think about the victims in this. This is absolutely horrific and will scar people for life. And I think for them, the BBC - good institution though it is - I don't think they can lead their own inquiry.' Responding to Ed Miliband's call for an independent inquiry, a government spokesman said last night: 'Nothing has been ruled out, however, it would be incredibly premature to pre-judge the outcome of the BBC inquiries and the police investigation.'

The new iPad has proved to be another hot-seller, with thousands of fans queuing up all night at shops across the world to get their hands on the tablet. The sales are doing wonders for Apple's share price, which hit $600 for the first time just as the new iPad launched. So, if you have the cash to spend, you have a choice - one new iPad, or one share in Apple. Joy of the purchase: Zohaib Ali was first in the long line of eager iPad buyers - all helping to buoy Apple's share price . It is another milestone figure for Apple - which has $97.6billion of cash in the coffers. Two weeks ago the tech giant became more valuable than the entire nation of . Poland, with the company's stock value soaring past $500billion. The buzz of the latest launch helped propel Apple's share price to a high of $600.01 before easing back slightly to $585.56. The peak came half an hour after the first iPad went on sale in Australia, extending the market worth of the world's most valuable company to almost $560 billion. What you've been waiting for? After months of speculation, and a week of anticipation, the iPad hits the shelves . Only a month earlier, the stock price had crossed $500 for the first time, and the £100 jump means Apple's stock has risen 45 per cent this year. With Thursday's closing price of $585.56, Apple's share price is far more expensive than the $499 starting price for a WiFi iPad in the U.S. The new iPad goes on sale today in 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, France and Britain, with diehards lining up overnight in front of Apple stores in Munich, Paris, London, Singapore and Hong Kong. Wall Street expects a strong start for the latest iPad and some analysts even expect sales of the current model to overtake the iPad 2. Apple will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100 to start at $399. Apple may sell 65.6 million iPads, according to an estimate by Canaccord Genuity analysts, who also raised their target price on Apple stock to $710 from $665. So far, the company has sold 55 million iPads since it was launched in 2010. Apple become only the sixth company in history to soar past half a trillion dollars on March 7. Apple's value was $506bn - in contrast to Poland, with a population of 38 million people, which has a GDP figure of just $497bn. The company, co-founded by Steve Jobs, is also worth more than Belgium, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. Apple's value only overtook Microsoft in May 2010 - but since then their ascent has been rapid. Microsoft saw their value hit $600bn in 2000 - but after losing their dominance they are now worth just $267bn. Steve Jobs: The Apple leader remembered the lean times of the 1990s . Cisco Systems, Intel and General Electricity also peaked just above $500bn in early 2000. Cisco and Intel are now worth a bit more than $100bn each, while GE is worth $200bn. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company has more money than it needs, and the board and management are thinking 'very deeply' about ways to use the cash. Former CEO Steve Jobs, apparently haunted by the company's lean years in the 1990s, had a policy of accumulating cash and the company now sits on a war chest worth $97.6billion. China's largest oil company, PetroChina, was briefly worth $1trillion after it listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2007, but only based on its price on that exchange. Its shares also trade in Hong Kong and on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on trading there, its market capitalization has never reached $500bn. Apple's iPhone business is now bigger than the whole of Microsoft, according to recent revenue figures. The company's smartphone division generated $24.4 billion of revenue in the quarter up until December, whereas the whole of Microsoft generated $20.9 billion in the same quarter. That includes entertainment devices such as Xbox, as well as Windows, Microsoft Office and Windows Phone.","Apple's value is more than nation of Poland, as stock soars past $500bn .

Hammill was detained after allegations one of the ambulance crew was manhandled after being called out to treat another man in the street at 3.30am. The 24-year-old former Liverpool Academy star was kept in custody for over 15 hours and was questioned on suspicion of common assault before being freed on police bail. If charged and convicted he could face up to six months in prison. The incident occurred after pub closing time in the early hours of Sunday when Hammill, on loan at Huddersfield from Championship rivals Wolves, was out at the Revolution Bar in Liverpool city centre. Paramedics had been called out after another man had required treatment after falling ill outside the bar which had closed 90 minutes earlier. But as the female paramedic tried to help him it was claimed she was 'assaulted'. Dave Kitchin, from the North West Ambulance Service, said: 'The Trust can confirm that an ambulance crew attended an incident on Temple Court in Liverpool city centre in the early hours of Sunday morning and one of our staff was the victim of an assault.

Barack Obama faces renewed pressure at the final presidential debate on his handling of the Benghazi attack where four Americans were killed including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Intelligence sources have now revealed that it appears the attack happened by chance and was not pre-planned. It is believed that the deadly assault came about following the protests at the American Embassy in Cairo. Questions: Obama faces renewed pressure over his administration's handling of the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi . 'Right now, there isn’t any intelligence that the attackers pre-planned their assault days or weeks in advance,' a U.S. intelligence official told ABC. The source added that attackers may have seized the opportunity to attack the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi following the violence in Cairo. It is the latest development on the deadly attack on September 11 after it was revealed that American drones were in the skies above the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Defense department officials considered sending troops in to rescue the ambassador and staff, according to CBS News, but ultimately decided not to. They would haven been able to watch the attack on-screen as it unfolded. It also emerged last week that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens repeatedly pleaded with the State Department to ramp up his security team in Libya - requests that the Pentagon ultimately denied. Stevens warned the State Department of a 'security vacuum' in Libya 'that is being exploited by independent actors' in one cable that described rapidly deteriorating security conditions. 'Islamic extremists are able to attack the Red Cross with impunity,' he wrote. 'What we have seen are not random crimes of opportunity but rather targeted discriminate attacks.' Deadly: Four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, died in the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi . Stevens said the attackers would not be deterred 'until authorities are at least as capable.' Just hours before his death, he sent . the Pentagon a cable describing 'expanding Islamist influence in Dema,' a . town east of Benghazi, and said he was seeing a 'troubling increase in . violence and Islamist influence.' Stevens recapped a meeting in which . the commander of Benghazi's Supreme Security Council told him there is . 'growing frustration with police and security forces.' The cables were released by . Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the chairman of the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is investigating . the security matters surrounding Stevens' death and questioning whether . the State Department could have prevented the deadly attack. Less than three weeks ahead of the . presidential election, Republicans are using the cables to attack . President Obama on his foreign policy, despite the State Department's . claim that it was solely responsible for the decisions to deny Stevens' requests for more security in Libya. 'These critical foreign policy decisions are not made by low or . mid-level career officials -- they are typically made through a . structured and well-reasoned process that includes the National Security . Council and the White House,' Issa wrote in a letter to Obama on Friday. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . The letter claims that Obama had a . political motivation in rejecting Stevens' security requests, since the . president was eager to show improving conditions in Libya after the . U.S.-led international operation that toppled Libya dictator Moamar . Gadhafi. On August 2, six weeks before Stevens . was killed, he requested 'protective detail bodyguard' positions, . calling the security situation in Libya 'unpredictable, volatile and . violent.' A month earlier, he requested that . the State Department extend his tour of duty personnel, which is a . 16-man temporary security team trained in combating terrorism. The . request was denied and the security team left 8 August. Stevens had asked for the security team to stay through mid-September. Colonel Andrew Wood, the leader of . the security team that left Libya in the weeks before the terror attack, . told CBS News that Stevens fought hard against losing the team. 'It was quite a degree of frustration . on their part,' he said. 'They were -- I guess you could say -- . clenched-fist over the whole issue. Questions: In their debate on Tuesday, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney argued over when Obama first said it was a terror attack . The White House maintained publicly for a week that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya was a . spontaneous mob upset about an anti-Islam video, even though it has now . been revealed that they were informed within 24 hours of the attack . that it was planned and carried out by militants. 'Your administration has not been . straightforward with the American people in the aftermath of the . attack,' Issa wrote in his letter to Obama. In . his Rose Garden address the morning after the killings, Obama said, 'No . acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter . that character or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.' But . Republicans say he was speaking generally and didn't specifically call . the Benghazi attack a terror attack until weeks later, with the . president and other key members of his administration referring at first . to the anti-Muslim movie circulating on the Internet as a precipitating . event. Last week, the State Department said . that it never believed the 11 September attack on the U.S. consulate was . the result of a protest over an anti-Islam movie, contradicting . previous statements. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . The White House now says the attack . probably was carried out by an al Qaida-linked group, with no public . demonstration beforehand. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton . blamed the 'fog of war' for the early conflicting accounts. Issa's committee questioned State . Department officials for hours about what Republican lawmakers said was . lax security at the consulate, given the growth of extremist Islamic . militants in North Africa. Congressional aides are hoping to use . Stevens' cables and information from State Department testimonies to . build a timeline of what . the intelligence community knew, compared to what the White . House was telling the public about the attack. That could give Romney . ammunition to use in his foreign policy debate with Obama on Monday . night. Reports have revealed that the CIA station . chief in Libya compiled an intelligence briefing from eyewitnesses within 24 . hours of the assault on the consulate that indicated militants launched . the violence. The briefing from the station chief was . written late Wednesday, 12 September and reached intelligence agencies in . Washington the next day, intelligence officials said. Yet . on Saturday of that week, briefing points sent by the CIA to Congress . said 'demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the . protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct . assault.' Haven: Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith were hiding in a safe room which later filled with diesel smoke . The briefing . points, obtained by the AP, added: 'There are indications that . extremists participated in the violent demonstrations' but did not . mention eyewitness accounts that blamed militants alone. Such . raw intelligence reports by the CIA on the ground would normally be . sent first to analysts at the headquarters in Langley, Virginia, for . vetting and comparing against other intelligence derived from . eavesdropping drones and satellite images. Only then would such intelligence . generally be shared with the White House and later, Congress, a process . that can take hours, or days if the intelligence is coming only from one . or two sources who may or may not be trusted. U.S. intelligence officials say in this case the delay was due in part to . the time it took to analyze various conflicting accounts. One official, speaking on condition . of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the incident . publicly, explained that 'it was clear a group of people gathered that . evening' in Benghazi, but that the early question was 'whether extremists . took over a crowd or they were the crowd.' But that explanation has been met with concern in Congress. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate . 'The early sense from the intelligence community differs from what we are hearing now,' Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said. 'It ended up being pretty far afield, so we want to figure out why ... though we don't want to deter the intelligence community from sharing their best first impressions' after such events in the future. 'The intelligence briefings we got a week to 10 days after were consistent with what the administration was saying,'said Rep. William Thornberry, a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees. Thornberry would not confirm the existence of the early CIA report but voiced skepticism over how sure intelligence officials, including CIA Director David Petraeus, seemed of their original account when they briefed lawmakers on Capitol Hill. 'How could they be so certain immediately after such events, I just don't know,'he said. 'That raises suspicions that there was political motivation.'","U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens repeatedly pleaded with the State Department for additional security personnel .

Google's Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt says the firms battle with Apple will define the future of technology. The battle between the firms has intensified in recent weeks as Apple dropped Google's maps app from its iPhone, replacing it with a troubled in house version. The decision was believed to have been made by amid amid rising tensions over Google's Android phone software. Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt says the firm's battle with Apple will be the 'defining battle' of the technology age. Schmidt said today he expects more than a billion mobile devices around the world to be running its Android software within a year, intensifying a battle with Apple Inc that he called a 'defining fight' of the industry.Schmidt said there were already four times as many Android mobile gadgets - smartphones and tablets made by the likes of Samsung Electronics - and that the scale of the battle between the two firms was unprecedented. 'We've not seen ... competitive fights on this scale,' he said during an interview with tech blog AllThingsDigital at New York's 92nd Street Y on Wednesday. Google and Apple were once close partners, with Schmidt serving on Apple's board during part of his tenure as Google CEO. But the ties between the two have been strained by the rise of Google's Android mobile operating system, now the world's leading platform for smartphones and a direct threat to Apple's lucrative iPhone and iPad businesses. As competition between the two companies has heated up, Apple has moved to cut its reliance on Google products by dumping YouTube from the new iPhone's pre-loaded selection of apps and replacing Google's mapping software on the iPhone with its own mapping service. Apple's foray into mapping has not gone smoothly. Apple CEO Tim Cook was forced to issue a public apology earlier this month amid complaints that the product - based on Dutch navigation equipment maker and digital map maker TomTom NV's data - contained glaring geographic errors and gaps in information. 'What Apple has learned is that maps are really hard,' Schmidt said. Youtube South Korean singer Psy, whose song 'Gangnam Style' teaches Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt his signature 'horse dance' 'We invested hundreds of millions of dollars in satellite work, airplane work, drive by work, to get the maps accurate.' But he added that the two technology companies were 'always in communication with each other.' Schmidt also said he did not expect Google to become a significant player in China any time soon, following its 2010 standoff with the government over Web censorship and cyber-attacks that Google said originated in China. Google relocated its search engine to Hong Kong in the wake of the episode, allowing Chinese search engine Baidu Inc to widen its lead in China, one of the few markets in the world where Google's search engine is not dominant.'Baidu will continue to be the Number One player in China for a long time,' Schmidt said. He said that he did not expect any mending of ties with the Chinese government, which he said has cut off access to Google's Web services in the past. China has in its power to arbitrarily restrict our access to Chinese citizens to keep us at whatever percentage market share they wish,' Schmidt said.","Schmidt predicted a billion gadgets will run Google's Android software within a year .

Flying ants ready themselves for take-off: The first major UK survey of the creatures' aerial habits has revealed there is no one 'flying ant day' The UK's first major study of 'flying ant day' has revealed not one but two flying ant days, and indeed large numbers of ants were reported over two flying ant weeks. When the UK’s garden ants took to the air this summer, the Society of Biology received over 6,000 reports from members of the public as part of its first flying ant survey. Professor Adam Hart, an ecologist and insect expert at the University of Gloucestershire, presented the results of the survey at a Biology Week awards ceremony last night. He said: 'Each year males and virgin queens take part in remarkable mating flights. So-called ""flying ant day"" is one of the rituals of our summer, and this year we turned anecdotal evidence into a scientific study. 'We found a relationship between flying ant swarms and weather conditions, which we expected, and geographical variation, which we didn’t expect.' About one-in-five sightings happened on Tuesday 24th July, and another one in five came two weeks later on Wednesday 8th August. These peaks were extremely striking, but still these two flying ant days accounted for fewer than half of the records. In fact, flying ants were a common sight for the days in July and August around the two peaks. The time between the two peaks was a period of low pressure, which is usually associated with clouds, wind and rain. This suggests that the weather had a large role to play in determining when the ants flew. Swarming: The most common flying ants seen around Britain are black garden ants - Lasius niger . What scientists don’t yet know is . whether these two peaks happened because the first peak was interrupted . by bad weather, or whether this is a common pattern. The survey will continue over the next few years to explore this question further. Interestingly, there was no evidence . of a trend across the UK, with no difference in timing between the north . and south. The geographical pattern was in fact very complex, and it is . likely that local conditions played an important role. 'Even . over a small area, emergences happened on different days, suggesting . that local synchronisation is not as precise as is widely believed,' said Professor Hart. Flying ant day outbreaks occur when male ants and females - potential queens - head to the skies to find a partner. By far the most common flying ants are the black garden ant, Lasius niger. The ants we see throughout the year are workers (sterile females), but flying ants are males and new queens undergoing their nuptial flight. Sadly for the males, they die soon after, while the females go on to build new colonies. Queens can live for around 10-15 years and only mate once. Having mated, a new queen will drop her wings then start her own colony. Once she has dug a nest she will lay her first eggs, and use her wing muscles for energy until the first workers are ready to forage. Over the next few years she will keep laying eggs and her colony will typically reach 5,000 workers, but some grow to have 15,000. Despite its miniscule size, the black garden ant has a huge impact on our countryside, from improving soil to pollination and pest control. They are also an important source of food for many other creatures; many people are alerted to the presence of flying ants by the sound of feasting gulls. 'This . is a clear example of the value of turning anecdotal evidence into a . scientific study. 'It will be fascinating to see whether this holds true . every year.' One factor which was very consistent was the time at which the ants emerged: normally between 4pm and 6pm. This suggests that, although weather affects whether ants swarm that day, it doesn’t affect the time of day they fly. 'Mid-afternoon . flights make sense: this gives them just enough time to find somewhere . to hide, but not too much time for exposure to predators,' said . Professor Hart. 'They can’t risk flying at night because they can’t see and it’s too cold, so the afternoon is a good way to hedge bets.' Dr . Mark Downs, Chief Executive of the Society of Biology, said: 'These . results show the power of data collected by volunteers. 'By looking out . for flying ants and taking a few minutes to fill out our survey they . have allowed us to do research which scientists couldn’t possibly do on . their own. Thank you to everyone who submitted their results.' Creatures of habit: The decision over whether to take to the skies seemed to be correlated with the weather. One factor which was consistent was the time at which the ants emerged, normally between 4pm and 6pm . Professor . Hart added: 'I’m really pleased with the data that everyone has helped . us to collect. We are going to be able to find out much more about this . natural phenomenon that seems to fascinate and appal people in equal . measure every summer.' Christina . Catlin-Groves, a PhD student at the University of Gloucestershire, . said: 'These findings are just the tip of the iceberg. 'At . the moment we just have one year’s worth of data and with the unusual . summer we have had we really need more years to let us build up the . bigger picture. 'It will be exciting to see what next year brings so please keep an eye out for Flying Ant Survey 2013.'","Study shows there were actually two flying ant days and large numbers reported over two flying ant weeks .

A retired businessman who owns one of Britain’s most important prehistoric monuments caused serious damage with illegal building work, a court heard. Roger Penny, 73, bought one of the four giant earthwork rings, known as Priddy Circles, as a pension investment. The rings – which date back to 3,000BC – are a Scheduled Ancient Monument built at the same time as Stonehenge. They have been described by English Heritage as ‘probable Neolithic ritual or ceremonial monuments similar to a henge’. Penny hired two contractors to ‘tidy’ and renovate the area, near the village of Priddy on Somerset’s Mendip Hills, but failed to get permission from English Heritage. One contractor used rubble to fill swallet holes, natural holes inside the ring which may be the key to its creation. Moving a gate led to agricultural machinery driving through the circle, making ruts, the court heard. Penny, from Litton, Somerset, admitted causing or permitting works to a scheduled monument without consent. He was ordered to pay £37,000  for restoration work, fined £2,500 and told to pay costs of £7,500. Prosecutor David Maunder told Taunton Crown Court: ‘These  circles are regarded as among a small group of the country’s most important prehistoric monuments, with enormous potential to inform us about the Neolithic period, and in archaeological terms are internationally significant.’ The court heard Penny bought a house and adjoining land, which included one of the rings. Monument: The Priddy Circle on Mr Penny's land. The brown areas show where the ring was damaged . He wanted to renovate and let the properties, and instructed  contractors to clear gorse and bracken, move a gate and help rebuild a wall. But he did so  without contacting English Heritage to ask for advice about how to carry out the work. He knew the circle was scheduled and told the contractors not to touch the ring, but because part  of the site is not visible to the naked eye ‘serious damage’ was caused. Charles Rowe, defending, said his client deeply regretted what had happened. Recorder Jeremy Wright told Penny: ‘Although the part you bought might not have been visually spectacular, commonsense would have told you the land inside the circle was also important.’","Roger Penny, 73, bought Priddy Circles, Somerset, as pension investment .

A mother who has suffered the agony of losing two babies to heart defects is urging people to sign up to the organ donor register to prevent further tragedies. Shelley Wealleans, 27, is racked with guilt for not agreeing to donate the organs of her first child, Lewis, who died when he was just three-months-old. The decision came back to haunt her eight years later when her third child, Mackenzie, needed a life-saving heart transplant - but died before one became available. Tragic: Shelley Wealleans has lost two babies to heart defects and is calling on more people to become organ donors . 'I wondered if it was payback for not donating Lewis’s organs. My guilt will stay with me for ever,' she told The Sun. Shelley, from Carlisle, was just 19 when she had Lewis with her ex-husband, Rob. He was born with a rare heart defect and died at the age of three months. Shelley was asked at the time if she wanted to donate her baby's organs but she refused 'without thinking'. 'I felt guilty knowing a mum in the past was . sitting feeling what I was' 'I didn’t know anything about . organ donation, so it was a shock. I was so angry and grief-stricken,' she said of her feelings at the time. She went on to have son, Corey, who is now seven, with Rob but they split up three years later. She then met her second husband Lee, 31, with whom she had son Mackenzie, but tragedy struck the mother again when his heart failed and he needed a transplant in order to survive. Praying for a heart donor for MacKenzie to be found made the mother rue the day she had refused to donate her first child's organs. Guilt-ridden: Shelley, pictured with son Corey, daughter Madison and husband Lee. She said she will never get over not donating son Lewis' organs as they could have saved another baby's life . She said: 'When Mackenzie fell ill I felt I was . as two-faced as they come. I felt guilty knowing a mum in the past was . sitting feeling what I was. 'I’d said no when I could’ve possibly saved a child’s life by simply saying yes. And then I needed someone else, another mother, to say yes for me.' 'I hoped that just one mum out there would have more strength and courage than I had' Doctors told her his condition was . different to Lewis' so it was due to terrible 'bad luck' and not . genetics that Shelley had two children with heart problems. Mackenzie was . placed at the top of the UK donor list because of his critical . condition but a donor was not found and in May last year he died just weeks before his . second birthday. She said: 'We waited 60 agonising days but a . donor heart couldn’t be found. It then hit me, the heartache another . poor woman had been forced to go through when I refused to donate . Lewis' organs. 'I hoped that just one mum out there would have more strength and courage than I had. I needed someone else, another mother, to say yes for me. But no one did.' Youngest on the list: Shelley added daughter Madison to the donor register when she was just 52 hours old . Shelley is now supporting the 'Promise Life' campaign to encourage people to sign up to the donor register so more lives may be saved in the future. She has already signed up daughter Madison, who was born in July this year. She said: 'When she was just 52 hours old I added her name to the organ donation list, making her the youngest person in the UK to be on it. 'My guilt will stay with me for ever but I hope that in telling my story other people will consider joining the donor register.'","Shelley Wealleans turned down the opportunity to donate the organs of her first baby, Lewis, when he died from a heart defect .

A trainee physics teacher has been declared the best Scrabble player in the UK, after a gruelling Bank Holiday weekend showdown. Kevin McMahon, from Dublin, clinched the crown when he managed to conjure up the word 'immortal' - taking advantage of two 'triple word score' squares to score 158 points. He was competing against 120 players at the British Matchplay Scrabble Championships, and claimed victory following a nail-biting 21 rounds. Final reckoning: The board that clinched Mr McMahon the title . Clincher: The eight-letter word 'immortal' secured victory . During the Great Depression, Scrabble was invented in 1938 by American-born architect Alfred Butts. He wanted to create a game that combined the vocabulary skills of crossword puzzles and anagrams, with the additional element of chance. The game was originally named Lexico, but Mr Butts eventually decided to call the game 'Criss-Cross Words.' The name was later changed to Scrabble and he sold the rights and it was trademarked in 1948 . The game is sold in 121 countries and there are 29 different language versions. Approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide. After winning the tournament at the Yarnfield Park Conference Centre in Staffordshire, Mr McMahon told The Independent: 'I'm really happy; it feels brilliant.' He collected a trophy and the £1,000 prize money, admitting that score of 158 with the word immortal 'sealed the deal'. 'I don't really play the words . for their beauty; I just do it for points,' he explained. The competition is the flagship event of the Association of British Scrabble Players. In Scrabble, players try to gain the highest points by making words with individual letter tiles on a grid board. Each letter tile has a points value between one and 10, based on the letter's frequency in standard English. Various coloured squares on the board can double or triple a player's points. The recent Scrabble tournaments coincides with new research by Scrabble into what makes words beautiful. Celebrities offering up their own favourite words include the actor and comedian Stephen Fry who suggested snuffle and Jamiroquai singer Jay Kay, who put forward whippersnapper, reported the newspaper.

The 18-week-old baby was born with incurable Epidermolysis Bullosa, a genetic condition . where the skin and internal body linings blister at the slightest knock . or rub, causing painful open wounds and blisters. Doctors had to . teach Daniela and husband Richard Brine how to hold their baby, in a way . that would stop him moving and hurting himself. Scroll down for video . Careful: Doctors had to teach Daniela and husband Richard Brine how to hold their baby, in a way that would stop him moving and hurting himself . Daniela said: 'We sort of learned how to hold him but any touching is very minimal. 'It’s heartbreaking I can’t give my beautiful boy a cuddle.' The parents have to stick . needles into their baby son to pop his blisters - but little Anthony . often gets them where his parents cannot treat them. She said: 'If he gets too hot he blisters - if he rubs against himself with his mittens he blisters. 'He blisters all the time - even the mittens we make him wear don’t help completely. 'It depends with how his body is but any rubbing or tension will cause horrible blisters. Desperate for a cuddle: Anthony shortly after he was born. The parents were devastated when the discovered they could not hold their son without protection . 'If we catch them early, we have to stick needles in to pop them. 'He does get them in his throat and inside his eyeballs which we can’t do anything about but feel sorry for him. 'He’s on paracetamol and codeine we have to give him every six hours so his pain level isn’t too high.' Much to Daniela and husband Richard’s distress, Anthony has a very high risk of developing skin cancer, as condition has knocked up to 40 years off his life expectancy, and there is no known effective treatment. Family and friends have begun fundraising for charity Debra, which is researching the condition to hopefully find a cure. Mum-of-two Daniela, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, is living in hope that one day they will find a cure.She said: 'We as parents will never be able to hug Anthony properly. 'Our older son Shane won’t be able to play with Anthony the way a normal big brother would. 'If Anthony knocks himself the skin peels away from the area and blisters form and just get bigger and bigger until they are popped. 'He’s in constant pain, not just the outside of his body but the inside as well.'She said blisters even form in Anthony’s throat and mouth making it painful to eat. Daniela said: 'Anthony always smiles. Happy little chap: The cheerful little boy's smile keeps his parents going despite the bleak outlook . 'He can be in so much pain, but once I’ve sorted him, he just smiles and that’s what keeps us going.”Anthony has to be held in a special way so he is unable to wriggle and damage his skin. Even five-year-old son Shane has been taught how to care for his little brother. Daniela said: 'My eldest is accident prone - he trips over his own feet all the time - I hope that Anthony isn’t the same. 'Shane knows he is not allowed to play with him as a brother. 'It is quite hard on him - we have to give Anthony so much more attention. 'Shane has learned that if Anthony is crying, mummy and daddy will spend a lot of time with him. 'He’s a trooper, like his little brother, he tells all his friends that ""my brother is ill.""'Blisters have to be popped and properly bandaged to prevent infection, and little Anthony has to wear his pyjamas inside out so his skin is not damaged by the seams. Daniela said Anthony’s hands and feet are the most severely affected areas of his little body, and he has to wear mittens to prevent him injuring himself. She said: 'The doctors say he will almost definitely get skin cancer and they say he will live about 30 years. 'We just go day by day, we’ve had all the bad news we can get.' Friends: The little boy cannot play with his favourite toys without his protective mitts on . Richard and Daniela have so far raised more than £1000 for charity Debra - who are working towards finding a cure for little Anthony’s debilitating condition. Sore to touch: Anthony Brine in hospital shortly after being born with the blisters caused by a gentle touch . Family and friends are selling charity pins, Richard and two pals recently completed the Yorkshire three peaks challenge and a local gym is organising a fancy-dress aerobics session. Anthony’s genetic condition is so bad that Daniela and Richard would never have any more children. She said: 'It’s hard not to feel guilty because Anthony’s condition is because of a specific gene me and Richard both have, and it’s an evil gene. 'Richard and I both have it and it’s a one in four chance our child will get it.“We’ll never have any other children - the illness is so horrible you wouldn’t wish it on your worst enemy.“There is nothing else we can do. We are just giving Anthony the best life he can.' Epidermolysis Bullosa affects only one in 50,000 people, and younger sufferers are known as ‘Butterfly Children’ because their skin is said to be as fragile as a butterfly’s wings. Once her maternity leave ends, Daniela will be quitting her job as a shopworker at Pets At Home so she can become a full-time carer for her little baby. Richard is currently training as a gas engineer after learning he is going to be made redundant from his current job next year. She said: 'We are making the best of it. 'We can cope somehow. 'Whenever Anthony is in so much pain and we think he can’t take it anymore, he’ll reach a point and stop and smile.

Gary Smith, GMB national officer, . said: ‘This is a classic case of reward for failure. This money came . from the hard-earned income of hard-pressed householders.’ He said the current hosepipe ban was . evidence of a long-term failure of management at Thames Water, which . stands accused of doing too little to capture the rainwater that falls . in the region.

Mr Baggs, whose family home is in Brighton, also gets a £15,000 car allowance and £2,300 for other unspecified expenses. Thames Water insisted that the rewards . for top executives are based on performance and match those of . companies of a similar size. It said: ‘Bonuses are only awarded if . we hit our operational and regulatory targets. For example, the . leakage-reduction goal was hit six years in a row, 100 per cent . compliance maintained at all our sewage works, best tap water quality of . all the major suppliers. ‘If these targets are missed then bonuses are not awarded.’ Thames Water reported a 13 per cent . drop in underlying pre-tax profits to £182.2million, which was driven by . higher bad debts and higher interest costs. The company has pledged to  spend nearly £5billion in the five years to 2015, which includes water and sewer pipe replacements. Mr Baggs said: ‘It may not seem like . it, but before this year’s very wet spring we had had the driest . two-year period on record in our region. ‘This meant we had to impose a . temporary use ban, or ‘hosepipe’ ban, to make sure we would have enough . water to go round, whatever the weather. ‘After many weeks of unusually wet and . miserable weather the situation is now a lot less serious and we expect . to be able to lift the hosepipe ban sooner rather than later.’ Industry sources believe the ban will . be lifted completely across the Thames Water and Anglian Water areas, . where reservoirs are 90-100 per cent full.

A cagefighter killed himself with poison after misreading an innocent message sent to his girlfriend, a coroner heard. Christopher Forkin, 23, of Waterfoot, Lancashire, swallowed a deadly amount of the substance after spotting the text on lover Paige Nuttall’s phone. During a furious row with the 21-year old, he tipped over his sofa and was pulling doors off their hinges telling her: 'You are just like the rest of them.' Tragic: Christopher Forkin took a deadly amount of poison after a row with his girlfriend Paige Nuttall . Miss Nuttall left his flat telling him to 'cool down' but when she came back, she found him dying on the floor. The 23-year-old was taken by ambulance to hospital but died later. The details of what was in the text were not revealed at his inquest. An inquest was told slaughterman Forkin, whose cage fights are posted to YouTube, could have taken the substance from a farm he worked at for several years. He and Paige had been in a relationship for just one month after they met on a night out in Rossendale, Lancs. Active: The martial arts enthusiast was found by Miss Nuttall after they had rowed over an innocent text message on her phone . Tragedy struck in March while the lovers were drinking at his flat in nearby Waterfoot. In a statement read out at Burnley coroners court, Miss Nuttall said father-of-two Forkin - had been 'mad' after reading the text messages on her phone. She said: 'I had left my phone lying around and he had seen some innocent messages from a friend. He tipped the couch over and was pulling the doors off the hinges. 'He was breaking things and crying but I managed to calm him down. He said ""you are just like the rest of them’. I told Chris that I was going out for some fags and left him at the house"".' Theory: Firkin may have taken the poison from the farm he worked on . But after she left  Forkin drank a 'substantial amount' of the poison which is used by farmers to kill vermin. Describing the moment she found Forkin face-down on his stomach when she returned, she said: 'When I left the house I realised that I had no money, I went back to the flat to find Chris on the floor and I said ""what have you taken?"". 'His fist was clenched and he was shaking and fitting. I put my finger in his mouth so that he wouldn’t swallow his tongue. 'I was hysterical and remember him saying ""remember I love you"".' She called paramedics who took Forkin to Royal Blackburn Hospital were he later died. Fire crews from the hazardous materials unit in Burnley attended the scene as a precautionary measure in case the property needed to be decontaminated. Farmer Frank Ainsworth, who employed Forkin said his employee would have known the substance could be fatal but he said he was unaware any bottles were missing from his store. Mr Ashworth said: 'Christopher was a polite, trustworthy and reliable worker. He liked a drink and was quiet when he was sober but not when he was drunk. 'He knew that the poison was fatal and we had used it on the lambs to poison foxes.' Forkin had recently taken up martial arts training at Waterfoot-based Team Warriors Elite and had been due to take part in a cage fight event.

We can’t understand why this has happened. 'He always had a huge smile on his face whatever the situation. He was such a nice person and a pleasure to train, a very valuable member of the team.' Danny Brelsford who trained with Forkin added: 'I had been training with Chris during the daytime. He was honestly one of the nicest people I have ever met. 'He was known for his infectious smile and his positive carefree attitude. He will be greatly missed.'

Clint Eastwood's empty-chair speech at the Republican National Convention may have swung a few voters but the act didn't convince his own daughter to vote for Mitt Romney. Francesca Eastwood has revealed that President Barack Obama will win her support when she heads to the polling booth on November 6. 'I happen to not be voting for the same man,' she said of her dad as she left the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood. 'But I love that he stands up for what he believes in.' TMZ quizzed the 19-year-old on whether she had the same political leanings as her legendary movie star and director father. Eastwood is a vocal Republican and used his prime time speaking slot at the conservative conference to interrogate an empty chair, that was supposed to be Obama. The address started an internet craze known as 'Eastwooding' where thousands of pictures of people pointing at all sorts of empty chairs were uploaded on the internet. The peculiar speech was criticised for overshadowing the Republican presidential candidate's own speech, but Eastwood defended his performance. 'If somebody's dumb enough to ask me to go to a political convention and say something, they're gonna have to take what they get,' Eastwood said in an interview with Extra. 'People loved it or hated it and that’s fine,' he added. 'That's what it was supposed to be.'

A desperate wife threw herself on to her bloodied husband to save his life as three thugs took turns kicking him in a 'stomach churning' attack. Richard Weston, 47, was assaulted in the street, his face left ‘pulverised’, as the thugs set on him until they were 'too tired to kick any more'. Dwayne Mears, 30, Lewis Downham, 24, and Shane Hurst, 24, were all jailed for the brutal attack which the judge at Lincoln Crown Court called the worst assault he had seen. Mr Weston’s hysterical wife Tina, 50, . tried to intervene ‘to save his life’ during the attack in Sutton . Bridge, Lincolnshire, the court heard. 'Stomach churning attack': Dwayne Mears (left) and Lewis Downham (right) were jailed for two and a half years, and two years respectively for the attack on Richard Weston which left his face 'pulverised.' Shown remorse: Shane Hurst, also jailed for the attack, was not the instigator and had shown remorse, his lawyer said in court . After punching Mr Weston to the ground the trio began booting him in the face and body and only stopped when one of them joked: ‘I can’t kick any more. I’m tired.’ Prosecutor David Outterside said the trio ‘seemed to be loving it’. Jailing Mears for two and a half years, Downham for two and Hurst for 21 months, Judge Sean Morris said: ‘You pleaded guilty to one of the worst affrays it has been my misfortune to see. ‘This was the most stomach churning attack. What happened on that night beggar’s belief.’ The trio pounced on Mr Weston as he walked home with his friend Dean Bunn and their wives after a night out. Mr Outterside said they were approached by a group of up to eight men led by Downham. He said: ‘Downham punched Dean Bunn to the head and as he went to the floor he was kicked and punched. ‘Richard Weston tried to intervene. The attacking group them turned their attention to him. ‘Dwayne Mears punched Mr Weston first and then the two co-accused joined in. ‘Mr Weston was knocked to the ground and was kicked while he lay unconscious on the ground. ‘They took it in turns to kick him. All were in it as much as each other. ‘Tina Weston threw herself on her husband to save his life and to stop them kicking him. ‘A bystander described them as laughing and joking throughout.

The attackers fled but were later arrested. The three all pleaded guilty to affray and were sentenced on October 5. Philip Farr, defending Mears, said he had a good work ethic and had been doing his best to stay out of trouble. Vedrana Pehar, who represented Downham, said he had difficulty dealing with anger management, adding: ‘He describes himself as being ashamed of his actions.’ Lawrence Bruce, for Hurst, said he was not the instigator and has since shown remorse.","Richard Weston was attacked in the street by three men .

They were adopted into a life of bitter custody disputes and murderous affairs, but the Ammon twins have said they are thankful a wealthy U.S. couple took them in otherwise they would have died in a Ukrainian orphanage. Greg and Alexa Ammon, now 22, were adopted as children by multimillionaire financier Ted Ammon and his wife Generosa and whisked away to the couple's luxurious mansion in the East Hamptons. But years later, the twins were . left without parents for a second time after their mother's lover bludgeoned their father to death in October 2011 and she died two years later from breast cancer. Despite enduring tragedies which graced the pages of newspapers across the country for years, the twins said they are grateful to the Ammons. Thankful: Greg and Alexa Ammon, 22, have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered after the murder of their father by their mother's lover in 2001 - but said the family saved them . 'I'm thankful for all that my parents . gave us,' Alexa told People Magazine. 'If they hadn't adopted me, I probably would have died in the . orphanage. They literally gave me life.' The Ammon twins, who grew apart and moved to opposite coasts following the tragedies, have now returned to the house where their father was murdered as part of a documentary about their lives. 'We had to face our fears, face the house, face the bedroom and everything that happened there,' Greg told People Magazine. They . revisit the family home, which they still own, in the film, and recall . the months of emotional abuse from their mother as their parents went . through a bitter divorce. Unhappy families: The twins are pictured with their adoptive father Ted and mother Generosa . Saved: The children had been adopted by the wealthy couple from an orphanage in the Ukraine . She would make them steal documents . from their father and then allow them to watch television as a reward. But if they said they had had fun with him, they would be sent directly . to their room. 'I remember Mom, but all I remember are the bad things,' Greg says in the film. The twins, then 11, were at their father's house in Manhattan when the 52-year-old was killed in the bedroom of their home, as he continued to fight the divorce and custody battles with his wife. The twins recalled the moment they learned of his death in their documentary, 59 Middle Lane. 'You wake up in the morning, get dressed . like a normal day and Aunt Sandi comes in, and Aunt Sandi, of course, . lives in Alabama, and we are like why are you here,' Greg recalled. At the time of his death, the Ammons . had not finalised their divorce and Ted had yet to re-write his will, . leaving his estranged wife with half of his fortune, estimated to be . around $80 million. Family: Alexa and Greg Ammon lived on opposite coasts but reunited for the film to trace their roots . Old life: In the film, they return to the Ukrainian orphanage and say they'd have died if they were not adopted . Her lover, an electrician from Long Island named Danny Pelosi, was suspected of the murder but lived as a free man for years - and the twins admitted they loved him. Murdered: In October 2001, Ted Ammon was found bludgeoned to death at their Hamptons home . 'When Danny entered our lives, it was amazing to have a new man to take us out and play baseball with us,' Alexa said. Three . months after Ted Ammon was murdered, Pelosi divorced his wife and . married Generosa. They lived in Ammon's mansion before moving to . Pelosi's home in Long Island. Generosa had little time to enjoy her former husband's wealth, however, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in August 2003. The children went to live with their aunt in Alabama. Pelosi, who had been battling for a . part of the fortune left by his late wife, was eventually arrested in . March 2004 and was found guilty of murder. He has maintained that Generosa hired a hit man to kill her husband. He will not be eligible for parole until 2031. When they faced him in court, aged 14, the twins were unforgiving towards the man they once loved. 'I hope you suffer and go through . just as much as my sister and I have,' Greg said at his sentencing, the New York Post reported. 'I just hope God can forgive you, because I certainly won’t.' 'It's hard to realise that the person . you loved stabbed you in the back and ruined the rest of your life. You . are a sick man, and I regret every single time I said I loved you.' Scene: In the film, the twins return to the bedroom where he was found after being tortured and killed . Lavish: They still own the mansion in East Hampton where their father was found dead . His sister added: 'Mr. Pelosi might have had a nice time . for the past couple of years spending my parents' money, but that is . over now, and I hope he rots away in prison because he deserves nothing . better.' Greg eventually moved to Los Angeles and started a film production company while Alexa managed a band in South Carolina - but came back together to film the documentary for closure. The twins, who inherited $1 . million each after taxes and attorneys' fees, also decided to use the . opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family in the Ukraine. Searching . through documents at the mansion, they find papers leading them to the . orphanage from where they were adopted as malnourished . children. They learn that . they were the result of a one-night tryst between their mother and a . soldier. The government then took them from their mother as she . struggled with alcoholism and mental problems. Emotion: Greg reveals they made the documentary for closure 'to end all the horrible things that happened' Killer: Daniel Pelosi was arrested for the murder in 2004 and will not be eligible for parole until 2031. He married Generosa Ammon three months after the death of her husband . She was also a prostitute, who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol. She died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children, some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins. The documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in Moscow. 'Ultimately, that story in the . Ukraine is very similar to our story in America,' Greg told The East . Hampton Press. 'When I’m speaking about our birth mother, I’m speaking . about my adopted mother, too. I try to tell both of their stories.' The film has already premiered at the .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:09 EST, 24 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:44 EST, 24 October 2012 . Chancellor George Osborne's plans to claw back child benefit from better-off families have been criticised for being too complicated . Thousands of people earning more than £50,000 will lose some of their pay if they move in with a new partner who has children, accountants have warned. Tax experts at Deloitte said the ‘bizarre’ anomaly was the result of government plans to claw back child benefit from homes where at least one resident is a higher earner. The changes are due to come into force in just 10 weeks, and the Treasury has been forced to insist they remain on track despite hundreds of thousands of families affected being in the dark that they will lose money from January 1. Letters are due to be sent to all those paid under PAYE and earning more than £50,000 by HM Revenue and Customs next week. Yesterday MailOnline revealed child benefit is being paid to 40,000 children living outside the UK, despite plans to cut the money for families in the UK. Under the changes, if one person in the home earns £50,000 or more, the entitlement to child benefit will be gradually cut. If anyone earns more than £60,000, they will lose child benefit all together. But instead of reducing the amount of child benefit paid out, the money is to be clawed back in additional tax imposed on the higher earner, regardless of whether they are the person who receives child benefit or even a parent. It means 500,000 people will have to fill out self-assessment tax forms for the first time. Patricia Mock, a tax director in Deloitte’s private client services division, said: ‘If you have a standard family with 2.4 children and two married parents all living together then the system is reasonably straightforward. ‘But it can get really bizarre. Take that straightforward family. If the parents get divorced and the children live with the mother who has a new partner, and that partner is the higher earner, then he gets [to pay] the clawback even though they are not his children,’ she told the Daily Telegraph. Ms Mock added: ‘Some scenarios look overcomplicated, but in today’s complex family arrangements, they may well happen.' If an estranged father is claiming child benefit for children who live with their mother and this father has a new partner – who happens to earn more than him – then this partner may be liable to pay the money back if they earn over the threshold. A spokesman for HMRC insisted the process of explaining the changes was on course, but admitted new partners could be liable for the charge following a divorce. He added: ‘Letters explaining the new child benefit rules are ready to be sent and will be issued in batches from next week, on schedule and according to plan. 'There are no delays, and plenty of time for those affected to consider their options and make an informed choice in time for the 7 January rule change. ‘We will also launch a section on our website designed specifically to help taxpayers with the new arrangements.’","George Osborne is to claw back child benefit from homes where someone earns more than £50,000 .

"By . Jonathan Margolis . PUBLISHED: . 18:45 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:08 EST, 4 October 2012 . Plenty of television innovations have come along over the years, promising to ‘change for ever’ our viewing habits. First came colour pictures on BBC2 in 1967. Then it was Sky. Next there was Freeview. 3D was hailed as the next breakthrough. TV on your mobile phone was another. But, as yet, few have matched the popularity of multi-channel packages. Now, though, the new YouView system is being touted as the technology that could change the way we watch TV. Scroll down for video . Innovation: The new YouView system enables viewers to make use of TV catch-up services regardless of their computer skills . The principle of the system is, like all the best ideas, simple and intriguing. While iPlayer from the BBC and the equivalent catch-up services from other broadcasters enable you to view shows you’ve missed, they involve a modicum of basic computer skills. For those people who are able to grasp these, it’s also possible to connect a laptop showing iPlayer to your TV. But YouView has for the first time integrated standard TV and internet TV in a more or less seamless way, so archived programmes on these ‘catch-up’ services can be fed into your living room TV regardless of your computer skills. The main advantage of YouView is that it has an on-screen guide (accessible at the touch of a button), showing programmes that were screened during the past seven days as well as those due to be broadcast over the next seven days on all the main channels. Even the dreaded ‘buffering’, the frustrating intermittent delay often experienced while programmes download to a computer, has largely been done away with. And by removing all the hassles involved in using the TV stations’ already available catch-up services, YouView has pulled off the trick much-loved by clever firms — taking a technology that’s already proven and adding a bit of magic to make it easy to use and desirable. In fact, being able to go back in time on your programme guide already exists on Virgin Media, but the launch of YouView is expected to see it really take off. The YouView system has for the first time integrated standard TV and internet TV in a 'more or less seamless' way . YouView has other benefits. The main one is that it gets you a wider variety of channels than a standard Freeview box, but without any subscription charges. YouView offers more than 70 TV and radio channels, some in high definition, as well as a further 300 so-called ‘content providers’, such as Amazon’s Lovefilm (the online film rental service), which are in the process of joining the service. Lovefilm has already announced as a first step that anyone subscribing to a phone and internet package with TalkTalk who opts for a YouView box will get 12 months access to its film and television library. Newly released films and paid-for sports events will also soon be available on a pay-as-you-go basis - and without the need for a satellite dish. However, the major drawback to YouView is that even though there are no subscriptions to pay, it will be expensive to get the initial equipment. The YouView set top box currently being sold costs £299. But these start-up costs are expected to soon come down. Many internet service providers — such as BT and TalkTalk - will soon be offering a YouView box as part of their broadband deal, typically for no more than a £50 charge. Existing BT and TalkTalk customers will be offered a £50 upgrade to the new box. So if you think you would benefit from YouView’s ‘TV time traveller’ facility - and you baulk at those expensive Sky and Virgin subscriptions - is YouView the innovation for you? Here are a few questions you may be asking . . . So is this cable, satellite or what?YouView is neither and requires no drilling or messy installation. Presuming you have a good outdoor aerial, you can access the 70 or so Freeview channels with no fuss. To get full use of the service, however, you’ll need a broadband connection running at a minimum speed of 3 Mbps — which is not yet available in some rural areas. Ideally, you’ll need 5 Mbps. If you have a satellite dish but no longer have an aerial, you would need to get one installed — and check that there’s a good old-fashioned TV signal in your area — not always the case in some parts of the countryside. Will it work with an older TV?Yes, but they won’t allow you to experience the box’s high definition (HD) capabilities. How many channels can it get? YouView gets all the 74 Freeview channels, plus a lot of radio stations. Then, apart from the programme guide, there’s a section called On Demand, where you can find iPlayer and all the other main catch-up websites. Hundreds of other channels are planning to set up in the On Demand section. Can it get Sky Sports?This is the big question - especially for many men. The answer is ‘no’ - unless you get your YouView box by subscribing to TalkTalk and signing up for their broadband deal, on which you can pay for Sky Sports one to four. If you get YouView through BT, or buy a box outright in a High Street shop, you can’t yet get Sky Sports. Does it bump up internet costs?Yes - it’s important to check your current broadband contract doesn’t have a data limit. Older broadband contracts didn’t envisage people getting most of their TV from the internet, and downloading, say, an HD film could use 3Gb — which may be a large part of your monthly data allowance, after which you will be surcharged. The kind of broadband contracts offered with a new YouView box will offer unlimited data. What if you’ve got two or more TV sets?The YouView box works only with one TV; if you want YouView in other rooms, you’ll need to buy more boxes. Several boxes can ‘feed’ off one broadband connection, but the wiring required is complex and you’ll need to pay an engineer to fix it. Is it worth buying now, or is it best to wait?Now is fine if you don’t mind the steep initial price. Because the box is internet connected, any upgrades will be made automatically by YouView, so new features — such as the crucial Sky Sports — will be added to your box. Can I control what my kids watch?Yes, and also, if you try to watch something recorded after the watershed in daylight hours, a warning will flash up and a PIN number will be requested — which hopefully your children won’t know. So what are YouView’s drawbacks? Not many - something which worries the likes of Sky. No wonder Rupert Murdoch initially tried to block YouView setting up. One current niggle is that the first box launched doesn’t have built-in Wi-Fi, meaning you have to plug it into your router. Of course this is not very convenient though, and a strange oversight, since so many millions of homes have Wi-Fi.","New YouView system allows viewers to access broadcasters' catch-up services through their TV without the need for computer skills .

Instead, the singer, who is divorced from footballer Ashley Cole, says she still believes in the sanctity of the institution, calling it a ‘bond for life’. The 28-year-old spoke out as she revealed she is backing same-sex marriage, which the Government is currently drawing up plans to legalise – despite strong criticism from the Church of England. Divorcee: Yet pop singer Cheryl Cole still believes in the sanctity of marriage, she said as she revealed she is backing plans for the legalisation of gay marriage . Her marriage to the Chelsea player ended in 2010, following allegations he had cheated on her with five women. In a radio interview, she said: ‘Marriage is far more than a man and a woman, you know. It’s a bond for life and whether you’re gay or straight or whatever, it makes no difference to being married. What marriage stands for is that you love that person. ‘You want to commit yourself to that person forever. All the rights that a marriage gives you, why should the fact that you are attracted to the same sex make that any different? It makes no sense to me. The same relationship, the same beliefs ...

"By . Katy Dartford . PUBLISHED: . 05:46 EST, 29 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 29 October 2012 . Facebook is increasingly being used to kidnap Indonesian children who are shipped off to a life of slavery in brothels, say child protection teams. This year alone, 27 of the 129 . children reported missing to Indonesia's National Commission for Child . Protection are believed to have been abducted after meeting their . captors on Facebook. One of those befriended on the social media site has also been found dead. Facebook chat: There are growing numbers of incidents involving social media networks being used as a means for children trafficking in Indonesia . A month since a girl kidnapped from her home on the outskirts of Jakarta, was . found near a bus terminal on September the 30th, there have been at least seven . reports of young girls in Indonesia being abducted by people they met on . Facebook. The 14-year-old girl says she . received a Facebook friend request from an older man she didn't know, so . she accepted it out of curiosity. The junior high student was quickly smitten by the man's smooth online flattery. She didn't realise that he was one of the growing number of sexual predators who had found a new way to exploit Indonesia's increasing obsession with social . media. They exchanged phone numbers, and . his attention increased with rapid-fire texts. He convinced her to meet . in a mall, and she found him just as charming in person. They agreed to meet again. After . telling her mom she was going to visit a sick girlfriend on her way to . church choir practice, she climbed into the man's minivan near her home . in Depok. The man, a 24-year-old who called . himself Yogi, drove her an hour to the town of Bogor, West Java, she . told The Associated Press in an interview. There, he locked her in a small room inside a house with at least five other girls aged 14 to 17. She was drugged and raped repeatedly - losing her virginity in the first violent session. After one week of torture, her captor . told her she was being sold and shipped to the faraway island of Batam, . known for its seedy brothels and child sex tourism that caters to men . coming by boat from nearby Singapore. She sobbed hysterically and begged to go home. She was beaten and told to shut up or die. Although no solid data exists, police . and aid groups that work on trafficking issues say it seems to be a . particularly big problem in the Southeast Asian archipelago. 'Maybe Indonesia is kind of a unique country so far,' said Anjan Bose, a program officer who works on . child online protection issues at ECPAT International, a nonprofit . global network that helps children in 70 countries. 'Once the reports start coming in, . you will know that maybe it's not one of the countries, maybe it's one . of a hundred countries. 'The Internet is such a global . medium. It doesn't differentiate between poor and rich. It doesn't . differentiate between the economy of the country or the culture.' Websites that track social media say . Indonesia has nearly 50 million people signed up for Facebook, making it . one of the world's top users after the U.S. The capital, Jakarta, was recently named the most active Twitter city by Paris-based social media monitoring company Semiocast. In addition, networking groups such as BlackBerry and Yahoo Messenger are wildly popular on mobile phones. There are at least eight reported incidents this month alone in Indonesia of young girls being abducted and enslaved by men who approached them randomly on Facebook . Many young Indonesians, and their . parents, are unaware of the dangers of allowing strangers to see their . personal information online. Teenagers frequently post photos and . personal details such as their home address, phone number, school and . hangouts without using any privacy settings - allowing anyone trolling . the net to find them and learn everything about them. 'We are racing against time, and the technology frenzy over Facebook is a trend among teenagers here,' Sirait said. 'Police should move faster, or many more girls will become victims.' The 27 Facebook-related abductions . reported to the commission this year in Indonesia have already exceed 18 . similar cases it received in all of 2011. Overall, the National Task Force . Against Human Trafficking said 435 children were trafficked last year, . mostly for sexual exploitation. Many who fight child sex crimes in Indonesia believe the real numbers are much higher. Missing children are often not reported to authorities. Stigma and shame surround sexual . abuse in the world's largest Muslim-majority country, and there's a . widespread belief that police will do nothing to help. An ECPAT International report . estimates that each year, 40,000 to 70,000 children are involved in . trafficking, pornography or prostitution in Indonesia, a nation of 240 . million where many families remain impoverished. The U.S. State Department has also warned that more Indonesian girls are being recruited using social media networks. In a report last year, it said . traffickers have 'resorted to outright kidnapping of girls and young . women for sex trafficking within the country and abroad.' Online child sexual abuse and exploitation are common in much of Asia. In the Philippines, kids are being . forced to strip or perform sex acts on live webcams - often by their . parents, who are using them as a source of income. Western men typically . pay to use the sites. 'In the Philippines, this is the tip of the iceberg. It's not only Facebook and social . media, but it's also through text messages ... especially young, . vulnerable people are being targeted,' said Leonarda Kling, regional . representative for Terre des Hommes Netherlands, a nonprofit working on . trafficking issues. 'It's all about promises. Better jobs or maybe even a nice telephone or whatever. Young people now, you see all the . glamour and glitter around you and they want to have the latest . BlackBerry, the latest fashion, and it's also a way to get these . things.' Facebook says its investigators . regularly review content on the site and work with authorities, . including Interpol, to combat illegal activity. It also has employees around the world tasked with cracking down on people who attempt to use the site for human trafficking. 'We take human trafficking very . seriously and, while this behavior is not common on Facebook, a number . of measures are in place to counter this activity,' spokesman Andrew . Noyes said in an email. He declined to give any details on Facebook's involvement in trafficking cases reported in Indonesia or elsewhere . There are fears that the overall number of trafficked children remains grossly underestimated in Indonesia . The Depok girl, wearing a mask to . hide her face as she was interviewed, said she is still shocked that the . man she knew for nearly a month turned on her. 'He wanted to buy new clothes for me, and help with school payments. He was different ... that's all,' she said. 'I have a lot of contacts through Facebook, and I've also exchanged phone numbers. But everything has always gone fine. We were just friends.' She said that after being kidnapped, she was given sleeping pills and was 'mostly unconscious' for her ordeal. She said she could not escape because a man and another girl stood guard over her. The girl said the man did not have . the money for a plane ticket to Batam, and also became aware that her . parents and others were relentlessly searching for her. He ended up dumping her at a bus station, where she found help. 'I am angry and cannot accept what he . did to me. ... I was raped and beaten!' said the lanky girl with . shoulder-length black hair. The United Nations estimates that 80% of persons trafficked are trafficked for sexual exploitation. They are mostly women and children. (UN, 2003).An estimated 120,000 women and children are trafficked into Western Europe each year. (European Commission, 2001).800,000 people are trafficked across borders every year, of whom 80% are women and girls and some 50% are minors. (US Dept of State, 2005)9.8m are involved in unpaid work or prostitutionThe annual human trafficking industry is worth almost £20 billionSource: Congressional research Service / UN Global report on Trafficking . The girl's case made headlines this month when she was expelled after she tried to return to school. Officials at the school reportedly claimed she had tarnished its image. She has since been reinstated, but she no longer wishes to attend due to the stigma she faces. Education Minister Mohammad Nuh also . came under fire after making remarks that not all girls who report such . crimes are victims:'They do it for fun, and then the girl alleges that . it's rape,' he said. His response to the criticism was that it's difficult to prove whether sexual assault allegations are 'real rapes.' The publicity surrounding the story . encouraged the parents of five other missing girls to come forward this . month, saying their daughters also were victimized by people they met on . Facebook. Two more girls were freed from their captors in October and are now seeking counseling. A man who posed as a photographer on Facebook was recently arrested and accused of kidnapping and raping three teenage girls. Authorities say he lured them into meeting him with him by promising to make them models, and then locked them in a house. Police found dozens of photos of naked girls on his camera and laptop. Another case involved a 15-year-old girl from Bogor. She was recently rescued by police . after being kidnapped by her Facebook 'friend' and held at a restaurant, . waiting for someone to move her to another town where she would be . forced into prostitution. In some incidents, the victims . themselves ended up recruiting other young girls after being promised . money or luxuries such as mobile phones or new clothes. Police are trying to get a step ahead of the criminals. Detective Lt. Ruth Yeni Qomariah . from the Children and Women's Protection unit in Surabaya said she posed . as a teenager online and busted three men who used Facebook to kidnap . and rape underage girls. She's searching for a fourth suspect. 'It has been getting worse as . trafficking rings become more sophisticated and underage children are . more easily targeted,' she said. The man who abducted the Depok girl . has not been found, and it's unclear what happened to the five other . girls held at the house where she was raped. 'I saw they were offered by my kidnapper to many guys,' she said. 'I don't know what happened. I don't want to remember it.'","27 Facebook-related abductions .

Greece's new finance minister was rushed to hospital today after fainting - as eurozone leaders agreed to push for a €130billion growth package at next week's key European Union summit. Vassilis Rapanos, 65, was taken to a private Athens hospital where he is undergoing tests and is likely to be under observation for at least two or three days. The incident came as the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Spain met in Rome to find a way to pull Europe out of its crippling debt crisis. Now hospitalised: This photograph, taken on Thursday, shows Greek Finance Minister Vassilis Rapanos attending the new Government's first cabinet meeting at the Greek Parliament in Athens . Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said the message the four leaders wanted to come out of next week's EU summit is that the euro will survive. He said: 'We expect the conclusions of the EU summit will be more solid and credible compared with previous summits as far as growth is concerned.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Monti also want the June 28-29 summit to come up with a 'clear medium- and long-term vision for greater integration' in the eurozone, he said. Finally, next week's summit should 'put at ease the financial markets expectations', he said before shifting into English from Italian to add 'that the euro is here to stay and we all mean it.' At odds: German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and French President Francois Hollande (right) disagree over how the eurozone should proceed . It has seen world markets dip. The . FTSE 100 is 0.93 per cent down at 5,514.61; Germany's DAX is 0.93 per . cent down at  6,284.31; and France's CAC 40 is 0.50 per cent down at . 3,098.75. Monti had earlier said next week's . summit was a 'defining moment' and that, without it being a success, . Italy and Spain may be pushed closer to eventually needing sovereign . bailouts. He added: 'A large part of Europe . would find itself having to continue to put up with very high interest . rates that would then impact on the states and also indirectly on firms. 'This is the direct opposite of what is needed for economic growth.' German chancellor Angela Merkel had been expected to resist any pressure from Monti, French President Francois Hollande and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy for less stringent eurozone fiscal policies or the issuance of common eurozone bonds. But after a meeting of eurozone finance ministers late last night, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde demanded rapid progress on a number of other fronts, raising the heat on Merkel. Respite: Dangerously high borrowing costs for Spain and Italy have eased a little on market hopes for policy initiatives at the Brussels summit on June 28/29 . Lagarde said a banking union was a top priority, alongside fiscal union and the principle of mutualising debt. Germany refuses to countenance common bond issuance and will not soften until economic union is complete. It is also opposed to the early introduction of a bloc-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme. While Spain's needs are most pressing - its medium term borrowing costs hit a euro era high at auction yesterday - the political stakes may be higher for Italy's unelected technocrat prime minister, Mario Monti. With his popularity sinking, the parties that back Monti in parliament are increasingly reluctant to support his reform proposals at home, but demand he get results in the European arena to ease the pressure on Italy's recession-bound economy. 'Monti knows he has to get his ducks in a row on the European side so he can tell the parties that he's sorted that part out, and now it's their turn to help sort out Italy,' said James Walston, politics professor at the American University in Rome. 'Friday's summit is important for Monti in symbolic terms because it shows Italians that he is centre-stage.' Though hugely popular when he came to office in November, his approval rating has halved as tax hikes and pension cuts exacerbated an already severe recession, and his labour reform estranged both unions and the business establishment. But for the markets, Monti remains the man most likely to tackle Italy's debt mountain and uncompetitiveness.If he comes under serious threat, Italy could quickly supplant Spain as the euro zone's main flashpoint. Warm welcome: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne (left) kisses Danish Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager (right) during the finance ministers meeting today . Monti's hand was weakened by comments on Wednesday by his predecessor, Silvio Berlusconi, who said the prospect of Italy quitting the euro was 'not blasphemy' and that he failed to understand why it would hurt Italy's economy. Berlusconi's People of Freedom party is one of the two main groups that guarantee Monti a majority in parliament. 'The best that Monti and Rajoy will get from Merkel at this meeting is talk,' said Nicholas Spiro of Spiro Sovereign Strategy. Crucial: Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti (right) has said the summits are a 'defining moment' However, with 10-year Spanish bond yields having already fallen by more than 0.7 percentage points from recent highs, he said that ahead of next week's summit even vaguely supportive comments from Merkel may be enough to underpin the market. The two hour meeting will start at 12noon. It will be followed by a joint news conference by the four leaders. No joint statement is expected. Monti, who presents himself as a mediator between France and Germany, has insisted for months that the eurozone must temper the German-led austerity drive with measures to foster growth. That position is shared by Hollande and Rajoy, but when the Italian leader has tried to transform his pro-growth rhetoric into policy prescriptions for the eurozone his ideas have generally met a cool response from Merkel. He proposed on the sidelines of this week's G20 summit using the eurozone's rescue funds to buy the bonds of Spain and Italy in the secondary market to bring down their borrowing costs. Monti will raise it again in Rome. Spain's Foreign Minister José Manuel Garcia-Margallo called the idea 'intelligent'. But Merkel played down the plan, which investors said might be counter-productive unless the European Central Bank stepped in decisively in support. Other proposals from Monti, such as stripping some forms of public investment from budget deficit calculations, or commonly issued euro zone bonds, are also broadly supported by France and Spain but opposed by Germany, at least for now.

A blood test that can spot hidden liver damage has been developed by British doctors. They hope it could soon be used by GPs to identify patients at risk of life-threatening liver disease before it is too late. The number of Britons dying from liver disease has reached record levels, up by a quarter in a decade to more than 11,500 a year. This is largely thought to be due to high levels of binge drinking and obesity. One reason liver disease is so dangerous is that it is very difficult to diagnose and patients may not have symptoms until the organ starts to fail. But a team of researchers from Southampton University claim their new blood test – more detailed and precise than existing tests – can successfully pinpoint patients at high risk. Such patients could then be encouraged to reform their lifestyles or be put on medication. The ‘traffic light’ test analyses indicators in patients’ blood, which will change if the liver has been damaged. It combines a routine liver test, already in use, with two others measuring the level of fibrosis, or scarring. Patients are then given a colour based on their risk with red meaning it is high, amber intermediate and green low. The test has already been trialled on more than 1,000 patients with liver disease and researchers claim it was successfully able to pinpoint whether their liver was damaged. Cirrhosis of the liver magnified: Cirrhosis may not be accompanied by any symptoms which means the disease is not diagnosed until too late . They hope that in future it will be routinely used by GPs on patients who drink heavily or those who are very overweight. Dr Nick Sheron, who devised the test, said: ‘It is a powerful tool and message for people. ‘We can say, “Amber means we can’t be absolutely sure but there is at least a 50:50 chance that you have a scarred liver, and there is a significant possibility that you could die of it within 5 years”. ‘We find that for most patients this is a pretty good stimulus to stop drinking or at least to cut down to safe levels.’ He said that liver disease ‘develops silently’, adding: ‘There are no signs or symptoms – the liver has no pain fibres until disease is very far advanced. Powerful tool: Dr Nick Sheron, left, devised the test which he says is a 'message for people' to detect liver disease which 'may prove really useful' according to Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, right . ‘By the time the patient presents to hospital the liver is often very scarred.’ Dr Sheron, whose study is published in the British Journal of General Practice, said most patients were keen to take the test. ‘People are immensely curious about if their alcohol intake is doing any harm,’ he said. Study co-author and GP Dr Michael Moore said: ‘The traffic light test has the advantage of highlighting those at highest risk who should be investigated further and those in whom the risk is much lower where a watchful approach is more appropriate.’ Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, said: ‘One of the challenges of liver disease, which is rising dramatically in this country, is the silent nature of the condition until it is often too late to reverse the damage. ‘This large study from Sheron and colleagues in Southampton may prove really useful for guiding the right patients towards specialist care in a timely way.’","Liver disease develops silently and so it remains undiagnosed often until it is too late .

A father used a needle and thread to sew his son's buttocks shut in a bizarre attempt to cure his Crohn's Disease. Randy Swopes, 52, decided to try the radical DIY surgery after the 14-year-old developed a cavity in his bottom as a result of the illness. But his efforts led to the wound becoming infected and the teenager was hospitalised for almost a month. Extreme solution: Rather than take his son to hospital, Randy Swopes attempted DIY surgery on the boy at his home in Waukegan, Illinois . Inconceivable: Swopes avoided jail after using a needle and thread to sew up the fistula - or cavity - connecting his son's skin and rectum . Swopes, from Waukegan, Illinois,  was charged with aggravated battery, but took a plea deal that kept him out of prison, according to the Lake County New-Sun. He could have spent two to five years in jail, had he been convicted of the offence. Crohn’s Disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine or the large intestine. Common symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss. Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system, resulting in complications, such as narrowing of the colon. There is no cure for the disease, but medication can reduce symptoms. Around 60-75 per cent of people with Crohn’s disease need surgery to relieve symptoms, repair damage to their digestive system and treat related complications. Crohn’s Disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the digestive system, in which the body’s immune system destroys healthy tissue. It can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fevers, stomach pain and complications included bowel obstruction. As a result of the unpleasant disease, the 14-year-old boy had developed a fistula. This affects around 25 per cent of people who have Crohn's, and is an abnormal channel that forms between the rectum and nearby skin - for example, on the buttock. Depending on the severity of the fistula, proper treatment may involve a combination of antibiotics and surgery to drain the abscess. Swopes took an Alford plea at court on Friday, which admits that there is enough evidence to convict but is not a direct admission of guilt, said Assistant State’s Attorney Danielle Pascucci. He was sentenced to 24 months of probation and 250 hours of public service for the episode in January 2008.","DIY surgery led to a serious infection .

"PUBLISHED: . 06:03 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:46 EST, 22 October 2012 . When a pilot asked Pam Sheldon for permission to land his vintage 1930s plane on her field, the amateur photographer thought it was a perfect opportunity to hone her camera skills. In fact, the 36-year-old care worker ended up lowering her lens to watch in horror as the Tiger Moth biplane clipped a tree and crash landed in her smallholding in North Wales. Ms Sheldon's 61-year-old mother, who had joined her daughter to watch the aircraft touch down in the field in Denbighshire, was forced to make a desperate dash for safety after realising the plane was out of control and headed in her direction. Wreckage: The 1930s plane clipped a tree and crash landed in the spot where the photographer's mother had been standing moments earlier . The pilot had tried to negotiate the plane through the trees when it dawned on him he was flying too fast to land safely on the sloping field. But one of the aircraft's wings clipped a branch and the unnamed man could only brace himself as the aircraft smashed to the ground on the smallholding outside Eryrys, landing in very spot where Pam Sheldon's mother Marylyn had been standing moments before. Incredibly the pilot, 47, from Oxfordshire, staggered from the wreckage of the 73-year-old Tiger Moth unharmed. Such planes were used to train pilots in the run up to and during World War Two. Prepare for landing: Amateur photographer Pam Sheldon snapped pictures of the Tiger Moth plane as it prepared to touch down on her smallholding in Denbighshire, North Wales . Incredibly, the pilot emerged from the wreckage of the vintage aircraft unscathed . Damage: The cockpit of the 1930s Tiger Moth Bi-plane is shown after the aircraft clipped a tree and crash landed in Denbighshire . Ms Sheldon - speaking out after an official report into the incident revealed the pilot acknowledged the choice of landing site was 'not a good one' - described the scene as the 'scariest moment in my entire life'. 'I was just so relieved to see that he’d managed to climb out of . the wreckage, he was as cool as a cucumber and very calm,' she said. 'Not . only that but my mum had been standing pretty much in the exact spot . just moments before - we were all very lucky. 'From where she was in the . field, she was the only one who actually saw him get out and switch the . fuel engine off. 'I have never been so happy to see a total stranger standing up looking fine in all my life,' she added. Police, fire and ambulance crews raced to the scene following the crash landing, where worked to mop up aviation fuel leaking from the damaged aircraft. 'Scariest moment of my life': Pam Sheldon told of her relief at seeing the pilot emerge from the wrecked plane . Ms Sheldon said: 'The pilot had called at my house early in the morning and asked who owned the land next door because he wanted to ask permission to land his aircraft there. 'I asked him if I could take photographs of him flying above and he took my number and told me he’d text me when he was setting off. 'As a member of a camera club, I thought it would be a great opportunity to practice my skills, and myself and about three others started taking photographs when we heard the buzz and saw him approach the field. 'He did a fly by the field first and then the second time, he flew around again a little lower. The photographer's mother Marylyn dashed to safety when she realised the vintage aircraft was going to crash . But when he went to land on his third lap, I could see he was trying to fly between two trees, which I knew was going to be tight, but he couldn’t pull upwards because of some power lines. 'All of a sudden, one of the wings clipped a tree and rolled over and crashed onto my field. 'Neighbours must’ve heard the noise because not long afterwards, I heard sirens. I just couldn’t believe it. I never want to witness anything like that ever again,' she added. Her mother Marylyn said: 'It was a really good view from where I was and I could see him going up and down circling the air and judging his landing. 'Then on the third attempt he seemed to be going in to land. 'When he came towards me I thought that he was never going to make it and he clipped his wing on one of the trees. 'I have never moved so quick in my life - the plane was coming straight towards me. 'When he crashed he must have been about three metres away from me. I was right in his view. His propellers were heading right towards me. 'The pilot was miraculously ok. despite hitting the floor with a right smash. There were bits of plane everywhere - I’d be surprised if it is fixable. 'Once he came out of the plane I went to see if he was okay and my daughter Pam was shouting for me over the other field to see if I was okay. 'I think I was still in shock because I didn’t feel that upset at that point, but it was that night that I had awful nightmares replaying it in my head again and again. 'I don’t think I will ever be going to watch a plane come to land again after that. If it hit me I don’t think I would be here today.' An official report by the Department for Transport’s Air Accident Investigation Branch revealed the unnamed pilot was attempting to land at the site for the first time. It said: 'He obtained permission from the landowner to use the field. The pilot walked it twice on the morning of the accident and was aware it was a difficult landing site approximately 200 yards long.'The field sloped steeply upwards for its first half and less steeply for the second.' The report added: 'It was evident to him any go-around decision would need to be made in good time and would require careful flying to avoid the wires and trees. The pilot was confident a safe landing could be made.' An official report following the accident revealed the unidentified pilot had been attempting to land at the site for the first time . The pilot first made a flypast and made an initial approach but this was abandoned because the aircraft was too fast. The report went on: 'On the second attempt, as the aircraft crossed the hedge, the pilot became aware the aircraft was still too fast to land safely yet too low to climb above the obstacles at the far end. 'The main wheels touched down at the top of the steeply sloping section. 'The pilot opened the throttle to maintain flying speed and fly between the trees. Concentrating on flying through the gap between the fence and the wires the aircraft’s right wing tip struck branches of a tree. 'The pilot ducked and protected his head. He was aware only of a rolling sensation until the aircraft came to a stop.' The report noted he observed the choice of landing site was 'not a good one'.","Budding photographer Pam Sheldon was snapping pictures of the vintage plane in flight after the pilot asked permission to land in her field .

But last night Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie did not put a well-shod foot wrong as they arrived for a private party at Chelsea's Crosby Hall looking catwalk ready. The young royals both chose brightly coloured dresses that fitted their figures perfectly. For Beatrice, a screen-printed mini dress that revealed toned legs. For Eugenie, a vivid coral dress with cap sleeves, a fitted waistline and a deep V-neckline, all of which served to enhance her petite hourglass figure. Stylish: Often criticised for their over-the-top fashion choices, at a party in Chelsea last night the girls looked glamorous in simple dresses with classic accessories . Tracey Emin was present at the party too, arriving in a Union flag dress, thought to be designed by Vivienne Westwood, which she paired with a pair of classic Vivienne Westwood moulded toe shoes. The party was also attended by Pippa . Middleton and her brother James, who were forced to cut short their day in the . royal box at Wimbledon in order to attend. The Middletons' early exit from the . tennis tournament meant that they missed Rafa Nadal's incredible defeat by Czech player Lukas Rosol after the game ran until almost 10pm. Colour matching: Beatrice picked out the colours of her dress with midnight blue clutch and sandals, while Eugenie accessorised hers just as the Queen herself would - with black bag and shoes . Party time: Beatrice attended the event, held in Crosby Hall in Chelsea, with her boyfriend Dave Clark . Left: Artist Tracey Emin in Union flag dress and Vivienne Westwood shoes. Right, a guest makes the most of the summery weather last night with a floaty dress split to the thigh . Spectacular venue: The party took place in Crosby Hall, a Grade II -listed property on Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. It is the only surviving part of the mansion of Crosby Hall,  built in 1466 by wool merchant John Crosby . The simple silhouettes were a savvy . choice for the girls, both of whom have very good figures, but who often fail to show them off to their best advantage. Instead of wearing figure-skimming clothes like these that enhance the body, the girls often end up in too-tight pencil skirts that appear to be stretched across their thighs, making them look bigger than they are. The warm weather was a blessing, and meant the girls left their jackets at home. Too often they wear boxy jackets that add bulk, or button up too tightly across their bodies. A touch looser is better - strained buttons or stretched fabric adds pounds that aren't there. Royal blush: Nice dresses, but both girls could have done with a touch more make up . Beatrice's . high hemline showed off great legs honed from running, while Eugenie's vintage-style tailoring showed . off the fact that the royal's waist is in fact tiny - something that is . sometimes lost when the princesses wear badly fitting clothing. The only negative? Eugenie's hair is crying out for some volume - someone give that girl some rollers. And both, but especially Eugenie, could do with more make up. A bold pink lip, some blusher, bronzer and mascara would take Eugenie, who has beautiful bone structure, from dressed-up teen to elegant princess. Her black shoes, too are a tad heavy for summer, and for the bright dress they accompany - but we'd take them over the dreadful standard-issue nude pumps the female royals can't get enough of any day.","Pippa Middleton and brother James were also present .

'Belle of the ball': April Jones pictured in the purple quilted coat she was wearing when she was snatched from the street near her home on Monday . In the purple quilted coat she was wearing when she was snatched off the street, this is five-year-old April Sue-Lyn Jones. Her disappearance has stunned the close-knit community in Machynlleth, leaving her distraught parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 43, ‘beside themselves with worry’. Yesterday, friends and relatives described her as a ‘bubbly, popular little girl’, who liked to wear party dresses and play with her friends. Just a few days ago, she attended a birthday party at a village hall with 11 other children, where she was described as the ‘belle of the ball’. Her grandmother Sue Smith last night said: ‘This is a living nightmare – it’s terrible.’ Mrs Smith, 67, who is in constant touch with her daughter, April’s mother, added: ‘April is a lovely little girl with a lovely character. We can only hope she comes back home.’ The child’s godmother Mair Raftree, 41, from Aberystwyth, broke down as she said: ‘She’s lovely. We just want her back. She’s a quiet girl, and an important member of her family. She would never go with anybody and ask for a lift. We just want her back safely.’ She added: ‘I had a phone call from Coral last night at 6.50pm. She said, “April has been kidnapped”. It was a big shock. I asked her if she’d called the police and after the shock had sunk in we drove up to Machynlleth to join the search.’ Mrs Raftree, who has known the family for eight years, said that April’s parents had only recently married and that her older sister Jasmine, 16, joined the hundreds of others who had been helping with the search. The girls’ brother Harley, ten, bravely went to school yesterday without April. Fighting back tears, primary school headteacher Gwenfair Glyn said: ‘Harley coped very well. He had his friends look after him all day. I spoke to his father as well to see how they were doing. It’s a very hard time for us all here. Our thoughts are with April’s family. ‘April’s a very bubbly and very valued member of school. She’s a very popular little girl. It’s a very difficult time. We are such a close community here in Machynlleth. ‘Most of the children know about April and what has happened, but it is hard with the little ones who don’t understand. It’s a difficult balance in telling them the truth and preserving their innocence.’ On the evening of her disappearance, April’s mother, a former Laura Ashley factory worker and her father, who does not work because of ill health, had been at a parents’ evening at her school. Yesterday, Mrs Jones remained at the family’s £165,000 home on the quiet former council estate of Bryn-y-Gog and was said to be ‘afraid to leave’ in case the police had any news as to the whereabouts of her youngest child. April was playing in front of her house, which is surrounded on three sides by tree-covered hills, at the time of her disappearance. She was with her best friend, a seven-year-old girl, who has given police vital clues in the search for her – including a description of the driver. Worry: April's disappearance has sparked concern in the local area, as well as further afield across the UK . Neighbours said April and the girl were very close. Grandmother Judy Price, 56, who lives 200 yards away, said: ‘They were always together. I would often see them playing together outside their homes. ‘April is a lovely little thing, always smiling and from a very good and caring home. ‘It makes me feel sick to think where she could be now and what is going through her mind. And everyone is feeling for her mum and dad – they must be going through hell.’ Mother-of-two Rebecca Garrod has a five-year-old daughter in the same class as April. She said: ‘My daughter and April were at the same birthday party together on Saturday. She was so happy and having such a good time. ‘I have lived here all my life and it has always been a very safe place to live, somewhere where you don’t have to worry about letting your children play outside. ‘I am being more vigilant now about my children. My little one was asking this morning whether April wasn’t coming to school because she is unwell and what will they say when they do the register.’ Family friend Phil Garrod said both of his young daughters were at the birthday party. ‘My youngest is in the same class at school. Where April lives is where all the children play together. It’s a safe environment.’ As police continued to search for April last night, a candle-lit service was held at St Peter’s Church. Priest-in-charge  Kathleen Rogers said: ‘As a community we are facing an awful time and are in a very bad  place. We need time to collect our thoughts and to place April, her family and ourselves in  God’s hands.’","Grandmother Sue Smith describes her disappearance as 'a living nightmare'

But in February 2011 she suffered a brain bleed caused by an undetected tumour. Although she battled back from the brink she was left paralysed and today, aged just nine, she is the world's youngest locked-in syndrome sufferer. This means she understands everything that is going on around her but can barely move in response. Now her parents are speaking out about her condition, following the death of fellow locked-in sufferer Tony Nicklinson, whose High Court battle sparked a public debate about assisted suicide. Hoping for the best: Stepfather Peter and mother Lee with daughter Eve, who fell ill suddenly in February 2011. Eve (left) with her younger sister in August 2010 before she suffered a brain bleed and pictured together in March this year (right) Eve's stepfather, Peter Miller, 32, . said: 'Tony's story has really helped raise awareness of it. As a family . we feel very alone and that there are not many people out there who . understand what we're going through.' Eve, who once loved Brownies and Irish dancing, can now do nothing for herself. Her parents must give her medication and feed her through a tube in her stomach several times a day. The youngster from Ashington, Northumberland, was rushed to Wansbeck Hospital after collapsing at home. The day before she had developed a rash on her neck and complained of pain behind one eye. She was transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where a scan revealed Eve had suffered a major brain bleed. Surgeons operated to relieve some of the pressure on her skull and later told her parents they hadn't expected her to survive for more than four days. But Eve did battle on and three months later she opened her eyes. However, she now couldn't move so speech therapists taught her how to communicate by blinking. Her mother Lee, 34, said: 'It was extremely emotional to realise she was trying to answer a question. It took her up to 60 seconds to blink to say yes.'

Eve, pictured with brother Jed during last Christmas (left) still has a cheeky personality since suffering locked-in syndrome (right), according to her step-father . Doctors then found the brain . tumour that had caused the bleed and in August 2011, Eve went through a . six-week course of radiotherapy. Since . then Eve has continued to improve slowly and was discharged last . November. She can now smile or grimace to express her emotions. Mr . Miller told The People: 'She can stick her tongue out if she wants a . drink and when you brush her teeth she spits the toothpaste out.' However, . he added: 'We just have to try and guess what she wants. It is more . emotion that we get from her and we have learned to read her facial . expressions.' He said Eve still had a cheeky personality, smiling whenever her younger siblings Jed, 3, and Mia, 7, are naughty. Eve swimming last year. She undergoes multiple therapies to help strengthen her limbs . Eve loved Brownies and Irish dancing before she fell ill . Tony Nicklinson, suffered a massive stroke in 2005, which left him with locked-in syndrome. He wanted to have an assisted-suicide in the UK . Although her parents hold on to the . hope that she will one day get better they know there is no guarantee . that this will happen. They have adapted their home to give it . wheelchair access and Eve receives physiotherapy and speech and language . therapy amongst other treatments. She is signed up to go to a new primary school for children with special needs. Lee . and Peter are now busy raising £25,000 to pay for sensory equipment and . hydrotherapy sessions to improve Eve's quality of life. 'At present, Eve has a poor quality of life and however hard we try, it . never seems like she has much to look forward to on a day to day basis,' they wrote on their JustGiving charity page. 'Any kind of help to be able to buy Eve something to make her life worth living would mean the world to us.' Some locked-in sufferers have improved over time. Martin Pistorious from South Africa, developed the condition following a mystery illness. However,  he started to improve in his teens and communicated via a computer. Now 37, he now has the strength to push a vacuum cleaner and is married and living in Harlow, Essex. Locked-in syndrome victim, Tony Nicklinson, passed away aged 58 last week after refusing any more food. He had been unable to move since suffering a stroke seven years ago. He had described his life as 'intolerable' and recently lost a court battle to allow doctors to end his life without facing punishment. While Lee and Peter hope Eve will never ask for assisted suicide they believe Mr Nicklinson should have been allowed to have his life ended. Mr Miller said, referring to Eve: 'For now we still hold on to hope she will get better.'

A former St John Ambulance volunteer who sexually assaulted four young girls has been sentenced to 17 years in jail. Anthony Bint, 51, from Derby, was found guilty of 16 charges, including an attempted rape, that took place between 1978 and 2011. He joined the first-aid organisation during this period. Sentencing Bint on Friday, Judge John Burgess, Recorder of Derby, said the crimes were the type that 'ruined people’s lives'. 'Evil monster': Supporters of Anthony Bint, in the red coat, gesture outside Derby Crown Court . Bint subjected his victims, who described the attacks as 'harrowing' and 'devastating', to a seven-day trial after he denied all charges. His victims released a joint statement following the sentencing at Derby Crown Court. It said: 'Fifteen months have passed since the first revelations of abuse by this evil monster. 'It was a massive relief for the victims and their families to finally see justice done. 'It has been without doubt the most traumatic time we have ever faced and has deeply affected all concerned. 'We are obviously very concerned about the possible long-term effects on all the victims. 'We can only hope that with the right counselling the mental scars will heal as time passes.' Depraved: Bint was found guilty of 16 charges, including attempted rape, and sentenced to 17 years . The victims thanked the police for their 'painstaking efforts' and 'caring support' They also thanked Judge Burgess 'for his wisdom and also for his sensitivity when addressing the victims'. Bint’s crimes only came to light in June last year when one of his victims told her mother about the abuse. Following this, three other victims also reported being abused. Bint will serve at least half his sentence in prison and the rest on licence. He will also be banned from any unsupervised contact with children, will be placed on the sex offenders register for life and will be banned from working with children. Judge Burgess said: 'I have made these orders in order to prevent any sexual offences against children in the future.' After passing sentence Judge Burgess added: 'I thank the members of the public who behaved with dignity. 'I hope the sentence I pass down today provides some comfort and allows the victims to move on as that is the most important thing.' Detective Constable Vandome said: 'It has been a very long and complex investigation. 'It has only been possible as a result of the bravery of those that have come forward and told their stories. Without them, Bint may still be committing these offences. 'I am pleased with the sentence that has been passed today, not only because it reflects the hard work and dedication of the officers involved in the investigation but more importantly because the victims have seen justice done.' A spokesperson for the St John Ambulance said: 'Mr Bint resigned as a volunteer member of St John Ambulance. 'He has had no access to the organisation or its membership activities since.'","Anthony Bint, 51, found guilty of 16 charges including an attempted rape .

He threatened to post a sex video they had recorded together on a social networking website, Cupar Sheriff Court in Fife heard. Fined: Paul Culbert, pictured leaving Cupar Sheriff Court in Fife today, sent a series of text messages to try and blackmail a 17-year-old girl into rekindling their nine-month relationship . Prosecutor Joanne Smith told the court: 'The . complainer decided to end the relationship and on telling Culbert of . her decision she started to receive numerous calls and texts to her . phone. 'The text messages . were an attempt to blackmail her into reconciling their relationship, or . the video would be uploaded onto a social networking site.' The girl did not return any of Culbert's texts or phone calls, which were made between July 7 and 9 this year, and contacted police. Culbert, from Leven, Fife, was arrested and his laptop and mobile phone seized. He pleaded guilty to sending text messages . that were grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing . character, making offensive comments, and threatening to distribute a . video of a sexual nature. The court heard that Culbert accepted that he may have sent texts which 'were a bit over the top'.

Just one year ago we would never have imagined that a mainstream publishing company like HarperCollins would dream of releasing a guide to bondage bedroom play - or BDSM, as it is known to the initiated. BDSM is a catch-all abbreviation that brings together the predilections for bondage and discipline (B/D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism or sadism and masochism. While it is a lifestyle choice enjoyed, sometimes to extremes, by people across the globe, it is fair to say that the current popularity of BDSM refers to a sort of 'BDSM lite' - a tamer, more approachable version of the sexual proclivity. And that is just what is portrayed in HarperCollins' new guide. The book, Fifty Ways To Play - which carries the subtitle BDSM for nice people. The publisher bills the book, by husband and wife duo Debra and Don Macleod as A Beginner's Guide To Unleashing Your Erotic Desires - and it is enough to have the more buttoned-up readers blushing into their blindfolds. Fifty Ways To Play claims to offer 50 'edgy and erotic' adventures which the publisher says are 'perfect for the millions of readers who have been inspired by the phenomenal Fifty Shades trilogy.' 'Fifty Shades has broken down the taboos about BDSM and more women than ever are wanting to spice up their sex lives,' HarperCollins said. 'But there is very little out there that shows you how to turn every night into an erotic fantasy. 'From turning your bedroom into a 'Red Room Of Desire [in the book it is known as the Red Room Of Pain] to exploring the fine art of Japanese rope bondage, these 50 edgy and erotic adventures make incredible sex incredibly easy,' they say. Conveniently for the budding BDSM-er, the book is being packaged up and sold as part of erotic gift sets by boxofgrey.com, a website set up for newcomers to the BDSM world. Fifty Ways To Play is being sold as part of luxury BDSM packages on website boxofgrey.com . They have created gift boxes with a selection of props to complement the book, with two different sets on offer to assist the BDSM virgins: the Play Box, which includes a blindfold, paddle, kegel balls and a rope kit, and the Summer Holiday box, which contains a holiday-friendly selection of products that the site says are discreet enough that they can be packed in hand luggage without arousing suspicions during security checks.","HarperCollins capitalising on current zeitgeist for sexual experimentation sparked by Fifty Shades phenomenon .

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 2 January 2012 . A little girl who has spent her entire life crippled by cerebral palsy has  taken her first steps. Since undergoing pioneering surgery in the U.S. Lily Gordon, six, has even managed a few dance steps with the help of a walking frame. Her proud mother, 39-year-old Joanne, of North Shields, North Tyneside, said: 'She is doing so well. She has even joined a musical theatre class and joins in doing little movements with her feet.' Delight: Lily Gordon is now walking after having surgery at the Childrenís Hospital in St Louis, Missouri . This time last year seeing Lily take part in a dance class was something her parents Joanne and David never thought they would see.  But then they watched a programme which would go on to change Lily's life. They heard about the story of a young boy with cerebral palsy who had travelled to America for pioneering Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery to help him walk. As a result Joanne, a finance and commercial manager, decided the family would raise the £50,000 necessary to send Lily to The Children's Hospital, St Louis, in Missouri, USA. It was hoped a four-week stay would make Lily's dreams of walking a reality. Joanne said: 'It was just by the off-chance we had seen the programme, and if we had not heard about it we may never have gone along that road. 'Last year we were just thinking about it around Christmas, we did not know how much it would cost. 'It hard to believe it is 12 months later and it is all over and on her way to recovery. We are so glad we did it.' Joanne with her daughter Lily who had Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery . Months of hard work and endless fundraising finally paid off for the Gordon family and they managed to raise £70,000 by the summer. On August 12, Lily's sixth birthday, Joanne, David, Lily and their oldest daughter Katie, jetted off to America for the long-awaited surgery. Now Lily is home and going through rigorous physiotherapy three times a week after enduring a four- hour operation and then further tendon lengthening surgery in America. Joanne added: 'It is all the little things that mean the world to us such as Lily's handwriting improving since the surgery. 'Some people may expect her to be walking fully by now, but it is things like her sitting on the sofa on her own and the fact we can leave her to sit on a chair whereas before she would have just fallen off it. 'We can see as the weeks go on she is getting stronger. She wants to walk now, and she can if we hold her hand.' According to Scope, it is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. The family have turned their dining room into a mini gym for Lily to build up her strength after the tightness was taken from her muscles. Lily has gone from having large splints the whole way up her leg, to small ankle splints which her parents hope she will be able to remove in the new year. Joanne said: 'Hopefully in the new year we will get her just on her walker - a stable frame which gives her support. 'But the one thing Lily loves about her new splints is that she can now wear sparkly Princess shoes which she could never get her feet into before. 'She has a pair of red sparkly shoes from Next and she just loves them because everyone says she is like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. 'She has worked very hard but we have a long way to go but it has been a very good year.'","Lily started with splints the whole way up her leg but now has small ankle splints .

Joanne Armstrong opted for flat shoes during her court appearance after admitting using her stiletto heels during an attack . A pregnant teaching assistant battered a man with her stiletto heel during a late night gang attack on the stranger outside a bar. Joanne Armstrong, aged 28, avoided jail after admitting repeatedly hitting Sean Kelly in the face with her shoe as he lay helpless on the pavement. The mother-of-two, who didn’t realise she was pregnant with her second child at the time of the attack, was described as ‘having gone mental’ as she led the assault on the clubber barefoot and shrieking at the top of her voice. Judge Michael Henshell, who sentenced Armstrong to an eight-month suspended jail sentence, labelled her behaviour as a ‘typical scene’ in Manchester witnessed every night of the week. Armstrong has since been sacked from her job at St Chrysostom’s Primary School in Manchester. The court heard she ‘wound up’ four or five unidentified thugs who followed the victim, knocked him to the ground and savagely kicked and stamped on him outside Baa Bar on Wilmslow Road, Fallowfield. Armstrong appeared to be the ‘instigator’ of the 2.30am attack in April last year, witnesses said, even though she didn’t know Mr Kelly. In the aftermath, the 26-year-old victim was rushed by ambulance to hospital and treated for a fractured jaw. Armstrong, of Longsight, originally denied any involvement in the attack, but blood on her spiked heel exposed her lies and she was charged with grievous bodily harm. She admitted the charge a few weeks before her trial was due to start. Nicola . Hall, defending, told the court that Armstrong, who had never been in . trouble before, was the ‘primary carer’ for her two young children. The . court heard that at the time of the attack Armstrong was in a . ‘heightened emotional state’ - ‘reeling’ from the recent death of a . friend and an argument with her boyfriend.

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 11:50 EST, 27 January 2012 . The U.S. economy grew last year at its worst rate since the recession, despite ending on a high. The 1.7 per cent annual growth figure was roughly half the progression made in 2010 - although the economy did move at a promising annual rate in the final three months of 2011 at 2.8 per cent. Americans spent more on vehicles and firms restocked shelves at the strongest pace in nearly two years, but growth was restrained by the biggest annual government spending cuts in four decades. At work: Assembly line worker Edward Houie moves a door into position for a 2012 Chevrolet Volt at a plant in Michigan. The U.S. economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the final three months of last year . ‘We're still repairing the damage done by the financial crisis,’ Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said today. ‘On top of that we face a more challenging world. We have a lot of challenges ahead.’ Businesses are expected to ease up on restocking in the first three months of 2012, which should slow first-quarter growth - and consumers may cut back spending if wages continue to lag inflation. In the final three months of last year, consumer spending grew at a 2 per cent annual rate and income grew modestly at 0.8 per cent, which were both up on the third quarter. Consumer spending makes up 70 per cent of economic activity. Much of the growth was powered by a 14.8 per cent surge in sales of vehicles and other long-lasting manufactured goods. Still rising: The 1.7 per cent annual growth figure was roughly half the progression made in 2010 - although the economy did move at a promising annual rate in the final three months of 2011 of 2.8 per cent . Business restocking, which can vary widely during the year, was the greatest contributor to growth in the last quarter of 2011. It added nearly 2 percentage points to the gross domestic product (GDP). 'We're still repairing the damage done by the financial crisis. On top of that we face a more challenging world. We have a lot of challenges ahead' Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner . Government spending at all levels fell at a 4.6 per cent annual rate in the fourth quarter and 2.1 per cent for the year - the biggest drop since 1971. Federal defence cuts were a major factor. The economy is measured by GDP, which covers everything from haircuts to hotel bookings to jet fighter planes. The estimated figure on Friday was the first of three for the fourth quarter. Growth is likely to slow in the first three months of this year to below 2 per cent - largely because business restocking will slow, Capital Economics economist Paul Ashworth warned. Shopping: A worker walks through the 'Action Alley' at a new Wal-Mart store in Chicago, Illinois. Businesses are expected to ease up on restocking in the first three months of 2012 . ‘Overall, the pickup in growth doesn't look half as good when you realise that most of it was due to inventory accumulation,’ he said. But not everyone thinks the first quarter of 2012 will be weak. 'Overall, the pickup in growth doesn't look half as good when you realise that most of it was due to inventory accumulation' Paul Ashworth, Capital Economics . Business investment in capital goods should be stronger, consumer spending firmer and government activity less of a drag, said High Frequency Economics analyst Ian Shepherdson. Other data show the economy ended 2011 on a strong note. Firms invested more in equipment and machinery in December. People are buying more cars and consumer confidence is rising. Unemployment fell to 8.5 per cent last month - the lowest level in nearly three years - after the sixth straight month of solid hiring. Even the depressed housing market has shown some improvement. But many economists fear that a recession in Europe could dampen demand for U.S. manufactured goods and slow growth. Without more jobs and better pay, consumer spending is likely to stagnate. Warning: U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, saying that the country is 'still repairing the damage done by the financial crisis' Any solutions? President Barack Obama speaks today at The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan . The Federal Reserve signalled this week that a full recovery could take at least three more years and it will therefore probably not increase its benchmark interest rate until late 2014 at the earliest. 'The Fed is attempting to shield the . economy from a potentially more severe recession in Europe' Ryan . Sweet, Moody's Analytics . That was a year and a half later than it had said earlier. The central bank also reduced its outlook for growth this year, from as much as 2.9 per cent forecast in November down to 2.7 per cent. The Fed also sees unemployment falling as low as 8.2 per cent this year. U.S. stocks fell after the Commerce Department data came out, with the Dow Jones dropping 0.29 per cent this morning. ‘The Fed is attempting to shield the economy from a potentially more severe recession in Europe,’ said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ‘Even though the economy improved last quarter there are a number of headwinds and a lot of uncertainty surrounding Europe, emerging markets and also U.S. fiscal policy.’","U.S. economy grew 1.7% in 2011; but up 2.8% annual rate in 2011 Q4 .

Dozing air passengers face the prospect of being rudely awakened by someone talking loudly on their mobile phone after Virgin Atlantic became the first British airline to permit calls on board flights. While the news may be warmly welcomed by businessmen and others for whom it is important to keep connected at all times, anti-noise campaigners claim the decision is 'crazy'. Passengers flying between London and New York on Virgin's new A330 Airbus will be able to not only make calls, but also to send and receive text messages, emails and have web access via GPRS. Taking off? Passengers flying between London and New York on Virgin's new A330 airbus will be able to not only make calls, but also to send and receive text messages, emails and have web access via GPRS . Business class passengers will be able to enjoy the longest beds in the modern cabins . The facility will be offered throughout the cabin and there will be no restrictions on when the facility can be used - although Virgin say that at the moment limited bandwidth means only ten people can make calls simultaneously. The service is not permitted during . take-off or landing, and American laws mean that it has to be turned off . around 250 miles from US airspace. Val Weedon of the anti-noise action group Noisedirect said the organisation receives a steady stream of complaints from people annoyed by mobile phone users on trains and coaches and was against the decision to expand permitted usage to aeroplane flights. She said: 'Noise is noise and the . impact is no different in any situation. Noise is a trigger for stress. The heart rate increases and it can cause to all sorts of health . problems. There have been lots of studies finding links between noise . and stress. 'In such a confined space as an . aircraft it could be very annoying. While we are not totally against it . in principle, during certain parts of the trip, such as overnight when . people want to rest, it should definitely not be allowed.'

Virgin Atlantic said the system was aimed at business travelers needing to make an urgent call to the office or for people wanting to get a message home. Steve Griffiths, Chief Operating Officer . at Virgin Atlantic said: 'Many people . will have experienced that moment when you’re about to take off on a . 10-hour flight and you need to send an important message to the office, . or even reminding a family member to feed the cat! 'It’s also quite . fun to call home and say 'Guess where I am' – not many people would . think you’re travelling at 35,000ft above the Atlantic Ocean.' The system works using a small telecommunications base station called a piccell. A picocell is low cost and typically the size of a ream of A4 paper. It acts as a miniature mobile telephone tower communicating with mobile phones within the aircraft and relaying the signals to either satellites or a land-based system. Communication between the picocell and the rest of the telephone network is on separate frequencies. There is no interference with the aircraft's equipment as is the case with on–board phone systems already on many commercial aircraft. Interference is reduced because both the picocell's and the phones' output power can be reduced to very low levels. It will also feature on the airline’s . Boeing 747 planes, which are currently going through a £50 million . refurbishment. By the end of 2012, nearly 20 aircraft will provide the . service. The announcement comes as Virgin .

Class cabin with a ‘technology hub’ to connect a smart phone, USB or . tablet device. AeroMobile, which is part-owned by Panasonic are partners with Virgin Atlantic on the project. Passengers will be billed for the international roaming charges and the service is currently offered to customers with 02 or Vodafone networks. The system offers the equivalent of . having a telecomms base station on the aircraft - called picocell.  It's . new British designed technology that doesn't interfere with the . avionics .

The remains of two Spitfires that were used for peacetime target practice by the RAF have been discovered on the same firing range nearly 60 years later. In 1954, the surplus planes were dumped in the middle of the vast Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire for trainee pilots to strafe to hone their firing skills. The wrecks, which are still worth tens of thousands of pounds in their current state, were left in the remote spot and over the years became covered in long grass and weeds.

The machines remain in situ in the secret location on the plain - which is about the size of the Isle of Wight . But plans are now in place to salvage what is left of the aircraft after historian Mark Khan recently stumbled upon them during conservation work in the area. The fate of the two planes seems quite incredible now given the legendary status attached to the Spitfire. Fully restored versions of them are worth about £2million today. Mr Khan looked through the MoD archives to identify these two as PK518 and PK519, two Mark 22 Spitfires made in 1946. The fate of the two planes seems quite incredible now given the legendary status attached to the Spitfire . The machines remain in situ in the secret location on the plain - which is about the size of the Isle of Wight. It is understood the Royal Air Force Museum plans to recover them in the near future. Mr Khan, 51, said: 'A colleague and I really just stumbled upon one of them by accident up a small hill. 'I realised very quickly from the shape of it that it was the remnants of an aircraft. The wing clearly featured bays for guns. 'But it wasn’t until I got home and looked at comparison photographs that I identified it as a Spitfire.' Mr Khan checked the national archives which revealed that it was one of two given to the School of Land Air Warfare at Old Sarum, near Salisbury, for target practice in 1954. Mr Khan returned to the scene and found the wreckage of the second Spitfire 200 yards away from the first. He said: 'I couldn’t believe that after all these years these two Spitfires that had lain untouched and unseen for so long had been found.' The PK518 and PK519 aircraft would have been hit by the 30mm Aden cannon fitted to Hawker Hunters . Some 21,000 Spitfires were built during and after the Second World War, although most were sold off for scrap in the early 1950s due to a shortage of metal. The emergence of the jet engine also hastened the demise of the propeller-powered aircraft. Mr Khan, from Arundel, West Sussex, said: 'Spitfires were written off in the 1950s but there was a requirement for them to be used for training, like these two. 'On June 1, 1954 both aircraft were dispatched to Old Sarum. 'PK518 and PK519 were erected as targets on the ranges at Salisbury Plain. 'They would have been hit by the 30mm Aden cannon fitted to Hawker Hunters. Some 21,000 Spitfires were built during and after the Second World War. Above, RAF fighter pilots run to their Spitfires during an alert in 1940 . 'I can only assume that the military chiefs thought they had been blown to pieces and left them there. 'The area is so remote that it has been seldom visited over the years and their whereabouts became forgotten.' Mr Khan believes the wreckage is still valuable today. He said: 'Spitfires that crashed in World War Two and were buried 20ft in the ground are still flying today after being salvaged. 'It depends on what parts are left but collectively they could be worth tens of thousands of pounds.' Spitfire pilot and expert Matt Jones, who runs the UK’s only Spitfire flying school, said hardly anybody was interested in them after the war. He said: 'They were no longer needed and the military didn’t know what to do with them. 'Some were sold for scrap and some just buried in the ground. 'It wasn’t until about 20 or 30 years ago that there was a big revival of interest in them. 'Because they are so scarce, if you found one buried in a crater in a semi-preserved state and it came out still looking like a Spitfire, it could be worth £500,000.'","Remnants worth tens of thousands of pounds - and up to £2m fully restored .

For more than 40 years, Jeffrey MacDonald has never wavered from his claim that intruders killed his pregnant wife and two daughters. On Monday, the former Green Beret doctor came to federal court with new evidence he hopes will clear his name. The evidence involves DNA from hair fibers found in the family's apartment at Fort Bragg, North Carolina and a statement from a deputy U.S. marshal. Developments: Jeffrey MacDonald in 1970 (left) after being charged with his wife and two daughters' murders. He has always proclaimed his innocence and is back in court on new DNA evidence, aged 68 (right) The marshal said a woman told him she was in the apartment in the early morning hours of February 17, 1970, when Colette, Kimberly and Kristen MacDonald were stabbed and beaten to death. MacDonald, 68, has always maintained that he awoke on a sofa in the home as three men attacked his family and a woman, wearing a blonde wig and a floppy hat, chanted 'acid is groovy, kill the pigs'. Testimony on Monday focused on the statement from Marshal Jimmy Britt and on Helena Stoeckley -  a drug addict and troubled woman who repeatedly said outside of court that she was in the MacDonald home. She testified in court however that she didn't remember where she was that night. MacDonald's attorneys said jurors wouldn't have found him guilty in 1979 if they could have considered the marshal's statement. DNA evidence also shows three hairs found in the home on the night of the killings did not belonging to any family member. Support: Kathryn MacDonald (left) who married the convicted murderer in 2002 leaves the hearing in Wilmington today and MacDonald's attorney Wade Smith (right) Those who believe MacDonald committed . the killings have said the hairs could have come from anyone - . neighbors or other people who had been in the home. Wade . Smith, one of MacDonald's trial attorneys, testified on Monday that Mr Britt came to him in 2005 to say Miss Stoeckley told him she was in the . apartment when the MacDonalds were killed. Britt . also said he heard the prosecutor, Jim Blackburn, tell Stoeckley that . he would charge her in the case if she testified to that on the stand. Britt, . who has since died, came forward because 'he wanted to unload his heart . and his soul,' Smith testified. Stoeckley is also dead. Blackburn, . who later went into private practice, was disbarred and served a prison . sentence for ethical violations. He is expected to be called as a . witness. Mr Smith also . said a day before the trial that Stoeckley never said anything in his . presence that helped prove MacDonald's innocence. A lifetime in prison: MacDonald, right, appears in federal court in Wilmington, N.C. where he was convicted of killing his wife and two daughters at the family home . Happy couple: Jeffrey MacDonald, right, and his wife Colette in Fort Bragg, N.C. MacDonald's pregnant wife and two young daughters were murdered in 1970, and MacDonald was convicted of the crimes . 'I was absolutely devoted to the case and upheld my role as counsel,' Smith said. 'I'm still devoted to the case. But I did not hear Helena Stoeckley say useful things for us.' Smith said it was possible Stoeckley said something outside his presence. MacDonald's lead attorney at the time, Bernard Segal, had indicated to the trial judge that Stoeckley made several statements to the defense that were helpful, including that she remembered standing at the end of the couch where MacDonald was sleeping. But she did not say that on the stand, and Smith said he didn't hear her say that. Smith testified for most of Monday as prosecutors questioned him about inaccuracies in Britt's five statements. He said at various times that he picked up Stoeckley in Greenville, S.C., or Charleston, S.C., and that he dropped Stoeckley off at a hotel when she was in custody. He later said he took her to the jail. Britt's ex-wife, Mary, was the last witness of the day. She talked about how excited Britt was when he came home from picking up Stoeckley and how upset he was when MacDonald was found guilty. Stoeckley, he told her, described the MacDonalds' apartment 'to a T,' she said. After the verdict, his supervisor asked him to lock up MacDonald, he said. 'I told him I was not doing any more of the dirty work,' her husband told her. Instead, he left work early. The murders came six months after the Manson Family slayings in California, feeding into fears that Manson-type killers were on the loose in North Carolina. The word 'pig' was written in blood on a headboard at the MacDonald home; the same was on the door of pregnant Manson victim Sharon Tate's house in Los Angeles. The crime became the basis of Joe McGinniss' best-selling book Fatal Vision and a made-for-TV drama. MacDonald's wife, Kathryn, was in the courtroom, as is Colette MacDonald's brother, Bob Stevenson.","Jeffrey MacDonald has maintained his innocence for 40 years over murders at Fort Bragg, North Carolina ."

A husband whose wife has just died of meningitis now faces an agonising wait to discover whether he too has contracted the disease. George Cary, 65, was told that Lilian, his wife of 35 years, had contracted meningitis from tainted steroid injections intended to treat her back pain. And Mr Cary's own back injections may have come from a contaminated batch too - meaning that when he laid his wife to rest today he still did not know if he too was suffering from the deadly illness. Scroll down for video . Grief: After the death of Lilian Cary, left, her husband George, right, fears he could have contracted meningitis . Victim: Mrs Cary, who was born in Britain, died in Michigan last month at the age of 67 . British-born Mrs Cary is one of 11 people across the U.S. to have died of fungal meningitis contracted from medication mixed by a pharmacy in Massachusetts. Her husband went to an emergency room last weekend for a spinal tap, but the test results had not arrived by the time of Lilian's memorial service in Howell, Michigan on Tuesday. 'They advised me to watch for symptoms,' Mr Cary said. 'At this point, there's nothing abnormal, but they said the same thing when Lilian had hers. 'Not only have I lost my wife, but I'm watching the clock to see if anything develops.' Devastated: Mr Cary pays tribute to his wife of 35 years alongside his daughters Heather and Jill . Memorial: Mrs Cary is the 11th victim of fungal meningitis contracted by tainted steroid injections . Michigan has at least 21 cases of meningitis related to steroid shots made by the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, Massachusetts. In the country as a whole, 119 cases of the illness have so far been linked to the injections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meningitis is an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, and a back injection would put any contaminant in more direct contact with that lining. Mrs Cary died on September 30, aged 67. She had been ill since late August, but it was not diagnosed as meningitis until September 22. Nonetheless, her health seemed to be improving at University of Michigan hospital. Culprit: Steroids from the New England Compounding Center are responsible for over 100 cases . 'She was responding to medication. Her spirits were up. Her fever was broken,' Mr Cary said. 'She was walking the hallway and Skyping with grandsons.' But she became unresponsive on September 26, and was eventually removed from life support after suffering a stroke. Mr Cary said he was informed on Saturday that his wife had been treated with tainted steroids for back pain. The doctor at Michigan Pain Specialists said Mr Cary also was at risk. 'The whole staff is devastated,' said Mr Cary. 'The people there are professionals. I have the greatest respect for their care. They truly care about the people they treat. They're suffering just as much as I am.' Mrs Cary was a native of Stoke-on-Trent in England who emigrated to the U.S. in 1965 to work as a nanny. The Carys met in Mount Kisco, New York, and were married in 1977. They moved to Michigan in 2000 after many years in the St Louis area and have lived in Howell since 2003.",Disease caused by back injections has now claimed 11 victims across U.S.
"By . Mail Today Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:12 EST, 19 January 2012 . Conman: Police sources say Bunty (pictured) might have feigned mental illness to avoid arrest . Devinder Singh aka Bunty Chor, the maverick conman arrested in Bhopal last week, was brought on transit remand to Delhi on Wednesday afternoon and sent to two days police custody by a local court. Bunty was brought back to the Capital on transit remand after the Delhi Police confirmed his involvement in a carjacking incident in New Friends Colony of south-east Delhi. A salesman at a jeweller’s shop in Haryana had identified Bunty earlier this month, where he had gone to purchase silver jewellery after stealing the car from NFC. However, he gave the slip to the Haryana Police as well and managed to reach Bhopal. 'He has been identified and we are questioning him about the carjacking incident as well,' additional commissioner of police (southeast) Ajay Choudhury said. Sources in the Delhi Police said Bunty might have feigned mental illness— he claimed to be an incarnation of Jesus Christ— to avoid being arrested, but he was 'really upset after his family members, including his girlfriend, disowned him and did not come to his help to start a normal life'. Bunty was arrested by the Delhi Police in 2007 for a spate of robberies in south Delhi. After his release in 2008, he had vowed to lead a normal life. But sources said Bunty had reverted to his old ways for the past two months now. 'His last five cases of theft and carjacking were not professionally planned. He probably took to crime again as his dear ones didn’t help him start a new life. Had he been his former self, it would have been impossible to arrest him,' said a Delhi police official who has interrogated Bunty on several occasions. Bunty has reportedly been involved in over 500 theft cases and managed to dodge the police on a number of occasions. Though Bunty was not choosy about what he stole, he had a weakness for luxury cars and fancy watches. He was arrested on January 14 in Bhopal, following a tip-off that a man resembling the infamous Bunty Chor was roaming in the old city area. Initially, he tried to fool the police by saying his name was Napolean Jesus and that he came to Bhopal from Hong Kong. He later claimed he belonged to Nepal.",Devinder Singh brought back to Delhi following arrest in Bhopal .

Close bond: Actress Charlize Theron with her mother Gerda. In 1991, the Oscar-winning actress watched as her mother killed her father after he pulled a gun on the pair after returning home drunk . She was not prosecuted as authorities ruled she had pulled shot him four times in self-defence. A police spokeswoman said the victim had been suffocated with a plastic bag after being forced  forced into a bathroom where he was tied up. Marks on his body indicate he may have been burned with cigarettes and a clothes iron. Family trauma: Charlize with her parents Charles and Gerda . The five robbers gained access to the property by pretending to be interested in buying a used car for sale by Newman’s girlfriend, reported South African newspaper Independent News. The robbers also tied up the gardener and a domestic worker and forced them into another room. For years Charlize refused to talk about the incident, which occurred when she was 15, only saying that her mother was a victim of domestic violence. But in 2004, the 36-year-old gave her first television interview about the killing to ABC News, saying she was in her bedroom when her father and an uncle came home and an aunt had called the house to warn that her father was agitated. Childhood: A young Charlize makes friends with a chimpanzee and right Charlize enjoys a day at the beach with her father Charles . 'Nature gives you instinct. And I knew something bad was going to happen,' Theron said . In her account of the shooting, the young Charlize told detectives she heard her father swearing and shouting at her mother to let him into the house. Her statement reads: 'My father said he would kill us with his shotgun. My mom said she was afraid that he really would kill us. 'The next moment I heard a number of shots being fired. I don't know how many, and then I heard my mom screaming hysterically. 'When I went into the passage, I saw my father's brother, Danie Theron.

'My mother was sitting in a corner of the bedroom crying and she said, 'Charlize, I've shot them. I've shot them.' I can only state that my mother had not had any alcohol at any stage. She was sober.' Gerda told police her drunk and aggressive husband had threatened to shoot her and Charlize. 'I simply started firing at him. I don't know how many times. I saw him fall. When I turned around I saw his brother behind me and instinctively I fired another shot in his direction. His brother fell down.' It was the ambitious Gerda who pushed . her beautiful daughter into modelling, setting her on the road to . Hollywood. They remain very close. She and Charlize also talk in Afrikaans which they speak to each other and Charlize said her mother is her hero who helped her deal with the tragedy. Award-winning: Charlize Theron won a Best Actress Oscar in 2004 for her role in the film Monster, as a prostitute who became a serial killer . Speaking to Piers Morgan last year, she said: 'It was the great tragedy of my life, I think what follows is you have to find where you want yourself to be, and how you want people to see you in this world, I had a parent who led me through the grief, shock and anger. 'She guided me to towards not being a victim, it doesn't haunt me, I am completely at peace.' In 2008, Charlize's aunt Elsa Malan insisted her 'mildmannered' brother would never have attacked his wife or adored daughter. She made the claims in a book, Killer Women: Fatal South African Females by South African crime writer Chris Karsten. Charlize, 31, whose latest movie was Snow White and the Huntsman, was said to be furious that members of her father's family had broken years of silence to talk about the killing. The book also revealed how Charlize's police statement 'went missing' soon after she won a Best Actress Oscar in 2004 for her role in the film Monster, as a prostitute who became a serial killer. It has resurfaced after investigations by Karsten. 'We want to set the record straight. All those perceptions that Charles was some kind of a monster-at home were very hurtful to our family and everyone who knew him. He was a dedicated family man. His wife and daughter were the most important things in his life.' She recalls a 'benign and mild-mannered man' who 'could never lift his hand in anger to anyone. Gerda, on the other hand, was more of an introvert. 'She could be testy and grumpy and never hesitated to speak her mind. 'Charles always knew when he overstepped the mark with her and then he would meekly try to patch things up. 'As for his so-called alcoholism, we all know that he loved his drink but I never saw him drunk.'","Owner Barry Newland was tortured to death at the house in Benoni, near Johannesburg, last Friday by a gang of five burglars .

Now, digital innovations like cloud technology and have given . retailers cheaper, faster and easier ways to use their store's security . footage to interpret consumer patterns that go unnoticed on the shop . floor. 'A mobile security video lets me stand above the action, and read the crowd no matter where I am' Prism Skylabs uses security footage to create stop-motion time studies and heat maps to show customer movements, and which items customers touch or pick-up most through the day with a red, . green or blue marker showing the most popular merchandise. The Famous Footwear chain also uses security footage to help managers place promotions in the optimal spot. Jon Grander, vice president of asset and revenue management at the . Brown Shoe Co., which owns Famous Footwear, said: 'We were posting so many ads in our . stores they were like wallpaper and became meaningless. Big brother? Prism Skylabs software collects security camera data to reveal where and how people linger, which products are most popular, and the aisles people browse in the most and for how long . 'Now . we can put the ads where we have people’s undivided attention, such as . the seating area where they try on shoes. Little changes make a big . difference.' According to research and surveillance specialists, Walmart has employed an internal team to test new ways of using security footage to enhance in-store marketing. Prism Skylabs CEO and . co-founder, Steve Russell, said: 'This kind of information helps managers . make micro-merchandising decisions such as, ""will it increase sales if I . put out the yellow sweaters or the blue sweaters?""' The Creamery, a San Francisco cafe, knows the benefits of fusing security footage with marketing analytics firsthand. 'This information helps managers . make decisions such as, ""will it increase sales if I . put the yellow sweaters here?""' Owner Ivor Bradley said he uses his smartphone to watch streaming footage via the The Creamery's security cameras. He explained: 'The mobile video lets me stand above the action. It lets me read the crowd no matter where I am.' He added that recently, while keeping . an eye on the store's cameras during breakfast rush hour, he noticed . that people would often attempt to lean across the counter display, and . cut off other customers, to pick up a cup of fresh orange juice. He . said his busy staff didn’t notice, yet it was so clear on his . smartphone monitor. 'The camera saw what I didn’t,' Mr Bradley said. 'Sales of the fresh OJ shot up 100 percent,' after he moved the juice . closer to the counter. Secret tools: According to research and surveillance specialists, Walmart has employed an internal team to test new ways of using security footage to enhance in-store marketing . Reaping rewards: The Creamery and Famous Footwear knows the benefits of fusing security footage with marketing analytics firsthand . 'Plus the line moved noticeably faster,' he added. American Apparel also saved 40per cent in fixed expenses by using . RetailNext, a system that aggregates surveillance data for marketing purposes, according to Stacey Shulman, chief information officer. She said: 'Our . technological changes, including [improved] traffic counting, have . collectively impacted our sales, theft and labor costs.' While a store's surveillance-turned-marketing footage is not used to identify specific shoppers (Prism hides customers’ identities by blurring their faces or only using their heat paths), it seems retailers want to keep this growing crossover camera practice quiet. Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum, said that while online shoppers are aware their purchasing habits will be tracked on the Internet, people have an expectation of privacy in brick-and-mortar stores. Ms Dixon added: 'It is crucial for retailers to disclose that camera-tracking information is being used for marketing and to offer shoppers a way to opt out. It’s especially important in the case of children and in sensitive areas of stores such as pharmacies.' Time.com polled more than 500 readers in September on their feelings towards these crossover camera practices, and 62per cent admitted they thought it was 'creepy'. A large 40per cent of people said they would avoid retailers that did so, if they were made aware.","American Apparel, Famous Footwear and Walmart use security cameras to study shoppers’ movements in order to get them to spend more in store ."

Mother: Susan Christine Warner, 40, has been charged with three counts of neglect after leaving her 3 and 10-year-old daughters alone with her bedridden great-grandmother . Two sisters and their bedridden great-grandmother were removed from what police described as a filth-ridden home after abandoned by their mother for a weekend getaway to an Orlando theme park. Authorities were alerted to the Port Charlotte home's deplorable and unsafe conditions on Sunday when the 10-year-old knocked on a neighbour's door saying she was hungry. Entering the home police described it filled with flies, rotting and mouldy food, piled trash bags and dog faeces scattering the floor with signs of having been walked through. The youngest three-year-old girl was described by officers as filthy, wearing oversized clothing and running around barefoot in the home's waste. In the master bedroom 'littered with piles of dirty clothes and old food containers,' they reported finding the 87-year-old great-grandmother, bedridden and smelling of urine. 'Deputies learned she had fallen four days before, urinated in her bed and was very confused,' police said in a release. The woman was taken to Fawcett Memorial Hospital where detectives were told she 'had dried feces and dirt on the bottom of her feet. 'The top of her feet showed brown substance squished up between her toes consistent with stepping in a pile of dog feces.' Deplorable: Police found the home's condition unlivable with no clear path to the one working toilet, pictured, and the one shower filled with clothes and broken toys . Wall-to-wall waste: Police described the home as smelling of rotting food, faeces, diapers and piled trash bags . The home was deemed uninhabitable under its current conditions, with one working bathroom whose walkway was caked with clothes and soiled baby diapers. The one shower in the house was described as stopped up and filled with clothes, broken toys and other items. Returning home to the investigation with her eldest 14-year-old daughter around 8.30pm, mother Susan Christine Warner was described as 'screaming and crying' at the scene. Warner acknowledged the filth and apologized but said she had been suffering depression ever since her husband was incarcerated in June and had to get away. Neglect: The home's bathroom is seen lined with waste and clothing while just feet from where the great-grandmother laid in bed smelling of urine and her feet covered in faeces . Cry for help: A can of tomato soup is seen with multiple holes after the hungry 10-year-old unsuccessfully tried to open it while right another area of the home is seen piled with trash and other items . She said she had driven to Universal Studio's Halloween Horror Nights on Friday with her 14-year-old - an approximately three-hour drive - but arriving too late to attend the event, they spent the night. She promised to clean the house up and said she thought her two youngest children would be all right with an adult, the 87-year-old woman, being around. Warner's three children were turned over to the care of a family member after sharing pizza purchased by the concerned neighbor. Charged with two counts of child neglect and one for neglect of an elderly person, Warner was taken to the Charlotte County Jail and held without bond.","Sisters, aged three and ten, found at home after they knocked neighbor's door saying they were hungry .

Paul and Clare Coulston have been making guardianship arrangements for their daughter Evelyn, four, and son Finlay, six. Mrs Coulston, 36, a police sergeant, has been given just a 30 per cent chance of surviving an aggressive form of oesophageal cancer. She was diagnosed in 2009. Mr Coulston, 37, a deputy headteacher, has been told he has between three and five years to live with Motor Neurone Disease (MND). Guardianship arrangements: Paul and Clare Coulston with son Finlay, six and daughter Evelyn Coulston, four . Double diagnosis: Mrs Coulston was told she had oesophageal cancer and her husband found out he has Motor Neurone Disease . He was diagnosed in April with the progressive condition which attacks the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, stopping the muscles working. To watch them joking with one another, laughing and smiling as they play with their children, it is hard to believe any heartache lies behind the Coulston’s perfect family picture. But the couple, of Ulverston, Cumbria, are having to make plans no parents of young children should ever have to make. Mrs Coulston said: 'We’ve had to think about guardianship for the children, trustees - all the questions you don’t want to have to ask or the places you don’t want to go, we’ve had to sit down and realistically think about.' Her husband added: 'We’re lucky in that we’ve got a really good support network of family and friends. That’s everything - it’s what keeps you going day to day. 'Last summer I thought I’d injured my hip - I was struggling to walk on my right leg. Then just before Christmas, when I was on the treadmill, my right leg kept catching. I was able to lift more weights with my left hand than with my right.' He was finally diagnosed in April. 'All I knew about Motor Neurone Disease was Stephen Hawking,' he said. As MND affects everyone differently, some people live for longer than five years, while others have less than three. Mr Coulston is taking drugs aimed at slowing the disease's progress, and is back at work as deputy head of St George’s Primary School in Barrow. At play: Mrs Coulston has been given just a 30 per cent chance of surviving an aggressive form of cancer . Proud father: Mr Coulston is taking drugs aimed at slowing the progress of his Motor Neurone Disease, and is back at work as deputy headteacher . He said: 'I’m just getting through each day. When I need a lift, I’ll plan for it then, when I need help from social workers, I’ll call. 'At the moment I get up and think ""I can still do that today"", rather than about what I won’t be able to do in a year.' But the couple are having to face some of their fears head on, because of Mrs Coulston’s condition. She was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in October 2009 and, while she underwent surgery and two courses of chemotherapy, was told she only had 30 per cent chance of living five years. While she is currently clear of cancer, Mrs Coulston said: 'A lot of the time, it’s at the three or four year mark when it recurs. 'It was quite far advanced and it was in my lymph nodes, so there’s always the chance that it’s somewhere else we don’t know about.' In a bid to support the couple, close friend Adele Dean and Mrs Coulston’s mother, Sue Hudson, are hosting a fundraiser in Barrow tonight. The couple want to take their children on a special holiday, but a lot of the money raised will cover adjustments needed to their home as Mr Coulston’s condition deteriorates, and financial support when he can no longer work. Despite being 'nervous' about tonight’s event, Mr Coulston said: 'We’re really grateful for all the effort that’s gone into organising it, all the people who’ve donated prizes or their services, everyone who comes or who’s made donations because they can’t. 'The way people want to help us, it’s just amazing.'","Paul and Clare Coulston have been making guardianship arrangements .

Politicians, celebrities, business leaders and cultural icons are alleged to be at the heart of the corruption and tax dodging that is rampant in Greece. There is massive pressure on the country to clean up its act to stave off bankruptcy and stay in the euro. But tax records exposed in Germany show incredible fiddling while the country's finances burn. One individual who declared an annual income of £21,000 siphoned £45 million into foreign banks. Politicians and celebrities are on a 54,000 strong list of people linked to Greek corruption. Here protesting journalists shout slogans and carry a banner reading 'Don't let those trying to eat you fill their bellies' Another, who declared less than £4,000 in 2010, deposited an astonishing £17 million pounds offshore. A third person claimed to have no income the same year - but sent more than £6 million overseas. Investigators from 'troika' - the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund, and the . European Central Bank - are tasked with getting Greece to knuckle down. It has pledged to implement reforms to put an end to the criminality. German press reports claim there are 54,000 people on lists being studied by the Greek Finance Ministry. Their tax returns are said to bear no resemblance to their actual finances. One person declared less than £4,000 in 2010 but deposited £17 million offshore. But the poor and homeless are forced to live off food donated by the Greek church . Celebrities, politicians, business leaders and cultural figureheads are all mentioned - as well as details of 1,991 known Swiss bank accounts. Greece's Financial and Economic Crime Unit, the SDOE, has not acted on information supplied by overseas banks to the IMF. Now Germany's Spiegel magazine has claimed at least 60 politicians - who are meant to be getting Greece out of the mire - are among tax cheats. High-ranking former ministers are among those suspected of involvement in bogus transactions and money-laundering. The former prefect of Thessaloniki city, Panagiotis Psomiadis, is alleged to have received nearly €1 million - more than £810,000 - for public works projects that were never built. He is also suspected of being connected with a mafia ring of loan sharks. Transparency International Greece chairman, Costas Bakouris, believes the country is 'very bad now as a society'. These men and women were among those queueing to be fed in Athens today. Costas Bakouris is chairman of Transparency International Greece. The 75-year-old said: 'We are very bad now as a society. We have become bad. We are greedy and asocial.' 'Now that it's clear that the creditors will continue to pay, people are turning a blind eye to the inevitable'. He claimed an 'incompetent political class' continued to rule Greece. According to Spiegel, investigators even discovered €2.8 million - more than £2.2 million - in an account belonging to the deputy mayor of a town of 14,000 people in Greece's Thessaly region. None was declared. 'The man receives a monthly salary of approximately €1,500,' said the magazine. The troika is aghast that the IKA, Greece's social security agency, has been used as 'personal piggy bank' by managers. Funds intended for the poor have been paid to family, friends and themselves. Of 700 people registered blind on the island of Zakynthos only 60 are genuine. Money for bogus claims has been siphoned off by crooks in the IKA. Bakouris claimed Greece had 'all the right conditions for corruption'. He said there was 'plenty of bureaucracy, no functioning justice system, laws with numerous loopholes and economic pressure.' Only one senior politician is so far facing corruption charges. Ex-defence minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos has been in jail awaiting trial for the past six months. He is alleged to have accepted millions of euros in kickbacks for projects.","Politicians and celebrities on list of 54,000 investigated for corruption .

The young boy appears to cry out in pain as he is hoisted into the air by 20-year-old Yan Yanhong. A further 702 photos of Ms Yanhong's class in Wenling, Zhejiang Province, show children with buckets on their heads, with their mouths taped shut and dumped headfirst into wastepaper bins.

Painful punishment: Another child is forced to lie in an awkward, crab-like pose with his head on a chair . Another shows a shelf in the classroom littered with empty beer bottles. The teacher exposed her own appalling . behaviour by sending the shocking image to a friend, prompting a storm . of criticism after it was posted online. Ms Yanhong defended her actions in lifting the boy up by the ears, saying: ‘I see him as a . good friend, and just made fun with him. ‘I just wanted to take a picture, and after taking the picture, I instantly put him down.’ The local education bureau said Ms Yanhong had now been dismissed and the school 'punished'. The disgraceful pictures emerged following a recent scandal over CCTV footage showing another Chinese schoolteacher repeatedly slapping her pupils.

She was filmed hitting four children more than 120 times after they failed to answer questions. The disturbing 30-minute CCTV footage of her slapping and kicking pupils was recorded at a pre-school in Taiyuan, in the northern Shanxi Province. The incident came to light after the father of one of the little girls, named only as Mr Han, came home to find his daughter's face red and swollen. Mr Han visited his daughter’s playschool and demanded to see the CCTV tapes, which revealed the teacher abusing his daughter and three other children.

He added: ‘The teacher asked my daughter to add numbers more than ten. My daughter told her that she can't solve it, and then the teacher slapped her.’ The teacher in question has been sacked from the pre-school.","Yan Yanhong said she and the boy were 'good friends' and 'having fun'

"By . Rick Dewsbury . PUBLISHED: . 07:42 EST, 3 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:18 EST, 3 May 2012 . The Serious Organised Crime Agency's website was temporarily shut down today after a cyber attack. It was the victim of a scam known as distributed denial of service (DDOS) whereby an internet address is flooded with bogus traffic, effectively making it unreachable. The actions can also jam other websites hosted by the same provider which is why the agency decided to go offline. A SOCA spokesman said: 'It is important to stress this is not a hacking attack. A DDOS is entirely different where a large number of computers try to access the site at the same time. Danger: Similar attacks on the Soca website have previously been linked to the 'hacktivist' group Anonymous . 'The huge flow of traffic causes the . website to potentially fall over. We took the decision to take down the . site at 10pm last night to limit the impact on other clients hosted by . the same service provider. 'It is a temporary inconvenience and . we will put the site back up once the action stops. We cannot say at the . moment when that might be.' He went on: 'It is also important to . stress there was no security risk and the website only contains . publicly available information, it does not provide access to . operational material.' DDOS attacks on the Soca website have previously been linked to the loose-knit international 'hacktivist' group Anonymous. The spokesman added that it would 'not be appropriate' to comment on who may have been responsible. Soca has recently closed 36 websites . believed to be selling stolen credit card information. Last month, Soca . was part of a joint effort with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation . to shut websites associated with selling stolen financial information. The agency said 2.5 million items of compromised data was recovered, preventing an estimated potential fraud of £500m. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair speaks during the official launch of Serious Organised Crime Agency in 2006 . The website has been targeted in the . past by members of 'hacktivist' group LulzSec. In June 2011, they forced . the site offline using similar tactics. Graham Cluley, of anti computer virus . firm Sophos based in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, described the attack as a . 'thump on the nose rather than a mortal blow.' He said: 'It is not impossible to stop . this sort of thing from happening, but quite costly, and SOCA may want . to look at what they have in place to prevent future occurrences. 'Government websites expect to be . atacked from time to time and it is just an inconvenience. Large numbers . of people visit the website for legitimate reasons and at the moment . are unable to do so. 'The attack could be linked to LulzSec or other hacking groups. It is likely to be connected to SOCA's work. 'Yesterday, a number of British and . Irish suspects were arrested in the US over a hacking inquiry so that . could also be significant.' He added: 'This is the second time in . less than a year that SOCA's website has found itself the target of . malicious attackers, having previously suffered from a DDoS attack at . the hands of the notorious LulzSec gang in June 2011. 'Some may suspect a LulzSec . sympathiser is behind the attack, as yesterday US prosectors made public . an indictment against four British and Irish men, suspected of being . involved in an internet attack on the Stratfor security analysis firm . last year.' Until yesterday, only Jeremy Hammond, a 27-year-old from Chicago, had been charged in relation to the Stratfor security breach. But now Donncha O'Cearrbhail (aka .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 12:08 EST, 19 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:06 EST, 20 October 2012 . Relatives of soldiers killed while patrolling in Snatch Land Rovers have won the right to sue the Government for compensation. Dozens of servicemen and women have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan while patrolling in the Land Rovers - grimly dubbed ‘mobile coffins’ by soldiers. Families of several servicemen are now claiming damages over the deaths - claiming the Ministry of Defence put soldiers’ lives at risk by ordering them to patrol in the vehicles, which offered practically no protection against roadside bombs. Soldiers killed in a Snatch Land Rover, pictured, can now sue the Government . The British Army replaced the 'mobile coffins' with armoured Ocelot vehicles, pictured, in around 2010 . They claim that proper equipment would have prevented the deaths. Yesterday Judges at the Court of Appeal in London ruled that the families could sue the Government for negligence - saying the Ministry of Defence had a duty of care over its personnel even when they were on the battlefield. Lawyers representing the families hailed the decision as a landmark ruling. The decision opens the door for civil action which could leave defence chiefs with a multi-million pound bill for damages. Last night, a senior MP warned the ruling would have far-reaching consequences for generals making decisions on the battlefield. And campaigners against secret courts warned Government proposals to expand secrecy in the justice system could mean such cases are hidden from public view in future. The legal action was brought following the deaths of a number of British soldiers following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Private Phillip Hewett, 21, of Tamworth, died in July 2005 when his lightly armoured Snatch Land Rover was blown up. A Challenger 2 tank moves through the Iraqi city of Basra. Corporal Stephen Allbutt died and others were injured when one tank hit another (stock image) Similar explosions claimed the lives of Private Lee Ellis, 23, of Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, in February 2006, and Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath, 22, of Romford, Essex, in August 2007. Corporal Stephen Allbutt, 35, of Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, died in a ‘friendly fire’ incident in March 2003 when his Challenger 2 tank was hit by another. Soldiers Dan Twiddy, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, and Andy Julien, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, were badly hurt in the incident. Pte Hewett’s mother Sue Smith, 51, of Tamworth, Staffordshire accused defence chiefs of having a ‘despicable’ attitude. She summed it up as: ‘They are Action Men. If you break them, just bury them. ‘But they are not just Action Men. People need to make a stand.’ The MoD argued that decisions about battlefield equipment were for politicians and military commanders. Following a hearing in London in June Lord Neuberger, Lord Justice Moses and Lord Justice Rimer ruled in favour of the families, who argued the MoD had failed to provide armoured vehicles or equipment which could have saved lives. Lord Neuberger (pictured), Lord Jusice Moses and Lord Justice Rimer ruled in favour of the families . Shubhaa Srinivasan, a partner with law firm Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘We maintain that the MoD’s position has been morally and legally indefensible, as they owe a duty of care to those who fight on behalf of this country. ‘British troops should at the very least have adequate equipment and training, ranging from the very basic such as GPS devices, to sophisticated satellite tracker systems, which the Americans had available to them. ‘It seems incredible that it was often left up to soldiers themselves to buy this equipment as they felt compelled to, so as to better protect their own lives and the lives of those they were responsible for.' James Arbuthnot, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Radio 4: ‘It’s not just that the MoD is now going to owe a duty of care in relation to all the equipment procurement decisions it makes, but also in relation to everything that an officer or a soldier does actually in the course of battle. ‘I think the MoD had rather relied until now on the idea that if you decide to be a soldier, then you take with that decision the risks that naturally come with it - you put yourself in harm’s way with your eyes open. ‘That argument is really going to be much reduced in strength now, so the MoD is going to have to set out an entirely new set of training to work out what the consequences of this decision are going to be.’ Clare Algar, executive director of campaign group Reprieve, said: ‘The sweeping powers which the secret courts Bill grants the Government will make it near impossible to hold ministers to account for wrongdoing in a wide range of cases. ‘Those in which service personnel and their families have suffered as a result of state negligence is one example. ‘The Bill would in future give ministers the power to push this into a secret court by claiming matters of national security are involved. An MoD spokesman said later: ‘Our thoughts and concerns remain with those that were injured and the families of those that sadly lost their lives. ‘We are considering the judgment by the Court of Appeal and as this is likely to be subject to further legal action it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.’","Dozens of soldiers have been killed in Land Rovers in Iraq and Afghanistan .

Chilling photos show killer cab driver Christopher Halliwell prowling the streets for a victim on the night he murdered office worker Sian O'Callaghan. A series of CCTV images show him cruising though Swindon in Wiltshire in his green Toyota Avensis searching for a victim after clocking off from his shift. He found his pretty victim after she . left a city centre nightclub shortly before 3am - but it would have . quickly become apparent to the terrified young woman that she was not being . driven to the home she shared with her boyfriend Kevin Reape. Chris Halliwell is captured on CCTV in his green Toyota Avensis cruising the streets searching for a victim . The minicab driver is spotted driving along Victoria Road in Swindon, Wiltshire, on the night of Sian O'Callaghan's death . Further images show him outside the Goddard Arms pub in Swindon before he selected his victim . The timeline of images helped lead police to the savage killer, who yesterday was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years after pleading guilty to the murder of 22-year-old Miss O'Callaghan on March 19 last year. When police tracked down the 48-year-old murderer, he was sickeningly displaying a missing person's poster in the back window of his car - which he had used to drive the terrified office worker to a nearby forest where he killed her. Colleagues said he had also callously discussed her disappearance with them, as he pretended to be helping in the search for missing woman. In fact the taxi driver knew exactly where the young woman was. After picking up Miss O'Callaghan, he drove her to nearby Savernake Forest where he sexually assaulted her and stabbed her to death. In the six days before he was arrested by police, he moved the woman's half-naked body to near the Uffington White Horse landmark in Oxfordshire - 15 miles from where she lived. Other CCTV images show him calmly filling up with petrol and paying at a cash desk displaying the missing person poster after the murder. The prowling taxi driver now faces questioning over a string of unsolved killings, it emerged last night. But . last night sources revealed he could now face questioning over the . disappearance of Melanie Hall – who vanished outside a nightclub in 1996 . and whose body was found by the M5. He is also likely to be quizzed over the whereabouts of two other women who both lived in Halliwell’s home town of Swindon. Detectives have discovered Halliwell . owned 80 cars over the years and have since tried to trace their current . owners through the DVLA in case forensic evidence can still be . recovered. Police were further worried when a . colleague said Halliwell had speculated about there being lots of bodies . buried while discussing Miss O’Callaghan’s disappearance. Guilty plea: Christopher Halliwell, left, today pleaded guilty to the murder of Sian O'Callaghan, 22, right, who disappeared after leaving Swindon's Suju nightclub in March last year . Killer Halliwell pretended to be helping in the search for the missing 22-year-old by displaying a 'missing person' picture in the back of his car . He told him: ‘Who knows what or who you find buried out there? There could be loads of people over the years.’ He led detectives to Miss . O’Callaghan’s body on the day he was arrested, it was found face down . and naked from her waist to her ankles. A swab subsequently revealed she may have been bitten on the left breast by her killer. Detectives in neighbouring force Avon . and Somerset have told their Wiltshire counterparts they believe he is . the strongest suspect yet for the murder of Melanie Hall. The officer in charge of the investigation said the disappearance of the university graduate 16 years ago is ‘top of our list’. Similar to Miss O’Callaghan’s . abduction, the petite blonde was last seen leaving a nightclub in Bath . in 1996. Her remains were found tied together with a piece of blue rope . beside the M5 in south Gloucestershire in 2009. Officers have been informed that . Halliwell was working as a taxi driver during this period and could have . been taking bookings in the city. His internet history also revealed he . heavily researched rope knots and binding techniques. The disposal of . her body is also extremely similar to that of Miss O’Callaghan’s. Other cases being looked at include . those of prostitute Sally Ann John, 24, from Swindon, who went missing . in 1995 and lived in the same street as Halliwell, and Vietnamese . immigrant Thi Hai Nguyen, 20, who vanished from Swindon in 2005. Several books on DNA and forensic testing were found in his loft along with a stash of wet wipes. Sentencing Halliwell to a minimum of . 25 years for Miss O’Callaghan’s murder, Mrs Laura Justice Cox DBE said: . ‘You abused your position as a taxi driver... and as someone Sian . thought she could trust. There was here a prolonged period of time in . which she would have suffered extreme fear and terror as well as severe . pain from the injuries you inflicted upon her.’ Last moments: Sian O'Callaghan was captured on CCTV cameras leaving the Suju nightclub, left, and walking towards her home (right) on the night she was murdered by Chris Halliwell in March 2011 . Miss O’Callaghan’s mother Elaine said: . ‘There is never total closure, just accepting my life has changed for . ever. I am just a mother who wants her daughter back.’ Speaking outside the court today, Miss . O'Callaghan's mother Elaine described her daughter as an 'incredible . person' and said she  would 'continue to inspire' her family. 'Christopher Halliwell has by his actions taken my daughter and caused unimaginable distress,' she said. 'The sentencing today of Halliwell will not bring Sian back, but will mean he can't take any more. Killer: Traces of Miss O'Callaghan's blood were found in the back of Christopher Halliwell's taxi . We will all endeavour to get on with our lives, the way Sian would have wanted,' she said. Sian's father Mick welcomed the life sentence for his daughter's killer. 'Justice has been done today,' he said, before thanking the family's QC, the CPS and police. 'It has been a very emotional day.' Referring to the withdrawal of the separate charge against Halliwell related to the death of Becky Godden-Edwards, Mr O'Callaghan said: 'Our thoughts go to Becky's family.' Becky Godden-Edwards devastated mother Karen Edwards tearfully described her family's anguish outside the court following today's hearing. The mother gave an emotional speech . about how her daughter had become addicted to drugs, but she had never . given up hope that one day she would return home to her family. 'After a very complicated and painful journey over the last 18 months Sian's family have today had the justice for murder of their beautiful daughter,' she said. 'However, our family's fight for justice for Becky has only just begun. 'Even though Becky has been found, after all this time we still have no full understanding of how she met her death. 'As you can imagine this has been a very dreadful time for all our family and I would like to thank everyone for the continued support in our struggle for justice for Becky. 'I would like the full support of you all to help me get justice for my daughter Becky,' she added.

IPCC commissioner Naseem Malik said: 'Now that the criminal process has concluded the IPCC can start its investigation into the police investigation into the tragic deaths of these two young women. 'We were unable to start work before criminal proceedings concluded on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service. 'I have no doubt that there will be considerable interest in the circumstances that led to the IPCC investigations but I would urge patience while we find out what happened. 'The IPCC has already concluded an independent investigation into five complaints against Wiltshire Police relating to the actions of the police during the investigation. 'Three of these complaints were upheld and the force has agreed our recommendation to offer the complainant an apology. 'The force has also confirmed to the IPCC that it has accepted our recommendation that it reviews its family liaison policy.'

Kremlin president Vladimir Putin today demanded visa-free travel between Russia and all EU countries including Britain as the price of an oil-fuelled rouble boost for Europe. He wants governments all over the continent to tear down their strict entry requirements for Russians, and says he will do the same in return. With up to 400,000 Russians already in Britain, the fear of such a policy is a flood of new employment and social security migrants,  and the arrival of criminal and mafia elements as well as spies. Tough talks: Russian President Vladimir Putin (C), European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (L) and President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy (R) pose during an EU-Russia summit in Strelna, outside St. Petersburg . But the Moscow strongman - back in the Kremlin hot seat after a four year absence - rammed home the message at an EU summit in St Petersburg that he sees this goal as an essential pre-requisite of closer co-operation and the opening of the lucrative Russian market. He called on Britain and other EU countries to shed their 'stereotypes' and ideological prejudices concerning Moscow and instead adopt a 'pragmatic, businesslike approach'. 'A true partnership is impossible when there is a visa barrier,' he said at the start of the talks with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. He taunted Britain over fears of a criminal influx by implying it has already given a safe haven to those wanted for crimes in Russia. He has a major gripe with London over political asylum and residency  given to dozens of Russians he regards as money launderers, embezzlers, crime kings and even terrorists. 'I believe the fears about an inflow of labour migrants from Russia are exaggerated,' he said. 'The criminal elements who want to go to Europe, they all are already there. And they are travelling back and forwards without any visas using their own instruments.' Demands: Putin called for a 'pragmatic, businesslike approach without any ideological or other stereotypes', a veiled warning to the EU to treat Russia as an equal and steer clear of preaching on political issues . Russia and the EU are deeply intertwined, with Europe relying heavily on Russian energy exports and Russia buying EU products from German cars to Italian olive oil and Scandinavian furniture for the middle class . Moscow has blunted Western efforts to condemn Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and push him from power during 15 months of bloodshed Western nations blame on his government, whose forces have killed at least 9,000 people. Both Russia and Europe say they still support Kofi Annan's U.N.-backed peace plan, but EU nations would like Russia to press Assad harder to abide by a ceasefire demanded by the plan. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Aston said on Sunday that the crisis had reached a 'critical point' and that Russia's role was 'crucial.' Russia says it is not protecting Assad, who has given Moscow its firmest Middle East foothold, but that the Syrian leader's exit cannot be a precondition for political dialogue. Putin ceded no ground on Syria in remarks during visits to Berlin and Paris on Friday, placing an accent on rebel violence, criticising sanctions and saying political decisions could not be forced upon the country from outside. Ashton, who met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday, said the EU wanted to 'work closely with Russia to find a way to end the violence' and that 'Russia's role is crucial for the success of Annan's plan'. The statement said she and Anan agreed the crisis had reached a 'critical point'. However, when asked whether he expected the summit to narrow the gap on Syria, Lavrov told reporters: 'I don't think so.' He claimed the main visa curbs hit . 'lawful businessmen, reporters, and those who would like to support . personal relations with their friends and relatives in European . countries or in Russia'. In a swipe at France and Germany, he . claimed visas issued to his travelling media corps last week were for . one day only which meant that when his Berlin press conference overran . and midnight approached, journalists risked becoming overstaying . illegally in the EU. 'Their visas were under threat of running out. Were they supposed to stand up and leave? he asked. Diplomats saw his new demand as part . of a new uncompromising approach in negotiating with the West which . badly needs an economic boost from Russia. A British source said: 'The Russians . are piling on pressure on visas but there is no way we can allow open . entry. If it would happen tomorrow we could imagine an influx of people . arriving to immediately claim asylum from Putin's regime.' It is only two months since warnings . were sounded over the rising level of Russian spying in Britain, with . one estimate suggesting at least 40 agents operate in the country at any . one time. Yet pressure is also likely from the . EU where Van Rompuy calls visa-free travel a 'common goal' and Antonio . Tajani, the European Commissioner responsible for tourism, is in favour . of a massive easing of visa curbs on Russians. 'Of course it's important to work for . security, but at the same time our economy is very important,' he said . earlier this year.","Russia's president Vladimir Putin said the European Union must shed 'stereotypes' about the country .

The founder of StandUp for Kids, the national group for at-risk and homeless children, has been arrested in Aurora, Colorado on child sexual assault charges. Richard Koca Sr., 69, faces seven felony counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust involving a pattern of abuse, according to an Arapahoe County Court case summary. The court record indicates the alleged abuse began in August 2009 and continued into 2012. Aurora police spokeswoman Sgt. Cassidee Carlson said Koca was arrested Saturday on a felony arrant for sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust for acts with a child he was supervising in Aurora. Richard Koca, 69, faces seven felony counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust involving a pattern of abuse . Carlson said the investigation, which began on Aug. 29, has identified a single juvenile victim. However, police said that because of Koca’s extensive contact over the past several decades with juveniles through his work with several non-profit organizations that primarily serve children, there are concerns that there may be additional victims. 'We're aware of the fact that there might be other victims out there. We're encouraging them to come forward,' Carlson told 7NEWS. Koca made his first court appearance Monday in Arapahoe County. He is being held in the Arapahoe County Jail on $250,000 bond.

'He placed himself in situations where there were youth around with the facade that he was doing good,' Carlson said. Koca founded StandUp for Kids in San Diego in 1990. The nonprofit, now based in Atlanta, reports involvement with programs in 37 cities nationwide. Justine Madison, the organization's interim national director, said StandUp for Kids - or SUFK - has not been contacted by law enforcement about Koca. 'However, if contacted, the organization intends to cooperate fully,' Madison said. The statement said Koca retired from his position as SUFK's chief executive officer in June 2010.

The abduction and suspected murder of five-year-old April Jones shocked the nation and sparked an outpouring of grief that saw crowds gather for a procession through her Welsh hometown in a show of support for her devastated family. But as hundreds of people turned out in Machynlleth to sympathise with the family following Mark Bridger's arrest on suspicion of killing the schoolgirl, internet trolls compounded their misery by posting false accusations and insults aimed at April's relatives on Facebook. Almost 1,000 people have joined the online group, called Mark Bridger - Guilty Or Not Guilty - Have Your Say, which police have vowed to shut down. Vanished: April went missing after she was seen getting into a car near her home on the Bryn-y-Gog estate in the rural Welsh town of Machynlleth . Bridger, 46, who is known to April's family, has been charged with murder, child abduction, and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mark Bridger has been charged with child adbuction, murder and perverting the course of justice . Facebook users had posted comments about April's heartbroken mother Coral Jones, 40, on the webpage, and criticised the pink ribbon campaign she devised to help keep the search for her cherished daughter at the forefront of peoples' minds, according to a report in the Daily Star. Others posted speculation about what happened to the little girl, despite the fact that public discussion of the case is forbidden under contempt-of-court laws until the trial concludes. Some members of the group reportedly claim to be from around April's home town of Machynlleth. A police spokesman told the newspaper: 'We will take immediate steps to get this closed down.' Today some comments and users had been deleted from the page, which is visible to members only. A week ago more than 700 people gathered at the Bryn-y-Gog estate and walked through Machynlleth in a silent procession to St Peter's Church to pay their respects at an emotional service for missing April. Many people in the crowd wore pink ribbons, symbolising the fading hope the schoolgirl could still be alive. The five-year-old is still missing despite an exhaustive search which initially saw members of the public join police officers in combing the areas around Machynlleth for clues to the youngsters whereabouts. April's parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 44, were 'too upset' to attend the service. Support: Hundreds of people made their way through Machynlleth on Sunday to attend a service for April in St Peter's Church . Police looking for April have denied the search is scaling down 13 days after she first went missing. Officers from all over the UK have joined in the hunt for her, while volunteers from the ambulance service and the Coastguard are also continuing to search. A spokeswoman for Dyfed Powys Police said: 'Over the weekend the search for April Jones continues with teams carefully examining many different areas. 'The area in and around Machynlleth is large and we are continuing to put a huge level of resource into the search. As time passes and we work through the detailed plan, we will of course conclude our searches in particular areas. 'Whilst we have almost completed the searches in the town centre area, outside this small vicinity there is still a lot to do. The search continues at the same level of intensity that we have seen all last week. Police are continuing in their hunt for April and have widened the search area to around Machynlleth . 'We have a number of areas and locations identified that require a detailed, methodical forensic search.' Superintendent Ian John, who is leading the search, said yesterday his search teams remain committed to finding the little girl. The area searched last week alone would take one person almost nine years to complete on their own, police said. Specially trained officers are continuing to support April's family who are being updated about the search operation. A fundraising walk in support of the April Jones fund, set up by Machynlleth Town Council, is to take place in Penarth tomorrow, while thousands of pink ribbons, which became a symbol of hope for the youngster being found, continue to be put up across Wales. The ribbons were also worn by the Wales football team during the national anthems and line-ups ahead of their match against Scotland at Cardiff City Stadium last night. Mark Bridger, 46, appeared in court on Wednesday accused of abducting and murdering April, and of unlawfully disposing of and concealing her body with intent to pervert the course of justice. Mr Johns said yesterday his teams had almost completed their searches in Machynlleth town. He said that over the weekend they would focus the search operation in the Ceinws area and the surrounding towns and villages. The search plan was developed between the force's own police search advisers and the national police search centre, which has consulted worldwide with others with similar experience. 'The detailed plan that we've put together is very robust and that is the main drive for our search operation,' he said. 'It's a very professional and methodical search. It is a very emotional time for the town of Machynlleth here, but we are police officers, we are professionals and we've got to try to take some of the emotion out of that so that we can do the best job for the family.'

A wife who saw her husband killed by Mexican drug cartels as they jet-skied together on the Texas border has spoken of her relief after a crime boss was arrested over the murder. Tiffany Hartley was with her husband David Hartley on Lake Falcon when he was shot in the back of the head in 2010 by a gang who approached them in boats. Police in Mexico on Saturday rounded up the drug cartel boss believed to be responsible for the killing Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo, a Zetas cartel leader is known as 'Commander Squirrel.' He has been linked to numerous crimes, such as the escape of 151 prisoners in 2010 from a jail in the city of Nuevo Laredo and the recent flight of 131 prisoners in the city of Piedras Negras. Scroll down for video . Squirrel: Salvador Alfonso Martinez Escobedo, a Zetas cartel leader, was arrested on Saturday . Tragedy: David Hartley, left, was shot and killed as he was exploring Falcon Lake with his wife Tiffany, right . Escobedo was also wanted for his alleged role in the September 2010 killing of David Hartley on Falcon Lake, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border. The Mexican Navy said in a statement: 'Squirrel is credited with being the mastermind of the deaths of 72 undocumented migrants in San Fernando. '[He] is the alleged perpetrator of the narco graves found in Tamaulipas state, with more than 200 bodies and the execution of more than 50 people by his own hand in different parts of the republic, [as well as] the murder of David Hartley, an American citizen killed at Falcon Dam on September 30, 2010.' Grief: Tiffany Hartley, speaking from her La Salle, Colorado home on Monday, said she hoped that Escobedo could lead authorities to her husband's remains . When asked if she had confidence that Mexican authorities arrested the man responsible for her husband's death, Tiffany Hartley said: 'It's really hard to really feel like this is going to be the final, but at the same time we're very hopeful that it will because we want some closure as a family.' She said she was hoping for more details on how Martinez might be linked to her husband's death and also for information on where her husband's remains are so the family can move forward. 'But that's what we're really looking for is: What is his link to David and does he know where David's body is?' said Hartley, who lives in La Salle, Colorado.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 31 August 2012 . Police investigating the mysterious deaths of a pair of reclusive twin sisters, who were television stars, have finally contacted their family after an 11-day search. Three relatives - a cousin and two second cousins - have come forward to tell detectives about 1950s entertainers Patricia and Joan Miller, who were found dead last month in the California home they shared for almost 40 years. The sisters, who were 73, briefly appeared in a U.S. TV show, The Hoffman Hayride, and posed with singer and actor Bing Crosby as children. But they often shunned their neighbours and police had to make a public appeal and enlist the help of dozens of strangers to locate their next of kin after their bodies were discovered in South Lake Tahoe on February 26. Together: The bodies of twins Patricia and Joan Miller were found in the California home they shared for almost 40 years . Emails and phone calls poured in and, assisted by amateur genealogists . who read media accounts of the sisters' deaths, investigators were able to trace the cousins yesterday. The cousins said they had not heard from the sisters in years. Detective Matt Harwood, of the El Dorado County sheriff's office: 'They confirmed pretty much what everyone else told me. 'They were pretty reclusive and no one really knows why.' Detective Harwood said the cousins, . who do not share the sisters' surname, had told him they lost touch with . the women as other family members died. In one case, an amateur genealogist . had called one of the cousins to confirm their blood line before giving . the name to Detective Harwood. Harwood said the sisters deserved to . have their family know about their death, and he was pleased to complete . that mission with help from 'people from across the country, just your . Average Joe wanting to try their hand on genealogy.' He added: 'There's no way we could have done it . without you guys in the press and literally hundreds of people just . calling to help put the pieces together.' One of the second cousins lives in . the San Francisco Bay area, and the two other cousins live in Portland, . Oregon, where the twins grew up. Harwood said he had yet to find a . will but planned to give some of the twins' personal items, including . their mother's furniture and family photo albums, to the cousins. The discovery of next of kin provides some answers to the twins' mysterious end, but their puzzle is far from being solved. Medical investigators have been . unable to determine how or when the women died, but their decomposed . bodies suggest they had been dead for at least several weeks when they . were found . Toxicology reports will not be available for at least two more months. There was no blood, no signs of struggle . and nothing indicated that the women had persistent health . troubles. After a life in showbiz, dancing and . singing on TV as well as at several military bases with their mother on . piano, the twins spent their last decades as recluses who never married, . say police. Detectives said they found one of the sisters in her downstairs bedroom and the other in the hallway outside. They combed the home for information from documents and pictures. One photograph showed the women as young girls sitting on Mr Crosby's lap. Another showed them wearing tap dancing shoes. Their parents were 'heavily involved in their entertainment . business', police said. Detective Harwood said it was as if the two sisters, long each other's only companion, could not live without each other. 'My perception is one died and the other . couldn't handle it,' he added. 'It . appears purely natural, but we are still trying to piece it all . together.' It is unusual for police to release the names . of the dead without first informing their relatives, but the sisters' shrouded lives made that impossible, the detective said. 'The circumstance surrounding their . death is somewhat of an enigma,' he added. Icon: Detectives found a photograph of the sisters as children, sitting on the lap of actor and singer Bing Crosby, pictured . The deaths have confused some residents . in the resort town of South Lake Tahoe, where homeowners tend to be . close-knit and the sisters' reclusiveness had long inspired questions . and concern. In the past year, there were hints that . something was amiss at the Miller home. A neighbour spotted an ambulance . at the house a year ago and assumed they had fallen ill. Someone asked . police to check regularly on the house. When someone arrived on February 25 for . a routine check, no one answered the door. The next day, police forced . their way in and found the bodies. There was no blood, no signs of . struggle. Nothing indicated that the women had persistent health . troubles. Their longtime home was not disheveled or unkempt - potential . signs of mental or physical illness. Detective Harwood said he called a nearby centre for the elderly to see if the sisters were visitors, but no one there had heard . of them. He checked with Meals on Wheels volunteers, but the sisters did not appear to have received their services. The only relative he found . in his preliminary searches was the sisters' deceased mother. As news of the deaths spread, former . South Lake Tahoe residents called police to report that they had lived . near the sisters for decades in some cases, and had hardly seen them. One sent in a postcard that claimed the sisters were the only remaining . members of their family after their mother's death and their brother . died at war. Calls made to several longtime . residents and social groups in the area turned up little, as many . community leaders said they had never heard of the sisters. Joan Miller was a senior accounting . clerk in the payroll department at the Lake Tahoe Unified School . District from 1979 to 1984. Patricia Miller, who drove a white . convertible with red upholstery, worked in the El Dorado County's social . services office during that time. 'I never heard of anyone else being in . either of their lives,' said Betty Mitchell, 89, who supervised . Patricia Miller in the social services office and saw the twins around . town. 'They were inseparable and really identical.' The sisters were said to be friendly and often . told stories of their singing adventures. They told Mrs Mitchell they had . performed at Yosemite National Park and when their mother came to visit . from Oregon, they all dined at her home. But the sisters were also guarded.

Violent evening storms following a day of triple-digit temperatures wiped out power to as many as 3million people and caused at least fifteen fatalities across the country. Widespread power outages were reported from Indiana to New Jersey, with the bulk of the service interruptions concentrated on Washington, D.C., and the surrounding areas. Now, three states - Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia - have declared states of emergency, as temperatures again rise to dangerous levels. Hot and hazy: People crowd at the beach at Coney Island in Brooklyn today; about 3.9 million homes and businesses were without power on Saturday amid a record heat wave in the eastern United States after deadly thunderstorms downed power lines . Sardines: People crowd at the beach at Coney Island to escape near triple-digit temperatures . In addition to the heat, officials say cell phone coverage is spotty. Many residents were asked to conserve water because sewage stations had been without power for a time. And authorities cautioned people to drive carefully because tree limbs littered roads and hundreds of traffic signals were out. No power also meant no way to charge cellphones and laptops, and no Internet access in many areas. Earlier Friday, the nation's capital . reached 104 degrees - topping a record of 101 set in 1934. Temperatures . also soared to 118 degrees in Norton Dam, Kansas, an all-time high. The storms in D.C. also knocked out Amazon’s Cloud service in Northern Virginia, leaving those in the area without services like Netflix, Instagram, and Pinterest. More than 20 elderly residents at an apartment home in Indianapolis were displaced when the facility lost power due to a downed tree.

Surveying damage: Debris and downed trees are cluttering the streets in Northwest Virginia after massive storms blew through Washington DC . Crumbled: Resident David Fetchko surveys the damage done to the apartment of his girlfriend in Richmond, Virgina today . Long day ahead: Workers cut up a fallen tree, so that power lines can be repaired, on June 30 in Huntington, Maryland . Most were bused to a Red Cross facility to spend the night, and others who depend on oxygen assistance were given other accommodations, the fire department said. The storms, sometimes packing 70 mph winds, toppled three tractor trailers on Interstate 75 near Findlay, Ohio. Fallen trees were blamed on both deaths in Springfield, Virginia. Besides the 90-year-old woman, who authorities didn't identify pending notification of kin, a man driving his car was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities identified him as Khiet Nguyen, 27, of Burke, Virginia. In addition, a park police officer . was injured by an uprooted tree in the northern Virginia County, and an . 18-year-old man was struck by a power line, Jennings said. He was in . stable condition after receiving CPR, she said. Dark and stormy: Clouds roll over Lisle, lllinois, as a storm moves into the Chicago area today .

Forecasters warned that another round of storms was possible in the afternoon, which could complicate cleanup efforts. At least four utility poles fell on a . road in Columbus, Ohio, making it too dangerous for people in four cars . to get out, police said. One person was taken to a hospital. As of 1 a.m. Saturday, Pepco was . reporting 406,000 outages in the District of Columbia and Montgomery and . Prince George's counties, Maryland. Amtrak suspended its service from Washington, D.C., to Philadelphia due to the storms, at least until mid-morning. In the Washington, D.C., area, the Metrorail subway trains were returned to their endpoints due to the storms and related damage, officials said. 'It has had a widespread effect on the region,' Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said early Saturday. He said about 17 train stations were operating on backup power due to local power outages, but that he didn't anticipate service being disrupted on Saturday. Two young brothers, aged 3 and 5, in eastern Tennessee, had been playing outside on Thursday. The younger boy died later that day and his brother died on Friday afternoon, according to Eric Blach, administrator for the Bradley County Medical Examiner's Office.

The fierce heat had spread east from the central U.S., where temperatures continued to rewrite record books. Many areas of the country have suffered days of high temperatures and little rain, which have contributed to deadly and destructive fires in Colorado. The weather is expected to stay hot through the weekend in the same areas of the country, according to Mr Dlugoenski. 'The areas of high pressure are going to break down just a little bit as we head into the first part of next week,' he said. 'It will still be hot, but I think the record warmth will be more erratic.' The temperature in Nashville on Friday reached 109 degrees, smashing a record high for the city of 107 degrees reached on July 27 and July 28, 1952.

But when faced with a middle-aged man refusing to get out of the pool at a leisure centre, one over-eager police force did deem it appropriate to send in the ‘Swimming Squad’. As many as eight officers and four police cars were dispatched to the scene, before two policemen jumped into the water in full uniform to subdue the man. Scroll down to watch video . Extreme measures: Two fully clothed policemen waded into a swimming pool in Bournemouth, Dorset, to remove a man in his 50s who refused to leave . Disturbance: The man in his 50s had been causing a minor nuisance - shouting at children who splashed him . They restrained the swimmer, thought to be in his 50s, and used a children’s flotation device to drag him towards the side where several uniformed colleagues were waiting. The man was then hauled out of the  water, placed in handcuffs and led out of the pool area. Despite the dramatic police response, the swimmer was found to have committed no offence and was driven home by officers. Witnesses said the trouble at the pool in Bournemouth, Dorset, began when the man began shouting and swearing at children who had been splashing him in the water. Lifeguards asked him to leave but when he refused, police were called to help. Sharese Taylor, who was in the spectator area of the pool after having a swim, filmed the incident on her mobile phone. The 19-year-old sales assistant said the man had reacted angrily towards the children but claimed the police’s handling of the situation was ‘ridiculous’. Detained: The police officers got the man to the side of the pool where at least four uniformed colleagues were waiting . 'Over the top: Officers then bound his feet together and placed him in hand-cuffs . She said: ‘I had been in the pool and noticed a guy at the side who was leaning on his forearm and he appeared to be asleep. ‘I got out to get changed and  suddenly I heard shouting. ‘I went into the viewing area and the guy must have been splashed by a boy because he started shouting, “Get out of my way!” and swearing. ‘The lifeguard asked him to leave but he refused to. Suddenly eight police officers arrived in the pool area and two jumped in fully clothed, from different sides. ‘They used a long, red “noodle float” [a long, bendy foam cylinder] to pull him over to the side. It took about four policemen to hold him down and they used some kind of straps to tie his feet together. They then handcuffed him. ‘It was ridiculous that so many police turned up and that two of them went into the water. It seemed a bit over the top.’ She said that she saw four police cars outside the building. Dorset Police refused to confirm how many officers attended the incident at the Littledown leisure centre at teatime on Tuesday. Released: After seizing the swimmer at the Littledown centre, police found the man hadn't committed a crime and officers drove him home . Incident: Police said the officers were dealing with a potential breach of the peace in a 'high risk environment' But Chief Inspector Chris Weeks said the officers had dealt with a potential breach of the peace in a ‘high-risk environment’. He said: ‘Dorset Police responded to a report of an aggressive male shouting and swearing in a public place. ‘There were concerns for members of the public as this incident was taking place in a public swimming pool. The officers in attendance were faced with a potentially high-risk environment to work in where positive action was essential to prevent a breach of the peace.’ Colette Kiernander, the general manager at the Littledown centre, said: ‘There was an incident, which is currently being reviewed. Employees monitored the situation closely at all times in accordance with our procedures and I’d like to thank them and the authorities for their assistance.’ Now watch the video .","Man in his 50s was asked to leave the pool in Bournemouth, Dorset, after shouting at children who splashed him .

NatWest have finally fixed the computer meltdown which led to millions of their bank customers being unable to access their money for the past three days. The bank issued a statement this afternoon announcing they had solved the 'initial problem' and were working 'round the clock' to clear the backlog which is expected to continue into next week. Customers have been left unable to pay . bills, do their grocery shopping or make essential transfers since . Wednesday as a result of IT problems. No money: A mother with a baby passes a NatWest cashpoint which says millions have been left high and dry due to 'tecnical difficulties' in Olney, Buckinghamshire . Apologising to all their customers for . the technical glitch, the bank said:' We appreciate this has caused . an unacceptable level of inconvenience. 'We have fixed the initial problem and our priority has been to work round the clock to sort the backlog as soon as possible.' Today over 900 branches extended their opening hours until 6pm and will be open from 9am until Noon tomorrow to handle emergencies. NatWest - owned by taxpayer-funded RBS - admitted the breakdown resulted in money credited to customers accounts overnight not appearing in their balances 'as it should'. In some cases people were left homeless after the computer problems meant house purchases fell through. Others . were stranded abroad, unable to access funds which should have been in . their account. Angry customers said the bank's response was not good enough, with some vowing to take their business away as a result of the chaos. How it could affect you . The problem arose after staff tried to install a software update on RBS’s payment processing system, but ended up corrupting it. When checking their accounts on . Wednesday many customers found their balances had not updated properly . to show new payments in. This meant those relying on wages being paid in . were unable to pay their mortgage and other bills. Three days later, many of those . payments have still not appeared – meaning thousands of customers are . now likely to have been hit by penalty charges for missing the payments. Although the banking group has . promised that no one will be out of pocket as a result of the problems, . it may take weeks to clear the backlog of claims. The problems have hit 7.5million personal customers, many business customers and 100,000 customers of Ulster Bank. Messaging boards were flooded . yesterday with complaints from those who were unable to access wages or . who had their cards declined in shops. Lance King and his family were left homeless after the problems at NatWest caused their house purchase to fall through. He and wife Gemma had sold their . previous property, but could not move into their new one because IT . problems meant the money for the sale had failed to appear. Last night they and their two daughters, aged one and five, were forced to stay with Mrs King’s parents. ‘It is a complete nightmare,’ said Mr King, 34, from Whiteley, Hampshire. ‘We had a removal van outside the . house waiting to get in but because the money was in a NatWest account, . we couldn’t complete the sale. ‘All of our stuff is now in storage and my wife and two children are living with my in-laws. The stress has been horrendous.’ Although he is not a NatWest customer, Mr King’s move was brought to a halt because his solicitor’s account is with NatWest. ‘For a big corporate bank it is just unbelievable,’ he added. Also hit by the problem were first-time buyers Mike Johnson and his pregnant wife Laura. Logged off: NatWest posted a message to customers on its website this afternoon, explaining that the problems remained unresolved . Banking meltdown: NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland customers who had salaries, tax credits or other money paid into their account overnight were logging onto their accounts to find out it had not arrived . First-time buyer Milley Colley, 27, was unable to move into her new two-bedroom flat yesterday because NatWest had not transferred the money. She attempted to send the funds to her solicitor - two days before the problems officially begun - but they never arrived. The freelance photographer was supposed to move into a property in Bow, east London, but is still in her parents home in Teddington, south-west London, while she waits for the bank to deal with the problem. Banking error: Milley Colley, 27, left, was unable to complete her house purchase yesterday because of NatWest's payment problems while student Kora-Lee Holmes, 21, was stranded in Venice . 'The completion date was yesterday . but NatWest have been having problems since Tuesday. I went into a . branch to do a same day payment to my solicitor but that payment never . arrived,' she said. 'I phoned NatWest and the person told . me it had arrived and there was no problem. The money left my bank . immediately on Tuesday but has still not arrived. 'Then yesterday they said they did not know where the money had gone. 'I have got all my stuff packed up and I had taken the day off working yesterday and I was ready to go.' She is moving into the flat on her . own and has funded the purchase through a private family loan. Two other . people in the chain are believed to be affected. Meanwhile, student Kora-Lee Holmes, 21, was stranded in Venice, Italy, unable to pay her hotel for the stay because her bank card was not working. She missed her flight home while she . battled to make the payment so her father Adrian was forced to spend . £200 to re-book her on another one last night. The Hull University student said: 'I . tried paying the hotel with my NatWest Visa debit card but it didn't . work and when I got on my online banking I was unable to transfer any . money. 'I was trying to get the money paid . while all the time the clock was ticking down to when my flight took . off. I tried phoning NatWest but there was a 45 minute queue. 'I just got the standard response on . the website about a temporary problem with the site and that was at . 8.30am Italian time. This didn't help me.' She was flying back to Newcastle instead of Manchester because it was the only flight available. Anger: NatWest allowed customers to post their 'feedback' on their website - and people were using it to record their disgust . Helpful banking: A message on the NatWest sight warns that they are currently experiencing technical difficulties . As NatWest battled to get their computer systems up and running again, they allowed customers to post their 'ideas' directly onto their homepage. Irate customers unable to get hold of their money had a few comments Here are some of them: . 'All systems gone on strike until RBS/NatWest receive another bailout from the taxpayer' - lollollol . 'Account updated now but money is missing! Basically been called a liar on the phone by ""helpful"" staff. I'm going up there now ...' - BeyondAngry . The couple were thrown out of a house . they thought they had paid for on Thursday after the problems at . NatWest meant the payment did not go through as expected. The Johnsons had been allowed access . to the newly-built property after transferring the money to their . solicitor’s NatWest client account on Monday. But the balance still . hadn’t arrived on Thursday – so that evening the site manager arrived at . their house and asked them to leave. ‘We had to pack our bags then and there and we are now living with our sister-in-law until this is sorted out,’ Mr Johnson said. Mark Groom, of Groom Halliday . Property Solicitors, said: ‘If we can’t see the money - whether or not . it is actually there - a property sale simply cannot complete.

Andrew Mitchell faces the humiliation of a Commons vote on whether his pay should be docked for swearing at police. Labour yesterday tabled a motion that could see the Tory Chief Whip lose £1,000 after police claimed he called them ‘****ing plebs’ for refusing to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street. That is the amount Mr Mitchell could have been fined if, like most people who swear at a police officer, he had been successfully prosecuted. Under-fire: Labour tabled a motion that could see Andrew Mitchell lose £1,000 after police claimed he called them '****ing plebs' for refusing to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street . Labour is expected to force a vote . during the next opposition day debate – a move that could expose the . lack of support for Mr Mitchell among Lib Dem MPs and some Tories. Home Secretary: Theresa May said the police officers involved had accepted Mr Mitchell's apology 'and that is an end to it' Mr Mitchell has repeatedly denied . calling diplomatic protection officers ‘plebs’ but he has admitted . swearing, and London Mayor  Boris Johnson has said it would have been . ‘commonsensical’ for Mr Mitchell to be arrested. Under Section 5 of the Public Order . Act, guidelines for  magistrates suggest that anyone convicted of the . offence faces a fine equivalent to between 50 and 125 per cent of their . weekly income. Mr Mitchell’s salary as Chief Whip is more than £79,000 and his weekly income from it is around £1,500. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who tabled . the motion to dock Mr Mitchell’s pay, said: ‘We still don’t know what . exactly Andrew Mitchell said to the police  officers, nor has he offered . a proper apology. 'If the Prime Minister won’t act to clean up this mess then Parliament should do it for him.’ As Mr Mitchell took his place on the . government frontbench yesterday for the first time since his outburst . last month, he faced jeers from opposition MPs. And in the first public criticism from . his own party, former Tory whip Michael Fabricant, who returned to the . backbenches in  last month’s reshuffle, said that Mr Mitchell’s . predecessor Patrick McLoughlin, now Transport Secretary, is ‘sorely . missed as Chief Whip’. And during  Home Office questions, Labour MPs . repeatedly demanded that ministers condemn Mr Mitchell’s behaviour. Talks: Mr Mitchell met Police Federation officials at his constituency office in Sutton Coldfield on Friday . Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . sought to embarrass Home Secretary Theresa May by quoting her own words . to the Police Federation last year in which she said: ‘It’s easy to sit . round with friends and criticise the police. You put up with abuse and . worse, but you do so to keep us free. It’s time we gave you all the . respect you deserve.’ 'We still don’t know what . exactly Andrew Mitchell said to the police  officers, nor has he offered . a proper apology. If the Prime Minister won’t act to clean up this mess then Parliament should do it for him' Labour MP Simon Danczuk . Miss Cooper called for Mrs May to . condemn Mr Mitchell, but she refused. The Home Secretary said: ‘The . Chief Whip apologised to the police officers concerned and the police . accepted that apology. The police are not taking the matter any further, . and that is an end to it.’ Mr Mitchell roared ‘Hear, hear!’ as Mrs May . came to his defence. A Downing Street spokesman made clear . the Prime Minister has dug in his heels and is determined to hold on to . his Chief Whip. He said: ‘Andrew Mitchell behaved in a way that he . shouldn’t have towards a police officer, but he has apologised and that . apology has been accepted.’ Mr Mitchell faces a further ordeal . tomorrow when he will sit next to David Cameron during Prime Minister’s . Questions when he will inevitably be made the butt of Ed Miliband’s . attacks on the Government.

Initially developed by BBC engineers looking for ways to transmit subtitles, Ceefax was made possible by exploiting 'spare lines' in the analogue television signal that broadcast encoded information. Its first editor was veteran journalist Colin McIntyre, a former UN correspondent and chief publicity officer who initally updated 24 news pages himself by feeding punch tape into machines.

BBC Northern Ireland and UTV will tonight screen a simulcast reviewing the era of analogue TV and Dame Mary Peters - 1972 Olympic gold medallist in the pentathlon - will push the button ending the transmission at 11:30. These days when online journalists want to publish stories, all they have to do is click a button on screen to make a story live and viewable by readers all across the planet. By comparison, the early days of Ceefax proved anything but hi-tech. Journalists at the BBC Newsroom would monitor stories coming in on the wires, and when a story was to be updated they would type at a production terminal to create a Ceefax page. Then they had to produce a yard-long punched tape before running down two flights of stairs to the BBC's Central Apparatus Room and load into a reader which actually transmitted the pages. After returning to the news room they checked for mistakes. If, at that point, a spelling mistake was found the journalist had to go through the whole process again. Viewers can check Ceefax itself during the evening to see a special graphics countdown on page 100. Meanwhile BBC weather presenters will pay tribute to the service by using Ceefax-type pixelated maps on the forecasts. The Plain English campaign also paid tribute to the service with a lifetime achievement award recognising its commitment to communicating information to viewers as quickly and clearly as possible. Responding to the accolade Steve Herrmann, editor of the BBC News website, said: 'It is an honour for us to receive this lifetime achievement award, and it stands as a tribute to all the journalists who have worked on the service over the years, and the care they have taken in writing every story.' Former prime minister Sir John Major, who has previously told how he checked Ceefax pages to keep up to date with cricket scores between Downing Street meetings said the service will be 'much missed'.

Battered: Mugger Eric Banton, 49, attacked grandmother Lynne Elmer-Laird just to steal £20 to feed his drug habit . A 'high as a kite' heroin addict who shoved a vulnerable 91-year-old to the ground  just to steal £20 to fund his drug habit was jailed for 11 years today. Lynne Elmer-Laird, who suffered a broken arm, severe bruising all over her body and a blood clot on the brain when she was attacked in broad daylight by Eric Banton, 49, was at Wood Green Crown Court to see her attacker sent to prison. Crack cocaine and heroin fiend Banton has a string of 39 convictions for robbery, shoplifting, violence, dishonesty and drugs offences dating back to 1979. He has been sentenced twice for robberies, each for three years, and he breached two suspended sentence orders by attacking his victim. Keith Stones, defending Banton, said his client had committed a 'ghastly offence'. 'The day before this offence he was given a suspended sentence of four months,' he said. At the very time of the attack Banton was supposed to be attending a meeting with a parole officer, but he said he could not make it because he was with his sick daughter. In fact, he was robbing Mrs Elmer-Laird. Mr Stones said: 'The simple answer is, to use a vernacular, he was as high as a kite.' The lawyer said his client was remorseful, and although his sobs from the dock could be considered 'crocodile tears', Banton was genuinely sorry and had reached 'rock bottom'. Sick: Eric Banton should have been with his . probation officer but instead shoved and attacked the pensioner - . leaving her with devastating injuries including a blood clot on the . brain . Passing sentence, Judge James Patrick said Banton lived a life of 'entrenched offending'. Brave: Lynne Elmer-Laird came to court to see Banton sentenced and is determined to get her confidence back after the dreadful incident . Referring to him avoiding being sent to jail the day before the attack, he told him: 'You celebrated your good fortune with a binge of drink and drugs.' Turning to the robbery, he said he did not accept that Banton had 'dipped' his hand into Mrs Elmer-Laird's handbag, but that he 'deliberately and forcefully' grabbed it. 'She is determined to gain her confidence back,' he said. 'What you did to her must have devastated not only her but her family and friends. 'You are unable to live in society.' The judge told Banton he was not enacting the existing suspended sentence orders, but he must serve six-and-a-half years of his 11-year sentence behind bars, with the remaining four-and-a-half years on licence. Pc Paul Hallas, the investigating officer, said: 'Eric Banton deliberately targeted an elderly woman who, despite being frail from a fall, valued her independence enough to continue to shop and visit places in the local area. 'He left her on the ground with significant injuries and is lucky she had the resilience to pull through or he could have faced far mores serious charges. 'Banton hoped to get away with his crime and it was only through CCTV images released through media appeals that he was identified, subsequently arrested and charged. 'Mrs Elmer-Laird has shown tremendous bravery and courage through this ordeal and I hope these strengths will enable her to continue with her full and active life.' Keeping calm and carrying on: Inspirational Mrs Elmer-Laird was desperate to be in court to see the attacker jailed and is rebuilding her life after being attacked in the street .

"By . Matt Chorley and Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 03:53 EST, 23 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:06 EST, 24 October 2012 . The controversial badger cull was postponed at the eleventh hour yesterday after ministers said there were too many of the animals for two pilot schemes to be carried out effectively. The Government was accused of ‘shambolic’ planning for announcing that the culls would have to be put off until next year, days before they were due to start. The decision came after a survey showed badger numbers were twice as high as expected in the two pilot areas. With too few trained marksmen, it would be difficult to meet targets to kill enough badgers to reduce tuberculosis in cattle. Scroll down for video . A badger cull in Gloucestershire and Somerset was due to start imminently . As well as the problems over badger numbers, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson also blamed the wet summer, legal challenges by animal charities and a police request to wait until after the Olympics for delaying the pilot culls so that they could not be carried out during the ‘open season’ which runs until the end of January. Government advisers say 70 per cent of badgers in each of the pilot cull areas must be killed within six weeks to reduce disease. Otherwise, it could actually exacerbate the problem because badgers would flee the cull area and spread TB further afield. Farmers, who back the cull in the hope it will reduce TB in cattle which has devastated the dairy industry, were assured by Mr Paterson that it will go ahead next June. He insisted it was not a U-turn and that he was ‘utterly convinced’ a cull would help tackle the disease which killed 26,000 cattle last year and has cost the taxpayer £500million. A Government-commissioned study of badger culls in the 1990s showed a 16 per cent decrease in bovine TB in nine years. But campaigners who claim shooting thousands of the much-loved animals would not reduce TB and could make it worse were celebrating the stay of execution. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is to give a statement to MPs today in which he is expected to say the badger cull will still go ahead, but not until next year. Queen guitarist Brian May (right) has led a campaign opposing the cull . The issue has provoked strong passions . with animal rights activists threatening to disrupt the shootings, and . 150,000 people signing a petition against the policy. Animal lovers say . many healthy badgers will be killed. The cull was finally plunged in doubt . last week after farmers’ estimates of 2,000 badgers in each pilot area . in the South-West were found to be wide of the mark. Natural England, which is handing out . the cull licences, became concerned last month and commissioned a . recount, which found 3,500 in Gloucestershire and 4,300 in West . Somerset. Mr Paterson told MPs: ‘Despite a . greatly increased effort over the last few days and weeks, the farmers . delivering this policy have concluded that they cannot be confident that . it will be possible to remove enough badgers based on these higher . numbers and considering the lateness of the season. The decision to order a cull has attracted emotional protests and legal challenges . ‘Having looked at all the evidence . over many years, I am utterly convinced that badger control is the right . thing to do. I remain fully committed to ensuring the pilot culls can . be delivered effectively, safely and humanely next summer.’ NFU president Peter Kendall said the . higher numbers left farmers with a ‘huge challenge’ to meet the targets . for disease control and ‘reluctantly’ it had been decided to delay. Labour’s environment spokesman Mary Creagh said: ‘The Government’s handling of the cull has been incompetent and shambolic.’ She added that a cull ‘would cost . farmers more than it saved them, put a huge strain on the police, and . spread bovine TB in the short term as badgers move out of cull areas’. And scientist Lord Krebs, who devised the trial cull in the 1990s said the Government needed ‘rethink its strategy’ and that culling would have only ‘limited effect’. Dairy farmer David Horton from South Devon, who said his own herd had . been hit by TB, described the delay as a ‘disaster’ for the industry. He said: ‘We have been waiting to see . some action and now we have had this action postponed and everyone will . be devastated.’ James Small, 37, who owns 1,000-acre Warren Farm near . Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, said: ‘As a livestock farmer I am very . disappointed that we have a delay in trying to make a start on tackling . the disease.’ The father of two, who owns 177 cows . and lost two animals to TB this year, added: ‘This won’t be solved in . one or two years, it will take about 15 years, but every time we delay . now, it will add on more and more years at the back end. ‘The disease is spreading across the country now.’","Government ordered cull in Somerset and Gloucestershire to tackle TB in cattle herds .

A Premier League football referee accused of racially abusing a black Chelsea will be sacked if found guilty, a former top official said today. Mark Clattenburg is being formally investigated by the Football Association over the claims he hurled a racist insult at Chelsea star Obi Mikel when he was showed him a yellow card him in the 76th minute of yesterday's match against Manchester United. He is also said to have called a Chelsea player a 'Spanish t**t' during the heated encounter. Today former referee Graham Poll said Clattenburg would be worried if he made the comments because his career would be over. The sensational accusations come just one month after Chelsea captain John Terry was found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing opponent Anton Ferdinand.. Scroll down for video . Mikel John Obi of Chelsea and referee Mark Clattenburg are caught in a confrontation as Juan Mata of Chelsea looks on . Referee Mark Clattenburg pictured leaving his home this morning as the racism storm continues to grow . Former England captain Terry was . acquitted in a criminal case over the incident, which occurred during a Premier League game in October last year, but later stepped down from the top . position in English football. One of Chelsea’s Spanish stars is also involved in the racism row, after players claim they heard Clattenburg refer to him as ‘a Spanish t**t’. Spaniards Fernando Torres, Juan Mata . and Cesar Azpilicueta all played against United in the tense 3-2 defeat, . which saw Chelsea drop to nine men. Chelsea made an official complaint to the match delegate, whose report today appeared to have been passed to the FA. Clattenberg will not officiate in any games this weekend because his presence would be a distraction, the Professional Game Match Officials Board said. A statement from English football's governing body read: 'The FA has begun an investigation relating to allegations made following Sunday's fixture at Stamford Bridge between Chelsea and Manchester United. 'The FA will make no further comment at this time.' Accused: Clattenburg is alleged to have racially abused John Obi Mikel (right) during Chelsea's defeat . Dispute: Mikel complains to Clattenburg as his side slump to defeat at Stamford Bridge . Now the FA is set to demand footage . of the alleged incidents from broadcaster Sky ahead of a possible . disciplinary committee hearing. It is yet to launch a full . investigation. But . the controversy wasn't confined to the pitch, after shameful scenes saw . a steward taken to hospital after surging crowds crushed . him against a barrier at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground. The shameful incident happened as . Manchester United players celebrated a goal in front of Chelsea fans, . who rushed forward in reaction. The steward was carried away in a stretcher and taken to hospital where he was treated for a knee injury. Players . also collected a shocking number of coins hurled at them during the . game, along with a piece of seating which narrowly missed United players . Javier Hernandez and Ashley Young as they celebrated near an away stand. The club now faces both an FA and a police investigation into the incidents. After the match Clattenburg was confronted  in the referee’s room by Mikel along with his team's chief executive Ron Gourlay  and manager Roberto Di Matteo demanding an apology. But the referee refused to . apologise and at 7.45pm last night Chelsea decided to take the . incredible action of launching an immediate complaint to the Premier . League over his language. As Manchester United's Javier Hernandez celebrates his goal with Ashley Young a steward can be seen being crushed against a barrier, left, while a piece of seating is thrown from the crowd, right . Moments later the steward is pulled over the barrier and helped by a fellow steward . The injured steward is stretchered off the pitch and taken to hospital with a damaged knee . According to sources close to the players, they are willing to make statements to the FA’s disciplinary committee this week. A . club spokesman said: ‘We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League . match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the . referee and directed at two of our players in two separate incidents in . today’s match. The match delegate will pass the complaint to the FA.’ The . matter is now in the hands of the FA and Premier League officials, who . will ask Sky TV for footage from the 20 camera angles used for live . matches. While not all are recorded, they should help confirm whether Clattenburg made an inappropriate or racially aggravated comment. Premier League referees also wear . microphones, which suggests evidence by Michael McDonough and Simon Long . — who ran the line — or fourth official Michael Jones could be crucial. Feelings towards Clattenburg were already running high before the game had ended and the allegations had even emerged. The referee was heavily criticised for a series of decisions throughout the game which included allowing a Manchester United goal many considered to be off-side and wrongly sending off Chelsea player Branislav Ivanovic. A FIFA and Barclays Premier League referee, he is expected to be put forward to be the English representation at the 2014 World Cup after taking charge of the Olympic men's football final between Brazil and Mexico at Wembley this year. Stewards collect dozens of pounds and a piece of seating, all of which were thrown onto the pitch . Tough time: Clattenburg was given a hostile reception by the Chelsea fans as he left the field . The incidents occurred on the day Chelsea threw support behind the Kick Racism Out of Football campaign. Players . from Chelsea and United — with the exception of United’s Ashley Young — . wore One Game One Community T-shirts in the warm-up. John Terry, serving a four-match ban for . racially insulting Anton Ferdinand last October, wore a Kick It Out . badge as he watched from the sidelines. Rio Ferdinand, fined £45,000 for his ‘choc ice’ tweet, also ended his feud with Ashley Cole when they shook hands before the game. But all that was forgotten amid dramatic scenes nearly two hours after the final whistle. Winner: Javier Hernandez scores Manchester United's third goal . Home players heard the alleged comment to Mikel and will back up his story. Clattenburg said he would  co-operate with any inquiry. Professional Game Match Officials, the body which represents Premier League referees, released a statement which read: ‘PGMO is aware of the allegations and they are being treated with the utmost seriousness. Mark will co-operate fully and welcomes the opportunity for the facts to be established.’ Last month John Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 by the Football Association who found him guilty of racial abuse during a Premier League clash at QPR’s Loftus Road.The 31-year-old Chelsea captain had denied an FA charge that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand in a Premier League match last October and was acquitted in a criminal case in July.It brought to an end 11 months of controversy surrounding the confrontation with the QPR player, who Terry was accused of calling a ""f****** black c***’. In August 2009 Clattenburg was suspended following allegations he owed £60,000 as a result of a failed venture. He pulled out of a key match as a result and was later sacked by the Professional Game Match Officials board. The following year he was reinstated as a Select Group Referee on appeal, but just months later he was handed a suspension after being accused of sending threatening emails to business associates. In 2009 the referee enraged Manchester City staff after he turned to them and said ‘How do you put up with him?’ after sending off player Craig Bellamy, sparking concerns over his impartiality In 2005 he was the referee who failed to spot Pedro Mendes’s ‘ghost goal’ at Old Trafford for Tottenham.In 2007 he sent off Everton player Tony Hibbert, apparently upgrading his yellow card to red after consulting with Liverpool player Steven Gerrard. It was five years later that he was next allowed to rule over an Everton game.","Referee Clattenburg facing investigation for allegedly abusing two players during heated match between Chelsea and Manchester United .

Flames ripped through a garment factory in Karachi, killing 289 people. Hours earlier, a fire killed at least 25 workers in a shoe factory in Lahore. Last night it was claimed in Pakistan that the factory in Karachi supplied clothes to Selfridges and other shops in the UK. A relative of one of the owners of the factories said many other clothes made there ended up in the UK. Blaze: Firefighters extinguish flames at the garment factory in Karachi . Rescue: The fire crews attempt to save workers within the Karachi factory . Grief: A woman mourns the loss of at least one relative outside the Karachi factory . The factory is about 3000 square yards which had four main gates. Three of which were closed after a theft in the factory. All the four owners of the factory are still at large. The items of the company were also exported to states of Northern America. Many women and children were thought to be among the dead in Karachi, where a lot of the victims were burned alive. Others suffocated in the four-storey building, which had metal grilles on many of the windows. Workers have revealed how they jumped . from third floor windows to escape the blaze at a garment factory in . Karachi, where many victims were trapped in a basement. In Lahore, staff at a shoe factory claimed a faulty generator sparked the fire. 'We saw our colleagues burning alive, . in flames,' said Shabdir Hussain, from his hospital bed. 'We could do . nothing. We saved our lives by jumping from the roof.' Firefighters were still trying to subdue the blaze in Karachi yesterday morning, as hospital staff revealed its morgue was full with 'around 30 bodies burnt beyond recognition all lined up'. 'People started screaming for their . lives,' said factory worker Mohammad Asif, 20. 'Everyone came to the window. I jumped . from the third floor.' Another worker, Liaqat Hussain, 29, spoke from his hospital bed where he was being treated for burns all over his body. He said: 'Within two minutes there was fire in . the entire factory. 'The gate was closed. There was no access to get out, we were trapped inside.' Doomed: Firefighters remove the body of one of the trapped Karachi workers . Surveying the scene: Locals gather to witness the last of the flames being dealt with in Karachi . Fire chief Ehtisham-ud-Din said . most of the garment factory deaths were caused by suffocation as people . caught in the basement were unable to escape. Senior Superintendent of Police Amir . Farooqi revealed that police were raiding parts of Karachi to search . for the owners of the factory, which employed around 450 people. Smoke was still rising from the garment . factory as rescue workers pulled out charred corpses and covered them in . white sheets. Weeping relatives of workers stood around in the street awaiting . word of their fate. At least 35 people were injured. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The death toll from the late Tuesday fires is likely to raise fresh questions about industrial safety in the South Asian nation and draw more criticism of the deeply unpopular government. Gruesome task: Medical staff try to identify the bodies of the deceased taken from the Karachi garment factory . Crowds: A group watches on as firefighters deal with the blaze at a shoe factory in Lahore . Critics say Pakistan's government is too corrupt and ineffective to focus on the welfare of workers and a dizzying array of other problems, from crippling power cuts, to widespread poverty to a Taliban insurgency. Successive governments have been unable to provide a reliable power supply so factories have to have their own generators, powered by diesel or petrol, if they want to avoid regular, lengthy power cuts.

Coronation Street star Bill Roache has claimed to have slept with 1,000 women. The 79-year-old actor, who plays Ken Barlow in the soap, admitted: ‘I didn’t have any control over my sex drive.’ On screen Mr Roache, who is the only original cast member, has had four wives and 28 flings since the programme began in 1960. But off screen, as well as two wives, he has had countless flings and affairs and admitted that he regularly cheated on his first wife. Some of his lovers have referred to him in bed by his character’s name, Ken, and he was nicknamed C*** Roache by some of his castmates because of his insatiable appetite. He said that the women he has slept with include co-star Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner, with whom he had a one-night stand. The pair got together after he went around to her flat for some drinks, but they fell out after a row during filming. Pat, who died in 1986, didn't talk to him for years afterwards. 'It was just a one-off,' Mr Roache revealed. 'It was just something that happened one night when we were together. We weren't right for each other. She invited me round to her flat and we had a few drinks, then one thing led to another. 'At that time, she had a reputation, and she felt we should meet, as it were. It just happened.' But Mr Roache, who was speaking on Piers Morgan's Life Stories, said his womanizing left him feeling empty and depressed. 'I regret it deeply,' he said. 'I had the opportunity, but that . doesn’t mean I should do it. I had rehearsals up in Manchester from . Monday to Friday. The opportunity was there. 'There were plenty of girls around. I . shouldn’t have done it. I didn’t have any control over my own sex . drive. I didn’t have the strength to control it. Romance: Roache also admitted having a brief romantic relationship with Pat Phoenix, who played Elsie Tanner in the ITV soap . One night stand: Mr Roache pictured with Pat Pheonix, as Elsie Tanner, and Peter Adamson, as Len Fairclough, on the set of Coronation Street . 'It depressed me. I’m so sorry for . the things that I did. The hurt was the children. I’ll always regret . that. Every morning I woke up regretting and hurting.” He added: ‘Looking back, I didn’t know . any better. But what I did find out is it does not bring you happiness . and it is not the way to be. ‘I . had the opportunity, I indulged it and I can tell you this: it’s not . worth it - the pain that it caused, and there’s all sorts of dangers. ‘To love somebody and to make love to somebody that you love is the most beautiful thing in the world.’ Putting on a front: Bill in 1968 with two of his children, Vanya and Linus, and his first wife, actress Anna Cropper, who admitted to cheating on several times . Love of his life: Bill with his second wife Sara, who died in 2009 in her sleep, who he says he did not cheat on after learning the error of his ways . Mr . Roache said that he turned to drink after his first wife, Anna Cropper, . left him when she discovered his infidelity. His second wife, Sara, . died in her sleep in 2009. But he insisted: I didn’t have a problem. I could drink gin and tonic, I’d be there until 3 or 4 in the morning. I could get through half a bottle a day. 'I could give it up. I got terrible hangovers. I knew I didn’t have a drink problem, I just drank heavily.' The . father-of-four said he had stopped his womanising ways by the time he . had met Sara because he was fed up with it and she knew about his . previous behaviour. New love: Roache with his girlfriend, blonde TV weathergirl Emma Jesson . He has a son and a daughter from his first marriage and another son and a daughter with Sara. They had another child, Edwina, who died at just 18 months old. Mr Roache said the tragedy brought him and Sara closer together. He was left shocked and devastated after Sara's death. 'We were in bed one night and she just died, no big heart attack or stroke, she just died in my arms. 'It took us nine months to work out her cause of death, and her body stopped producing the chemical to make it beat. 'She . did everything for me and the children, she kept us all together and we . had to pick ourselves up and carry on. It was a very difficult time.' Screen romances: Ken with Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride) on their wedding day on Coronation Street . Back in the day: Ken pictured visiting a . pregnant Denise Osbourne (Denise Black) in hospital in a scene from 1994 . Mr Roache has been dating his current girlfriend, TV weathergirl Emma Jesson, for more than a year. He said: 'There was an instant connection between us. We were immediately comfortable in each other's company and we had good chemistry. So the friendship just progressed from there.' The . actor, who turns 80 next month, said he plans never to retire. ‘Retiring is not an option. While I can do it and they still want . me. I’ll be there.’ In 1991, Mr Roache sued The Sun for  branding him ‘Boring Ken Barlow’ – a case he won. He won damages of £50,000, the same amount the paper had offered to settle out of court. Because . of that, by the rules of libel, Mr Roache was responsible for his own . £120,000 court costs.

Human stem cells can be genetically engineered into 'warrior' cells that fight HIV - and the new cells can attack HIV-infected cells inside a living creature. The breakthrough, by UCLA scientists, is hoped to be the first step towards a treatment that can eradicate HIV from an infected patient. Much HIV research focuses on vaccines or drugs that slow the virus's progress - but this new technique could offer hope of a 'cure'. HIV virus: The UCLA researchers found that genetically engineered stem cells can attack infected cells within human tissue . Budding of HIV virus from cell tissue: The new trial tested genetically engineered 'fighter' cells in 'humanised' mice - mice with human tissue . The study, published April 12 in the . journal PLoS Pathogens, demonstrates for the first time that engineering . stem cells to form immune cells that target HIV is effective in . suppressing the virus in living tissues. 'We believe that this study lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals, in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body,' said lead researcher Scott G Kitchen. The scientists took CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes — the 'killer' T cells that help fight infection — from an HIV-infected individual and identified the molecule which guides the T cell in recognizing and killing HIV-infected cells. However, these T cells, while able to destroy HIV-infected cells, do not exist in great enough quantities to clear the virus from the body. So the researchers cloned the receptor and used this to genetically engineer human blood stem cells. They then placed the engineered stem cells into human thymus tissue that had been implanted in mice, allowing them to study the reaction in a living organism. Current medical treatments use antiretroviral drugs to slow HIV's progress. Daily ration of a person sick from HIV . The engineered stem cells developed into a large population of mature, multi-functional HIV-specific cells that could specifically target cells containing HIV proteins. The researchers also discovered that HIV-specific T cell receptors have to be matched to an individual in much the same way an organ is matched to a transplant patient. In this current study, the researchers similarly engineered human blood stem cells and found that they can form mature T cells that can attack HIV in tissues where the virus resides and replicates. They did so by using a surrogate model, the humanized mouse, in which HIV infection closely resembles the disease and its progression in humans. In a series of tests on the mice's peripheral blood, plasma and organs conducted two weeks and six weeks after introducing the engineered cells, the researchers found that the number of CD4 ""helper"" T cells — which become depleted as a result of HIV infection — increased, while levels of HIV in the blood decreased. 'We believe that this is the first step in developing a more aggressive approach in correcting the defects in the human T cell responses that allow HIV to persist in infected people,' Kitchen said.","Genetically engineered cells 'hunt' HIV within living tissue .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 25 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 25 August 2012 . More Britons than ever suffer from long-term skin conditions – the most common being acne, rosacea, eczema and seborrheic dermatitis, and sometimes all four at the same time. While not life-threatening in themselves, the psychological damage can be underestimated. Last week, it was reported that Vicky Norfolk, 31, took her own life after developing rosacea – a vascular condition that causes facial flushing and spots. Yet many doctors still view these  as minor complaints, which can make getting suitable treatment a challenge. Acne, commonly associated with teenagers, is on the rise among adults –  12 per cent of women and three per cent of men over 25 have the condition. Actress Cameron Diaz, 39, has learned how to best manage her outbreaks of adult acne, right . Celebrity sufferers include Hollywood actress Cameron Diaz, 39, Victoria Beckham, 38, and Katy Perry, 27, who skilfully disguise the outbreaks. But in most cases, there are effective ways to manage if not cure symptoms. Here, Dr Nick Lowe, director of the Cranley Clinic for Dermatology in London, Dr Adam Friedmann, a consultant dermatologist at The Whittington Hospital, North London, and cosmetic dermatologist Dr Samantha Bunting, who runs a clinic on Harley Street, explain the best options available. Acne occurs when glands in the skin produce too much of an oily substance called sebum. This blocks hair follicles, encouraging bacteria to grow, leading to infection. TREATMENT: DermaSweep. HOW IT WORKS: DermaSweep microdermabrasion scrubs the  skin with a brush while sucking up dead skin cells. A treatment, such  as salicylic acid that helps to increase skin cell turnover, can be applied simultaneously, ensuring it penetrates deep into the dermis. Suction  and pressure of brushes should be adjusted according to individual  needs and more force is applied with each treatment. DRAWBACKS: Must be tailored to individual needs and is not suitable for those with very inflamed acne. COST: £185 per session (four to six sessions needed), drnicklowe.com. TREATMENT Differin. HOW IT WORKS: Gel or cream contains a form of Vitamin A called adapalene. ‘Adapalene reduces the growth of surface . skin cells that can block pores and helps unblock pores and sebaceous . glands,’ says Dr Lowe. ‘This reduces the formation of blackheads and spots.’ DRAWBACKS: Increases skin’s sensitivity to sunlight. Very drying, so moisturisers must be used. COST: On NHS prescription; and on private prescription from £15. TREATMENT: Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion. HOW IT WORKS: ‘This contains very few ingredients, which means it’s less likely to  cause a reaction than other moisturisers,’ says  Dr Bunting. ‘Many people who suffer with acne  think they do not need a moisturiser but often their skin is dehydrated and a non-pore-blocking one such as this is ideal.’ DRAWBACKS: May not be emollient enough for those with severe eczema. COST: £7.85 (236ml), pharmacy2u.co.uk. Cetaphil and Aveeno Bath Powder are both recommended treatments for Eczema . The chronic condition of atopic eczema causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. The exact cause is unknown but it usually occurs in allergy sufferers. Most develop the condition in childhood although in more than half of cases, it clears up by 11 years old, and in 65 per cent by 16. Most sufferers are mildly affected but some have cracked, bleeding skin, prone to infection. TREATMENT: Aveeno Bath Powder. HOW IT WORKS: ‘It is really important to keep the skin moisturised in eczema patients and the main constituent of this cleanser is colloidal oatmeal, which helps maintain the skin’s natural barrier and pH levels,’ says Dr Lowe. ‘Oat proteins leave a protective barrier on the skin, which helps keep skin moisturised, too.’ DRAWBACKS: The smell of colloidal oatmeal can be offputting for some patients. COST: 10x50g sachets, £10.25, chemistdirect.co.uk. Sunlight Therapy is available on the NHS and helps boost Vitamin D levels . TREATMENT: Sunlight Therapy. HOW IT WORKS: ‘This can be very helpful for those with severe eczema,’ says Dr Friedmann. A recent study suggests Vitamin D may play a role. Vitamin D is linked to the production of a peptide or skin protein called cathelicidin, a substance that protects skin from viruses, bacteria and fungi. DRAWBACKS: Overexposure to sun can cause skin cancer. COST: Available on NHS; from £1,398 for a six-week private course, clearskin.uk.com . TREATMENT: Eumovate cream. HOW IT WORKS:  ‘This contains clobetasone butyrate, a type of topical steroid,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘It helps to break the itch-scratch cycle and should be used with an emollient [moisturiser] to help calm the inflamed patches of skin. I refer to this kind of cream as a “bad day” cream – you should use it only when really necessary and under medical supervision.’ DRAWBACKS: Only apply to the face if GP or dermatologist advises –  because it thins the skin and may cause hypersensitivity. COST: 15g, £6.39, boots.com. A form of eczema, caused by an overgrowth or sensitivity to a yeast called malessizia, seborrheic dermatitis is a common condition. It causes flaky, white scales and affects the head, particularly eyebrows, ears, scalp and chest. Those who suffer with eczema during childhood are more likely to develop it. TREATMENT: Protopic. HOW IT WORKS: ‘Also known as tacrolimus, this ointment is a topical immunomodulator that helps to suppress inflammation,’ says Dr Friedmann. ‘It behaves like a steroid but with none of the potential side effects such as thinning of the skin.’ DRAWBACKS: It can sting slightly. Use with a broad-spectrum sunscreen because it makes the skin more vulnerable to UV light. COST: £26.50 on private prescription. TREATMENT: Nizoral shampoo. HOW IT WORKS: ‘This contains ketoconazole, which is anti-fungal,’ says Dr Friedmann. ‘For those who suffer with the condition on their face, I advise they let the suds drip from the scalp onto the affected areas on the face and leave for two minutes.’ DRAWBACKS: Can dry hair out so use with conditioner. ‘Do not be tempted to use coal tar shampoos as an alternative,’ says Dr Lowe, ‘as they contain carcinogenic chemicals which are banned in the United States.’ COST: 60ml, £4.39, chemistdirect.co.uk. TREATMENT: Elidel. HOW IT WORKS: . ‘The active ingredient in this is pimecrolimus, a type of medicine . known as a skin-selective inflammatory cytokine inhibitor,’ says Dr . Bunting. ‘Put simply, this means that it helps reduce inflammation.’ DRAWBACKS: Works by suppressing the immune system and there is a concern that  long-term use may increase the risk of certain types of cancer. Patients should avoid strong UV light as  the medication can react, damaging the skin. Not to be  used during pregnancy. COST: On private prescription from £25. Affects one in ten Britons, causing flushing and, in serious cases, facial swelling. It may begin as a tendency to flush but can develop into long-lasting redness and spots. The exact cause is unknown but triggers may include genetics, blood-vessel abnormalities, bacteria and a mite that usually lives harmlessly on the skin. TREATMENT: Rozex Cream. HOW IT WORKS: ‘This contains the active ingredient metronidazole, which is an antibiotic,’ says Dr Friedmann. DRAWBACKS: Not yet tested on pregnant women so those planning pregnancy should avoid it. The only topical treatment known to be safe during pregnancy is erythromycin gel. COST: On NHS prescription; from £5.90 on private prescription. TREATMENT: Intense Pulsed Light (IPL). HOW IT WORKS: Red-thread veins soak up light energy from IPL, encouraging the body to reabsorb veins thus eliminating them. IPL also stimulates new collagen and strengthens small blood vessels. DRAWBACKS: ‘This is useful for those with broken capillaries but it must be administered by a qualified physician,’ says Dr Bunting. ‘Too high a burst of energy can cause permanent skin discolouration.’ COST: From £190 a session (five sessions needed), the-dermatology-centre.co.uk. Intense Pulsed Light, or IPL, is used to treat Rosacea as well as Roaccutane, available on prescription . TREATMENT: Roaccutane. HOW IT WORKS: ‘This drug contains isotretoinin, a form of Vitamin A, and was originally developed for acne but it can be used in low doses for rosacea, too,’ says Dr Friedmann. ‘There is a lot of scaremongering surrounding Roaccutane but under a dermatologist’s supervision you should have no problems, although it is usual to experience some form of eczema when you use it.’ DRAWBACKS: A last resort for sufferers and  it must be used under strict medical guidance. Skin becomes extremely dry and side effects include depression and temporary hair loss. COST: On NHS and private prescription from £25.50. by Dr Ellie Cannon .

Everyone is guilty of having a quick flick through their Facebook friends' holiday snaps from time to time. But according to a new study, the common idiom 'Keeping up with the Joneses', which refers to the comparison to one's neighbor as a benchmark for social caste, has been taken to a whole new level thanks to social media. To fail to 'Keep up with the Joneses' is perceived as demonstrating socio-economic or cultural inferiority and now it has been revealed that one in five Facebook and Twitter users admit they now constantly compare themselves to others based purely on the status updates, pictures and messages from their ‘friends’ on social media sites. More than half of 16-24 year olds admit they spend much of their time trying to measure up to the lives lived by others on Facebook - while more than one in ten 45-54 year olds do the same . The latest study by personal loans provider savviloans.co.uk, shows that ‘Keeping up with the Joneses’ is now a high-tech affair, with the constant stream of pictures and status updates of holidays, purchases, weddings, babies, new homes and other boasts leading to the rest of us questioning our own lifestyles. While these comparisons are hugely affecting the younger generation, with more than half of 16-24 year olds admitting they spend much of their time trying to measure up to the lives lived by others on Facebook, the phenomenon is not purely reserved for the young. A third of social media users between the ages of 25 and 44 admit they do it too, while more than one in ten 45-54 year olds do the same. The savviloans.co.uk survey carried out by Opinion Matters, also revealed that whilst one in five of us are increasingly spending more time in our own homes, the current economic climate has prevented a quarter of people from making those all-important home improvements that their house needs. Dr Sandra Scott, psychological Consultant: 'The rise of social networking means there are so many more ""Joneses"" to keep up with in today’s society. One of the most desired items people crave to keep up with their friends is a new car . 'We are all sharing more information about our lives with more people and can end up comparing ourselves to lifestyles projected by others through social media. 'We all have a tendency, to varying degrees, to be concerned about how other people view us and this can lead us to compare our lifestyles unfavourably to others who appear more affluent. 'The key is to keep perspective and to focus on the positives of who we are, and what we do have.' Almost 30 per cent of people say they feel envious of friends, family members, colleagues and neighbours who have more than them, over 40 per cent say they don’t like to think they’re missing out, while one in seven say they feel stressed about trying to keep up with others. The need to feel as though we’re having as much fun, and living a life which is just as exciting as our friends and families could have a financial impact for some careless spenders. Only 30 per cent say that the current economic environment has made them feel less pressure to measure up to the lives of others. Holiday . New Kitchen or bedroom . New car .

A mother-of-one has been unable to eat for four years after her pregnancy left her with a paralysed stomach. Charlene Johnstone developed gastroparesis when she fell pregnant with her son, Hayden, now three - and hasn't been able to eat since. The illness caused Charlene, 24, from Glasgow, to shrink from a healthy size 12 to a gaunt size 6 after being sick 15 times a day. Suffering: Charlene's weight plummeted and doctors originally thought she had pregnancy complications, before diagnosing her with gastroparesis after her son Hayden was born . Since her baby was born, Charlene has spent 14 hours a day attached to a drip, which she is fed through. Ms Johnstone said: 'I was initially told I was suffering complications from pregnancy. I had what I thought was severe morning sickness, lasting all day every day. 'It didn't go away after the first trimester, but I still thought it was pregnancy-related because I was fit and healthy before. I just thought I was unlucky. 'When I was officially diagnosed with stomach paralysis, I was told it could have been caused by the weight of the baby and the size of my miniscule bump. 'They thought I was having a small baby, so I went two weeks overdue and was induced, but when Hayden was born he was 10lb. 'Doctors thought he'd been sitting so internally and being so large he'd probably de-sensitised the nerve that supplies nerve function to the intestines.' Now out of hospital, Charlene is attached to a machine and drip fed 14 hours a day. Charlene with her mother Liz and her son Hayden. Her mother spoke to consultants and their MP to get funding for a 'stomach pacemaker' Struggle: Charlene, pictured in hospital, could eat for seven months after she was fitted with a pacemaker, but she has now developed intestinal failure, meaning she can't empty food . She said: 'I used to love chicken fajitas and homemade soup. I enjoyed chips with cheese and doner meat with salad cream. 'But because my stomach doesn't move, I don't get the empty feeling so I don't get hunger pangs anymore which is good.' When she discovered she was expecting, the former bouncer quit her job as the potential for injury was high. Charlene said: 'It turns out I didn't really have a choice, as I was in and out of hospital for the full nine months. 'I was so unwell that I found having a shower completely exhausting. I was advised to do as little as possible to allow my baby to develop.' At 42 weeks, Charlene gave birth to healthy baby boy, but after having Hayden her health rapidly began to deteriorate. Over the next few years baffled doctors explored everything. After being referred to a specialist she was diagnosed with severe gastroparesis. The condition reduces the ability of the stomach to empty its contents even though there is no blockage. The cause of it is unknown, but medics believe it could be triggered by a disruption of nerve signals to the stomach. She said: 'All I wanted was to go home and spend time with my baby but I wasn't well enough. 'I was so weak I couldn't even lift Hayden without collapsing and struggled to carry out his night feeds.' My little soldier: Charlene said her son Hayden kept her going . By March 2009 Charlene couldn't keep anything down, her weight plummeted to just five stone and she became dangerously ill. She was rushed to the high dependency unit and underwent three blood transfusions after suffering abdominal pain and coughing up blood. After seven months in hospital, her weight slowly crept back up and she was discharged. She said: 'My son was almost one and I had hardly been there, I felt so guilty.' Doctors even tried a highly experimental botox procedure, to try and relax the stomach muscles and allow food to move to the small intestine, but it didn't work. A temporary gastric pacemaker, in February 2010, proved successful and Charlene was eager for the permanent version. She said: 'It was heart-breaking to have the pacemaker removed after five days. My energy levels zapped back to zero and I was constantly vomiting again.' Although she was eligible for a permanent one, funding wasn't available. She said: 'The thought of another year like the last filled me with dread. The operation would cost £22,250. But my mum, Liz, 50, didn't give up and spoke to consultants and MPs until it was funded. I had it done in March 2010.' 'I was able to tolerate oral foods for almost eight months until my bowel failed. 'Intestinal failure is the final outcome. Nothing can be done at that stage, but with help from my consultant, Doctor Matthew Priest, at Gartnavel General Hospital, I can manage the symptoms.' 'My ward are so supportive and when I'm ill they help me fight to get better. They're like a second family. The ward is so busy they don't get enough praise for what they do. 'Hayden has been my wee soldier. There are times when I'm very poorly and I want to give up but then I think of what my wee granny said, 'If you ever feel like giving up, then think about why you held on so long in the first place' and that reason is Hayden.'","Doctors said Charlene's son may have de-sensitised the nerve that supplies nerve function to the intestines when he was in the womb .

A teenage girl who collapsed while she was taking a shower is thought to have died from an unknown electrical problem with her heart, an inquest heard. Amy Kirkby, 15, had no history of medical problems but after she was found unresponsive in the bath on September 2 last year and despite desperate efforts to save her, she was pronounced dead the same day. An inquest heard today that a pathologist’s post mortem results came back negative but that the most likely cause of the youngster’s death was an electrical conduction problem of the heart. The hearing was told how Amy’s mother Joanne had returned from work to their home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, around 4pm after being unable to contact her daughter. Her fears were allayed when she found her younger daughter Lucy there who told her mum that Amy was in the shower and that she had left a note. The short note was signed ‘Ames ‘and had a smiley face drawn on it. But it was when she went to check on Amy that her mother found her lying face down in the bath with the shower running. After calling for help her neighbour, retired teacher Falko Rech, came to her aid and began CPR until the ambulance crew arrived. Amy was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where she was pronounced dead less than 90 minutes after she was found in the bath. The most likely cause of death according to pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani was sudden cardiac death, possibly caused by an electrical conduction problem of the heart. He told Doncaster Coroner’s Court in evidence that the results of the post mortem on Amy were negative and he could find nothing wrong internally or with an X-ray. He did note some external blistering on the chin and upper chest, similar to a scald. Dr Al-Adnani told the court that the problem wouldn’t necessarily show up in a post mortem. Before he gave evidence the court heard that while on a camping trip a few days before her death Amy had complained of feeling dizzy on several occasions and had vomited once. 'One can only wonder if that was a possible sign, suggestion of an underlying heart problem,' said the pathologist. Amy was taken to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where she was pronounced dead less than 90 minutes after she was found in the bath . Dr Al-Adnani told the court that there could possibly have been a genetic abnormality but no way to tell for sure. He added that a person 'could be very healthy, live their life to the full and then suddenly drop dead'. Amy’s mother told the court that she had taken medication for an irregular heartbeat for about six months. Investigating police officer, Det Con Nichole Russell, said that according to her friends, in the week running up to her death Amy seemed 'happy, fit and well'. She concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances in the case. Coroner Nicola Mundy passed a verdict of natural causes and said that it was more likely than not that Amy’s was a sudden cardiac death. She said: 'I do believe that is really all we are left with. In cases such as these they are often caused by an electrical conduction problem and that would not be seen in an autopsy.' Miss Mundy told the court that while the dizziness and vomiting could be a sign of some cardiac problem, she also said it could be something completely different. She also advised Amy’s family that it would be prudent for family members to be genetically tested in the wake of the tragedy.","Pathologist says Amy suffered  sudden cardiac death, possibly caused by an electrical conduction problem of the heart ."

A mother who was told her baby daughter had died in the womb before doctors said she was alive but suffering from a dangerous blood-clot, is celebrating after taking her home. Shelagh McAlpine, 37, suffered a . placental abruption in April when she was 28 weeks’ pregnant - putting her and . her unborn daughter’s life in danger. Medics initially told Shelagh that she had lost her baby when she was rushed to hospital where doctors struggled to detect the unborn child’s heartbeat. Stephen, Shelagh and their daughter Mia Rose who recovered despite being three months premature and suffering from life-threatening blood clots . They then discovered she was alive but had a life-threatening blood clot in her arm and holes in her lung and heart. But after an emergency caesarean and several operations, little Mia Rose has now made a full recovery and gone home to her parents in Glasgow. Ms McAlpine said: 'She has been through so . much and has battled everything she’s come up against, now she is a . healthy wee baby. We feel so blessed to have her - she is our little . miracle.' Shelagh was rushed to the Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley, Renfrewshire on April 25 after she started bleeding heavily in the early hours of the morning. 'My due date was July 15 so I was . panicking and I thought I had lost my baby - it was terrifying and I was . completely distraught,' she said. 'My partner, Stephen, was working away . in London when it happened so I was in hospital alone, leaving my son, . Reece, who’s two, with family - but he had witnessed everything. 'Doctors couldn’t detect Mia Rose’s . heartbeat for about seven minutes - they were the longest seven minutes . of my life. When they found it I was so relieved, but still so scared . about what could happen. 'I was rushed in for an emergency . caesarean and my beautiful baby girl, Mia Rose, entered the world. She . needed ten blood transfusions, while I needed two.' Mia Rose was in hospital for three months. She lost the top of two fingers on her left hand and the tips of three other fingers . Delight: Doctors couldn't detect Mia's heartbeat for seven minutes, but the premature baby girl pulled through . Mia Rose weighed just 2lb 10oz when . she was born and was rushed straight to the special baby care unit. It . was five days until Shelagh was well enough to visit her. Stephen Storrie, 30, dashed up from London then followed his . daughter to Yorkhill Hospital where Mia underwent life-saving surgery to remove a . blood clot from her arm. Stephen said: 'I just sat in the car in . the car park for five hours while Mia Rose was in theatre. I didn’t tell . anyone what was happening. Shelagh was too ill and everyone was . shattered by what had already happened. 'I decided to wait until after the operation and prayed for good news.' Another blood clot was found further up her arm, but both were successfully removed. The next 72 hours were critical as Mia Rose could have lost her arm or foot - which had turned black due to a lack of oxygen. Happy family: Stephen and Shelagh McAlpine, with Reece and baby Mia Rose at home in Glasgow . Shelagh said: 'The next couple of weeks were touch and go with a few scares but Mia Rose kept pulling through.

A proposed airport in the Thames estuary would be in the 'very worst spot' for the south-east's crowded airspace, according to the boss of Britain's air traffic control service. Richard Deakin, chief executive of the National Air Traffic Services (Nats), said there were 'serious challenges' in working more planes into an already busy flight path. He added that the architects who unveiled . plans for the £50bn project last November had not even asked air . traffic control about the feasibility of the airport. 'The very worst spot': An artist's impression of how the 'Boris Island' airport in the Thames estuary could look . The stinging attack on plans for the 'floating' airport from Britain's most senior air traffic chief will add to growing calls it to be scrapped. Deakin said that the Thames estuary airport - dubbed the 'Boris Island' after London Mayor Boris Johnson - would be built under flight paths for four of London's five airports. These include Heathrow, Gatwick, Stanstead, Luton and London City. 'We're a little surprised that none of the architects thought it worthwhile to have a little chat,' Mr Deakin told the Guardian. The plans by architects Foster and Partners were revealed in January and would make the airport the biggest in Britain. Busy: The four-runway airport in the Thames would be capable of handling 150 million passengers a year, but there are concerns about airspace congestion . Mr Deakin said that the majority of flight paths criss-crossed the direct spot where the Estuary airport is planned. This would lead to more traffic jams in the air. Planes arriving and departing airports . must follow strict flight paths. If the skies are congested the planes . must circle before there is a slot in the sky. He added that in addition to the risk of planes being hit by birds in the wetands, there would also be competition for air space from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. More flights would then be forced to circle overhead for longer. Mr Deakin said that even though the Estuary airport was possible it would go against plans in the aviation industry to conserve fuel by shortening flight times. He called for a third runway to be built at Heathrow. 'The single biggest thing we could do to reduce CO2 in the UK is to build a third runway at Heathrow,' he said. 'Heathrow holding is not about airspace - it's about lack of tarmac. I'm very confident that (a third runway) would eliminate all the holding patterns in one go.' Vital: George Osborne has reportedly claimed that expansion of Heathrow Airport, pictured, is key to Britain's economic future . Controversial: The plans for a third runway have been met with constant strong opposition from local residents near the proposed site . The Coalition agreement signed between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in 2010 banned any extra airports. However, there is growing pressure from BAA, the flight industry and from Tory ministers for Britain to increase its air capacity. David Cameron has even signalled his intention to increase the number of flights coming in and out of the UK either by expanding Heathrow or building anew airport. One of the most likely options is the 'Boris Island'. The Government aviation review is currently looking at the project after George Osborne announced in the Budget that Britain needed to  ‘confront the lack of airport capacity’ in the South East of England. The £50billion airport would be built on an artificial island made of landfill and would be capable of handling 150 million passengers annually -  or 300,000 passengers a day - making it Britain’s main international hub. Having initalliy ruled out a third runway at Heathrow after opposition from locals and environmental groups, the Government is ‘increasingly interested’ in the idea. The scheme is expected to cost between £40billion and £70billion. The airport would have four runways, with space to build two more. Mayor of London Boris Johnson, left, is keen on plans for an airport in the Thames Estuary. Chancellor George Osborne has signalled a u-turn on a controversial third runway at Heathrow . Mr Johnson has also praised separate designs by architect Lord Foster for a £50billion airport on a sparse strip of land on the Isle of Grain in Kent, which juts out into the estuary. London Mayoral candidate Siobhan Benita today slammed Mr Johnson's 'fantasy island' and called for a third runway at Heathrow. She said: 'By blocking the runway, Boris Johnson is preventing the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in London and depriving our economy of billions of pounds. Surely this government’s U-turn on Heathrow has left Boris Johnson stranded on his fantasy island.' 'By the time a new airport is built, London will have lost out to another European city, like Madrid, Frankfurt or Paris and that would sound the death knell to Heathrow. That would be a devastating blow to jobs and the economy.' Environmental campaigners have criticised the plans for the damage they could do to rare wildlife in the estuary, as well as adding to Britain's CO2 emissions. The Government has meanwhile signalled that plans for a controversial third runway at Heathrow are 'back on the table'. The Chancellor has refused to rule out expanding Britain's biggest airport because he believes it is key to our 'hub status' and essential to Britain's economic future. Earlier this month a report suggested that the UK economy will suffer by up to £8.5billion per year over the next decade if Heathrow does not undergo significant expansion. A Department for Transport spokesman said: 'In the summer we will consult on an overarching sustainable framework for UK aviation and alongside this we will publish a call for evidence on maintaining effective UK hub airport connectivity. The coalition's position regarding Heathrow has not changed.'","Nats chief executive Richard Deakin says there are 'serious challenges' with Boris Island site .

Tara Darlington, 23, and her sister Pippa, 21, were remembered by their loved ones at a service held in a church in their home town of Whiteparish, near Salisbury in Wiltshire. The 'beautiful' sisters died last month . in a road accident near the city of Rabat as they were both due to enter . their final year of study at their respective universities. Scroll down for video . Pippa, 21, left and Tara, 23, right, who were killed in a car crash in Morocco. Their father Patrick said at their funeral today his daughters had 'made the world a better place to be in' Tragic: The coffins of the two sisters are carried out of the church as hundreds pay tribute to the 'beautiful' girls . Their father Patrick, 62, said his daughters had 'made the world a better place to be in'. Mr Darlington and his wife Emma, 52, arrived at the church near their home on foot. The girls also leave a 15-year-old brother, Oscar, who was supported by friends during the service. Hundreds of people packed into All Saints’ Church church to hear a number of moving tributes. Mr Darlington said: 'Our darlings, who would ever have thought that you would not return from Africa, that we would be mourning your loss and looking back at the wonderful girls that you were, rather than looking forwards, at all the possibilities that were opening up for you. 'Mummy and I are so very sorry. We have been cheated. It seems so unfair. We loved you so much. 'Each of you were the brightest of stars - burnt out in your prime.' During the service seven readings were given by friends and the girls’ godparents. The Rev Nils Bersweden gave the address and there was music including the songs All You Need is Love by the Beatles, Driving Along In My Automobile by Chuck Berry and Elgar’s Salut d’Amour performed on the cello by the girls’ friend Angus Reid. Devastated: Parents Emma and Patrick Darlington arrive at the funeral where Mr Darlington paid a moving tribute to his daughters, saying: 'Each of you were the brightest of stars - burnt out in your prime' Mourners gather outside All Saints' Church in the girls' home town of Whiteparish, near Salisbury in Wiltshire to pay their respects . Flowers are laid on the grass outside the church and the girls' parents Emma and Patrick can be seen walking behind their daughter's coffins . Mr Darlington, a former wine merchant and director of the Yellow Bike Company, said his family would mourn the loss of the girls for the rest of their lives, but that today they wanted to celebrate their lives. He described Tara as 'buzzing with energy, joy, fun and new ideas'. 'You (Tara) were strong and vibrant, like a little lioness,' Mr Darlington said. 'You were fiercely loyal, had a quick wit, and were full of love for the world and what it had to offer. We are so pleased you saw so much of the world.' He said his younger daughter Pippa was 'soft, kind, beautiful, sensitive, loyal and incredibly loving'. 'Pippa loved to travel, meet different people and learn their ways,' he added. Friends and family of the girls weep at the funeral of the sisters who were about to enter into their final year at their respective universities . 'She loved the sun and being by the sea collecting shells. Tall, elegant, willowy, with a gracious swan-like neck and perfect hour glass figure, Pippi had wonderful eyes - you could look right into her soul.' He ended the tribute saying his daughters would have been 'amazed' by how many people had attended the service. 'It is clear that they touched many,' he said. 'We were very lucky to have two such golden girls.' The two wooden coffins adorned with flowers were carried from the church by their friends before they were placed into a hearse side by side. The sisters were driving home on September 17 with their friend Joshua Stump, 21, from Salisbury, who was seriously injured in the crash. Tara was studying media, journalism and sociology at Goldsmiths University in south east London, while her younger sister studied law at Newcastle University. Their rented car collided with another vehicle on the same road where Tara’s godfather, David Windmill, said there had been 25 other deaths in the two previous weeks. 'Each other's soulmates': Tara and Pippa were the best of friends . Mr Windmill, 63, from Edinburgh, said the sisters were both well-travelled and had been to Australia and Europe, and Tara had also been to America, but they were drawn to Morocco and Africa as part of 'taking on the world'. 'This was another part of them exploring life,' Mr Windmill said. 'Nobody would want this to happen. It was just one of those very very tragic accidents, I have to say in a country which does have a huge number of road accidents. 'I think people should go and explore and should go and look at different cultures but, for example, in the two weeks before they died 25 people had been killed on that piece of road in Morocco, so if there is one lesson there, it is just to be aware.' He added: 'The initial shock was obviously awful. The suddenness of it all was just terrible. 'But what’s really impressed me is the way the village and the way Tara’s friends have come around (to the house) just allowing the family to grieve but grieve in a positive way.' The sisters had been keeping in touch with their family and friends using their mobiles. A friends told the service that one of the last texts Tara and Pippa had sent him said they were about to go horse riding on the beach at sunset and that this was how he was going to remember them. Follow the service the family said in a statement: 'We are so grateful for the amazing support, generosity and kindness everyone has shown us.

Up to 50,000 jobs could be lost in Britain if the country’s biggest defence company joins forces with its Franco-German rival, a report warns today. Many of the cutbacks will come in firms that supply BAE with parts – but thousands of workers directly employed by it could also be under threat. The acknowledgement that the merger would lead to widespread job losses comes amid growing opposition to the deal. Made in Britain: Typhoons under construction at BAE Systems, Warton Aerodrome, Lancashire . It is mired in controversy over how much control the French and German governments will enjoy over the new company. Berlin is threatening to block the deal unless it has its headquarters in Munich. However, last night Defence Secretary . Philip Hammond said the Government here is also prepared to intervene – . if the deal threatens the UK’s national interest. He said the Coalition would tolerate some French and German control of the company but their shares should be limited. Prepared to intervene: British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . And he said Britain would insist on the defence arm of the new company being ‘headquartered in the UK’. He added: ‘We have made very clear that we do have red lines and that if they can’t be satisfied then we will use our special share to veto the deal. ‘But it’s not, I think, necessary to have no French or German government interest in the company; it is necessary to reduce that stake below the level at which it can direct the way the company acts. We want to see this company, and I think the management wants to see this company, prospering as a commercial business, focused on doing the things that are right for the business, not being beholden to or controlled by any one.’ Downing Street has sought to suggest that David Cameron will seek a guarantee that British jobs would be preserved. But a well-placed source in the Ministry of Defence has told the Mail that this will not be possible.‘Jobs will certainly go in the short and medium term,’ the source said. ‘There’s nothing we can do about that.’ A report by financial health specialists Company Watch said the merger threatens the future of 7,500 BAE suppliers in the UK with 52,000 staff. That is on top of the 35,000 workers employed by BAE directly in Britain. Company Watch warned that firms that supply BAE could see contracts and job opportunities migrate to European companies already supplying EADS. BAE spends more than £4billion every year with its suppliers, from manufacturing giants such as Rolls-Royce to the cafes that make lunch for engineers. Nick Hood of Company Watch, said: ‘The merger may have the unexpected side effect of threatening not just supply companies and their employees, but the UK’s climb out of double dip recession. ‘This is no time to play with the fate of 7,500 UK suppliers and their 52,000 employees.’ The combined company would also be ‘significantly’ weaker financially than BAE, says the report, because EADS is not as strong. Ben Wallace: Leading the opposition to the deal . ‘BAE suppliers that manage to retain . their relationship with the merged operation will find themselves forced . to deal with a customer with a much less positive credit profile,’ said . the report. It also warned that suppliers could have to renegotiate their contracts on less favourable terms. MP . Ben Wallace, who is co-ordinating Tory opposition to the deal, said: . ‘It is obvious that small British businesses will be made vulnerable by . this decision. 'They haven’t even guaranteed the jobs at BAE.’ Mr Wallace sent a letter signed by 45 Tory MPs to David Cameron demanding Britain veto the deal unless the French and German governments sell their stakes in EADS. Both want shares of between 9 and 13 per cent in the new company. The Spanish government claims 5 per cent. That means the three European governments could control a key 25 per cent of the firm. ‘Why would they want to own it if they don’t want to manipulate it?,’ Mr Wallace said. BAE is also facing a revolt from its shareholders. Two of the ten biggest say BAE has failed to tell them what is going on.

Six years after political scandal led to them announcing their separation, this is the picture that shows everything  is back to normal for Labour’s Tessa Jowell and her husband  David Mills. The pair were seen laughing and joking as they emerged from Dame Tessa’s London home early in the morning after apparently spending the night under the same roof. An onlooker said: ‘Mr Mills came out first, and moved his car to by the front door so she could get in for a lift. They were both very jovial together, laughing and smiling. Together once more: David Mills and Dame Tessa Jowell emerge from her North London home last week. The couple appear to be back together six years after they separated . ‘It looked very much like he had slept there overnight.’ It comes a fortnight after Dame Tessa, 65, revealed that the pair, who have two grown-up children, had rekindled their romance. The MP for Dulwich, South East London, announced the split in 2006, amid growing claims in Italy that tax lawyer Mr Mills accepted a £350,000 bribe in return for providing false testimony for Silvio Berlusconi in two corruption trials targeting the then Italian premier. Split: Mr Mills is seen arriving with his wife at the couple's London home in 2006 shortly after allegations he took a £350,000 bribe from Silvio Berlusconi came to light . Dame Tessa had signed documents for a huge loan taken out on the marital £1million home in North London – only for the loan to be repaid shortly afterwards, allegedly with the ‘bribe’ money. She maintained she was unaware of the payment Mr Mills, 67, received from Mr Berlusconi, but the controversy called into question her position as Culture Secretary. It worsened when it emerged Mr Mills had used her Cabinet position, and their friendship with Tony Blair, the then Prime Minister, to try to fend off the corruption claims. An official Cabinet inquiry criticised Dame Tessa over her behaviour, but Mr Blair cleared her of wrongdoing. Mr Mills was first convicted in Italian courts of taking a bribe  from Berlusconi – then cleared on  a technicality. Although they sold their house following their split, with Mr Mills moving to Warwickshire and Dame Tessa to a flat in Highgate, they never divorced, and there had since been regular claims that the two were repeatedly seen together. But during an interview on Radio 4 show Woman’s Hour last month – days after her decision to step down from the Shadow Cabinet and not long after she received her damehood – she firmly denied that the separation had been a fraud designed to save her career. She said: ‘What mother is prepared to look her children in the eye and say, “We are splitting up. But, you know what? It’s not real”.’ Of their split, she added: ‘He reached the view that life was intolerable while we were together and, as he put it to me, “You’re my problem, I’m your problem” and we separated. It broke my heart.’ But revealing how there had been a rapprochement, she said: ‘David has his house in the country and I have my house. We see each other regularly and we have time together which I really treasure as a family. We have reached a state of stability which I never thought possible.’","Couple seen living Dame Tessa's London home last week .

Controversial: Bollywood star Sherlyn Chopra, 28, will be the first Indian woman to appear nude in Playboy . A Bollywood actress has been accused of shaming her country by becoming the first Indian woman to appear naked in Playboy. Sherlyn Chopra, 28, will star in the magazine's November issue after she wrote to Playboy asking to strip for them. Speaking to BBC Hindi, the actress admitted she found it a difficult challenge. The actress, who has played a number of roles in Bollywood films, said: 'It is not an easy task to be nude in front of the camera and look good at the same time.' Ms Chopra's appearance in the magazine is already proving controversial in India. Although Playboy is banned in the country, people can still get access to it from the internet. ‘She’s not hot, she’s repulsive,’ said one critic on Twitter. And some Indian columnists have . attacked Playboy’s billing of Miss Chopra as a ‘Bollywood legend’, . pointing out that she has had only minor roles. ‘At a time when innocent women across . the nation from Gujarat to Guwahati have been subjected to sexual abuse . and humiliation, one wonders if Sherlyn Chopra’s pictures wound a . woman’s integrity,’ said commentator Gayatri Sankar. Unabashed, Miss Chopra has hinted that her next step may be into sex films. She said India’s youth ‘is racing . towards liberalisation, and that’s why being unconventional in your . choices is no longer a taboo’. But despite the possibly difficulties she may face, Ms Chopra is proud of what she has done. 'I have become the first Indian to pose naked for Playboy and nobody can take away that achievement from me,' she said. 'My sister is proud of my achievement.'

The two cats circled each other before Freya went in with a claw to Larry's neck . After circling her opponent with what onlookers described as a ‘deathly stare’, the street’s feisty newcomer attacked. Larry attempted to put up a fight, but after Freya landed a paw on his neck he was forced to flee back to Number 10. Witnesses said that relations between the two cats have been strained since Freya usurped Larry from his role of prowling the corridors of power. Larry was appointed Chief Mouser to the Cabinet shortly after he was brought in to deal with the rodent problem on Downing Street in February last year. But his kill rate failed to meet . Government targets, and like his owner he became the subject of . accusations that he spent too much time ‘chillaxing’.

A 17-year-old boy who assaulted another teenager using the boy’s own crutches has been let off with a warning by the Crown Prosecution Service. Angus Whittall, 15, suffered multiple facial injuries after he was viciously attacked walking on a quiet country lane near his home in Great Oxendon, Northamptonshire. Despite identifying his attacker, who is known to the police, Angus and his family were told it was ‘not in the public interest’ to prosecute the 17-year-old. Hospitalised: Angus was on crutches following a knee surgery when the 17-year-old used them to beat him up, leaving him with horrific facial injuries . Angus needed 12 stitches for a gash in . his mouth and suffered severe bruising to his head and neck from the . unprovoked July attack. Police arrested the boy and charged . him with actual bodily harm, but weeks before he was due to appear in . court, the CPS refused to prosecute. Angus’ parents today slammed the decision, saying they had ‘lost faith in the justice system.’ Battered: Angus Whittall, 15, after the brutal attack . Company director Peter, 47, said: ‘I . don’t know how somebody known to police can cause such nasty injuries . and escape punishment. ‘We are appalled that this has been allowed to happen. ‘We were told it wasn’t in the public interest to haul him before the courts. It’s baffling.’ Angus . was on crutches, following a knee operation, when the boy attacked him . as he walked along a country lane on July 29 this year. Completely . unprovoked, the youth punched Angus before beating him around the head . with his crutches and then leaving him bleeding on the ground. Mr . Whittall, questioning both the CPS and the police, who took a month to . arrest the 17-year-old, said if the brutal attack 'isn't cause for legal . action - what is?’ He added: ‘We were told it wasn’t in the public interest to haul him before the courts. It’s baffling.’ Angus’ mother Cathy, 46, a recruitment consultant, fumed: ‘We were all so disappointed. ‘When my son heard that the yob had escaped with a slap on the wrists he just started shaking his head. ‘Now that his attacker has got away with it, he could easily do it again to someone else. ‘It was a completely unprovoked attack and there is nothing to stop him doing it again if he knows he will get away with it.’ Scene: Blood can be seen on the road in Great Oxenden where the assault took place in July this year . Police arrested the perpetrator from . Rothwell, Northamptonshire at the end of August and had been due to face . an assault charge in youth court at Kettering Magistrates on September . 7. Evidence: Angus' blood spattered trousers . However, when the CPS ruled they would not be seeking a prosecution and referred the case back to the police. Northamptonshire Police decided to give the teenager a slap on the wrist. A spokesman for CPS East Midlands said yesterday: ‘A senior crown prosecutor has reviewed all the facts in this case, including the aggravating and mitigating factors. ‘The circumstances behind this assault fit the national criteria for a final warning, which has now been formally administered by a police officer. ‘Reprimands and warnings are often used as a method of addressing the behaviour of young people with the intervention of the local youth offending team. ‘The views of the victim and his family have been taken into account in reaching this decision.' A Northamptonshire Police spokesman added: ‘Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, it was determined that he receive a final warning, rather than appear before the court.’","Angus Whittall, 15, was attacked on a country lane near his home in Great Oxendon, Northamptonshire .

Banned for life: Christopher Keogh has been jailed and can never keep a pet again after he brutally killed his Jack Russell . A man who beat his Jack Russell dog to death in a brutal attack has been jailed and banned from keeping pets for life. Christopher Keogh, 31, kicked, punched and slammed one-year-old Bambi against a brick wall before dumping the bloodied body in a bin. Animal rights protesters Colchester Animal Defenders demonstrated outside Colchester Magistrates’ Court protested yesterday, jeering Keogh as he entered. During the attack, neighbours called the police after hearing screams, which they reported was an animal or a child in distress. The father-of-two lost his temper with Bambi after it bit his three-month-old son on the hand, the court heard. In the rage that followed, he choked the dog by carrying it outside by its collar and throwing the dog above his head across the courtyard outside his home in Colchester. Keogh was jailed for 150 days and banned from keeping animals for life. The attack on September 26 this year lasted several minutes and was caught on CCTV which police have deemed too upsetting to release. Officers found Bambi’s body wrapped in a towel in a bin outside his flat complex. It was taken to a vet, who confirmed it was dead. Keogh was arrested shortly after. District Judge Andrew Woollard said: ‘I can’t envisage a crime more serious than what you committed. Court protest: Animal rights protesters jeered Keogh as he entered Colchester Magistrates' Court and held placards such as 'RIP BAMBI' and 'Justice for Bambi' ‘It appears in your fury you took the dog and executed it. ‘I suspect everyone else who hears the facts would find them disgusting. Custody it has to be.’ Judge Woollard refused his solicitor’s requests for Keogh to undergo a psychological . report before sentence was passed. Emma Bailey, mitigating, said: ‘He is genuinely remorseful and upset. The dog had bitten his very young baby. ‘When he saw the dog was injured, he took it inside and at this point becomes hysterical when he sees it is not moving. ‘He never wanted this to happen. The dog had been well loved up until this point.’ The court heard how Keogh had recently overcome a drug habit and was now taking replacement medicines twice a week to stave off addiction. Longer sentences: About 15 protesters from Colchester Animal Defenders protested outside court and banged on the court house windows as Keogh entered. They believe there should longer sentences for people convicted of animal cruelty . He is well known to the court with a history of other offences, although not for animal cruelty. Members . of the Colchester Animal Defenders protested outside court because they . want longer sentences for people convicted of animal cruelty offences. About 15 protesters jeered Keogh as he entered the court, held placards that read ‘Justice for Bambi’ and banged on the court house windows as he entered. Speaking after the decision, Liza . Moore, head of Colchester Animal Defenders, said: ‘This is nowhere near a . long enough sentence. ‘Barbaric animal killings such as this should be punished in the toughest possible way. ‘You shouldn’t get less for fraud and crimes that are less violent.’ Ms Moore is calling for residents to lobby their MPs to demand tougher sentences for people who abuse animals. She said: ‘There is no excuse for animal abuse. 'Disgusting': District Judge Andrew Woollard told Keogh at Colchester Magistrates' Court (pictured) that he couldn't 'envisage a crime more serious that what you committed' ‘There is a direct correlation between people who abuse animals and those who go on to hurt human beings.’ The campaign has been supported by Big Brother contestant and model, Victoria Eisermann, who was due to attend the protest but was unable to make it on the day. Keogh was prosecuted by Essex Police, but an RSPCA spokesman said he was glad the courts saw it as serious enough to hand Keogh a jail sentence and lifetime ban on keeping pets. The spokesman said: ‘This was a particularly nasty case. ‘Hopefully the fact he has received a lifetime ban on keeping animals will be more effective than his short spell in prison. ‘It is about the care and welfare of animals and if he doesn’t have access to them then there can be no more suffering at his hands.’","Christopher Keogh beat his Jack Russell dog to death .

A 21-year-old Kentucky woman has been charged with shooting to death her boyfriend in what her attorney calls an act of self-defense. Shayna Hubers, of Lexington, was arrested last week after allegedly gunning down 29-year-old Ryan Poston, a lawyer from Highland Heights, Ohio. At around 9pm on Friday, Hubers called 911 and told the dispatcher that she had shot Poston 15 minutes earlier, and that he had stopped breathing, according to a police report. Grave charge: Shayna Hubers, left, is accused of shooting to death her boyfriend, 29-year-old attorney Ryan Poston, right . Crime scene: Police say Hubers gunned down Poston inside his Highland Heights, Ohio, condominium . When officers responded to Poston's condo at 12 Meadow Lane a few minutes later, they discovered the 29-year-old dead from multiple gunshot wounds, Cincinnati.com reported. They also found a handgun on the scene which was identified as the weapon used in the shooting. Hubers stopped police while they were questioning her to tell them that she shot her boyfriend in the face and then fired again to put him out of his misery, according to the report. 'I’m not going to talk about the facts of the case, except to say that it is a self-defense case. The only thing she did wrong was having bad taste in men,' said defense attorney Wil Zevely. '...She is a very young and kind person. She would never do anything violent: never has, never would.' The attorney said his client and Poston had dated for at least a year. The victim’s family and friends described the relationship as 'tumultuous' and 'on-and-off.' Gristly: Hubers allegedly told police she shot her boyfriend in the face and then fired again to put him out of his misery . Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it . According to the 29-year-old's family, Poston was trying to break up with Hubers and 'move on with his life ' at the time of his death. 'Please keep in mind that the real victim in this tragedy is Ryan Poston, not the woman who shot him multiple times,' his family said in a statement cited by WKRC. 'Anyone who ever knew Ryan knows her claims of self-defense are absurd. We look forward to the day when the truth comes out in a court of law, not from the mouth of a criminal defense lawyer trying his case in the media.' Bold claim: Hubers' attorney said that the 21-year-old was never prone to violence and shot Poston in self-defense . Hubers appeared in court Tuesday morning via video from the Campbell County jail. No plea was entered, but a visiting judge reduced her bond from $2million cash to $1million cash or $2million property. Later that day, however, Hubers’ bond amount was increased to $5million by the regular judge. Judge Karen Thomas, who set the higher bond amount, will hold a hearing Friday to explain her rationale for the move, KYpost.com reported. Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. 'He had a strong feeling of wanting to help people who wouldn't otherwise have access to the legal system and who might be steamrolled by the legal system without someone there to help them,' said attorney Kenneth G. Hawley, who worked across the hall from Poston. His family and friends have described him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters. One of his friends, Matthew Herren, told the Kentucky Enquirer that he wouldn't have been surprised if Poston had run for Congress at a young age. High achievers: Hubers, left, took AP classes in high school and made the Dean's List in 2010, while Poston, right, opened his own law practice specializing in personal injury after getting his law degree in 2008 . Hubers graduated from Lexington’s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009. In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean’s List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major. Zevely said she is close with her parents, and her mother spent the day with her in Northern Kentucky prior to the shooting. A friend talking to the station WKYT described Hubers as a quiet and sweet girl who was smarter than most of her classmates.","Shayna Hubers is accused of gunning down 29-year-old lawyer Ryan Poston .

Exhausted: Heart patient Stephen Jones, aged 62, has said he does not blame hospital staff for his treatment, but admits it has left him 'dispirited' A heart patient was forced to travel 450 miles to and from hospital for life-saving surgery - only for it to be cancelled THREE TIMES. Stephen Jones, 62, was turned away three times in two weeks after taking three 150-mile round trips to hospital for heart bypass surgery. He is now patiently waiting for a major operation to replace a failing heart valve after being sent home untreated on August 24, 31 and September 5. Mr Jones, who suffers from heart disease, angina, asthma, emphysema and clinical depression, has said how exhausted he is by the repeated setbacks. The former health and safety consultant, from Tiverton, Devon, said: 'I'm exhausted mentally and physically. 'I've been backwards and forwards, building myself up again and again. 'Each time I go into hospital I have to arrange for a friend to come and stop at mine to look after my two dogs while I am in hospital. 'I have to arrange for my son to drive me in and pick me up. 'This is, including me, three people that are affected directly by this situation. 'I myself have had to prepare mentally for this operation each time only for that preparation to be dashed.' Mr Jones, who has to travel to Derriford hospital in Plymouth, said he does not blame hospital staff, but the NHS restructuring putting increased pressure on services. He was diagnosed with heart disease in 1996 following a heart attack. 'Extremely sorry': A spokesperson for Derriford Hospital blamed unexpected emergency patients requiring Intensive Care Unit beds for the Mr Jone's cancellations and apologised for the 'inadvertent distress and inconvenience' caused . He was admitted to Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital on August 10 after suffering chest pains and disorientation. After being told his heart had 'two years left in it', he was referred to Derriford's specialist heart unit for an operation on August 24. However, the operation was cancelled on the day at 4pm, after Mr Jones had gone 16 hours without food in preparation. He was then told to return on August 31, which he did, however, it was cancelled again after his operation was dropped due to urgency, despite Mr Jones having endured another 12 hours of fasting. It was then rescheduled for a third time - to September 6. But when he arrived at the hospital the day before the procedure he was informed the surgery had been cancelled yet again. Mr Jones said: 'My last thee experiences in Derriford have left me dispirited. Over-stretched: Derriford Hospital in Plymouth cancelled Mr Jones's surgery three times, sending him home untreated on each occasion . 'Not because of the staff, who have been really exceptional, but the way that the NHS is being tinkered with to make it unworkable.

Hospital managers said they were 'extremely sorry' for the triple rescheduling, which was due to emergency cases limiting intensive care beds.

She said: 'We are extremely sorry that Mr Jones' planned operation has been rescheduled on three separate occasions and sincerely apologise for the inadvertent distress and inconvenience caused to Mr Jones and his family for these instances. 'Unfortunately the availability of our intensive care beds was limited due to emergency patients and some patients requiring more complex care than predicted, hence experiencing a longer recovery.'","Stephen Jones, 62, was turned away three times in two weeks after taking three 150-mile round trips to a Plymouth hospital for heart bypass surgery ."

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . PUBLISHED: . 07:12 EST, 20 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 20 April 2012 . A corner shop owner embarked on a life of luxury with his wife by executing a 'Prince and Pauper' fraud worth £700,000. Mohammed Arfan, 39, and his 41-year old wife Riffit pocketed almost £100,000 in tax credits for their four children by saying he was broke and earned only £5,000 a year. At the same time the couple claimed they were earning £100,000 a year using false references to fraudulently claim a string of mortgage loans. Mohammed (left) and Riffit Arfan (right) told authorities they earned just £5,000 but they told banks they earned £100,000 to fraudulently claim benefits and secure loans to buy businesses, cars and houses . They owned two homes, two businesses and drove a Range Rover Sport worth £62,000 and a £38,000 BMW X5. The couple lived in a neat £200,000 semi-detached house in a cul-de-sac in Bury, Greater Manchester and Riffit set up her own fashion business. Their six-year fraud came to an end in 2010 after Arfan was arrested and charged with dealing drugs at his off licence in Stretford. Police began investigating the couple's finances and during a two year inquiry discovered they were living a life 'well beyond their means.' The two houses had been bought as a result of multiple false mortgage applications and Riffit was also found to have obtained a false mortgage to buy her fashion shop whilst the couple were claiming tax credits and other significant benefits. She failed to declare the shop to the authorities and even moved a tenant into the flat above - so could illegally pocket housing benefits. Today Arfan was starting a three year jail sentence after pleading guilty to 15 offences of mortgage fraud, false accounting, money laundering and fraudulent activity to obtain tax credits. Riffit pleaded guilty to nine offences of mortgage fraud, false accounting, money laundering and acquiring criminal property and was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for two years. After the case Ian Horrocks, Financial Investigator from GMP's Serious Crime Division said: 'The Arfans' were living a lifestyle and driving around in cars that many honest hard-working people can only dream of. Riffit Arfan was found to have obtained a false mortgage to buy her shop, Sahil Fashions . 'There is no doubt much of this money came from their illegal activities as neither had any discernible legitimate disclosed income that could fund such spending. 'In addition to this, they were still claiming benefits and taking away money that is there to support those who genuinely need it. 'Riffit's CV, which was recovered following her arrest, even went as far to say that she was adept at filling in official forms, such as income support and disability allowance. 'This couple tried to hide their criminal dishonesty behind a tangled web of 24 bank accounts. However, we were able to unpick their finances and discover exactly what money they had been spending.' Bolton Crown Court heard the applications were dishonestly filled out by the couple to obtain mortgages, loans and state benefits between 2003 and 2009. Ben Myers, prosecuting, said the police investigation into the couple's finances began in 2010 after Arfan was jailed for four years for drug dealing from his shop and running a cannabis farm, nearby. It emerged Arfan had claimed to earn just £5,000 a year from his shop to obtain £77,000 benefits only to then falsely say his annual wage was £72,000 to win mortgage loans. He was granted a loan of £15,000 after giving false references along with his wife and another loan for £38,000 to buy the BMW X5 before converting that to successfully applying to a building society for a mortgage of £174,000. He then used that money to buy a property in Bury, which was later used to run his cannabis farm. The couple told banks to buy property and cars including this £200,000 property and a BMW X5 . His wife successfully applied for a loan for £93,500, giving a dishonest annual income of £35,000 then used it to buy another property in Bury, from which she set up a fashion outlet. Yet to the DWP she never declared any income made and sold the property, making a profit. The couple also jointly applied for a loan to re-mortgage their property - for around £76,000. They acquired the Range Rover through hire purchase. In mitigation defence counsel Mr Mohammed Qazi, for Arfan, said: 'He expressed deep remorse and real appreciation that he has committed serious offences and how he intends to turn his life around.' 'He met his wife and married her against his family's wishes which led to him being isolated for a number of years. This has led to him seeking to establish his own lifestyle and family.' For Riffit, defence counsel Mr Jonathan Drury said her business had not been a success and there were still outstanding arrears. She had since been working as a clerk was looking after the children, one of which suffers from a spine disorder. He added: 'The situation has caused her severed stress and she has been on medication. It's not just her life hanging in the balance; it's also her four children's. They will have to go into care - it would make the damage exceptional.' Passing sentence Judge Martin Allweis told the couple: 'This was a persistent and sophisticated dishonesty to bolster your income and assets over a period of six years or so. 'You left no stone unturned. You falsely obtained benefits, cheating the public and finance companies by falsely declaring income.' 'I'm told that you're remorseful - but I have no doubt you are sorry you have been caught and I have no doubt you are sorry for the impact on you and your family.' 'But you were cheating the whole public.'","Couple were caught out when Mohammed Arfan was found to be selling illegal drugs from his off licence .

American reality TV star Kim Kardashian has sparked a new row over Heathrow baggage handlers after she accused British Airways workers of stealing 'irreplaceable' items from her luggage after a recent flight. She says staff at the airport, which is already facing claims it will struggle to cope with the surge in passengers during the Olympics,may have taken several handbags and 'priceless' sunglasses she inherited from her late father. The allegations spark new fears that security at Heathrow may be returning to the lax levels last seen in the 1980s when it was nicknamed Thiefrow due to its reputation for high rates of luggage theft. Furious: Kim Kardashian accused BA of stealing a pair of sunglasses given her by her late father Robert, right, who served as the lawyer sensationally who helped clear OJ Simpson of murder . Supermodel Naomi Campbell also accused BA staff of stealing her possessions during the 2008 baggage debacle and claimed she was a 'martyr' after being arrested for assaulting two police officers at Terminal 5. Miss Kardashian, whose father Robert was the lawyer who sensationally helped clear OJ Simpson of murder, arrived back in Los Angeles on Friday night after flying from Nice via Heathrow. She is said to have found that her luggage was significantly lighter than it had been on the way out. On further inspection, she is reported to have discovered that the sunglasses, which Robert gave her before he died in 2003, were missing from her case. U.S. website TMZ.com also claim that 'several extremely expensive purses and Tumi luggage' were missing. Allegations: Miss Kardashian arriving at Heathrow on May 16 to begin her nine-day European visit, left, and back in Los Angeles on Friday with her 'lighter' bags being pushed by a minder . Trial: A dry-run at Heathrow last week saw staff deal with an extra bags in preparation for the Olympics when it will deal with 600,000 extra visitors during the games-  and 43,000 more August 13 alone . Miss Kardashian had earlier written on her Twitter page: 'Very disappointed in British Airways for . opening my luggage & taking some special items of mine! Some things . are sentimental &not replaceable. 'What happened to the days when you . could lock your bags! We need to get back to that. There's no sense of . security & no trust! Shame on you(sic)' The reality star, who is back in Los Angeles after a whistle-stop promotional tour of London, . and then a week at the Cannes International Film Festival, is now said to have approached BA to look into the apparent theft by analysing CCTV footage. She arrived at Heathrow on May 16, spent nine days travelling before returning home on May 25. It is understood that she may take the matter to the police if the airline do not provide a satisfactory response. British Airways, which celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2009, is expecting to have one of its busiest summer ever as the main airliner carrying visitors to the Olympics. Heathrow, which will handle 80 per cent of Games traffic, is - at peak traffic - expected to handle up to 50,000 extra bags a day as it deals with an additional 600,000 passengers during the course of the sporting spectacle. Last week staff successfully carried out a dry run in practice for the Olympics when the processed 3,000 extra bags an hour. Rant: Kim had earlier taken to her Twitter to comment on the missing items . But memories of the 2008 Terminal 5 . baggage debacle - when thousands of passengers at BA's exclusive hub - . were left waiting days to be reunited with their luggage will make it hard for passengers to trust that chaos will not be repeated. Outlining fears, The Australian . newspaper published a picture of a stack of bags following last week's test run with the headline: . ‘50,000 extra reasons not to visit London during Olympics’. Arrest: Naomi Campbell is escorted from Heathrow in 2008 after she assaulted two police officers when she learned that one of her bags was missing . Huge queues at immigration have also prompted worries that Heathrow will not be able to cope with the increase in passengers. Yesterday a member of the International Olympic Committee said Heathrow was a ‘nightmare’ after taking two hours to clear passport checks. Barbara Kendall, 44, from New Zealand, tweeted: ‘Heathrow Airport Immigration is a nightmare!! took me 2 hours to get through and it is not Olympic time yet.’ Richard Branson today told ITV News the queues have been have been 'embarrassing'. Regarding Miss Kardashian's allegeations, a spokesman for British Airways said: 'We are continuing to investigate this matter. 'Our customer travelled from Nice to Heathrow Terminal 5 to Los Angeles. 'Terminal 5 has some of the most sophisticated automated baggage systems in the world, which are able to monitor bags every minute of their time in the terminal. 'At this stage, we have discovered no evidence to suggest that the bag in question was interfered with at Heathrow. 'Our investigation is also seeking to establish details of the bag's passage through Nice and Los Angeles airports.' A spokesman for BAA, the owners of Heathrow, said: ‘There are high levels of security at Heathrow.

AS the jury prepared to  consider their verdict in an assault trial, they received a helpful pointer from one of the defendants himself. Michael Ruse, 21, had a Facebook conversation with a friend saying of his crime that he thought he would ‘get away with it’. Unfortunately for the bragging attacker, one of his online followers took exception to the comment and printed it out before handing it in at Portsmouth Crown Court. Confronted with the evidence, Ruse was forced to change his plea to guilty and was given a suspended prison sentence and a curfew. Judge Ian Pearson told him: ‘You were stupid enough to put on Facebook what amounted to a full confession. Your stupidity really is not much mitigation.’ And Russell Pyne, defending, conceded: ‘He needs help with regard to thinking skills.’ Ruse, from Leigh Park, was on trial with his friend Terry Reeve accused of attacking Reeve’s father, Gareth, with a baseball bat and baton. During the two-week trial, the court heard that Reeve, 20, had thrown a brick at his father’s car in March last year. Reeve and Ruse then armed themselves with weapons and attacked the 45-year-old lorry driver in a street in Leigh Park. Mr Reeve was left with a cut  to his head and bruises all over his body. Ruse denied the charge and, just before the jury went out to consider their verdict, he  posted an update on the social networking site saying: ‘Another week at court.’ Asked by a  friend about the case he added: ‘Yeah I think I get away with it tbh x’, adding it was ‘looking good’. Guilty: Ruse, using the pseudonym Michael Miles, changed his plea after his Facebook updates were noticed . Stupid: Ruse described the judge as 'stuck up' in a Facebook update posted before he was sentenced . Confronted with the details of the . conversation, Ruse, who had denied assault causing actual bodily harm, . changed his plea to guilty. Having still not learned his lesson, Ruse, . who has previous convictions for assault and criminal damage, went back . online to describe the judge as ‘stuck-up’ hours before his sentencing. He was given a 46-week suspended jail term and an evening curfew was imposed. Even then, he was not finished. Ruse, who was also ordered to pay £250 . court costs, could not resist posting an update. Under his online alias . of ‘Michael Miles’, he wrote on Facebook: ‘Boom! Im coming home best . start sorting myself out. Tag for 6 months...and got to stay out of . trouble for 2 years.’ Running commentary: Ruse promised to let his friends know if he was sent to prison for the assault . Updates: Ruse wrote on his Facebook page daily to keep friends informed of his case's progress . Reeve, also of Leigh Park, was found guilty of the assault and criminal damage. He was jailed for a year and 55 days. Michael Ruse is far from the first criminal to regret his Facebook use. A paramedic who boasted on Facebook that he groped a patient’s breasts . whilst resuscitating her was found guilty of misconduct after his . comments were reported.

"By . Alex Brummer . PUBLISHED: . 12:09 EST, 16 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 16 July 2012 . The Chancellor suffered a new blow yesterday when the International Monetary Fund slashed its growth forecast for Britain. The financial watchdog predicted the UK economy would grow at a minuscule rate of 0.2 per cent this year and just 1.4 per cent next year. That is 0.6 percentage points less  for each year than the IMF forecast at its spring meeting in April and underlines the mammoth task ahead for George Osborne as he seeks to fire up the economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slashed its grow forecasts for the UK economy . Yesterday the Government unveiled plans to update the railways, but the £9billion of new investment to do so will not start until 2014, making it too late to have any immediate impact on production and growth. Business is placing more hope in the £80billion ‘Funding for Lending’ scheme unveiled last week and designed to funnel cheaper loans to small companies and home buyers. But leading bankers claim the demand for credit simply isn’t there because of low confidence caused by the crisis in Europe. The IMF blames the chaos in the eurozone for its decision to lower its forecast for the world economy and Britain. ‘Financial market and sovereign stress in the euro area periphery have ratcheted up to end-2011 levels,’ it says in its summer update. As a result, it expects the world economy as a whole to grow by just 3.5 per cent, against its previous forecast of 3.9 per cent. The eurozone crisis is continuing to have a negative impact on the UK economy, the IMF warned . It believes the single currency area will be in recession this year, with output falling by 0.3 per cent. Growth in the region in 2013 is predicted to be just 0.7 per cent. Among the bigger European economies, the IMF predicts a deep 1.6 per cent loss of production in Italy and a 1.5 per cent fall in output in Spain, with both economies staying in recession next year. The squeeze on consumer spending continued to loosen its grip in June as . inflation hit a 31-month low, figures tomorrow are expected to show. The consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation is forecast to dip . to 2.7% in June from 2.8% in May, as fuel and food prices continue to . ease. Last month, a sharp drop in commodity and oil prices paved the way for . the smallest rise in fuel prices since October 2009, dragging down the . headline inflation rate. Inflation has fallen from 5.2% last September due to the waning impact . of the VAT hike at the start of 2011, falling energy, food and commodity . prices and a number of bill cuts from utility providers in February. The organisation says it is ‘time for action’ if Europe is to come out of its freefall and stop dragging the rest of the world down with it. It calls on European leaders to follow through on promises made at their recent summit, including progress on banking and budgetary reforms. As a result of slower growth, the IMF warns the improvement in Britain’s budget deficit will be slower than expected, with borrowing remaining at 8.1 per cent of total output this year and 7.1 per cent next year. That is 0.5 percentage points worse than previously forecast. Slower growth means less tax income from companies and households, and higher costs for the Government because of increasing unemployment and welfare bills. The IMF urges advanced non-eurozone economies such as Britain ‘to respond effectively’ to the growth crisis by pushing ahead with further ‘unconventional measures’ such as quantitative easing. It has urged Britain to cut taxes and proceed with infrastructure projects this autumn if growth fails to materialise. Output in Britain is still more than 4 per cent below where it was before the financial crisis hit hard in 2008-09 and the UK is among the few advanced countries where lost ground has not been made up. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls called on the Government to get recovery back on track by ‘taking urgent action to boost the economy’. The Treasury said: ‘The IMF explain that “growth is projected to remain relatively weaker than in 2011 in regions connected more closely with the euro area”. ‘Because the euro area is the UK’s largest trading partner we are now feeling the effect across our economy. ‘But as the Chancellor said last week, we are not powerless to act in the face of the European debt storm: that’s why the Treasury and the Bank of England are taking co-ordinated action to inject new confidence and support the flow of credit to where it is needed in the real economy.’ The eurozone will be in limbo for another two months until a crucial  ruling on the legality of its new  500billion euro bailout fund. Germany’s supreme court will not decide until September 13 on whether Europe’s largest economy can sign up to the crucial measure. The delay means more weeks of  uncertainty on global financial markets as the credit crisis in Spain, Portugal and Italy worsens and Greece plunges further into bankruptcy. Academics, economists and citizens argue that Germany will jettison too much sovereignty by backing the fund and also supporting a fiscal pact enforcing debt reduction. They argue that the measures will undermine the power of its parliament to decide how to use taxpayers’ money. The fund, also known as the European Stability Mechanism, was due to start on July 1 but needs Germany to ratify it. Last week, finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble urged the court to act swiftly to avoid more turmoil in financial markets. The ESM and the fiscal pact are part of international treaties and once ratified, Germany will be bound by the measures.","Growth in 2012 will be just 0.2%, IMF economists predict - 0.6% down on previous forecast .

Langley believed his brother's sight could be restored with a diet high in vitamin C so he fed Homer 100 oranges a week.

The BBC hands out 25,000 contracts a year that can help its workers pay less tax, MPs reveal today. The off-the-books arrangements create ‘suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance’, according to Commons spending watchdog Margaret Hodge. The workers include 4,500 presenters and backroom employees paid through ‘personal service companies’ that allow them to limit substantially their tax liabilities. Arrangement: BBC stars Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman have both set up private service companies in order to be paid, but said that it was not their choice. The BBC is reported to hand out 25,000 contract a year so its stars can pay less tax . That figure – revealed by the BBC last night – is much higher than previously thought and covers 400 stars paid at least £50,000 a year. Of these, 148 are news presenters such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail he expected the corporation to take ‘swift and decisive action’ to address public concern about the tax arrangements. Thirteen thousand of the off-the-books contracts are for on-air roles. The BBC stressed that most are normal freelance contracts, rather than personal service company deals. The corporation, which said the 25,000 figure includes individuals with multiple contracts, has launched an internal review into the issue, while insisting it has done nothing wrong. Shock: Margaret Hodge said that the practice happens in other public sector areas and is almost always 'staggeringly inappropriate' But MPs last night said they were shocked by the scale of the issue at the BBC. In a damning report, the Commons public accounts committee said it was alarmed the Corporation could not ‘provide any assurance that these individuals are paying the correct amount of tax’. Mrs Hodge, the chairman of the committee, said the practice, which has been uncovered elsewhere in the public sector, ‘generates suspicions of complicity in tax avoidance and fails to meet the standards expected of public officials’. The Labour MP added: ‘We were shocked to discover that the BBC has about 25,000 off-payroll contracts. Some 13,000 of these are for individuals who are on our screens and on the radio every day. They are the public face of the BBC. ‘Avoiding tax and national insurance when paying public sector staff is almost always staggeringly inappropriate. ‘The public sector must maintain the highest standards of propriety in its employment practices if it is to show leadership in the fight against tax avoidance.’ Mr Alexander ordered a crackdown on the use of personal service companies in the public sector after it emerged that 2,400 senior civil servants were employed in this way. As an independent organisation, the BBC is beyond the scope of the Treasury review, but Mr Alexander has written to the Corporation’s new director-general George Entwistle asking him to follow suit. He told the Mail: ‘We took swift and decisive action to improve tax transparency in central government. I see no reason why, just like we have in central government, the BBC shouldn’t be able to provide assurance that its employees are paying the proper amount of tax and NI. The BBC is beyond the scope of a treasury review into the practice but Mr Alexander has written to the new Director General George Entwhistle asking him to crack down on personal service companies . ‘With a new broom at the top of the BBC there is an opportunity to look again at this issue. I look forward to seeing the findings of their review.’ So far the BBC has moved just two workers on to its  payroll as a result of its investigations. Those employed through personal service companies are responsible for ensuring they pay the right amount of tax and national insurance because it is not deducted from their salary at source. Unlike normal freelance contracts there is no liability against the BBC if a mistake is made. MPs heard evidence that the BBC requires some on-screen stars to set up these arrangements – a claim disputed by the corporation. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail he expected the BBC to take 'swift and decisive action' to address public concern about the tax arrangements . The BBC denies that the arrangement reduces its tax bill or that of top stars. It claims the practice is standard in the industry and reflects the fact that many presenters have other outside earnings. The Commons inquiry was launched in the wake of controversy over Student Loans Company boss Ed Lester’s employment through a personal service company without tax being deducted. Following a review, the Treasury disclosed in May that more than 2,400 Whitehall staff, each earning more than £58,200 a year, were being paid directly and without PAYE deductions. But the public accounts committee warned that the Treasury’s review of off-payroll arrangements had been ‘limited’ because it did not cover the wider public sector like local government, the NHS or the BBC. Mrs Hodge said the committee suspected ‘many individuals and employers in local government and in the health service do not pay their proper tax and national insurance contributions’. In a statement last night the BBC said: ‘We note the conclusions of the PAC report and will respond to the points raised as part of our detailed review of tax arrangements.’ A spokesman added: ‘The BBC pointed out that this relates to 25,000 contracts and not 25,000 people, and that in many cases an individual – such as an occasional contributor to programmes – could be issued with a contract each time he or she is booked to appear.’ Mr Paxman has said it was not his choice to be paid through a private service company. The Newsnight presenter insisted the BBC had ‘required me to form a company if I wanted to continue to present Newsnight. It claimed it had been told to do so by the HMRC’. Antiques Roadshow presenter Miss Bruce said she had formed a company because ‘it was a stipulation laid down by the BBC’. Last year tax inspectors launched just 23 investigations into breaches of the law surrounding personal service companies – down from more than 1,000 a year a decade ago.","Workers paid via personal service companies include 4,500 presenters and backroom staff with 400 paid at least £50,000 a year .

David Cameron today attempted to play down his rivalry with Boris Johnson, by branding the London Mayor a ‘blond-haired mop’. The Prime Minister insisted he had the ‘opposite of tall poppy syndrome’ and was happy to see Mr Johnson making headlines. But senior Tories are anxious that the Mayor, who regularly outpolls the PM, could dominate the Conservative party conference with a series of bravura performances in Birmingham this week. Boris Johnson's outbursts have caused a headache for Tory strategists but prove popular with voters . Last week Mr Johnson stunned ministers when he claimed Downing Street’s slow progress in addressing aviation capacity risked ‘economic catastrophe’. He has also challenged Mr Cameron over Europe and banking, and even suggested the police should have arrested chief whip Andrew Mitchell for calling officers ‘plebs’. Today Mr Cameron heaped praise on Mr Johnson, but admitted there was ‘no point trying to contain Boris’. ‘He will always speak his mind. He’s Mayor of London, he can speak out if he wants to. ‘So I have to be, and I am, relatively, as you can see, relaxed about having the blond haired mop sounding off from time to time. Every premiership has its backdrop, and I suspect this is just going to be one of mine,’ he told The Sunday Telegraph. The Prime Minister and London Mayor are old school friends from Eton, but have had to get used to sharing the limelight . Later Mr Cameron insisted he did not think being London Mayor would be Mr Johnson’s last job. ‘I have got the opposite of tall poppy syndrome. I like having other people in the Conservative Party who are popular, who get out there, talk our message and explain our vision and values,’ he told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show. ‘Boris is fantastic like that. He is one of those politicians people warm to and I think it is great that we have in our party figures like that.’ He added: ‘I have said to Boris: “Once you have done your job as London Mayor, don't think your job in politics is over”. ‘I think he has got a huge amount to offer, a huge amount to give and I encourage him to do that.‘I think it is great that the greatest city in the world has got such a good mayor.’ David Cameron told BBC One's Marr Show that he had 'the opposite of tall poppy syndrome' The charm offensive comes as senior Tories fear Mr Johnson’s antics will dominate the four-day conference. One opinion showed voters prefer the London Mayor to Mr Cameron by a wide margin. The survey by pollsters Opinium for The Observer gave Mr Johnson a net +30 rating compared to -21 for the Prime Minister. Today Tim Loughton, a former education minister, said that Mr Johnson's potential leadership challenge was a ‘sideshow’. ‘Boris is a fantastic character; very media savvy, very high recognition for doing a fantastic job as Mayor of London but he’s not going to be Prime Minister of this country, he’s not going to be leader of the Conservative party,’ he told Sky News.","The Prime Minister says he has 'the opposite of tall poppy syndrome' as he heaps praise on his old school pal from Eton .

Catty comments: Stella McCartney is struggling to sell her home in Notting Hill, west London . As a renowned fashion designer, Stella McCartney is used to being praised for her sense of style. When it comes to her judgment in home interiors, however, opinion is rather  more divided. Photographs of the 41-year-old’s £2.5million townhouse in West London, put on the internet to try to tempt buyers, have met with some catty comments. The minimalist white decor and simple wooden floors came under fire, with one critic calling it ‘one of the blandest fashion designer-owned pads I’ve ever seen. She couldn’t even throw a staged red couch in there or something to give it some life?’ Another sneered that Miss McCartney’s style was ‘blah and bland’. But others sprang to her defence, writing: ‘How can you judge her on an empty house?’ The property’s online profile does display one indication of offbeat design sense that should appease the critics, though: one image shows Miss McCartney has placed a bath tub in what looks more like a living area than a bathroom.

A biker who lost control of his motorcycle, killing himself and his girlfriend in a 67mph crash, had only passed his test three days earlier, an inquest heard today. Julian Farley, 25, and his partner Jessica Ellis, 23, died in a massive impact with a road sign after they fell from his 865cc Triumph Speedmaster motorcycle. Mr Farley had been accelerating to overtake a 17-year-old motorist in a Nissan Micra on the A339 between Alton and Basingstoke, Hampshire, on Saturday, March 3 this year. Killed: Julian Farley (left) and his girlfriend Jessica Ellis (right) died in a motorcycle crash in Hampshire . A police investigation found that the bike had been travelling at about 67mph in a 40mph zone when Mr Farley lost control, the inquest in Alton was told. A friend of the couple, Imogen Wright, told the hearing that, on the day they died, they had travelled from their home in Portsmouth to visit her near Basingstoke. 'Jules had passed his motorcycle test on Wednesday and had bought a new bike,” she said. 'He appeared very proud of his new bike. 'He took me on a ride around the block.' The inquest heard that the pair were in good spirits when they left and they intended to avoid motorways on their journey home. On the way, they encountered college student Keiran Lenachan's black Nissan Micra. Mr Lenachan, who was 17 and passed his driving test in October last year, was travelling with two friends Ben Harman and Rees Higgs. The three were preparing to go on a night out. 'Inexperienced': Julian Farley was riding this 865cc Triumph Speedmaster motorcycle. He had passed his test only three days before the collision . The hearing was told that, as they arrived at a roundabout in the left-hand lane, a motorcyclist with pillion passenger got into the right lane but tried to take the same exit as them. Both vehicles had to slow and Mr Harman was heard to mutter the word 'idiot', the inquest was told. The biker pulled in behind them and as they travelled along they came up behind a slow-moving Renault Clio. As the road widened to become a dual carriageway, Mr Lenachan said he indicated and checked rear and side-view mirrors. 'I was so shocked I couldn't speak. I didn't know what to do or say' - Witness Rees Higgs . 'The motorcyclist was directly behind . me in my top mirror, probably about 6ft or a car length behind,” he . said. 'He didn’t look like he was going to overtake at all. 'As I started overtaking I saw sparks (in my mirror) and someone said ""Stop"", so I pulled into the lay-by.' The three got out of the car and ran back along the road, where they found the bodies of Mr Farley and Miss Ellis. Other people arrived at the scene and a van driver felt for a pulse on Mr Farley but said: 'He’s gone.' Mr Lenachan and his friends then all went into shock and had to be checked by paramedics, the hearing was told. Mr Higgs said: 'I was so shocked I couldn’t speak. I didn’t know what to do or say. 'I couldn’t stop staring at the bodies even though I didn’t want to.' The inquest heard that Mr Lenachan was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving but he was never charged. Police at the scene found a skidmark which showed that Mr Farley's front tyre had veered towards the centre of the road. 'I have dealt with more motorbike deaths on the A339 than I dread to think' - North-East Hampshire coroner Andrew Bradley . Gouges were found in the road surface up to the point where the bike came to rest, more than 200ft further along the carriageway. Antony Johnson, a retired police officer and a member of the Hampshire Police forensic collision investigation team, said: 'There is no physical evidence to suggest why the rider had taken this action - presumably because of events taking place in front of the Triumph. 'There is a possibility that experience, or inexperience, may have played a part in this incident.' The force of the crash had dislodged the road sign from one of its supporting posts, the hearing was told. Andrew Bradley, the coroner for north-east Hampshire, recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'I have been the coroner here for 23 years and I have dealt with more motorbike deaths on the A339 than I dread to think. 'It has been the most appalling road but it has improved...and this was a fairly isolated incident.' After the hearing, Miss Ellis’s father Tony said: 'It’s a tragic accident and two beautiful young lives have been lost and lots of people are suffering. 'We weren’t here to blame. There are no winners and losers in this.' He said of his daughter: 'She was the life and soul of the party. She was bubbly, eccentric, she was a big human being in a little package.'","Julian Farley, 25, and Jessica Ellis, 23, died on A339 in Hampshire .

Google CEO Larry Page; The European Union's antitrust chief gave Google a 'last chance' of a few weeks to avoid formal charges for manipulating search results to promote Google services . Google risks becoming a publishing monopoly within a few years, Italy's antitrust chief said on Tuesday. The company's grip on the search market means that it has a control over people's access to information. Google has also made moves into the ebook and online publishing markets, and now sells music and video via its Play Store. The company unveiled a new version of its Google TV software which brings Google to televisions as well as smartphones and computers. ‘In the course of a few years, Google . could become a monopoly in this market,’ Giovanni Pitruzzella told . Italy's lower house of parliament, referring to the publishing sector. Web companies such as Google and social networks should be subject to the same laws as offline companies, said Pitruzzella. The country's antitrust regulation . should extend to internet media including social networks, which are . competing with traditional publishing companies for advertising . revenues, Pitruzzella added. Google is already under investigation for anticompetitive practices - and was given one month to change its advertising rules otherwise it will face court action in the EU. The . giant Internet search-engine firm has been ordered by EU competition . regulators to make the changes by July 2 to end ‘abuses’ of its market . dominance. The company, . which says it anticipates complaints of this kind due to its size and . reach, risks being fined billions of pounds if it fails to comply with . the orders. The search . engine, which has more than 80 per cent of the global market share, is . accused of promoting its own products and effectively locking out rival . advertisers. Google risks becoming a publishing monopoly within a few years, Italy's antitrust chief said on Tuesday . The EU complaints add to similar concerns in the US and South Korea, where the company is also being investigated for allegedly abusing its near-monopoly position as an Internet search engine. A Google spokesperson said: 'We operate in over 100 countries around the world, and the . Internet is disruptive by its nature. 'It's understandable that our . business should attract scrutiny and sometimes complaints in a few of . these countries. We are always happy to answer questions authorities may . have about our business.' The voice-controlled Sony gadget will offer access to video channels and web searches - and has a motion-controlled remote for playing games . Complaints: Google is under EU spotlight over its Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled smartphones . The . European Commission has written to the US giant highlighting four areas . where ‘Google business practices may be considered as abuses of . dominance’. If Google's . solutions are not satisfactory, the EC will begin a formal . investigation, which could lead to it imposing huge fines and its own . measures. The . announcement heralds the most significant transatlantic anti-competition . row since Brussels went to war with Microsoft a decade ago. It will also embarrass the Tory Party which has forged close links with Google, as revealed by the Daily Mail last week. Research revealed that ministers, including David Cameron, had met executives an average of once a month since the election. Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition chief, has written to Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt demanding action. He said Google favours its own products in search results and ‘copies’ content from rivals without permission. It . also stifles competitors with advertising deals with other websites and . restricts them from moving their online campaigns to rival search . engines, he added. The review of Google’s business practices started in 2010 after complaints from rivals. The commission can levy fines of up to 10 per cent of revenue, which could amount to billions of pounds. Google has agreed to look into the EC’s concerns, though it disputed its conclusions. A spokesman said competition on the web has increased ‘dramatically’ and the company faces ‘tremendous’ pressures. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched a similar investigation into claims of anti-competitive practices by Google. Even . if Google, the world's most popular search engine, offers concessions, . it will still be under the EU spotlight after fresh complaints about its . Android mobile software, the top operating system for Internet-enabled . smartphones. If remedies were offered by Google within the coming weeks, the antitrust investigation could be brought to a close. ‘I . believe that these fast-moving markets would particularly benefit from a . quick resolution of the competition issues identified. Restoring . competition swiftly to the benefit of users at an early stage is always . better than lengthy proceedings,’ Almunia told a news briefing. ‘Google . has repeatedly expressed to me its willingness to discuss any concerns . that the Commission might have without having to engage in adversarial . proceedings. 'This is why today I'm giving Google an opportunity to offer remedies to address concerns that we have identified,’ he said. Almunia said he had sent a letter to Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, with a deadline for a response. ‘In . this letter, I offer Google the possibility to come up in a matter of . weeks with first proposals of remedies to address each of these points,’ he said. The European Commission launched an investigation into Google in November 2010 after competitors, including Microsoft, accused the company of manipulating search results to promote its own advertising services while demoting those of rivals . Competitors complain that Google's search results unfairly prioritise its own advertising services. Google controls nearly 44% of the global internet advertising market. The . Trade Commission is also looking into allegations that Google distorts . its search results to steer people to its related businesses, like . Google Places. The agency recently hired a big name litigator, Beth Wilkinson, to lead its probe. The . Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest . grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including . TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams. The majority of complaints are from small competitors across Europe. The . FTC is expected to come to a decision this summer on whether Google . broke the law. Google is also the leader in U.S. searches, at 66 . percent, according to comScore. Almunia . is offering Google a last chance before issuing formal charges, said . David Wood, a lawyer for lobbying group ICOMP, whose members include . Microsoft, British price comparison site Foundem and German online . mapping company Hotmaps, all three complainants in the EU case. ‘This is effectively the Commission demanding remedies. Failing that there will be a statement of objections,’ he said. If . Google can come up with remedies that the Commission finds acceptable . following a market test, the Commission could then end the 18-month-long . investigation without fining the company, Almunia said. The . Commission has 16 complaints against Google before it, with the latest . grievances coming from several online travel agencies, including . TripAdvisor, Opodo and eDreams.

Akanksha Rathi, 32, told police her mother and father-in-law had tried to stop her claiming her husband Anirudh Rathi’s inheritance - and said she had never been good enough for him. The glamorous businesswoman, renowned in India's male-dominated steel industry, was found dead at her parent's home in Delhi on October 23, just weeks after her husband, 34, died of a heart attack. She had claimed the family waged a campaign of mental harassment following Mr Rathi’s death on September 4 to stop her inheriting a share of the family steel empire. Harassed by in-laws: Akanksha Rathi, 32, was found dead just days after she told police that her in-laws tried to stop her claiming her husband Anirudh Rathi's inheritance . Mrs Rathi had improved a branch of the Rathi family business into a £43million a year company in a few years and had won the Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Award in 2009.

Drink-driver Michael York killed passengers Matthew Brown and Samuel Turner after losing control of his car . A mother hugged her son's killer moments before he was jailed for causing his death by drink driving and even offered words of comfort, telling him 'you can get through this'. Mandie Brown embraced defendant Michael York who was more than twice the legal alcohol limit when he crashed his car, killing her son Matthew Brown and friend Samuel Turner, who were passengers. Before he was sentenced, Mrs Brown told York: 'Don't worry. Whatever happens, you can get through this.' York, 20, went out for a 12 hour drinking session before getting behind the wheel of the car and wept loudly throughout the hearing before being jailed for five years. Mrs Brown, from Sapcote in Leicestershire,  said: 'I do not blame Michael at all. I hugged him and told him not to worry. 'What happened was that four friends went out together and had a good time. 'Michael should not have driven and the other lads, including my son, should not have got into the car. 'I do not in any way condone drink-driving but I am not judging Michael and I do not want anyone else to or be angry at him. 'He apologised to my face after the accident. I know he and his family are hurting.' Another passenger, William Turner, Samuel's brother, survived the accident, which happened after York had drunk 26 units of alcohol. Sentencing, Judge Simon Hammond, said: 'This was an avoidable crash. These two young men need not have been killed. You should have never, ever have got behind the wheel of a car.' Prosecuting, Andrew Vout said York started drinking with his friends at around 5.45pm, on October 21, 2011, where he drank between four and six pints of lager. He then drove to a second pub where he had three or four more pints, before visiting two Leicester nightclubs where he drank sambuca shots and more beer. CCTV footage showed York returning to his car in a near-by car park at 6.12am. Mr Vout added: 'It shows Mr York unsteady on his feet. Mr York had some difficulty manoeuvring the car out of the car park.' The fatal crash happened shortly after York got into the vehicle, and it is believed the driver steered to avoid a bollard before losing control of the vehicle, and ploughing into a tree. Tragedy: Flowers at the scene of the accident where the two victims were killed . Matthew, 23, and Samuel, 18, both from Stoney Stanton, Leics, were in the rear seats, were killed, while front passenger William Turner, suffered a broken collar bone. York was also injured. York pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of causing death by careless driving. Blood tests taken at the hospital revealed York would have had around 208mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood at time - almost three times the legal limit of 80mg. In mitigation, Kevin Lynch said York was genuinely remorseful. Mr Lynch said: 'He will punish himself for a great deal longer than any sentence given by this court. His actions, and the consequences of this action, will stay with my client for the rest of his life.' He said York, who had tried to kill himself since the accident, had a six-month-old daughter from a previous relationship, and his current girlfriend was four months pregnant. Judge Hammond ordered York to spend two five-year prison sentences behind bars, to run concurrently, and he was banned from driving for five years. He said: 'It should have been obvious to anyone that with that much drink, you should not have gone anywhere near that car.'","Mandie Brown embraced Michael York at his sentencing at Leicester Crown Court - telling him 'You can get through this'

The tech giants are set to release tablets within days of each other later this month. Apple is expected to launch its iPad mini on October 17th - a week before Amazon releases its tablets in the UK, and Microsoft releases its own Surface tablet. Almost ready for prime time? Website Apple.Pro revealed these images of the alleged eight-inch iPad Mini, due to launch on October 17 . The Mini launch comes as research suggests a quarter of us - 22 per . cent - own a tablet, with another three per cent regularly borrowing . someone else's tablet for web browsing. About 68 per cent of the 9,5123 adults surveyed said they purchased their tablet within the last year. The U.S. survey by the Pew Research Center also suggests the flood of . cheaper tablets, such as the Google Nexus or Amazon Fire, are weakening . Apple's grip on the market. A year ago, Apple had more than 80 per cent of the market, but this has now dropped to less around 52 per cent. The Kindle Fire has 21 per cent of the market, meanwhile Samsung's Galaxy tablet has eight per cent. Out of those surveyed, 44 per cent of adults who said they have a . smartphone, 46 per cent have an Android phone, 38 per cent, have an . iPhone and 10 per cent have a Blackberry. Apple's iPad mini is expected to so on sale around the world on November 2nd, according to online speculation. The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'. The . device is believed to have similar hardware to last year's iPad 2, but . reduced to a pocket-friendly seven or eight-inch form. Fortune reports that Apple will send . out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and . stakeholders together to unveil the device. Amazon, meanwhile has already enjoyed huge success in the US with its updated Fire tablets - but will release them internationally for the first time on the 25th October. The gadgets, are available in both 7inch and 8.9inch versions (although only the 7inch version is currently set to go o sale outside of the US). The third contender is Microsoft, with its Surface tablets. The firm will launch the Surface tablet at the same time as Windows 8, the latest version of its desktop operating system, whcih experts say is a 'make or break' time for the firm. 'It's a dangerous game, as all three firms are trying to steal each other's thunder,' said Tom Wiggins of gadget magazine Stuff. 'Apple tend to be more cagey. 'If I was Apple, and knew that Microsoft . was launching, I'd probably try and come up with something to take the . focus away from them - and nobody else can do that in quite the same way . Apple can.' Wiggins believes that Microsoft has so far played its cards close to its chest with the Surface tablet.The firm has not even confirmed a price for the gadget. 'Microsoft is the most interesting - it's a make or break thing for them, as they have always struggled with touchscreen interfaces. 'It has the potential to be a success - but the worry is that it will be overcomplicated compared to the iPad.' However, it is Apple's iPad mini that is expected to attract most attention. 'The iPad mini is potentially huge,' said Wiggins. 'But a lot will depend on price. There are a lot of people who would like an iPad but can't afford one, so if it does launch and is £250, it will be very difficult for anyone to beat.' Experts also believe that Amazon's Kindle, which is being launched outside the US for the first tim, could be let down if not enough content is available. The gadget uses Amazon's own app and film and book stores. Steve Jobs famously ruled on a smaller iPad, saying 'The current crop of 7-inch tablets are going to be DOA, dead on arrival. 'We don't think you can make a great tablet with a 7-inch screen.' However, devices like the Amazon Kindle and Google's Nexus 7 have shown that there is a market for smaller devices that consumers can use on public transport, causing Apple to reportedly change its mind on an 'iPad mini' with a 7 or 8 inch screen. The firm has reportedly placed orders for ten million of the devices, which are also likely to feature the firms controversial new connector. 'Kindle Fire is a difficult one, especially in the UK,' said Wiggins. 'It is dependent on its content delivery, and they will have to have a lot of UK content at launch for it to work - but Kindle is a very strong brand now.. However, Wiggins also believes that the technique could also backfire - by confusing consumers. 'It is quite possible consumers will get confused,' he said. 'After the iPhone launched, a lot of competitors came out, and people did get confused. The iPad will continue to be the benchmark, the danger for Microsoft and Amazon is that people will ask 'can it do what an iPad does?' Most secrecy has surround the iPad Mini, a shrunken version . of Apple's market-changing tablet, is expected to launch on October 17, . with the device available in shops on November 2. If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London. Images purporting to show the iPad . Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover . similar to the most recent iPad. It is likely to sport a rear-facing . camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a . controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers . obsolete without an adapter. If Apple follows its usual design . styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice . of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed. The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market. The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range. Steve Jobs was . unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a . poor compromise between a tablet and a phone. However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured. One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines. Until the release of the iPhone 5, . Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning . apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform. But with the increased screen size of . the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the . developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's . tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini.","Unprecedented timing will see three launches this month .

An African war criminal who joined in the slaughter of civilians has been allowed to stay in Britain under human rights law – because he admitted his crimes in a BBC interview. The man was a fighter in the Janjaweed militia which killed an estimated 300,000 people during the war in Darfur, but he came to Britain after hearing it was ‘a good place to claim asylum’. An immigration tribunal found he was guilty of crimes against humanity after he gave media interviews in which he described joining in the burning and looting of 30 villages and shooting countless victims. War criminal: The man was a fighter in the Janjaweed militia which killed an estimated 300,000 people during the war in Darfur, but he came to Britain after hearing it was 'a good place to claim asylum' But a judge has ruled that the 27-year-old must be allowed to stay in Britain because his life could be at risk if he returned to his home country. She said that as a result of the media interviews he gave voluntarily in this country in which he criticised his former commanders and revealed embarrassing political information about the conflict, they might try to kill or hurt him if he was sent home. In interviews with BBC Newsnight and The Times his identity remained secret and his face was hidden in pictures and footage. But the judge ruled that word had got around the Sudanese community in this country about who man was and as a result his life was at risk. It follows other cases where individuals accused of committing horrendous violence have been granted refuge in Britain. They include a Serbian war crime suspect and a former henchman of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe. This latest case involves a former goatherd who joined the Janjaweed militia in 2003. During the conflict in Sudan, Janjaweed forces attacked dozens of non-Arab tribes in a burning and killing spree now regarded as ethnic cleansing. Dictator: It follows other cases where individuals accused of committing horrendous violence have been granted refuge in Britain. They include a former henchman of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe (pictured) After more than two years as a paid . fighter he deserted and came to the UK because he was told it was ‘a . good place to claim asylum’. The man, who is not being named by the Daily Mail, arrived in 2006 and claimed asylum but his case was not decided by officials until last year. In 2008 he gave interviews to The Times and Newsnight. In one, he said: ‘You will not distinguish between children, the elderly or women. You just shoot and kill everybody.’ He also admitted seeing his fellow soldiers committing rape, but denied taking part. He told The Times he lost count of the number of people he shot. On BBC2’s Newsnight he described ‘innocent people running out and being killed including children’. Immigration officials, pointing to the interviews he gave, ruled that he was exempt from refugee status. The Geneva Convention allows war criminals to be refused asylum. Officials said he could return to Sudan and live in another part of the country safely because his identity was not known. But . the man appealed and in October last year an immigration judge granted . him asylum and ruled his human rights under Articles 2 and 3 of the . Human Rights Act – the right to life and protection against torture – . would be infringed if he returned. Unimpressed: Tory MP Dominic Raab (pictured) said Britain should be a 'safe haven' for peeopl fleeing torture and persecution, rather than a 'soft touch for those carrying it out' Judge CJ Lloyd said she thought it was ‘fairer’ to examine the evidence he gave to the tribunal in person in which he changed his story entirely and claimed he had ‘never killed anyone in his life but was careful to shoot in the air’. She also concluded he would be at risk from the Sudanese government if returned because his name would have leaked out. The Home Office appealed and in an Upper Tribunal ruling published last week Judge Hanson ruled the man did join in attacks against civilians and had ‘criminal responsibility’. He overturned the decision to grant asylum on the grounds the man was a war criminal. But he upheld the human rights ruling which found the man was at risk if returned to Sudan – as a result of the interviews he gave. The war criminal will now be allowed to remain in this country indefinitely. He cannot claim benefits, work or study and the only controls that can be placed on him is a reporting requirement. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘Britain should be a safe haven for those fleeing torture and persecution, not a soft touch for those carrying it out.' A UK Border Agency spokesman said: 'We refuse to give sanctuary to those accused of war crimes. They should be removed to face justice in their home country, and we will do everything we can to make that happen. 'If we cannot remove them immediately – for example, if the courts rule they may be tortured or killed upon return – we now ensure such individuals are monitored and subjected to stringent reporting and employment restrictions until we can arrange their safe removal.'","Fighter in the Janjaweed militia which killed 300,000 during war in Darfur .

A dream home for golf fanatics has gone on sale for £4 million complete with its own championship length 18-hole course.

He has enjoyed the . luxury of having the challenging course to himself on a daily basis, . with family and friends occasionally joining him by invitation. A rural residence, the only one with a championship size golf course in the grounds, has gone on sale for £4 million . Idehill Manor in Devon, complete with its own private golf course designed by its unidentified owner . The stunning course boasts the longest recognised golf hole in Britain - a 740 yard par 6 . Now aged in his 70s, the retired businessman is looking to downsize from the 16th century nine-bed manor house that was once owned by King George II and latterly by the Earl of Ilchester. The grade II listed property, that comes with 51 acres of grounds with 'views to die for' according to the brochure, also includes a two bed yeoman's cottage complete with separate entrance. It has gone on the market for £3.95 million. At the moment a local greenkeeper is employed by the owner to maintain the course - the fairways and greens are cut once every fours days. The main house has six reception rooms, a . snooker room, a heated swimming pool and original beams and fire . places. The largely thatched building also features six bathrooms with . the master bedroom overlooking the pool and adjoining sun terrace. The owner designed the 18 hole course himself after moving into the manor 10 years ago . Whoever snaps up the property can enjoy a swim after a round of golf as the manor also boasts its own swimming pool . The course has its own greenkeeper who keeps it in shape by cutting the grass every four days . The pensioner, who shares the property in Farway, near Honiton, with his wife, said he will be sad to leave the home. He said: 'It is the only private championship-length golf course on the British Isles and it does have the longest hole in the country as well. 'We bought the house 10 years ago. I’m a keen golfer and I had 50 acres of land to myself so it made sense. 'I designed the course myself and the first tee is only 100 yards from the main entrance. The traditional beamed kitchen at the grade 2 listed manor . The property also comes with this stunning two-bedroom cottage complete with its own entrance driveway . 'The course extends to three sides of the house and is very sympathetic to the landscape, which is one of the reasons why it doesn’t have any bunkers. 'The other reason is due to maintenance, as you don’t have to worry about cutting around them. 'The best time to play is at 7am on a Sunday when all you can hear are the birds and sheep. The formal dining room which also boasts a woodburner and French windows to the garden . The Idehill Manor homeowner currently employs a greenkeeper to ensure that the fairways and greens are kept in top condition . A golfer overlooks the grounds of Idehill Manor which is described by estate agents as having 'views to die for' 'You don’t have to worry about waiting your turn to play or other golfers whistling a shot past your head. 'We do have to down-size. It is a big place and looking after the course is a big job. 'I would hope that whoever buys it will keep the course but it is up to them. 'I would have thought it would appeal to somebody who has a lot of money, who is a keen golfer and who wants to live in a lovely house that used to be owned by a King. The new owner of Idehill Manor in Devon can also enjoy a game of snooker inside . 'There is great kudos in being able to say to friends or business clients ""come and have a game on my golf course"".' What you get for £3.95 million if you buy grade 2 listed Idehill Manor: . The golf course extends to 6,117 yards and is a par 73. There are four par threes, 10 par fours, three par fives and a par six. The owner plays off a handicap of eight strokes over the par but his best score is 79. One of his favourite holes is the 15th, which has a tall oak tree 100 yards in front of the green and requires an accurate tee shot either side of it. The property is being sold by Exeter-based estate agents Jackson-Stopps and Staff. Agent Graham Dixon said: 'It is very rare for a property with its own private golf course to come on the market.

After their numbers came in to make them £161million richer, Britain's biggest EuroMillions lottery winners declared they were going to have 'so much fun'. And almost twelve months later, Colin and Christine Weir are still doing just that - by spending some of their fortune on a luxury indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi. The couple want to build the improvements to their £850,000 mansion in Largs, Ayrshire, which they bought with their winnings last year. Lavish: Colin and Christine Weir have submitted plans for a raft of improvements to their £850,000 mansion . Plans submitted to North Ayrshire Council show the project will feature a full-size swimming pool, a spa pool, changing rooms with shower facilities, a plant room and airing cupboard. The pool room will be connected to the main house through a new hallway and include Roman-style ornamental statues . Colin, 64, a former Scottish Television cameraman, and his wife Chris, 56, have also applied to build another, more traditional, conservatory at the side of the house with a balcony on top. The property already has a cinema and stables, and it emerged last month that proposals for a luxury greenhouse, featuring automatic lights and rain sensors, had been submitted to the council. Desirable: The mansion in Largs, Ayrshire, was bought by the couple last September and already boasts a cinema and stables . Neighbours have been invited to view the new plans, and Historic Scotland is also likely to be consulted as the mansion is a listed building. The couple, who have been married for more than 30 years, have hired York-based firm Oak Leaf Conservatories to carry out the work. A source said: 'The plans show that the pool house and conservatory are going to be very luxurious. 'Colin and Chris have been in the new house for a while now and must feel it's time to put their own stamp on it. 'The project will cost a few quid but it's not as if they can't afford it. Splashing out: The couple have already submitted proposals for a luxury greenhouse, featuring automatic lights and rain sensors . Having fun: Colin and Chris Weir became Britain's biggest lottery winners when they scooped the £161million jackpot last July . 'All the paperwork has been sent to the council's planning department and it is expected it will get approval barring any serious objections.' The Weirs lived in a modest £180,000 three-bedroom home in Largs when they hit the jackpot in July last year. They said they visited their local chippy three times a week and drank Coke and Irn-Bru, but the big win put a champagne lifestyle within their grasp in an instant. Things didn't go smoothly at first, as the couple went to Spain after receiving letters from hundreds of people begging them for cash. Happy couple: The Weirs, who have been married for more than 30 years, have hired a York-based firm to carry out the work on their dream home . The way they were: The couple lived in a modest three-bedroom house before their jackpot win. They gifted the property to a neighbour after they bought the mansion . But the couple soon showed their generosity, gifting their old home to a neighbour after they bought the mansion last September. They are sponsoring 15-year-old Scottish racing driver Gregor Ramsay in his first season competing in European and Italian Formula Three events. Earlier this month it emerged that Mr Weir had pledged to give £750,000 to his local football team, Largs Thistle, to help them clear debts and improve their facilities. And the couple made a seven-figure donation to the Scottish National Party to support its campaign for Scotland to break away from the rest of the UK. Mr Weir is a lifelong supporter of the SNP and stood as the party’s candidate in Ayr at the 1987 General Election – coming fourth in the poll.

Criticism: In a statement on her website, Halifax MP Linda Riordan, pictured, said she would cease renting her £400,000 South London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie . A Labour MP exposed for pocketing £19,000 a year by renting out her taxpayer-funded second home to a colleague was shamed into ending the arrangement last night. In a statement on her website, Halifax MP Linda Riordan said she would cease renting her £400,000 South London flat to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie after facing a wave of criticism. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) responded to the public outcry over the issue by announcing it would review rules that allow MPs to rent their homes to other politicians. An investigation by the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that Mrs Riordan was exploiting a loophole in the new expenses rules that allows MPs to rent out their second homes for profit while claiming thousands in expenses to rent a third home from themselves. In her statement last night Mrs Riordan insisted she had acted within the rules and cleared the arrangement with Ipsa. But she added: ‘I now recognise what the perception of this arrangement will look like to my constituents and the wider general public. 'I understand Ipsa is consulting on this and other issues and it is right they look at it. When the tenancy concludes I will cease this arrangement.’ At least 27 MPs are thought to be involved in the practice, including well-known names such as shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, former defence secretary Liam Fox and former defence ministers Sir Nick Harvey and Sir Peter Luff. Four Scots MPs were included in the list of MPs – Labour’s Ian Davidson and Jim Murphy – the former Scottish Secretary – ex-Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson. Portfolio: Riordan's £400,000 London flat which she rented to fellow Labour MP Iain McKenzie for £1,560 a month . Tenant: Iain McKenzie, pictured with his wife Alison McKenzie, had confirmed he was renting the property . Mrs Riordan is thought to be one of . four MPs renting out their second homes to fellow MPs. Mr McKenzie pays . her £1,560 a month in rent – equal to £18,720 a year – which he claims . back from the taxpayer. Mrs . Riordan’s mortgage is thought to be about £560 a month, leaving her a . clear profit of £1,000. At the same time, Mrs Riordan, 59, has claimed . £1,473 a month in expenses to rent another home in London for herself. She also employs her partner, Stephen Roberts, as a ‘senior researcher’ on a salary of up to £42,000 a year. Mr McKenzie said he had not known the flat was owned by an MP when he rented it via an agency, and said he felt uncomfortable about the arrangement. At least 27 MPs are thought to be involved in the practice, including well-known names such as shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, left, and former defence secretary Liam Fox, right . The revelations about Mrs Riordan led to a torrent of criticism in her West Yorkshire constituency yesterday. One local said on the website of the Halifax Courier: ‘This reminds me of Champagne Socialism: YOU have the socialism and I’ll have the Champagne.’ Ipsa said it would review the rules surrounding rentals but it insisted it could not prevent MPs who own a property in London from renting it out for profit. Commons Speaker John Bercow was accused of trying to suppress details of the matter after warning Ipsa revealing the identities of politicians’ landlords would be a ‘security risk’.","Halifax MP .

PUBLISHED: . 02:20 EST, 23 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:51 EST, 17 July 2012 . Eating out when you're an A-lister can be fraught with risk. A chance meeting with a paparazzo lurking in a doorway can mean a snap of your unkempt hair or a make-up free face splashed across the papers the next day. So it's no wonder celebrities are flocking to try out a new service that means they can have a restaurant experience in the comfort of their own  home. Lily Allen and Stephen Fry are just two of a number of famous names who swear by housebites.com, a recently opened gourmet-to-go delivery and takeaway service that means customers - A-list or otherwise - can order restaurant quality food cooked by a top chef and have it delivered direct to their door. Take it away! Lily Allen and Steven Fry are two celebrities who have used housebites.com to order restaurant quality food to their home . The company, so far only available in London, has a list of chefs who work out of specific postcodes of London. When a customer enters their postcode and the day and time they would like to order food, the chefs available to deliver or cook for collection appear, with their full menus detailed. Customers can choose from a full three-course menu, which could be from any international cuisine, from French to Indian, Chinese or Moroccan. The chefs will then conjure up the feast, package it in takeaway containers and whizz it straight to the buyer's door, or have it ready to be collected if they are out of the catchment area. Freshly cooked food: Delivery and takeaway website housebites.com say they have reinvented the takeaway . The kind of dishes on offer range from hearty homecooked Italian meatballs and lasagne to tasty Provencal fish dishes or traditional Indian cooking. The firm has cheekily released a top five list of dishes most ordered by A-listers - and the diversity of the list illustrates the variety of food the service offers. At the top is sea bass with new potatoes and courgettes, followed by chicken tikka masala (these A-listers are terribly traditional!), boeuf Provencal, tuna steak with vegetables, and Asian pork belly with sticky rice. We ordered to Kensington, and at the time we wanted to eat, French Provencal chef Laurent Rossi was available and he was close enough to deliver. There were a further two chefs on duty, one who specialised in Indian food, one who specialised in Moroccan. Both of these could cook for us, but as they were around two miles away, our food would have to be collected. Chef Laurent Rossi is an award-winning French chef with 20 years experience who has worked across the Caribbean, the U.S. and the UK, and at some of the city's top restaurants including No 1 Lombard St, L'Oranger in Mayfair, and L'Aventure in St John's Wood. He is based in the West London area, and can also offer a private dining service for dinner parties as well as running his own successful chocolatier (www.chocololo.com). Today though, we chose from his menu on housebites.com. We started with beetroot carpaccio, which was served with a well-dressed rocket salad, nuggets of tangy onion and cucumber caviar - tiny little palate-baffling balls of cucumber that chef Rossi had carved out. A fresh viola flower added a pretty flourish. A warm goat's cheese salad with roasted vegetables was the perfect balance of sharp, crumbly-soft cheese and sweet red and yellow peppers, with roasted carrot and courgette adding substance. Two decades of experience: Award-winning chef Laurent Rossi . As our main course, we had seabass fillet, pan fried to perfection, with fennel and potatoes. A chicken and tarragon fricasee, its creamy sauce, dotted with green grapes incredibly moreish, was accompanied by delicate towers of creamy dauphinoise potatoes. Pudding was French toast with toffee apple sauce, a generous portion that we initially crowed in disbelief would feed six - then promptly ate between two. The caramel sauce was fragrant with rosemary and orange blossom, and rich with cider. Sinfully good. The food, which came packaged in plastic containers encased in neat cardboard sleeves, travelled well. Our delivery slot was just half an hour long, the wait from ordering to arrival 45 minutes. And as for the make or break question of price - well, this was no more expensive than our local Chinese takeaway - but we felt a lot better about eating it. The seabass was £12, the chicken £10.95. Pudding was £5.95, the starters were £4.50 for the beetroot and £5.50 for the goat's cheese salad.We certainly felt the prices were more than fair, given the quality of the food and service. There are no preservatives, no short-cuts. The menus change frequently, the ingredients are fresh. You can order fresh grilled fish; a salad. Proper vegetables that were in the ground a few days ago, not in a packet. In fact, you can put in a request for your favourite Provencal dish to Laurent and he may well just cook it for you. On his Twitter feed (@rossi_laurent) you can find out what he is cooking today. Beautiful flavours, restaurant quality - but eaten in the comfort of your own home. We are sold.

A baby who was born with a growth on her face the size of a melon has made an incredible recovery after having life-saving surgery to have it removed. Mia Molyneux was born with a huge cyst on the side of her face - that was bigger than her own head, and weighed almost half as much as she did. Surgeons battled to remove the growth in a gruelling nine-hour operation - which saw little Mia have 96 pints of blood pumped into her tiny body to keep her alive. Doctors urged Michaela to terminate her pregnancy because they thought Mia could be disabled, but she refused . Now aged 20 weeks, she has finally been given the all clear to go back to the family home in Widnes, Cheshire. Her mother Michaela, 20, said: 'I was absolutely terrified when I found out Mia had something wrong with her. 'The doctors were urging me to terminate the pregnancy, as they feared Mia would be severely disabled, but I absolutely refused. 'When she was born I fell in love with her instantly. When I looked at her I saw my baby girl alive, not the growth. 'The operation to remove the it was really risky - I was terrified the cyst would rupture and she would bleed to death - but the surgeons were amazing. 'She needed 96 pints of blood transfued - the average baby only has one pint in their body. I'm just so glad to have my little girl home with me at last.'Medics realised there was something wrong with the pregnancy after Michaela, desperate to know the sex of her baby, booked herself in for an extra ultrasound scan. Before; Mia's cyst was due to the abnormal development of the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues . After: Surgeons managed to remove the cyst following nine hours of surgery . Sonographers quickly spotted a huge swelling on the baby's face - and feared she would be born with severe disabilities. Michaela said: 'I booked an extra scan at 17 weeks at Warrington Hospital to find out the sex of the baby because I was so impatient. 'The sonographer was staring at the screen and instantly I knew something was wrong. He said he could see swelling so booked me in for a more detailed examination the next day.' Doctors were concerned about the baby and urged Michaela to terminate the pregnancy, but the mother-to-be refused to give up on her unborn baby. At 36 weeks pregnant, still unsure of her unborn baby's exact prognosis, Michaela had an MRI scan which confirmed that Mia had combined venous-lymphatic malformation. Mia will always have some scarring. Her mother said: 'I'm so proud of her.' The ultra-rare condition results from an abnormal development of the lymphatic vessels that drain fluid from tissues. When these vessels develop abnormally they can cause a localised swelling, often with cysts, and sometimes blood vessels can also develop abnormally in the same area. A caesarean was planned for 27 March, at Liverpool Women's Hospital, as a natural birth would be too dangerous for the pair. Doctors explained they would need to carry out a risky procedure during the birth where they would insert a ventilator into Mia's throat before the umbilical cord was cut, to help her breathe. Medics were so worried about the procedure, there were 18 doctors and nurses in the room when Mia was born. She was rushed to intensive care after the baby's lung collapsed minutes after birth. Michaela said: 'Mia was bought to see me before she was rushed to intensive care at just three hours old. My legs weren't working because of the spinal block so I couldn't lean over to see her, so the doctor guided my hand in to feel her face.' When Mia was just six days old, surgeons decided to operate on the cyst. Michaela said: 'The surgeon explained that there was a risk that it might rupture and that she would bleed and they wouldn't be able to control it. 'They said if that happened then there will be nothing they can do for her. I was worried but I knew she was in the safest possible hands. Mia had several bleeds but luckily with a bit of pressure they managed to stop them.' Dr Adam Donne, paediatric ENT surgeon at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, carried out the surgery and said: 'This was an extremely difficult and rare case and Mia's condition was critical. The lesion was very delicate and therefore bleeding was challenging. 'Following surgery, Mia continued to be cared for by our Intensive Care team before she became well enough to recover on our neurosurgical ward. 'Although she required further surgery, she has now returned home and we are pleased with her progress. 'This is a wonderful example of how the doctors and nurses throughout Alder Hey work well together to save the life of a newborn.' After nine hours Mia came out of surgery and started her recovery. Michaela said: 'She looked so battered and bruised, it was heartbreaking seeing her in that state. It was so hard not being able to hold her until she was 15 days old.' Now, at 20 weeks old, Mia has been able to go home to her proud mum. Michaela said: 'Mia will be scarred for life but it's a small price to pay. When her bandages came off after the surgery I used to still wrap her up in them when we went outside because I was worried what people would think. 'Now I don't, she's been through so much and I'm so proud of her.'","Doctors told Mia's parents she could die if cyst ruptured during nine-hour surgery .

A nationwide collapse in house prices has led to the widest ‘North-South’ divide since records began, research revealed yesterday. Prices have fallen in every region since the peak in 2007, with property values in Northern Ireland crashing by 53 per cent. But falls in the North have been far greater than in the South. House prices have plunged by up to 53 per cent since the peak in 2007, with the North, Wales and Northern Ireland dominating the worst hit areas . To live in the South, you have to pay a premium of nearly £100,000 on the price you would pay in the North, according to the Nationwide Building Society. At present, a home in the South costs an average of £231,245, compared to £135,340 in the North. The news comes a day after the Mail revealed that a lavish property with 25 acres of park land, a clock tower,  stables and servants’ quarters in the Durham village of Rushyford has sold for just £241,000. In contrast, the average home in the West London borough of Kensington and Chelsea costs more  than £1million. Growing divide: Prices have fallen nationwide (left) but the north has suffered more than the south. Average house prices in the north of England have slipped from 70 per cent to 59 per cent of average southern England prices since 2005 (right) Nationwide said house prices have . fallen in every single region of Britain since the peak, but some . regions have been far worse affected than others. Overall, . the Nationwide's figures show house prices have more than halved since . 2007 in Northern Ireland, but typically dropped by between 10 to 15 per . cent in other regions. Prices . are down only 1.9 per cent in London, but 9.7 per cent in the South . West, 11.1 per cent in East Anglia, 14 per cent in Yorkshire and the . Humber and 16.1 per cent in the North West. Robert . Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, said the jobs market was . crucial to the future of house prices. If unemployment rose sharply, . they were likely to fall further. 'Labour market developments will remain of paramount importance in deciding the trajectory of house prices,' he said. ‘There . are grounds for caution on this front as the unusual combination of . rising employment and declining economic activity that was evident in . the first half of 2012 is unlikely to be sustained.’ The . figures highlight the nightmare facing homeowners who bought their . property five years ago, and have seen its value collapse. Many are . trapped in negative equity, which means the size of their mortgage is . larger than the current value of their property. Overall, national house prices peaked in October 2007 at £186,044. Today the average price is £163,964, down 11.9 per cent. Ed . Stansfield, chief property economist at the consultancy Capital . Economics, said: ‘It certainly seems as though the housing market is one . area where there is precious little evidence of ‘green shoots’. ‘Given . the fragile nature of the economy, the huge squeeze on real incomes and . offsetting impact of ultra-low interest rates, this gradual downward . drift in house prices makes sense.’ Mark .

"By . Hugo Duncan . PUBLISHED: . 19:19 EST, 11 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:37 EST, 12 April 2012 . British workers should be forced to delay their retirements now or see £750billion added to the national debt, the International Monetary Fund warned yesterday. It said the country faced financial ruin if the average lifespan in the UK rose by just three years more than predicted. The organisation warned that if that happened, £750billion would be added . to the national debt by 2050 to pay for the increased cost of pensions and healthcare. Grey future: The IMF suggested a further increase in retirement ages, higher contributions into pension pots from employers and employees, and smaller payouts to those in old age . That would push the debt burden up from 76 per cent of national output to as much as 135 per cent. In a report into so-called ‘longevity . risk’, the Washington-based IMF urged governments to tackle the problem . now before it is too late. It . suggested a further increase in retirement ages, higher contributions . into pension pots from employers and employees, and smaller payouts to . those in old age. The . report also said countries should consider linking the retirement age . to life expectancy – an option being explored in Downing Street. ‘An . essential reform is to allow retirement ages to increase along with . expected longevity,’ the IMF report said. ‘This could be mandated by the government, but individuals could also be incentivised to delay retirement.’ The proposals raise the prospect of millions of Britons working into their seventies and even eighties. The state pension age is already being increased to 67 for men and women by 2028, and to 68 by 2046. Warning: The IMF said the national debt would spiral out of control if the average lifespan in the UK rose by just three years more than predicted . However, experts say linking the pension age to life expectancy would inevitably mean more rapid increases. Nevertheless, Laura Kodres, an assistant director at the IMF, said such a plan would ‘keep the number of years in retirement constant’ and ease the strain on the public finances. ‘The longer you ignore it, the more difficult it becomes to resolve,’ she said. ‘The time to act is now.’ Demographers continue to expect the rise in life expectancy to slow down – but such a phenomenon has yet to occur in Britain. After the Second World War, when the state pension age was 65 for men, their life expectancy was 66.4 years, while women’s was 72.5 years. In 1977 the Government  was guided by actuaries who predicted that average life expectancy in 2011 would  be 71. In fact, men today typically live to 77, while the figure is 82 for women. By 2056, the life expectancy for a man and woman living in England is expected to be 84 and 89 respectively. The IMF said forecasts ‘have consistently underestimated how long people live’. Pension book: Over the years as people have began to live longer, the pressure on the country has increased . It claimed that predictions about longevity over the past 20 years had been too low by an average of about three years. The IMF forecasts that the global cost of providing for an elderly population – based on replacing 60 per cent of pre-retirement income – will double over the coming  40 years. In advanced countries such as ours, the annual cost will rise from 5 per cent of gross domestic product to 11 per cent. ‘If individuals live three years longer than expected – in line with underestimations in  the past – the already large cost of ageing could increase by another 50 per cent,’ the  IMF argued. It said this would heighten the threat to government finances and could also damage ‘the solvency of private financial and corporate institutions exposed to longevity risk’. The risks were greatest for institutions offering defined benefit pension plans and life annuities, it said.",IMF predicted national debt could spiral to 135% of national income by 2050 if the average lifespan in the UK rose by just three years more than predicted .

But it seemed that Kate has gotten so into the Olympic fever that she is competing against her husband for the title of Team GB's top supporter after she was spotted back at the Olympic Park less than twenty four hours later, but this time without her husband. Kate took to the balcony to cheer on the British hockey team who were playing Pakistan at the Riverbank Arena this evening, but William wasn't too far behind, being interviewed on the BBC sofa at the nearby Media Centre by presenter Sue Barker.

Princes Harry and William look smart in navy blazers and Team GB pins as they talk to BBC host Sue Barker at the Media Centre in the Olympic Village . Beaming: The Princes were understandably delighted with their Royal relation Zara Phillips' gold medal in the equestrian eventing . Princes William and Harry, along with the Duchess of Cambridge, have been spotted in crowds at various Olympic events since the start of the Games, rarely holding back in their cheering of Team GB. The trio were on their feet roaring Sir Chris Hoy to his fifth gold medal at the velodrome. Today, William said seeing cousin Zara Phillips win a silver medal in the equestrian eventing was 'absolutely fantastic'. 'Emotionally I got completely carried away in the moment. 'We both missed her European and World Championships when she was there, we were always supporting her from the television so to actually be there when she got a medal and they’ve done so well as a team, and to see Team GB do brilliant so early on in the Olympics, I had goose-bumps on the back of my neck and I got far too carried away.' Harry said she had been working 'so hard' to get to where she had got to, adding: 'We as cousins are very, very proud, it now explains why we never get to see her because she is always riding.' Asked what their favourite moments were, William said Phillips’ medal was the most emotional and most involved for him because of the personal connection. But he also paid tribute to the 'unsung stars' who have had their 'massive moment', such as Etienne Stott and Tim Baillie, who took gold in the canoe slalom yesterday. 'That was absolutely fantastic, we were glued to the television yesterday watching that. The noise was incredible, seeing them jump into the water and swim around with the team I think was such a release for them.' He went on: 'I think the velodrome last night with Sir Chris Hoy, that was absolutely fantastic, the world records being beaten and the atmosphere in there was electric. 'Every time they went round the other side of the audience roared louder than the other side.' Harry confessed last night was the first time he has been part of a 'slow motion Mexican wave' and the pictures were 'absolutely hysterical'. William added: 'If there’s things that come out of the Olympics that really last for the legacy of the future, things like where the girls have done really, really well and really branched out hopefully the young will follow and we can have more successes.' Prince Harry said: 'This Olympics more than any other I think is huge inspirationally for the next generation and the generations beyond as well. 'It’s great to see, just looking out of this window now, the thousands of people strolling past, most people with kids. 'The Games should be a chance to get people out and for ourselves trying to encourage children to do the whole sporting activity thing rather than sitting in front of the TV and playing computer games is hugely important and having the Olympics in London is a fortunate stepping stone for that.' As a keen hockey player at school, Kate watched avidly and showed her support as soon as the team scored their first goal. Earlier on today the Duchess joined Prime Minister David Cameron and former 400m British Olympic champion Sally Gunnell to watch heptathlete Jessica Ennis set a new record in the 100m hurdles. As . an ambassador for Team GB Kate's presence is a brilliant support for . the team, and she followed up yesterday's patriotic wardrobe choice of a .

Ennis, from Sheffield, will also be competing in the high jump, . shot-put and 200m heats today. The gruelling seven-discipline event ends . with the javelin, long jump, and 800m on Saturday. She is the current world silver medallist and world indoor champion who . unfortunately missed the Beijing Olympics because of injury.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:12 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 22:14 EST, 17 October 2012 . The foreign student arrested over an attempt to blow-up the New York Federal Reserve on Wednesday cited an extremist publication as inspiration for his deadly plans. Quazi Nafis, 21, reportedly learned how to make a bomb from an . article published by al-Qaeda in the magazine . ‘Inspire.’ The magazine contained a piece titled, ‘How to Make a Bomb in the Kitchen with your Mom,’ telling . readers how to construct a detonating bomb with everyday household . items. Dangerous material: Quazi Nafis, who allegedly tried to blow up the Federal Reserve with a 1000lb bomb, had been reading jihadist publication Inspire . Sting operation: The FBI arrested a man who allegedly plotted to blow up the Federal Bank in New York, which is only blocks away from ground zero . Inspire is an English-language magazine produced by al-Qaeda supporters on the Arabian Peninsula. One issue specifies how to create a remote-controlled bomb with a list of ingredients and parts followed by a photographic manual. Another issue suggested that a good way to forward the jihadist mission would be to mow down pedestrians in a pick-up truck. Handgun training and tips on being an 'urban assassin' are also included in the easily accessible terrorist magazine online. An American, 26-year-old Samir Khan, from North Carolina, was the driving force behind the publication and penned the piece on making a bomb at your mom's kitchen table. In another article in 2010, he wrote about his pride at leaving the U.S. and joining al-Qaeda in Yemen. In the piece, Khan mocked the U.S. intelligence agencies and pledged his support to the terrorist group. He was killed in a 2011 drone strike in Yemen by the CIA along with al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, another contributor to the magazine. Despite their deaths, new issues of the magazine have appeared, promoting jihad through explanations on how to start forest fires and build remote-controlled bombs. Creative force: Anwar al-Awlaki (left) and Samir Khan (right) ran jihadist magazine Inspire until their deaths in 2011 . Plot: Pedestrians pass the Federal Reserve Building today; authorities arrested a Bangladeshi man they said was plotting to blow up the Federal Reserve . Home: A man stands outside the residence of Quazi Nafis, the alleged Federal Reserve plot suspect . An article written this year is titled 'It Is of Your Freedom to Ignite a Firebomb' - and gives detailed instructions on how to spark a forest-fire, with Montana singled out as the ideal location. QuaziNafis was arrested in an elaborate FBI sting on Wednesday after attempting to blow up a fake car bomb outside the Federal Reserve building in Manhattan, authorities said. Before trying to carry out the alleged plot, Nafis went to a warehouse to help assemble a 1,000-pound bomb using inert material. He also asked an undercover agent to videotape him saying: 'We will not stop until we attain victory or martyrdom.' Agents grabbed the 21-year-old Nafis - armed with a cellphone he believed was rigged as a detonator - after he made several attempts to blow up the bomb inside a vehicle parked next to the Federal Reserve. Authorities emphasized that the plot . never posed an actual risk. However, they claimed the case demonstrated . the value of using sting operations to neutralize young extremists eager . to harm Americans. Rights: A courtroom sketch shows Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, second right, being arraigned in Brooklyn today . 'Attempting to destroy a landmark building and kill or maim untold numbers of innocent bystanders is about as serious as the imagination can conjure,' said Mary Galligan, acting head of the FBI's New York office. 'The defendant faces appropriately severe consequences.' afis appeared in federal court in Brooklyn to face charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to provide material support to al-Qaeda. Wearing a brown T-shirt and black jeans, he was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea. His defense attorney had no comment outside court. The defendant had sought assurances from an undercover agent posing as an al-Qaeda contact that the terrorist group would support the operation. 'The thing that I want to do, ask you about, is that, the thing I'm doing, it's under al-Qaeda?' he was recorded saying during a meeting in bugged hotel room in Queens, according to the complaint. In a September meeting in the same hotel room, Nafis 'confirmed he was ready to kill himself during the course of the attack, but indicated he wanted to return to Bangladesh to see his family one last time to set his affairs in order,' the complaint said. But there was no allegation that Nafis actually received training or direction from the terrorist group. Prosecutors say Nafis traveled to the U.S. on a student visa in January to carry out an attack. In July, he contacted a confidential informant, telling him he wanted to form a terror cell, the criminal complaint said. In further conversations, authorities said Nafis proposed several spots for his attack, including the New York Stock Exchange - and that in a written letter taking responsibility for the Federal Reserve job he was about to carry out, he said he wanted to 'destroy America'. Other communications took place through Facebook. A Twitter account with the suspect's name and photo had six followers and two messages and was linked to a Facebook page that had been taken down. Federal officials were at the home where Nafis was staying, a red brick building in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens. Owner Rafiqul Islam said Nafis was staying with his second-floor tenants, and he was told he was related to the family. The tenants didn't answer their door and their apartment was dark. Islam said the federal officials had come to the home when he was at work in Manhattan. He said Nafis had only lived there about a month or so. 'I didn't notice anything, he spoke to me very quietly,' Islam said. 'He said he was going to be studying here.' Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the case is one more reminder that New York remains a target: . 'New York continues to be very much in the mind frame of terrorism. This individual came here with the express purpose of committing a terrorist attack; he was motivated by al-Qaeda. We see this threat as being with us for a long time to come.' Kelly said security is always a precaution and there are about a thousand officers in the counterterrorism division. He didn't specify if any additional measures were being taken. The bank, located at 33 Liberty St., is one of 12 branches around the country that, along with the Board of Governors in Washington, make up the Federal Reserve System that serves as the central bank of the United States. It sets interest rates. The Federal Reserve is one of the most fortified buildings in the city, smack in the middle of a massive security effort headed by the New York Police Department where a network of thousands of private and police cameras watch for suspicious activity. The department uses sophisticated programs that can search for suspicious activity, like an object in one place for a long time, at the building modeled after London's 'ring of steel'. The analytic software also is designed to take video and catalog it according to movements, shapes and colors, so officers can set parameters to search the system for, say, a suspicious van. The Fed is also home to the world's largest accumulation of gold, according to the bank's website. Dozens of governments and central banks store a portion of their gold reserves in high-security vaults deep beneath the building. In recent years, it held 216 million troy ounces of gold, or more than a fifth of all global monetary gold reserves, making it a bigger bullion depository than Fort Knox.","English-language publication Inspire produced by al-Qaeda supporters .

Spree: The princess, seen attending a dinner at Buckingham Palace, paid a surprise visit to an antiques centre in an Essex village . It was a rainy afternoon at the antiques centre and traders were wondering if they’d see another customer before closing time. Then suddenly all their pay days came at once. A Thai princess arrived unannounced in a 15-vehicle motorcade and spent the next eight hours snapping up china plates, glass and ornaments. By the time her shopping spree had finished, many shelves were empty and the dealers were planning celebration suppers. The surprise visit of Princess Consort Srirasmi happened this week at the Essex village of Battlesbridge, where 80 antiques traders sell their wares. Sweeping into the car park came a convoy including chauffeur-driven limousines with blacked-out windows, a mini bus and vans. The 40-year-old princess immediately set about selecting items before an army of assistants labelled them and packed them into boxes. Dealer Jim Gallie estimated she spent at least £20,000 at different stalls. ‘She was mostly after china,’ he said. ‘She wasn’t buying particularly expensive items – but she bought a lot. ‘One dealer was completely cleared out of Lladro figurines.’ Another seller, Helen Smythe, said the princess bought more than 100 items at her store alone. They included solid silver and porcelain tea sets, Royal Worcester china and Tupton Ware ceramics, Royal Doulton figurines and more than 30 oil lamps. It was about 3pm and the rain was falling and I’d been thinking about having a cup of coffee - you just don’t expect a Royal to run up.' she said. She added: ‘There were between 15 and 20 people in the party including the princess, diplomats and the royal physician.’ Joe Pettitt said the princess had ‘literally cleaned out’ some traders. ‘Some of them are back out scouring the country to replace the goods she bought,’ he said. ‘It’s great for us because it puts us on the map but also it’s a recession and we need business like this. ‘I really am delighted on behalf of all the dealers here that the princess chose to visit us.’ Trader Jon Bedford, 29, shows off an antique vase snapped up by the Thai princess . Princess Consort Srirasmi spent thousands during an eight-hour shopping spree at the village antiques centre . In July the princess visited another antiques centre, in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, and spent more . than £10,000 on 300 pieces of bone china. On that occasion she was accompanied by her husband, the crown prince and heir to the Thai throne, Maha Vajiralongkorn, 60. They had flown to Farnborough in a private jet. Joe Pettitt, aged 72, from Battlesbridge, is seen with some of the pieces he sold to the royal visitor . Purchases: Mr Pettitt said some traders were 'literally cleaned out' of stock following the princess' shopping spree . The princess is Crown Prince Vajiralongkor’s third wife, his junior by 20 years. The couple were guests at the Queen’s diamond jubilee supper in Buckingham Palace in May. Highly educated, with degrees in management and home economics, Princess Srirasmi hit the headlines in November 2009, when a home video was released on Wikileaks showing her topless at a family party.

Jimmy Savile's former personal assistant has likened the predatory paedophile to 'Peter Pan', saying he was 'forever surrounding himself with youngsters'. After claiming earlier this week that Savile's alleged victims were 'jumping on the bandwagon' for money, she has now admitted she could have been duped by the star. Janet Cope, 70, was the former TV . presenter's PA for 32 years, until she was suddenly sacked by him in . 2001. The pair were so close he even gave her away at her wedding in . 1990. Jimmy Savile pictured next to his personal assistant Janet Cope wearing a Jim'll Fix It T-shirt . The pair pictured in 1980 where Mrs Cope is working as his PA. Savile sacked her out of the blue in a hospital meeting years later . In a turnaround, she told the Daily Mirror: 'He was eccentric, manipulative, controlling. I was frightened to death of him and I wasn’t the only one. He loved the power he had over people.' 'He thought he was untouchable because he was hand in glove with the hospitals, royalty and the Prime Minister.' She added: 'He was like Peter Pan, forever surrounding himself with youngsters. It was his elixir.' Savile cruelly fired Mrs Cope without her warning during a meeting with doctors and administrators at Stoke Mandeville hospital in 2001. Originally, after hearing the claims he was a child abuser, she stuck by her friend, claiming that people had become 'fanciful' and suggested victims had made the claims up. She suggested that Savile was often pictured with young women because it helped preserve his youthful image. Janet Cope on her wedding day with her husband Gerald, left, and Jimmy Savile, right, who gave her away . Mrs Cope, 70, left, says the former DJ was like 'Peter Pan' because he was 'forever surrounding himself with youngsters' Mrs Cope spoke out after another one of the Jim'll Fix It presenter's victims came forward. His former paperboy said he was 15-years-old when Savile invited him into his flat to give a £40 Christmas bonus and told him, 'Now you've got to really earn it'. The man, who does not want to be named, told The Sun that Savile pulled down his jeans and molested him, before the presenter then pulled down his own trousers and underpants. Luckily, he managed to escape from his apartment block in Roundhay, Leeds. He said: 'He would have raped me if I hadn't got out of there.' He had been delivering papers to Savile's block for almost a year when the attack happened in Christmas 1975. He said: 'He started kissing the back of my neck and said, ""You've got to earn this,"" and pressed me against the door and tried to have sex with me'. The boy quit his round the following month. He is the fourth male victim to come forward in the wake of the scandal. The news comes as it was announced that former High Court . judge Dame Janet Smith and ex-Sky News executive Nick Pollard are to . lead the BBC’s independent reviews stemming from the sex abuse . allegations surrounding the late DJ. Dame . Janet, who led the inquiry into mass killer Harold Shipman, will lead . the examination of the 'culture and practices of the BBC' during the . years Savile worked there. The former DJ, pictured, cruelly sacked Mrs Cope in 2001 at a meeting in the hospital where they met . Mr Pollard, a former head of Sky News, will look into whether there were any 'failings' in the way a Newsnight investigation into claims against Savile was handled. The planned news report was dropped late last year and there have been repeated suggestions the decision was made because the BBC was already planning to do more favourable programmes, claims which the BBC has repeatedly denied. Dame Janet's review will include evidence from people who have made allegations about being sexually abused by Savile on BBC premises or while on location for the corporation. Police believe the DJ and television presenter’s alleged catalogue of sex abuse could have spanned six decades and included about 60 victims.","Janet Cope originally suggested victims were making claims up for money .

"By . Mark Duell and Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 02:54 EST, 22 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:10 EST, 22 October 2012 . Killer: Christopher Halliwell, 48, of Swindon, was jailed last week for 25 years at Bristol Crown Court . The taxi driver who stabbed to death an office worker owned 80 cars and 'must have' struck in the eight-year gap between his two murders, police believe. Authorities believe Christopher Halliwell . may well have struck in the gap between murdering Sian O'Callaghan and his . first victim Rebecca Godden, 20 - whom he confessed to killing but . escaped justice due to a police blunder. The divorced father-of-three was jailed . for 25 years last week for murdering Miss O'Callaghan, 22, who . disappeared after leaving a nightclub in March of last year after a . night out with friends. Now it has emerged Halliwell has worked across the country and owned about 80 different vehicles which he could have used to pick up more victims. He is believed to have used his job . as a taxi driver to target women outside clubs and in red light . districts - and studied forensics to keep ahead of police, reported the Daily Mirror. A . police source told the newspaper: ‘It is inconceivable there was an . eight-year gap between the murder of Becky and Sian with no further . crimes… Had he not been arrested for Sian’s murder, he would have gone . on to attack more women.’ The source said police are looking at a . ‘potential offending period of more than 30 years’ since his teens and . they believe he was ‘very forensically aware’. It has also emerged that Halliwell, 48, of Swindon, allegedly once asked a fellow inmate: ‘How many do you need to be a serial killer?’. He is said to have asked the question about serial killers aged 20 while in prison after being jailed for four years in 1984 for raiding upmarket country homes for antiques. His cellmate replied: ‘At least three’, before he reportedly asked the prisoner: ‘Have you ever thought of strangling your girlfriend during sex?’ The chilling conversation between the inmates is said to have emerged when police officers were investigating Halliwell over the two murders. Both dead: Halliwell has been jailed for at least 25 years for the murder of Sian O'Callaghan (left) but a second charge over the death of Rebecca Godden (right) was withdrawn due to a breach of police protocol . It comes following revelations from . Halliwell’s ex-lover Heather Widdowson that they had sex just hours . after he murdered Miss O'Callaghan. She was unaware when she got into bed . with him that he had abducted and stabbed the woman - and claimed . he was ‘laughing and joking’. Bare-chested: Halliwell seemed 'completely normal' the day after the attack, according to his then-girlfriend Heather Widdowson . The ex-lover also told the Sun . that he texted her to say he loved her shortly before he carried . out his brutal attack on Miss O'Callaghan. The office worker was making her way . back to the home she shared with her boyfriend after leaving Swindon's . Suju nightclub when she got into Halliwell's green Toyota Avensis taxi. Instead of taking her home, the killer . drove Miss O'Callaghan to nearby Savernake Forest where he sexually . assaulted and killed her. The cab driver also moved Miss . O'Callaghan's body to a location in Uffington, Oxfordshire. He . eventually led police to her remains following his arrest later in the month of March in 2011. Halliwell's ex-wife Lisa, a nurse, . said the killer collected his teenage son in his taxi the day after his . attack on Miss O'Callaghan. She said he sent a grovelling letter to . his family for forgiveness. It has also emerged that Halliwell could now face questioning over a string of unsolved killings. Sentencing him last week to at least . 25 years for Miss O'Callaghan's murder, Mrs Justice Cox DBE said . he abused his position as a taxi driver - and the woman would have suffered 'extreme fear'. Halliwell escaped justice over the . charge related to Miss Godden’s death after a judge ruled his legal . rights had been breached by detectives during the course of their . investigations. Christopher Halliwell has been urged by his daughter to give the family of a second woman he killed 'justice' over her murder. Natasha Halliwell said her father, who is beginning a life sentence for the murder of nightclubber Sian O’Callaghan, should 'do the right thing' and 'tell the truth' over the murder of missing prostitute Rebecca Godden. 'He needs to give the other family closure as well and give them the justice they need for their daughter,' she told ITV Daybreak. Ms Halliwell said she had received letters from her father but she has not replied to them. She said he had urged her to change her name a number of times. 'We have had quite a few letters that have said ‘Sorry for putting you all through this’ and things like this,' she said. She added: 'As much as I want to hate him, I can’t. I pity him and I do feel sorry for him and I hate what he has done but I can’t hate him.' Investigation: Police search woods near Uffington, Oxfordshire, where Sian O'Callaghan's body was found . The suspension of the senior detective who persuaded Halliwell to lead him to his victims’ bodies is worrying, his supporters say. Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher was suspended on full pay three weeks ago and is being probed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over a blunder during the case. Despite the detective persuading Halliwell to lead him to the graves of two victims, he failed to read him his rights - which meant the killer's confession of murdering Miss Goddard was inadmissible in court. But former Metropolitan Police detective chief inspector Colin Sutton told the Daily Telegraph that DS Fulcher made  reasonable judgments 'in a dynamic and fast moving situation’. And Home Affairs Committee chair Keith Vaz (pictured) said the case could prompt a reform of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, as policing has ‘changed enormously’ in 28 years. Meanwhile Police Superintendents’ Association president Derek Barnett told the Telegraph police officers are expected to ‘prioritise the protection of life as the first and foremost consideration’.","Taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, 48, of Swindon, jailed for 25 years last week for stabbing office worker Sian O'Callaghan, 22, in March 2011 .

Girlfriend blacked out: Amateur rugby prop Benjamin Blake admitted causing actual harm to his girlfriend Tanya Trevelyn . An amateur rugby prop who beat his girlfriend so badly she blacked out had raised money for a domestic violence charity just days before his court case. Benjamin Blake, 20, allegedly tried to strangle Tanya Trevelyn, 40, and after admitting at Exeter Crown Court that he caused her so much pain she blacked out, a custodial sentence has been ‘demanded’ by the judge. The six-foot prop appeared in court just days after he played in a head-to-head charity match between police officers and fire fighters at the Tiverton Rugby Club, Devon where he signed up last month. The game was raising funds for Stop Abuse for Everyone, a charity dedicated to the fight against domestic violence. Recorder Brian Lett, QC, told Blake of Tiverton, Devon that even the parts of the assault which he had admitted to were so serious that an immediate jail sentence was inevitable. Blake admitted causing actual harm, common assault and criminal damage. Mr Lett said there was also a danger that pressure may be put on the victim, who is now due to give evidence, at a special hearing later this month. He said: ‘On the facts admitted a custodial sentence is demanded.’ Blake has been remanded in custody pending a hearing. David Bowen, prosecuting, said all the allegations arose from the same incident in which there was a prolonged and sustained assault. He said: ‘There is a list of injuries . and there were 17 different elements of the assault including biting . of the cheek and two instances of strangulation. Charity match: Just days before Blake appeared in court he played in a head-to-head charity match between police officers and fire fighters at the Tiverton Rugby Club (pictured) Jail inevitable: Recorder Brian Lett, QC, told Blake at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) that even what he admitted to 'demanded' a custodial sentence . ‘The most serious is an allegation which he denies of pulling her legs apart and kicking her between the legs. ‘We say the cumulative effect is to increase the gravity of the offence.’ Warren Robinson, defending, said Blake disputes aiming a deliberate kick to the groin and trying to strangle his partner, but accepts his assault caused her to lose consciousness.

Have you ever had a lovely dinner party ruined when an unwanted, uninvited dinner guest turns up? Well, these angry lions have - they were enjoying a delicious meal of antelope steak on the banks of a river in Zambia when, all of a sudden, a crocodile turned up and tried to sneak a bite to eat. The lions are captured with an all-too-human stunned look of surprise on their faces when they look up from their feast and find a crafty additional mouth at the table. Double take: The lions look by turns angry, shocked and bemused by their unexpected dinner guest - who just wanted a helping of antelope to himself . The fearless Nile crocodile - known as charmingly enough as 'Fred' to residents of South Luangwa, Zambia - risked taking on two fearsome adult females who were feeding their cubs. But as this remarkable video and pictures show Fred had no qualms about wandering over to try his luck and steal a chunk of an impala - an African antelope - the lionesses had just killed. It takes the big cats a few moments to realise Fred is coming towards them and at one stage it looks like he might succeed as he opens his massive jaws. On the approach: The crafty and apparently fearless three-metre crocodile makes the sneaky crawl to the dinner table . Closer still: You can almost feel the crocodile's hunger as he opens his jaws wide and looks at the scene . You can see how engrossed they are: There's almost no room at the table as the lions devour their prey - but the croc will find a way . The lion cubs wisely scatter to avoid themselves becoming a meal, and for a second it looks like Fred has the upper hand. But the huge lioness mothers decide . enough is enough and spurred on, both by anger at the intruder and the . instinct to protect their young, they begin to claw and bite Fred until . he decides it's time to go. Almost as quickly as it started the . titanic struggle is over, and Fred runs through the grass back to the . safety of the river at the South Luangwa, Zambia. Get out of here! The lions are stunned by the sneak attack, and with a roar they tell the crocodile to back off - and the petty thief makes a break for it . 'And don't come back!': The mood of the meal is ruined, with the lioness staring at the interloper who ruined their meal . Not happy: The lions make sure the crocodile - known as Fred - does not make another attempt, walking him away from the table . Photographer and bushcamp manager Oli . Dreike, 34, from The Bushcamp Company, was just 20 metres away in his . tent when the action unfolded. He said: 'As the Luangwa Valley heats . up towards the end of September it's best to wake up early if you want . get things done and avoid the heat of the day. 'What I was not expecting, as I woke up at 5.30am that morning, was to witness a clash of the titans metres away from my tent. 'I just washing my face, when the . waiter came rushing over to my tent calling 'bwana, bwana come quick if . you want to see the lions hunting. 'I pulled on some clothes and dashed . over to the dining area, where he had been preparing breakfast, to see a . lioness and three cubs out on the plain in front of camp.' Oli said the lion pride were . well-known to local conservation researchers the Zambia Carnivore . Programme and were lead by a male lion dubbed 'Scarface' and a scar on . his face he ironically received in a crocodile attack. And just to make sure, the lionness roars her disapproval: It looks like the aggressive animals took a few seconds to come to their senses following the rude interruption . Oli said: 'I ran back to my tent to . get my camera, to find one of the lionesses crouching in wait on the . other side of a small, spring fed channel not 20 metres from my tent. 'Having grabbed my camera and tripod, we both sat in wait, while a nearby group of impala started making alarm calls. 'Then, suddenly out of the tall . grass, came bounding her pride mate, sending the impala into a panic and . one right into the claws of the other lioness, right in front of me. 'The rest of the pride rushed in to start feeding on the impala, a small meal for seven hungry mouths. 'But the cats were so engrossed in . their meal, that it took them a while to realise that they had an . uninvited table guest the huge crocodile that lives in the channel that . runs through camp had smelt it's opportunity and decided to try it's . luck at grabbing a piece of the action. 'The lionesses seemed to be . protecting the kill as well as their cubs, although the croc does seem . to have gotten away with a small chunk of meat. This battle of the titans was a very . noisy affair, all going on some 15 metres away, with nothing between me . and the action, but a narrow stream.
