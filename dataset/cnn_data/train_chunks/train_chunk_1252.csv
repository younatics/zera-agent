"A woman thought to be Iranian dared to take off her head scarf while dancing in a YouTube video. Onlookers can be heard commenting and clapping in the background as she takes out her hair and dances on top of a car, Fox News noted. The news channel reported that it has not been confirmed if the woman is actually from Iran, where women are required by law to wear head coverings, called hijabs - but if true, her safety may be at risk. Scroll down for video . Dance: The woman, who may be Iranian, is seen dancing and taking off her hijab in the popular video . Carefree: After her hijab is removed, the woman continues to dance and toss her hair . She later tosses her hair in the wind and she continues to move her hands and shake her hips. The video appears to be filmed in a desert. A small handful of English-language Twitter users have praised the woman. Tweets included 'This woman is my soul sister!!!' 'Werk it, girl!!' and 'U go girl.' Other Twitter users called the woman 'brave.' Explaining the video's popularity, Krista Nassi, an artist, told Fox News 'People are always interested in seeing the forbidden.' Nassi, who is Iranian, cited the Iranian government and also said 'The work I do there is completely different from what I do [in Los Angeles].' In May, The Daily Dot reported that Iranian women were posting selfies on social media without their hijabs and using #mystealthyfreedom as a hashtag. Earlier this summer, Iranians were arrested and later freed after they were taped dancing to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams, Fox pointed out.

"England captain Wayne Rooney was in buoyant mood as he linked up with the rest of the squad for the first time since being named captain. The 28-year-old was named as Steven Gerrard's successor last week, which would have topped off a exciting few weeks for the Manchester United forward, after just recently being made captain for his club side. Just 10 outfield players were deemed fit enough to take part in England's first training session since their disappointing World Cup campaign.

"A Somali-American who was killed fighting for ISIS in Syria cleaned jetliners for Delta Airlines before he left the United States to fight for the Islamic terrorist group, it has been revealed. Abdirahmaan Muhumed, 29, had security clearances that granted him special access to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in his job with Delta Global Services, KMSP-TV reports. Muhumed left Minneapolis and his nine children late last year to fight for ISIS, which is responsible for beheading two American journalists and slaughtering thousands of innocent civilians as its brutal fighters took control of large swaths of Syria and northern Iraq. Scroll down for video . Fight or flight: Abdirahmaan Muhumed, pictured here in Syria, had special access to planes and the tarmac at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport before he joined the brutal terrorist group ISIS . Muhumed worked for Delta Global Services, which cleans and re-stocks Delta planes, according to KMSP-TV . Recently, ISIS has offered direct threats to America, posting pictures of the White House and other U.S. landmarks and saying ominously: 'We are in your state, we are in your cities, we are in your streets.' KMSP reports that multiple sources have revealed that Muhuhmed had unfettered access to jetliners at the airport, which handles 90,000 passengers a day. He also had access to the tarmac and special security clearance to other parts of the airport. One of the last photos of Muhumed is a propaganda picture circulated on social media that shows him standing on a hill in Syria and holding an AK-47 rifle in the air. KMSP reported that it appears Muhumed had no criminal record in the United States that would have prevented him from getting a job at the airport. Delta Airlines did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. Muhumed, 29, left behind his nine children to fight with the brutal terrorist group, which is attracting fighters from around the world with its social media campaign . Two weeks ago, Muhumed's family was sent a picture of his body, confirming he had died.  He is the second American killed fighting for ISIS. Last week, it emerged that Douglas McArthur McCain, who was also from Minneapolis, had been killed after taking up arms with the terrorist group. At least 15 men and one woman from Minneapolis have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, according to authorities. Most of the fighters are from the city's large Somali refugee population. On Tuesday, a British ISIS fighter beheaded Steven Sotloff, the second American journalist killed in two weeks. The group vowed to kill more Americans if the U.S. government doesn't end its campaign of bombing ISIS targets in Iraq.","Abdirahmaan Muhumed, 29, had security clearances that granted him special access to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport .

"Attack: Tahmoor Hussain, now 21, from Nelson, Lancashire has been jailed for 32 months for sexually assaulting a 28-year-old woman after a night out on New Year's Eve . A 19-year-old sex attacker answered his mobile phone while molesting a terrified woman and casually told the caller he would ring back in 15 minutes, a court heard. Tahmoor Hussain, now 21, had just pushed his 28-year old victim to the ground before getting on top of her, kissing her, biting her lip and threatening to kill her. As the woman lay struggling on a grass verge, Hussain's mobile rang and he answered it, Burnley Crown Court heard. After hanging up, Hussain grabbed his victim again and tried to frogmarch her away. She only escaped when he began to return the call. The court heard the horrific attack took place on New Year's Eve 2010 after the victim had been out with a friend in Burnley. She was heading home alone at about . 7pm when she saw Hussain,  of Nelson, Lancashire, staggering and . weaving around on the pavement. As she passed him he told her she had a 'nice bottom' and asked her if she was on her own. She turned round, gestured towards him and ran off. Amanda Johnson, prosecuting, said Hussain then approached the victim and asked for her telephone number. Miss Johnson said: 'She said she didn’t have one but he put out his hand to stop her walking past. He asked again for her number and suddenly began to kiss her. 'The defendant moved towards the woman, she moved back and he pushed her to the ground. He then got on top of her, held her down, kissed her, said he was going to kill her, repeated he would kill her, kissed her again and bit her lip. 'He asked her to go home with him, the victim was so scared she said ""yes"", and the defendant kissed her and bit her lip once again. He continued to kiss her and then put his hand inside her knickers and committed a sex act. Location: The victim had been walking near Gannow Top when Hussain pounced . Judgement: Before sentencing Hussain at Burnley Crown Court, Judge Beverley Lunt said the victim would 'be haunted by what happened for a long time' Miss Johnson added the woman was still lying on the ground, frightened. 'The . defendant told the woman, ""Get up, you’re going home,"" pulled her to . her feet and the victim said she was not going with him and started to . scream,' Miss Johnson said. 'The . defendant dared her to call 999 and offered her his phone. She ran away . and he pursued her, chasing her through the underpass. The victim got . 50 metres and could not run any further.' The prosecutor said the defendant told the woman he loved her, she screamed for him to leave her alone, he grabbed her, she pushed him away and she fled when he began to make a phone call. Horror: Judge Lunt made reference to the act being out of character for Hussain but said it could not diminish the 'full horror of the experience for your victim' The woman, who did not contact police immediately but told a friend and indicated she was scared, picked Hussain out of a video identity parade. Hussain's mobile phone records put him at the location of the assault on that day. CCTV footage from the underpass was analysed and compared with the defendant. Twelve points of similarity on his body were found. When he was questioned by police, Hussain claimed he had been in Nelson at the time, didn’t provide the code for his mobile phone and refused to answer any more questions. Defending, Michael Murray, said Hussain had been 'intoxicated to a very high level.' 'This awful offence was out of character for him and there are no signs that it will ever be repeated in the future. He can’t, of course, say that nothing will ever happen, but there are no signs that it will.' But sentencing, Judge Beverley Lunt said the incident was obviously terrifying for the victim and involved a level of violence. 'The complainant must have suffered some psychological trauma and would be haunted by what happened for a long time,' she added. 'This was not a minor sexual assault. It was a serious sexual assault. You have little or no memory of it because you were so drunk. Your victim was not that fortunate.' Judge Lunt said Hussain had been very, very drunk and his conduct was clearly out of character for him. But added: 'None of that can possibly, possibly, diminish the full horror of the experience for your victim.' Hussain admitted assault by penetration and was jailed for 32 months. He was put on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.","Tahmoor Hussain had been 'intoxicated to a very high level' when he attacked the woman on New Year's Eve .

"A mother has been jailed for up to 30 years for burning her son's penis and nipples off with a lighter. The 19-year-old was repeatedly tortured and then coerced to lie that his wounds were self-inflicted. He had three alleged abusers, including his own mother. At her plea and sentencing hearing in Merrimack County Superior Court, in New Hampshire, US, he described in detail how she brutally abused him in the family's Penacook home. Jailed: Christine Gelineau, 53, who pleaded guilty to first-degree assault and witness tampering for a gruesome attack on her son . ‘Dear ex-Mother,’ he began, reading from a statement as the woman, Christine Gelineau, sat sobbing nearby in an orange prison jumpsuit. ‘What you did to me is unforgivable. You beat me, starved me, almost chopped my penis off, threw my clothes away, wouldn't let me bathe. You almost killed me by having me take three (antidepressants) and two muscle-relaxers. ‘Now that I know you're a complete criminal and only wanted me dead so you could go back to your old life. You won't be able to attend my graduation or see me go on to college, so I wish you goodbye. I hope you realize you have lost everything you had.’ Gelineau, 53, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault and witness tampering. As part of a plea bargain, she was sentenced to nine to 30 years in state prison - a stiffer punishment than she would have normally faced because of a state statute prohibiting exceptional cruelty in assault cases, the local paper reports. Assistant county prosecutor George Waldron said the man suffered permanent nerve damage in his penis when Gelineau burned it with a lighter, sometime between April 10 and 14. ‘What she did alone was one of the most horrible things I've seen,’ Waldron said after the hearing. According to an affidavit in the case, Gelineau had admitted to detectives that she burned the tip of her son's penis, but she said she did so only after he threatened to have sex with her. In response, she said she put gloves on because she thought her son was ‘dirty,’ grabbed and twisted his penis and then held a lighter to it for several seconds, as he screamed in pain. Another suspect, however, told detectives that Gelineau burned the penis after first pressuring her son to eat human faeces. Gelineau threatened to burn his genitals if he refused, the suspect, Daniel ‘Tyler’ Cantrell, told detectives. When the man complied, Gelineau burned it anyway, he said, according to the affidavit. Suspect: Daniel ¿Tyler¿ Cantrell is scheduled to stand trial next month on multiple felony charges in the case . Cantrell, who is 20 and scheduled to stand trial next month on multiple felony charges in the case, admitted to detectives that he helped Gelineau carry out the abuse, kicking the victim into a bedroom, tying him down and walking away as Gelineau pulled his pants down, the affidavit states. Officials at Concord Hospital later determined that the man, who was 18 at the time, suffered second- and third-degree burns from the incident. Gelineau also allegedly kneed her son in his face and struck him repeatedly in the stomach with a pen, but those charges were dropped as part of the plea bargain. Though it's unclear what prompted the abuse, prosecutors said they believe it had something to do with the victim, who is mentally challenged, no longer receiving financial assistance from the government because he wasn't enrolled in school at the time. When asked by Judge Richard McNamara for a more definitive motive, Waldron seemed at a loss.‘Punishment,’ he said, shrugging his shoulders. 'He [the son] has a lot to deal with and it's going to be a long recovery period' - County Attorney Scott Murray . Cantrell is accused of a litany of other related abuses dating back to March, which include strangling the victim with a scarf, punching him in the face, burning off his nipples with a lighter, pressing a lit cigarette onto the back of his head and twisting his ankle until it cracked. The victim's 29-year-old cousin, Amy Nason, also allegedly pressured him to ingest urine, worms and dish soap. She is scheduled for a plea and sentencing hearing in two weeks. The police first learned of the incidents in April from the state Division for Children, Youth and Families, which had been contacted by the parents of a 12-year-old girl who said she witnessed abuse while visiting Nason's daughter at the home. Detectives initially interviewed the victim and Cantrell together, at which time the victim claimed his wounds were self-inflicted. In a subsequent interview, though, the victim contradicted parts of his earlier account and said that all three defendants had carried out the abuse. Cantrell and Nason have also been charged with witness tampering. Statement: At Merrimack Superior Court (pictured) the son said what happened to him was unforgivable . Neighbors said the family moved to Concord from Massachusetts a few months before the abuse occurred. They met Cantrell in Tennessee during a road trip, Cantrell's mother has said. The victim is now living with an aunt and uncle in a, and is back in school. ‘He's doing very well,’ County Attorney Scott Murray said after the hearing. ‘But obviously he has a lot to deal with, and it's going to be a long recovery period.’ He remained composed as he read his handwritten statement in court, never looking at his mother as he ticked through a list of gruesome abuses. When he finished, he returned to his seat and buried his head in a relative's arms, the sound of his mother's sobs echoing in the background. After a few seconds, he began crying himself.","Christine Gelineau from Concord, Massachusetts, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault .

"Manchester United have 'lost the way a little bit' by offloading homegrown Danny Welbeck to Premier League rivals Arsenal and spending extravagantly to bring in players like Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, according to former assistant manager Mike Phelan. England striker Welbeck, a product of United's Academy who scored 29 goals in 142 first-team appearances, was sold to Arsenal on transfer deadline day on Monday. While Welbeck headed to London, United were busy splashing the cash by sealing deals for Dutch utility player Daley Blind and Colombia striker Falcao, who has joined on a season-long loan. VIDEO Scroll down for Radamel Falcao has moved to Manchester United from Monaco . Big money signing: Manchester United left it late to sign Radamel Falcao on deadline day . United, yet to win in the Premier League under new manager Louis Van Gaal and with no European football at Old Trafford, have spent big in a bid to quickly get back on track following their seventh place finish last season. Van Gaal's summer spending spree surpassed £150million, with a British transfer record of £59.7m pounds paid to lure Di Maria from Real Madrid. United also signed Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcus Rojo. Phelan suggested it showed a lack of faith in United's youth system, renowned in the past for its production line of world-class talent like David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Star signing: Angel di Maria joined Manchester United from Real Madrid for £59.7m . 'Interesting how things have changed at Manchester United now. A good young kid (Welbeck) coming through - part of the academy system - and they've finally decided now that might not be the way to go so they've moved him on,' Phelan, Alex Ferguson's right-hand man at Old Trafford between 2008 and 2013, told BBC Radio 5 Live. 'Obviously there is more and more money now in the game, looking further and further afield for players but probably they have lost the way of Manchester United a little bit in the fact that now rather than produce it may be the case where they're buying in. Spanish star: Ander Herrera joined United from Athletic Bilbao in the summer . 'One of the issues of the Premier League at the moment, and with English football at the moment, is getting them on to the football field, promoting them that way and waiting for those opportunities, providing the time and that hasn't happened.' Phelan said United's big spending now reflected a philosophy of wanting instant success under Van Gaal after the former champions stagnated under Ferguson's successor David Moyes. Concerns: Mike Phelan says Manchester United have lost their way a little bit . 'It's success now, and not later. In Danny's case. He's had a good run at it, he's come through the system... there's other kids there now in the system who will hopefully get a chance but there's been a lot of cash splashed out in the transfer window and I'm sure that will only get worse.' Former United youth team coach Eric Harrison has also shared his concern over the Red Devils' big spending this summer. He told the Manchester Evening News: 'I am very concerned to be honest. 'I cannot believe Danny Welbeck has gone. Okay he might not have been a prolific goalscorer but his work rate and effort was undeniable. 'There was a place for him and I am not too pleased he’s gone to Arsenal. It is sending out the wrong message when local home grown players like that are leaving.'","Manchester United spent over £150m on new signings this summer transfer window .

"U.S. drone strikes are believed to have killed the leader of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, who ordered the massacre at a Kenyan shopping mall last year that killed 67 people. U.S. Intelligence officials believe Ahmed Abdi Godane was traveling in a two-car convoy Monday night near al-Shabab's main base in Barawe when American drone aircraft hit the vehicles with missiles. Six people were killed in the attack and Somali authorities say they think Godane is among the dead - though the Pentagon said it is still awaiting confirmation. Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida and became the most high-profile terrorist group in Africa. Scroll down for video . Ahmed Abdi Godane is believed one of six people killed when a drone fired on his two-car convoy in Somalia on Monday night, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the death . Dangerous as ever: Even though al-Shabab fighters have been kicked out of the capital of Mogadishu, they have continued attacking targets throughout Africa . Under Godane's orders, the group attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people a year ago this month. The group was also responsible for a suicide bombing at a World Cup watching party in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010 that left 74 dead and 70 injured. The U.S. has targeted planners of the bloody Westgate assault, in which four Britons and two Canadians were killed. A month after the attack, Navy SEALs landed at al-Shabab's headquarters in Barawe and attempted to capture another mastermind behind the attack. In 2012, the U.S. government put a $7million price on Godane's head - though he has escaped justice until now. A witness to Monday's airstrike in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions caused by the missile. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake' as the al-Shabab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told The Associated Press. 'There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,' Nor said. U.S. commanders said they are waiting to determine the outcome of Monday's attack. 'U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. After the U.S. strike in a forest near Sablale district south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said. Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, last year that claimed 67 lives in Kenya. He also forged the groups alliance with al-Qaeda . 'Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.' The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years. A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert. The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked on Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members had attempted to free other extremists held there. Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison. Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the mall attack was carried out in retaliation for the West's support for Kenya's Somalia intervention and the 'interest of their oil companies.' Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011. Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting.","Ahmed Abdi Godane is the spiritual leader of al-Shabab .

"A Florida teen has reeled in what could be a record for largest swordfish ever caught in the area. Adam Satter, 17, is an avid fisherman but was only on his second swordfishing trip when he set sail his father on Labor Day.

According to WFLA, the fish was so big it had to be towed into a dock because it wouldn't fit inside the boat. The 693-pound fish measured 14-feet long. The fish was so big, in fact, that at first Adam didn't think it was a fish at all. 'Came up twice. All we saw was a big shadow — thought it might have been a big shark,' the North Palm Beach teen told WPTV. Incredible: Adam was 30 miles off the coast of Jupiter, Florida when he made the incredible catch . Big as a shark: Before he caught it, Adam thought it was a shark swimming near the boat . After Adam and his dad weighed the whopping fish for official purposes, they generously gave the valuable meat away to friends at the dock. They kept just the swordfish's impressive bill for themselves. Adam and his dad told reporters they've submitted the catch in the hopes it will be deemed a record.

"Meet the cheeky cat who must think he’s lost all his nine lives and gone to feline heaven. A ginger-and-white tom - nicknamed ‘Graham’ – has adopted a giant pet shop stuffed with toys, food and fish, as his second home. For the past few months he's been visiting the Pets at Home store in Boston, Lincolnshire, every day – even waiting outside for the doors to open at 9am. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Every day's a purr-fect day for Graham: He's pictured here trying to catch a fish at the Boston Pets at Home store . Curious: Graham is very drawn to the rodent section of the store . A video filmed by staff shows Graham sprawled on the ground in front of the shop's automatic doors as he waits to be let in. Once inside, he wanders over to the till enclosure and opens the staff gate with his paw before jumping on the counter. Graham can also be seen attempting to . claw his way - unsuccessfully - into a rodent enclosure and staring . transfixed at a goldfish tank. Loyal: Graham turns up to the pet store every day - and gleefully wanders the aisles . Patient: Graham waits outside the doors before opening time . No paws-ing: Graham trots straight in at 9am . Deputy manager Vicky Coker said: ‘Sometimes he sits on the mat and greets customers as they come in.’ As for the pets for sale, staff insist that he doesn’t scare them at all. George Tarbox, 19, who’s worked at the store for five months, said: 'Curiously enough, the animals here don’t react to him. They’re not scared at all. Anyway, they’re protected by a plastic screen, so he doesn’t cause any harm. That’s why we like him. He likes to sit and watch the rodents, dragons and fish we have in store. Cat's nice: The staff at Pets at Home enjoy fussing Graham . Comfort: The till enclosure is a favourite spot for Graham . ‘Initially we discouraged him from coming in, but he kept coming back. ‘We thought it wouldn't be very good to keep shooing him out as pets are always welcome here - although they're usually on a lead when they come in.’ Graham spends hours at a time at the store and staff feed him the occasional treat to stop him thieving products that are for sale and play with him using toys that won’t be sold. Window shopping: Graham spends hours at a time at the store and gets to play with toys - but only the ones that aren't for sale . And so far their tactics are working. Mr Tarbox added: ‘We have caught him chewing on a packet of cat food before, but he's generally no trouble. ‘He's become a bit of a celebrity too as we often have customers asking where he is. ‘The kids, especially, love him. He’s a big draw for them.' Mr Tarbox says he’s claimed ownership of Graham because he named him – but believes he does have an owner, as he has a collar. Staff have no idea who it is, though. Graham never spends the night at the store because it has a motion-activated alarm that he would set off. Instead, he's put outside at the end of the day and left to find his way home to his owner, whoever it is. 'We always say to him ""see you tomorrow,"" said Mr Tarbox. 'Because we know he'll be back.' Graham's loyalty isn't just appreciated by the Boston store's customers and staff - it's been recognised by the Pets at Home head office. He's been awarded 'Customer of the Year', with the prestigious title bestowed upon him in a ceremony on Friday. He received a certificate, a new gold collar and a name tag engraved with his new title. Pets at Home are now urging Graham’s owners to come forward so that they can be rewarded for their loyalty with a privilege card and be given a tour of the store that Graham knows only too well.

"Thomas Hitzlsperger says it would have been almost impossible for him to come out as gay had he still been playing professionally. The former Aston Villa midfielder, who retired from football back in January, believes that he couldn't of come out as homosexual during his time as a player because of the media. He told the Metro in a Q & A: 'I did so many interviews and it took up all of my time so it would have been difficult to go back into training as if nothing had happened.

'For me it would have been almost impossible had I still been playing – not because of the fans or the other players, but because of the media.' The 32-year-old is an ardent supporter of the Stonewall campaign – a lesbian, gay and bisexual rights charity in the UK – which helps tackle homophobia in football. And the former Germany international says players should show their support to the campaign this weekend by wearing rainbow laces. Respect: Hitzlsperger spent short spells at Everton and West Ham, as well as four years at Aston Villa . He added: 'It would show there is no place for prejudice in football. Last year Everton, one of my former clubs, wore the laces which was great. 'Some players may not want to because of their personal beliefs, and we must respect that, but it is great to see so many players and clubs getting involved.' As well as Hitzlsperger a number of Arsenal players have pledged their support to the rainbow laces campaign, including England duo Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, as well as QPR midfielder Joey Barton.","The former Aston Villa and West Ham midfielder says he couldn't have come out gay when he was playing professionally .

"Freddie Selby, five, has a rare heart condition and was given just given six months. But three and a half years later he is still battling on . A young boy who doctors said would die within six months because of a rare heart condition has defied the odds for over three years. Freddie Selby was born with a condition which affects his heart's valves and surgeons said his condition was too serious to operate on.

Doctors told mum Kirsty, 40, that they could not operate on Freddie and he would die within months.

"Frank Lampard wants to stay with Manchester City for the rest of the season and fight Chelsea for the Barclays Premier League title. Lampard, who is scheduled to return to parent club New York City next month to start preparing for life in the MLS, came off the bench to score City’s second against Southampton. Ten-man City - who beat Ronaldo Koeman’s side 3-0 at St Mary’s - are now within six points of Chelsea following a dramatic weekend. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . The Manchester City team celebrate with Frank Lampard after he scored their second goal of the day . Lampard fires past Fraser Forster in the Southampton goal to put Man City 2-0 up on Sunday . Manuel Pellegrini is also in favour of Lampard, who is 36, remaining with City until the end of the season, but the complication is the start of the MLS in March. He said: ‘We will sit down in December and decide what happens. He is a top professional.’ The reigning champions reduced the gap at the top of the table to six points after goals from Yaya Toure, Lampard and left-back Gael Glichy. Eliaquim Mangala was sent off for two bookings. Pellegrini said: ‘We have to play 25 games more and it’s a lot of points. No one knows what happens in the future. ‘In one week, you can change things. Chelsea are playing very well, but let’s see what happens in the future. We just have to work on us. ‘There are many things we can complain about this year, such as the team conceding too many goals and not scoring as many as last season, but the only thing we cannot complain about is the spirit, the personality and ambition of this squad.’ Gael Clichy scored his first goal for Manchester City with a late effort into the roof of the net . Man City goalkeeper Joe Hart (right) congratulates Clichy after his maiden goal for the club . Despite City’s sluggish start to the season Pellegrini maintains that the champions are in the mood to hunt down Chelsea over Christmas. On Wednesday Pellegrini’s side travel to Sunderland - who drew with Chelsea on Saturday at the Stadium of Light - and Chelsea face Tottenham at Stamford Bridge. Mangala will be suspended and Vincent Kompany is a doubt after being taken off with a hamstring injury. But Pellegrini said: ‘I am very pleased because we beat a strong Southampton team. Today was not a scoreline they deserved because they are a strong team, they defend well, so to beat them 3-0 was very good.’ Pellegrini even overlooked the dreadful decision by referee Mike Jones to caution Sergio Aguero for diving when he was clearly fouled inside the area by Southampton captain Jose Fonte. Lampard celebrates his fifth goal for the club with Aguero, after a typical finish from the edge of the box . Frank Lampard, on as a substitute, received James Milner's centre to strike from 20 yards past Forster . He added: ‘I thought it was a penalty but I’m not the referee. One thing I was sure was Sergio never dived. He doesn’t try to cheat the referee. He tries to support the team, so he wouldn’t have done it that way. It’s not frustrating and it’s not important what happened. The referee made the mistake.’ Pellegrini also accepted that Mangala deserved to be sent off. He was given a yellow card in the first half when he brought down Dusan Tadic and sent off when Toure’s mistake forced him to bring down Shane Long. Pellegrini: ‘It was the correct decision. They were fouls. But with 10 men we tried to score another goal. ‘Mangala played very well. It was an unnecessary foul. It was not Mangala who lost the ball. He and Kompany played very well.’ Referee Mike Jones booked Aguero as Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri go to remonstrate with the official . Southampton defender Fonte makes clear contact with Aguero as the Argentine falls to the ground in the box . Southampton were well beaten. Koeman, who was forced into a change at half-time because of an injury to midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, has big tests at Arsenal and at home to Manchester United in their next two games. Koeman said: ‘We don’t have 24 players like they have to change in the second half. We know that. ‘But if you do these kind of mistakes – the first goal, maybe it was a bit unlucky – it was not good enough. You have to be good to have a good chance for a point or three points. ‘We will write this off because we didn’t show something different. But if we are the fifth in the league, still we are very happy. ‘On Wednesday we will get a new opportunity to show the qualities. Okay, there’s no time to be disappointed. We did too many mistakes and we were punished for that, because they have a very strong team and very good players. We knew that before. We saw it today. ‘Chelsea and Man City are the two strongest teams in the Premier League and you have to be good to have a good result agianst them.

"A pharmacist who oversaw the sterile clean rooms at a Massachusetts facility responsible for a deadly meningitis outbreak was arrested today as he was about to board a flight for Hong Kong. Glenn Adam Chin, 46, a former supervisory pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center, didn't properly sterilize or test equipment and concealed the unsafe practices, federal investigators said. The pharmacy, which custom-mixed medications in bulk, has been blamed for a 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis that killed 64 people. Glenn Adam Chin, 46, who was supervisory pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center responsible for the 2012 deadly meningitis outbreak, was arrested Thursday . New England Compounding Center (NECC), a producer of the steroid methylprednisolone acetate, is seen in Framingham, Massachusetts October 8, 2012 . About 750 people in 20 states developed meningitis — an inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord — or other infections. Michigan, Tennessee and Indiana were hit the hardest. Mr Chin, from Canton, was arrested at Logan International Airport. He was charged with one count of mail fraud, but federal prosecutors said it is part of a larger criminal investigation of Chin and others. He is the first person to be charged in the inquiry. Chin's attorney, Paul Shaw, said his client was at the airport with his family because he planned to attend a wedding in his wife's native Hong Kong, not to flee the country. He said Chin would plead not guilty. 'This was a publicity stunt,' Shaw said of the arrest. Prosecutors said Chin supervised the clean rooms and was involved in compounding the contaminated methylprednisolone acetate, or MPA, that caused the outbreak. An affidavit filed in US District Court alleges that Chin participated in a scheme to fraudulently cause one lot of MPA to be labeled as injectable, meaning that it was sterile and fit for human use. The lot was shipped to Michigan Pain Specialists in Brighton, Michigan. In the nick of time: Chin, 46, was taken into custody at Logan International Airport in Boston just before he boarded a flight to Hong Kong . Chin is accused of failing to sterilize or test equipment at the facility, pictured here in 2012, and fraudulently labeling MPA steroids manufactured in moldy rooms as safe for injection . Shuttered: The New England Compounding Center gave up its license and filed for bankruptcy protection over meningitis lawsuits . After receiving the drug, Michigan Pain Specialists doctors injected it into patients, believing it to be safe. As a result, 217 patients contracted fungal meningitis, and 15 of them died, according to the affidavit. In the affidavit, a special agent with the Food and Drug Administration said Chin used numerous unsafe practices while producing the medication, including improper sterilization and improper testing. Agent Benedict Celso said that Chin, in order to conceal the unsafe practices, 'instructed pharmacy technicians to mislabel medication to indicate it was properly sterilized and tested.' Celso also said the compounding center failed to properly sterilize and maintain its clean rooms. He said Chin instructed pharmacy technicians to 'fraudulently complete cleaning logs' at the end of the month 'purporting to show the rooms were properly cleaned and maintained when in fact they had not been.' He said the pharmacy's own testing showed the repeated presence of bacteria and mold within its clean rooms on a weekly basis throughout 2012. A woman whose husband contracted meningitis after getting a tainted injection at the Michigan clinic welcomed the criminal charge. Bacteria: Meningitis is a potentially deadly inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord . 'They should take every one of them and put the same contaminated injection in their back,' said Iona 'Nell' Rye, of Maybee, Michigan. She said her 74-year-old husband, Alfred, had been in excellent health before he received the injection in August 2012. He has recovered but still has some residual effects, she said. 'He doesn't have the same strength. He's off balance,' she said. The New England Compounding Center, based in Framingham, just west of Boston, gave up its license and filed for bankruptcy protection after it was flooded with hundreds of lawsuits from people who received tainted steroid injections. Attorneys for its creditors late last year announced a preliminary settlement with a victim compensation fund worth more than $100 million. The contaminated medication was discovered in the fall of 2012. Regulators later found a host of potential contaminants at the company's Framingham plant, including standing water, mold, water droplets and dirty equipment.","Glenn Adam Chin, 46, was supervisory pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center responsible for deadly outbreak .

"Maria Shriver cheated on  Arnold Schwarzenegger with his own campaign strategist - flaunting the relationship in front of staffers five years before her husband's affair with the family maid was exposed, a shocking new report claims. Shriver debuted boyfriend Matthew Dowd last month at her cousin Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s wedding - introducing him to the family at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. According to initial reports, the two have been seeing each other for less than a year. However, the New York Post now claims that Shriver and Dowd started their relationship in 2006 when Dowd was a chief strategist for Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial reelection campaign. Schwarzenegger found out, but she continued the relationship anyway, according to the newspaper. Shriver and Schwarzenegger split up in 2011 after it was revealed he had an affair with the family's housekeeper 'Patty' Baena that dated back to 1992 and that they had a teenage son together. The New York Post claims that Maria Shriver had an affair with Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign strategist Matthew Dowd - beginning in 2006. The couple are seen here at Schwarzenegger's swear-in in 2007 . Part of the family: Maria Shriver (center) introduced boyfriend Matthew Dowd (right) to the Kennedys at her cousin Bobby Jr's (second from left) wedding to Cheryl Hines (left) The divorce hasn't been finalized, but the pair have been living apart since Schwarzenegger went public with his love child. Dowd, now a political analyst for ABC News, denied having an affair with Shriver in 2006 - and told the Post that they were just 'good friends' at that time. Neither Dowd nor representatives for Shriver or Schwarzenegger responded to requests for comment from MailOnline. Former Schwarzenegger's campaign staffers are now coming forward to expose Shriver's dalliances with Dowd, according to the Post. 'There was a lot of flirtation. They frequently spent time alone, and Arnold was rarely, if ever, around when they were together,' one staffer told the newspaper. 'She had a unique banter with him and lit up when he was around. He was comfortable poking fun at her, and she would slap him teasingly.' The whole clan: Maria and Matthew posed for a picture with the whole Shriver clan. Maria is the niece of JFK and RFK . The pair often spent time alone together after meetings and took long walks, according to the Post. When Schwarzenegger found out about the relationship, he removed Dowd from his inner-circle. The governor and Shriver fought about it constantly on the campaign trail, the newspaper reports. After Schwarzenegger won a second term as California governor, he and Shriver remained together in public - but she continued to see Dowd on the side, the Post claims. A source told the Post that in 2007, she went to see Dowd at the Four Season in New York and that the pair were seen out together in Santa Monica, California. When Schwarzenegger's marriage to Shriver ended, he forbade any of his friends and staffers from publicly talking about Shriver's relationship with Dowd, according to the Post. Dowd made his reputation as one of the mastermind's behind George W. Bush's 2000 and 2004 campaigns and was part of the president's inner circle until he began speaking out against him in 2006. Shriver and Dowd were first spotted in public together last October. Both come from large Irish Catholic families - and both have a history of heartbreak . He's the third of 11 children from a strict Irish Catholic family. He was an altar boy and keeps at least 100 crosses in his rural Texas home. He's been married and divorced twice; his second marriage fell apart after one of his twin infant daughters died in the hospital, according to a 2007 profile piece in the Los Angeles Times. He also worked for Shriver's husband - taking a job on Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial reelection campaign. Shriver, 58, has been dating Dowd, 52, since last fall, according to the Washington Post - although Kennedy's wedding to Cheryl Hines appears to be their first public event together. They both currently work in broadcasting. Dowd is an ABC political analyst and fixture on the Sunday talk shows. Shriver is a special . Shriver - the niece of Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy - was married to Schwarzenegger for 25 years until it was revealed that he had an affair with his maid and had fathered a child with her. She and Schwarzenegger have four children together. Dowd grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of an auto executive father and a school teacher mother. Dowd told the Times his family would have been upper-middle class - if his strict Irish Catholic parents hadn't had 11 children. He was an altar boy and even considered the priesthood - though, he told the Times, he liked girls too much. He has two grown sons with his first wife and a 12-year-old daughter Josephine with his second wife. That marriage ended after his wife gave birth to twin girls in 2002. Josephine survived. Her sister died after two months in the hospital. After he publicly criticized the Bush administration over its handling of gay marriage and the Iraq War, he left politics and moved to a ranch in rural Wimberly, Texas, an hour outside of Austin. A Times reporter described his house as having more than 100 crosses. Above his fireplace, he has the Prayer of St. Francis: 'Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, where this hatred, let me sow love.'","Maria Shriver introduced her  boyfriend Matthew Dowd to her family at cousin Bobby Kennedy's Jr.'s wedding .

"Grisly: Police said Chimboza was chewing flesh at the crime scene . A businessman in Africa has admitted to a savage act of cannibalism – ripping a man’s heart out and eating it ‘to show he was not gay’, while the victim was still alive. Andrew Chimboza, 35, told Cape Town police in a statement that he killed Mbuyiselo Manona, 62, in self-defence at the home of a client in the township of Gugulethu after being insulted. Prosecutor Quawnita Geyer read out the statement during a bail hearing at the Athlone Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town on Wednesday. He said: ‘In your warning statement you say... “I sit upon him and stabbed him on the chest, tore out his heart and took a knife and then sliced his heart and then I ate his heart.” “’The reason for me to eat the unknown guy's heart was to show him that I am not a moffie [gay] and after I finished eating the heart, I realised he was dead.”’ Investigating officer Constable Mphumelelo Yengwa attended the autopsy and reported its horrifying conclusion. According to The Citizen he said: ‘It was conducted by Dr Allie. Dr Allie told me that the heart is not present in the deceased’s body and therefore, when the heart was taken out, he could see that the deceased was still alive.’ Yengwa told the hearing that the officer who arrested Chimboza at the scene found him chewing raw flesh and that Manona's neck had been 'half-eaten'. He added that his chest had a gaping hole in the left side. However, Chimboza, originally from Zimbabwe, is now disputing the veracity of his statement, arguing that it was fabricated after he was assaulted by the police, according to Sowetanlive.com. Chimboza, who runs a window-tinting business, claims that while he did stab Manona to death, he can’t remember taking out the heart and eating it. The brutal attack took place on the evening of June 10. Counter argument: Chimboza, who runs a window-tinting business, now claims that while he did stab Manona to death, he can’t remember taking out the heart and eating it . Chimboza confirmed to the hearing that Manona had called him certain names, that they then fought and that he had stabbed him to death. He said: ‘The way I was continuously stabbing, that must have ripped his heart out. Because I was in a shocked state.’ Geyer retorted: ‘All the witnesses that were there confirm you killed the deceased, you cut out his heart and ate it. They say there was flesh in your teeth and dry blood on your mouth.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Andrew Chimboza, 35, told Cape Town police he had eaten a human heart .

"He's the footballer who hit headlines last year after  reportedly flying a Serbian model out to visit him on a private jet - and has even been hailed the new Ronaldo. And it seems that Neymar Jr really is set to steal Cristiano's heartthrob crown, if his latest fashion campaign is anything to go by. International fashion and lifestyle brand, Police, has signed the 23-year-old to be the face of its new Optical range - and he looks seriously dapper in the campaign imagery. Brazilian footballer Neymar Jr has been unveiled as the face of Police's new Optical range . The brand ambassador, who also fronted the spring/summer 2015 sunglasses campaign, models the 'sleek, key, urban eyewear' and the brand says the style of their new glasses is synonymous with their global brand ambassador. It seems no expense was spared for the FC Barcelona star; industry heavyweight Rankin was called in to shoot the campaign. Starring alongside the heartthrob is Mexican model Daniela de Jesus, who has worked with GUESS?, Vivienne Westwood and Abercrombie. Neymar follows in the footsteps of past Police ambassadors who include Bruce Willis, George Clooney, David Beckham and Antonio Banderas. Neymar Jr, who famously flew a female friend out to see him on a private plane, stars with Mexican model . Daniela de Jesus has worked with GUESS?, Vivienne Westwood and Abercrombie . It was revealed last year that Neymar reportedly sent a private plane for Serbian model Soraja Vucelic to bring her to visit him in the Spanish city of Barcelona. Tabloid Kurir reported that Soraja, 28, and the footballer met last summer in Ibiza and since then she and the Brazilian national football team star have reportedly been chatting frequently via Skype. And it seems things are hotting up after Neymar, whose full name is Neymar da Silva Santos Junior, sent an aeroplane to pick her and her female friend up. According to the newspaper, Soraja allegedly flew to Neymar in Barcelona and stayed there for several days. The paper claims that the couple first agreed she would visit him at the end of October, but then decided they couldn't wait that long and instead he cancelled the tickets and sent a private plane to collect her instead. Watch out, Ronaldo! The 23-year-old last year fronted the brand's sunglasses range . The model later published a photo in Neymar's Barcelona FC jersey in the aeroplane on her Instagram account. Soraja Vucelic became popular in Balkans after participating in their Big Brother show. Since then she has become a pin-up girl for many local men and has huge local fan club. There's no wonder the busty model is a fan of Neymar. The young star has scored 40 goals in 58 matches for Brazil, making him the fifth highest goalscorer for his national team. He's won accolades such as most marketable athlete in the world and last year, The Guardian hailed him as the sixth best player in the world.

"Andrei Arshavin's dramatic 2009 move from Zenit St Petersburg to Arsenal was clinched, agent Jon Smith says, when he put up £1.2million demanded by the Russian club out of his own pocket. Smith relived perhaps the tightest deal in transfer history, that was finally secured with a one-word email eight seconds from the deadline, while a guest on BT Sport on Monday. As one of the duller  transfer deadline days in recent times played out, Smith reached into his extensive vault of football business experience to offer some insight into what was really going behind the scenes  amid the speculation about player moves. Andrei Arshavin's £15million move from Zenit to Arsenal was completed with eight seconds to spare . Arshavin is substituted by Arsene Wenger in 2009 . 'I was involved with Andrei Arshavin. That deal started in the second week in January,' he recalled. 'Funnily enough, the guy at the Russian end was in charge of the Russia national gas company at the time. The previous week he'd cut off the Czech Republic's supply and this week he was talking about football deals.' Smith says discussion were stunted from that point until the deadline was imminent on January 30. 'We got to the 30th of January, and everyone thought we better hurry up here. Then it got really serious,' he said on BT Sport. 'It was snowing. So we flew the player over anyway (Ashavin was in Paris and Smith, with his brother Phil, feared he'd be stranded there). 'It got to the very last day and we were about £1.2million apart with about an hour to go. And it was literally who blinked, and I sat in the middle of it as the agent. 'In the end, I offered the Russians the extra money. And I said to Arsenal I've done this. And we had 30 seconds to go.' The drama didn't end there, with the Russians unable to fax their approval of the deal through to Arsenal. Although Arshavin scored four against Liverpool early in his career, his time at the Emirates didn't last . 'They had to email it through, and with eight seconds to go the Russians came through with the word 'accepted'.' And the £15million deal was done. What came after wasn't quite as exciting, with Arshavin starting well with an early four-goal bag against Liverpool but he failed to light up the Emirates consistently. He was eventually sold back to Zenit in June 2013 having been sent back there on loan with 31 goals in his 143 games for the Gunners.","Agent Jon Smith recalled the dramatic deal on BT Sport on Monday .

"The boss of the Iceland supermarket chain admitted he would not eat cheap own-brand food products – because they ‘won’t contain much meat’. Malcolm Walker also claimed the horse meat scandal was a ‘storm in a tea cup’, and insisted that supermarkets should not be blamed for it. Most supermarkets sold three types of products, he said – premium, standard and economy – and he would not eat the economy product. Opinion: Malcolm Walker, chief executive of frozen food firm Iceland, said supermarkets are less at fault for the horsemeat problem and slammed councils for awarding food contracts 'based purely on one thing - price' ‘Iceland has never sold economy products – we do not sell cheap food,’ he said. ‘We have one brand of food, one level of food . . . we know where all our food comes from, we follow the supply chain right the way through and it’s very short.’ He added: ‘I wouldn’t eat value supermarket products because they won’t  contain much meat. There will be other things in there, whether it’s rusk or filler or whatever it is.’ Mr Walker, whose chain has removed beef products which tested positive for traces of horse DNA, denied that horse meat was endemic in the food chain. He insisted Britain’s supermarkets ‘shouldn’t be blamed’ for contamination and claimed they had ‘a fantastic reputation for safety’ of products. Instead, he blamed local councils for the scandal, saying they had compromised food quality by trying to drive down the prices of catering contracts for schools and hospitals. Mr Walker said: ‘Supermarkets carry out an enormous range of testing procedures on every product that bears their name. 'Okay, you can say we haven’t been testing for horse. Well, why would we? We don’t test for hedgehog either.’ Products Compare.jpg . Fears: Mark Price, the managing director of Waitrose, warned consumers could pay the price for the scandal, as ensuring food has the best safety guarantees means it can no longer be seen as a 'cheap commodity' He told the BBC that supermarket products did not contain horse meat, even though the scandal erupted last month when Tesco Everyday Value Beef Burgers were found to be 29 per cent horse meat. Tesco then admitted the ‘minced beef’ in its frozen bolognese was up to 100 per cent horse meat. ‘If we’re going to blame somebody,’ Mr Walker said, ‘let’s start with local authorities because there’s a whole side to this industry which is invisible. Trolley: Almost two thirds of respondents now plan to buy meat only from their local butchers, according to a new survey (file picture) Talks: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has called on supermarkets to do more to explain to customers how horsemeat entered the food chain . ‘That’s the catering industry. Schools, hospitals – it’s massive business for cheap food and local authorities award contracts based purely on one thing: price.’ An angry Mr Walker then told Channel 4 News: ‘Supermarkets are on the high street, they’re very visible, and they’ve taken all the blame for this and that’s not right. ‘I don’t believe that any horse flesh has actually ended up in a British supermarket, [it’s] traces, microscopic contamination quantities. 'The Tesco problem was a filler, it wasn’t meat at all, it was a filler that they put into a cheap burger. ‘This is a storm in a tea cup – it’s over-hyped.’ Investigation: FSA chief executive Catherine Brown said that testing was the right way to address the issue, and said the focus would be on areas of higher risk . Investigation: One of the plants raided, Dinos & Sons Continental Foods in Tottenham, said it was 'co-operating with local trading standards officers and the FSA' The Iceland boss’s comments provoked anger from the Local Government Association, which accused Mr Walker of passing the buck and said local authorities did not handle catering contracts for hospitals. A spokesman said: ‘The law is 100 per cent clear that it is the responsibility of the manufacturer, supplier and retailer to make sure the product they sell us is what they say it is. ‘There has been a major supply chain failure that’s not the fault of consumers, councils or hospitals. The companies that supply our food need to take responsibility.’ n Almost a third of voters (31 per cent) have stopped eating ready-meals as a result of the scandal, a poll suggested yesterday, and one in 14 has stopped eating meat altogether. The ComRes survey for the  Independent on Sunday also found that 53 per cent of those questioned favoured a ban on all meat imports ‘until we can be sure of their origin’.

"A nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, who cared for an Ebola-stricken colleague, has revealed today that medical staff were woefully ill-prepared for the crisis and even given supposed protective clothing with gaping holes at the neck. Briana Aguirre, who has worked at the Dallas hospital for three years, admitted to Today that Ebola had not even come up in conversation prior to the arrival of 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan at the facility last month. She said: 'We never talked about Ebola...we were never told what to look for.' Scroll down for video . Nurse Briana Aguirre indicates where her neck was exposed while she treated her colleague Nina Pham who contracted Ebola at Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas . Two nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian, Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) have contracted Ebola at the hospital where they worked while caring for 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan when he was desperately ill . The nurse said that an optional seminar on Ebola had been offered once or twice at the hospital but it only provided information and not hands-on training to deal with the deadly virus. Ms Aguirre cared for nurse Nina Pham, 26, who was diagnosed with Ebola this weekend after caring for Mr Duncan, who died from Ebola last Wednesday. Ms Aguirre said that although her protective gear had been upgraded from the original mask, gown, gloves and booties - there was still a gap of several inches at the neck. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital today released details about their protocols: . According to Texas Health today, nurses who interacted with Mr Duncan wore personal protective equipment consistent with the CDC guidelines. Staff had shoe covers, face shields were required, and a filtering mask which was optional – 'consistent with the CDC guidelines at the time', the hospital emphasized. The nurse told Today that by the time she was involved in Ebola care at Texas Presbyterian, staff were wearing protective Tyvek suits. Although the suit zipped up to the collarbone, went up in a hood around her face and was layered with a protective mask - there was still a gap below the chin. Nurse Aguirre said: 'To be honest, I threw a fit. I just couldn't believe it, in the second week of an Ebola crisis at my hospital, the only gear they were offering us allowed our necks to be uncovered.' She asked an infectious disease nurse why the suits allowed her neck to be exposed and was told to cover the gap with strips of one-inch tape. Ms Aguirre said that she asked someone, who identified himself as vice-president of Texas Presbyterian, why they could not request better protective gear from surrounding hospitals. The nurse said the administrator promised to call her back with some information on where to get help - but never did. Ms Aguirre did not care for Mr Duncan but  heard from colleagues that he was held in an area within close proximity to seven other patients, healthcare workers were moving in and out while not wearing protective clothing. 'The same nurse caring for him was caring for three other patients. She was not wearing anything close to what we're wearing now,' she added. The nurse spoke to Matt Lauer on Today where she said she was deeply worried about losing her job after revealing the chaotic response to Ebola - but said that she felt revealing the failures was the right thing to do. Ms Aguirre, who is not a nurses' union member, was close to tears as she described her job as the 'best she ever had' but admitted that some staff at the hospital would not be happy that she had made them look bad. The mother-of-two young daughters told Today: 'I’m the breadwinner of my family. I’m terrified. I’m just like the majority of middle class, working class people. 'I’m just a couple of paychecks away from not being able to pay my mortgage and I’m terrified about that.' Ms Aguirre appeared with her lawyer on Thursday who said that Ms Aguirre was a whistle-blower and that he hoped the American people would support her for coming forward and sharing what was going on at Texas Presbyterian. It was announced today that the chief of Texas Presbyterian will face a grilling from Congress over how his hospital reacted in response to the deadly virus. Dr Daniel Varga will attend a hearing, along with CDC director Tom Frieden, to investigate why so many failings are being made dealing with Ebola in Dallas. Nurse Aguirre said she 'threw a fit' when she realized she was partially-exposed to Ebola patient Nina Pham - and in a critical area just below her nose and mouth . Ms Aguirre, a mother of two young girls, was close to tears as she revealed her fears of losing her job for blowing the whistle on Ebola care failures at the Dallas hospital . The initial patient, Liberian national Thomas Duncan, was sent home from the hospital on September 25 with antibiotics after presenting with a fever and telling staff he had just arrived from West Africa. He was admitted with contagious symptoms three days later and died last Wednesday. Since then, two nurses who cared extensively for Mr Duncan, cleaning up his waste and inserting catheters, have also been diagnosed with Ebola. Medical records released by Mr Duncan's family show Miss Vinson inserted catheters, drew blood, and dealt with Duncan's body fluids before he died. Nurse Nina Pham, 26, is reportedly in a good condition and being treated in isolation at Texas Presbyterian. Nurse Amber Joy Vinson, 29, was transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Wednesday. She is said to be 'ill but clinically stable'. Earlier this week, nurses at Texas Presbyterian angrily insisted there were no protocols in place for dealing with the virus - and claimed that no hospital in the country was prepared to deal with the deadly virus. The director of the National Nurses Union, RoseAnn DeMoro, directly contradicted the CDC's initial claim that a breach in protocol led to the infection of Miss Pham as she treated Mr Duncan. Hazardous waste from Duncan was 'left to pile up to the ceiling in one room', according to the nursing organization. Nurses were forced to use medical tape to secure openings in their flimsy garments, worried that their necks and heads were exposed as they cared for a patient with explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting, said Deborah Burger of National Nurses United. Ebola patient Amber Joy Vinson is stretchered on the runway by a CDC plane on Wednesday as she makes her way to Atlanta to be treated .

"Search crews will send a robotic . submarine deep into the Indian Ocean on Monday for the first time to try . to determine whether underwater signals detected by sound-locating . equipment are from the missing Malaysian plane's black boxes, the leader . of the search effort said. The . crew on board the Australian navy's Ocean Shield will launch the . unmanned underwater vehicle Monday evening, said Angus Houston, the head . of a joint agency coordinating the search off Australia's west coast. The Bluefin 21 autonomous sub can create a three-dimensional sonar map . of the area to chart any debris on the seafloor. The . move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the . past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft's black boxes. Scroll down for video . Subs: Rescuers are hoping the Artemis AUV submarine (pictured) will be able to help find the missing plane . Bluefin: The remote subs will search the ocean floor for any sign of the missing plane, which was last heard from more than a month ago . 'We haven't had a single detection in six days, so I guess it's time to go under water,' Houston said. Prime . Minister Tony Abbott raised hopes last week when he said authorities . were 'confident' the four underwater signals that have been detected are . coming from the black boxes on Flight 370, which vanished March 8 . during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. But . Houston warned that while the signals are a promising lead, the public . needs to be realistic about the challenges facing search crews, who are . contending with an extremely remote, deep patch of ocean. 'The search area is new to man,' he said. 'I . would caution you against raising hopes that the deployment of the . autonomous underwater vehicle will result in the detection of the . aircraft wreckage - it may not. 'However, this is the . best lead we have, and it must be pursued vigorously. Again, I emphasize . that this will be a slow and painstaking process.' Officials released this map showing areas they plan to search for the missing jetliner . His assessment came after it emerged that Malaysian military investigators believe the missing plane was 'thrown around like a fighter jet' just after it lost contact with the authorities in a bid to dodge radar. Flight MH370 is thought to have climbed to heights of 45,000ft - 10,000ft above its normal altitude - before plummeting to just below 5,000ft. The . plane's two black boxes, which contain flight data and cockpit voice . recordings, have beacons that emit 'pings' so they can be more easily . found, but the beacons' batteries last only about a month, and it has . been more than a month since the plane vanished. The . Australian navy ship Ocean Shield has been dragging a U.S. Navy device . called a towed pinger locator through the water to listen for any sounds . from the beacons. Over the past 10 days, the equipment has picked up . four separate signals. The . Bluefin sub takes six times longer to cover the same area as the ping . locator, and the two devices can't be used at the same time. It will begin searching an area 5km by 8km and will be launched for a second search 24 hours later. Crews were . hoping to detect additional signals before sending down the sub, so they . could triangulate the source and zero in on where exactly the black . boxes may be. Search: A spotter aboard a Royal New Zealand Air Force plane looks for any debris that could be from the missing plane . Pilots:  Zaharie Ahmad Shah (left), 53, and Fariq . Abdul Hamid, 27 (right) were in charge of the plane . But it has . been 38 days since the plane disappeared, and search crews haven't . picked up any new sounds since Tuesday, suggesting that the devices' batteries may now be dead. That is why officials will now being using . the Bluefin, Houston said. The . submarine will take 24 hours to complete each mission: two hours to . dive to the bottom, 16 hours to search the seafloor, two hours to return . to the surface, and four hours to download the data, Houston said. In . its first deployment, it will search a 40-square-kilometer . (15-square-mile) section of seafloor. The . black boxes could contain the key to unraveling the mystery of what . happened to Flight 370 after it disappeared with 239 people on board. Investigators believe the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean . based on a flight path calculated from its contacts with a satellite and . analysis of its speed and fuel capacity. But they still don't know why. Meanwhile, . officials were investigating an oil slick not far from the area where . the underwater sounds were detected, Houston said. Crews have collected a . sample of the oil and are sending it back to Australia for analysis, a . process that will take several days. Joint effort: A U.S. Navy P8 Poseidon waits to join the search for the missing Malaysian airliner . The 'pings' were possibly emitted by the Malaysia flight's black box, which puts a strict time limit on the search, as the black box only has about a month of battery power, and has been missing for a month already . Working alongside ships and aircraft from seven other nations, the two Royal Navy vessels face the same race against time to find the black box flight recorder . The . oil does not appear to be from any of the ships in the area, but . Houston cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about its source. A . visual search for debris on the ocean surface was continuing on Monday . over 47,600 square kilometers (18,400 square miles) of ocean about 2,200 . kilometers (1,400 miles) northwest of the west coast city of Perth. A . total of 12 planes and 15 ships would join the two searches. But . Houston said that the visual search operation would be ending in the . next two to three days. Officials haven't found a single piece of debris . linked to the plane, and Houston said the chances that any would be . have 'greatly diminished.' 'We've . got no visual objects,' he said. 'The only thing we have left at this . stage is the four transmissions and an oil slick in the same vicinity, . so we will investigate those to their conclusion.' The ship is designed for long stays at sea, and could potentially continue its search for up to 60 days . Also aiding Australian vessel Ocean Shield in the search effort is the U.K nuclear submarine HMS Tireless . Complicating . matters further is the depth of the ocean in the search area. The . seafloor is about 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) below the surface, which is . the deepest the Bluefin can dive. Officials are looking for other . vehicles that could help to retrieve any wreckage, should the Bluefin . find any. Houston's gloomy outlook will be met with mixed emotions by relatives of the mostly Chinese passengers. Some . are still clinging to hope that the aircraft has not plunged into the . Ocean and sunk, but has crashed or landed somewhere on land, giving . those on board a chance of surviving. But other relatives have accepted that their loved ones are lost, but want closure with the discovery of the wreckage and recovery of bodies.","Search continues - but it is possible plane's black box batteries have failed .

"Arsenal legend Ray Parlour believes that Arsene Wenger and the club need to start spending more if they want to have any chance of competing for the Premier League title in the future. The Gunners bought Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista for £11.2million and signed 17-year-old midfielder Krystian Bielik in a £2.4million deal from Legia Warsaw during the January transfer window. However, Parlour believes that the club still need to invest heavily in the summer, despite the saying Arsenal squad is in good health. Arsenal legend Ray Parlour believes that the club need to start spending if they want to compete for the title . Parlour wrote on Sportlobster.com: 'The squad they have now is very good, but the signings are important. The age of the squad is very good. 'This summer is going to be so important. They will get back to winning stuff. 'They could overturn Manchester City and Chelsea if they bring in the right players. It is time to kick on from last year's FA Cup win.' Gabriel Paulista (left) and Krystian Bielik both joined the club in the January transfer window . Arsenal have repeatedly been linked with a defensive midfielder, including Southampton's £24m-rated Morgan Schneiderlin. However, Parlour believes the unexpected rise of Francis Coquelin, who starred in the 2-0 away win against Manchester City, will make Arsene Wenger think twice before signing a midfield enforcer. The 23-year-old Frenchman has been featuring regularly for Arsenal ever since the December win over West Ham United, but he is out of contract in the summer. Francis Coquelin's (right) rise might make Arsene Wenger rethink his plans to sign a defensive midfielder . Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin has been heavily linked with a move to the Emirates . Parlour added: 'It is great to see Coquelin play well. A lot of the plaudits go to attacking players, but he's taken his chance very well. 'Wenger is loyal so, if you play well, he will keep on playing you. He's become an important player for Arsenal. 'He probably thought it was his last chance and he's certainly done brilliantly. 'It will be interesting to see what he does in the summer.' Arsenal are currently on a five-match winning streak, including victories over Hull City and Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup. Santi Cazorla's (centre) form has been mesmerising in the past few weeks for Wenger's side . Mezut Ozil's (centre) return to the side has given them a boost and he scored against Aston Villa on Sunday . Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez have scored in recent games and so Parlour believes Wenger has been dealt with a selection headache in attack.

"A mother accused of trying to kill her autistic daughter has today pleaded guilty to first-degree child abuse. Kelli Stapleton entered the plea on Tuesday morning in northern Michigan. Stapleton had been scheduled to go on trial on Wednesday on a charge of attempted murder. Benzie County Chief Assistant Prosecutor Jennifer Tang-Anderson said no sentencing date was set. The maximum punishment for the charge is life in prison. Kelli Stapleton, 46, entered the guilty plea on Tuesday morning in northern Michigan a day ahead of when her trial was supposed to start in Michigan . Mother and child: Kelli Stapleton, left, was found alongside her daughter Isabelle, right, just hours after her husband reported them missing and they were both unconscious last year . Stapleton, 46, is accused of trying to kill herself and her teenage daughter on September 3, 2013 by carbon monoxide poisoning by igniting charcoal grills inside a van. Isabelle, known as Issy, was 14 at the time. She has severe autism and sometimes has violent outbursts. Stapleton's blog had chronicled the challenges her family faced while caring for her. In July, Stapleton's estranged husband, Matt Stapleton, said he will never be able to forgive his wife for attempting to kill their now 15-year-old daughter. Mr Stapleton, from Elberta, said that raising Issy was hard and at one point brought the couple to 'a cracking point,' but that no parent of an autistic child should ever take such extreme measures. 'Kelli did something unspeakable,' he told People magazine. Issy was diagnosed as autistic at two years old, and barely slept until the age of eight when she began taking medication that gave her focus and allowed her parents to rest. However, when she became violent towards her classmates her parents were forced to pull her out of school, 'just for the safety of the other kids,' Mr Stapleton said during an interview last month. However the attacks continued at home. Mrs Stapleton was twice left unconscious by Issy's fits and her younger sister Ainsley, 13, hid in her room to avoid outbursts. Issy's father Matt Stapleton, right, said that he is unable to forgive his wife for trying to kill their daughter . The father said the family was at a complete loss as to what to do next. 'If somebody would have called me (then) and said this horrible thing had happened, I would not have been okay with it, but I would have understood it,' he told People magazine. The family finally got Issy into a residential autism treatment center in January 2013. The program made the teenager calmer and was helping to teach her how to control her fiery temper. Issy attended the Great Lake Center for Autism Treatment in Potage for seven months. Mrs Stapleton acted just days after Issy was released. She allegedly told her daughter they were going on a camping trip and then lit two charcoal grills in the van they were in with the windows up. Both survived after being found unconscious. After 17 years of marriage, Mr Stapleton filed for divorce, partly to show a welfare agency how he's determined to protect Issy and his two other children.

"At a time when Manchester United can’t get away from ridicule, there’s a familiar face who just wants to show them some love. Maybe the man with the backwards cap and cut-off denim shorts is being polite as he mentions a possibility that currently seems inconceivable. ‘I love Manchester,’ he says. ‘Everyone knows that — I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart. I left many good friends there, the supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cristiano Ronaldo kick balls at Jenson Button's supercar . Speed demon: Cristiano Ronaldo poses in front of a McLaren super car during a Tag Heuer . On the road: Ronaldo met with McLaren F1 driver Jenson Button at the Circuit of Jamara track in Madrid . Driving lesson: Button taught the Real Madrid superstar how to drag and skid the £200,000 McLaren . Buckle up: Ronaldo gives a thumbs up before being raced around the track by the former world champion . Burning rubber: Ronaldo and Button test the McLaren supercar to its limits on their day out . It is Cristiano Ronaldo and he’s warming to one of his favourite subjects. ‘I am happy here in Real Madrid and have four more years, but in the future you never know because they treated me unbelievably there.’ The cameras and microphones go off. The mass of handlers that accompany the world’s best footballer on these rare ‘media opportunities’ start their sweep of the room at the culmination of a long day. He has kicked balls at a £200,000 supercar driven by Jenson Button, fired one accurately at a friend’s groin and also grimaced in response to a dignitary’s praise for Jose Mourinho. But now it’s time to leave the arid surrounds of the Jarama race circuit outside Madrid. It’s scorching, inside and out. But Ronaldo has one more thing he wants to say to Sportsmail. ‘I really did love being at Manchester United,’ he says. ‘Believe me, they will be a good team again, I’m sure of it. It is a great club.’ Over the previous 20 minutes, having already talked about his tears, trophies and dream to see his four-year-old son go into professional football, he has had his say on the remarkable summer of spending at Old Trafford. Sealed with a kiss: Ronaldo beat Arjen Robben and Manuel Neuer to be named UEFA's Best Player in Europe . Ripped! The Portuguese celebrates after scoring in the Champions League final to help land  'la decima' Home sickness? Real Madrid forward admits he would love to return to Old Trafford one day . Good friends: (L-R) Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Ronaldo celebrate winning the 2009-09 Premier League . VIDEO Ronaldo hopes for United return . It’s the club Sir Alex Ferguson —the only manager Ronaldo ‘would call a friend’ — once said would not spend fortunes on established talent; a club that once nurtured Ronaldo and has since spent £150million in a single summer spree on the proven capabilities of Angel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao, among others. Ronaldo’s own irritation at Di Maria’s departure from Real will soon be made clear, but their loss, in his eyes, is United’s gain. As is the counter-intuitive addition of Falcao to an already attack-heavy squad, whose fall from grace has been watched closely by arguably their greatest player. Ronaldo is known to follow them diligently on television and online. ‘This can happen,’ he says. ‘Bad moments and good moments. Manchester is passing through a bad moment. Last year it was a horrible season and this year they haven’t started well, either. ‘But I do think they did well to buy Di Maria and Falcao. I think the team will be much better. I want to see them better because it is such a fantastic club and they deserve to be better. ‘Falcao is a very good signing. He is a very good player.’ Father figure: Ronaldo claims Sir Alex Ferguson is the only manager has has ever considered a 'friend' Careless whisper: It's fair to say that Ronaldo and   Jose Mourinho didn't always see eye to eye . And yet conventional logic suggests United need to add more cement to the mix, with a defence and structure less convincing than at any time in recent memory. Priority, or so the common wisdom goes, should have been given to a different part of the pitch. But Ronaldo says: ‘I don’t think Falcao is the wrong type of player for them. ‘He is a top player, so I don’t think it is a wrong buy. He will be a fantastic buy. Manchester have not started well, two points in three games, so they need quality players and Falcao is a quality player. And Di Maria, too.’ Di Maria is also something of a sore point, as was the loss of Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich. For a second summer in succession, having offloaded Mesut Ozil to Arsenal last year, Ronaldo objected to Real’s sale of what he considers key personnel. ‘I have strong opinions, but I can’t always say what I think,’ he later told Spanish reporters. ‘If it was up to me, I wouldn’t have done so. But if the president thinks the best thing for the team is to sign players and let others leave, we must respect and support the decision. ‘With new players, the style will change and it may change for better or worse.’ Class is permanent: The 29-year-old insists that Manchester United will return to former glories . Cream of the crop: Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao are world class signings for United, insists Ronaldo . Red devil: Ronaldo won three Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United . For Ronaldo, at 29 years old and having scored a scarcely believable 255 goals in 250 Real Madrid games, ‘better’ is the only option. Having just enjoyed arguably his finest season, in which he was awarded the Ballon D’Or and won the Champions League for a second time, last month he was named Europe’s best player. When he’s asked to sum it up, his smirk says almost as much as his words. ‘When you are nominated for the best player in Europe, the Ballon d’Or, playing in the Champions League, there is so much pressure,’ he says. ‘You don’t know what will happen. This pressure is inside you — you always have it. ‘But really, the last year was just fantastic. Now the best player in Europe as well, that was fantastic for me. I had an opportunity to say thank you to my team-mates because without them individual awards are not possible. ‘My ambition now is to do the same stuff as last year, win the most important trophies, collectively and individually. I always want to do better than the year before.’ Trouble at home? Ronaldo has criticised Real for selling the likes of Di Maria, Mesut Ozil and Xabi Alonso . Enter the dragon: Ronaldo has not been surprised by Gareth Bale's (L) success in La Liga . New arrivals: Ronaldo welcomes £60m summer signing James Rodriguez to the Bernabeu . Take stat: The Portuguese has scored an incredible 255 goals in 250 games for Real Madrid . As he says this, his young son, Cristiano Jnr, is darting around the room. An hour earlier, the four-year-old had squirmed free from ‘Papa’ and dived into McLaren’s P1 supercar, an £800,000 machine that Ronaldo had been driving as part of a Tag Heuer challenge between him and Button, another ambassador for the watch brand. The company’s CEO, Jean-Claude Biver, had been making small talk with Ronaldo and mentioned his admiration for Mourinho. Ronaldo’s facial expression suggested a lower opinion. Cristiano Jnr, meanwhile, was smiling for cameras in the car. ‘You’re in trouble in 15 years,’ Button said to Ronaldo. ‘He loves cars now,’ Ronaldo said back. And football. ‘It is my dream (for him to play professionally),’ Ronaldo says. ‘Of course I want Cristiano to be a football player. ‘But these things we cannot control.’ Golden balls: Ronaldo celebrates winning the 2014 Ballon d'Or award for the world's best player . Nemesis: The Real Madrid superstar shares a competitive relationship with Lionel Messi (L) It was the presence of the son that led the father to cry when presented with the Ballon d’Or, the token of recognition that he has, maybe briefly, outperformed Lionel Messi. ‘It was an emotional moment for me,’ Ronaldo says. ‘I was honest with myself, I was feeling very emotional and I started to cry. ‘After Cristiano came into my arms, it was probably one of the best moments in my life so far.’ Quite what happens next remains to be seen. He talks of dedicating himself completely to football. He says: ‘If you are not serious you will never be a top professional player — I have thought that since I was 12. That is the advice I give to young boys.’ And he adds that Gareth Bale’s success in Spain is no surprise. ‘He is just a fantastic player and will help Real Madrid win more trophies,’ Ronaldo says. ‘He is feeling more comfortable. It is a different league and a different culture, a different language. You adapt. ‘He is more comfortable on the pitch. A fantastic player.’ Mini me: Ronaldo would like his son Cristiano Jnr (R) to become a professional football player . Fingers crossed: Manchester United and Premier League fans would love to see Ronaldo return to the club . So is Ronaldo. Perhaps one of the greatest in history. United supporters should keep their fingers crossed that he walks like he talks.

"Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert accepts his team must solve their Villa Park problems before they escalate any further. Lambert is under no illusions after his side's desperate home form continued with a shock 1-0 home defeat to Sky Bet League One side Leyton Orient in the Capital One on Wednesday. It came after Villa lost a club-record 10 Barclays Premier League games on their own turf last term, and were knocked out of the cups by Tottenham and Sheffield United. Scroll down for video .

And Lambert, who wants to sign Manchester United's Tom Cleverley before Monday's transfer deadline, knows if they are going to avoid a third straight battle against relegation they must improve. Speaking ahead of Sunday's visit of Hull, the Scot said: 'The home form is vital to you. We've got to get the home form right. Wednesday was what cup football is about. The chances were there in abundance and we should have won the game, but we were not clinical enough in the final third. 'This Sunday will be a totally different atmosphere from Wednesday night. 'The Premier League is a fantastic league to play in and if we can do as well as in the last two games and have bit of luck, we will win it. The first two league games have been excellent. 'There will be changes from Wednesday - lads are back in the equation. What happened on Wednesday night can't detract from league games although boys are disappointed.' Embarrassed: Aston Villa were beaten by Lleyton Orient in the Capital One Cup in their last home game . After the international break, Villa face a daunting run against Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton during September and October. They have claimed four points from their opening two games against Stoke and Newcastle, and Lambert understands the need for victory ahead of their tough run. 'If we take three points this weekend, it'll be seven out of nine, which is a good start,' he said. 'We had the same last year, playing Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea in a in a week. 'I prefer them at the start of season than at the end when everyone is in their stride. We took points off the big ones last season so what's not to say we won't do it again?' Incoming?

Steve Bruce's Hull were knocked out of the Europa League qualifiers by Belgian side Lokeren on Thursday and Lambert expects a response. 'Steve has a good side and has spent bit money,' he added. 'Obviously they went down to 10 men against Stoke last week and, fair play to them, they kept going and got a good point.

"A father has been sentenced to a minimum of 18 years and nine months in prison for beating his two-year-old daughter to death in an attack he had hoped would make her a lesbian. Donovan Lamar Haynes, 23, was sentenced in Flint, Michigan on Monday after pleading no . contest to second-degree murder for the 2011 killing of Ti'Airra Woodward. A pre-sentence investigation report claimed Haynes had beat the girl to turn her gay . in hope that she would avoid men like him, who had a history of . treating women poorly, Mlive reported. Haynes' attorney Elbert Hatchett called . him 'deranged' before Genesee Circuit Judge Joseph J. Farah sentenced him to serve a concurrent five-to-15-years in prison for first-degree child abuse. Proud of yourself? Donovan Haynes smirks as he is escorted into the courtroom in Flint, Michigan for sentencing. He was given at least 18 years for beating his toddler daughter to death three years ago . Defiant: Haynes beat his daughter in the hope she would become a lesbian and avoid men like him . 'You don't beat her in hopes she's going to turn gay,' Farah said, adding that Haynes should have used his own experiences to teach his daughter how to deal with aggressive men. 'This case is a case that defies reason, . logic, common sense,' Hatchett added. '[It's a] tragedy to see the life . of an innocent child snuffed out for no reason at all.' The attorney added that Haynes needs to undergo psychological counseling while in prison. Haynes bit and beat Ti'Airra in July 2011 and she was found unresponsive in the basement of Haynes' mother's Flint Township home. The little girl was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead at Hurley Medical Center. Killed: Two-year-old Ti'Airra Woodward was covered in bite marks when she was found unresponsive in 2011 . Devastated: Charlene Woodward, the girl's grandmother, cries as she embraces a relative outside court . Hurt: Relatives cry outside the court where the judge and attorneys had lambasted his 'senseless' killing . Authorities initially said that it appeared she had died from a blunt force trauma to the abdomen and the medical examiner's report said the toddler died of internal bleeding from a lacerated liver. After her death, Flint Police Chief George Sippert said she was the youngest homicide victim he could remember in 25 years with the department. 'It's extremely tragic and I know it affects a lot of members of the police department that are investigating this case,' he said. Ti'Airra's mother, Nakeesha Woodward, left the court in tears on Monday but returned to the courtroom in time to hear her former boyfriend's sentence. 'I lost a child,' she sobbed as she asked the judge for the strictest punishment.","Donovan Lamar Haynes, 23, was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years and nine months in prison in Flint, Michigan on Monday .

"CLICK HERE for all facts, stats and graphics from the big match at Goodison Park . Chelsea stormed to the top of the Premier League amid a blizzard of nine goals from eight separate scorers in a match bookended by two strikes from Diego Costa. The Spaniard is proving lethal since his £32million move from Atletico Madrid and now has four goals in three league games. But it was an older Chelsea hand, Ramires, who pulled many of the strings in an ultimately impressive victory which keeps Everton waiting for their first win this season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho on mixed emotions after Chelsea's 6-3 victory over Everton and Diego Costa performance . Quick off the mark: Chelsea striker Diego Costa scored opening goal after just 35 seconds . Everton: Howard, Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines, McCarthy, Barry, Mirallas, Naismith, McGeady (Eto'o 70), Lukaku (Besic 89). Subs Not Used: Robles, Gibson, Osman, Stones, Alcaraz. Booked: Howard. Goals: Mirallas 45, Naismith 69, Eto'o 76. Chelsea: Courtois, Ivanovic, Cahill, Terry, Azpilicueta, Ramires, Matic,Willian (Mikel 75),Fabregas (Drogba 89),Hazard (Luis 83), Costa. Subs Not Used: Cech, Zouma, Schurrle, Salah. Booked: Costa, Ramires, Fabregas. Goals: Costa 1, Ivanovic 3, Coleman 67 og, Matic 74, Ramires 77, Costa 90. Att: 39,402 . Ref: Jon Moss (W Yorkshire). Everton manager Roberto Martinez made just one change from the starting XI who let slip a 2-0 lead against Arsenal at home last week, Aiden McGeady replacing the injured Steven Pienaar. Two recent former Chelsea employees were involved, with £28million Romelu Lukaku starting up front and Samuel Eto’o on the bench having joined on a free transfer last week. Jose Mourinho has seen four strikers leave Stamford Bridge this summer, selling Lukaku to Everton and Demba Ba to Besiktas, not offering Eto’o a further deal and loaning Fernando Torres — the unhappy Spaniard with that £50m millstone around his neck — to Milan for two years. Mourinho made two changes from the side who beat Leicester 2-0, bringing in Ramires and Willian for Andre Schurrle, who is recovering from injury, and Oscar, who was injured in training on Friday. Ramires’ impact was immediate, starting the move that ended with the Chelsea a goal up within 35 seconds. He passed to Willian, who found Cesc Fabregas, who again showed the vision and execution that are likely to make him a player of the season contender as he bisected Everton’s defence with a through ball to Diego Costa. The 25-year-old striker made a brilliantly timed diagonal run behind Syvlain Distin to collect the ball, take one touch and slam it through Tim Howard’s legs. Everton were rocked and Chelsea took quick advantage, with Costa and Ramires both instrumental again. Costa on the left slotted right to Ramires in the D, from where he slid a pass to Branislav Ivanovic, who fired right-footed across Howard and into the left-hand side of the goal. Replays showed Ivanovic to have been marginally offside as the final ball was played but the officials saw nothing wrong and the visitors were two up in three minutes. Referee Jonathan Moss did Everton a slight favour five minutes later when Howard ran out to catch a ball forward to Ramires, and caught it while appearing to be marginally outside his area. Instead of a handball, Moss allowed play to continue. Quickfire: Costa celebrates opening the scoring after just 35 seconds at Goodison Park .

Everton first had the ball in the net in the 16th minute, Sylvain Distin bundling over the line after being hit by a rebound off the bar from Lukaku header. But Distin was deemed offside and it didn’t count. Steven Naismith shot wide a minute later and with Everton applying pressure throughout the first half, they were eventually rewarded just before the break. McGeady broke from midfield and laid off to Seamus Coleman, who crossed perfectly for Kevin Mirallas to send a powerful header beyond Thibaut Courtois. Everton started the second half brightly, Lukaku shooting over and Distin threatening with a header. It took seven minutes for Chelsea to settle after the break and then threaten again, Ramires feeding Costa, who ran on goal alone. Howard came forward to close down his options and Costa unleashed a shot which the American managed to toe wide — just. Costa’s next shot shortly afterwards was straight at Howard. At the other end, Naismith had an effort blocked by John Terry, then Costa was booked for an altercation with Coleman before resuming his role as a nuisance, collecting from Fabregas and distributing to Ivanovic, who shot wide. Chelsea extended their lead when Eden Hazard progressed to the left side of the six-yard box and slid in a ball that took a deflection off Coleman for an own goal, sparking an altercation that saw Howard booked. But Everton cut the deficit within two minutes, McGeady releasing Naismith to make the score 3-2. Ramires played the provider role again in the 74th minute for Nemanja Matic, who smashed a left-foot shot in off the right-hand post to restore the cushion. Eto’o, just on as a substitute for McGeady, pulled back another goal for Everton two minutes later, but Ramires made it 5-3 with a neat finish over Howard after a one-two with Matic. Costa finished things off in the last minute, rounding Howard and scoring left-footed following a misplaced backheel by substitute Muhamed Besic. Astonishing.

"Schools and hospitals are on lock-down across Cleveland and seven people have voluntarily quarantined themselves after it emerged the second US nurse to contract Ebola spent three days in the city. Amber Jay Vinson, 29, already had a fever when she traveled home to Ohio to plan her wedding and visit her mother last Friday, despite being one of the 76 medical workers from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital under observation by the Centers for Disease Control. Today it emerged Vinson, who had treated  Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, went shopping at a bridal store with five friends for a fitting while harboring concerns that she was sick. Health officials say she was told she was at risk for exposure to the disease but boarded a Frontier Airlines flight regardless. The news has prompted high schools and medical centers to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with Vinson. And the Ohio Department of Health has now ordered anyone who had contact with Amber Vinson to go into a mandatory quarantine for 21 days. Scroll down for video . Fears: Schools have been closed and nurses placed under observation after it emerged the second nurse to be struck with Ebola flew on a commercial flight from Cleveland with Ohio citizens despite knowing she was ill . Infected: Amber Jay Vinson, 29, knew she had a fever when she boarded the commercial flight in Cleveland . Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with five friends. Those friends have now all been placed in quarantine where they will be interviewed and tested daily. The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk. There are now seven people in quarantine in Ohio after being in contact with Vinson, and her mother is in quarantine in Dallas. Health officials at a press conference in Cleveland today insisted they will continue to plug Vinson for more details about her three days in and around the city as they acknowledged she may not be able to remember her every move. Meanwhile, schools and hospitals are taking precautions. Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) has ordered a teacher at Cranwood elementary school to stay at home today after learning last night that they may have come in contact with a person diagnosed with the Ebola virus. Shopping trip: Vinson visited Coming Attractions Bridal & Formal in Cleveland, Ohio, while feeling ill . Voluntary quarantine: The owners of the clothing store have voluntarily closed down for the day pending tests . Overnight, the entire school has been 'thoroughly cleaned with a bleach-based cleaning solution according to guidelines provided by the Center for Disease Control,' the board said. A few miles south east of Cleveland, staff and pupils were today barred from Solon Middle School and Parkside Elementary School in Solon, Ohio. It came after a middle school teacher that works at both schools revealed they had traveled home from Dallas on Frontier Airlines on Tuesday - on a different flight, but possibly the same plane as Vinson, NBC reported. Meanwhile, a number of nurses at Cleveland Clinic, The MetroHealth System, and University Hospitals have been placed on paid leave after traveling on the same flight as Vinson. Precautions: Frontier Airlines staff at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport now wear protective gloves . Lock-down: Streams of passengers have admitted themselves to Cleveland hospitals fearing infection . They are being monitored for symptoms of fever, nausea or fatigue. The hospitals said in a statement: 'We are confident that these nurses are at low risk of exposure since we understand [Vinson] did not have symptoms at the time. 'We have taken this measure as an extra precautionary step for our employees, patients, and visitors.' A stream of people admitted themselves to Cleveland's UH Case Medical Center yesterday claiming to have flown with Vinson but it transpired none had been aboard the same flight. According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements. He said CDC guidelines would be updated to clarify that air travel should not occur. Parkside Elementary School, a few miles south east of Cleveland, was closed today amid fears of Ebola . A teacher who works at Solon and Parkside is under observation after boarding the same plane as Vinson . Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days. But on October 10, Miss Vinson left the Dallas area to plan her upcoming wedding in Cleveland, Ohio. Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane. When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold. 'This nurse, Nurse Vinson, did in fact call the CDC several times before taking that flight and said she has a temperature, a fever of 99.5, and the person at the CDC looked at a chart and because her temperature wasn’t 100.4 or higher she didn’t officially fall into the category of high risk,' CBS Dallas/Fort Worth reports. CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call. Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus. Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' on Wednesday.","Elementary school cleaned, two schools shut, nurses under observation .

"Nurses wore too much protective clothing while treating Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, the CDC has claimed. The shocking accusation is the latest of many contradictions made by the center as it emerges medical chiefs are still not sure how to tackle the deadly virus. Blaming staff at Texas Presbyterian Hospital for the latest outbreaks, CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden said removing multiple layers of gloves and overalls is so difficult that it increases the risk of contamination. His words come hours before he faces a grilling alongside the operator of the Texan hospital on Capitol Hill as Congress desperately tries to determine why so many failings have occurred. Scroll down for video . Too much? The CDC now claims Texan nurses should have worn less protective clothing to avoid infection . Centers of Disease Control and Prevention director Dr Thomas Frieden (left) and the chief clinical officer for Texas Health Resources, Dr Daniel Varga (right), will face questions in Congress over their handling of the Ebola outbreak . 'These are good, dedicated people who worried about themselves and their families and they were trying to protect themselves better, but in fact by putting on more layers of gloves or other protective clothing, it becomes much harder to put them on, it becomes much harder to take them off. 'And the risk of contamination during the process of taking these gloves off gets much higher. That's true for several different areas of the body,' Frieden said last night. The allegation is expected to be rebuffed by Dr Daniel Varga, the operator of the Texan hospital in which two nurses contracted Ebola, when the pair appear together before Congress at noon today. Dr  Varga, chief clinical officer at Texas Health Resources, conceded that errors were made by Presbyterian hospital in Dallas, which sent Thomas Eric Duncan home after he complained of a fever and abdominal pain when he arrived from his native Liberia last month. 'Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr Duncan, despite our best intentions and highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes,' Varga will tell the US Congress. 'We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry'. Duncan died on October 8, a week after he became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, and two weeks since he first sought treatment at the hospital's A&E department. Texas Health initially explained its failure to diagnose Duncan, who did not have health insurance, by saying a nurse had not shared the patient's travel records with a doctor. However, it has subsequently retracted this statement. Dr Varga wrote in his testimony: 'In our effort to communicate to the public quickly and transparently, we inadvertently provided some information that was inaccurate and had to be corrected.' He conceded that this had been 'unsettling to a community that was already concerned and confused'. Two nurses involved in his care – Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29 – have since been diagnosed with the virus, raising serious questions about the hospital's procedures. Dr Varga said said he and his colleagues 'don't yet know precisely how or when' Pham was infected with Ebola as she was 'using full protective measures under CDC protocols'. Sickened: Amber Vinson (left) and Nina Pham (right) both cared for Thomas Eric Duncan and both have been diagnosed with Ebola . Ms Vinson, in a yellow hazmat suit, is seen boarding a plane bound for Emory around 4:30pm  on Wednesday . A plane carrying Ms Vinson, who tested positive for Ebola, departs Love Field for Atlanta . Ms Vinson's plane landed in Atlanta around 7:45pm Eastern Time. She was then seen being loaded into an ambulance (pictured) to be taken to Emory University Hospital . The National Nurses United union criticised Texas Health for Duncan's care after medical records suggested staff worked in the quarantine unit with their skin exposed during the three days between when the patient was admitted and when he was diagnosed. They alleged other failings in protective clothing and the isolation of Duncan. The 77 healthcare workers believed to have worked in the quarantine room with Duncan or handled samples of his blood are being monitored for symptoms. Dr Varga said in his testimony the staff had been separated into three categories based on how at-risk they were. Those at highest risk have been told to stay off work and not use public transport and were required to remain in the county where they live. In a statement on Wednesday, the CDC said: 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms that the second healthcare worker who tested positive last night for Ebola traveled by air October 13, the day before she reported symptoms. 'Because of the proximity in time between the evening flight and first report of illness the following morning, CDC is reaching out to passengers who flew on Frontier Airlines flight 1143 Cleveland to Dallas/Fort Worth on October 13. CDC is asking all 132 passengers on the Frontier Airlines flight (the flight route was Cleveland to Dallas Fort Worth and landed at 8.16pm CT) to call 1 800-CDC INFO (1 800 232-4636). After 1pm ET, public health professionals will begin interviewing passengers about the flight, answering their questions, and arranging follow up. Individuals who are determined to be at any potential risk will be actively monitored. The healthcare worker exhibited no signs or symptoms of illness while on flight 1143, according to the crew. Frontier is working closely with CDC to identify and notify passengers who may have traveled on the flight.' However, according to Flight-tracker, the plane was used for five additional flights on Tuesday before it was removed from service. Those flights include a return flight to Cleveland, Cleveland to Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport (FLL), FLL to Cleveland, Cleveland to Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), and ATL to Cleveland. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have also come under fire for their handling of the deadly virus. CDC Director Thomas Frieden has admitted he should have sent a bigger team to Dallas after the initial diagnosis. This was despite him making a prediction in August that major hospitals would be equipped to tackle the disease. The CDC have also faced criticism for allowing Ms Vinson, the second nurse to contract Ebola, to board a commercial flight despite her alarmingly high temperature. Ms Vinson had asked the CDC whether should could take a flight on October 13 to Ohio, where she was to spend time with her family. She had been told to proceed because her temperature of 99.5F (37.5C) fell below the CDC threshold of 100.4F. CDC officials have since acknowledged that she should not have flown on a commercial plane. Dr Frieden said: 'Those who have exposures to Ebola, she should not have traveled on a commercial airline. 'The CDC guidance in this setting outlines the need for controlled movement. That can include a charter plane; that can include a car; but it does not include public transport. 'We will from this moment forward ensure that no other individual who is being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than controlled movement.' The CDC is now trying to contact every person that was on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday. Ms Vinson reported to the hospital on Tuesday, the day after she landed, and was put in isolation within 90 minutes. Dr Frieden has said his agency will 'double down' on disease surveillance and interventions to stop the spread of Ebola. President Barack Obama has pledged to tackle Ebola in a 'much more aggressive way' His pledge was echoed by President Barack Obama, who has said his administration will target Ebola in a 'much more aggressive way'. He said: 'We're reviewing exactly how we're going to make sure that something like this is not repeated – and we are monitoring, supervising, overseeing in a much more aggressive way exactly what has taken place in Dallas initially, and making sure that the lessons learned are then transmitted to hospitals and clinics all across the country.' The President also said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would launch a 'rapid response SWAT team' within 24 hours whenever a new case is confirmed. Obama is struggling amid low approval ratings to show that he is in command of the world's most sophisticated public health infrastructure as Ebola threatens to claim tens of thousands of lives across the Atlantic Ocean.","CDC chief Dr Thomas Frieden said difficulty of removing multiple layers of gloves and overalls increases the risk of passing on the deadly virus .

"Apple is planning to ramp up security on its iCloud service to keep hackers out of user accounts. Chief executive Tim Cook made the announcements in the face of the . recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from the online service. Mr Cook told the Wall Street Journal Apple will aggressively encourage . users to take stricter security measures, and the firm will alert users if someone tries to access their files. Scroll down for video . Apple is planning to ramp up security on its iCloud service to keep hackers out of user accounts. Chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) said the firm will now send alerts to users each time someone tries to access and make changes to an iCloud account . These alerts will be sent using email and push notifications each time someone tries to change an account password, restore iCloud . data to a new device, or when a device logs into an account for . the first time. It is possible for users to enhance the security of their documents by turning off iCloud through Settings > iCloud on their device when they are not using it. They can also turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account. The tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password. To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID. Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security. Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices. A trusted device is one that can receive 4-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone. Once enabled, any time a user signs in to manage their Apple ID at My Apple ID, or make an iTunes, App Store, or iBooks Store purchase from a new device, they'll need to verify their identity by entering both their password and a 4-digit verification code. Apple is said to be moving quickly to restore confidence in its . systems' security ahead of the crucial launch of its new iPhone . next week. 'When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,' Mr Cook said. 'I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.' Cook added that Apple will also broaden its use of the two-factor . authentication security system to avoid future intrusions. Two-factor authentication requires a user to have two of . three things to access an account. This can include a password, . a separate four-digit one-time code, or a long access key given . to the user when they signed up for the service. 'The usability battle will always be there but could you . ever imagine using your debit card at an ATM and not entering a . pin? That's two factor, something you have - a card - and something . you know - a pin- and we all get along just fine,' WhiteHat . Security's Matt Johansen told Reuters. Following the attack, The Next Web spotted code on software development site Github called iBrute, that would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. However, after an investigation, Apple said on Tuesday the attacks  on celebrities' iCloud accounts were . individually targeted, and that none of the cases it . investigated had resulted from a breach of its systems. It is now working with law enforcement to identify the hackers. The announcement comes in the face of the recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from Apple's iCloud service (pictured). Cook said Apple will also broaden its use of the two-factor authentication security system to avoid future intrusions . Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) was among the 101 celebrities who had their photos stolen from iCloud. She is said to have posted more than 60 nude selfies to the online service . 'We want to do everything we can do to protect our customers, because we are as outraged if not more so than they are,' continued Mr. Cook. The iCloud service lets users store photos and other . content, and access it from any Apple device. Scammers have been taking advantage of the celebrity hacking scandal to trick people into entering their Apple ID and password details into a fake login screen. Security experts recently discovered emails and text messages that claim to be from Apple, warning users about unauthorised access to their accounts. The latest threat to people's accounts comes as both the FBI and Apple have said they are investigating the link. The so-called phishing emails are designed to trick people into offering up their details. iCloud secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication (explained above). This suggests the hackers were able to obtain the login credentials of the accounts, and pretend to be the user, in order to bypass this encryption . Apple is said to be moving quickly to restore confidence in itssystems' security ahead of the crucial launch of its new iPhone next week. Shares of the smartphone maker slumped 4 per cent this week (graph pictured) - its worst percentage drop since late-January - as Apple faced scrutiny of its security systems . Apple already offers a high-level of security on its iCloud account. The service secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication. Tim Barajin, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, told MailOnline: 'Security in the cloud is an issue generally - you have to completely trust Google, Apple, Samsung. 'Apple has some of the most powerful encryption tools out there - which is why they have almost a billion credit cards of file, and nobody had ever got hold of those.' Shares of the smartphone maker slumped 4 per cent this week - its worst percentage drop since late-January - as Apple faced scrutiny of its security systems. The stock lost $3.57 to $99.15, with 94 million shares changing hands, exceeding its 50-day daily moving average of 45.8 million shares traded, and putting it on track for one of its busiest days of the year.","Apple's Tim Cook revealed the plans following the celebrity photo scandal .

"Lee Cattermole has invited Roy Hodgson to the Stadium of Light – for the Sunderland enforcer believes he is the man to anchor England’s midfield. There has been much debate over the merits of Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere in such a role and it is the one position in Hodgson’s team which appears up for grabs. Cattermole’s former Black Cats team-mate Jack Colback – now at Newcastle – had been earmarked for a trial run in the holding berth until injury ruled him out of the recent matches with Norway and Switzerland. Sunderland's Lee Cattermole believes he is the man to anchor England’s midfield . But Sunderland’s in-form midfielder has urged Three Lions manager Hodgson to check on his progress having made huge strides under the tutorship of Gus Poyet on Wearside. Indeed, the Uruguayan boss says his own country would relish a Cattermole type at the heart of their engine-room. And the 26-year-old said: ‘You see lads getting opportunities now and for me that has got to be a motivation. ‘In recent years, it is not something for me to be too interested in because of the names that were playing - the Gerrards and the Lampards. But you look at the boys who have got in and who are playing well and that is something that I am trying to achieve. ‘So yes, it has become a goal for me getting into the squad. England is going through that cycle of change right now. Sunderland's Lee Cattermole is hindered by a chequered disciplinary record . ‘We’ve got a few English players here – Jack Rodwell, Adam Johnson, Connor Wickham and me - and I’d like to think Roy Hodgson will come up (to see us play).’ Cattermole, of course, is hindered by a chequered disciplinary record, seven red cards having earned him the nickname ‘Lee Clattermole’. But he has now enjoyed a run of 28 matches without seeing red – he previously averaged a dismissal every 26 games, a ratio only bettered by John Hartson and Vinnie Jones – and believes a calmer head is a by-product of Poyet’s faith. ‘I am in a good time in my career at the moment,’ he went on. ‘I feel I am not having to try as hard on the pitch and that helps. ‘That is a big thing for me. I am really comfortable about my game, very focussed every week now. Lee Cattermole has now enjoyed a run of 28 matches without seeing red . ‘Gus Poyet sides have a big role for the defensive midfielder. Since the manager has come in I have adapted my game to what he wants and that is pure and simple, a defensive midfielder. I have learnt an unbelievable amount since he came here.’ Cattermole was capped at every level from Under-16 to Under-21 and admits he expected to progress to the seniors. And the former Middlesbrough academy player makes no secret of his desire to once again pull on the white of his country. ‘My last game for the Under 21s was in the Euros final in Sweden against Germany. I could have played on the next season but Stuart Pearce told me it was time for the next generation,’ he said. Fabian Delph made his England debut against Switzerland on Monday . ‘I probably did expect a senior call up at the time. So it would mean an awful lot to me to get a call-up now. Every English player would be lying if they said they were not looking to play for England. ‘The wider perception is that players don’t care but a lot of the time, it is just trying to be cool around each other, not letting on how much you really do care.’ Cattermole, meanwhile, believes there would be room for himself and North-East adversary Colback in the England set-up. ‘Jack has got in thanks to his performances for us last season and he has obviously had a good pre-season (at Newcastle),’ he said. ‘The manager obviously fancies him and fair play to him. I spoke to Jack last week and he really enjoyed his time with England. Now he is in that circle he has an opportunity to improve himself.’","Lee Cattermole believes he is the man to anchor England’s midfield .

"It has encountered little difficulty attracting stars from the world of showbusiness. But those required for hygiene and safety are proving harder to gain for the Chiltern Firehouse. The exclusive London restaurant has been given only two out of five stars by food health inspectors, meaning an improvement in the kitchen’s cleanliness is necessary. Officers discovered several areas were not clean, food had not been cooked to its own recommended safe levels and large amounts of the kitchen had no soap for staff to wash their hands. David Cameron and wife Samantha visited Chiltern Firehouse on one of their 'date nights' in June this year. The restaurant has now been criticised in a local council health and safety report . The restaurant, in Marylebone, central London, has become the place to be seen for London's elite . Prime Minister David Cameron took his wife Samantha there last month for one of their ‘date-nights’ and he is not the only one. David Beckham, former US President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Kevin Spacey and Kylie Minogue have all dined at the popular nightspot in recent weeks but they may not have been keen to try its signature dish of crab-stuffed doughnuts had they read the report compiled by inspectors last month. It reveals the service fridge, fryer, freezer, and floor in the area which stores the kitchen’s dry food were all deemed ‘dirty’. Broken glass was found on the shelves of the freezer and the fly screen that prevented insects entering where food is prepared was also judged not to be clean. There were also gaps in an external store that could have posed a risk of pests entering the kitchen. A report reveals staff were unable to effectively wash their hands as there was no soap or hot water in the basins in the kitchen’s food preparation area, pastry preparation or grill station. There was also no hot water available at the sink by the kitchen’s entrance. David Beckham has become a regular at the restaurant since moving to London and Nigella Lawson is a fan . A spokesman for the restaurant said the points highlighted in the report have already been rectified . Meals involving ‘high-risk’ meats, such as beef, lamb and pork, were cooked but recorded at temperatures below safe levels set in its own manuals. Inspectors criticised the restaurant for not writing down what happened to these dishes – allowing them to tell whether it was thrown away or served to customers. The restaurant, which opened earlier this year, is part of a hotel housed in the Grade II-listed former Marylebone Fire Station and run by André Balazs, who owns the glamorous Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and the Mercer hotel in New York. The menu by head chef Nuno Mendes, is not overtly expensive with most main courses costing £25. Typical dishes include chargrilled iberico pork and blackened salmon with sea kale. Other A-listers to have visited the venue include singer Lily Allen, supermodel Kate Moss, music mogul Simon Cowell, actress Linsday Lohan, former prime minister Tony Blair and actors Bradley Cooper and Orlando Bloom have all been photographed sneaking out of the back door. Hollywood star Kate Beckinsale (left) and singer Rita Ora (right) have also been seen at the hotspot . The stream of celebrity diners has made the restaurant one of the most sought after places to eat in the capital . Commenting on the food inspection, Westminster’s food safety manager James Armitage said: ‘When we inspected the Chiltern Firehouse kitchens, we found a number of areas that raised concern including cleanliness and the state of repair of various ceilings, walls and floor coverings. Also, several of the hand basins in the kitchen were lacking soap and hot water.’ A Chiltern Firehouse spokesman said: ‘We are very proud of the restaurant at Chiltern Firehouse, and appreciate the tremendously supportive reviews it has received. 'The vast majority of the issues identified in the council report were related to the expansion of the kitchen and have already been rectified. ‘We have requested a re-inspection and look forward to a significantly higher rating at the earliest opportunity.’","Trendy London restaurant is favourite among A-list celebrities .

"Child survivors of the Holocaust will receive additional financial assistance from the German government to help them cope with problems caused by physical trauma and malnutrition inflicted by the Nazis. The agreement will provide one-time payments of 2,500 euros - roughly £2,000 - for Jews who were in concentration camps, ghettos or spent at least six months in hiding as children, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. It represents the first time the German government has recognised the unique problems facing child survivors, said Claims Conference executive vice president Greg Schneider, who was involved in the negotiations. Payments are available to those who were held in concentration camps, ghettos, or spent more than six months in hiding. Above, file picture showing children behind barbed-wire fencing in Auschwitz . The German Finance Ministry on Thursday . confirmed the agreement, which is worth an estimated total £153million, . but refused to provide further details. Mr Schneider said: 'All of this is being driven by the fact that we're in the final years. 'If there's going to be any final message that the German government or the German people are going to give to survivors, these are literally the last years to do it.' Mr Schneider estimated that some 75,000 survivors around the world could qualify for the payments, designed to help them with physical and psychological problems stemming from childhood malnutrition and emotional trauma. He said that some were witness to 'unimaginable atrocities'. He said: 'A range of . injurious experiences has had a cumulative effect ... resulting in . late-onset problems that are only now manifesting as physical and . psychological symptoms in the survivors' advanced age.' An estimated 75,000 survivors around the world could qualify for the payments. Above, a file picture showing women and children packed into a room at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany . He added that as so many survivors lost most, if not all, relatives in the Holocaust, many lack family support in their old age and have no inherited wealth to help them. The agreement, which still has to be approved by the German Parliament but isn't expected to meet any political resistance, will provide the one-time payment to Nazi victims born January 1 1928 or later. That would have made them at oldest 11 at the start of the war, and 17 by its end. The payment will come in addition to any other compensation received and the fund is expected to become operational from January 1 2015. Also starting in January, Germany is providing the Claims Conference with 205 million euros - roughly £198million - to begin paying for home care help for Holocaust victims, according to a previous agreement. An additional 210 million euros will be paid in 2016, and 215 million euros in 2017. The payments mark the first time Germany has recognised the problems facing child survivors: Above, 1943 file photo, showing a group of Jews, including a small boy, being escorted from the Warsaw Ghetto . In total, Germany has paid around 70 billion euros - £55billion - in compensation for Nazi crimes, primarily to Jewish survivors. Compensation has evolved continuously since Germany agreed in 1952 to make payments, with annual negotiations between the Claims Conference and the German government on who should receive funds and how much will be paid. Mr Schneider said: 'There's no amount of money that can ever compensate for what happened to a person during the Holocaust, but even a symbolic acknowledgement is extraordinarily important.'","Agreement provides one-time payments of 2,500 euros - roughly £2,000 .

"Ryan Palmer has felt all year that something special was going to happen. For now, he'll take his lowest round of the season. Palmer took only 21 putts and made birdie on half of his holes on Friday at the TPC Boston, giving him an eight-under-par round of 63 and a two-shot lead over Keegan Bradley after the opening round of the Deutsche Bank Championship. 'It was one of my best ones of the year, for sure,' Palmer said. Form: American Ryan Palmer leads the Deutsche Bank Championship by two shots after a round of 63 . Snapping at the heels: Compatriot Keegan Bradley is just two shots further back after an opening 65 . He didn't miss a putt inside 15 feet and closed out his round with a pitching wedge to 18 feet, making the downhill putt for his ninth birdie. Bradley matched his low round of the season, though what meant more was the timing. This is the final week before U.S. captain Tom Watson decides which three players he will pick to fill out his Ryder Cup team. Bradley always seemed like a logical choice, though he wants to leave nothing to chance. He played bogey-free in a gentle breeze, and it was just the start he needed. 'I'm not going to sit up here and say any cliches that I'm not thinking about the Ryder Cup or any of that,' Bradley said. 'I am very aware every second of the day that I'm being watched by the captain. And I'm just trying to embrace that be aware of it and enjoy it if I can.' Webb Simpson, who also needs a pick to return to the Ryder Cup, and Jason Day of Australia were among those at 66. Jordan Spieth recovered from a double bogey to start his round and, with his entire family in tow, turned it around with four birdies and an eagle for a 67. Also at 67 was Ian Poulter, who seems certain to be a Ryder Cup pick for Europe on Tuesday considering how much damage he's done to the Americans in the competition. Poulter was thinking only about his golf, which hasn't been very good this year. Mixed: World Number One Rory McIlroy was brilliant at times and dreadful at others as he shot an opening 70 . Frustration: McIlroy had to endure a round of brilliant birdies as well as frustrating bogies on the course . 'I just want to play golf,' Poulter said. 'It's been a (bad) year, and I want to turn it around right now.' Rory McIlroy was brilliant at times and sloppy at other times in his round of 70. Phil Mickelson had a 74. He wasn't sure what to expect and even Lefty had to be surprised by his card that featured six pars, six birdies, four bogeys, a double bogey and a triple bogey. 'I said it would be feast or famine,' Mickelson said. 'I was hoping it would be Stableford. If it was Stableford, I'd be right in it.' Instead, he needs a good round Saturday to make sure he stays in the top 70 in the FedEx Cup to advance next week to the third playoff event in Denver. For two weeks - especially this one - the FedEx Cup shares the stage for that other cup. So many players are thinking less about the chase for a £7.6million bonus, and more about a chance to play a tournament where they don't get paid at all. Watson and European captain Paul McGinley announce their three picks Tuesday. This is the final qualifying week for Europe, though only the players competing in Italy this week can affect the standings. On the up: Ian Poulter shot a decent four-under-par round as he looks to sew up a Ryder Cup wildcard pick . Palmer finished No. 18 in the Ryder Cup standings. His name hasn't been mentioned as prominently as others bidding for captain's pick. But he looked plenty good Friday. 'I keep telling myself something is going to happen. I don't know where or when,' Palmer said. 'My game has been in good shape. It was a matter of getting it all together.' His regular caddie, James Edmondson, didn't make the trip. Edmondson is close friends with Lance Bennett, who works for Matt Kuchar. Bennett's wife died of a seizure Tuesday in Dallas, and caddies and some players wore a black hat with an orange ribbon as a tribute to Angela Bennett. The couple has a 4-year-old daughter. 'When he said, `I may need to stay home,' I said, `Done. Don't worry about. We're just playing golf,'' Palmer said. Bradley won all three of his matches with Mickelson in the last Ryder Cup at Medinah and is desperate to be on the American team that will try to win the cup back on Sept. 26-28 at Gleneagles in Scotland. And he's not shy about saying so. 'When I wake up, I'm thinking about it. When I'm on the course, I'm thinking about it,' he said. Bradley was never in big trouble. He drove it long and straight, and that goes a long way on the TPC Boston. Bradley played with Mickelson in three matches at Medinah in the last Ryder Cup, and they never lost. Bradley also played a practice round at Gleneagles with Watson before the British Open. 'I think if I go out and shoot good scores, yeah, I think I'm in good shape,' Bradley said. 'But there's so many great players that aren't on this team. I don't take anything for granted. I don't think I'm a lock by any means.'

"Forget the theory that men are from Mars and women from Venus – our brains are the same, an expert insists. Neuroscientist Professor Gina Rippon says the sexes are not ‘hardwired’ in different ways and there is no evidence that men are innately better at reading maps or that women are better at multi-tasking. Any difference is due to society’s idea of gender, not to biology, and is deterring a generation of women from becoming scientists, she warns. Scroll down for video . Forget the stereotypes: It's the title of a famed U.S. book - road-tested by couple Richard and Julie Curtis in the 2001 Channel 4 series Living by the Book - but it seems men and women aren't from different planets after all . Video courtesy of Southbank Centre's WOW – Women of the World Festival 2014 . Professor Rippon, of Aston University, Birmingham, said differences in the brain are formed in childhood by divisions in the games girls and boys play and stereotypes they conform to. The scientist said the human brain is much more malleable than we think. She highlighted recent research which showed that women given a Tetris console game to play for three months displayed fundamental changes in their brain structure. The Californian study found that women who regularly played the game - which involves manipulating shapes in a logical way - had grown part of their brain associated with spatial skills. It showed that the brain changes far more regularly than we think and is affected by stereotypes and attitudes – nurture not nature – all the way through life, she said. ‘If you just look at gender differences – and not their experiences in life – then, yes, you might find differences. But the brains of men and women are much more similar than they are different.’ Professor Rippon, who will address the British Science Festival in Birmingham on Sunday, added: ‘We really cannot afford to sit back and accept the “essentialist” view that girls are not going to be interested in science subjects because of some “brain deficiency”. ‘We need more trained scientists and engineers but 50 per cent of our pool of talent is not engaging. ‘People who could study these subjects or do these jobs are choosing not to. ‘This must not be explained away by misguided and misleading explanations in terms of unchangeable biological characteristics, or references to “the natural order of things”.’ Her views - for which she has been labelled a ‘gender difference denier’ - are contradicted by a prominent study published last year. The study, in which the brains of 949 young men and women were scanned at the University of Pennsylvania, suggested that women had better connections between the left and right-hand sides of the brain, while men had better links between the front and back. The authors claimed their findings demonstrated that women are better disposed to deal with ‘analytical’ and ‘intuitive’ tasks at the same time. Men, meanwhile, were better at complex motor skills, they said. Professor Rippon dismissed the study as having neglected the idea that these changes were caused by nurture - not nature - and said there is no such thing as a ‘hardwired’ brain. ‘There is quite a lot of thoughtless science being done and quite a lot of overenthusiastic presenting. If you just look at gender differences - and not their experiences in life - then yes you might find differences. ‘But the brains of men and women are much more similar than they are different.’ Video courtesy of Aston University . http://www.aston.ac.uk/lhs/staff/az-index/rippong/ . http://www.aston.ac.uk/braincentre . http://www.aston.ac.uk/ .","Claims made by Prof Gina Rippon of Aston University in Birmingham .

"Jennifer Lawrence is among actresses whose naked photographs were posted on the website last week . According to denizens of the darker corners of the internet, where criminality and vice thrive on private forums, the pictures had been around for months. A small group of hackers, linked by their obsessive interest in finding explicit images of female celebrities, would email each other stolen photos and videos they had obtained. They would compete for ‘wins’ and see who could get the biggest ‘score’ — depending on the degree of a victim’s fame. To these internet perverts, women were just objects and trophies. It isn’t clear what these men ultimately intended to do with their haul of celebrity porn — amounting possibly to thousands of images of more than 100 actresses, performers and even Olympic athletes. But making money was clearly a possibility and so was blackmail. So far, though, these cyber-thieves have not got much more than a couple of hundred dollars for their sordid activities, and now have the FBI on their tail into the bargain, after one of their number broke rank and started leaking them on to a controversial picture-sharing website last Sunday. Over the past week, it has emerged that at least 400 pictures have been posted online. As for the women stars, they were naturally shocked and humiliated as their Hollywood PRs rushed to condemn the publication of the most intimate contents of their clients’ digital photo albums. The photos and videos were, it is believed, stolen from iCloud — the global system that stores photos and videos recorded on iPhones and other Apple devices. The victims include the Oscar-winning young actress Jennifer Lawrence, ex-Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay, Spiderman heroine Kirsten Dunst, busty supermodel Kate Upton and reality TV phenomenon Kim Kardashian. A list of celebrity names published anonymously online mentions scores more targets including actresses Kate Bosworth and Selena Gomez, singer Rihanna, British models Cara Delevingne and Kelly Brook, and TV presenter Cat Deeley. Some are shown naked, others topless and a few are sexually ‘in flagrante delicto’. One video — reportedly showing Brown Findlay, who played Downton’s Lady Sybil, engaged in somewhat unladylike behaviour — was watched more than a million times online within hours of being posted. Celebrities who are used to controlling their public image with a vice-like grip have had to watch helplessly as millions around the world have been able to access their most private moments. So-called Celebgate began last weekend when someone calling himself ‘OriginalGuy’ posted explicit pictures of Jennifer Lawrence and other stars on a notoriously sordid but influential internet ‘image board’ called 4chan that attracts 12 million visitors a month. The site is used principally by young men, and its guarantee of anonymity (users don’t have to register before posting messages) has seen it described as ‘the ninth circle of Hell’. And yet it was set up by a sweet-faced 15-year-old schoolboy, Christopher Poole, in his New York bedroom in 2003. He wanted to offer a forum for people to put whatever they wanted online with no rules and no fear of prosecution. His business backers in a newer internet venture include some of the founding investors of Google and the news site Huffington Post. In 2009, Poole was voted the world’s most influential person by Time magazine although 4chan users reportedly rigged the poll. His vision of a completely free, unrestricted exchange of information is, after all, what the British computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee envisaged when he invented the World Wide Web. Scroll down for video . Downton Abbey starlet Jessica Brown Findlay (left) and actress Kirsten Dunst (right) were also targeted by hackers . But be careful what you wish for. The original aim for 4chan — as a slightly risque forum for teenagers — soon turned into an internet cesspool as users exploited it to spread the most vile material. In so-called ‘shock posts’, they try to outdo each other in offensiveness. For example, pictures of dead people and car accidents are popular, as is extreme pornography and virulent racism. Despite being the only type of material that is meant to be banned from the site, child porn is regularly posted. ‘Pranks’ have included taunting the family of a suicide victim, starting bomb and school shooting scares, encouraging young fans of the singer Justin Bieber to harm themselves and triggering a false rumour that Apple founder Steve Jobs had died of a heart attack. Anyone who offends the 4chan community or other cheerleaders for the out-of-control internet can expect revenge attacks. Ater the credit card companies Visa and Mastercard stopped handling donations to the whistle-blowing site WikiLeaks, they were targeted by on-line vigilantes who managed to crash their websites. Indeed, many members of the sinister mask-wearing international vigilante hacking group Anonymous started out as 4chan members. Most of 4chan’s most offensive content is posted on its digital message board, called /b/, where members call themselves ‘/b/tards’ and live up to the title with displays of vicious misogyny. Countless pages are devoted to ‘revenge porn’ — once the unpleasant practice of posting publicly compromising photos of an ex-lover, this is now a catch-all term for any compromising photos of women published online without their consent. An even more revolting trend is for so-called ‘creepshots’, in which men try to photograph the bodies of women or girls — often under-age — whom they have seen out in public. Once again, marks are awarded for the most compromising shots. If challenged over why they are allowing pictures that have been taken up a teenager’s skirt, websites like 4chan say it was legal as it occurred in a public place. Revealing photographs of model Kate Upton (left) and reality star Kim Kardashian (right) are also believed to have been obtained by hackers . Most sickeningly, some 4chan users felt the site wasn’t sufficiently pornographic and formed a break-away message board, AnonIB, where hackers calling themselves ‘iCloud rippers’ advertise their services to break into the online account of any woman and download her private photos. The site’s so-called ‘obtained pictures’ section lists the email and iCloud addresses of dozens of women. When a hacker successfully breaks into their account, they notch up ‘win’ and post any embarrassing pictures they find. Experts believe this latest celebrity stalking began in what is known as the Dark Web (or Deep Web or Underweb) a noxious matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity. It has existed for more than a decade and has been used by criminals to deal in drugs, sell weapons and view horrific child pornography. Much of the trade is done with bitcoins, the controversial digital currency which is increasingly used by cyber-criminals to cloak their activities. Users of 4chan’s /b/ messageboard reacted with predictable glee when the leaker of the naked celebrity snaps chose their forum to announce their existence. OriginalGuy, as he calls himself, sought donations in bitcoins from anyone accessing the images. The photos, he said, had been ‘privately traded’ in this currency after being stolen from celebrities’ accounts on iCloud. Subsequently, more pictures appeared on mainstream picture-sharing websites where they were labelled ‘The Fappening’. (‘Fap’ is slang for masturbation.) OriginalGuy has said his group also has an explicit video of Jennifer Lawrence that they are willing to sell. Lawrence and several other victims have admitted the photos are genuine and have threatened to prosecute anyone identified as having posted pictures of them. But internet experts warn that it may be impossible to remove the images from the web permanently. Six days on from the original leak, the identity of the hacker — or it is widely assumed, hackers — remains unclear. In theory, every hacker leaves a ‘digital trail’ and it has been reported that some of them may be as far afield as Holland and the U.S. Mid West. After Apple insisted there had been no widespread breach of its iCloud — if true, a huge relief for the millions of ordinary people who store their photos and other private files on it — it has been suggested that the thieves simply used various trial-and-error techniques to find out specific celebrity email addresses and passwords. Meanwhile, the release of more embarrassing photos and videos is expected. Also, it has emerged that some of the already published photos — of 18-year-old U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney and an MTV actress named Liz Lee — were taken while they were under-age. Cynical users of the website 4chan went on Twitter to encourage girls to post pictures of themselves naked — supposedly to show ‘solidarity’ with Jennifer Lawrence. Reddit, a hugely popular but sleaze-filled internet forum largely owned by Conde Nast, publishers of Vogue and GQ, has been enthusiastically spreading the offending pictures. Sensing a backlash that might damage the parent company’s reputation, its editors urged members to donate to the Prostate Cancer Foundation ‘in honour of Jennifer Lawrence’. But the charity — as soon as it discovered the donations — returned the money, stating publicly that it was considered tainted. Predictably, such an ethical stance did not impress Reddit users, who complained about the charity’s reaction. Severely bruised by the whole experience, celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence and Jessica Brown Findlay will undoubtedly think twice about posing for casual snaps in future. But by unwittingly exposing the rotten, dark heart of the internet, they have done us all a valuable service.","4chan attracts 12million anonymous users a month .

"Imagine a world where it’s never night time; when one sun moves below the horizon another takes its place, providing endless light. This might sound like a sci-fi scenario, but research now suggests that this could be far more common than thought. In fact, up to 50 per cent of stars hosting planets may actually be in binary systems, providing their worlds with odd characteristics not seen in our solar system. Astronomers led by Southern Connecticut State University say that half of all planets in the universe may have two suns. This image shows an artist's concept of the circumbinary planet Kepler-16b - the first planet known to definitively orbit two stars. The cold planet, with its gaseous surface, is not thought to be habitable . The research was carried out by astronomers led by Dr Elliott Horch from Southern Connecticut State University. It had previously been known that binary stars were commonplace, with half the stars in the night sky orbiting at least one other. But it had been unknown how such companion stars affected the formation of planets. Now it seems that such binary systems have little effect, with half of the planets discovered to date by the Kepler space telescope found to be in orbit around binary stars. These are known as circumbinary planets, those that orbit two stars. How these planets come to orbit two stars is unknown, however; it's thought they may be plucked from elsewhere. The team used the WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak in southern Arizona and the Gemini North Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii to make the discovery. The team found that 50 per cent of stars hosting planets were in binary systems. This means more planets than thought are orbiting multiple stars, like the planet Tatooine from Star Wars (shown) which famously had two suns in its sky . The finding was made by observing stars already found to host planets by the Kepler telescope. In this picture is seen the Kepler field of view, located between two bright stars in the summer triangle, rising over the WIYN telescope in southern Arizona . By obtaining digital images of the sky surrounding a star, the team detected companion stars up to 125 times fainter than their target. To date, nearly all planets found outside the solar system have followed a strict naming convention, which has led to rather complicated names such as the world OGLE235-MOA53 b. That’s all set to change later this year, though, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) will allow the public to vote on the names of exoplanets for the first time. A list of 305 confirmed planets found before 31 December 2008 has been drawn up, and in October names can be submitted for consideration for some of the planets. In March 2015 the public will be allowed to vote on the proposed names and in August 2015 the results will be announced at a ceremony in Honolulu. The names of planets will coexist alongside their existing scientific names, just like what is done for other celestial bodies now. For example the Orion Nebula is also scientifically known as Messier 42. This equated to stars ranging in distance from 100 times the Earth-sun distance to just a few times this distance. And in the study they found that about 50 per cent of stars with planets in orbit around them were actually in a binary system. ‘It’s interesting and exciting that exoplanet systems with stellar companions turn out to be much more common than was believed even just a few years ago,’ said Dr Horch. And another intriguing conclusion of the study is that, for any given circumbinary planet, it is difficult to work out which star it is orbiting. Co-author of the study, Dr. Steve Howell of Nasa Ames Research Center, said: 'An interesting consequence of this finding is that in the half of the exoplanet host stars that are binary we can not, in general, say which star in the system the planet actually orbits.' While some planets may resemble Tatooine from Star Wars, with two bright suns in the sky, other circumbinary planets in wide orbits around their stars may simply have one unusually bright star among others in their sky in addition to their sun. 'Somewhere there will be a transition between these two scenarios, but we are far from knowing where,' added Dr Howell. Nasa's Kepler space telescope, illustrated, has been the most successful planet-hunting observatory to date. It orbits around the sun 40 million miles (64 million km) from Earth and is named after 17th Century astronomer Johannes Kepler. It was launched in 2009 with the sole purpose of finding new stars and planets .","Astronomers led by Southern Connecticut State University say that half of all planets in the universe may have two suns .

"A flurry of solar flares has been spotted on the sun by a Nasa telescope. In just one day more than half a dozen were spotted, in addition to several ejections of material. Videos and images show the explosions in all their glory as material races from the sun’s surface into the surrounding space. Scroll down for video . According to Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) team a single, dynamic active region unleashed over half a dozen solar flares in about 24 hours from 25 to 26 August. The two larger flares were M-class (moderate) flares and the others were smaller flares. This animation shows an ejection associated with the flares . Solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost. Astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission. They do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks. The charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the Earth’s magnetic field. Very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies. A positive aspect, from an aesthetic point of view, is that the auroras are enhanced. Geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents. The event was captured by Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory from 25 to 26 August. Two larger flares seen were moderate explosions known as M-class flares, while the others were smaller flares. Some of the images were taken in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light, which is ideal for observing flares. The eruptions began with an explosive mid-level M5 flare. The flares originated from a sunspot called AR2151, an intense region of magnetic activity on the sun’s surface. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, but thanks to Earth’s atmosphere they pose little threat to people on the planet’s surface. However intense flares can be known to disrupt satellites in Earth orbit. Periods of intense solar activity can result in bigger and more visible auroras, as more solar wind interacts with particles in the atmosphere. The flare under study can be seen on the middle-left of the sun in this image. Solar flares are releases of intense high-energy radiation from the sun, which we see as a bright light. They are sometimes accompanied by an emission of material known as a coronal mass ejections (CME) One of the flares as spotted by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) can be seen up close here. Periods of intense solar activity can result in bigger and more visible auroras, as more solar wind interacts with particles in Earth's atmosphere . According to Noaa’s Space Weather Prediction Centre this particular event, while impressive, the flares didn’t pose much threat to our planet. ‘Given the location of this event, the associated coronal mass ejection is well off the sun-Earth line and no significant geomagnetic storming is anticipated as a result,’ they reported. ‘Region 2151 had a history of M-class flare production on its previous rotation. ‘This event is indicative of an uptick in activity from relatively quiet conditions as of late, though. ‘The sun is currently peppered with relatively small regions, all of which are unlikely producers of severe activity at this time.’ Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), artist's illustration shown, has has been in a distant Earth orbit since 11 February 2010. It will observe the sun until at least 2015, after which its mission could be extended. Its goal is to understand the influence of the sun on Earth and surrounding space by monitoring its atmosphere .","Nasa researchers in California say the sun has gone through a period of increased solar activity .

"New Zealand won the third Test against Pakistan by an innings and 80 runs at Sharjah to draw the three-match series 1-1. The Black Caps posted a record 690 to take a first-innings lead of 339, steered to that commanding position by Brendon McCullum's double century and 192 from Kane Williamson. Trent Boult then ripped through Pakistan's top order and Asad Shafiq's 137 proved nothing more than an entertaining delay as New Zealand eased to victory. New Zealand paceman Trent Boult appeals successfully for the LBW wicket of Pakistan's Younis Khan . Black Caps embrace after claiming the Test victory by an innings and 80 runs in Sharjah . The players emerged to start the day's play wearing black armbands on what would have been Phillip Hughes' 26th birthday following his tragic death this week. With Tim Southee having departed to the final ball on day three, Ish Sodhi joined Mark Craig at the crease for New Zealand and the latter soon brought up his half-century with a six off Yasir Shah. Another six from Craig moved the Black Caps to 680 and with a single off the next ball they brought up their highest ever innings total, surpassing the 680 for eight declared against India earlier this year. Craig then fell to the final ball of the over as he presented Mohammad Hafeez with a simple caught and bowled to fall for 65 off 85 balls. Brendan McCullum, who scored a first innings 202, readies his hands to grasp the catch that finish the Test . A six from Sodhi produced a record 88th boundary of the innings from New Zealand and when he fell caught at slip off Shah for 22, the innings was over. Pakistan's response began badly with Shan Masood falling for just four, edging Boult to Southee at third slip. Boult had a second victim soon after as he bowled Azhar Ali for six, and when Younis Khan was lbw for a duck off the first ball of the paceman's next over, he was on a hat-trick. Misbah-ul-Haq left the next delivery alone outside off and he and Hafeez guided the home side through to 30 for three at lunch. The experienced pair were likely to be Pakistan's only hope of saving the match but when Hafeez was caught and bowled by Craig for 24 in just the second over after the break, their prospects were looking dire. Pakistani batsman Asad Shafiq (left) hugs Rahat Ali after reaching second innings century . Misbah and Shafiq steadied the innings to an extent but the captain was gone for 12 when he got the thinnest of gloves to a Craig delivery and BJ Watling took the catch behind the stumps. Shafiq and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 73 for the sixth wicket with Shafiq bringing up his fifty from 78 balls but the partnership was ended when Ross Taylor took a smart catch off Sodhi at first slip to remove Sarfraz for 37. Yasir strode out and hit his first two balls for a four and a six but was gone to the fourth he faced, trapped in front by Sodhi. New Zealand captain McCullum (centre) and Misbah-ul-Haq (right) hold the series they now share . Daniel Vettori had been recalled to the New Zealand Test team for the first time since July 2012 and he got among the wickets by removing Mohammad Talha lbw for 19 to leave Pakistan 180 for eight. Shafiq clearly saw that as an invitation to open up his shoulders as he began to find the boundary at will and brought up his century off 123 balls. He and Rahat Ali put on 78, with Shafiq supplying 72 of them, before the latter fell for a 148-ball 137 which included 18 fours and six sixes, Boult claiming his fourth wicket. Rahat was the last man to go for six when he holed out to McCullum off Craig.","New Zealand beat Pakistan by an innings and 80 runs levels series at 1-1 .

"It is a symbol of division derisively known as the 'death strip' which once separated east and west. But now, 25 years after its collapse, the Berlin Wall has become something of a unifying influence in the city's booming property market. As the anniversary of the fall of the Wall in 1989 approaches, Berlin is belatedly attracting the kind of wealth normally associated with the capital of a major economic power. A fluke of history means the city has a . supply of vacant lots in coveted central locations along the Wall built . by East Germany's communists to keep capitalism at bay.

Michael Ries of the property developer Pantera which is behind The Garden project (above) said: 'Clients, international and German alike, value living on historical ground' For many wealthy investors, its history is the big attraction, although some . developers are wary of being too brazenly commercial about this.

That same history has led to a less-than-linear growth path for Berlin's property market in the last quarter-century. Boom time: Property developer Nikolaus Ziegert says Berlin has emerged as a safe investment destination in the wake of the financial crisis . Prime real estate: Men walk past the construction of luxury lofts. On the anniversary of the fall of the Wall in 1989, the city is belatedly attracting the kind of wealth normally associated with the capital of a major power .

Iconic structure with chequered history: Germans from East and West stand on the Berlin Wall in front of the Brandenburg Gate a day after the wall was opened in November 1989 . 'For the longest time, it was just not worth buying here. 'This changed once Germany and Berlin emerged as a safe business location and investment destination in the wake of the economic and financial crisis,' said Nikolaus Ziegert, whose consultancy has a 17.5 per cent slice of the luxury market. Economy Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has warned of the danger of a German property price bubble and the central bank has said apartments in some urban locations are over-valued by up to 25 per cent. But the financial watchdog sees no evidence of this and Berlin itself seems to be years away from any such risk.

Hidden history: Sculptures on display in the windows of the former Karl Marx Academy that is being converted into luxury flats. The brochure does not mention its past as a training centre for communist cadres . 'Only if this price increase continues for years and years would we approach something close to a property bubble in Berlin,' said Franz Eilers, head of research at the VDP mortgage bank association. Last year 220 luxury condominiums were sold in Berlin, up from 185 in previous years, according to a report by consultancy bulwiengesa for Ziegert. International clients now make up half of the buyers in the luxury market, said Ries. Dubbed the 'epicenter of cool' and 'Brooklyn on the Spree' river by the foreign press, Berlin is seeing economic growth to match its trendy reputation. Its output grew 1.7 per cent in 2013, higher than the German national average. Work in progress: George Darbishire of Ziegert Property walks past a model room in a floor of the Metropol Park development that will be turned into a loft in Berlin . Modernisation: Men work in a 19th century house that is being turned into a luxury apartment as investors show increasing confidence in the property market after the financial crisis . Compared to London, New York and Paris, the Berlin market is still in its infancy. An exclusive complex, like Ziegert's Lux, is rare. It is more common to have a few luxury flats rub shoulders with normally priced ones, as in Pantera's The Garden. Legal disputes are often behind the long delays in building along the Wall's route. Not all developers agree that the Cold War history is a valid selling point. Annette Mischler of the Groth Group sees it as 'artificially resurrecting history' to put it in promotional material but Ries at Pantera said it would be to 'ignore important history if we didn't'. The Wall is not the only historical association on Berlin's luxury property market. Film enthusiasts can now buy one of 220 lofts in Ziegert's red-bricked Metropol Park, named for the Fritz Lang movie masterpiece 'Metropolis' of 1927. The most expensive flat in the complex went for 1.3 million euros (1.75 million). The brochures did not mention its past role as the Karl Marx Academy where communist cadres were trained, though it does add to the 'aura' of the building, the Ziegert consultancy's Schlueter said. Expansion: Economy Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has warned of the danger of a German property price bubble, but the financial watchdog sees no evidence of this . A show room loft in Berlin: Compared to London, New York and Paris, the Berlin market is still in its infancy . Eva Maria Fallenberg, 42, a radiologist hunting for an apartment in Berlin, said such matters were 'not a priority' in her search but she was drawn to the Metropol complex's 'rich history', though she decided against buying there. 'I really liked the project's efforts to preserve and restore the exterior of the building, unlike projects by the Wall Park and the East Side Gallery,' she said, referring to two of the tourist landmarks along the route of the Berlin Wall. A 600-apartment project by the Wall Park, a former border strip turned into a park with live music and a flea market that attract about 50,000 people each weekend, has locals up in arms - part of an anti-gentrification backlash in a city better known for squatters and struggling artists than plush condominiums. 'The argument that they're helping the community by building much-needed new apartments is ridiculous,' said Alexander Puell, a 39-year-old member of the Wall Park Friends Association. 'Yes, we need a lot of new apartments, but there is no shortage of luxury apartments, what we need is socially responsible investment appropriate to this neighborhood,' Puell said as he promoted recycling at a school near the Wall Park. The Groth Group, which owns the site, said the plan is for middle-class housing, but for locals like Puell luxury begins much lower than the official definition of 5,000 euros ($6,700) per square metre. Parallel protests against a luxury project at the East Side Gallery, a 1.3-km section of the Wall covered with paintings, suggest there is a 'slowly crystallising network of Berliners concerned about city development', Puell said.","Berlin attracting investors on the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Wall .

"Getting rid of bad smells in a bathroom can be a tricky business, with some opting to install a fan or use candles and sprays. But a new invention claims to be able to more quickly remove odours so that the toilet stays smelling clean and fresh. Called Fresh Air Plus, this odour-eliminating toilet seat aims to eliminate unsavoury smells by pumping them outside. Scroll down for video . An inventor in Tennessee has revealed his odour-eliminating toilet seat. Called Fresh Air Plus (shown) the device has a built-in fan to get rid of bad smells. When a person sits on it a sensor triggers a fan inside the bowl, which filters any unpleasant odours away . First, you'll need to remove your old toilet seat by undoing its screws. Then, after removing your current seat and the screws that hold it on, simply place the Fresh Air Plus on your toilet. The seat is ready to go as soon as you plug it in the nearest outlet. The last part is running the hose to the outside. To do this, you need to drill a hole in the wall behind the toilet with a drill bit and widen it with a wood eater bit. Then pass the Fresh Air Hose through the silver finish and stick it into the hole. You will need to repeat the same hole on the outside of the house to run the hose all the way to the outdoors. Fresh Air Plus was invented by Adam Payz from Nashville, Tennessee and is currently seeking £50,000 ($80,000) of funding on Kickstarter. The detachable seat can be placed on top of existing toilets when the old seat is removed. When a person sits on it a sensor triggers a fan inside the bowl, which filters any unpleasant odours away. The odours are taken through a hose away from the toilet and outside the house. To power the fan the seat needs to be plugged into a wall socket. One issue for potential owners, though, might be that a ventilation hole needs to be drilled in the side of the house to feed the hose outside. For people with houses made of something stronger than wood, this may be somewhat of a problem. But the company claims their solution is the best way to avoid embarrassing smells lurking in bathrooms. ‘Traditional ceiling odour-removal fans are an inefficient solution because they allow odours to permeate into the room before removing,’ the company writes . ‘They also suck out heated and cooled air, causing you to lose money on your utilities. ‘Air fresheners are just a mask for odours, and often make what you’ve done in the restroom even more obvious. ‘Fresh Air Plus makes having people over (even that special someone) worry-free.’ The . fan is triggered when a person sits down (shown). The odours are taken . through a hose away from the toilet and outside the house. One issue for . potential owners, though, might be that a ventilation hole needs to be . drilled in the side of the house to feed the hose outside . The detachable seat is easily installed in place of existing seats. They claim it gets rid of smells better than other fans, sprays or candles. This can make using the bathroom more pleasant for the next person to walk in. It is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter to launch in March 2015 .","An inventor in Tennessee has revealed his odour-eliminating toilet seat .

"A picture has emerged of the British businessman and his Saudi wife who were attacked by religious police officers for using a women-only till at a Riyadh supermarket. It comes as the couple revealed that they have received an apology for the incident from the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, the official name for the organisation to which the officers belonged. Shocking video footage appeared online that showed Peter Howarth-Lees and his Saudi-born wife, Abeer al-Fouti, being set upon by members of the religious police, also known as the Mutawa, outside a supermarket in an upmarket area of the Saudi capital. Scroll down for video . Attacked: Peter Howarth-Lees and his Saudi-born wife, Abeer al-Fouti, were set upon by members of the religious police in Riyadh. They are pictured here at the Just Like Us premiere during the 2010 Doha Tribeca Film Festival at the Katara Opera House in Qatar . In the video, after a woman appears to intervene, Mr Howarth-Lees, can be heard shouting 'That's my wife, how dare you.' Mr Howarth-Lees, a Muslim convert who runs a business called Smile Productions, was attacked after members of the Mutawa followed him out of the shop, The Telegraph has reported. A statement apparently written by Mr Howarth-Lees and posted on to a local website describes how he and his wife were directed to the female cashier before three men approached them and objected. Assault: Footage shows members of the religious police, also known as the Mutawa, jumping on Mr Howarth-Lees . He said the couple were harassed by the men, despite the cashier's assertion that the customers were a family, before the argument spilled out into the car park after they had paid for their goods. He said he was thrown to the ground when he tried to take a picture of the Mutawa members as evidence for a complaint after noticing one of them taking pictures of his car. He said: 'While I was on the ground all three of them proceeded to kick me repeatedly in the head and back and then one of them stamped hard on my face.' His wife then got out of the car before one of the men, apparently as seen in the video, climbed on to a car and jumped on to father-of-three Mr Howarth-Lees. The incident finally came to an end after the couple were rescued by guards from the British Embassy and driven away. They had called the local police, but they refused to help. Mr Howarth-Lees said he was thrown to the ground when he tried to take a picture of the Mutawa members as evidence for a complaint after noticing one of them taking pictures of his car . The incident took place outside a supermarket in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia (file picture) Mr Howarth-Lees told The Times that he had received an apology from the Mutawa and that the officers who had attacked him had been ‘administratively punished’. The Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is the Saudi Arabian government's religious police to enforce Sharia Law within the Islamic nation. Altogether, it has 3,500 to 4,000 police officers who enforce a strict religious code among citizens. Members patrol the streets checking dress code, strict separation of men and women, salat prayer by Muslims during prayer times, and other behaviour it believes to be commanded by Islam. The Mutawa are known for having full beards and wearing their headscarves (ghutrah or shemagh) loose without an agal and often come from Saudi Arabia's lower classes. The body has widespread powers to detain and berate offenders and shut down businesses and are employed directly by the King. The organisation's 2013 budget was the equivalent of $390million. In May this year it was reported that five Saudi men had been sentenced to 32 years in prison and 4,500 lashes by a criminal court in Saudi Arabia for holding a Valentine's Day party. The men were caught at a rented rest house in the Al-Farouq area of Buraidah Qassim province and accused of holding a party with women who were unrelated to them, drinking and dancing. Mutawa members rounded up the men with the help of security patrols for their offences along with six women on February 14.","Peter Howarth-Lees and his wife attacked by religious police in Saudi Arabia .

"Graeme McDowell will take a glorious trip down memory lane next week to ensure he is in the right frame of mind for this year’s Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. The 35-year-old Northern Irishman has added the Wales Open at Celtic Manor to his schedule and so will warm up for this year’s match at the venue where he holed the winning putt in 2010. ‘I’ve got so many happy memories there,’ he said. ‘I also won the Wales Open at Celtic Manor in 2010 as well as enjoying my time at the Ryder Cup, so it will certainly get the juices flowing a bit. Happy return: McDowell sealed a home win for Europe at Celtic Manor in 2010 and will play there again . Getting into the swing: McDowell hopes to find his best form at the course ahead of Gleneagles . 'My thinking is that I want to know the state of my game. I don’t want to take a week off and be thinking: “What if?” I want to be sharp because you know by Tuesday at Gleneagles you are playing for your place in the starting line-up.’ McDowell made it into the side via automatic qualifying by the skin of his teeth over Stephen Gallacher to create a record he is justifiably proud about. ‘I’m the only man to play in the last four Ryder Cups without needing a wildcard pick, so I will give myself a pat on the back for that,’ he said. ‘It certainly makes a difference to make it off my own efforts, even if the margin was tiny. There’s more pressure if you’re a wildcard, although it never seems to do Ian Poulter any harm! ‘But it has been an amazing qualifying period for me, for so many reasons. Off the course, I got married when it started last September and it has ended with me becoming a parent. I won the French Open in July and now I have got the Ryder Cup so it has been a brilliant summer.’ Great year: McDowell's marriage and first child have added to Ryder Cup qualification in a good year . McDowell watched Gallacher’s valiant effort to pip him for the last automatic spot at the Italian Open last week with mixed emotions. ‘I thought with four or five holes to go Stevie was going to make it and I felt for him when he didn’t,’ he said. ‘I was so pleased when he got a pick. It would have been devastating to get so close and not make the team, and particularly given it is in Scotland. How special to play in a Ryder Cup in your home country? Not many players get to experience that. I know I won’t.’ McDowell took last week off for the birth of his first child and mum Kristin and daughter Vale are doing well. Understandably, he had the air of a distracted man for the first two rounds of the BMW Championship here and was well down the field at halfway. ‘I guess it’s not too surprising I’ve not been at the races and it has been one long physical letdown,’ he said. With little chance now of qualifying for the FedEx Cup finale in Atlanta that starts on Thursday, McDowell will seek to recapture his form in Wales the following week. As for the Ryder Cup, he could not help but reflect he has packed an awful lot into his three appearances to date. ‘I’ve certainly ridden that Ryder Cup rollercoaster,’ he smiled. ‘I have experienced all the emotions the contest can throw up. I’ve hit the first and last shot, I’ve won on both sides of the Atlantic, and I’ve been on a losing side.’ Super Macs: McDowell and McIlroy celebrate after Medinah and will play together again at Gleneagles . McDowell wasn’t at his formidable match play best and contributed little to the Medinah miracle in 2012 but is determined things will be different this time. ‘I’m ready to go to Gleneagles and enjoy it, and that’s not always the case with the Ryder Cup,’ he said. ‘You can get too wrapped up with the pressure. I didn’t enjoy it last time because I was washed up mentally, having played too much in the build-up.’ Europe captain Paul McGinley told Sportsmail in July we will see the celebrated pairing of G-Mac and ‘Wee Mac’ at some point, even if the friendship of McDowell and Rory McIIroy has been strained for the past year. McIlroy has been involved in an ugly legal wrangle with his former management group Horizon Sports, who also look after McDowell, and the latter has felt caught in the middle. McDowell himself will now be leaving Horizon at the end of the year, albeit on more amicable terms, and it would come as no surprise if he and Rory start rebuilding bridges. And where better to start than Gleneagles, reviving their awesome combination of old and cutting down some Americans. That would help any friendship along, wouldn’t it?","McDowell sank the winning putt during the 2010 Ryder Cup in Wales .

"The beds are still made and ready for guests, despite having been abandoned more than 20 years ago. Traces of the lives of the long-departed masters of the house can be found in every room. Chateau de la Foret, in Belgium, has been unoccupied since the 1990s and now a photographer who ventured inside the derelict castle has released these spooky photographs of its decaying interiors. The castle is full of antique furniture, crystal chandeliers and even dusty old clothes. The walls of the grand chateau are adorned with oil paintings, moth-eaten tapestries and crumbling frescoes. Opulent: The drawing room is filled with antique furniture and an enormous tapestry fills the whole of one wall, while the chandelier hints at an opulent past . Ravaged by time: A bedroom with the bed still made up and covered in chunks of fallen ceiling, and antique furniture left to decay - traces of the lives of the former tenants can be found in every room . Lavish interiors: The marble stairs and walls in the hallway look almost untouched by time, although the rest of the castle has more obvious signs of decay . The grand building has fallen into disrepair since the owner died and left the castle to his descendents, who cannot decide on who should live there. Urban explorer Maikal Goossens, 21, of Turnhout, Belgium, photographed the lavish interior of the forsaken chateau. 'When I entered the chateau it was like being teleported back in time - everything was well preserved,' he said. 'I could hear the sound of wood creaking when I walked over it. Every sound I made was amplified by the space in the enormous rooms. Forgotten tomes: Books in the chateau's library spill off the shelves and consume every surface. What gems could be found here? The sound of silence: A shaft of sunlight falls onto a pair of decaying chairs in on of the chateau's many rooms, left.  Right: Where did those feet in ancient time? A slowly decaying spiral stone staircase within one of the chateau's four corner towers lead upwards to the roof and turrets . Imposing: The grand building has been allowed to fall into disrepair since the owner died 20 years ago and left the castle to his descendents They cannot decide on who should live there and the place decays further by the year . An ornate circular room with two tapestries hanging in it. The opulent chateau, in Moulbaix, western Belgium, has 344 windows and is surrounded by 62 acres of land . Sad sight: A store room in the basement of the chateau is piled high with abandoned possessions, left. Right, the craftsmanship is clear in the marble stairs and hallway . 'At first it was pretty scary walking around in there, but I got used to it.' The grand castle is completed by four corner towers and is fortified by four octagonal turrets on top of the towers. The opulent chateau, in Moulbaix, Hainaut, western Belgium, has 344 windows and is surrounded by 62 acres of land. Mr Goossens, who works in an ice cream factory, said, 'I was amazed every time I opened a door and found what was in the room behind it. Bygone times: An antique clock and selection of taxidermy birds sit on a mantlepiece in one of the vast living rooms . Cobwebs galore: A store room in the basement of the chateau is filled with old furniture, ornaments... and a religious icon hides behind a decaying valise . 'There was a large vault and a secret staircase which led from the bathroom to the library. The dining room was very well decorated with chandeliers and a big tapestry. 'The main entrance was made of marble including the whole main staircase - it was incredible.' The original building was built in 1502, but much of the original house and feudal fortress was replaced in 1860 by the current building. The current castle was built in a neo-Tudor style by the order of the Marquis Du Chasteler Oswald. It was left to the descendants of Count d'Ursel Aymard, who reportedly cannot decide on a single owner, so the buidling has been left to fall into disrepair.","Chateau de la Foret, in Belgium, has been unoccupied since the 1990s .

"Melvin Clary was a man obsessed with everything about the ocean. A deep sea fisherman from Livermore, California, 'Mel' loved to go abalone hunting with his two sons and explore the tide pools at Fitzgerald Marine Reserve with the rest of the family. So when he passed away earlier this month, he not only wanted to be laid to rest in the ocean - he wanted his memory to be cast out to sea. And so on August 17, Mel's loved ones bottled up a message written on his behalf in a special airtight container, according to My Modern Met. After spreading his ashes in Half Moon Bay, the bottle was sent out on the waves. Much-loved: Melvin Clary is seen here i hospital surrounded by his family before his death . Heartwarming: The family of Melvin Clary wanted to do something special in his honor . Out to sea: His ashes were dropped into the ocean at Half Moon Bay in California .

"It was a wild roller-coaster ride on Wall Street Wednesday as US stocks plunged in afternoon trading before recovering some of the losses at the close. Investors dumped risky assets in heavy trading and parked their money in investments seen as relatively safe, such as US government bonds. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped as much as 460 points in afternoon trading, then clawed back much of the ground it lost. It ended down 173 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 16,141. A zipper on the side of One Times Square announces a stock selloff on Wall Street . Nosedive: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the start of the trading day in New York Wednesday, when the Dow Jones shed 350 points in early trading . The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 15 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,862. The Nasdaq fell 11 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 4,215. A late-afternoon recovery erased much of the historic losses. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are now slightly higher for the year. The about-face came just hours after both the Dow and the S&P experienced the worst mid-day trading in nearly three years as investor fears of a global economic slowdown intensified after several weeks of turbulent market action, exacerbated by growing concerns over the ongoing Ebola outbreak. The Dow plunged as much as 460 points following steep declines in Europe as investors sized up the latest batch of corporate earnings and some discouraging US economic news. The Dow was heading for its biggest percentage drop since June 2013. Could've been worse: The Dow clawed back much of the ground it lost, ending down 173 points . The drop was also the index's largest mid-day loss since September 22, 2011, when the Dow shed 552 points. Traders dumped risky assets and parked their money in investments seen as relatively safe, such as US government bonds. That pushed the yield on the 10-year Treasury note briefly below 2 per cent, the lowest level in more than a year. 'It's a function of the US being the best house in a bad neighborhood,' said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 'There's still uncertainty about economic growth, primarily on a global basis."" The Dow recovered some of the ground it had lost in the first half-hour of trading then fell steadily again through the afternoon before inching back up by the time the closing bell sounded. Bond prices soared as investors shifted money into safe-haven investments. Early on, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note plunged to 1.91 per cent from 2.20 per cent the day before, or 29 basis points, a huge move. It recovered to 2.01 per cent in afternoon trading. Bond yields fall when their prices rise. Downward spiral: The Dow plunged as much as 460 points, heading for its biggest percentage drop since June 2013. Bad day: By 3pm Wednesday, the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 43 points, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,834 . 'It typically takes weeks for 10-year Treasurys to move 29 basis points,' noted Tom Di Galoma, head of fixed income rates in New York at ED&F Man Capital. 'Today it moved 29 basis points in 5 minutes.' Wednesday's slide brings the stock market closer to a correction, which happens when a benchmark index like the S&P 500 falls 10 per cent or more from a recent peak. The S&P 500 hit its most recent peak of 2,011.36 on September 18. It would have to close at 1,810.22 to mark a correction. The last time that happened was October 2011. The correction threshold for the Dow is 15,551. The Nasdaq's is 4,138. The Nasdaq traded below that threshold on Wednesday and could match the widely accepted definition of being in a correction if it closes below that point. Parts of the market are already in correction, which has some analysts calling for caution. Small-company stocks, as measured by the Russell 2000 index, have fallen 12.8 per cent since hitting a peak in July and are down 9.5 per cent for the year. Many market watchers say occasional corrections are a healthy phenomenon over the long term and give investors an opportunity to add to their holdings at a lower cost. 'That's why it' so important to stay invested at a time like this, rather than think it's a time to get out,' said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones. Happy end: Trader Peter Tuchman watches a screen above the floor of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the closing bell . On the precipice: Wednesday's slide brings the stock market closer to a correction, which happens when a benchmark index like the S&P 500 falls 10 per cent or more from a recent peak . Jittery: Investor fears of a global economic slowdown intensified after several weeks of turbulent market action, exacerbated by growing concerns over the ongoing Ebola outbreak . Stocks have been declining for nearly a month as investors have grown increasingly nervous about whether global growth is slowing. While the US economy remains in recovery mode, investors are concerned that corporate earnings growth will slow this year and next due to a slowdown in Europe and, to a lesser degree, China. Investors got more discouraging news early Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reported that retail sales declined 0.3 per cent in September from the previous month. Purchases of autos, gasoline, furniture and clothing slowed. Retail sales have risen 4.3 per cent over the past 12 months, slightly below their historical pace. A snapshot of manufacturing activity didn't bolster optimism. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Empire State Manufacturing index dropped sharply from 27.5 to 6.2 in October as new orders shrank and shipments barely rose. The latest reading marks the slowest pace of growth in six months. All 10 sectors in the S&P 500 declined, led by financial stocks, which slid 3.6 per cent. KeyCorp, Regions Financial, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup were among the biggest decliners. Covidien led the slide among S&P 500 companies, falling $8.36, or 9.1 per cent, to $83.96. Bucking the trend were several energy companies, including Cabot Oil & Gas, Southwest Energy and EQT Corp. Cabot paced the gainers, rising 95 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $29.43. Several homebuilders surged, getting a lift from the slide in the 10-year Treasury bond yield, which affects rate on consumer and business loans. A decline in the 10-year Treasury note yield should nudge mortgage rates lower, spurring home sales. M/I Homes got the biggest boost among the builders, adding 43 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $19.65. As more companies report earnings over the next couple of weeks, investors should get a better read of the impact that the economic situation overseas will have on US companies. US crude oil slipped 23 cents to $81.61 a barrel.","The Dow plunged as much as 460 points Wednesday afternoon, heading for its biggest percentage drop since June 2013 .

"Raking it in: Even after having his salary slashed by 36%, Lee Hsien Loong will still earn $1.7m a year . Singapore's Prime Minister has reacted to public anger over income inequality by taking a 36 per cent pay cut - but is still one of the world's best paid political leaders. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has had his salary reduced by over a third after public fury over soaring housing costs and increased pay inequality. The Singapore leader is still earning $1.7million a year (£1.089m) as the world's best paid leader however, over four times the salary of U.S. president Barack Obama. The U.S. president, leader of a . country of 312million people in comparison to Singapore's 5.1million, . earns around $400,000 (£256,000). And . the pay packet of the Singapore leader dwarfs that of British Prime . Minister David Cameron, who earns $222,000 a year (£142,000). The move in Singapore came after Prime Minister Lee said today he will accept the recommendations of a government-appointed committee to reduce his salary, as well as those of his ministers and the city-state's president. The committee - appointed by Lee following a disastrous parliamentary election in which his party faced historic losses - recommended that Lee's salary be cut 36 percent to 2.2 million Singapore dollars ($1.7 million). Prime Minister Lee's salary is four times that of Barack Obama and eight times that of David Cameron . Lee has served as Prime Minister of the prosperous city-state since 2004. President Tony Tan faces even tougher times, with a potentially staggering 51 percent salary cut. Still, observers might consider him well-paid at SG$1.5 million for a ceremonial post. LEE HSIEN LOONG (Singapore)$1.7m p/a (£1.089m)DONALD TSANG (Hong Kong)$543,500 (£348,000)YOSHIHIKO NODA (Japan)$513,000 (£329,000)BARACK OBAMA (USA)$400,000 (£256,000)JULIA GILLARD (Australia)$379,000 (£243,000)NICOLAS SARKOZY (France)$302,000 (£193,000)ANGELA MERKEL (German)$296,000 (£189,000)DAVID CAMERON (UK PM)$222,000 (£142,000) Salaries for government ministers will be reduced by 37 percent to an annual SG$1.1 million. Prime Minister Lee's wage is comfortably bigger than that of any other world leader. French President Nicolas Sarkozy collects $302,000 (£193,000) and German Chancellor Angela Merkel earns $296,000 (£189,000). Gerard Ee, chairman of the remuneration committee, said parliament will debate the recommendations later this month. However, Lee, in a letter to the committee, said he will accept the new salaries. Lee's ruling People's Action Party won parliamentary elections in May, with its lowest overall vote total since independence in 1965. The salaries of Singapore's leaders soared in the 1990s when they were benchmarked to an average of the highest private sector pay in Singapore. Singapore's leaders had long justified their high salaries by insisting they were necessary to attract the best managerial and leadership talent to public service.","Lee Hsien Loong earns four times the salary of Obama and eight times wage of Cameron .

"If you have ever been embarrassed by an unflattering or too revealing picture posted online, Snapchat, a new iPhone app, could be the answer to your prayers. Enter: the self-destructing photograph. Snapchat was born after two undergraduates at the American university, Stanford, noticed their friends frantically deleting incriminating or unsuitable photos from their Facebook accounts just before going on a job interview or on a date. Their app allows users to take a photo and send it to friends, but the recipient can only look at the photo for a few seconds before it self-destructs - leaving no digital trace. He needs Snapchat! U.S. Congressman Anthony Weiner sent lewd pictures of himself to a 21-year-old student via Twitter. Unfortunately, he also managed to tweet them to everyone else too. The app could also come to the rescue of the many celebs caught out by the sexting trend, which has seen the likes of Rihanna and Democratic Congressman, Anthony Weiner, reveal much more than expected to the public. Other celebrities who probably wish they had Snapchat include Twilight actress Ashley Greene, whose topless photos were splashed across the internet when her email inbox was hacked, Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively and Vanessa Hudgens. Even Prince Harry was left red-faced, after a fellow party-goer snapped him in the nude during a game of strip billiards earlier this year. But if you're hoping Snapchat is the answer to all of your pictorial woes, be warned: there's a glitch. Unscientific testing conducted by the Daily Mail revealed that fast-fingered iPhone users can save a screen grab of the image before it self-destructs, so long as they're within the time limit set by the sender. Perhaps it might be better to think twice before sending that risque text after all....

"England captain Wayne Rooney was delighted with the patience shown by his side as they caught Switzerland twice on the counter to win 2-0 and get off the mark in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. Switzerland are expected to be England's closest competitors in Group E, but Danny Welbeck's double gave England an early headstart in the race to qualify.

We caught them on the break with speed and Dan got two great goals so I'm really delighted.' Arsenal new boy Welbeck notched his first international goals for more than a year, first tapping home after an exquisite ball across the box from Raheem Sterling, before showing great composure and awareness to calmly slot past stranded Swiss keeper Yann Sommer in the dying moments. The former Manchester United forward felt that his goals were ultimately just rewards for the work ethic shown by England. Opener: Welbeck pounced at the back stick to put England ahead after the break . 'I think we created a number of chances which maybe we could have done better with the final pass. Once we got the first goal I think we were in control and played a good team game today and you could see the work ethic - everyone is playing for each other and that's very important,' he said. The 23-year-old could not hide his delight after scoring his fine second goal, but was quick to praise those who worked hard to provide him with the opportunity. 'Obviously we've sat back a little bit deeper and we've got the pace to get in behind them so once they went Raz (Sterling) took the ball down the wing, played it into Rickie (Lambert) and then I knew he had the ability to slide me in and thankfully he did that,' he added.

"Walking dogs in public or driving them around in cars is set to be banned in Iran. Now dog owners fear their pets will be 'arrested' if they are caught in public and they could also face a fine. It is the latest attempted crackdown on dogs in the country, where the animals are viewed as unclean. Dog-owners such as Shohreh (pictured) fear losing their beloved pets in the latest clampdown . In 2011, authorities threatened to criminalise dog ownership and said the growing popularity of keeping the pets 'poses a cultural problem, blind imitation of the vulgar Western culture'. Deputy police chief Ahmad Reza Radan told the Fars news agency that they 'will confront those who walk . their dogs in the streets. Cars carrying dogs will also be impounded.' However the Iranian Society for the . Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has questioned whether this is illegal . and said that now law forbids dog ownership, according to AFP. It said dozens of dogs had been 'arrested' and were taken to 'undisclosed locations'. According to animal supporters, this crackdown is more series than previous attempts. Payam . Mohebi, a pet hospital chief from Tehran, was quoted as saying: 'Owners . are being told that their dogs will be killed, and no paper (confirming . the confiscation) is given to them.' Dog will have to be walked at night or exercised in garden by their owners (pictured Iranian Golnaz) Dog owners are now walking their pets at night to avoid detection. In June 2010 Grand Ayatollah Naser . Makarem Shirzi warned that dog ownership would lead to family . corruption and damage societal values. 'Many people in the West love their dogs more than their wives and children,' he said. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance then banned all media from publishing adverts about pets, according to AFP. Despite the threats, sales of dogs are still booming. Pet shop owners and vets said sales of dogs have risen sharply in recent years. Dogs will be confined to houses even more under the clampdown. Pictured engineer Azar and her dog Pony . Pet foods and grooming kits are available at most supermarkets and dog training schools and 'dog hotels' have even sprung up in the country.

Dogs are considered 'unclean' but guard dogs are common and tolerated, although they are not usually allowed into homes. Specially trained dogs, such as those that detect drugs, or sheepdogs are also allowed. It has become increasingly fashionable in well-to-do Tehran neighbourhoods to keep dogs – especially expensive pedigrees – as status symbols.

Palace's co-chairman hoped to have a new manager installed by 'the early part of this week', to push at least three new signings through before the September 1 transfer deadline. Parish has only met Tim Sherwood and Malky Mackay so far in his bid to replace Pulis, who walked out on the eve of the season after rows over transfer policy. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Keith Millen: Can't discount players being effected . Difficult task: Steve Parish, pictured with Mark Bright,  is yet to find the right person to replace Tony Pulis . Off the shortlist: Tim Sherwood (left) and Malky Mackay (right) are both out the running to manage the Eagles . Palace decided not to appoint Mackay when the Scot became caught up in allegations of racism and homophobia brought by former club Cardiff, that also led to the resignation of the Eagles' sporting director Iain Moody. Former Tottenham boss Sherwood pulled out of the running after initially being deemed second choice. Caretaker manager Keith Millen will take control of Tuesday's Capital One Cup trip to Walsall, keen to solve defensive shortcomings that led to Saturday's 3-1 league defeat to West Ham. 'You read all sorts of things about how many people we've seen,' Parish told the Croydon Advertiser. 'I have seen very few people, probably two, but spoken to other people about managers and doing background work and due diligence. 'It's not a revolving door of people coming in and having a chat. We have got a profile of a manager we think needs to carry the club forward based on what I've experienced over the last four years. 'Finding the right person isn't easy. A lot of managers are in jobs and they're not going to leave clubs early in the season, so it's a difficult situation.' Caretaker boss: Keith Millen was placed in temporary charge of Crystal Palace following Pulis' shock exit . Not interested: Rangers boss Ally McCoist is not keen on taking up the reins at Selhurst Park . Rangers boss Ally McCoist distanced himself from the Selhurst Park role at the weekend, while Steve Clarke confirmed his interest but said no one from Palace had made contact. Former Norwich and Newcastle boss Chris Hughton and ex-Celtic manager Neil Lennon remain squarely in the frame. Temporary boss Millen conceded his biggest challenge now will be to piece together Palace's 'fragile' confidence at Walsall. 'We conceded twice from set-pieces and that's something we haven't done in the past, and something you can't afford to do in the Premier League,' said Millen. 'You put a brave face on it of course you do, I'm the one in charge at the moment. 'We've conceded two goals in three or four minutes, and that does knock the stuffing out of you, especially when you're a bit fragile.'","The south London club are yet to replace former manager Tony Pulis .

"Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity are being dropped by 40 radio stations in the ongoing wake of the Sandra Fluke controversy. The pair, whose radio shows are the first and second most popular in the US, are being taken off air by Cumulus Media which is the second-biggest broadcaster in the nation. The decision means that Limbaugh and Hannity will lose a significant chunk of their listeners - and could make NPR’s Morning Edition the most listened to radio show. However, Limbaugh is already making moves to get back on the radio in cities where he would be blacked out. Scroll down for video . Rush Limbaugh had advertisers leave in droves after he referred to a female law student as a 'slut' and a 'prostitute' for advocating free birth control . Conservative talk show host Sean Hannity, whose radio show is the second-most popular in the country, is also on the verge of being booted from thousands of local radio stations . The New York Daily News reports that in New York, Limbaugh - likely with Hannity along with him - is probably going to move from Cumulus' WABC station to WOR - an AM radio stationed owned by rival Clear Channel. The move is being hailed as a ‘major shakeup for the radio industry’ and even though it is reportedly over money, there is speculation that Limbaugh may be the real reason. The . root of the row does seem to be Limbaugh’s comments about Fluke, who in . February last year gave evidence before the House Democratic Steering . and Policy Committee on the need for affordable birth control. On . his radio show Limbaugh said in response that she ‘essentially says . that she must be paid to have sex - what does that make her?' He . went on: ‘It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She . wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford . the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to . have sex.’ His comments . sparked and firestorm on social media and an advertising boycott from . the likes of AOL, Sears, Netflix, Autozone, Capital One, J.C. Penney and . the Cleveland Cavaliers. Controversy: Sandra Fluke became a national celebrity when Limbaugh called her named after she was denied an appearance before a House hearing about birth control . Cumulus . chief executive Lew Dickey is said to have blamed him for the $2.4m . first quarter slump in advertising revenue after he called Fluke, the . pro-choice Georgetown University law student, a ‘slut’ and a . ‘prostitute’ live on air last spring. According to Politico, Cumulus has now said it will not renew either Limbaugh or Hannity’s contract, which expire at the end of the year. Negotiations . are also said to have broken down between Cumulus and Premiere . Networks, the division of Clear Channel which distributes the shows for . both men, because they could not agree on payments for distribution . rights. Both sides are reportedly tough negotiators and have apparently chosen to walk away rather than agree an unsatisfactory deal. Cumulus . has already begun working on how it will fill the slots vacated by . Limbaugh and Hannity and are looking at moving hosts like former . Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and conservative . commentator Mark Levin into one of their slots. Executives have also begun asking radio talent agencies and regional stations to put forward potential hosts. Jason Easley, a left-wing commentator with PoliticusUSA, said: ‘The boycotters did it. ‘They got Cumulus to dump not only Limbaugh, but also Hannity. NPR's Morning Edition could become the top radio show in the country if the two conservative talk shows are dropped from Cumulus Radio . ‘Without the public pressure, bad publicity, and shame that the boycott brought on to his advertisers, Rush Limbaugh and Cumulus would probably still have a happy marriage.’ Limbaugh and Hannity’s shows are the first and second most popular in the US with 14 million and 13.25 million listeners each week respectively. Being dropped by Cumulus does not mean they will be going off air completely as Clear Channel, the largest radio distributor in the US, will continue to carry them. But a surprising effect could be making publicly-funded National Public Radio's Morning Edition the no.1 show in the country. It is currently in third with 12.3 million listeners, followed by All Things Considered, also on NPR, with 11.8 million listeners. In a statement Cumulus said: ‘Cumulus is not in a position to comment about negotiations with talent under contract, no matter what the rumor of the day might be’.","Cumulus Media, the nation's second-largest owner of radio stations, is set to drop Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity .

"Today show hosts Matt Lauer and Al Roker have followed every move of Sochi's Olympians throughout their hard work - and today they decided to see what it was like to relax like them, too. In a hilarious segment that aired on Today on Wednesday, the duo took a trip to Russian baths where they were treated to steam baths and oil massages while wearing a series of fetching hats designed to protect their heads from the heat. As they walked to a collection of small . huts overlooking the Russian mountains, Lauer said: 'We've partied like . Olympians, we've had swagger like Olympians, now it's time to chill out . like Olympians.' But it wasn't all relaxing: they also endured a beating with eucalyptus leaves, which is supposed to improve circulation, release toxins and ward of illnesses. Scroll down for video . Ouch! Today show hosts Al Roker, left, and Matt Lauer, right, were beaten with eucalyptus leaves at a Russian baths on Wednesday. Lauer called the painful-looking experience 'recreational spanking' First, the men donned their felt hats and laid down on beds, where their backs were rubbed with oil. 'Do you have three hands?' Roker asked his masseur. 'It feels like there's more than two things going on right now.' The two men then grimaced as the leaves, which had been dipped in hot water, were whacked across their backs. 'That tingles!' Roker whispered. Lauer quipped: 'I'm not sure how much more of the recreational spanking I can take.' Bliss: Roker said he loved the experience at the baths and claimed it cured a sore shoulder . Sore: But Lauer said he was left with a rash that Roker said resembled tartare. The men were instructed to wear fetching felt hats, designed to protect their heads from the intense heat . Violent: The popular treatment is supposed to improve circulation, remove toxins and ward off illness . Sore, they then headed to a large steam bath where hot water was poured on their bodies and a bunch of leaves were placed on top of their heads. Lauer leaned back, saying, 'Now we can relax like Olympians.' 'By making Matt and Al soup,' Roker added. As the segment aired on Wednesday's show, the men said the Russian baths had been a great experience, while the crowd cheered for their hats. 'It was fun at the time,' Lauer said. 'But afterwards it left a bit of a mark on my back.' Hot work: The Today duo also 'relaxed' in a steaming bath which Roker called 'Matt and Al soup' Not convinced: Roker howled as hot water was poured over his head, while Lauer stayed camouflaged . But Roker, who said the treatment cured a sore shoulder, was more convinced. 'I loved it,' he said. 'My shoulder feels fantastic. But Matt has a rash on his back, it's pretty grim... I've seen tartare that looks better than that.' The pair are in Sochi for the Olympics along with fellow Today show hosts Savannah Guthrie, Jenna Bush Hager and Natalie Morales. Lauer has also been covering for NBC sportscaster Bob Costas while he battles an eye infection. Matt Lauer and Al Roker endured a beating with leaves, a popular and centuries-old treatment carried out at Russian baths. Temperatures inside the baths - knowns as a banya - can often reach more than 200F (93C) so felt hats are worn to protect the head from the heat. Then leaves from oak, white birch or eucalyptus trees are covered with hot water before they are smacked across the body repeatedly. The treatment is supposed to improve circulation while also removing dead skin and toxins. It is also believed that the massage - called a venik - releases phytoncides which stall pathogens. Different types of leaves are believed to help with different ailments. Birch, for example, is supposed to help wounds heal faster, while oak is believed to be good for blood pressure.","Today show hosts decided to relax like Olympians while working in Sochi .

"Steve Bruce and Hull City were supposed to be the history boys this season – they certainly didn’t expect their maiden European adventure to be consigned to the record books before August is out. But that is the sobering reality facing supporters who were still drunk on dreams of the San Siro and the like. They had waited 110 years for continental competition on Humberside but – after two ties and before the Europa League group stage had even begun – they are out, free again to concentrate on domestic matters. Is that, though, any consolation for Bruce? VIDEO Scroll down for Steve Bruce: We are disappointed but we have to move on . Dismissal: Hull's hopes of reaching group stage of Europa League were dashed by Yannick Sagbo's red card . Hull striker Sagbo was shown a red card for high challenge on Giorgis Galitsios . Hull (4-4-2): McGregor 5; Rosenior 5.5 (Jelavic 67, 6) Chester 6.5 (Ince 75, 5.5), Davies 6, Figueroa 6.5; Elmohamady 6, Meyler 5.5 (Huddlestone 75, 5), Livermore 6, Brady 7.5; Aluko 5, Sagbo 5.5 . Subs: Harper, Bruce, Maguire, Boyd . Lokeren (4-4-2): Verhulst 6; Galitsios 6, Maric 6.5, Scholz 6.5 Odoi 6; Remacle 7, Overmeire 6.5, Persoons 6, De Pauw 6; Vanaken 6.5, Dutra 6 . Subs: Boubacar, Mertens, Henrique, Leye, Kaya, Abdurahimi, Ngolok . Referee: Ovidiu Hategan (Rou) ‘We know how difficult it has been to do what we’ve done – play four European games already - but make no mistake, we wanted to be in the group stage,’ he said, later confirming that Uruguay striker Abel Hernandez is set to complete his £10million move from Palermo, pending a work-permit hearing. ‘We wanted the big European nights. It’s a shame we won’t have that. The experience has gone too quickly for everyone concerned – and that is the big disappointment.’ Hull – beaten 1-0 in Belgium last week – levelled the tie after just six minutes through Robbie Brady before Jordan Remacle smashed an equaliser after half-time. Brady, though, sparked hope with a conversion from the penalty spot only for Yannick Sagbo to get himself sent off following a risky lunge late on. It meant their premature exit was sealed on the away-goals rule. And Bruce reflected: ‘That’s European football – the frustration, the disappointment, the away-goals rule. Early strike: Robbie Brady scores from close range to give his side a dream start . ‘But we didn’t play to the level I expected. We gave the ball away cheaply. Four or five didn’t perform to the level we would expect. ‘To go out on away goals is the worst feeling – but that’s Europe. We didn’t get to grips with it well enough tonight.’ A fortnight earlier, in the return leg with Slovakian side AS Trencin, Hull had conceded early to set up a nerve-shredding night which only found relief 10 minutes from time when Sone Aluko scored the goal to send them through. Clincher: Lokeren's Jordan Remacle celebrates his crucial away goal . This time, however, home nerves were settled rather than frayed as Brady stole in at the far post to turn in Maynor Figueroa’s teasing centre. In hindsight, the breakthrough merely bred complacency and the Belgians bossed the remainder of the opening half. Last week’s match-winner Hans Vanaken was denied when his low blast was diverted wide by the desperate toe of Curtis Davies and, from the resulting corner, towering centre-back Mijat Maric somehow headed over from six yards. Butterfingers: Hull manager Steve Bruce fails to catch the ball . The visitors emerged the brighter after the break and, when Allan McGregor failed to fist clear of his area from a corner, Remacle snaffled possession before lashing through bodies and into the top corner on 48 minutes. Hull, though, came back at Lokeren and Brady had his second from the penalty spot seven minutes later. Ahmed Elmohamady crossed from the right, the ball catching the arm of Koen Persoons on what looked like the fringe of the area. Romanian referee Ovidiu Hategan and his assistant thought different, however, and Brady took advantage, Bruce unable to watch the Ireland winger tucking home. The award infuriated Lokeren boss Peter Maes – previously a picture of cool as he supped a beer during his post-match reflections last week – and he was sent to the stands. Clinical: Hull City's Robbie Brady scores second goal from the penalty spot . But it was opposite number Bruce incensed soon after when Sagbo was shown a straight red for a high challenge on Giorgis Galitsios. The 10 men were unable to recover. And Bruce said: ‘I think the sending off is very harsh. You wouldn’t be sent off for that in the Premier League. He doesn’t go over the ball at all, it’s a harsh decision. ‘But you can’t dwell on it. It’s disappointing for everyone concerned. It would have been terrific to get to the group stage. Upset: Penalty award infuriated Lokeren manager Peter Maes and he was sent to the stands . ‘The players are a resilient mob and they will come back in and dust themselves down. They will get over it.’ Dreams of trips to Inter Milan now await Maes and Lokeren in today’s group-stage draw, and he said: ‘I think we deserved it. What we did on the pitch was very good. ‘Their goal was an individual mistake but we recovered from that and played more aggressive. We played with a lot of confidence and we’re delighted to be through.’","Robbie Brady put Hull ahead after just six minutes .

"One of Princess Diana's oldest friends has spoken of her joy at becoming Prince George's godmother. Julia Samuel told MailOnline that she was delighted at the honour and saw her role as an 'important responsibility'. The inclusion of Mrs Samuel, 54, in yesterday's list of seven godparents was a poignant acknowledgement of William’s late mother. She met and became friends with Diana in 1987 when the two were seated next to each other at a dinner and, according to Mrs Samuel, 'saw something in each other'. Scroll down for video . Honoured: Julia Samuel, pictured with her husband Michael, left, and fellow godparent Hugh Grosvenor, son of the Duke of Westminster, right, spoke of her pride today at being made godmother to Prince George . Smiling and happy: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge grinned at their family as they held their young prince at the big event yesterday . Nod to the past: Julia Samuel, left, one of Diana Princess of Wales' closest friends has been handed the honour by the Cambridges . Although the princess fell out with many of her friends, Mrs Samuel remained loyal. William is now royal patron of the charity Child Bereavement UK, of which she is founder patron and trustee. The charity does remarkable work in supporting families and professionals when a child dies or when a child suffers a bereavement themselves. In her statement The Hon Mrs Michael Samuel - as she was referred to by Kensington Palace yesterday - said: 'I am delighted to have been invited to become godmother to His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. 'It is both a joyful and an important responsibility which I am incredibly proud to accept.' Happy occasion: The proud parents are walked from the chapel by Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury who had just baptised George . Delight: The Duke of Cambridge holds his son . Prince George (left), while the baby is held by Kate (right) who stands . next to the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres . Quiet: Prince George appeared contented as he was held by his mother on only his second public appearance since he was carried from the Lindo Wing in July . Many will have been hoping for a recognition of Diana on such an historic day and Mrs Samuel's presence was just that. Diana was also very much present not just in the engagement band that glints on the Duchess’s finger but in the very choice of the Chapel Royal itself, where her body lay before the altar so her family and friends could pay their respects in private, before her formal funeral in Westminster Abbey in 1997. That link was also one of the reasons that Kate chose the chapel to be formally confirmed into the Church of England before her marriage to Prince William in April 2011. Mrs Samuel is herself  a bereavement counsellor in the NHS paediatrics department of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington,  where Prince George was born. Softly-spoken and a good listener, Julia, has her own private practice, and has 'been a source of strength for William'. Born Julia Guinness and part of the famous brewing dynasty, one of her sisters — Sabrina — went out with Prince Charles. She married the Hon Michael Samuel, of the Hill Samuel banking family, and had the first of her four children at just 21. After the excitement of yesterday's . family christening at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, the Duke . and Duchess of Cambridge were this morning sitting down with aides as . they poured over the formal family photographs taken after the ceremony . at neighbouring Clarence House by celebrity photographer Jason Bell. Three . will be released to the media later today including one historic shot . that will, for the first time in more than a century, feature a monarch . and three living heirs: the Queen, Prince Charles, 64, Prince William, . 31 and George. The last . occasion such picture was taken was in 1894 when Queen Victoria was . photographed with her son Edward VII, grandson George V and great . grandson Edward VIII. Brother: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge asked their siblings to do the readings during the 45-minute ceremony, with Harry reading John (15: 1-5), which begins 'I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener' LIZ JONES FASHION VERDICT: Perfection: the Queen wore a sky blue cashmere coat with mother of pearl buttons over a paisley dress by Scottish couturier Stewart Parvin, with a (warm!) cashmere hat made by her redoubtable dresser, Angela Kelly. The brooch is a ruby and diamond basket of flowers given to her by King George to mark the birth of Prince Charles in 1948 . Siblings: Pippa and James Middleton walk out of the chapel with the small congregation, including their smiling mother Carole yesterday afternoon . In an historic ceremony which brought . together four generations of the Royal Family, the three-month-old . future king was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the Chapel . Royal at St James’s Palace yesterday. Dressed . in a handmade replica of Queen Victoria’s daughter’s christening robe, . George bore a striking resemblance to his father at a similar age. He was on his best behaviour. With the . eyes of the world on him, His Royal Highness Prince George Alexander . Louis of Cambridge put on a perfect display of royal etiquette. According to aides, there wasn’t ‘even . a peep’ out of the three-month-old future king as he was baptised by . the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, at the Chapel . Royal in St James’s Palace. ‘He went in smiling, came out smiling and, as far as we are aware, smiled throughout,’ said one. William, however, could not resist confiding: ‘It’s the first time he’s been quiet all day.’ The . Archbishop of Canterbury told the congregation in the Holbein-painted . chapel that George’s parents and godparents had a ‘simple task’ – to . ‘make sure he knows who this Jesus is’. Joyous: Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cornwall followed by the Prince of Wales (background) leave the Chapel Royal holding programmes from the event . Colourful: The St James's Palace detachment of The Queen's Guard turns out in Colour Court, St James Palace, for the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II, ahead of the christening . Still smiling: Kate's sister Pippa Middleton leaves Kensington Palace after the christening of Prince George at the Chapel Royal in St James' Palace . The simplicity of the half-hour ceremony contrasted with the historic grandeur of the surroundings. The . heart of Mary I is buried beneath the choir-stalls and Elizabeth I . prayed there for the defence of the realm against the Spanish armada in . 1588. George’s life too, is . already steeped in history. The Archbishop made the sign of the cross on . his head with water taken from the River Jordan, in a royal tradition . that dates back to the 12th century. The . water was poured into the silver Lily Baptismal Font which was . commissioned by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1840 and has been . used at every royal christening since. His . parents’ guest list for the christening – which left out senior members . of the family including Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne – . was a surprise to some. It did, however, result in the ‘intimacy’ the . Duke and Duchess of Cambridge craved. Indeed, . there were just 23 guests present, giving the christening a feel of a . family gathering rather than the moment a future Supreme Governor was . presented to his Church. For . the Queen it was very much business as usual. She broke away from her . schedule for only an hour – and was last night busy hosting a charity . reception at the Palace.

"It was a brutal murder case of an elderly Utah woman that had sat cold for 23 years. But now police say they the mysterious death of 78-year-old Lucille Johnson in 1991 - who was found bludgeoned and strangled in her Salt Lake City home - has been solved, all because of some pieces of Lego. The toy building blocks were found in the entry way of the house in Holladay and stored away as part of an evidence file following the crime, which Mrs Johnson's family believed they would never get the answers to, according to Fox 13. That file was reopened last year, with DNA testing discovering residue that linked them to the alleged killer - John Sansing, 47, a convicted murderer currently on death row in Arizona for an unrelated case. Cold case solved: John Sansing, 47 (left), who is already on death row for another murder, has now been charged with killing Lucille Johnson, 78 (right), in 1991, after a Lego building block linked him to the crime . Vital: Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder shows the Lego pieces that allowed investigators to crack the cold case during a news conference on Thursday . DNA: Investigators were able to find fingerprints on the Lego from Sansing's then-five-year-old son, who they believe was in Johnson's house playing with the toys at the time of the murder 23 years ago . Scene: Lucille Johnson was killed at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Avondale on February 2, 1991 . Fingerprints on the Lego were matched to Sansing's juvenile son, who they now believe was playing in the house when his father allegedly murdered Mrs Johnson. Detectives also submitted scrapings from . under Johnson’s fingernails to scan for DNA, with investigators matching . the DNA profile to Sansing. At the time of the killing, police believed the person responsible had been invited into the home by Mrs Johnson. Investigators say Sansing and Mrs Johnson did not know each other. No motive for the killing has been released, however jewelry was missing from the house. It's possible Sansing used his son to gain entry to the house. Sansing, who has been charged with capital murder in Utah for Mrs Johnson's death, is now being looked at for other unsolved murders in the state between 1989 and 1991. 'Occasionally we encounter people who are evil,' Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder said at a news conference Thursday. 'The individual who perpetrated this is nothing short of that.' 'When you hear the details of this particular case, you will see that this individual is barely human. 'While in that home, it is clear Mr. Sansing bludgeoned Lucille to death, leaving his five-year-old apparently in the living room to play with Legos. 'On those Legos were the fingerprints of Mr. Sansing’s juvenile son.' The break in the case after all these years have lifted a great weight for Mrs Johnson's family. 'It was very important that it be solved,' Jerry Johnson, Lucille Johnson's son, told ABC News. 'I wasn't sure it would ever be solved.' 'I am so grateful, so very grateful to the police department for the work that they’ve done,' Johnson's daughter, Shirley England, told ABC News. 'I don’t think closure is the right word because you never close something like this. 'It’s been a terrible thing in our life.' Grateful: Lucille Johnson's children, Shirley England and Jerry Johnson, said their mother's unsolved murder has been 'a terrible thing in our life' Two years after Johnson died, Sansing pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated assault, a class A misdemeanor, in a separate case, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. He then moved to Arizona in 1995. On February 24, 1998, Sansing, a married father of four, called the Living Springs Assembly of God Church in Avondale, Arizona, and requested a food box be delivered to his house. When the church worker, Elizabeth 'Trudy' Calabrese, 41, arrived, Sansing tied her up with electrical cords and hit her on the head with a broom, according to Supreme Court of Arizona records. Police said at the time Sansing's children witnessed him and his wife, Kara Kay Sansing, 28, tie up Calabrese. Sansang then went and dumped her car before returning to his home and sexually assaulting Calabrese. He then stabbed the victim to death, court records show. Murderer: John Sansing waits in Phoenix, Arizona, on Thursday, September 30, 1999, to be sentenced after pleading guilty for first degree murder in the death of Elizabeth 'Trudy' Calabrese in February 1998. Sansing was sentenced to death for the torture, raping and stabbing of the church volunteer who was delivering free food to his family . Sansing left Calabrese's body in the bedroom while he and his wife - who was home the entire time - slept in the living room. Sansing woke in the middle of the night and hid the victim's body under some clothes in his backyard, between a shed and a wall, while his children slept. All four children saw the dead body, police said at the time. Sansing's wife, who told police she had witnessed the stabbing murder, was charged separately. A jury found Sansing guilty of first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and sexual assault, and he was sentenced to death . It is not known whether he will be extradited to Utah to face the new murder charges.","Lucille Johnson, 78, was strangled and beaten to death in her Salt Lake City home in February 1991 .

"Many motorists dream of the day they can sit back and relax while their car drives itself. And while Google and other companies are working hard to make autonomous vehicles a reality, it could take years to create a car that can negotiate complex situations on the road – including wet weather conditions. Google’s self-driving cars can’t currently cope in heavy rain or snow – or find their way around 99 per cent of the US, an insider has admitted. A bump in the road? A Google Insider has admitted that the firm's cars (pictured) are incredibly reliant on maps, can't cope with wet weather conditions and are unable to 'see' potholes. All these safety concerns will have to be addressed before the technology becomes mainstream, but experts think it is only a matter of years . According to MIT Technology Review, the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and can’t react like a human driver, dodging potholes and other hazards. Google’s cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles (1,126,540km) but they can’t cope in snowy conditions and cannot negotiate heavy rain. Chris Urmson, director of the Google car team, said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions. While the cars’ cameras can spot a traffic light changing, they can be confused by strong sunlight. Google tests its cars virually (pictured) as well as on real roads. Google’s cars have driven themselves over 700,000 miles (1,126,540km) - but there is still a long way to go to hone the technology . In the US, driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as this month. Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot. It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. They don’t distinguish between an empty plastic bag - which could be easily driven over - or a rock, so cars must drive around both. They also can’t detect uncovered manholes or potholes. Mr Urmson told the publication: ‘I could construct a construction zone that could befuddle the car.’ The cars ‘see’ pedestrians as moving blocks of pixels and know to stop, but unlike a cautious human driver, they could not spot a traffic policeman at the side of the road, waving for traffic to stop - which could lead to trouble. Despite the cars being allowed on public roads, they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver, because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go – and a car cannot deviate from its route. An area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways, in order to make the cars' routes. These details then need to be pored over metre-by metre by humans and computers, in a much more labour-intensive process than in needed to maker Google Maps. Despite best efforts, routes can lack details such as temporary traffic lights that have been installed, or if there are road works or potholes to avoid, which the car might drive over. In addition, maps have only been made for a few thousand miles of road, so in order for the cars to roam the US, Google would need to pour a vast amount of resources into mapping the rest of the vast country, down to the tiniest changing detail. The company is working on ironing out all these problems. For example, if a Google car notes new lights and street signs, it sends a message to update the mapping software. Google unveiled a compact version of its car without a steering wheel, but it will now have to re-introduce the wheel to comply with the California Department of Motor Vehicles’ new regulations. Despite all these set-backs, Mr Urmson said autonomous cars will ‘happen more quickly than people think’ – perhaps as soon as in five years’ time. Google said its current cars can't drive in snow (stock image) and heavy rain. Experts say this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions . The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and react to other vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read in real time what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100 miles (160 km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40 km/h) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service. Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.","Google's autonomous cars can't navigate 99% of the US, an insider said .

"A jury took less than an hour to find a woman guilty on Tuesday in the 2011 starvation death of her ten-year-old stepson. The Dallas County jury found Elizabeth Ramsey, 33, guilty of intentional serious injury to a child in Johnathan Ramsey's death. The child weighed just 60lb when he died and in desperation, had eaten his own feces. Jurors will hear testimony today in the sentencing phase of Ramsey's trial and could sentence her to a maximum of life imprisonment. Elizabeth Ramsey, 33, was found guilty of starving to death her ten-year-old stepson in Texas and faces life in prison . The boy's 35-year-old father, Aaron Ramsey, is serving a life sentence already. Prosecutors said the two locked the boy in his room at the family's Dallas, Texas home, then slowly starved him on a diet of bread and water or milk and dumped his emaciated body in a rural area south of Dallas in 2011. The body was found the next year in a creek. The stepmother's attorneys asserted that her husband kept her from reporting her stepson's ordeal. Ramsey's lawyers had asked jurors to find her guilty of a lesser charge, arguing that Aaron Ramsey was the instigator and she was forced to participate in the crime. Prosecutors blamed the couple equally for Johnathan’s death. Witnesses described Elizabeth Ramsey as a habitual liar with a hot temper. Johnathan Ramsey was starved for months by his stepmother and father until his tiny body gave out in 2011. The pair then dumped the child in a rural area, south of Dallas . Johnathan's grandfather, Edward Ramsey, . had contacted police early in 2012 to ask them to search for the child . because he had not seen the boy for more than a year. The boy's 35-year-old father, Aaron Ramsey, is serving a life sentence already . The boy's biological mother, Judy Williams, and other relatives did not see him for months. Williams lives in New Mexico and has custody of the couple's other son, according to relatives. Police said Aaron and Elizabeth Ramsey, the child's stepmother, initially claimed the boy had gone to live with his mother but later confessed to starving the boy to death. According to police, Aaron Ramsey said he put his son on 'military rations' because the boy began to misbehave early last year. Ramsey said the boy had punched his stepmother in the stomach when she was pregnant, causing a miscarriage. Johnathan’s schoolteacher Carrie Liska said that the child was never violent but quiet and sweet. She . told the Dallas News that Johnathan didn't play much with other . children which could be attributed to his Asperger syndrome. Ramsey said he hit Johnathan in the chest and then locked him in a bedroom, according to the records. Jurors in Elizabeth Ramsey's trial heard testimony that Ramsey was not pregnant after all. Relatives told Dallas News on Monday that Elizabeth Ramsey was known for making up lies, at one point claiming to be an FBI agent and earning her doctorate at college. Elizabeth Ramsey grew up believing that her mother was her sister after she was adopted by her maternal grandparents as a baby. Her biological mother Kathleen Pate, who blew kisses to Ramsey from the stand, told the court on Monday that her daughter lied frequently and had a very short temper, according to the Dallas News. Johnathan was found lying on the bedroom floor in August, according to court records. Aaron Ramsey told detectives he changed his son into his favorite T-shirt, placed him into a sleeping bag and inserted a dryer sheet to mask the smell of his body, the records said.","Elizabeth Ramsey, 33, found guilty of intentional serious injury to a child in Johnathan Ramsey's death .

"Hundreds of victims of the civil war in Syria will be able to come to Britain as refugees in the coming months, ministers confirmed yesterday. The offer will be targeted at the most vulnerable people including orphaned children, women and girls at risk of sexual violence, survivors of torture and those with disabilities. Home Secretary Theresa May announced the resettlement scheme yesterday and Britain could be ‘proud’ of its support for Syrians facing ‘appalling violence and suffering.’ Home Secretary Theresa May announced the resettlement scheme yesterday and Britain could be 'proud' of its support for Syrians facing 'appalling violence and suffering' The deal was struck after weeks of talks with the Liberal Democrats about how to respond to the Syrian conflict which has raged for almost three years. Nick Clegg said Britain had a ‘moral responsibility’ to help alleviate suffering in the region where more than 100,000 people have died and millions displaced from their homes. Last week immigration minister Mark Harper claimed that resettling a small number of refugees was ‘token’ given the scale of the crisis, but yesterday Mrs May confirmed the government’s change of heart. She said there was no specific target for the number who would be admitted but expected it to be several hundred. The United Nations will help identify the most traumatic cases. Poverty: A Syrian woman lies in an empty . building in the Kucukpazar district of Istanbul yesterday. Destitute . refugees are filling houses in the Turkish capital which have been . evacuated for urban development projects . Misery: A Syrian refugee carries his son along the market street at Zaatari refugee camp, near the Syrian . border in Mafraq, Jordan. Millions of Syrians have been displaced . by the three-year civil war in their country . Mrs May said: ‘Some of the worst abuses in the Syrian conflict involve the use of sexual violence including in regime detention centres. We will be providing emergency sanctuary to people who are most at risk including victims of torture and violence’. The deal was welcomed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees which has called on countries outside the region to take in 30,000 Syrians in the greatest need. So far Western countries have agreed to take 18,000, of which Germany has agreed to take 10,000, France to take 500 and the United States has put no cap on the number they will take. In response to pressure from Labour, the home secretary said Britain had already made a major contribution as the second largest aid donor to the region having given £600million. More Syrians in Istanbul: It is estimated that . more than 11.5million people inside Syria and those who have fled to . neighbouring countries are in urgent need of food, shelter and medical . treatment . Around 1,100 Syrians have already come to Britain as refugees last year under a different programme. Mrs May added: ‘The greatest need is in the region and it is there that the United Kingdom can make the largest impact’. Britain is providing food, shelter and medical aid to hundreds of thousands of people in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon. Several MPs speaking in the parliamentary debate on Britain’s response to the conflict yesterday compared it to the Kindertransport scheme rescuing children from Nazi Germany in the months before the war broke out. But Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen accused David Cameron of ‘political posturing’. He said Britain had donated more in aid than the rest of the EU put together and that admitting a few hundred people would make little difference to such a vast refugee crisis. ‘I think that people can see the political expediency of the u-turn’, he told the BBC.","Hundreds of victims of civil war in Syria will be able to come to Britain .

"The US government has been able to secretly spy on its citizens through their computer’s webcams for several years, it has been revealed. The FBI has long been able to activate a computer’s camera without triggering the ‘recording light’ to let the owner know the webcam is on, a former assistant director of its tech division has said. Their usage of remote administration tools (RATs) comes to light as the world's most powerful technology firms call on Barack Obama to curb government spying on internet users. Eye spy: The FBI can activate a computer¿s camera without letting the owner know it is recording, a former employee has revealed . The FBI have been able to use the spyware technology for years and have put it in place in terrorism cases or the most serious criminal investigations, Marcus Thomas, former assistant director of the FBI’s Operational Technology Division in Quantico, told the Washington Post. Although the FBI reportedly uses 'ratting' sparingly, they have been rejected remotely activating video feeds on at least one occasion, in Houston, Texas, in December last year. The FBI were investigating a suspect in a bank fraud case, but the presiding judge ruled that the risk of accidentally obtaining information of innocent people was too great. Hacking into webcams using remote administration tools, also known as ‘ratting’, to spy on women and ‘enslave’ them by controlling their computers and secretly filming and taking pictures is not a new phenomenon but has grown in the past year. Here's looking at you, kid: The malware is activated by emailing a link which tricks the computer user to download a spying software onto their machine . Earlier this year, tech site Arstechnica revealed that one of the 'slave forums' had 23 million total posts, where ‘ratters’ boasted about their ‘slaves’ posting pictures, mainly of women, unaware that they were being watched. The FBI team use the same technique as ratters, by infecting the computer with a malicious software – ‘malware – through phishing. By sending an email with a link, which could be to a website, an image or a video, the user is tricked into downloading a small piece of software onto their machine. Reveal: NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, revealed top secret US surveillance programmes to alert the public of what is being done in their name . Once installed, the malware allows the FBI to take control of the computer and the webcam at any time, working similarly to the system large corporations use to update software and fix IT problems. ‘We have transitioned into a world where law enforcement is hacking into people’s computers, and we have never had public debate,’ Christopher Soghoian, principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union told the Post. ‘Judges are having to make up these powers as they go along.’ Earlier today, CEO’s of Apple, Facebook, Google, AOL, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo united to call on the US government to cease online spying on its citizens. The open letter to the President and Congress reads: 'We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens. But this summer's revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide. 'The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual - rights that are enshrined in our Constitution. This undermines the freedoms we all cherish. It's time for change. The rare show of unity by usually fierce competitors is seen as a reflection of the damage in public confidence inflicted by leaks from Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower. Earlier this year he revealed how U.S. and British spy agencies were able to harvest huge amounts of data - including emails and search history - on millions of people by tapping into internet servers.","FBI has had secret webcam spying technology 'for several years'

"From Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year to Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year, a tongue-in-cheek list of GQ Awards’ winners has been unveiled. The mocked-up winners’ list, which was posted on Twitter today, appears to have been prompted by Tony Blair’s surprise Philanthropist of the Year award. The former Prime Minister picked up the gong for his efforts in ‘establishing three charities’ at the central London awards ceremony – much to the surprise of the star-studded audience which was said to be ‘muted’ as his name was read out. Scroll down for video . The mocked-up GQ awards winners' list - a digitally altered version of the leading magazine’s actual list - shows nine unlikely winners of some of its biggest awards and has been circulated heavily on social media . Twitter users were less-than-impressed with Tony Blair being awarded Philanthropist of the Year by GQ . The GQ Men of the Year awards are a popular fixture among celebrities with many A-listers attending the event last night, including Kate Middleton’s sister Pippa, model Cara Delevingne and Kim Kardashian West. However, while the likes of Ringo Starr, Colin Firth, Pharrell Williams and Iggy Pop actually picked up awards – the dummy winners’ list which emerged today appears to mock Mr Blair’s charity award. On receiving his honour at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, the 61-year-old, said: ‘I would like to dedicate this award to the people that work with and for my organisations. I feel the pulse of progress beating a little harder.' He and his wife Cherie have a property empire worth an estimated £30million, having bought homes for their children, and since stepping down from office in 2007 he has established three charities - The Tony Blair Sports Foundation, Faith Foundation and the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative. However, his recognition didn’t go down well across the country, with thousands taking to social media to question the award. Labour MP John Mann said ‘it sends the wrong message’, adding: ‘This sort of award should go to an unsung hero who has given up their time for charity.’ Former Prime Minister Tony Blair picked up Philanthropist of the Year award at last night's GQ Men of the Year awards ceremony for his work in establishing three charities - much to the shock of the star-studded audience . Mr Blair's award was met with a wave of criticism on social media including this response from Gary Lineker . Others expressed their shock and questioned why the charity award was given to the former Prime Minister . Dozens of people referenced Mr Blair's award on Twitter overnight, with many surprised at his recognition . And even Gary Lineker said: ‘Apparently, Tony Blair has won GQ’s philanthropist of the year award. Finally these awards have grasped irony!’ The shock award, dubbed a PR stunt by many, appears to be the reason for the mocked-up winners' list which was posted on Twitter by @JamieDMJ this morning. The photo - a digitally altered version of the leading magazine’s actual winners’ list - shows nine unlikely winners of some of GQ’s biggest awards. The Skeletor is hailed Man of the Year, Scrooge McDuck as Philanthropist of the Year, The Queen Alien as Woman of the Year and Paul Ross as TV Personality of the Year. Another image circulating on social media (above) shows Mr Blair with his GQ award but has been digitally altered so the words 'The Irony' appear on the photo. One Twitter user described it as the 'joke of the year' The mocked-up tongue-in-cheek GQ winners' list, posted on Twitter today, names Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) as International Man of the Year and North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un (right) as Humanitarian of the Year . It also awards Solo Artist of the Year to disgraced Rolf Harris, Legend of the Year to fictional character Cthulhu and Ivan Drago as Sports Personality of the Year. However, two of the most alarming ‘winners’ are Russian President Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year and North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year. The mocked-up list has already been shared dozens of times on Twitter, with one user – called Andy – jokingly adding: ‘That’s gonna put some pressure of the Nobel prize list.’ The GQ Men of the Year awards ceremony is an annual event with gongs being dished out to high profile figures who have contributed in some way to society. Last year, Sir Bobby Charlton, Piers Morgan and boxing champion Carl Froch picked up awards.

Aleshin, who drives for Sam Schmidt, spun when he went below the white line in the turn. He slid back up the track and collided with Charlie Kimball in a shower of sparks and smoke, sending Aleshin’s car flying into the catch fence while spinning. Kimball improbably escaped serious injury, walking away from his wrecked car. Debris was strewn all over the track as safety personnel gathered around the wreck of Aleshin, who was removed on a stretcher.

The 27-year-old driver also had several run-ins with Sebastien Bourdais earlier in the season, and he was involved in an unusual crash with Juan Pablo Montoya in Toronto. Montoya was stalled in a tire barrier when Aleshin spun into the back of his car. Aleshin then slid under Montoya, leaving tire marks on Aleshin’s helmet and requiring a tow truck to lift Montoya’s car off Aleshin. In July, Aleshin hurt his left wrist after crashing with Takuma Sato of Japan at the Iowa Speedway in Newton, Iowa, during the Verizon IndyCar Series.

"A ringing endorsement from Sami Hyypia is one you cherish. That’s exactly what Joao Teixeira has enjoyed after the Liverpool youngster’s loan spell at Brighton has begun with the sort of promise that will have those around Melwood with more than a little interest. Hyypia spoke of Albion having a ‘very good player’ on their hands and the need to ‘get the ball to him in dangerous areas’. Clearly the Championship side see the Portuguese as their catalyst – even after just three games together.

Liverpool bought him for £800,000 after he had starred for Sporting Lisbon during their 3-0 victory at Anfield in the 2011 NextGen Series. Teixeira is a player with the sort of poise and guile in possession Rodgers yearns for – an attacking midfielder with the ability to pick holes in defences, find the net and lay on for others. What he does need is regular game time in order to hone his skills; Hyypia spotted this, got on the phone to former team-mate Steven Gerrard and the player agreed to head south for the season. it was slightly surprising that he'd make the jump to the Championship, given he was unable to break into Brentford's League One promotion team last season. But he's grabbed the opportunity already. It's good to talk! Brighton boss Sami Hyypia spoke to Steven Gerrard before sanctioning the loan move . Liverpool have invested a significant amount of time and money into nurturing Teixeira. The signs are that he could become someone with a huge amount to offer in the coming years. The Reds have always known this. Former academy director Frank McParland sanctioned the original spend from Sporting Lisbon in 2012. 'We knew when we saw him he was one for us and when we got the chance to sign him the manager backed me and we spent a considerable sum for him,' McParland told Sportsmail at the time. ‘He is going to be a top, top player.' Think Philippe Coutinho. Supporters wouldn’t mind another one of him.","Liverpool signed the Portuguese for £800,000 from Sporting Lisbon .

"The world’s fastest mobility scooter has smashed the current record with a top speed of almost 108mph at a race in the UK. David Anderson and Matthew Hine from Anderson’s Body Shop in Ballasalla on the Isle of Man custom built the vehicle in an attempt to break the top speed of 82mph. Mr Hine was strapped into the seat as he raced around the track at the Pokerstars Drag and Drift at Jurby Motordrome on the island on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Matthew Hine pictured riding the world's fastest mobility scooter at 108mph at Jurby Motordrome on Saturday . In testing the pair had managed to reach a maximum speed of 107.3mph and were aiming for at least 108mph in the race – they said on Facebook ‘anything less would be a fail’. Mr Hine, who built the scooter from scratch with his colleague, said: ‘It’s a 600 Bandit, slightly modified, split exhausts, tweaked carburetors shoehorned into a mobility scooter. ‘The frame was a cart chassis, shortened and lengthened to fit into the scale of a mobility scooter.’ Mr Anderson, who carried out the body work, said: ‘The body work is all aluminium and everything works on it as well such as the lights, indicators, brake lights – even the horn works.’ The scooter was custom built by David Anderson (left) and Matthew Hine (right) of Anderson's Body Shop .

At the start line, Mr Hine took it for three  test runs before reaching 108mph - a speed they were happy with . The pair said on their Facebook that anything less than 108mph for them would have been 'a fail' The moments they reached the record-breaking speed were captured on a camera strapped to driver Mr Hine .

Bonus: Accessed by a secret Prohibition-era door, the home comes with its own English-style pub . Rancher and property investor Charles H. Jackson, Jr. and his wife, Ann, bought the land in the late 1920s and built the main house, which has since been expanded to a 30,000 square-foot mansion, according to The Wall Street Journal. The Jackson family took over the estate following the death of the couple, with the house not being used as a full-time residence since 1990. The family, now spread all over the country, have finally decided to sell, with the mammoth grounds becoming too difficult to maintain. The Alta California-style house is built around a courtyard and has 12 bedrooms and 10 full and three half bathrooms. The pub is located by a hidden door on the bottom level. Some 10 separate cottages - which were typically used to house staff and guests - dot the land, which features about 100 acres of citrus and avocado orchards. The Jackson's bred polo and race horses as well as dogs on the property, so there is a barn and stable, outdoor paddocks, a 11,250-square-foot covered riding arena and an outdoor training track, according to The Wall Street Journal. There is also a secret tower office that can only be accessed by an exterior set of stairs attached to the master bedroom. 'It's almost like a small city,' Mr. Kolb told The Journal.

"Parents want to believe their babies are capable far more than their young age would suggest, but a company that claimed it would teach infants to read is being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars. For years, consumers were peppered with infomercials and internet ads claiming that parents and caregivers could give their youngsters 'Your Baby Can Read' products. The company claimed the program was essentially 'supercharging' their brains in order for them to learn more whilst becoming confident and proficient readers. A load of nonsense: Your Baby Can Read, created by Dr. Robert Titzer, raked in more than $185 million from the sales of its $200 kits . It was even suggested that toddlers would be reading Harry potter novels by the ages of three or four. However, the federal government has decided it was all a load of nonsense. In a settlement announced Friday by the Federal Trade Commission, the founder of 'Your Baby Can Read,' Dr. Robert Titzer, along with his company, Infant Learning, agreed to judgments of more than $185 million to resolve charges filed by the agency alleging the program had no scientific evidence to make the claims. Outside research, however, shows it's unlikely kids will be able to read by the time they start preschool. What's more, a recent study out of New York University finds that babies don't develop any reading skills when they're exposed to reading-readiness products like DVDs, flash cards and flipbooks. Read after me: The program made claims in ads, infomercials, and on social media that it could teach babies to read as early as nine months out of the womb . Most children learn to read on their own by the time they're 7 years old, although some learn a bit earlier. The company claimed that through the 'Your Baby Can Read' flash cards, lift-a-flap books and videos that as early children as young as nine-months-old could start to read. The program cost about $200. The FTC settled on that figure because $185 million was amounted to Infant Learning's gross sales from Baby Can Read. The company that marketed the program went out of business in 2012 when the agency first took action against it. No proof: The FTC said the makers of YBCR lacked competent and reliable scientific evidence showing the program could teach babies to read, or that the program helped very young children of a preschool age . However, the FTC said it was still selling copies of the program online after that time. 'Marketers and expert endorsers must have adequate substantiation for the claims they make, and the FTC will continue to pursue those who fail to abide by this basic rule,' FTC Consumer Protection Director Jessica Rich said in a statement. Parents have are advised that simply because the FTC has debunked the marketing claims of 'Your Baby Can Read' doesn't mean you should stop reading to your baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement this year for all parents to crack a book open with their little ones early and often, since research has shown children who are read to during the infant, toddler and preschool years have better language skills when school starts.","The company’s massive ad campaign featured 14-month-olds mastering vocabulary flashcards and two-year-olds reading books .

"Michael Sam is no longer attached to an NFL team and none of them appear to want to pick him up because his sexual orientation causes too much distraction, claims a Buffalo Bills star. Offensive lineman Eric Wood goes on, more specifically, to blame the media for focusing on the personal life of the NFL's first openly gay draft pick. 'Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted in response to Sam's inability to find an NFL home. 'No one wants the distraction.' Wood's comment came after sports . commentator Ross Tucker publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam . performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a . practice squad?' Blames the media: Buffalo Bills offensive lineman Eric Wood (right) believes ESPN and not the inherent bigotries of the NFL is to blame for Michael Sam (left) losing out on playing this season . Why wasn't he picked up? Wood tweeted his opinion on the Michael Sam saga in response to football commentator Ross Tucker's public questioning of the gay athlete's misfortune . The comments also hark back to ESPN's report on Sam's locker room habits earlier this month and their subsequent apology. Instead . of focusing on the St. Louis Rams' first round of cuts, reporter Josina . Anderson chose to feature Sam's shower etiquette. 'Another . Rams defensive player told me that “Sam is respecting our space” and . that, from his perspective, he seems to think that Michael Sam is kind . of waiting to take a shower, as not to make his teammates feel . uncomfortable,' Anderson said. The reporter said she also asked other players about Sam's showering schedule. After . public outcry, ESPN spokesman Josh Krulewitz wrote in a statement that . the network 'regrets the manner in which we presented our report.' 'Clearly, . yesterday we collectively failed to meet the standards we have set in . reporting on LGBT-related topics in sports,' he added. 'Sam is respecting our space': Reporter Josina Anderson delivered the report that forced ESPN to apologize for focusing on the showering habits of Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay athlete . While . getting cut by the St. Louis Rams means Sam's dreams of becoming the . first gay NFL player have now been placed on hold, he was undeterred. He posted a message of positivity to his Twitter account over the weekend despite his obstacles. 'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues,' he wrote. His . boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a . picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of . Missouri, where they both attended college. Sam showed up for his face-to-face exit meeting with St. Louis Rams coach Jeff Fisher, a few hours after clearing waivers. Sam . arrived at Rams Park via through the media entrance Sunday afternoon . still looking right at home clad in T-shirt, shorts and flip flips. He . shook hands with two reporters and accepted well wishes but declined . further comment before heading upstairs to see the coach who wasn't . afraid to add the first openly gay player to the roster. All 21 players released Saturday cleared waivers. Sam's future was a major topic on Twitter, some of it vitriol, some reasoned. The Rams appeared unlikely to re-sign Sam to the 10-player practice squad because the defensive line is their strongest unit and they need help elsewhere. Support: Vito Cammisano uploaded this picture of boyfriend, Michael Sam, on Saturday, after the NFL player was cut by the Rams during pre-season . Upbeat: Despite his obstacles, Sam tweeted a message of optimism over the weekend as ever NFL team overlooked him despite a surprisingly strong pre-season performance . The meeting with Sam meeting was postponed a day so he could attend Missouri's opening victory over South Dakota State. The 7th-round draft pick has been outspoken and confident as his progress was watched as closely as any rookie in the league. He has been cheered by athletes and celebrities. In the end, the defensive end couldn't make a team stocked with pass-rushers. The news was first reported by ESPN. Sam still has a chance to get picked up by another team or to make the Rams' practice squad. On Saturday, he attended Missouri's opener in Columbia, a 1 1/2-hour drive west on I-70 from Rams Park. He was introduced to the crowd at the cut down deadline in the end zone alongside defensive E.J. Gaines, a sixth-round pick who made the team. Sam blew a kiss and waved to the crowd, then walked back to the sideline. He posed for a few pictures then started looking at his phone and headed for the locker room. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft. Sam came out following his final season at Missouri. Historic: Sam, who came out in the months leading up to his drafting, celebrated with his boyfriend Vito Cammisanoon live television when he got the girl of his initial selection in May. However ESPN received complaints about airing a kiss between the pair . The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news of his drafting in May . Rams coach Jeff Fisher was proud to have made the landmark pick, but he made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it. The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall. He kissed his boyfriend as a national television audience looked on, and arrived brimming with confidence and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out. The cameras followed, but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates. Veteran defensive end Chris Long noted rosters are always made up of players from different backgrounds. One by one, players said Sam was now part of their family. Coach Jeff Fisher called the draft pick a 'second historic moment' for a franchise that signed running back Kenny Washington in 1946 as the league's first black player in the modern era, but he was most interested in describing Sam as a way to upgrade the Rams' defense. So was general manager Les Snead, who referred to Sam after the draft as a 'designated pass rusher'. Sam recognized the challenge, so he shed weight to be faster for special teams duty, reporting at 257 pounds. After the Rams' first preseason game, a 26-24 loss to New Orleans, Fisher said Sam played 'pretty well' but also made his share of mistakes. Sam, who was credited with one tackle and one quarterback hit in the game, emerged with confidence. 'You know, I can play in this league,' Sam said. 'I can play in this league.' Sam told his teammates at Missouri that he was gay before his senior year, and judging by the results it was no distraction at all. Dreams on hold: Sam still has a chance of being picked up by another team, despite being cut by the Rams. The Rams may still choose him for practice squad . The Tigers made a seven-win improvement and tied the school record with 12 wins. Sam had 11 1/2 sacks and the lightly-regarded Tigers won the SEC Eastern Division, a huge step forward after going 5-7 during the first season in their new conference. More than 100 coaches and players kept the revelation to themselves. Sam came out in February. 'If you look at our season, it didn't hurt us at all,' recalled cornerback E.J. Gaines, a fellow rookie and former Missouri teammate. 'If anything, it brought us closer.' Sam was lightly regarded out of Hitchcock, Texas, a town of about 7,000 along the Gulf Coast about 40 miles southeast of Houston. His first two years at Missouri, Sam backed up Aldon Smith and Jacquies Smith, both of whom are in the NFL. The Rams drafted Sam even though they didn't need help at defensive end, where they have a pair of first-round picks as starters. The Rams were so well-stocked with picks, taking 11 players overall, they had leeway to take a shot. Fisher said Sam's value as a player 'was off the charts'. Michael Sam, the first openly gay athlete drafted into the NFL, was cut by the St. Louis Rams as the team trimmed its roster ahead of the start of the 2014 season . 'I'm determined to be great,' Sam said at his introductory news conference, packed with reporters. 'I understand that right now you guys want to make a big deal of it.' From the start, teammates seemed to like having Sam around. His energy was infectious and, if there were problems, they stayed behind closed doors. Publicly, Sam was just another late-round pick trying to make the Rams, which, like other NFL teams, held sensitivity training early in camp. The Oprah Winfrey Network put off a planned documentary on Sam, saying it would allow him to focus on his dream of making the team. At one point, Sam's Rams jersey was the No. 2 seller among rookies at NFLShop.com, trailing only Cleveland's Johnny Manziel, and Sam was among just 10 draftees selected by the NFL to be featured on commemorative coins. Sam headed to the ESPY Awards to pick up the Arthur Ashe Courage award. He got a hug from Hall of Famer Jim Brown on his way to the stage and fought back tears throughout his speech. 'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself,' he told the audience.","Michael Sam, 24, was the first openly gay athlete drafted into the NFL .

"Former American Idol star Clay Aiken took to the polls in his home state of North Carolina on Tuesday morning as he battled it out to win his local congressional seat in the midterm elections. In the end however, Aiken, the one-time special education teacher who finished a narrow runner-up  in the 2003 Idol final, lost his challenge to 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers. The Democratic candidate's day got off to a bad start, as after he cast his vote at Mills Park Elementary School in Cary just before 9 a.m. his tour bus stalled. Former American Idol star Clay Aiken took to the polls in his home state of North Carolina on Tuesday morning . Authorities in Cary had to assist Aiken's bus - emblazoned with the slogan ‘Clay for North Carolina’ on the side - after it came to a shuddering halt just up the road from the polling station. Aiken, 35, and his team were hoping the mechanical malfunction wasn’t a bad omen in a race in which he wass very much the underdog after Republicans redrew the congressional map in 2011 - shifting the district's demographics to the right - but in the end Aiken could not emerge victorious. Since becoming a national TV sensation 11 years ago, Aiken has enjoyed stints on Broadway in Monty Python's Spamalot and on television in The Celebrity Apprentice. He also made the cover of People magazine when he announced in 2008 that he was gay. On the campaign trail, Aiken has also managed to cause quite a stir in his first attempt at running for political office. The Democratic candidate, who was challenging 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers, cast his vote at Mills Park Elementary School in Cary just before 9 a.m. Aiken received almost 12 million votes nationwide while narrowly losing to Idol winner Ruben Studdard in 2003 . 'I can get people to pay attention,' said Aiken at a town hall campaign event last month. 'It's a benefit of where I came from and how I got here.' While national Democratic groups haven't arrived with financial support, Aiken believes there's a path to victory in the U-shaped district. He had been trying to attract independent and Republican voters who recall his appearances as a crooner, and been hoping to catch breaks on the waves of unhappiness with Republican state government and gridlocked Washington politics. 'People are very dissatisfied with congress in general and getting absolutely nothing done,' said Aiken. He had accused Ellmers, a nurse, of being wrongly fixated on repealing President Obama's signature health care law, rather than fixing its problems. 'If after three or four years, you still haven't gotten anything done, then what are you getting paid for?' Clay Aiken, Democratic candidate for U.S. Congress in North Carolina's Second District, poses for a selfie with supporters after casting his vote in the midterm elections on Tuesday . Ellmers, who like Aiken was a first-time candidate four years ago when she upset Democratic Rep. Bob Etheridge, had thrown his political inexperience back at Aiken and suggested he's role-playing to win votes. 'He's an entertainer. He's an actor,' Ellmers, 50, said. 'He believes that he can change costume and get into character and speak to whichever group and win them over.' Ellmers was a favorite in the district, anchored by Fort Bragg, affluent suburbs west of Raleigh, retirees near the famous Pinehurst golf resort and solid red south of Greensboro. The 2011 redistricting made the district swing more Republican, as Mitt Romney received nearly 58 percent of the 2012 presidential vote there, according to an analysis by the business advocacy group the North Carolina Chamber. Aiken raised more than $1 million for his campaign since February, benefiting from Broadway and Los Angeles events along the way. Ellmers, who has raised more than $1.8 million this cycle, is battling anti-incumbent sentiment. Aiken has tried to distance himself from Obama, saying he disagrees with him on issues and believes several changes should be made to the president's signature health care law. Aiken had 'presented himself as a very credible candidate and I think some people wondered whether that would be the case,' said Scott Falmlen, a longtime Democratic political consultant in Raleigh, who isn't working with Aiken. 'He comes across as knowledgeable of the issues.' Aiken had tried to distance himself from Obama, saying he disagrees with him on issues and believes several changes should be made to the president's signature health care law. But during their lone televised debate, Ellmers contended that, in the end, 'you support Obamacare.' Aiken is a gay man running in a largely conservative district. Among passers-by in Erwin, it wasn't an issue. 'That's his choice, that's his life. It doesn't affect me at all,' said Susan Boggs, 38, of Erwin. Aiken supports gay marriage while Ellmers does not, though she publicly opposed the 2012 constitutional amendment in North Carolina that banned gay marriage. Both said during their debate that the issue of same-sex marriage, which is being decided in federal courts across the country, is out of their hands. Aiken received almost 12 million votes nationwide while narrowly losing to Idol winner Ruben Studdard in 2003. This year, he edged out a well-known local businessman in the Democratic primary. It may take the ardent support of local Claymates - Aiken's fan base during his Idol run - to win the title of congressman.","The one-time special education teacher was challenging 2nd Congressional District incumbent Republican Renee Ellmers .

"From the squeak of a door to the sound of a bus and the song of a bird, the noises around you are unique to your environment - and all of them make up the Earth's 'voice.' To catalogue millions of these individual ambient noises, a university researcher from Indiana is using microphones and sensors to capture ‘every sound the Earth makes’. His project is designed to preserve the world's changing sounds, and they can also reveal clues about environmental damage. Scroll down for video . The Global Soundscapes map (pictured) features much more everyday sounds, including cars driving in Arizona and trains in Austria. These public sounds can be explored on the Global Soundscapes map, and sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording and type of sounds, as well as the location and date . Later this month, a series of microphones and sensors in Indiana will go online, designed to capture ambient sounds in the region. It follows the launch of the Global Soundscapes project, set up by Purdue professor Bryan Pijanowski in April, to coincide with Earth Day 2014. Both projects are designed to capture millions of natural sound recordings, which people around the world can take part in using the Global Soundscapes app for iOS and Android. The Global Soundscapes map features recordings made using the iOS and Android app. These public sounds can be explored by clicking red dots on the map. Yellow stars link through to separate databases that feature numerous sounds from a selected location. All the sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording and type of sounds, as well as the location and date. People can also use the map to listen specific sounds, depending on their mood. For example, the recordings can be filtered by sounds that ‘make me happy’ or ‘stress me out.’ They can additionally listen to the existinglibrary of 500,000 natural soundscape recordings from sites in Indiana, Costa Rica and elsewhere. All the recordings are added to a database of sounds Professor Pijanowski and his fellow researchers have been collecting since 1996. Sounds captured include a dawn chorus in a tropical rainforest in Madagascar, the sound of an ant colony, howls of grey wolves in Algonquin National Park in Ontario, Canada, and urban noises recorded an intersection in Tippecanoe County near the Purdue University campus. Elsewhere, the Global Soundscapes map features more everyday sounds, including cars driving in Arizona and trains in Austria. These public sounds can be explored on the Global Soundscapes map, and sounds can be filtered by the time of the recording, and type of sounds, as well as the location and date. People can use the map to listen specific sounds, depending on their mood.

The left-hand image is a soundscape depicting a dawn chorus recording in a tropical rain forest in Madagascar in 1996. A stream in the rainforest of Marojejy, Madagascar, is pictured right . He told The Verge he believes he’ll be able to hear changes in the soundscape as the climate evolves. Previous research has been able to identify dying coral reefs because the fish and other creatures have been quieter, or in some cases, silent, for example. ‘As I travel around the world, visiting remote nature parks, it is quite apparent to me that the quality of natural sounds is decreasing as habitats are degraded and animals go extinct,’ added Professor Pijanowski. ‘Sadly, we also are replacing these sounds with those made by humans, as noise from planes and cars penetrate deep into wild places on this planet.’ The app is available for iOS and Android, and users also have the option of taking pictures of the soundscapes or landscapes they are recording.","Ecologist Bryan Pijanowski is asking people to record sounds on an app .

"A computer server hosting information for Healthcare.gov, the flagship Obamacare website that millions of Americans have trusted with their social security numbers, income totals and other sensitive personal information, was the subject of a hacker attack earlier this summer, officials said Thursday. The federal government wasn't aware it had been hacked on July 8 until just ten days ago. The admission is fueling fires on Capitol Hill. The powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee announced Thursday afternoon that it has ordered Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) chief Marilyn Tavenner to testify in a September 18 hearing about the Obamacare website's security lapses. Still need health coverage? The main Obamacare website was vulnerable to attack for nearly 7 weeks but malicious code inserted by hackers was never activated . 'Considering this administration launched Healthcare.gov over the objections of CMS, it's unsurprising that the website has suffered a ""malicious attack"",' said committee chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican lawmaker. 'For nearly a year, the administration has dismissed concerns about the security of Healthcare.gov, even as it obstructed congressional oversight of the issue. ... Tavenner must testify on the subject of transparency, accountability, and information security alongside the Government Accountability Office at our September 18th hearing.' A congressional staffer told MailOnline that a briefing from Tavenner's agency revealed that malicious code inserted by the hackers was still dormant when technicians discovered it on August 25. HHS and Department of Homeland Security investigators said there was no evidence consumer information was compromised, but conceded that some of the Internet addresses where the attacks originated were located overseas. This isn't the first computer security flaw found in Healthcare.gov's miles of code. In late October 2013, just four weeks after the website was switched on and became a butt of jokes for its crash-prone flailing, a private software tester showed it was easy to hijack an account by resetting its password. Another computer glitch temporarily caused Healthcare.gov users to see endless strings of garbled text instead of words when they tried to log into the system last November. A security expert told MailOnline at the time that the flaw was evidence that the sprawling federal government shouldn't be trusted with such a wide-ranging project that could leave millions of people without recourse if skeptics' worst fears were realized. In this case, however, government officials claim sensitive information was never at risk. Rep. Darrell Issa (right) used his House Oversight Committee chairmanship to subpoena Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Marilyn Tavenner (left) for a September 18 congressional showdown . 'Our review indicates that the server did not contain consumer personal information; data was not transmitted outside the agency, and the website was not specifically targeted,' the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a statement. 'We have taken measures to further strengthen security.' An FBI official told The Wall Street Journal that although some of the HHS server's attackers were believed to be foreigners, the government doesn't believe a state-sponsored operation, like those well-documented to have come from China, was behind it. Because of a security flaw, a server that was not supposed to be accessible from the Internet was available accessed was not meant to be connected to the Internet, the Journal reported. 'There was a door left open,' an official told the newspaper. That door was a password that was still set to its default factory-fresh value when hackers probed it. A senior Homeland Security official told the Journal that 'if this happened anywhere other than Healthcare.gov, it wouldn't be news' – a chilling suggestion that government servers are vulnerable more frequently than Americans know. The attacked Obamacare server has been disconnected from other systems, officials said Thursday, and retired from use. Still need My.ACCOUNT.SIGNUP.BUTTON??? The Obamacare website's login process was a mess last November, another sign that the government may not have been ready for prime time . System down: Healthcare.gov began its online life as a serial punchline after Americans couldn't access its signup features and untold numbers were forced to sign up on paper . Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Senate health committee's senior Republican, blasted HHS on Thursday as more details of the tech failure emerged. 'This security failure is unacceptable – this administration has an obligation to keep Americans' personal information safe and secure from computer hackers,' Alexander said in a statement, and default passwords won’t cut it.' 'In the coming days, I will be seeking information from Secretary Burwell on how she plans to guard against this kind of security breach.' The code inserted by the unknown hackers was of the type intended to lay in waiting, like a terrorist sleeper-cell, until it's called upon later to bombard other servers with repeated requests designed to slow it down. National Review reported Thursday that computer systems tied to state-based health insurance exchanges have also been targeted by malicious overseas hackers. In one case, the magazine recounted, 'a Romanian hacker gained access to the health exchange’s development server for a month' before software developers managed to find out.","Malicious code was inserted into an Obamacare server and lay dormant, waiting for a command to attack other computers .

"Police have found more than 850 'stolen' objects in a tiny pond - including precious jewellery, pistols and a machete -  thanks to one very curious dog. An unsuspecting woman was walking her pet in Whitebeam Woods near Worthing, West Sussex, when it scampered away and returned with a soggy jacket. When the pet made another dive and brought up a pair of cufflinks, the owner called police who discovered and retrieved an astonishing hoard of missing treasure. Scroll down for video . Haul: Police in Worthing, West Sussex, recovered more than 850 items including handguns, a machete and hundreds of pieces of stolen jewellery from a secluded pond after a curious dog dived in and found cufflinks . Sentimental: One of the bracelets was engraved simply with the name Karen. The objects are believed stolen . Mystery: There are few clues to be had from the watches, which all appear to have stopped at a different time . The mud-clogged underwater cache included pistols, earrings, watches, necklaces, rings, brooches, cufflinks, coins and even a large machete. Many are believed to be precious, sentimental items which were stolen from victims' homes and which thieves were then unable to sell. One bracelet was engraved simply: 'Karen'. Forensics officers who are more used to examining murders and rapes spent weeks painstakingly cleaning the hundreds of objects so they could be identified. Scores of images of the huge cache have now been uploaded to Sussex Police's website in the hope the owners will come forward. Search: A specialist police search team went into the pond and retrieved the hundreds of dumped items . Small: The cache of almost 1,000 sentimental treasures was crammed into a space just a few yards wide . Is this yours? A diver with one of the objects after it was retrieved. They have since been painstakingly cleaned . A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'We don't know whether it's things that they couldn't sell or whether they've panicked and had to throw everything away. 'What we do know is the items weren't in bags and a lot of them were not designed to be in the water, so it's unlikely someone was using it as an underwater storage tank. 'It's not the sort of place you go to as a passer-by so we believe whoever dumped these objects probably had a knowledge of the area.' He added: 'A lot of these items are going to be very personal and sentimental. Some of them are engraved. 'They may not have any great financial value but the owners will be able to describe them in great detail.' Necklaces: Officers said many items are likely to have little financial worth but will be highly recognisable . Crime: Crucially once more objects begin to be claimed police will have more chance of finding the thieves . Characteristic: The items taken from the pond included a whole section of owl-based pendants and earrings . Currency: Some of the items have more value than others - and there are a number of rusting coins in the heap . The dog-owner first raised the alarm over the mammoth find on July 23, triggering a hunt by Sussex Police's specialist search unit. There is no vehicle access to the pond, and officers believe it would have been a weighty haul for one person to carry through the woods on their own. The treasure was also found scattered across the bed of the pond, suggesting it was dumped on separate trips or by multiple people. A handful of the the items' owners have now come forward, providing police with vital details about how the objects were connected. Precious: None of the items were put in bags before they were scattered into disparate parts of the pond . Old and new: Some of the items are encrusted with jewels and would likely have been reported stolen before . A police spokesman said: 'A lot of these items are going to be very personal and sentimental' There is no vehicle access to the pond, and officers believe it would have been a weighty haul for one person . Scores of images of the huge cache, thought to be one of the largest of its kind, have been put online . Detective Constable Emma Fields said: 'We have already identified some of the items as having been stolen in burglaries in Sussex but we want to find out who owns the rest of them'. The full list is available online . Detective Constable Emma Fields said: 'Many of these items are not particularly expensive but could hold great personal value to the owners.

"A four-year-old who is pictured copying the outfits and poses of celebrities and models on Instagram is now being hailed a style influencer himself. 'Mini Style Hacker' Ryker Wixom, from Los Angeles, California, whose account has almost 178,000 followers, now looks set to be paid by big name brands for appearances in future posts. Ryker's mother, Collette Wixom, says she already gets lots of emails from brands on a daily basis. Footwear brand Skechers, in particular, sends sneakers for the preschooler to wear. Scroll down for video . Style influencer: Ryker Wixom, four, is the star of the Instagram account Mini Style Hacker. Now major brands are so eager to feature in future posts, they are prepared to pay for the opportunity . Not that she dresses Ryker in just anything. Mrs Wixom, who works full time and runs the Instagram account in her free time, tells MailOnline: 'I only work with or accept clothing from brands that I would actually purchase from. 'The majority of the time, I am styling my boys with their existing wardrobe or items that I have selected on my own.' To make the most of the Instagram account's financial potential, Mrs Wixom has now appointed agencies Instafluence and Reach which help pair brands with tastemakers and style influencers. She hopes that with the agencies' help, she may be able to quit her job in publishing within the next year. She admitted that she never anticipated this level of success when she started sharing photos of her son online. Fruitful enterprise: Ryker's poses, which mimic those of models and fashion bloggers, have earned the Mini Style Hacker Instagram account almost 178,000 followers . A-list attitude: Ryker and a friend take on the poses of celebrity couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds . Too cool for preschool: Ray Ban shades, a Gap sweater and a black-and-white filter are all Ryker needs to mimic this photo of Pharrell Williams . 'I was very surprised when brands started reaching out,' she told CNBC. 'This is all very new to me... I started this to do something creative and fun other than sword-fighting and mud pie-making. I never imagined it would become what it is today.' From the brands' perspective, it is a canny move. Sophia Greene, founder of London-based fashion agency 5th House PR, says Instagram is now a integral part of marketing for brands. 'It is the most authentic way for a celebrity or opinion-former to endorse a brand and can push sales and brand awareness to a huge audience instantly, she told MailOnline. '40 to 60 per cent of some of our brands' sales were directly thanks to Instagram last year.' Mrs Wixom says that when she is paid to post on Instagram, she always discloses the fact to followers. And for now, all profits are being saved in a college fund for Ryker and his little brother Grey, almost two, who makes occasional cameos on the Mini Style Hacker site. Family affair: Ryker's mother Collette Wixom is the real talent behind Mini Style Hacker. Younger son Grey (right) also makes occasional cameos on the Instagram page . For Ryker's part, posing for his mother's photos is pure entertainment. Mrs Wixom writes on the Mini Style Hacker blog: 'We use our imaginations a ton and have a great time while doing so. If you see him with his hands in his pockets, he is holstering his imaginary laser guns. 'If you see him leaning against a wall, he is trying to push it over with his body weight.' Of course, it is a priority for Mrs Wixom that the Mini Style Hacker project remains fun for Ryker. 'I don't want it to be something he doesn't like doing,' she said. 'He is a four-year old. He's not a model kid who will do whatever I say.' But the concept of the blog itself is entirely lost on Ryker, she adds to CNBC. 'I've showed him the blog, and he asks me why guys dress like him,' she said. 'I say, ""I don't know, they must really like your style.""'

"Mentally ill: Claude Alexander Allen III was ruled guilty but mentally ill in the murder of his friend . The son of a former top aide to President George W. Bush has pleaded guilty to hacking a friend to death with a tomahawk last year. Claude Alexander Allen III, 21, will be sent to a state psychiatric facility after mental health examiners concluded that he was suffering 'complex delusions and disorganized thinking' when he brutally murdered Michael Phillip Harvey in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in May 2013. Allen is the oldest son of Claude Allen II, who served as the assistant to the President for domestic policy from 2005 until 2006. The elder Mr Allen resigned after he was arrested for shoplifting. A subsequent investigation revealed that he had been taking items from store shelves in Target and Hecht's and 'returning' them - racking up $5,000 in a year. All this, despite earning a salary of $160,000 from the White House. The Washington Post reports that the younger Allen was at his parents' home with Harvey and another friend on May 23, 2013 when he became convinced that Harvey was trying to hurt him. A state psychiatrist's report says that Allen's psychotic delusions led him to believe that Harvey was a member of a rival gang and that he might attack. Allen also believed that Harvey had been stealing from him and was trying to make him sell drugs. Top aide: Allen's father Claude Allen II was assistant to President George W. Bush for domestic policy until he was forced to resign when he was arrested for shoplifting . Allen then grabbed a 'tactical tomahawk' that he had bought online and hit his friend Harvey in the head and neck five times until he was dead. Allen then told his other friend 'I took care of the person who broke in,' prosecutors said, according to the Post. After Allen pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on Tuesday, Judge Terrence McGann found him not criminally liable, based on reports from psychiatrists. Allen will be sent to the Clifton T. Perkins psychiatric facility, where he will be held until a judge finds that he is no longer a threat to the community.

"They are known as being among the most dangerous predators in the world, but these four lions were left with their tails between their legs after they were brought down a peg or two by a brave mongoose. Despite being much smaller than its four challengers, the aggressive mongoose growled at the big cats and even bit one of them on the nose.

It did not take long however for the mongoose to show the lions exactly what it was made of . It soon became apparent however that the carnivore, while being less than 2ft tall, could handle itself as it avoided each attack by dodging and growling at the lions. The mongoose finally managed to escape from the predators into a nearby hole, but remarkably re-emerged to re-engage the confused cats. Mr Guillaumot, 54, from Montpellier, in France, said: 'She was watching out for the lions that were still around. 'Then against all odds, she ran out of her hiding place and the fight resumed. Why did she take this risk? Impossible to know. 'But she was still fighting fiercely. In some way, the confrontation changed. The lions seemed confused, uncertain what to do.'

The group agreed with a US government agency to submit to external audits of how well it guards users' data. But Facebook has faced a backlash in recent months after it forced its users to download its Messenger app. Facebook announced the plan in June in its latest response to concerns about privacy, following criticism over its data mining practices for marketing purposes . Many raised concerns about the app’s permissions, that give Facebook access to send texts and make calls on the user’s device. According to Google Play, the app has access to find accounts on the device, read contacts, access the user’s, as well as edit, read and receive text messages. Other permissions give Facebook the ability to directly call phone numbers, modify or delete files on USB storage, take pictures and videos, record audio, download files without notification, control vibration and change network connectivity.

"Self-described 'dissident feminist' Paglia, 66, believes that attempts to deny the biological distinctions between men and women is to blame for the much that is wrong with modern society . Our society is neutering boys of their maleness at a young age, while the lack of people with military experience in important positions is a recipe for disaster, claims Camille Paglia, the controversial lesbian author and social critic. Self-described ‘dissident feminist’ Paglia, 66, believes that attempts to deny the biological distinctions between men and women is to blame for the much that is wrong with modern society. 'What you're seeing is how a civilization commits suicide’ she told the Wall Street Journal. Paglia, a professor at the University . of the Arts in Philadelphia, is well known for her critical views on . many aspects of modern culture, including feminism and liberalism. She recently spoke out in support of Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson, supporting his right to express homophobic views. ‘In a democratic country, people have the right to be homophobic as well as they have the right to support homosexuality – as I one hundred percent do. 'If people are basing their views against gays on the Bible, again, they have a right of religious freedom there.' she told Laura Ingraham’s radio show last week. Paglia, who is promoting her latest book, Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art From Egypt To Star Wars, told the WSJ that the diminished status of military service in people in important positions is a big mistake. Our society is neutering boys of their maleness at a young age, right, while the lack of people with military experience in important positions is a recipe for disaster, left, claims Paglia . ‘The entire elite class now, in finance, in politics and so on, none of them have military service - hardly anyone, there are a few. But there is no prestige attached to it anymore. That is a recipe for disaster,’ she said. ‘These people don't think in military ways, so there's this illusion out there that people are basically nice, people are basically kind, if we're just nice and benevolent to everyone they'll be nice too. They literally don't have any sense of evil or criminality.’ According to Paglia the results are there for all to see in the on-going dysfunction in Washington, where politicians ‘lack practical skills of analysis and construction’. The emancipation of masculine virtues is something that is beginning as early as kindergarten in the U.S., argues Paglia. The decline of America's industrial base is another factor that the author believes is leaving many men with 'no models of manhood' ‘Primary-school education is a crock, basically. It's oppressive to anyone with physical energy, especially guys,’ she said. The author, who along with her ex-partner Alison Maddex, is raising an 11-year-old son Lucian, believes that the way many schools have cut recess is ‘making a toxic environment for boys.’ ‘Primary education does everything in its power to turn boys into neuters,’ she said. The decline of America's industrial base is another factor that the author believes is leaving many men with ‘no models of manhood.' ‘Masculinity is just becoming something that is imitated from the movies. There's nothing left. There's no room for anything manly right now.’ Elite upper-middle-class women have become 'clones' condemned to 'Pilates for the next 30 years', muses Paglia . Bizarrely Paglia claims that the only place that you can hear what men really feel these days is on sports radio. The professor claims to be an avid listener and that the energy and enthusiasm 'inspires me as a writer.' 'If we had to go to war,' the callers 'are the men that would save the nation.' Paglia didn't spare the role of women in her musings and said that elite upper-middle-class women have become 'clones' condemned to 'Pilates for the next 30 years.' 'Our culture doesn't allow women to know how to be womanly,' she said. Camille Paglia, is a self styled 'dissident feminist', outspoken on pop culture, and who has been described as a feminist bete noire. The 66-year-old has been a professor at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA since 1984, but  came to attention with the publication of her first book, 'Sexual Personae', in 1990, when she also began writing about popular culture and feminism in mainstream newspapers and magazines. It is these articles which have propelled Paglia to the controversial figure she is today. One scathing attack saw her conclude that Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, have 'insipid, bleached-out personas' that hark back to the man-pleasing, pre-feminist era. In an article for The Hollywood Reporter, she wrote that as a result, many of today's young women fail to realize the role their sexuality plays in society and 'partying till you drop has gotten as harmless as a Rotary Club meeting'. She said: 'Swift’s meandering, snippy songs make 16-year-old Lesley Gore’s 1963 hit It’s My Party (And I’ll Cry if I Want to) seem like a towering masterpiece of social commentary, psychological drama and shapely concision. 'Indeed, without her mannequin posturing at industry events, it’s doubtful that Swift could have attained her high profile.' She cuttingly described Perry as a 'manic cyborg cheerleader'. Paglia previously slammed Lady Gaga, insisting her over-the-top sexuality is actually 'stripped of genuine eroticism'. She said the star's willingness to dress in crazy outfits as an example of 'every public appearance... has been lavishly scripted in advance'.","The self-described 'dissident feminist' believes society is neutering boys of their maleness at a young age .

Manager Pearson confirmed talks have progressed with the former Inter Milan midfielder, who is available on a free transfer. The ex-Argentina international could be in before Leicester host Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday ahead of Monday's transfer deadline. Closing in: Leicester boss Nigel Pearson is eyeing three new players and is nearing Esteban Cambiasso . En route?

Pearson said: 'Cambiasso is still a possibility. There's been progress over the weekend so I'm more hopeful than I was on Friday and Saturday but until there is a definitive answer I'm loath to talk too much. But I am hopeful it can be done in next couple of days. 'We've been trying to do business and it has not materialised so far. But hopefully this week we can still do business and bring players in we want to bring in. 'I recognise there is a need for added numbers and we have to do that in this window. There are subtle differences this year to last year. 'We've been very positive but it is nice to have different options. Two or three hopefully is the aim. It would be nice to be able to achieve that.'

"Host commentator . An awful second half from Real Madrid, who started so positively. A blow to their La Liga credentials already? Not quite, but this just proves buying attackers doesn't always mean results... 86mins: Slight chance for Sami Khedira but his header goes voer the bar from the corner. Game. Over. Real have really thrown this away, and it's a former Arsenal man who finishes them off...surely. The forward chests the ball down from a corner and fires a volley into the roof of the net. 74mins: Sociedad holding firm. Can't believe this is the same side we saw in the first half! Can you believe this? What a turnaround! It's that man David Zurutuza again who gets in front of Pepe to convert a drilled cross from Xabi Prieto. No chance for Casillas, but what a story this is. 57mins: Real just not playing at the same pace right now. Bale misplaces a cross from the right after a slow break, while James Rodriguez doesn't seem to know his place in this side. 53mins: In contrast to the start of the first half, Sociedad are well on top now. Much more energy, and it does help when the fans aren't getting on your back I'm sure! 48mins: Real Sociedad nearly take the lead! Agirretxe gets up for a free header, with Casillas rushing out, and luckily for the keeper the ball canons off his thigh and out for a corner. What an entertaining first-half that was! Strange how a game can change on its head so quickly. The visitors started so well, looking like they'd make double figures before half-time, but two wonderful crosses later and Sociedad are level. More to come, folks! Very much game on! What was I thinking writing the hosts off? David Zurutuza is as brave as can be as he nets his diving header, benefiting from another wonderful cross. Trouble in paradise for the visitors. Game on! Not sure Sociedad have deserved this, but I'll take it! Fantastic corner from the right, Xavi Prieto flicks it on at the near post and Inigo Martinez taps in at the back. Simple. Still think Madrid have got more goals in them, though... 33mins: Real go close again. Suicidal defending from the hosts, who lose it 30 yards from goal. The boys in pink pounce and Toni Kroos should have done better after being slid through on goal. Decent save from the keeper again, mind. 27mins: Finally a dangerous attack from the hosts, but what a block by Sergio Ramos! Esteban Granero meets a knock down with a fierce volley from 10 yards out but the defender throws his body in the way to get it clear. He's having an alright game, isn't he? 24mins: Real just look so dangerous going forward. It's Marcelo again who gets the final shot away this time, but it's well saved by Zubikarai. All coming down that left-hand side. 20mins: It nearly gets worse for the hosts. De La Bella plays a poor back pass and goalkeeper Zubikarai gets lucky when jumping up for a header with Benzema. Seconds later Marcelo's effort flies just wide. 17mins: Gareth Bale now joining Benzema up front, making this very much a 4-4-2. James Rodriguez, who has hardly been involved, is now on the left and Isco right. Can't see the hosts getting into this one somehow, these 'new Galacticos' look brilliant. 11mins: Brilliant, just brilliant from Gareth Bale. The winger receives the ball into feet, nutmegs the defender, then places his effort into the bottom corner. This could get nasty. 9mins: Ramos nearly makes it two! This time the centre back (yes, centre back) crashes his free-kick against the post. Ideal start for the visitors, but a blow for Real Sociedad (and the neutrals!). Ramos is inexcusably left unmarked at the corner and makes no mistake in powering his header into the bottom corner. Uphill task for the hosts now. 4mins: Early look at this Real formation, and it's Bale on the left, Isco behind Benzema and James right. Plenty of options should they want to change it though. Away we go! Real all in pink tonight. Or should I say 'Fuschia' SIMON JONES: Real Madrid have held further conversations with Manchester United as they press to take Javier Hernandez on loan. The Mexico striker will leave United on Monday and the Santiago Bernabeu is looking increasingly like his next destination. Real, who have Karim Benzema as their only recognised centre forward, opened discussions on Saturday with the player being informed of their interest while returning from Saturday's game with Burnley. Ronaldo rested tonight to avoid further injuries, he'll have three weeks off. Carlo Ancelotti certainly has other options though. James, Isco and Gareth Bale start behind Karim Benzema, with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos behind them. Sandro scores to put Barcelona 1-0 up against Villarreal. What have you got now, Real? Kick-off is 20 minutes away. Zubikarai, Elustondo, Bergara, Iñigo, Granero, Agirretxe, X.Prieto, Zurutuza, Chory, Zaldua, De la Bella . Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, James, Isco, Bale, Benzema . Barcelona are in action at the moment, drawing 0-0 against Villarreal... but what about Real Madrid? They kick off at 8pm against Real Sociedad, and team news is now filtering in. More to follow.","Ramos meets corner in fifth minute to put visitors in front .

"Former Fulham defender John Arne Riise has blasted under-fire manager Felix Magath.

Riise said on Magath: 'With his arrival, they've flushed everything [that club stands for] down the toilet. His methods are ancient. 'Spoke to a few players after the Derby match. Once they returned to London, Magath ordered a team meeting at 10.30pm. 'Then the next morning [which is normally their day off], players were ordered to run for one hour, then another training session at 2.30pm. It's not the way to get the boys going. And training methods are terrible.' Misery: Fulham's Scott Parker looks dejected as the west London side lose 1-0 against Wolves . Riise, who is a free agent after leaving Craven Cottage at the end of last season, believes Fulham's top brass are to blame for the west London side's recent demise. 'All football sessions are 11 v 11, working on tactics,' added Riise. 'Interrupted every five minutes. It's a shame, but I fear for Fulham. 'Responsibility lies with Magath and the guys upstairs [directors]. They knew exactly what they were getting with this guy. 'I really like Fulham.

"The family of a marathon cyclist murdered by a deranged homeless man have told how he went out of his way to help destitute people. Kevin Adorno was biking from Maryland to Miami, where he planned to propose to his girlfriend, when he was stabbed outside a McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida. As his family and friends gathered to celebrate his life, Kevin's eldest brother John told MailOnline: 'He used to go to a bar where there was a homeless guy and he not only knew his name, every time he went there he bought the guy a hot dog. Soul mates: Kevin Adorno, 28, and Elyse Fuggetta, 26, met three years ago at his cousin's wedding and he immediately wooed her with a big bouquet of flowers, his family tells MailOnline. The couple were meeting up in Miami and he was just two hours away when he made the fatal pit stop at McDonald's . Life cycle: Kevin, who was stabbed to death by a homeless man, when he made a pit stop at a McDonald's in Vero Beach, Florida. He embraced life and loved talking to people he met on his road trips, says his eldest brother John Adorno.  If the guy who attacked him had needed something, Kevin would have given it to him' Sealed with a kiss: 'The engagement ring he picked out was in his pocket,' said Kevin's sister, Tanya Adorno . 'That's the sort of person Kevin was. He'd give you his last cigarette, his last dollar. 'He embraced life and he loved talking to people he met on the road. If the guy who attacked him had needed something, Kevin would have given it to him.' The 28-year-old artist, who ran his own graphic design business in Unionville, Connecticut, had stopped off to grab food when he was attacked by 59-year-old Rene Herrera Cruz on Monday night. Kevin was chatting on the phone to his soon-to-be fiancé Elyse Fuggetta when the seemingly random stabbing happened. Elyse, 26, told police that the phone suddenly went dead. Kevin managed to stagger back into McDonalds bleeding from several stab wounds before collapsing. He was pronounced dead shortly afterwards . His sister Tanya, 29, told MailOnline how her romantic brother was secretly planning to propose to Elyse once he reached Miami. 'The engagement ring he had picked out was in his pocket,' she said. 'The only person who knew about it was our mother. 'Along the route he spotted another antique set of rings. He took a photograph and texted mom to see what she thought. She told him to stick with his original choice. 'Elyse was going to join him on the final leg of the ride, 20 miles from Miami. She didn't know it but that's when he planned to propose to her. 'He was a big romantic with Elyse. They met three years ago at our cousin's wedding and immediately afterwards he wooed her with a big bouquet of flowers. 'Their relationship was instantaneous. They both knew they'd met THE one. She completed him. 'Elyse is just distraught. She is too upset to even speak. They loved each other so much. 'Kevin was the baby of our family.

Kevin, right, adored his brothers Robert, on his two wheeler, and John and sister Tanya . Kevin, left, with his brothers and sisters grew up in the pretty New England town of Farmington, Connecticut . 'I remember he was even romantic with his own family. On Valentine's Day as a teenager I would find a single flower on my windshield. It was always from Kevin. He wanted me to know I was loved. 'He embraced life and had a bucket list of things he wanted to do. 'Last year we were invited to a wedding in Maryland. He decided to cycle there and invited me to join him. 'We set off from my home in Maine and cycled slowly down the coast, stopping every two to three hours. It was an amazing experience. I've driven that route by car many times yet you see it differently from a cycle. 'The world looks very different from the bike saddle and Kevin wanted to carry on and do the entire East Coast trip. 'He set off in mid August and called us all every night from the road. 'Kevin was full of great stories about the people he met. He just loved to talk to people. 'We're getting texts and messages from all sorts of people he met on his road trip.' Tanya and Kevin, along with older brothers John, 33, and Robert, 31, grew up in the pretty New England town of Farmington embracing their dad Angelo's Italian heritage and mother Helena's Polish roots. Happy:  Playful Kevin was crazy about soccer and taught his nephews a few tricks, Tanya said. 'They know how to kick a ball about because of Kevin' 'He was crazy about soccer and taught his nephews a few tricks,' Tanya said. 'They know how to kick a ball about because of Kevin.

Last night he was returning to the US to bury his baby son. 'We're planning a non-traditional ceremony for Kevin,' his brother John said. 'We don't know what yet but it will be something different because that's what Kevin would have wanted. 'Tonight we have a fire pit in the back yard – Kevin loved a fire pit, he always wanted to build the biggest and the best. 'He wasn't competitive, he just enjoyed doing things. It wasn't about winning or doing things best, he just wanted everyone to enjoy themselves.

"When Shelley Lamond lost her daughter Mabel to stillbirth in May last year she wasn't ready to say goodbye straight away. The hospital in Adelaide where she had her baby provided her with a 'cuddle cot' - piece of medical equipment that acts like a refrigerated bassinet and allows babies to stay in the room with their parents so they do not need to be taken straight to the morgue. Mrs Lamond, 39, and her husband Rick found the extra 48 hours they got to spend with Mabel so precious that they wanted to raise money to buy another one for other mothers to use. Scroll down for video . Shelley Lamond (right) and her husband Rick say goodbye to their daughter Mabel who was stillborn last May . Mrs Lamond was able to allow her children (from left) Tyson, 14, Stella, four, and Chloe, 12, to say goodbye thanks to a 'cuddle cot' A cuddle cot is piece of medical equipment that acts like a refrigerated bassinet and allows babies to stay in the room with their parents so they do not need to be taken straight to the morgue . Almost a year after Mabel's death she was four months pregnant again and had just donated a cuddle cot to a local charity when the unthinkable happened – she had another stillbirth. 'They had the cot there, I just never expected I'd be the first one to use it,' Mrs Lamond told Daily Mail Australia. Her waters broke early and on May 16 of this year her daughter Elsa was stillborn – 18 weeks and three days into the pregnancy. Mrs Lamond, who lives on a farm 112km north of Adelaide, said using a cuddle cot to buy extra time with Mabel and Elsa allowed her to say goodbye in a way she felt comfortable. 'That's the only time you get to spend with these precious babies,' she said. 'They're the only memories you're ever going to have with them.' Mrs Lamond knows how traumatic it is to have to say goodbye without a cuddle cot, because she has suffered four stillbirths in total. Mr and Mrs Lamond comfort each other after losing their daughter Mabel (left). Pictured right is Mabel lying in her comfort cot . Mrs Lamond donated this comfort cot to a local charity after Mabel's death and tragically was the first one to use it when she suffered another miscarriage in May this year - losing daughter Elsa at 18 weeks . Before her first stillbirth she had given birth to three children – Tyson, now 14, Chloe, 12 and Stella, 4. But during her fourth pregnancy her waters broke early and baby Matilda was delivered stillborn on December 11 2009. Since then she has suffered three more still births – Pearl in June 2012, Mable in 2013 and Elsa this year. Doctors have not been able to work out why. 'In the scenario where you haven't got a cuddle cot you have to buzz the nurse if you want to see your baby and they've then got to go get her [from the morgue],' she said. 'And then to see them walk in with a canvas bag and unzip a bag and your baby's lying in there. 'When I think back to that experience that was just awful seeing my baby in a green canvas bag.' Mrs Lamond knows how traumatic it is to have to say goodbye without a cuddle cot, because she has suffered four stillbirths in total . Her baby Matilda was delivered stillborn on December 11 2009. Since then she has suffered three more still births - Pearl in June 2012, Mable in 2013 and Elsa this year . Mrs Lamond said many people – even mothers who have stillbirths - don't know about cuddle cots because it's such a painful subject. 'It does make people feel uncomfortable, the death of a child, because it's really not the natural order of things,' she said. 'Other people haven't met that baby, only the parents, so they haven't made that connection. 'It's almost like it's not a real death. But it is.' Stillbirth Foundation Australia CEO Jan Samuels said cuddle cots were uncommon, because they cost about $5000 and were not priority equipment for hospitals. 'It's usually that mothers [who have had a stillbirth] want to buy one and donate to their local hospital,' Ms Samuels told Daily Mail Australia. Mrs Lamond said many people - even mothers who have stillbirths - don't know about cuddle cots because it's such a painful subject . 'But parents who have the opportunity to have them say it's important to be able to spend that time with the child.' In Australia six babies are stillborn every day. Stillbirth affects 2200 families per year and occurs in one in every 135 births. 'It's huge, and in around 40 percent of cases they never find out the cause,' Ms Samuels said. Mrs Lamond is currently fundraising to donate a second cuddle cot to charity Pregnancy Loss Australia, and is $700 away from her target. Joanne Stephenson, 34, is also currently trying to raise money to donate a cuddle cot to her local hospital. Mrs Stephenson, who lives in Woolooware in south Sydney with her husband Ross and three-year-old son Brodie, lost her daughter Amelia to stillbirth in August last year. Joanne Stephenson and her husband Ross lost their daughter Amelia to stillbirth in August last year . She didn't have access to a cuddle cot and had never heard of them at the time, and so she got to spend just seven hours with Amelia before saying goodbye. 'I wrote a poem which I read to her over and over,' Mrs Stephenson told Daily Mail Australia. 'We bathed her, I dressed her. We really just cuddled her and just held her. Mrs Stephenson is currently trying to raise money to donate a cuddle cot to her local hospital in memory of Amelia . 'That seven hours sounds like a long time but it just goes so quickly.' Afterwards her work colleagues helped her raise $8000 to donate to stillbirth charities, and she was researching ways to use the money when she came across cuddle cots. Mrs Stephenson said if she had had access to one the whole experience would have been very different. 'It definitely would have changed things because she would have been more real to my family and friends,' she said. 'No one got to meet her except me and my husband. 'Sometimes we feel uncomfortable, like people think she didn't exist so we should just get over it.' Earlier this year she donated one cuddle cot to Sutherland Hospital with the money her work had raised, and since then she has been contacted by a number of mothers thanking her for enabling them to use it. 'One mother got to spend 36 hours with their baby, which is five times the amount of time that we got,' she said. Mrs Stephenson is now 39 weeks pregnant and is due to give birth on Monday. She said it has been difficult emotionally given the trauma of losing Amelia. Earlier this year she donated one cuddle cot to Sutherland Hospital, and since then she has been contacted by a number of mothers thanking her for enabling them to use it. They are pictured here with their son Brodie . The Stephensons are now preparing to welcome a new sibling for Brodie on Monday, as she is now 39 weeks pregnant . 'It was quite hard to even think forward and think ahead and try to be positive,' she said. 'I didn't even tell anybody for ages, I just didn't feel comfortable with people getting excited for me when I wasn't excited myself.' But after marking what would have been Amelia's first birthday last Friday, Mrs Stephenson feels like she is ready. 'I feel better, I feel really good at the moment,' she said.

"Confusion reigns over the identity of the brutal ISIS executioner known as 'Jihadi John' after security experts now appear to dismiss suggestions he is a former rapper from west London. The masked man, who speaks with a clear London accent, has appeared in two chilling videos showing him beheading American journalists and issuing a threat to kill a British hostage.

Brutal: It has been suggested that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, a rapper from West London, could be the man who killed James Foley and Steven Sotloff. Here is pictured holding a severed head in the Syrian city of Raqqa . The executioner is understood to be known as 'John' because he travelled to join ISIS in Syria along with three other Britons, with the foursome dubbed 'The Beatles' by their fellow militants. In the wake of James Foley's murder last month, Britain's ambassador to the U.S. Sir Peter Westmacott said the UK was 'very close' to identifying the killer . European hostages freed earlier this year have identified the Briton as being one of three jailers they dubbed 'The Beatles', who guarded them and oversaw torture and mock executions. During extensive 'debriefings' with intelligence officers, the hostages were shown pictures of suspected UK and other European jihadists. The former captives are understood to have been able to recognise around eight Britons they had 'come into contact' with during their months of captivity in a dozen locations around Syria. A shortlist of British men who might have been the murderer of Mr Foley, who was kidnapped 22-months ago, was drawn up by the UK security services, FBI and Scotland Yard's counter terrorism command. A second list of Britons who may have come in to contact with him was also compiled. London accent: The ISIS executioner taunts Barack Obama before he kills US journalist Steven Sotloff. He is thought to be the same militant who killed James Foley, and tells the U.S. President 'I'm back' Cyber skills: Abu Hussain al-Britani, 20, whose real name is Junaid Hussain, was jailed for stealing personal information from Tony Blair. He left Birmingham for Syria and is reportedly launching cyber attacks on the West . A video posted on YouTube, and then deleted, is believed to show Sally Jones playing in a rock band in the early 1990s.  Jones may have converted to Islam and travelled to Syria after marrying Abu Hussain al-Britani . Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, is a former musician whose music has been played on BBC Radio 1. For more than a decade he lived with his mother Ragaa in a £1million house in Maida Vale, West London, which is owned by Westminster Council. He walked out of the family home in 2013 to fight in Syria, saying that he was 'leaving everything for the sake of Allah'. He later boasted about the battles he had fought. Friends said Bary – an aspiring rapper on the 'grime' music scene – grew increasingly radical and violent after mixing with thugs linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary. Bary is one of six children of Egyptian militant Adel Abdul Bary, who was granted political asylum in the UK in 1993. In 2012 he was extradited to the US, where he was wanted in connection to the 1998 United States embassy bombings in East Africa which killed hundreds of people. Investigators said that he helped to publicise statements claiming responsibility after the bombings. Bary Snr's eight-year legal battle made him a cause celebre of the Left as lawyers took his publicly funded case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Investigators believe Bary Snr was one of Bin Laden's closest lieutenants in the infancy of Al Qaeda and ran a London cell of the terror network. Bary Jr is believed to be the ringleader of the three extremists, according to the Sun. Many of those being investigated have used social media over the past two years to make postings and these have been studied for clues as to locations and associations – dozens of pictures have featured more than one person. Among those on the second list was Abdel Bary, 23, from West London, who travelled to Syria last year and has been linked to both 'John' and both the beheading videos. A neighbour of Bary, a rising music star whose father is due to stand trial in the US in connection with Al Qaeda-linked bombings of embassies in Africa, previously claimed she had been told that his home had been raided several days ago. Scotland Yard denied it had searched the address. The list also includes a former student, a computer hacker and a travel-guide writer. Sir Peter said 'sophisticated' voice recognition technology was  used to identify the suspect who delivered a long rant on the video of Foley's murder. The killer was not wearing gloves in the video as he gripped a knife in his left hand. A technique known as 'vein matching', which examines and compares veins on the hands and is among the tools investigators will use to identify him. This technique has previously been used successfully in another terrorism case – and is said to be 'proving of interest.' Referring to British citizens who to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight in the past few years, Sir Peter told CNN : 'It's not just about one brutal murderer - it is a threat to our citizens. 'People think that maybe as many as 500 British subjects have gone to Syria and Iraq for this cause of jihad. Militant: Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers . Identification: In the wake of James Foley's murder last month (pictured), Britain's ambassador to the U.S. Sir Peter Westmacott said the UK was 'very close' to identifying the killer . Abu Hussain al-Britani, who lived in Birmingham, was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former Prime Minister Tony Blair. He fled to Syria last year while on police bail. It has been reported that the jihadist, whose real name Junaid Hussian, is helping mastermind cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities to further swell IS war coffers. Hussain has not directly mentioned hacking  on Twitter, but a fellow fighter boasted of being bought pizza using celebrity's credit card details acquired by a jihadist hacker. This week it was claimed that Hussain was married to a middle-aged former rock musician and Islam convert from Kent called Sally Jones. Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, who often uses Twitter to post pro-IS propaganda, is believed to be behind social media accounts attempting to recruit teenagers. MailOnline revealed an account on the ask.fm social media site, believed to be operated by al-Britani, which gave self-identified youths advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and perks of the job from working with IS. Another message describes the 'welcome pack' new ISIS recruits receive when they complete theIr induction process. He is believed to be one of a group of men from Portsmouth who flew from London Gatwick to the tourist town of Antalya in Turkey, before crossing the border into Syria to join ISIS. Computer-aided landscape analysis has been used on horrific death video of Mr Foley and those images compared to satellite and surveillance pictures. These investigations are said to indicate it was probably taken close to the IS headquarters and stronghold of Raqqa in Syria. US and UK military commanders are now focusing their efforts on securing the 'electronic airspace' along the Syria border with the overall aim closing down IS's ability to communicate with other forces in Syria. After Foley's death, a senior UK source said: 'The current aim is to find and fix the command cell of Islamic State and then move to isolate other units in the mission to locate the executioner and bring him to justice... We have a mass of resources and the man will be found.'","Killer speaks with clear London accent in two sickening execution videos .

The politician was watching the men's 10m synchronised diving final in Edinburgh at the Commonwealth Games, which saw England's Tom Daley and James Denny claim silver. He smiled, gasped and held his hand to his mouth - all the while oblivious to the fan behind him, who gave the camera a knowing smile. The incident yesterday came days after a woman was escorted from the swimming arena by police for waving a Scottish flag with the word 'Yes' printed on it. Rules for spectators prevent banners with 'political messages' and police insisted the Saltire was allowed.

"Robin van Persie has warned Radamel Falcao he will have to fight for his place at Manchester United following his dramatic deadline day move. Falcao’s £6million loan from Monaco could become a permanent transfer worth £52m if the Colombia striker proves to be a success at Old Trafford, where he will earn £280,000 a week. But despite the departures of Danny Welbeck and Javier Hernandez on Monday, Van Persie believes Falcao still faces plenty of competition. VIDEO Scroll down for Radamel Falcao made his professional debut at 13 . Warning: Robin van Persie has warned Radamel Falcao he must fight for his place at Manchester United . New boy: Falcao moved to Old Trafford on loan from Monaco on Transfer Deadline Day . Baffled: Van Persie insists reports he is set for surgery are untrue and that he will not be having an operation . ‘I welcome his arrival, he makes us better,’ said the Holland striker. ‘At a top club you should always go for the best, which also fits my philosophy. ‘Falcao must fight for his place, as I also have to. We must battle with Wayne Rooney and James Wilson to see who is playing.’ Falcao is in Miami, where Colombia play Brazil in a friendly on Friday night, and he is hoping to secure a work permit in time to be available against Queens Park Rangers a week on Sunday. His father revealed yesterday that Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool were among the clubs who showed an interest in the 28-year-old. Radamel Garcia also claimed Real Madrid pulled out of the running because they would not commit to a financial package that will exceed £20m for one season. He said: ‘The deal with Real Madrid did not happen because if you have money and you go to buy a shirt or a pair of trousers, you have to decide whether to buy it or not — Real Madrid chose not to. I have a feeling they wanted the player free with a number of conditions. In any case, they bought the trousers and shirt they wanted and they considered that to be better. We have to accept it. ‘The clubs that showed an interest in him were Juventus, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal at the last minute. Thank God everything came through with United.’ Falcao’s arrival signalled Welbeck’s departure and the England striker claims he left for Arsenal in order to be the main man at a top-four club. Welbeck, 23, has been desperate to prove himself as a central striker in recent seasons. However, more often than not, for club and country, he has been utilised as wide player. But with injured Gunners striker Olivier Giroud out for four months, he will now be given his chance. One in, one out: Danny Welbeck sealed a move to Arsenal after Falcao's move to United was complete . ‘I’ve been at United ever since I was a little boy and I had a great time there,’ said Welbeck, speaking for the first time since his £16m move. ‘I believe in their style of play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away. ‘This is the next stage of my development, to really show people what I can do. I’d like to bring pace and power to the game. ‘I’ve envisaged myself playing in this team before. For it to finally happen is very exciting. ‘Arsenal have done well in recent years, last year we got the FA Cup and I feel like it’s time we could really push on and try and challenge for the Premier League title. ‘I’ve got one Premier League medal and it’s something that I really want to add to.’ United defender Guillermo Varela, David Moyes’s first signing at Old Trafford, has joined Real Madrid on loan until the end of the season having failed to make an appearance for the club.

"More than a thousand years ago, a huge volcano straddling the border between North Korea and China was the site of one of the biggest eruptions in human history, blanketing eastern Asia in its ash. But unlike other major volcanoes around the world, the remote and politically sensitive Mount Paektu remained almost a complete mystery to foreign scientists because they've been barred from on-site studies - until now. Two British scientists were given permission to study the mountain in an unprecedented joint project with North Korea and now say they may soon be able to reveal some secrets of the volcano, including its likelihood of erupting again. For the crater good: Clouds float over the peak of Mt. Paektu in North Korea's Ryanggang province - it's a volcano that British scientists have been granted permission to study to work out when it might erupt again . Feeling peaky: A North Korean woman walks on the peak of Mt. Paektu . They're collecting seismic data and studying rocks ejected in Paektu's 'millennium eruption' sometime in the 10th century. 'It's one of the biggest eruptions in the last few thousands of years and we don't have yet a historical date for it,' Clive Oppenheimer, a professor of volcanology at Cambridge University, told The Associated Press after returning to Pyongyang last week from an eight-day trip to the volcano. 'The rocks are a bit like the black box of a flight recording. There's so much that we can read from the field site itself.' For volcano researchers, studying Paektu is a golden opportunity to break new ground because so much about it remains a puzzle. Oppenheimer said it is not located along any of the tectonic locations that often explain volcanic activity, so just figuring out why it exists at all is one question that needs to be answered. Little or no historical chronicles of the millennium eruption exist, so scientists are also interested in piecing together what exactly happened, what the volcano and the ecosystem around it were like before the eruption and how life returned afterward. Paektu is considered sacred ground in both China and in North Korea, where it is seen as a symbol of the ruling Kim family and of the revolution that led to the founding of the country, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The fog clears: A North Korean  television station camera crew records the scenery from the peak of Mt. Paektu . On the North Korean side, the area around the mountain is dotted with 'revolutionary historical sites' and secret camps from which Kim Il Sung, North Korea's first president, is said to have led guerrilla attacks against the Japanese, who held the Korean Peninsula as a colony until their 1945 surrender ended World War II. Tens of thousands of North Koreans visit the mountain for political indoctrination tours each year during the summer months, when the snows have melted enough for it to be accessible. North Korea is also hoping to develop the volcano, which has a crystal blue crater lake, for foreign tourism. Fears that the 2,800-meter-tall (9,200-foot) volcano might be unstable began to grow in 2002, when increased seismic activity and ground swelling suggested the magma below the volcano was shifting. That activity subsided in 2006. Though not seen as a serious possibility by most experts, concerns were raised in South Korea and Japan that nuclear tests in the North — conducted at a site which is less than 100 kilometers away — might trigger an eruption. 'That activity sparked a lot of interest both in China and the DPRK, but also in Japan and South Korea and internationally,' said Oppenheimer's colleague James Hammond, a seismologist at Imperial College in London. He added that fears of another major eruption soon are probably unfounded. 'It's certainly very tranquil at the moment.' Even so, Hammond said the activity prompted the North Korean government to reach out to the international scientific community for help in understanding Paektu's inner workings. Until the 2002 activity, little scientific research on the volcano had been conducted in China or North Korea. Analysis: James Hammond, right, a seismologist at Imperial College in London, collects data from a seismometer on Mount Paektu . The project got underway in 2011 at the request of a North Korean government agency, the Pyongyang International Information Center on New Technology and Economy. With funding from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in Washington, D.C., that supports the sciences, . Oppenheimer and Hammond became the first Westerners to visit the North's six field stations on the volcano. Hammond said that although he was intrigued by the opportunity, the project was a logistical challenge, and not just because of language differences and North Korea's unfamiliarity in dealing with foreign researchers. International sanctions on the North over its nuclear weapons program made it difficult for the scientists to bring in some of the equipment they wanted because of concerns they could have dual use applications that might benefit the North's military. 'If we want to understand what the volcano is like today, we need to park instruments on the ground,' Hammond said. 'Building the models of what happened previously allows us to address what might happen in the future.' Politically sensitive: Paektu is considered sacred ground in both China and in North Korea, where it is seen as a symbol of the ruling Kim family and of the revolution that led to the founding of the country. Pictured is the current ruler - Kim Jong-Un . Friendly: Hammond said that the North Koreans had been professional and co-operative . He said that the North Korean side has been cooperative and highly professional. Hammond said that with their first year of data now complete, the scientists are hoping to begin the next stage of studying the data and samples in the laboratory and publishing papers on their findings with their North Korean colleagues early next year. In September last year, Hammond installed six broadband seismometers to record activity on the volcano, while North Korea's Korean Earthquake Bureau built protective huts for the equipment. He also collected samples of pumice that could provide insight into the scale of the millennium eruption, which is believed to have occurred between 930 and 940 A.D. Hammond said their next trip is scheduled for next year and he hopes the project will continue beyond that. He also hopes to host North Korean researchers for training and joint research in the U.K. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","UK scientists are the first Westerners to study Mount Paektu in North Korea .

"The lavish spending in the Premier League has been laid bare after the transfer window closed with clubs spending £858m — more than was splashed out in Spain’s La Liga (£425m), Italy’s Serie A (£260m) and France’s Ligue 1 (£100m) combined. Even Germany’s finest could not compete, with Premier League clubs’ outlay three times higher than the Bundesliga’s spending of £250m plus another £100m. Much of the money comes from huge TV deals in England and allow even a middling Premier League club to splash out more than the vast majority of foreign clubs on fees and wages. Here Sportsmail analyses how the money was spent ... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Premier League breaks records across the board . Am I worth it? Angel di Maria was the most expensive acquisition after joining United for a record £59.7m . Hey, big spenders! Premier League clubs spent £857.68m on transfers, with £520.83 of that going overseas . VIDEO Premier League breaks records across the board . MORE FOREIGN SIGNINGS THAN DOMESTIC DEALS . Of the total summer spending, Premier League clubs forked out £520.8m on players from overseas clubs (outside England, Scotland and Wales). Spending on those from British clubs (£336.9m) was just 39 per cent of the total. Spanish clubs collectively received £239.1m for 15 players, including Angel di Maria (£59.7m), while other big recipients were Portugal, France and Holland.

Chelsea have done the best value business by a country mile in pure finance terms, making a slight profit while improving. And Leicester and Southampton also do well on pure value (better or similar squad strength for a small outlay or profit).

"Letters slain journalist Steven Sotloff wrote to his family before he was beheaded by Islamic State militants were read at his memorial service on Friday, with him telling them to be happy and stay positive and that if they didn't meet again, he hoped they would in heaven. Several hundred mourners attended the service at Temple Beth Am in suburban Miami, including Senator Marco Rubio. He told the gathering that Mr Sotloff unmasked 'the nature of what we are dealing with' in final moments of his life. The service was arranged as quickly as possible, keeping with Jewish custom - even though Mr Sotloff's body is not there. Scroll down for video . Mourners embrace before entering a memorial service for freelance journalist Steven Sotloff at Temple Beth Am in Pinecrest, Florida on Friday.  The 31-year-old was shown being beheaded by an ISIS militant in a video posted online on Tuesday . Mourners, including Senator Marco Rubio, gathered in their hundreds today, to bid farewell to journalist Steven Sotloff who was murdered by Islamic extremists after being taken hostage in Syria a year ago . Devastated mourners gathered at Temple Beth Am in suburban Miami. The state governor Rick Scott had ordered flags flown at half-mast for Steven Sotloff today . The U.S. State Department has offered no information on the possibilities of recovering the bodies of Steven Sotloff and fellow slain journalist James Foley. The State department would not comment when contacted by Mailonline today. There was heavy security at Friday's service, with officers stationed at the front gate and entrance of the building in Pinecrest. 'Our job is to help them grieve, and that's what we're here to do as a family,' the temple's executive director Robert Hersh said before the service for Mr Sotloff today. He said the family will sit shiva, the Jewish mourning period, Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Organisers distributed a sheet of paper with the lyrics to a song Mr Sotloff's sister, Lauren Sotloff, had chosen - 'Wish You Were Here' by Pink Floyd. Mr Sotloff attended the temple school as a child, and his mother, Shirley Sotloff, teaches preschool there. Police officers stand at the front gates at a memorial service for U.S. freelance journalist Steven Sotloff . Mourners entered the memorial service on Friday with flowers to remember the life of Steven Sotloff . Mr Sotloff, a 31-year-old who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines before he was captured in Syria a year ago, also was an Israeli citizen. That fact was not widely known before his death - in part because Israel's military censor apparently kept a lid on the story for his safety. Mr Sotloff was remembered by his loved ones as a journalist who wanted to give a voice to the weak and the suffering . His killers are not believed to have known about his background. Rabbi Solomon Schiff said on Friday that Sotloff was the grandson of Holocaust survivors who 'knew after their bitter experience that only education can change hearts'. Mr Sotloff was close to them, and developed an interest in social justice issues. He became fluent in Arabic, read passages of the Quran and 'felt the suffering of those who live under despotic dictatorships, which is why he wanted to tell their stories,' Rabbi Terry Bookman said. Mr Sotloff visited Israel in the summer of his freshman year of college at the University of Central Florida, and later decided to pursue a counterterrorism study program there, despite his family's fears, Shirley Sotloff said. 'Though aware of the danger, his confidence in the goodness that lies in each person's core helped him overcome his anxiety and fear,' Bookman said. Mr Sotloff's sister, dressed in black and wearing sunglasses, read a short letter she wrote for her brother. In it, she described how he was her best friend and how they could be happy together 'doing absolutely nothing.' 'You were the one who brought music into my life,' Lauren Sotloff said before burying her hands in her face in tears. A woman leaves in tears from the emotional memorial today where Mr Sotloff's letters to his family were read out to mourners . The 31-year-old was remembered as a man with a deep interest in social justice issues who wanted to give a voice to the voiceless . Steven Sotloff's mother Shirley appealed to the captors of her son to release him last month but her pleas went unanswered and he was brutally killed . She then played a recording of a song that reminded her of him: 'Wish You Were Here' by Pink Floyd. As the song played, many in the audience sang along. Mr Sotloff is one of two American journalists the Islamic State has held captive and beheaded for what militants called payback for more than 120 U.S. airstrikes on its assets in northern Iraq since August 8. Journalists James Foley and Mr Sotloff were two of what the State Department has described as 'a few' Americans still being held hostage by the group. The Islamic State also had threatened to kill a British man it is holding hostage. Before he died, Mr Sotloff managed to get two letters to his family, a cousin said. 'Everyone has two lives,' he wrote in one. 'The second one begins when you realise you only have one.' He urged his family to hug one another, eat dinner together and surround themselves with strong and wise people. The last letter was sent in May. Four months later he was killed.

Family spokesman Barak Barfi told reporters gathered outside the family's suburban Miami home that Sotloff 'tried to find good concealed in a world of darkness,' and to give voice to the weak and suffering in the Arab world.

"Lewis Hamilton is cock of the walk here in the Royal Park. Asked why Nico Rosberg wants to beat him so fervently, he swallowed his modesty and said with a smile: ‘It’s because I’m good looking, man. I’ve got the car. I’ve got the girlfriend. What can I say?’ So we can safely assert that the rivalry between the two title contenders has not abated. While some of us wish our British hero would act with a touch more humility, it is probably hypocritical of us to decry him entirely for his boastfulness. For the sniping, moaning and crashing are precisely the reasons why so many eyes will be glued to the action when the lights go out at 1pm BST on Sunday. We await to see whether the two Mercedes men will come together. Will either give an inch to the other? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton preview this weekends Italian Grand Prix . Life in the fast lane: Lewis Hamilton, in the Mercedes garage on Friday, could consider a move back to McLaren . Catch-up: Hamilton, in action during Friday practice, is 29 points adrift of Nico Rosberg in the drivers' standings . Hamilton does not sound as if he will. ‘I guess I just keep on doing what I am doing,’ he said. ‘I feel it’s important for me not to change. They have hired me to win the championship. They have hired me to get them as many points as possible and to bring the car home, and I have generally been doing that every race.’ The mood of the two men is markedly different. Rosberg seems cowed by the public humiliation of being fined by his team and saying sorry like a stuck record for crashing into Hamilton at Spa a fortnight ago. In Germany he has been working on transforming his image from ‘Britney’ — as in Spears — into a fully grown man. He was winning fans as a result. But, according to observers in his homeland, his seemingly timid acceptance of Mercedes’ harsh censure has spoiled all that. Eyes on the prize: Rosberg is now the favourite for this year's title after extending his lead over Hamilton . Spa break: The two drivers came together in Belgium, Rosberg admitted the crash was his error . I am not convinced that verdict on his personality is accurate. Yes, it is Rosberg’s style not to engage in public slanging matches, but he has a hard core. His approach now is to close his ears to controversy and focus totally on the only important task: winning the title. Hamilton is different. He needs to feel the love of the team. Since Spa he has received it in spades, hence his jaunty air. One colleague from his McLaren days noted that Hamilton’s truculence and status as undeniably the biggest star in the sport causes his bosses to court his favour. It may sound like an odd phenomenon that grown men with big bank balances need the same affirmation as young drivers, but many of them do. Martin Whitmarsh, Hamilton’s old McLaren boss, could hardly see a driver without planting his palms all over his back. Picture perfect: Hamilton with his popstar girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger at the GQ Awards earlier this week . Drivers' standings: Rosberg is currently leading the championship, while team-mate Hamilton is second . 1 Nico Rosberg (Ger) Mercedes 220 pts . 2 Lewis Hamilton (GB) Mercedes 191 pts . 3 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Red Bull 156 pts . 4 Fernando Alonso (Spa) Ferrari 121 pts . 5 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Williams 110 pts . 6 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Red Bull 98 pts . 7 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Force India 70 pts . 8 Jenson Button (GB) McLaren 68 pts . Hamilton’s moodiness makes him harder to woo. So they try harder. That is probably why Whitmarsh did not discipline Hamilton when he posted his then team-mate Jenson Button’s telemetry on Twitter in 2012. It may explain why Mercedes did not act when he revealed what Rosberg said in a private meeting after the Spa crash. Rosberg, more serene and balanced, is lower maintenance and does not need the same level of indulgence. The question of which driver is favoured by Mercedes is not a simple one. The team are somewhat divided. The Mercedes board began the team with the avowed intent of running a German national team. That is why their first driver line-up was Michael Schumacher and Rosberg. That did not deliver success, so Niki Lauda was drafted in to carry out a review. He signed Hamilton to much fanfare, telling the board that this man could win the title for them. Lauda remains a Hamilton devotee; many at Stuttgart, the Mercedes headquarters, hold on to the notion of a German super-team, so Rosberg is their man. Then there is the team at Brackley, Northamptonshire. They are virtually all British, so we can assume that most of them favour their compatriot. The growing feeling in Monza is that if Hamilton loses the title to Rosberg he will leave. His contract talks are on hold and are only due to resume once the season is over. If Hamilton fails to win the title, the Mercedes board will have no need for him. A German winner in a German car would obviate the need for Hamilton. Escape route: Hamilton could return to McLaren, the team he started his grand prix career with . McLaren are ready to offer him an escape route. They and Honda, their engine partners of next season, want a marquee signing to end a period of decline at the team. Button, who is 34 and thought by the McLaren hierarchy to be small fractions short of fast enough, could well make way. But Hamilton is still fighting to win the title. If he does, he will almost certainly stay at Mercedes and have the advantage of driving a quick car again. His preparations for tomorrow’s race, where he will try to claw back some of his 29-point deficit to Rosberg, were hindered yesterday when he missed an hour of the second practice session with an electrical problem. He was fastest in the morning, Rosberg fastest in the afternoon. ‘I’ll try to understand what Nico learned in his session and I’ll try to learn that through data,’ said Hamilton of his missed mileage. ‘The team generally works together. When one car moves forward so does the team. It’s always difficult but I’m quite relaxed about it because it’s not the first time I’ve been in this situation, so I feel I’m able to deal with it.’","McLaren are ready to offer Hamilton an escape route from Mercedes .

"Algeria have suspended all football this weekend in memory of Albert Ebosse, the striker killed on Saturday after being struck by an object thrown from the crowd during a Ligue 1 match in the north African country. The Algerian Football Federation said in a statement it was considering several punitive measures, including potentially expelling Ebosse's club JS Kabylie from all competitions, but did not specify a time period. The Cameroon forward was struck on the head by an object allegedly thrown from a section of his club's own fans as the players left the field at the end of a 2-1 defeat to USM Alger in Tizi Ouzou, a match in which he had scored his side's only goal. In memory: The weekend's games have been called off in Algeria after the death of Cameroon striker Albert Ebosse, who was killed by an object thrown from stands of his club JS Kabylie's home ground . JS Kabylie confirmed in a statement posted on the club's website that Ebosse had passed away in hospital later on Saturday. The federation said the decision to cancel all matches this weekend was also to protest 'the irresponsible action of fanatics and hooligans who perpetuate violence in stadiums which has reached unacceptable proportions'. The federation and JS Kabylie said it had given an immediate sum of $100,000 to Ebosse's family and would ensure they were paid out the remainder of his contract. The 24-year-old Ebosse was the leading scorer in the Algerian league in the 2013-14 season with 17 goals having played the previous season in Malaysia. Reacting to the news of Ebosse's death, USM Alger published a statement on their own club website. 'JS Kabylie's Cameroonian striker has lost his life after being hit in the head by something launched from the stands. 'This terrible news is saddening for football in our nation and in Cameroon and arrives like a bombshell just hours after the meeting with USM Alger which was played (on Saturday) in Tizi Ouzou. 'In these painful circumstances, USM Alger and its members send their deepest condolences to the family of the deceased and to JS Kabylie. May Albert Ebosse rest in peace.'

"They have become the rallying cry for Ferguson protesters across the world. But the words, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', may never actually have  been said by Michael Brown, according to witness accounts contained in thousands of grand jury documents. Similarly, the unarmed black 18-year-old's hands might not have been raised in the air when he was shot dead by white officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9. The accounts, released by prosecutors earlier this week and reviewed by the Associated Press, feature a number of variations as to the position of Brown's hands at the time of the fatal shooting. Scroll down for video . Rallying cry: They have become the rallying cry for protesters across the world. But the words, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', may never actually have been said by Michael Brown, according to newly-seen witness accounts . Shooting: Similarly, the unarmed black 18-year-old's (right) hands might not have been raised in the air when he was shot dead by white officer Darren Wilson (left) in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb of Ferguson on August 9 . While some witnesses claim he knelt on the ground, raised his hands and shouted, 'Don't shoot!', before he was gunned down by Wilson, others insist he was stood up with his arms by his sides. For those who believe his hands were raised, some think they were pointed toward the sky, others claim were partially raised and several believe his palms appeared out, as if he was surrendering. And to a number, Brown's palms seemed open, as if he was glancing at his wounded hand or gesturing with an attitude of 'What are you going to do about it?' The contradictory accounts arguably undermine the  'Hands up, don't shoot!' cry, now a national symbol of racial inequality for those who believe overzealous police target minorities too often. However, some argue it does not matter whether Brown's hands were literally raised in the air - nor whether he yelled, 'Hands up, don't shoot!' - because his death symbolizes a bigger movement. 'This is not about one boy getting shot in the street, but about the hundreds just like him who have received the same callous and racially-influenced treatment,' protester, Gabe Johnson, a middle school teacher from Oakland, California, said. Chanting: The accounts feature a number of variations as to the position of Brown's hands at the time of the shooting. Above, protesters chant, 'Hands up, don't shoot' outside Washington DC's National Portrait Gallery . Demonstrating: A female protester places her head through a hole in a poster showing a pair of raised hands . 'So ultimately, no, it doesn’t matter at all if somehow we can say for sure whether this one young man really said these words or had his hands up.' Demonstrator James Cox, 28, a food server, also from Oakland, added: 'He wasn't shot because of the placement of his hands; he was shot because he was a big, black, scary man.' Following the announcement of the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson in the case on Monday, protesters have been taking to the streets of more than 170 U.S. cities in demonstration. 1. Michael Brown knelt on the ground, raised his hands and shouted, 'Don't shoot!', before he was gunned down by Darren Wilson. 2. The unarmed 18-year-old's hands were pointed toward the sky . 3. His hands were only partially raised . 4. Brown's palms appeared out, as if he was surrendering to Wilson . 5. His palms seemed open, as if he was glancing at his wounded hand or gesturing with an attitude of 'What are you going to do about it?' 6. Brown was stood up with his arms by his sides - not raised - when he was shot dead . Every night so far, thousands of people - from Los Angeles to New York to London - have raised their arms in the air and chanted: 'Hands up, don't shoot!' Some have carried hand-made banners featuring the same words, others have held posters reading: 'Black lives matter' and hundreds have accused the police of 'brutality'. The shooting has had particular resonance in London, which was rocked by days of rioting after the 2011 death of Mark Duggan, a young black man shot dead by police under disputed circumstances. Meanwhile, in Ferguson, some protesters have even been donning shirts printed with the phrase, 'Hands up, don't shoot!', as they demonstrate outside the suburb's police station. The truth behind the words may never be certain. Despite a state investigation and an ongoing federal probe, no one has publicly disclosed any photos or videos of exactly what transpired. Protester Taylor Gruenloh, a 32-year-old white man from nearby Florissant, said that while he believes there is truth to the claims that Brown had his hands raised when shot, the lack of proof makes little difference to demonstrators who have found it to be a unifying force. 'Even if you don't find that it's true, it's a valid rallying cry,' he said. 'It's just a metaphor.' Meanwhile, architect Evan Chakroff, who was this week protesting in Seattle, claimed the 'Hands up' gesture is far from a literal representation of the circumstances of Brown's death. Incident: Brown had been walking with a friend down the center of Canfield Drive when Wilson, passing in his patrol vehicle, told them to move to the sidewalk. The pair then had a scuffle at Wilson's car (pictured) Broken glass: In subsequent seconds, Wilson fired a shot that hit Brown in the right hand. When the teen ran, Wilson gave chase, before later opening fire. Above, broken glass from Wilson's patrol car window . Weapon: This gun, used to kill Brown, was also released as part of the dump of grand jury evidence . 'My sense is that it's totally symbolic and a way of representing powerlessness' in the face of inequality and militarized police, he said. Brown had been walking with a friend down the center of Canfield Drive on August 9 when Wilson, passing in his patrol vehicle, told them to move to the sidewalk. After they refused to do so, Wilson reportedly realized Brown was a robbery suspect, at which point a scuffle broke out at the window of his vehicle. In subsequent seconds, Wilson fired a shot that hit Brown in the right hand. When the teenager ran, Wilson gave chase. At some point, Brown stopped and turned toward Wilson, who opened fire. Wilson told the grand jury that Brown had his left hand in a fist at his side and his right hand under his shirt at his waist, and was charging toward him, when he gunned him down. 'If only America cared about black lives': Protesters Amy Schyler, (left) of Milwaukee and Deborah Krause, (right), of Webster Groves, listen to a speech before demonstrating in the Galleria Mall on Black Friday . Some of the witness accounts of the high-profile shooting differed so much that they did not seem like the same scene. Above, protesters lie outside a Ferguson mall on Saturday in protest at the grand jury's verdict . In the grand jury documents, the phrase 'hands up' is peppered as prosecutors and investigators desperately tried to clarify exactly what witnesses saw. In quite a few cases, it is unclear precisely what onlookers say they saw because the gestures they made for grand jurors were not described in the transcripts. Alarmingly, some of the witness accounts of the high-profile shooting differed so much that they did not seem like the same scene. 'I saw him in the middle of the street on his knees with hands up,' one witness said. '[The] officer came up to him and shot him in his head and he fell.' But another witness was insistent that Brown was on his feet at the time and did not raise his hands. 'The officer was already in pursuit of him,' they said. 'He stopped. He did turn, he did some sort of body gesture, I'm not sure what it was, but I know it was a body gesture. 'And I could say for sure he never put his hands up after he did his body gesture, he ran towards the officer full charge.' According to experts, the disputed circumstances of Brown's death highlight the inherent troubles with the use of eyewitness testimony in court. 'It's difficult for people under the best of circumstances to accurately report what happened,' said Elizabeth Brondolo, a psychology professor specializing in race at St. John's University in New York. For Wilson and others at the shooting scene, what they say they saw may depend not just on their vantage point, but also their view of life, she said. 'The truth always really matters, but it's important to recognize that past experience to stereotypes also influences the perception of hands being raised,' she said.","'Hands up, don't shoot!' has become rallying cry for Ferguson protesters .
But words may not have been said by unarmed Brown, testimonies show .

"Austrian striker Atdhe Nuhiu struck a 78th-minute penalty as  Championship side Sheffield Wednesday stunned Premier League newboys Burnley 1-0 in the Capital One cup. Substitute Nuhiu rifled home to settle the second-round tie at a half-empty Turf Moor after Jason Shackell had upended Jeremy Helan. The Clarets had been in the ascendancy at the time but the contest overall was fairly even and the Owls had gone close when Burnley's Kevin Long struck the frame of his own goal. Cool as you like: Substitute Atdhe Nuhiu scores from the penalty spot to put Sheffield Wednesday in front . Spot on: Nuhiu celebrates his goal that sent Wednesday through at the expense of Premier League Burnley . Burnley: Gilks, Trippier, Long, Shackell, Ward, Kightly (Ings 82), Jones (Taylor 60), Arfield, Wallace, Sordell (Jutkiewicz 83), Barnes. Subs not used: Heaton, Duff, Reid, Mee. Sheffield Wednesday: Kirkland, Mattock, Semedo, Palmer, Lees, Zayatte, Coke, Helan, Maghoma (May 63'), Madine, Maguire (Nuhiu 73). Subs not used: Westwood, Loovens, McCabe, Corry, Floro, . Booked: Maguire, Coke . Goals: Nuhiu 78 . Referee: Geoff Eltringham . Att: 4,979 . Burnley wanted a penalty themselves in injury time when Ashley Barnes went down but nothing was given. The final whistle was greeted by a roar from the away fans, who had made the most noise all night with many Burnley supporters having decided to stay away. The match, coming between home Premier League games against Chelsea and Manchester United, was always likely to be a hard sell for the home club. While a packed Turf Moor was rocking last Monday, the top tiers of two stands were empty on this occasion and there were plenty more vacant seats in an echoey atmosphere. That seemed to have an effect on the pace of the game, as did the seven changes made by Burnley boss Sean Dyche, whose alterations included debuts for summer signings Matt Gilks and Stephen Ward. Opposite number Stuart Gray - who had a brief spell in caretaker charge of the Clarets almost four years ago - included former England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland among his four changes. Full-blooded: Both teams put in a committed performance but it was Wednesday who ran out winners . Opposite number Stuart Gray - who had a brief spell in caretaker charge of the Clarets almost four years ago - included former England goalkeeper Chris Kirkland among his four changes. Michael Kightly should have given Burnley an early lead but mis-kicked in front of goal before former Hull defender Kamil Zayatte poked wide at the opposite end. Wednesday spurned another good opportunity when Gary Madine headed narrowly over from a Chris Maguire corner. Burnley and Long then had a major let-off when the defender slid in to cut out a Maguire cross and turned the ball against his own woodwork for what was almost a spectacular own goal. Going in where it hurts: Sheffield Wednesday's Kamil Zayatte  gets there first in Tuesday's clash at Turf Moor . After that the Clarets began to settle and dominate possession. Ross Wallace, who earlier shot at Kirkland from distance, had a free-kick deflected over. Barnes should have done better when picked out by Wallace but headed wide from in front of goal. Scott Arfield had a speculative effort from a free-kick inside the centre circle but Kirkland saved comfortably enough. Gilks might have been extended before the break after a Jeremy Helan run but a deflection took the pace out of his shot. Composed: David Jones starts an attack for Burnley in the Capital One cup clash on Tuesday . Burnley tried to up the tempo after the restart with Barnes testing Kirkland and Marvin Sordell shooting over on the turn. Wednesday enjoyed a good spell with Madine heading at Gilks and Maguire shooting into the side-netting. But chances started to open up for Burnley as substitute Matt Taylor shot wide after a goalmouth scramble and Barnes missed the target with a header. It came against the run of play when Wednesday got their penalty as Shackell fouled Helan on the right of the area. Nuhiu fired straight down the middle for his third goal in two games as Gilks dived to his right. Burnley produced a late flurry but not enough to trouble Kirkland.","Championship side Sheffield Wednesday stun Premier League Burnley at Turf Moor .

"When Arsenal signed Danny Welbeck on transfer deadline day it was seen by many as a decent stop-gap until Olivier Giroud returns from injury. The French striker will be back come the New Year and Arsene Wenger was in desperate need of cover. But in the long run, with Theo Walcott soon to return to action, Welbeck's arrival could mean a significant change of style for Arsenal. A front three of the former Manchester United forward, Walcott and summer signing Alexis Sanchez is on the cards. And it could be the quickest front three in the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down for Danny Welbeck: I've envisaged myself playing for Arsenal before . The shirt fits: Danny Welbeck in his new shirt after the Arsenal agreed a £16m deal with Manchester United . Speedster: Welbeck could link up with new £30m signing Alexis Sanchez on the wing . On the mend: Theo Walcott could be part of a frightening front three when he returns from injury . Options: Arsenal's probable line-up? In truth Wenger now has a wealth of attacking options. Welbeck joins Walcott, Sanchez, Yaya Sanogo, Joel Campbell and Lukas Podolski as men who can lead the line. And behind that there is even more choice. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil, Tomas Rosicky, Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey provide a wealth of possibility at the Emirates Stadium. A probable forward line, with all players available, of Welbeck, Walcott and Sanchez will mean a move away from that measured style for Wenger. Of course, the passing football will remain in tact, but the slow build-up and lack of penetration should be long gone. Arsenal badly missed Walcott after his injury in January, without any players running in behind Giroud. Wenger has tinkered with a 4-5-1 formation this season to get the best out of Ramsey and Wilshere, though the 4-3-3 will best suit this team. A flavour of Arsenal's 2003/04 counter attack could be back on the cards, with Ozil able to thread through balls through to the raft of speedsters. 'I believe the style of play the manager's got and the boys play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through, I can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away,' Welbeck said upon arriving at the club. Bench life: Welbeck will be given more chance to impress in his favourite central role at Arsenal . Time to create: Mesut Ozil will have plenty of runners to thread through this season in the Premier League . Often played on the wing and out of the goals at United and for England, the 23-year-old now has his chance. And with the players around him, there should be no excuse. Welbeck's speed and power coupled with Sanchez and Walcott is a mouth-watering prospect, so watch out Premier League.","Welbeck sealed £16m move from Manchester United on deadline day .

"A Saudi prince who murdered a fellow Saudi may be executed, a newspaper reported on Sunday, in a rare example of a member of the kingdom's ruling family facing the death penalty. The English-language Arab News did not name the prince or his victim, but said a senior member of the family and government, Crown Prince Salman, had ‘cleared the way for the possible execution of a prince convicted of murdering a Saudi citizen’. In a message about the case to Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Prince Salman said: ‘Sharia (Islamic law) shall be applied to all without exception’, the daily reported. Scroll down for video . Ruling: Crown Prince Salman has said that no one is immune from Sharia law . Prince Salman's message followed a statement from the victim's father that he was not ready to pardon the killer and he was not happy with the amount offered as blood money. The families of murder victims are encouraged by authorities to accept blood money instead of insisting on execution. The paper quoted Crown Prince Salman's message as saying: ‘There is no difference between big and small, rich and poor ... Nobody is allowed to interfere with the judiciary's decision. This is the tradition of this state. We are committed to following the sharia.’ Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was told to clear the way for an execution of the royal . An Interior Ministry spokesman was approached by Reuters for a comment, but no one was available at the time of writing. The Arab News is part of a media group chaired by a son of Crown Prince Salman, who is also deputy prime minister and minister of defence. The kingdom, which follows a strict version of sharia has been criticised in the West for its high number of executions, inconsistencies in the application of the law, and its use of public beheading to carry out death sentences. Saudi Arabia had executed at least 47 people as of May 2013, according to Amnesty International's website, compared to 82 in all of 2011 and a similar number in 2012. Members of the ruling family are only rarely known to be executed. One of the most prominent cases was Faisal bin Musaid al Saud, who assassinated his uncle, King Faisal, in 1975. The family is estimated to number several thousand. While members receive monthly stipends, and the most senior princes command great wealth and political power, only a few in the family hold nationally important government posts.","So far, the identity of the prince and his victim has not been made public .

"A deadly albino cobra that ran loose for days in a Southern California neighborhood was captured on Thursday. 'We are overjoyed. We are glad that the public was not harmed,' Los Angeles County spokesman Brandon Dowling said after county animal control officers nabbed the monocled cobra shortly after 3 p.m. Television reports showed officers using a long-handled tong-like grabber to haul the snake from a pile of scrap lumber in a backyard and put it in a long wooden box. It was taken to an animal shelter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Finally captured: This cobra was reported loose in Southern California on Monday when it attacked a dog . The snake didn't go quietly, though. 'Once we grabbed it, it was afraid of us so it tried to strike at us,' animal control officer Fred Agoopi said. 'But we had the proper equipment and were able to handle it.' Los Angeles County handles animal control duties for this Ventura County town. The venom of the cobra is a neurotoxin that can kill within an hour. However, it wasn't immediately clear whether the albino snake — which apparently escaped from captivity — still had its venom glands, authorities said. The snake, which is several feet long, had been on the loose since at least Monday evening, when it reportedly bit a dog. However, the veterinarian who treated the animal said it appeared that the dog wasn't bitten but was hurt while trying to escape the snake, KNBC-TV reported. Struggle: Officers finally captured the cobra and struggled to get it to go into a box . First try: They tried to push the cobra into the box but little did the know it would try to escape . Great escape: the cobra managed to slither outside of the box until it was finally contained . County animal control officers and state wildlife officials poked through bushes and checked woodpiles, concentrating their searches during cooler morning and evening hours when the snake was more likely to be up and around. There were no more confirmed sightings of the snake until Thursday afternoon, when it was seen slithering in the same Rancho Lane area where it originally was spotted. Tanya Gray saw it crossing the road. She kept an eye on it but didn't approach. 'It wasn't my job to stop it or catch it,' she told KCAL-TV. 'It was just shocking because I didn't think I'd be the one to find it,' a youngster, Simona Lucchina, told KABC-TV. 'We were just driving by and my dad was showing me 'this is where they lost the snake' and all of the sudden we just saw it. It was a big coincidence.' Before the snake was captured, authorities had warned residents to keep an eye on their children, to keep pets indoors and to call 911 if they spotted it. Success: Officer Manuel Gonzales, left, and Lt. Fred Agoopi, from the Los Angeles County Animal Care & Control, carry a snake box that contains the captured venomous albino monocled cobra . Determined: Lt. Fred Agoopi, right, from the Los Angeles County Animal Care & Control, captures a venomous albino monocled cobra . Those who live in the neighborhood, which is surrounded by snake-friendly brush and wilderness areas, weren't panicked by the intruder. 'I think we're all a bit concerned, but growing up in an area where there are rattlesnakes, it's probably not quite as scary,' said Susan McGrath, who lives several doors away from where the dog reportedly was bitten. However, the cobra became a mini-media sensation and at least three Twitter accounts were started in its name. One, AlbinoMonocledCobra, had nearly 250 followers by Thursday afternoon. After the capture, AlbinoMonocledCobra tweeted: 'It's over, folks. #SendBail$$$.' It also most recently tweeted, 'For the record, NO ONE has read my Miranda rights to me. Apparently, snakes aren't considered citizens. Somebody better tell #Hannity.' Twitter users also took to the social media site to start their own 'Free Whitey' campaign to free their slithery friend from captivity. The monocled cobra is native to Southeast Asia, parts of India and China, and it can grow to 4 feet or more. Its name derives from a circle or ring on the back of its hood. Cobras are illegal to own in California except for educational and scientific purposes, and a permit is required. The cobra apparently escaped from captivity, although authorities had not found the owner. Dowling said Thursday that investigators are following 'a few leads' on where the snake came from.

"A masked child has 're-enacted' James Foley's murder in disturbing images which show the youngster beheading a doll in an orange jumpsuit. The photos were posted online by a supporter of the Islamic State terror group and came with the chilling message: 'Teach your children to cut necks, tomorrow there will be a lot of rotten heads'. Along with the photographs, which also show the doll after it has been beheaded, the Time for the Caliphate account circulated graphic images of the U.S. journalist's murder to its 3,500 followers. It comes amid growing concerns over disaffected or vulnerable children being radicalised through social media as major networks including Twitter and Youtube vow to halt the spread of extremist propaganda. Chilling: Barefoot and wearing a black balaclava, a young child appears to re-enact the brutal murder of the U.S. journalist James Foley by beheading a doll in an orange jumpsuit. The images were circulated on Twitter . Propaganda: A second image shows the doll decapitated and smeared with what appears to be fake blood . The sick child 'execution' images mirrored the murder of James Foley, with the unknown child holding a knife and dressed all in black including a balaclava. In the main image, the child holds the blond doll by its hair while standing in front of the black flag which has become the symbol of the terror group. In the second, the doll is decapitated on the floor. For some, the photographs add to concerns that children are being radicalised with the help of the persuasive power of social media. Earlier this month Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott voiced condemnation after images circulated of a young boy - allegedly the son of an Australian ex-terror convict - apparently holding a severed Syrian man's head. British jihadists have been using teenagers' everyday communication tools, including smartphone apps and the question-and-answer website ask.fm, to persuade impressionable children as young as 15 to join them. Former student Reyaad Khan, 20, from Cardiff, made headlines when he appeared in a recruitment video for the Islamic State. His case particularly concerned observers as he was remembered by most school friends as a talented scholar who until recently held moderate views and mixed with people from all backgrounds. He once said he wanted to be Britain's first Asian Prime Minister. Threats: The message next to one of the images read: 'Teach your children to cut necks, tomorrow there will be a lot of rotten heads'. It comes amid fears over young people being radicalised through social media . Propaganda: Islamic State militants have swept through Iraq and Syria and spread fear through social media . Professor Nicholas O'Shaughnessy from Queen Mary University of London, who has studied Islamist communications and wrote Politics and Propaganda: Weapons of Mass Seduction, told MailOnline he believed the images were not aimed to corrupt children in themselves. But he said: 'The . images involve a child and therefore deliberately invoke the idea of . contaminating the innocence of children. 'They are a way of exploiting . the original death imagery in a new, creative and utterly foul manner.' 'It is so utterly sick and perverted and depraved that it guarantees global visibility: child abuse, pure and simple' - Professor Nicholas O'Shaugnessy . He added: 'It is so utterly sick and perverted and depraved that it guarantees global visibility: child abuse, pure and simple, it pushes other stuff to one side in a world where so much else is competing for our attention. 'The interesting question is why. This practice is so deeply alientating and it is founded in a belief in the supreme effectiveness of the fear appeal, forgetting of course that there are stronger motives than fear. 'Anger, for example, assassinates every other emotion and all ISIS are really doing is arousing universal rage against them such that we no longer see ISIS as human, but monsters to be slain, or cockroaches to be stamped on.' The photographs were posted on Friday after Twitter and Youtube vowed to launch a renewed crackdown on jihadi propaganda accounts. Several accounts circulating gruesome imagery were taken down almost as soon as they were launched, with jihadis switching to other less well-known social networks. Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo wrote on Wednesday: 'We have been and are actively suspending accounts as we discover them related to this graphic imagery. Thank you.' Some accounts, however, continued to gain followers and spread messages of hate. The Time for the Caliphate account was founded almost three years ago and showed no signs of halting its messages. Respected: U.S. journalist Foley was abducted in Syria in 2012 and fell into the hands of the terrorist group . It also received several messages of support in Arabic from other Islamic State supporters, thanking militants for 'defeating these traitors and tyrants' and putting 'terror into the hearts of the infidels'. It also received several messages of support in Arabic from other Islamic State supporters, thanking militants for 'defeating these traitors and tyrants' and putting 'terror into the hearts of the infidels'. Posting a photo of second U.S. journalist Steven Joel Sotloff - who appeared to be threatened in the slick execution video - the account used the hashtag #StevensHeadinObamasHands. On another still from the James Foley murder video, the account insisted that he was 'armed to the teeth and trying to corrupt the media'. That was despite a second image being posted of the aftermath of the murder, with the stark message: 'We will cut off your head, O soldiers of Satan like this.' A Twitter spokesman told MailOnline: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons.' Islamic State militants have swept through large regions of Iraq and Syria pledging to establish a 'Caliphate' which would enact a harsh interpretation of Sharia law. Extremists have hunted down religious minorities, from Christians to Shia Muslims and the little-known Yazidi group, and taken entire towns killing thousands of people.","Images posted by Twitter account Time of the Caliphate to 3,500 followers .

"An American Airlines flight was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing after cracks formed in the cockpit’s windscreen shortly after take-off. There were anxious moments for some passengers when the twin-engine plane, carrying almost 200 people, returned to Los Angeles International Airport while en route to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Monday. After the aircraft landed safely, passenger Glenn Kagan snapped a photograph that shows a spider web of cracks in the left windscreen of the Boeing 757-223. Emergency: The American Airlines flight turned around after cracks formed in the windscreen . Mark Denesuk, a fellow passenger, told NBC affiliate KXAS-TV that the pilot made an announcement about the cracked windscreen about 20 minutes into the flight. He said: ‘The captain said in all his years of flying, he had never seen anything like it and that the safest thing to do was to turn around and go back to LA.’ Passenger Arthur Underman praised the professionalism of the crew, saying: ‘The captain and the crew were incredible.

"Arsene Wenger has revealed he will be on 'alert until the last minute' as pressure mounts on the Arsenal boss to sign a replacement for Olivier Giroud before the transfer window closes. Giroud has been ruled out until next year with a broken foot which he sustained in Arsenal's 2-2 draw at Everton last Saturday. But while Wenger, who was speaking ahead of his side's match against Leicester on Sunday, didn't rule out movement in the market, he also hinted that he may not add to his squad before the deadline of 11pm on Monday. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wenger say he will be actively involved on transfer deadline day . In the stands: Arsene Wenger was at the Emirates Stadium on Thursday night to watch the Under 21s . 'Of course we can be successful. Why not? The success of the season does not depend on one player that you buy or not,' Wenger said. 'If I give you the number of strikers we have at the moment, it's absolutely unbelievable. We have Yaya Sanogo, Alexis Sanchez, Theo Walcott and Lukas Podolski. 'Giroud will be back during the season and Joel Campbell can play centre-forward as well. 'You sign players when you think it strengthens your squad. If you find the right player, then you want to do it. 'We've shown in the last two seasons that when we think money has to be spent, we do it. But we want to do it in the right way. 'I will be on alert until the last minute of the transfer deadline.' In action: Joel Campbell played in Arsenal Under 21s' 4-2 win over West Brom on Thursday night . Injury blow: Olivier Giroud has been ruled out until next year with a broken foot sustained at Everton . Former England striker Gary Lineker stated on Thursday that Arsenal must add firepower if they are to win major silverware as £35million signing Sanchez, who started as the lone striker against Everton and Besiktas, is more suited a wider role. 'We live in a society of opinions,' Wenger said. 'People are better informed these days. Many of them are better informed than I am. But all of these opinions don't mean people are right. 'Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but that doesn't mean it's right. 'In fact, when opinions have been wrong in the past, people have never come out and say ""sorry I was wrong"" - the easiest thing is to have an opinion.' On target: Alexis Sanchez operated the lone striker role against Besiktas. He scored on the stroke of half-time . Wenger believes if any suitable targets become available, his experience of doing business on deadline day should prove helpful. Twelve months ago Mesut Ozil completed a late £42.4million move from Real Madrid and two years prior to that Mikel Arteta was among three players signed in a last-gasp flurry of deals. 'It's harder to buy top, top players because many clubs are on the market and everybody knows each other,' Wenger said. 'The last few days are poker games. There are a lot of lies there and everyone is interested in the same player, even if you're the only one who wants the player. 'Of course (having experience of operating late in the window helps). You can call it bluff when it's bluff.' Having qualified for the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday night, Arsenal resume their Premier League campaign at promoted Leicester on Sunday. Wenger recalls his visit to the Foxes in 1997 early in his Gunners reign when Dennis Bergkamp scored a hat-trick in a remarkable 3-3 draw. 'I remember the first sensational goal with Dennis Bergkamp. Many times I have said that that goal is one of the greatest goals I've seen in my career,' Wenger said. 'It was also my first experience with Ian Wright - he didn't understand why I took him off. 'I wanted to spare him some minutes at the end of the game, but Wright was always keen to play.'

"ISIS admitted Tuesday it released a video of a man being beheaded before it was supposed to, it has emerged. Vocativ reported that the video - which allegedly shows the killing of Steven Sotloff - was shared through a Twitter account. @Khattabyaz warned the first account there had been a mistake, and failed to stop the beheading video from being disseminated, the website reported. According to the news site, ISIS then wrote on Justpaste 'A clarification about the mistake was made by ""Uyun al-Ummah"" account, that has published the video before the official time. 'The user saw a tweet with the video and thought it was published officially. We tried to remove the video after we understood that his was published by mistake, and we are sorry to the followers of the Islamic State.' In a later Twitter message, those responsible apologized and asked fellow jihadis not to 'reproach' them. Scroll down for video . Beheading: ISIS released a video which allegedly showed the beheading of freelance journalist Steven Sotloff before it was supposed to. The group later apologized to its followers . Retaliation: The fighter who apparently beheads Sotloff in the video calls it retribution for Obama's continued airstrikes against the group . The video footage - depicting what the U.S. called a sickening act of brutality - was posted two weeks after the release of video showing the killing of James Foley and just days after Sotloff's mother pleaded for his life. In the video, the man who appears to be Sotloff says 'I am Steven Joel Sotloff. I'm sure you know exactly who I am by now and why I am appearing before you. And now this time for my message: . 'Obama, your foreign policy of intervention in Iraq was supposed to be for the preservation of American lives and interest. So why is it that I’m having to pay the price of your interference with my life? Am I not an American citizen? 'You’ve spent billions of U.S. taxpayers dollars and we’ve lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State. So where is the American people’s interest in reigniting this war? From what little I know about foreign policy I remember a time when you cannot win an election without promising to bring our troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to close down Guantanamo. 'Here you are now Obama nearing the end of your term and having achieved none of the above and seemingly marching us the American people into a blazing fire.' Barak Barfi, a spokesman for the family, said that the Sotloffs had seen the video but that authorities have not established its authenticity. 'The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately. There will be no public comment from the family during this difficult time,' Barfi said. Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished in Syria in August 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed Foley's beheading. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the Islamic State. In the video distributed Tuesday and titled 'A Second Message to America,' Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the Islamic State, the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq and declared itself a caliphate. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. intelligence analysts will work as quickly as possible to determine if the video is authentic. 'If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act, taking the life of another innocent American citizen,' Psaki said. 'Our hearts go out to the Sotloff family.' Psaki said it is believed that 'a few' Americans are still being held by the Islamic State. Psaki would not give any specifics, but one is a 26-year-old woman kidnapped while doing humanitarian aid work in Syria, according to a family representative who asked that the hostage not be identified out of fear for her safety. The fighter who apparently beheads Sotloff in the video calls it retribution for Obama's continued airstrikes against the group. 'I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the Islamic State ... despite our serious warnings,' the fighter says. 'So just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.' The killer specifically mentions the recent U.S. airstrikes around the Mosul dam and the beleaguered Iraqi town of Amirli, making it unlikely that Sotloff was killed at the same time as Foley, as some analysts had speculated. Over the weekend, Iraqi government forces with help from U.S. airstrikes broke the Islamic State's two-month siege of Amirli, a town where some 15,000 Shiite Turkmens had been stranded. The video footage - depicting what the U.S. called a sickening act of brutality - was posted two weeks after the release of video showing the killing of James Foley and just days after Sotloff's mother pleaded for his life . In a statement Tuesday evening from U.S. Central Command, military officials said an airstrike conducted Monday against Islamic State militants near the Mosul Dam damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles. The SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, first reported the video's existence. The Islamic State has terrorized rivals and civilians alike with widely publicized brutality as it seeks to expand a proto-state it has carved out on both sides of the border. In its rise to prominence over the past year, it has frequently published graphic photos and gruesome videos of bombings, beheadings and mass killings. Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded with his captors for mercy, saying in a video that her son was 'an innocent journalist' and 'an honorable man' who 'has always tried to help the weak.' Around the world: Sotloff is seen in Libya in this 2011 file photo . Mother: Shirley Sotloff pleaded with his captors for mercy last week, saying in a video that her son was 'an innocent journalist' and 'an honorable man' who 'has always tried to help the weak' Sotloff grew up in the Miami area, graduated from Kimball Union Academy, a prep school in New Hampshire, and then attended the University of Central Florida, which said he majored in journalism from 2002 to 2004 but apparently left without graduating. Just how Sotloff made his way from Florida to Middle East hotspots is not clear. He published articles from Syria, Egypt and Libya in a variety of publications. Several focus on the plight of ordinary people in war-torn places. In a statement, Foreign Policy magazine said it was saddened by news of his death and called him a 'brave and talented journalist' whose reporting 'showed a deep concern for the civilians caught in the middle of a brutal war.' Time Editor Nancy Gibbs said Sotloff 'gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world.' House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican, said the new video demonstrates the Islamic State's 'barbarity across the region - beheading and crucifying those who don't share their ideology.' He said the U.S. and allies need to step up military action against the group, including through airstrikes. At Sotloff's parents' home in Pinecrest, Florida., two police vehicles blocked the driveway Tuesday, and officers advised journalists to stay away. Friends of the family could be seen coming and going. 'Everyone's been concerned. Everyone is grieving,' neighbor Pepe Cazas said. 'It's terrible. I've been praying for him.'","ISIS admitted Tuesday it released a video of a beheading before it was supposed to .

"Attorney General Eric Holder has cited a 'history of mistrust' between officers and the residents of Ferguson, Missouri, as he announced a wide-ranging civil rights investigation of the entire police department in the wake of the shooting of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a white cop. Holder also said that the Justice Department is reviewing the conduct of the St. Louis County Police Department - and the inquiry could spread to other departments in the St. Louis area if investigators deem it necessary. Holder, who visited Ferguson last month as riots and protests flared up after 18-year-old Brown was gunned down by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9, said residents told him about a 'deep mistrust' between the overwhelmingly white police force and the majority black population of Ferguson. 'As a result of this history, and after of a review of documented allegations of incidents, we have determined that there's cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation of whether there is a pattern and practice of officers in Ferguson violating constitutional rights or federal laws,' Holder announced. Scroll down for video . Attorney General Eric Holder has launched a wide-ranging civil rights investigation into police practices in the St. Louis area . Brown's death sparked a national debate about police militarization after the police response to the protests over the teenager's death. Here, a SWAT team approaches a protester in Ferguson . The heavily-militarized Ferguson and St. Louis County police response to protests in the streets shocked the nation and served to further inflame racial tensions . In response . to the investigation, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson defended his . department - saying his officers have done an 'excellent job.' However, he conceded to NBC News: 'We can be better and we're willing to be.' Brown's . killing triggered massive protests in Ferguson and started a national . debate on race relations and the use of force by police. The . community's anger at the shooting resulted in massive protests and, in . some instances, vandalism and violence on the city streets. In response, . heavily-armed Ferguson and St. Louis County police in tactical gear . took to the streets with automatic weapons and armored military vehicles . in an attempt to restore order. The Justice Department investigation will . look at the practices in the past few years of the police department, . including patterns of stops, arrests and use of force, as well as the . training the officers receive. The investigation will focus on whether officers showed a pattern of discriminating against black residents,  the New York Times report. Holder has personally assured Brown's family that the Justice Department investigation will be 'thorough and independent,' according to the newspaper. The Attorney General and his staff decided to launch a wider investigation of police in the St. Louis area when claims came to light of a history of police abuse of power after Brown's death. Black community leaders say black residents endure a pattern of harassment and abuse at the hands of the mostly-white police force and claim Bown's shooting was just the most egregious example. Tension: After the response from Ferguson police sparked national outrage, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon appointed the State Highway Patrol (pictured) to oversee security on the streets . Police and protesters clashed most nights, with protesters throwing molotov cocktails, looting and vandalising . Michael Brown (left) was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson (right) in a confrontation on August 9 . The Justice Department's investigation will focus on  whether Ferguson police have shown a 'pattern or practice' of violating the constitutional or civil rights of residents. This will include an examination of the department's history of using force - including shootings. Federal investigators will also look at arrests traffic stop to determine whether officers have a history of habitually harassing or targeting residents. 'Pattern or practice' investigations are authorized under a 1994 law passed after the Los Angeles police beating of Rodney King, which was caught on video. Attorney General Eric Holder has opened 20 such investigations during his tenure - twice as many a were launched in the five years before he took over the Justice Department. Often, the investigations result in federal lawsuits and Justice Department oversight of local police departments. Recently, the Justice Department cracked down on the Albuquerque Police Department after finding officers repeatedly used force - including deadly force - open people who did not pose a risk to the community. Five . current officers on one former member of the Ferguson police department . are the subject of lawsuits alleging excessive force. There are at . least six other internal investigations of excessive force ongoing, the Washington Post reports. The . investigations include claims that officers hog-tied a 12-year-old boy . who was checking his family's mailbox, pistol-whipped multiple children . and Tasered a mentally-ill man who later died in police custody. One man said he was brutally beaten by officers in 2009 and then charged with destruction of government property for getting his blood on their uniforms. Holder hasn't restricted his investigators to keeping their inquiry in Ferguson, either. The Times reports that federal watchdogs could also begin digging into civil rights issues in the St. Louis County police force and other departments in the St. Louis area. Much of St. Louis County is heavily segregated and many black-majority areas are policed by departments that are overwhelmingly white. Ferguson is two-thirds black, but only four of the department's 53 officers are black. In nearby Dellwood, nearly 80percent of residents are black, but 17 of the town's 18 police officers are white. In addition to the federal investigation, the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney has convened a grand jury to look into the case. That could result in charges being filed against Wilson, if it finds he fired without just cause. The Ferguson Police Department is also conducting an internal review of the case. Police have said Brown was shot after a scuffle that broke out after Wilson told the teen and a friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk. Supporters of Wilson have defended the officer's actions by saying he was threatened by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds and was trying to go for the officer's gun. New images of Wilson (right) surfaced two days ago. Here he is pictured with an unidentified woman . New pictures that surfaced this week show Wilson and ex-wife Ashley Nicole at their wedding in Old Monroe, Missouri, in October 2011. They divorced last year . A police team prepare to disperse a group of protesters on August 13 during the daily clashes in Ferguson . A group of protesters in Ferguson, wearing t-shirts and  protesting peacefully at the weekend, with t-shirts and signs . Witnesses, . including Brown's friend, told the news media that Brown had his hands . up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. Many members of the . community claim Brown's shooting was a cold-blooded murder. The . department also released details of a robbery in which video footage . showed Brown stealing a box of cigars prior to his confrontation with . Wilson. His family . released a statement in response, in which they condemned the . information release which they said was 'intended to assassinate the . character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his . person in broad daylight.' An autopsy commissioned by Brown's family concluded that he was shot six times, twice in the head. The new Justice Department investigation goes far beyond the circumstances of the shooting. It will look at the actions of a police department that is predominantly white even though Ferguson is about 70 per cent black. Some in Ferguson have said police disproportionately target black motorists during traffic stops. A 2013 report by the Missouri attorney general's office found that Ferguson police stopped and arrested black drivers nearly twice as frequently as white motorists but were also less likely to find contraband among the black drivers. The Justice Department's civil rights division routinely investigates individual police departments when there are allegations of systemic use-of-force violations, racial bias or other problems. The investigations sometimes end in an agreement known as a consent decree, which lays out changes that the department must make. Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson did not immediately return a call seeking comment about the investigation. Meanwhile, it has been revealed Brown didn't face any juvenile charges at the time of his death and had never been charged with a serious felony such as murder, robbery or burglary. Those details emerged at a hearing in which two media organizations sought the release of any possible juvenile records for Michael Brown.","The fatal shooting of Michael Brown, 18, prompts massive investigation .

"The Internal Revenue Service has . lost emails from five more employees who are part of congressional . probes into the treatment of conservative groups that applied for . tax-exempt status, the tax service disclosed on Friday. The IRS said . in June that it could not locate an untold number of emails to and from . Lois Lerner, who headed the IRS division that processes applications for . tax-exempt status during the time that the targeting of Tea Party groups occurred. That revelation set off a new round of investigations . and congressional hearings. On . Friday, the IRS issued a report to Congress saying the agency also lost . emails from five other employees related to the probe, including two . agents who worked in a Cincinnati office processing applications for . tax-exempt status. Scroll down for video . Not only did the IRS lose former former tax-exempt director Lois Lerner's emails, it said today it lost the emails of five other employees associated with a Tea Party targeting scheme. Lerner is pictured here in March during a hearing on Capitol Hill . The . disclosure came on the same day the Senate's subcommittee on . investigations released competing reports on how the IRS handled . applications from political groups during the 2010 and 2012 elections. The . Democratic report, released by Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, said both . liberal and conservative groups were mistreated, revealing no political . bias by the IRS. The Republican report, issued by Sen. John McCain of . Arizona, said conservative groups were clearly treated worse. The . IRS inspector general set off a firestorm last year with an audit that . said IRS agents singled out tea party and other conservative groups for . inappropriate scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status. Lerner's . lost emails prompted a new round of scrutiny by Congress, the Justice . Department, the inspector general and at least two federal judges. The . IRS blamed computer crashes for all the lost emails. In a statement, . the IRS said all the crashes happened well before Congress launched its . investigations. The IRS first told Congress in June that other . employees involved in the probe also had computer problems. At the time, . IRS Commissioner John Koskinen promised lawmakers a report on whether . any had lost emails. The report was issued Friday. 'Throughout . this review, the IRS has found no evidence that any IRS personnel . deliberately destroyed any evidence,' the IRS statement said. 'To the . contrary, the computer issues identified appear to be the same sorts of . issues routinely experienced by employees within the IRS, in other . government agencies and in the private sector.' When . Congress started investigating the IRS last year, the agency identified . 82 employees who might have documents related to the inquiries. The IRS . said 18 of those people had computer problems between September 2009 . and February 2014. Of those employees, five probably lost emails — in . addition to Lerner — the agency said Friday. Lerner, . who was placed on leave and later retired, has emerged as a central . figure in congressional investigations. The other five employees appear . to be more junior than she. In . addition to the Cincinnati workers, they include a technical adviser to . Lerner, a tax law specialist and a group manager in the tax-exempt . division. In general, the IRS . said the workers archived emails on their computer hard drives when . their email accounts became too full. When those computers crashed, their . emails were lost. 'By all . accounts, in each instance the user contacted IT staff and attempted to . recover his or her data,' the IRS statement said. The . IRS has said it stored emails on backup tapes but those tapes were . re-used every six months. The inspector general's office is reviewing . those tapes to see if any old emails can be retrieved. 'The . IRS has lost thousands of emails, but worse yet, completely lost the . American people's trust,' said Sarah Swinehart, a spokeswoman for House . Ways and Means Republicans. 'The DOJ must appoint a special prosecutor . so the full truth can come out.' Attorney General Eric Holder has . turned down numerous requests from congressional Republicans for a . special prosecutor, citing numerous investigations already underway. In this April 9, 2013 photo Democratic Sen. Carl Levin, left, talks with Republican Sen. John McCain, on Capitol Hill in Washington. After investigating the IRS for more than a year, the two senators said today that they disagree on whether the tax agency treated conservative groups worse than their liberal counterparts when they applied for tax-exempt status . Friday's . reports by the Senate subcommittee on investigations mark the . conclusion of just one investigation. The Justice Department and three . other congressional committees are continuing their probes. Levin . is chairman of the investigations subcommittee and McCain is the . ranking Republican. Their staffs routinely work together on . investigations, and while they don't always agree on the results, it is . highly unusual for them to issue such diverging reports. The . investigation found that the IRS used inappropriate selection criteria, . burdensome questions and lengthy delays in processing applications for . 501(c)(4) tax exempt status from both conservative and liberal groups,' Levin said in a statement. The . Democratic report slams last year's audit by the IRS inspector general. It says the IG report was incomplete because it focused only on the . treatment of conservative groups. The IG's report 'produced distorted . audit results that continue to be misinterpreted,' the Democratic report . said. J. Russell George, the . Treasury inspector general for tax administration, said his . investigation is ongoing, with facts 'still coming to light.' 'I . firmly stand behind the audit report that we issued last year, showing . the inappropriate treatment of applicants for 501 (c)(4) status, for . which the IRS apologized,' George said in a statement. 'It is important . to remember that the IRS accepted all of the recommendations contained . in our audit report.' McCain's report says far more conservative groups were singled out . for extra scrutiny. They were also asked more questions and were more . likely to have their applications rejected or withdrawn. 'The . IRS selected conservative groups out of normal processing, placed them . on a separate list, stopped work on their applications completely, . forced them to answer intrusive questions about their behavior and . demeanor at meetings and delayed their applications for multiple years,' the Republican report said. 'Our investigation has uncovered no . evidence that liberal groups received the same expansive inappropriate . treatment that conservative groups received.' The . Democratic report said investigators reviewed 800,000 pages of . documents and conducted 22 interviews with current and former workers at . the IRS and the inspector general's office. The investigators were not allowed to see confidential taxpayer information, so many of . the documents were blacked out, however. Only . two committees in Congress have the authority to see confidential . taxpayer information: the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate . Finance Committee. Those two committees are continuing their probes.","In June the IRS admitted it could not locate an untold number of emails to and former tax-exempt division director Lois Lerner .

"Harry Kane scored a hat-trick before standing in as an inept emergency goalkeeper. But his chaotic game was merely a secondary tale. This match, this night, belonged to Erik Lamela and his brilliant ‘rabona’ goal. The Argentine cost Tottenham £30million. His goal might well be replayed more than 30 million times. Everyone at White Hart Lane had to do a double-take. Words cannot do it justice. Just watch it. ‘You could probably find a video on YouTube of me scoring a goal like that,’ joked Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino. ‘It was a big goal, a great goal, an unbelievable goal. I’m very happy for him to score a goal like this. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Erik Lamela stunned White Hart Lane with his outrageous 'rabona' striker from 20 yards .

Lamela's first goal of the night against Asteras was worthy of Tottenham securing the three Europa League points on Thursday night . This graphic shows how Lamela scored his 'rabona' goal for Tottenham from just outside the area . Tottenham Hotspur (4-2-3-1): Lloris 6, Dier 6.5, Fazio 6.5, Vertonghen 6.5, Davies 6.5, Lamela 7.5 (Eriksen, 76), Capoue 6.5, Dembele 6.5, Townsend 6.5 (Lennon, 83), Kane 7, Adebayor 6.5 (Chadli, 76) Subs (not used): Vorm, Chiriches, Soldado,  Stambouli .

Goals: Barrales (89) Yellow cards: Panteliadis . Man of the match: Erik Lamela . Referee: Ivan Kruzliak (Slovakia) ‘Was it the best goal scored by one of my teams in my career? Probably, yes. He practises it every day in training. It’s a goal only a player with his skill can score.’ In a strange way, Asteras Tripolis were happy Lamela scored such a sensational goal against them, possibly the best moment produced by a Spurs player since Gareth Bale ripped Inter Milan to pieces. From the outset, the Greeks looked happy just to be at White Hart Lane, soaking in the occasion by taking selfies on the pitch and mingling with travelling supporters ahead of kick-off. They did create the first clear opportunity when Pablo Mazza bore down on Hugo Lloris’s goal, but, under pressure from Jan Vertonghen, dragged his strike horribly wide. Kane then followed suit, firing a long-range effort wide 30 seconds later. The Greeks should have heeded that warning, though, as Kane put Spurs ahead from a similar position. Picking up the ball 25 yards out, the England Under 21 star unleashed a right-foot rocket that flew past Tomas Kosicky in the 13th minute. Yet, the Greeks refused to hide, going close to an equaliser in the 26th minute after Thanasis Panteliadis’ header from Martin Rolle’s deep free-kick flew narrowly wide. They went even closer two minutes later, Ben Davies clearing Facundo Parra’s effort off the line after a rare error by Lloris. But then came a moment that will become an internet sensation as Lamela brought the house down with his wondrous goal — not that you would have guessed from the reaction of Pochettino, who sat motionless on the bench. ‘I never show emotion when we score,’ he said. ‘I always try to stay calm — but when I see it again I will enjoy it.’ He certainly will. Maybe, Lamela can finally start to consistently show the undoubted talent that prompted Spurs to break their transfer record to sign him from Roma last summer. Yet, just six minutes later, he showed the inconsistency that has been a source of frustration. As Spurs broke after a Asteras corner, Lamela needed only to play a simple pass to put Emmanuel Adebayor free on goal. Instead, he passed to Kane, who was offside. Pochettino was livid. Andros Townsend saw a 30-yard strike fly inches wide in the 40th minute and Lamela’s deflected drive from the edge of the box bounced wide during the opening stages of the second half.

Kane  scores a goal against Asteras Tripolis during their Europa League match at White Hart Lane on Thursday night . Kane celebrates putting Tottenham ahead in the 13th minute as the Premier League club took their chances at White Hart Lane . The first reported rabona was by Ricardo Infante in Argentina in a game between Estudiantes de la Plata and Rosario Central in 1948. Football magazine El Grafico then set up a front cover showing Infante dressed as a pupil with the caption 'Infante played hooky' ('rabona' in Spanish means to play hooky or to skip school). Hence, the rabona was born. But it proved to be the Argentine’s night as he increased the advantage in the 65th minute with an excellently executed left-foot volley that flew past Kosicky. That was far from the end of the action, however, as Kane’s night ended in a whirlwind. He grabbed his second from close range after Kosicky failed to hold Mousa Dembele’s effort in the 75th minute and completed his hat-trick nine minutes from time by heading home Federico Fazio’s cross. But the drama wasn’t over for Kane as he was forced to the spend the final three minutes in goal after Lloris was sent off for bringing down Tsos Tsokanis. And the forward made a complete hash of dealing with Jeronimo Barrales’s free-kick, letting the effort go under his body as the Greeks grabbed a late consolation. On the red card, Pochettino added: ‘I think Hugo was correct, but unlucky because it was a red card. ‘But I am not happy with the last minutes because our defensive line was very high and we gave them the possibility to play in behind our defensive line.’ Who said the Europa League was boring?

"A fare-dodger who shot a rookie cop in both legs told a judge 'f*** it' when asked if he had anything to say before he was sentenced today. Rashaun Robinson was given 25 years in prison for shooting James Li, who had graduated the New York City police academy just two months before he was shot in Brooklyn in February. Before he was sentenced, 29-year-old Robinson had tried to withdraw his guilty plea, saying he had been given bad advice by his lawyer and had been on medication, the New York Post reported. But Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Alan Marrus said he had no reason to do so. Locked up: Rashaun Robinson, left, has been sentenced to 25 years for shooting NYPD Officer James Li, right, in the legs after he pulled him off a bus in Brooklyn for failing to pay his fare . Defiant: Robinson, pictured in February ahead of his arraignment, told a judge 'f*** it' when asked if he had anything to say at his sentencing. He previously lamented that the police officer was still able to walk . 'This case demonstrates that a lawbreaker can be the one who overreacts in a confrontation with a police officer,' Marrus said, apparently referencing the incident in Ferguson earlier this summer. 'It's a stark example of the extreme danger a police officer faces.' Robinson shot Li, 27, after the cop pulled him off a bus in Crown Heights, Brooklyn on February 26 for skipping his fare. Two off-duty fire department  EMTs, Khadijah Hall and Shaun Alexander, ran to Li's side and gave him aid as they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Li suffered nerve damage and now uses a cane and walks with a limp. He undergoes physical therapy a few times a week. After his arrest, Robinson said he had wanted to kill a police officer that day and said he carried a gun because cops thought they ran everything. Scene: After Li was hit, two off-duty fire department paramedics came to his aid. He survived but suffered severe nerve damage and now uses a cane to walk and has a limp . 'They are the biggest gang in New York and are always messing with black people and he is sick of it,' he said, according to court papers. When Robinson pleaded guilty to aggravated assault in August, the judge asked him whether he was aware of the pain he had inflicted on Li. He responded coldly: 'He can still walk.' Following the sentencing on Wednesday, Li dismissed his assailant as 'dumb'. 'I'm just glad he's getting 25 [years],' the police officer told the Post.","Rashaun Robinson shot James Li, 27, in the legs when he pulled him off a bus for skipping the fare in Brooklyn, New York in February .

"Manchester United are satisfied with assurances from Radamel Falcao and his camp that the Colombia star has not lied about his age. Reports resurfaced over the weekend claiming that Falcao is 30, not 28. The issue is sensitive because United have an option to sign the striker on a long-term contract at the end of his £6million loan move from Monaco next summer, taking the total fee to £52m. It is understood that United sought assurances on deadline day and were happy with the documentation provided. VIDEO Scroll down to Watch Radamel Falcao's five best goals for Monaco .

United said: ‘We were aware of the rumours but it was never an issue for us.’ Controversy first arose when Falcao, who made his senior debut for Colombian Second Division club Lanceros at the age of 13, was playing for River Plate in Argentina. It was then alleged that he had doctored his age so he could play at the Under-20 World Cup in 2005. In 2012, Falcao’s old school leaked documents claiming that he was born in 1984. That led to his family releasing his birth certificate to the Colombian media. United’s chief concern was Falcao’s left knee after surgery to repair a cruciate ligament injury. The player passed a rigorous United medical before making his Colombia comeback on Friday in Miami, when he played 13 minutes of a 1-0 loss to Brazil. Falcao said later: ‘Physically, I feel spectacular. As I get into game shape, I believe I’ll show I’m still at the top level.’ While in Miami, Falcao applied for his visa at the British Consulate. United expect none of the complications that delayed clearance for Marcos Rojo, their Argentine signing.

"Al Qaeda has expanded into the Indian subcontinent, the leader of the terror group said in a video statement released Thursday, with a regional group that he vowed would bring Islamic law to the region and 'wage jihad against its enemies.' At least three Indian states with large Muslim populations had been put on alert in the wake of the video's release, local TV stations reported. In the video, which was seen online by the Site monitoring group, Ayman al-Zawahiri said Al Qaeda had been preparing for years to set up in the region. Scroll down for video . Twisted: In this image taken from video, Ayman al-Zawahiri, head of Al Qaeda, delivers a statement about the terrorist group expanding into India . The new group 'is the fruit of a blessed effort of more than two years to gather the mujahedeen in the Indian subcontinent into a single entity,' al-Zawahiri said. While the statement referred to the 'Indian subcontinent' - a term that most commonly refers to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal - al-Zawahiri's comments were widely seen as directed at India, a largely Hindu nation with a large Muslim minority. Al-Zawahiri said the group, Qaedat al-Jihad in the Indian subcontinent, would fight for an Islamic state and laws across the region, 'which was part of the Muslims' territories before it was occupied by the infidel enemy'. Until recently, India had largely seen itself as beyond the recruiting territory of international jihadists like Al Qaeda. Over the past few months, however, the Islamic State militant group, which has seized control of large parts of Iraq and Syria, has grown in prominence in India, and is increasingly believed to be gaining followers here. Sickening: Al Qaeda often targets civilians using suicide bombers. Pictured is a crater formed by an explosion next to the devastated Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on September 21, 2008, following an attack by the group that left 60 dead . Al Qaeda leader Ayman al ZawahIri  announced the formation of an Indian branch of his militant group he said would spread Islamic rule and 'raise the flag of jihad' across the subcontinent. He said: 'My Muslim brothers everywhere, peace be with you today, I announce to all Muslims in the world and especially in the Indian subcontinent, the founding of a new branch of Qaedat al-Jihad. 'This is to help raise the flag of jihad and the return of the Islamic rule in the subcontinent, which one day used to be part of the land of the Muslims until the infidel enemy took it over and divided it.' He also renewed a longstanding vow of loyalty to Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Omar, in an apparent snub to the Islamic State armed group challenging al Qaeda for leadership of transnational Islamist militancy. Zawahri described the formation of 'Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent' as glad tidings for Muslims 'in Burma, Bangladesh, Assam, Gujarat, Ahmedabad, and Kashmir' and said the new wing would rescue Muslims there from injustice and oppression. Last month, an Indian engineering student who had traveled to Iraq with friends, and who was thought to have joined the Islamic State, was reported killed. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh met Thursday morning with top security and intelligence officials to discuss the threat. A spokesman for India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said the statement was 'a matter of serious concern. But there is nothing to worry about. We have a strong government at the federal level.' India, though, has a notoriously underfunded and ill-trained security infrastructure. In 2008, a small group of Pakistani militants attacked Mumbai, India's financial hub, effectively shutting down the city for days and leaving 166 people killed. New Delhi has also waged a long-running insurgency war in Kashmir, India's only majority-Muslim state, with militants fighting to bring independence to the Himalayan region or join it to neighboring Pakistan. The fighting has left thousands of people dead. Some analysts saw the announcement, which showed al-Zawahiri speaking in front of a dark curtain, as an effort to revive the fortunes of Al Qaeda, which has been largely eclipsed, at least publicly, by the Islamic State, the militant group that in Syria and Iraq that recently executed two American journalists. 'This may be ruse for al-Zawahiri  to enhance his diminishing clout among Arab Muslims and Pakistani mujahedeen who are veering in a big way toward the Islamic State militant group  leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,' said Rana Banerji, a prominent Indian intelligence and security analyst. Omar Hamid, Head of Asia Analysis at IHS Country Risk, meanwhile, said that Al Qaeda's establishment of a local branch in India seems geared to take advantage of the trend of fighters returning from Afghanistan . He said: 'Al Qaeda leader Ayman Al Zawahiri's announcement of the creation of a branch of al Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent, to be known as Qaedat-al-Jihad, is a likely response to recent global and regional developments. 'For some time now, al Qaeda has seen its authority eroded by the fact that it is no longer able to independently carry out large scale attacks anywhere in the world, and by the emergence of rival factions. 'In light of the ISAF withdrawal from Afghanistan in December 2014, some battle hardened fighters freed up from Afghanistan will almost certainly transition into India, thus increasing the capacity of local groups. Al Qaeda's establishment of a local branch seems geared to take advantage of this trend.'","Ayman al-Zawahiri said Al Qaeda would fight for an Islamic state in India .

NBC News reported its sources revealed 'a military drone launched Hellfire missiles at at least two vehicles in a remote area of southern Somalia, with al-Shabaab's top leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, believed to have been the target.' The U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday by seven heavily armed suspected Islamic militants who attempted to free other extremists held there. The Pentagon statement did not indicate whether the U.S. action was related to the prison attack. Somali officials said all attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Spokesman: Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement 'We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate' (file photo) Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The Somali rebel group al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaida, claimed responsibility for the attack that shattered a period of calm in Mogadishu after two decades of chaotic violence. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison, followed by gunmen who fought their way into the prison. According to CNN, Somalia's Information Minister H. E. Duhulow said 'These terrorists groups are against the security improvements we are currently experiencing here in Mogadishu. We say to them that these foiled attacks strengthen our forces and prove their bravery to the people of Somalia.' It was al-Shabab gunmen who attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, with guns and grenades last September, killing at least 67 people.","The Pentagon said U.S. military forces targeted the Islamic extremist al-Shabab network in an operation Monday in Somalia .

"For the first time in more than a decade, Army veteran Joseph Jones was able to recognize bits of his old face in the mirror following a eight-hour procedure to repair damage to his face sustained by a roadside bomb. Over the course of the surgery, performed in South Miami, roughly 3,000 follicles were transplanted from to Jones' face, returning the beard and eyebrows he had before the explosion that burned them away while serving in the Iraq war. Jones was the beneficiary of Faces of Honor program, an initiative from . the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to . help Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Scroll down for video . Dr. Jeffrey Epstein marks Army vet Joseph Jones on the areas he plans to transplant new hair follicles where Jones was injured in combat . Joseph Jones undergoes facial hair transplant surgery in Miami by surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Epstein, right, and his assistant Jose Armas, left, so Jones can grow a beard for the first time in a decade . The follicles on Jones' face were killed by a roadside blast while serving in Iraq in 2004 . Jones, 35, of Youngstown, Fla., told The Miami Herald that he felt as if the injury that robbed him of his hair permanently altered his identity. 'After the IED blast, my hair would not grow on my face. I don’t . have eyebrows, eyelashes or a beard. I looked odd and sometimes people . would stare at me,' Jones said. 'I feel like I lost a part of . my identity when I lost my hair.' The procedure was performed by MIami-Dade surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Epstein. Without the Faces of Honor program, the procedure would normally cost about $16,000. 'We are trying to . make these veterans look whole. There is a difference between healed and . whole,' Dr. Charlie Finn, the humanitarian chair of the plastic . surgery academy, told The Miami Herald. Only a few procedures have been done for the program so far, generally focusing on burns or scars. The little-known program relies on surgeons donating their services. Veterans must have a combat injury from Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom and an honorable discharge to qualify. Jones, 35, of Youngstown, Fla., told The Miami Herald that he felt as if the injury that robbed him of his hair permanently altered his identity . Epstein says the procedures can be an important step in psychological recovery. 'The . facial hair loss for Jones raises the memories of what was a trauma,' he said. 'The beard and facial hair . will put him in harmony with how he feels. It’s going to make a . difference.' The back third of Jones' hair was shaved for the procedure to be used as donor hair. Epstein also used blue marker to outline eyebrows and a beard on his patient's face. They injected Jones with a local anesthetic where the grafts would be harvested. Epstein then used a microscopic drill to make micro-punches for donor tissue. Epstein said has performed more than 9,000 of these procedures. Jones told reporters he wanted to follow the family tradition of service (his grandfather, father, and uncle were all in the Army) since he was a young boy. As a child, he sat in rapt attention watching movies like Top Gun and Iron Eagle. 'When I saw those movies, I knew that was my course in life,' he said. 'I knew I wanted to serve my country.' Jones told reporters he wanted to follow the family tradition of service (his grandfather, father, and uncle were all in the Army) since he was a young boy . He finally got his wish, deploying to Iraq in 2004. In March of that year, he and four other soldiers were the victims of a roadside bomb when their Humvee triggered a blast on a trip to deliver food. The hair follicles on Jones' face were deadened and his skin pigment damaged, though no one was seriously injured. 'It . was almost like a grease fire like you see in the kitchen, but it took . off my eyebrows and eyelashes,' eh said. 'When I was receiving treatment, the . doctors told me everything would grow back. But it never did. I can grow a goatee, but only because it was covered during the blast . by my chinstrap.' He was injured again eight months later in a second roadside explosion that damaged his left knee and right ankle, and sent him back to the U.S. with a limp. He says he's since had trouble finding a steady job because he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. Some have even joked that his appearance leaves him looking like 'Powder,' the hairless albino character from a 1995 film. Jones was the beneficiary of Faces of Honor program, an initiative from the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to help Iraq and Afghanistan veterans . He discovered the Faces of Honor program earlier this year, and was evaluated by Epstein in August. 'The hair is a way for me to feel better about yourself,' Jones said. At the end of the procedure, Jones said the resulting grafts looked like stubble from a five o'clock shadow, and were sensitive to touch. After two weeks those hairs will fall out, then four months later new hairs should regenerate. 'Some people might look at me and say I don’t need hair,' Jones said. 'But this is important to me. I want to look normal.'","Joseph Jones lost his facial follicles in 2004 when he was injured in by roadside bomb in Iraq .

"Researchers from Washington State University found that female rats were 30 per cent more sensitive to the pain-relieving qualities of marijuana than male rats . Women are more likely to suffer negative effects of smoking cannabis - including depression, anxiety and paranoia - because their oestrogen levels make them more sensitive to its active ingredient, according to new research. U.S. researchers found that female rats were at least 30 per cent more sensitive than males to the pain-relieving qualities of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in cannabis, because of their increased oestrogen levels. Experts said that the increased concentration of THC in today’s cannabis meant smokers are more likely to experience negative effects including anxiety, confusion, panic attacks, hallucinations or extreme paranoia, with women more at risk than men. Previous studies have shown that women are more prone to cannabis abuse and dependence than men. In women, cannabis withdrawal symptoms including irritability, sleep disruption and decreased food intake were shown to be more severe. Women were also more likely to relapse when trying to quit smoking the drug. The only effect of THC which appears to be more pronounced in men is in terms of appetite. Studies in California found that THC stimulated the appetites of male animals more than those of females, meaning the ‘munchie effect’ might be stronger for men than women. The new study, published in journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, looked at the pain-relieving effects of THC on male and female rats. After ten days of treatment, female rats were shown to be significantly more tolerant to THC than males. Tolerance occurs when the rat ‘adapts’ to THC so that larger doses are required to produce the same pain-relieving effects seen with the first dose. Researchers expected females to be more sensitive to THC, so adjusted their doses to be 30 per cent lower than the doses for males. The females still developed more tolerance. Lead author Professor Rebecca Craft, of Washington State University said: ‘This is the lowest dose anyone has ever used to induce tolerance. ‘What we're finding with THC is that you get a very clear spike in drug sensitivity right when the females are ovulating - right when their oestrogen levels have peaked and are coming down,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Researchers said higher concentrations of active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in today's marijuana means negative effects like anxiety, depression and paranoia are more likely, and women are at higher risk . Professor Craft warned that marijuana that exists today has much higher concentrations of THC than in previous years, meaning negative side effects are much more likely, with women at higher risk due to their increased sensitivity to the compound. ‘Marijuana is very different than it was 40 years ago,’ she said. ‘It's much higher in THC and lower in cannabidiol, so a little bit goes a very long way. ‘We're more likely to see negative side effects today like anxiety, confusion, panic attacks, hallucinations or extreme paranoia. And women are at higher risk.’ She added that despite the known differences in how marijuana affects women and men, most THC tolerance studies have been done on males as women’s hormone levels tend to vary throughout the month. Researchers also found that a low dose of THC did not disrupt the reproductive cycle in female rats, which has been under debate.","Study found female rats were 30% more sensitive to THC than male rats .

"Conjoined twin brothers who share three legs, intestines, a bladder, liver and genitals are today preparing for major life-changing surgery to be separated. Surgeons in Brazil will perform the operation to separate Artur and Heitor Rocha, who are joined at the pelvis. The five-year-olds  share three legs, their intestines, a bladder, a liver and their genitals, which will be divided out during the procedure. The boys, from Bahia in Brazil, will be separated at the hips and each will be left with just one leg, their third leg being used for vital skin grafts. Scroll down for video . Conjoined twin brothers Artur and Heitor Rocha, pictured with their mother Eliane, are set to be separated when surgeons operate on them in the coming months . The boys, from Bahia in Brazil, share three legs, their intestines, a bladder, a liver and genitals . Artur will have two kidneys, while his brother will be left with just one, and only one of the boys will have genitals after separation, meaning further reconstructive procedures will be necessary. The operation carries a high risk, but concerned parents Eliane and Rocha, both teachers, decided to go ahead to enable their sons to finally become independent. The boy's mother Eliane, 37, said: 'When I talk to them about the big surgery, they say they want to be separated. It's not just mine and my family's will, it's theirs too. 'They want to be independent. They want to make their own decisions about where to go. 'I know I'm not imposing anything on them.' Artur and Heitor are currently undergoing treatment in Goiania to stretch their skin with silicone expanders. The procedure will create enough excess skin to stitch up the chest, stomach and pelvis of each boy after the difficult separation. Their mother, said: 'Every day I am more confident that day is nearer. The doctors are very positive, they are very hopeful because the skin treatments are working.' Paediatrician Dr Zacharias Calil, who will be performing the separation surgery, has cared for Artur and Heitor since their birth in April 2009. He said: 'This is a complex case. We've gone through a lot with these children, so the risk goes up a lot. 'The separation itself is not majorly complicated to do, for someone with the experience. 'What makes this very complicated, apart from the separation, is the post-op. 'We don't know how they're going to react, in terms of their metabolism. There are no studies about that.' After the high-risk operation Artur will be left with two kidneys, while Heitor will have one, and only one of the boys will have genitals, meaning further reconstructive surgery will be necessary . Paediatrician Dr Zacharias Calil said: 'This is a complex case. We've gone through a lot with these children, so the risk goes up a lot. What makes this very complicated, apart from the separation, is the post-op' Eliane found out that she was having conjoined twins five months into her pregnancy following a  scan during her second trimester. Devastated, the mother-to-be and her husband struggled to cope with the news, worrying not only for the health of the babies but for her health too. Hurriedly the couple sought out the best doctor who reassured them Eliane wouldn't suffer or be in danger during the pregnancy. Despite their concerns they made the decision not to abort the pregnancy and the boys were born without any complications four months later. After the birth, Eliane stayed in hospital for 22 days learning special ways to bathe and breastfeed her newborns. The mother-of-three said: 'The doctor said it was one of the most complicated cases he had ever seen. 'It felt very emotional after the birth, I always imagined how they would look like, but actually seeing them was a very different experience.' Eliane - who already had a daughter Cecilia - struggled to adjust to caring for the twins. She added: 'Initially it was difficult. Up until they were four months old they cried a lot. They would spend all night crying. 'Sometimes one is really energetic and awake and the other one is sleeping. But they don't bother each other. The boys have already been into hospital to have their skin stretched ahead of the surgery, which will take place in the coming  months . Eliane, who is also mother to Cecilia, pictured with her brothers, said: 'I'm looking forward to it, I want their lives to be better, and I do believe that day is coming' 'One never wakes the other up, they let each other sleep. 'When they were younger that bothered us. Because if they were awake at different time, it meant we had to be awake at all times. And although they have spent their whole lives together, Artur and Heitor have very different personalities. 'We do notice there are a lot of differences between the two of them,' Eliane said. 'Each of them has a distinct personality - one is more tough and the other a little sweeter. They are both lovely though. 'Sometimes they want to play at different things, or go to a different place, and we have to try and make them understand that they have to compromise.' The final separation surgery is expected to take place in a few months' time and Eliane is focusing on thinking positively. She said: 'Now we're really just waiting for separation surgery. 'I'm looking forward to it, I want their lives to be better, and I do believe that day is coming.'

"Hollywood studios and TV firms have long tried to persuade us that donning a pair of 3D glasses will improve our TV and movie experience. However, researchers have shown they are a waste of money - and that we have exactly the same emotional response whether footage is in 2D or 3D. Researchers monitored palm sweat, breathing and cardiovascular responses such as heart rate in a bid to see if 3D was worth the extra cash. Scroll down for video . Is one being ripped off? Prince Charles dons a pair of 3D glasses. However, researchers have shown they are a waste of money - and that we have exactly the same emotional response whether footage is in 2D or 3D. Researchers looked at several measures of emotional state in 408 subjects, including palm sweat, breathing and cardiovascular responses, such as heart rate. These measures are commonly used to gauge emotional responses. Four film clips were chosen because each prompted one discrete emotion intensely and in context without viewing the entire film. Study participants viewed a 3-D and 2-D clip of approximately five minutes of each film: 'My Bloody Valentine' (fear), 'Despicable Me' (amusement), 'Tangled' (sadness) and 'The Polar Express' (thrill or excitement). Participants were randomized to view the films in a design that balanced the pairs of films watched, in which format, and order of presentation. The increased visual realism of 3-D films is claimed to offer viewers a more vivid and lifelike experience—more thrilling and intense than 2-D because it more closely approximates real life. Researchers at the University of Utah wanted to see if the claims were true. Author Sheila Crowell said the results suggest that as an entertainment medium, 3-D may not provide a different experience from 2-D, insofar as evoking emotional responses go. 'We set out to learn whether technological advances like 3-D enhance the study of emotion, especially for young patients who are routinely exposed to high-tech devices and mediums in their daily lives,' says Crowell. 'Both 2-D and 3-D are equally effective at eliciting emotional responses, which also may mean that the expense involved in producing 3-D films is not creating much more than novelty. Researchers found that 3D is a waste of money - and that we have exactly the same emotional response whether footage is in 2D or 3D. 'Further studies are of course warranted, but our findings should be encouraging to researchers who cannot now afford 3-D technologies. 'This could also be good news for people who would rather not wear 3-D glasses or pay the extra money to see these types of films.' The results, published recently in PLOS ONE. The study aimed to validate the effectiveness of 3-D film, a newer technology, as compared to 2-D film that is currently widely used as a research tool. Film clips are used in psychological and neuroscience studies as a standardized method for assessing emotional development. Because it is less invasive than other methods, it is especially useful when studying the emotional responses of young people for whom emotional well-being is critical to healthy development. How the study was conducted . Researchers looked at several measures of emotional state in 408 subjects, including palm sweat, breathing and cardiovascular responses, such as heart rate. These measures are commonly used to gauge emotional responses. Four film clips were chosen because each prompted one discrete emotion intensely and in context without viewing the entire film. The only difference was seen during a thrilling scene from 'The Polar Express' in 3-D.The researchers believe that could be because the 3-D content of the film is of especially high quality, with more and a larger variety of 3-D effects than the others. Study participants viewed a 3-D and 2-D clip of approximately five minutes of each film: 'My Bloody Valentine' (fear), 'Despicable Me' (amusement), 'Tangled' (sadness) and 'The Polar Express' (thrill or excitement). Participants were randomized to view the films in a design that balanced the pairs of films watched, in which format, and order of presentation. The complex configurations allowed the researchers to compare not only emotional responses, but effects of format and viewing order on the results. Taken as a whole, the results showed few significant differences between physiological reactions to the films. When accounting for the large number of statistical tests, only one difference was seen between the formats—the number of electrodermal responses (palm sweat) during a thrilling scene from 'The Polar Express' 3-D clip. The researchers believe that could be because the 3-D content of the film is of especially high quality, with more and a larger variety of 3-D effects than the others.","Researchers monitored responses to a series of 2D and 3D clips .

"Defence Secretary Michael Fallon warned some areas were 'swamped' by migrants . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon provoked a furious row yesterday after warning that communities were being ‘swamped’ by European immigrants. Last night he was reprimanded by No 10 for his use of the word and rival politicians lined up to criticise what they called his ‘excessive language’. Tory backbenchers, however, said it was appalling that a minister had been told to retract comments when all he had done was speak out frankly on immigration. During a TV interview, Mr Fallon said some towns were ‘under siege’ from ‘huge numbers’ of migrants and that action was needed to tackle free movement rules. He spoke of trying to ‘prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers’. He was responding to a question about German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s declaration that she would not back the UK’s bid to change the rules – a major blow to David Cameron. But his use of the word ‘swamped’ in relation to immigration and asylum – which has long been toxic in British politics, provoked fierce criticism. Even Ukip’s immigration spokesman branded his words ‘excessive’. Last night a government source said Mr Fallon had admitted he had made a mistake, and should have used the less emotive term ‘under pressure’. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the fact Mr Fallon had used such language showed how ‘panicked’ the Conservatives were over their failure to control migration and the threat posed by his party at next month’s Rochester and Strood by-election. In an embarrassing mark of Coalition disarray, another Cabinet minister said Britain actually needed EU migrants to fill unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector in the very same areas Mr Fallon was referring to. Asked if she agreed that migrants were needed, Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss told the BBC’s Sunday Politics: ‘I accept we do, yes.’ ‘I’m an MP in Norfolk, and there is an element of migrant work force, that’s very true,’ she said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is meant to be one of Mr Cameron’s key supporters in the EU reform drive, delivered a major blow when she said she would not support his demands for radical changes to the central EU tenet of free movement of workers. The Prime Minister has promised that clawing back control over immigration will be a ‘red line issue’ in renegotiating UK membership terms, ahead of a mooted in-out referendum if he is still in power in 2017. David Cameron had indicated  migration reforms as key to mooted renegotiation of the UK's membership terms . Angel Merkel has made clear she is not open to renegotiation on the free movement of people across the European Union . But Mrs Merkel told the Sunday Times: ‘Germany will not tamper with the fundamental principles of free movement in the EU.’ The row flared as Mr Cameron prepared to face MPs today on the EU’s shock demand for an extra £1.7billion. Politicians have faced criticism before for the use of the word ‘swamped’ when talking about immigration. In 2002, David Blunkett refused to apologise for saying asylum seekers were ‘swamping’ some British schools. The then Labour Home Secretary made his remarks while defending the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill. The Campaign for Racial Equality said they were ‘hugely emotive’. In 1978, Margaret Thatcher said people feared being ‘swamped’ by immigration from the new Commonwealth and Pakistan. On the prospect of four million immigrants, she said: ‘Now, that is an awful lot and I think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.’ Speaking on the Murnaghan programme on Sky News, Mr Fallon said that despite Mrs Merkel’s comments, all was not lost – because negotiations had not even started yet. ‘The Germans haven’t seen our proposal yet, and we haven’t seen our proposal yet,’ he said. ‘That is still being worked on at the moment to see what we can do to prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers. ‘In some areas, particularly on the east coast, yes, towns do feel under siege from large numbers of migrant workers and people claiming benefits. It is quite right that we look at that.’ Politicians from all sides lined up to criticise his language. Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said politicians needed to be responsible in the words they used when discussing the issue. Labour’s Europe spokesman Pat McFadden told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend: ‘That’s certainly not language I would use.’ Steven Woolfe, Ukip’s immigration spokesman, said: ‘Can you imagine what would have been said if we had said that?’ Later in the day, the Government put out a statement saying: ‘He accepts he should have chosen his words better. He should have said “under pressure”.’ But the slap-down attracted criticism from Tory backbenchers last night. Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said: ‘What the Old Etonian praetorian guard around the Prime Minister have done shows how out of touch they are, and how in touch Michael Fallon is. ‘Margaret Thatcher used the word “swamped”, and she was in touch with public opinion. Michael Fallon was speaking up for millions up and down the country.’ Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Number 10 and Mr Fallon are saying the same thing, but he is reflecting more the words you hear on the doorstep.’ Ukip targets 100 seats . Ukip will try to win 100 seats at the general election as it seeks to build on a surge in support, the party’s biggest donor has revealed. Businessman Paul Sykes said the anti-EU party would widen its ambitions and invest in an ad campaign that would be ‘seen from the Moon’. Mr Sykes, who will give another £1.5 million to help step up the drive, said Ukip will be raising ‘significant further funds’ as it targets many more marginal seats than the few dozen it had originally identified. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is hopeful of winning 100 seats in the May general election, a donor revealed . He told the Sunday Times: ‘Ukip is not going to lose the campaign because we don’t have enough adverts.’ Research by Opinium for the Observer yesterday found that nearly a third of the public would vote Ukip if they thought it could win in their area. Former Home Office minister Damian Green warned that it would be a ‘complete disaster’ if the Tories became ‘Ukip-lite’, urging the Conservatives to ‘calm down’.","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claims some areas are 'under siege'

"It might seem impossible to identify a dozen images flashing by in a fraction of a second. But a team of neuroscientists has found that the human brain can do just that at record-breaking speed. U.S. researchers discovered that the human brain can interpret images that the eye sees in just 13 milliseconds - the first evidence of such rapid processing speed. U.S. researchers discovered that the human brain can interpret images that the eye sees in just 13 milliseconds - the first evidence of such rapid processing speed. It was previously thought it took almost eight times longer for humans to process a picture . That speed is almost eight times faster than the 100 milliseconds recorded by previous studies. Researchers asked subjects to look for a particular type of image, such as picnic or smiling couple, as they viewed a series of six or 12 pictures, each presented for between 13 and 80 milliseconds. ‘The fact that you can do that at these high speeds indicates to us that what vision does is find concepts,’ said Mary Potter, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and senior author of the study. ‘That’s what the brain is doing all day long - trying to understand what we’re looking at,’ she added. This rapid-fire processing may help direct the eyes, which shift their gaze three times per second, to their next target, Professor Potter explained in the study, published in the journal Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics. Researchers asked subjects to look for a particular type of image, such as picnic or smiling couple, as they viewed a series of six or 12 images, each presented for between 13 and 80 milliseconds. An image of birds used in the study is pictured . 13 milliseconds is the time it takes for the human eye to process an image. That speed is almost eight times faster than the 100 milliseconds recorded by previous studies. The study suggests that while the images are seen for only 13 milliseconds before the next image appears, part of the brain continues to process those images for longer than that. The findings are consistent with a 2001 study from researchers at the University of Parma and the University of St. Andrews,. They found that neurons in the brains of macaque monkeys that respond to specific types of image could be activated even when the target images were each presented for only 14 milliseconds in a rapid sequence. ‘The job of the eyes is not only to get . the information into the brain, but to allow the brain to think about it . rapidly enough to know what you should look at next. ‘So in general we’re calibrating our eyes so they move around just as often as possible consistent with understanding what we’re seeing,’ she said. After an image ‘hits’ the retina, the information such as shape, colour, and orientation is processed by the brain. The study suggests that while the . images are seen for only 13 milliseconds before the next image appears, . part of the brain continues to process those images for longer than . that. ‘If images were . wiped out after 13 milliseconds, people would never be able to respond . positively after the sequence.

She previously found that humans . can correctly identify images seen for as little as 100 milliseconds, . but her new research suggests we can do this almost eight times faster. In the new study, the researchers . gradually increased the speed of images until they reached a point where . subjects’ answers were no better than if they were guessing. The . MIT team found that although overall performance declined, subjects . continued to perform better than chance as the researchers gradually . decreased the image exposure time from 80 milliseconds to 13 . milliseconds, which was the fastest possible rate with the computer . monitor being used.

AN MRI scan of a human head is pictured . ‘This didn’t really fit with…common assumptions my colleagues and I have had for what you can see,’ Professor Potter said. She believes one reason for the subjects’ better performance in this study may be that they were able to practice fast detection as the images were presented progressively faster. The subjects also received feedback on their performance after each trial, allowing them to adapt to this incredibly fast presentation. At the highest rate, subjects were seeing new images more than 20 times as fast as vision typically absorbs information.","Newly recorded speed is almost eight times faster than the 100 milliseconds recorded by previous studies .

"Click here for all the stats, facts, line-ups and heat maps from Wembley Stadium . It was what Roy Hodgson hopes will become the old one-two. Raheem Sterling set it up, Wayne Rooney tucked it away. From the penalty spot, admittedly — but they all count. Certainly when a team has as much catching up to do as England. There is no point wallowing in the torpor that currently surrounds the national team, that backdrop of sighs and shrugs and whatevs that has haunted the group since Brazil. Yes, the new European Championship qualification process is boring. Yes, Roy Hodgson’s England team have been largely uninspiring. No, it won’t get any better in the next two seasons, until England meet strong opposition at the finals in France. We just have to be make the best of it until then. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney: Norway match was about the team, not me. We need to make the fans believe again . Never in doubt: England captain Wayne Rooney smashes home a penalty to give England the lead midway through the second half at Wembley . All smiles: Rooney is congratulated after scoring the winner for England in their first match since returning from the World Cup . England: Hart 6, Stones 6.5 (Chambers 81), Jones 6.5, Cahill 6.5 (Jagielka 84), Baines 6, Oxlade-Chamberlain 6 (Delph 69, 6), Henderson 6, Wilshere 6.5 (Milner 69, 6), Sterling 7.5, Rooney 6.5 (Welbeck 70, 6), Sturridge 6.5 (Lambert 89).

And while this wasn’t the best by any stretch of the imagination, there were glimpses, tiny reminders that, let off the leash, England do have some players worth watching. Chief among them, without doubt, is Raheem Sterling, who was the best player on the night, and could be among the finest in Europe one day. That his attacking verve created the goal for Rooney was no more than he deserved. Did Rooney deserve it? This wasn’t his greatest game, it must be said. Yet it was the game of a new captain itching to lead from the front and there was never any question over who would take the penalty. The skipper assumed the responsibility with relish and delivered what proved to be the winning goal in much the same fashion. This was hardly a fresh beginning but, in the circumstances, how could it be? Wembley was half-empty, if that, and Norway were uninspiring yet grimly cussed opponents — hard in the tackle and defending in deep banks as if a point was needed to qualify for a tournament of significance. Equally, this is an England manager and team still recovering from their earliest World Cup exit in half a century. Faults remain. The defence looks vulnerable to pressure and at times England’s build-up is ponderous. Several players often fail to replicate their club performances, and chances are frequently wasted. Rooney’s penalty was England’s first shot on target, and it came after 68 minutes. Reasons to be cheerful? They invariably start, as expected, with Sterling. He is already among the most promising teenagers in Europe and if Hodgson can harness his Liverpool form, England have a genuine match-winner. Danny Welbeck came on and forced the best save of the night from Norway goalkeeper Orjan Haskjold Nyland and Daniel Sturridge had a couple of near misses in the first half. But it is fair to say that most that was good about England came through Sterling, and any breakthrough was likely to come from him. New era: New England captain  Rooney leads out the England team in their first match after the World Cup . Sparse: The teams line up before kick-off with a sea of empty seats in the background, especially in the upper tier . Scene: Only a handful of tickets had been sold for the upper tier at Wembley in the 90,000-seat stadium . As it eventually did. Already the star of England’s show, it was Sterling’s determined running, in the face of some very close attention, that turned what would have been one very damp squib into a happier affair. There wasn’t much on when Sterling committed Omar Elabdellaoui on the left side of the penalty area, but he did enough to worry his man into diving in with an ill-judged and clumsy outstretched leg. Sterling was brought to the floor, referee Jorge Sousa pointed to the spot and Rooney collected the ball greedily. He is no fool. He knew this was his chance to change the narrative. There are some who would not have England’s captain in the starting line-up, but the way he simply leathered the ball into the top left corner of the goal was an emphatic statement. Damn the low-key surrounds, damn the low-key occasion. Rooney had talked of this as his moment and here he demonstrated a truly desperate desire to take it. Jordan Henderson produced another typically energetic performance, as his heat map (below) shows - CLICK HERE FOR OUR BRILLIANT MATCH ZONE PACKAGE . Sliding in: England left back Leighton Baines in challenged by Norway's Tarik Elyounoussi during the international friendly . Instruction: England manager Roy Hodgson has a word with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during a break in play during the first half . He was substituted two minutes later, no doubt to protect him for the bigger match in Basle on Monday. Did he have a great game? Not really. Did he catch the eye? Hardly. Was Welbeck more of a handful in his brief substitute appearance? Yes. Will Rooney play against Switzerland? Definitely. Hodgson will recall one of Rooney’s previous visits there, under Fabio Capello. It was among his finest games for England in recent years. If this rekindles those memories and sends him to Switzerland in a positive frame of mind, Hodgson will settle for that. Yet it is Sterling, not Rooney, who the Swiss will be eyeing after this. England do not have so many world beaters that he does not stand out. On the move: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge attempts to take on the Norway defence during the first half at Wembley . Challenge: Arsenal midfielder Jack WIlshere is brought down by former Gunners player Havard Nordtveit . Threat: Liverpool's teenage star Raheem Sterling runs at the Norwegian defence in an attempt to break the deadlock . Other good news about this England era? Certainly, journey times to Wembley have improved. With just over 40,000 inside, the North Circular at rush hour no longer resembles, well, the North Circular at rush hour. It takes no time to get here now, and you can probably get parked, too, considering many of the people in the stadium are not allowed to take holidays out of term time, let alone drive a car. There is also greater connection with the players, the fans now able to hear many of their cries on the pitch. Hodgson gave forceful instructions to his defence, Leighton Baines shouted in pain after a late tackle. Jack Wilshere’s conversation with referee Sousa after he had been denied a blatant penalty following a foul by Havard Nordtveit is probably best left unrecorded, though. It wasn’t the worst England performance, but it was not much to get excited about and the anaemic atmosphere was a burden. We are used, even in difficult times, to decent crowds at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Seeing it like this, the top tier all but closed, Club Wembley even emptier than usual, the lower tier full but strangely unmoved, gave the whole event an empty, unsatisfying air. Turning point: Sterling was brought down by Omar Elabdellaoui midway through the second half to win England a penalty . Power and placement: Captain Rooney smashed home the penalty past Norway goalkeeper Orjan Nyland in the 68th minute . VIDEO Rooney looks to spearhead England revival . Looking up: The Manchester United striker looks to the heavens after scoring from the penalty spot at Wembley . Done for the day: Rooney leaves the field with 20 minutes to play and is replaced by Danny Welbeck - who joined Arsenal for £16m on transfer deadline day . Well played, captain: Rooney shakes hands with manager Roy Hodgson after being substituted at Wembley . For the television viewer there would have been considerably more tension during the Great British Bake Off on BBC2, certainly if somebody’s ice cream got left on the formica top by mistake again. Norway were not tame opponents, they were certainly well organised, but Switzerland will have a lot more about them going forward, particularly at home. Nevertheless, Hart was forced into a superb save from Joshua King after 50 minutes and was almost caught out when Per Ciljan Skjelbred struck a cross from the right in the first half. Hart scrambled back a couple of steps, but failed to take the ball cleanly, only gathering it at the second attempt. It would have been a thoroughly depressing moment had that gone in, and a defeat in Basle could still turn apathy into mutiny back home. England had the best chances of the first half, mostly created by Sterling who put in Sturridge twice, plus Baines, without success. It was, in essence, a repeat of the issues at the World Cup; England had the possession and the opportunities but lacked the touch of class required to convert them. It is a long road back from here, and not much scenery either.","Wayne Rooney scored from penalty spot in 68th minute at Wembley .

"Fears are growing that Kell Brook's boxing career will have to be put on hold, at the very least, after being stabbed in the leg in Tenerife. Brook is now 'stable and sitting up in bed', according to his promoter Eddie Hearn, who has flown to the hospital bedside of Britain's newest world champion as doctors begin assessing the full extent of the damage. There is little or no chance of Brook making a first defence of his IBF welterweight title as scheduled in his home city of Sheffield on December 6. VIDEO Scroll down for Kell Brook gives immediate reaction to IBF world title win . On the mend: Kell Brook puts on a brave face in hospital in Tenerife after being stabbed in the leg . Support: Promoter Eddie Hearn (right) poses with his fighter Brook after flying to Tenerife to visit him . Recovery: Brook is in a stable condition in hospital after being attacked in the early hours of Thursday . Champion: The Sheffield fighter won a world title at the first time of asking after beating Shawn Porter . In action: Brook turned in a gutsy display to beat Porter and line up a potential fight against Amir Khan . Kell Brook's career-defining victory over Shawn Porter in Los Angeles last month finally proved what he'd always insisted, that he could mix it with the worlds best. The Sheffield star had won 32 fights as a professional before earning his shot at the IBF welterweight title, a journey that had more than it's fair share of roadblocks. Brook was the mandatory challenger to the great Manny Pacquiao as far back as 2010 but instead had to bide his time. A switch to promoter Eddie Hearn saw an upturn in his fortunes as he progressed from fighting in leisure centres to filling out arenas. Victory over Hector Saldivia two years ago manoeuvred him into position to fight then champion Devon Alexander but injuries to both men saw the fight postponed three times and eventually cancelled. Instead, he faced the undefeated Porter, outpointing the champion to become the sixth Brit to hold a world title in the division and the first since Ricky Hatton's brief stint in 2006. That victory should catapult him into the realm of mega-fights with a domestic dust-up with bitter British rival Amir Khan on the cards for next year. Martin Domin . If, as suspected, there is muscle and trauma damage as well as the blood loss which required substantial transfusion, the worst case scenario is that he could miss out on a projected mega-money Wembley Stadium spectacular with Amir Khan next year. Hearn told Sportsmail on Friday: 'I can confirm he has a leg injury but there is no injury to his arm. He is stable and sitting up in bed, with his family and myself at his bedside. 'I have not yet spoken to his doctors so I can't comment on the severity of the issues, but I will be making a statement later today.' Hearn was unable to comment on a tweet purporting to be from the Brook family that claimed the boxerunderwent 'a major operation that saved his life'. Brook is understood to have been on a night out in Golf De Sur with his heavily pregnant partner, Lindsey, who left early and was not present when the altercation occurred. He is said to have met up with friends after parting company with his girlfriend, before heading back to Las Adalfas in the early hours. It is believed he may have spent time with his attacker on the night of the incident. Onlookers at the scene, close to the Golf De Sur resort in southern Tenerife, have described a trail of blood from an apartment at the Las Adalfas complex, to a second apartment where Brook is understood to have attempted to gain entry by smashing a patio window. Brook is being treated at Candelaria hospital and police remain at scene of both the scene of the attack . Pictures of blood splattered on the concrete which are said to be connected to the stabbing of Kell Brook . Flying the flag: Brook is an attractive opponent for Amir Khan having upset the odds to beat Porter in LA . In training: British boxer Brook, pictured in 2010, enjoys a run in his hometown of Sheffield . Rising: Brook is unbeaten in 33 fights. He was scheduled to return to the ring in December, but that's in doubt . Plans for Brook to travel to Las Vegas next week to be at ringside for Floyd Mayweather's rematch with Marcos Maidaina have been scrapped already. This is not the first time Brook has been stabbed as the result of a late night altercation. Following the first incident, in Sheffield seven years ago, he was out of action for six months. It will be deeply unfortunate for Brook if these latest wounds jeopardise his career, at 28, just as he is about to cash in on his unbeaten career. His battling, against-the-odds victory over Shawn Porter in America a fortnight ago finally made him a world champion and extended his record to 33 straight wins.","The IBF  world champion is in a stable condition in Candelaria hospital .

"North Koreans were treated to a exhibition of pro wrestling during a special two-day festival organised by a Japanese member of parliament. The bizarre event is part of a warming of relations between Japan and the hermit state run by Kim Jong Un. Some 15,000 residents packed the stadium to watch the show which featured to American wrestlers, one of whom was previously a pro American Footballer with the Minnesota VIkings and Chicago Bears.

Some 15,000 North Koreans packed the arena for the biggest international sporting event of the summer . The event was the first pro wrestling show in North Korea for 20 years. It was the first major sporting event with foreign 'stars' since Dennis Rodman and a group of former NBA basketball players staged a game in January for Kim Jong Un's birthday. The trip was organised by former Japense wrestler Kanji 'Antonio' Inoki, who is also a member of parliament. He claimed the event will help promote further exchanges with North Korea. However, Jang Ung, member of the International Olympic Committee and the North Korean organiser for the event used his opening remarks to attack the United States and South Korea. Jang claimed that President Obama was using military exercises in South Korea as a prelude to a nuclear attack on North Korea. The United States rejected that interpretation, claiming the exercises were purely defensive. When Americans Bob 'The Beast' Sapp and Jon Andersen took to the ring, the crowd of about 15,000 didn't seem to know how to respond. 'It was real eerie and a little scary at first,' said Sapp, who briefly played for the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears before becoming a celebrity in Japan as a mixed martial artist.

"Prisoners are earning £20 a week phoning householders and quizzing them about their valuables. Burglars and other criminals are asking unsuspecting families if they would like to save money on their home insurance. The inmates get paid to read from a script which includes asking potential customers their names and postcodes. 'Contained': A G4S spokesman said that the incident at HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton, had been contained . They also inquire about the total value of their possessions – including details of any worth large sums. The scheme, which was launched two months ago, has been introduced at HMP Oakwood, near Wolverhampton, and Drake Hall women’s prison in Eccleshall, Staffordshire. The prisoners say they are ringing up on behalf of a market research company and do not reveal they are calling from behind bars. Last night a horrified source said: ‘This may have put hundreds of homes’ security at risk.’ In March 2009, Drake Hall (left) was re-designated from a semi-open women's jail to a closed prison. Labour MP Keith Vaz (right) said: 'This is not work prisoners should be involved in' A Ministry of Justice spokesman confirmed the controversial scheme was operating. Unsuspecting families are being asked by burglars and other criminals if they would like to save money on their home insurance (file picture) He said: ‘We do not want prisoners sitting idle in their cells when they should be working towards their rehabilitation. ‘We . prepare offenders for work inside prison so they can get a job after . release – this reduces the chances that they will reoffend in the . future, meaning lower crime and fewer victims. ‘All . prisoners working in call centres are risk-assessed and stringent . security measures are in place, with calls supervised and recorded.’ The spokesman said the full address . details were not made available to the prisoners and they did not take a . pen into the call room so they could not write any details down. He . also stressed that the computers the prisoners use do not have access . to the internet. The inmates wear telephone headsets as they sit at the . specially prepared jail call centres. They phone homeowners using a . script. A source said: ‘When they get through, they are told to ask, “Would you like to save some money?” Most customers say yes. ‘They then ask to confirm names and postcode, enough to identify where they live, and if they have valuable items.’ Last night Peter Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Trusting criminals with people’s financial details is incredibly naive. Prisoners walk into a prepared call centre inside the jail and are given a headseat. They sit down at an 'isolated' computer which has no internet access - and they are not allowed to bring in any writing implements. They use a script to call homeowners and ask them to confirm their names and postcodes - but are not given the person's full address. They also inquire about the total value of their possessions and ask homeowners if they would like to save money on their home insurance. 'Burglars will know who to target when they are released.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz said: ‘This is not work prisoners should be involved in.’ In March 2009, Drake Hall was re-designated from a semi-open women’s jail to a closed prison. Last month, HMP Oakwood was one of two privately-run prisons the Ministry of Justice had ‘serious concerns’ over. The jail, run by G4S, was given the lowest performance rating of one. Concerns over soft justice surfaced again last week when two violent thugs at another jail were caught boasting of their easy prison life on Facebook as they posed next to their television and games console in their cell.","Inmates read script which sees them ask for names and postcodes .

"Portugal may have been without superstar Cristiano Ronaldo but it was not less of a shock as they slumped to an embarrassing 1-0 defeat at home to Albania in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier. After a miserable World Cup campaign, which saw them bow out in the group phase, the hosts failed to bounce back as stunning volley from Bekim Balaj early in the second half decided the match. Even without Ronaldo the likes of Fabio Coentrao and Nani - who was the provider of their most encouraging moments - lined up for Portugal in the Group I clash, but couldn't muster a response. Nani, on loan at Sporting Lisbon from Manchester United, whipped in a number of dangerous crosses and fired wide from inside the area as his side took the ascendancy without converting.

The home fans were silenced by a moment of magic seven minutes into the second half when Odise Roshi's cross from the right came in behind Balaj, who impressively rifled a right-footed volley on the turn into the bottom corner from 15 yards. Ricardo Horta hit the post, Nani headed over from close range and Coentrao had a shot fumbled by Berisha, who also tipped over a shot from Andre Gomes, as Portugal chased the game and Albania held on. Perhaps an even greater shock was averted when Finland went 1-0 down to the Faroe Islands when Christian Holst found the back of the net just before half-time in their Group F meeting. Rosenborg striker Riku Riski came to the rescue though, first to equalise and then secure the lead before Roman Eremenko put the result beyond doubt late on.

"Real Madrid were shocking in pink in San Sebastian on Sunday night as they were beaten 4-2 by Real Sociedad. Just 100 days after their Champions League triumph, the balance of the team that won the club its 10th European Cup looks to have been seriously upset by the sale of Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso. Supporters will now be asking why they have signed Manchester United substitute Javier Hernandez and not the Monaco striker Radamel Falcao they were craving. VIDEO Scroll down to watch rested Cristiano Ronaldo crowned best player in Europe . Lost: Real Madrid tasted a 4-2 defeat at the hands of Real Sociedad on Sunday and their fans will have big questions to ask of Carlo Ancelotti . Frustrated: James Rodriguez reacts during the defeat to Sociedad, which was Real's first of the La Liga season, after Ancelotti's men won their first last week . Real Sociedad: Zubikarai, Zaldua, Elustondo, I Martinez, De La Bella, Bergara, Granero, Prieto (Gonzalez 83), Zurutuza, Castro (Canales 59), Agirretxe (Vela 59) Subs (not used): Bardaji, Martinez, Pardo, Berchiche .

Subs (not used): Navas, Varane,  Nacho, Illarramendi, De Tomas . Bookings: Carvajal, Isco . Goals:  Ramos (6), Bale (11) Karim Benzema, who many supporters wanted replaced by the Colombian, was poor in this embarrassing defeat but he was not alone as Madrid looked shaky at the back, slow in midfield, and uninspired in attack. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas said: 'After 15 minutes we thought the victory was ours but in the end it was a horrible performance from us and we have to learn from this. 'We have a very important badge on our shirts and we have to honour that. We have all been guilty tonight. It was not just the defensive performance the whole team has to be held responsible.' Before the nightmare last hour of the game, Ancelotti's side dominated. It took them just six minutes to take the lead with Toni Kroos's perfect corner planted on to the head of Sergio Ramos, who thundered it past Enaut Zubikarai. Ramos nearly doubled his tally, and Real Madrid's lead, on nine minutes when he hit the cross-bar with a free-kick from the edge of the area. It was a let-off for the home side but there was no respite as Bale made it two from Modric's pass. The quick nutmeg of hapless Sociedad defender Gorka Elustondo was magical and the quick left-footed finish lethal. Real Sociedad were all at sea and they should have been lost without trace before half-time but Real let them back into the game with some woeful finishing and some terrible defending. Benzema might have headed in a third when an awful back pass from David Zurutuzu put the Frenchman through on the keeper but as the two challenged for the ball Zubiakarai did enough to prevent the striker making contact. Isco then got to the byline and dragged the centre back to Marcelo whose first time shot was palmed away by Zubikarai. Ramos then headed over from a corner with what could have been goal number five in the first 25 minutes. Strike: Gareth Bale puts Real Madrid 2-0 up in the 11th minute after a cheeky nutmeg and tidy finish with the left boot into the far-right corner of the goal . Better times: Bale and Co thought they were cruising in Sociedad - and they were - until the home side took control towards the end of the opening half . Who needs Ronaldo? Cristiano was missed in the end by the Madrid club as they fell to their first defeat of the La Liga season after winning their first last week . Former QPR midfielder Granero finally gave Real Sociedad's supporters something do other than whistle their own side when his vicious shot was blocked acrobatically by Ramos on the edge of the six-yard box. Carvajal then jumped clumsily into Zurutuzu and the referee could easily have pointed to the spot. It was the start of a poor period of play from Real Madrid's right-back and it was the key to Real Sociedad's revival. He was beaten by Xabi Prieto in the air with the midfielder flicking on a corner that reached Inigo Martinez at the back post. The defender swept in unmarked and with Ramos spectating he pulled a goal back. Carvajal was again at fault when incredibly the home side were back on level terms. He failed to get close enough to Alberto De la Bella and the left back had time and space to send over the perfect cross for Zurutuzu to head home. Thanks: Inigo Martinez (pictured) brought Sociedad back into the game at 2-1 with his simple tap-in at the back post after a flick at the front from Xabi Prieto . Hard to take: Sergio Ramos on his knees during the 4-2 defeat as Real struggled to take charge over Sociedad in the second half after a more promising first 45 minutes . Real could have been behind as early as minute three of the second half but Imanol Agirretxe headed well wide from close range with only Casillas to beat. Real Madrid were desperately missing the running of Di Maria and the oragnisation of Xabi Alonso with their midfield too easily bypassed by Real Sociedad's. Defender Pepe was seen screaming at the quartet of Isco Kroos, new £75million man James Rodriguez and Modric to play closer to the back four but the warnings were not heeded and soon Real Sociedad had the lead. On 66 minutes it was a former Real player who helped inflict the killer blow. Sergio Canales had come on as a sub along with former Arsenal stirker Carlos Vela. He turned away from Ramos and crossed to the edge of the six-yard box. Zurutuzu got to the ball first ahead of Carvajal to smash it high into Casillas' net. With 15 minutes left Vela controlled the ball with his arm inside the penalty area and when the whistle did not go, he gleefully rifled the ball past Casillas to make it 4-2. Ancelotti reacted by taking off Carvajal and brining on Arbeloa – hardly the sort of change that was going to get Real back into the game but with Ronaldo injured the visitiors had no forwards on the bench. Manchester United striker Hernandez is being brought in for exactly that reason. Impact from the bench will be his job description, on Sunday night in San Sebastian that was needed more than ever. The game had started as a must-win match for Real Sociedad manager Jagoba Arrasate it ended with the dark clouds of doubt gathering of Ancelotti who must sort the mess out quickly before the Madrid derby and the start of the Champions League after the international break. Celebration: Sociedad emerged 4-2 victors over Real Madrid on their home turf but were not expected to do so with the likes of Rodriguez, Bale and Co still on show . Gutted: Marcelo gestures during the 4-2 loss as Real failed to light up the La Liga match without the rested Ronaldo, who is regaining his match fitness .","Real Madrid let two-goal lead slip in San Sebastian as Real Sociedad emerge 4-2 victors in La Liga clash .

"A yoga teacher may have been sacked by her jealous ex-Playboy Playmate boss for being 'too cute' but that's not grounds for a gender discrimination lawsuit, the centerfold's lawyer said today. Manhattan instructor Dilek Edwards is suing former nude model Stephanie Adams and her husband Charles Nicolai for sacking her last year over her good looks. But in papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court today, the couple's lawyer Douglas Wigdor contends the gender discrimination lawsuit should be tossed because people can't be legally discriminated against for 'attractiveness'. Lawsuit: Yoga teacher Dilek Edwards (left) has accused former playmate Stephanie Adams (right) of firing her because she was 'too cute' to be around her chiropractor husband . 'Gender discrimination': Yoga teacher Dilek Edwards claims she was fired last year from the Wall Street . chiropractic clinic that Stephanie Adams (right) owns . with her doctor husband, Charles Nicolai (left) New York Daily News reported that court documents showed Edwards was fired out of jealousy. However the paper also said that Wigdor denied that claim in court today but said, if that was the reason, it would not amount to gender discrimination or sexual harassment. Edwards, 32, claims she went to work with Adams’ husband in April 2012, providing yoga and massage therapy services at the couple's Wall Street Chiropractic and Wellness clinic. She said she had a 'strictly cordial and professional' relationship with Nicolai. However, she claimed he had warned her in June that his wife 'might become jealous' after . she gave him yoga-therapy sessions to help with chronic pain, telling . her 'it had to be a secret'. On October 30, Edwards said that she . got a 'frantic' text at 1.31 a.m. from Adams that said, 'You are NOT . welcome any longer at Wall Street Chiropractic, DO NOT ever step foot in . there again, and stay the f*** away from my husband and family.' 'And remember I warned you,' Adams allegedly said, according to the New York Post. Fighting the claims: Lawyer Douglas Wigdor (left) contends his client Stephanie Adams (right) did not discriminate against Dilek Edwards based on her looks . Session: Dilek leads a class in downtown Manhattan - which is where she worked for Wall Street Chiropractic . Adams, . 43, who became the first openly lesbian Playmate after being featured . as Miss November in 1992, dismissed Edwards' claims as nonsense, saying, . 'No disrespect to anyone - but I'm a centerfold.' The yoga teacher is seeking unspecified damages, alleging sexual harassment, gender discrimination and unlawful termination. Former Playboy centerfold Adams still identifies with the LGBT community, despite having a son with Nicolai. She has also in the past claimed to be a 'direct descendant' of Presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. 'I can only imagine they’re rolling over in their graves because of the outrageous behavior of their purported descendant,' said Edwards’ lawyer, Maimon Kirschenbaum. In 2012, Adams won $1.2 million from New York City because she was arrested in 2006 for allegedly threatening to shoot a cab driver with a gun. It was proven that Adams couldn't have been carrying a gun because she was wearing skin tight clothing.","Dilek Edwards, 32, suing playmate Stephanie Adams and her husband Charles Nicolai .

"Bernard Hopkins insists the reason he chose to fight feared knockout artist Sergey Kovalev is because he only wants to take on the very best. The reigning WBA and IBF light-heavyweight world champion faces the Russian ace and current WBO belt-holder Kovalev in a mouth-watering unification clash on Saturday night. Taking place at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, the Philadelphian veteran, who is remarkably just two months shy of his 50th birthday, says he is from an era where the best fight the best. Bernard Hopkins performs during an open training session ahead of his fight against Sergey Kovalev . Hopkins is bidding to unify three light-heavyweight world titles two months ahead of his 50th birthday . Hopkins insists he wants to face the best in the division, hence his decision to take on Kovalev . 'I want the best. Hagler fought the best. Ray Leonard fought the best. The Alis of the world, they fought the best. I'm from the era where I fought the best and that's important to me,' said Hopkins. 'I've been in the game for almost three decades. I look for more of what a guy brings to a gunfight other than bullets. The sweet science is not based on only one thing you can do particularly well. 'There's no fighter I wouldn't put my record up against in this era, in any class. I put the work in to have the track record and be taken seriously. Come November 8 you get to watch artwork. You're watching Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong with gloves on,'. But the unbeaten Kovalev has been dubbed 'Krusher' for a reason having amassed a formidable 23 knockouts from his 25 wins. The future Hall of Fame fighter Hopkins, however, is well aware of the threat that Kovalev possesses and has called on observers, who are tipping Kovalev to win, not to go back on their words after the fight. 'I have the same thoughts on Kovalev that most people do. He's a dangerous puncher, he has an over 90 percent knockout rate and anyone who fights this guy has the opportunity to not be the same,' added Hopkins. 'Kovalev is a threat to anybody. It won't be an easy fight, even if it looks easy to you. I don't just have to beat the man, but I have to beat a lot of people. They're either going to watch me win or watch me lose, and I don't mind playing that game. Kovalev has a frightening knockout percentage and has blazed his way through the division . Kovalev stretches off after a training session as he bids to protect his unbeaten record . Kovalev won his world title by knocking out Nathan Cleverly in Wales last year in devastating fashion . 'I don't believe in luck, I believe in whoever brings the best of themselves and whoever sacrifices will win. We won't take anything away from this guy because he's real, but on Nov. 9 we don't want anyone saying what they aren't saying now.' The oldest world champion in boxing history at 49-years-old also believes that there will unlikely be another fighter who is able to defy Father Time as he has, and has urged fans to enjoy him while they can. 'This is nothing to sneeze at, that's the main thing, but just being able to be around as long as I've been and still fresh as a daisy, I believe, and I'll prove it November 8th, there's no definition really behind it. 'Just enjoy it, understand it, and realise that you might not be alive to see it again,' he said. The 31-year-old Kovalev, who won his first world title by knocking out Nathan Cleverly last year, is adamant that he is going to do the same demolition job on Hopkins when they get into the ring,. 'Bernard talks and fights. I just fight,' he said 'I don't know what I'm going to do. I go into the ring and I get my victory at any cost. If I need to fight, I will fight. If I need to box, I'm going to box. I don't have any strategy for the fight, just to go into the ring and fight like a street fight. I'm going to kick his ass because he's my opponent. 'I always have bullets in my arsenal. My hands are my weapons. It's my weapon in the ring. Hopkins thinks that I only have two bullets but I will bring some more.'

"Oxford took West Brom all the way to penalties before the Premier League side prevailed 7-6 to reach the third round of the Capital One Cup. Australian defender Jason Davidson scored the winning spot-kick after Oxford captain Jake Wright had seen his effort saved by Boaz Myhill. The Baggies, with seven changes from the side that started against Southampton at the weekend, looked lively early on and made the breakthrough just before the half hour mark through Jonny Mullins' own goal. VIDEO Scroll down for Alan Irvine reassures West Brom of his coaching credentials . Relief: Jason Davidson celebrates scoring the winning penalty as West Brom eventually scraped through . West Brom: Myhill, Wisdom, McAuley, Dawson, Davidson, Baird, Brunt, Sessegnon, Berahino, Yacob, Ideye. Subs: Foster, Olsson, Morrison, Gamboa, O'Neil, Mulumbu, Roofe. Oxford Utd: Crocombe, Rose, Mullins, Wright, Newey, Collins, Riley, Brown, Ruffels, Hylton, Morris. Subs: Hoskins, Jakubiak, Meades, Raynes, Potter, Hunt, Stephens. Referee: James Adcock (Nottinghamshire) However, their performance lacked urgency thereafter as they toiled to find the second goal that would have made for a more comfortable evening. Oxford tried to take advantage of labouring Albion and improved after half-time. But it was no surprise to see a team who have lost all four of their League Two matches this season, scoring only one goal, struggle to create a clear-cut opportunity. It looked like Mullins' misfortune would be enough to see West Brom sneak through but Danny Hylton headed the equalising goal with four minutes remaining. Oxford could have nicked it in extra-time before they found themselves hanging on after Junior Brown's red card. Oxford almost made the worst possible start when Chris Brunt got across his marker at the near post to chest the ball goalwards. Max Crocombe nervously fumbled but kept it out and then gathered at the second attempt. Shortly afterwards Joe Riley's last-ditch tackle denied Saido Berahino after recent signing Brown Ideye, making his full debut, had put the England Under-21 international through on goal with a nicely weighted pass. No way through: Stephane Sessengnon was part of a strong West Brom side that couldn't win in normal time . Unlucky: Saido Berahino and Brown Ideye  look on as the ball is deflected off Johnny Mullins for own goal . There was a scare for West Brom when Josh Ruffles' shot deflected narrowly wide, but the Baggies were soon putting the visitors under pressure again. Crocombe spilled Brunt's cross but Ideye flicked the ball over his shoulder - and the crossbar. The young keeper got away with another moment of nerves midway through the first half when Stephane Sessegnon's 25-yarder bounced from his grasp but Oxford's good fortune was about to run out. Andre Wisdom's low cross from the right looked harmless but the ball struck Mullins on the leg eight yards out and bounced into the bottom corner of the net. As like the start of the match, Oxford were nearly caught out at the beginning of the second half. However, Ideye failed to connect with Wisdom's low cross with the goal gaping and the League Two side escaped. Setback: West Brom players look dejected as an 86th minutes goal leaves them needing to play 120 minutes . Claudio Yacob then spurned a chance to extend the lead but he headed straight at Crocombe when unmarked at the far post. Oxford enjoyed their first successful spell of the game as the midway-point of the second-half approached. Gareth McAuley made a sliding block inside his penalty area to prevent Ruffles from having a clear sight of goal, before West Brom were carved open down the right and Carlton Morris shot wide of the far post. Wisdom then had to block Hylton's goalbound effort. It was beginning to look like Oxford's chance had passed them by but with four minutes remaining a long, diagonal ball into the box was headed back across goal by substitute Will Hoskins and Hylton nodded it over the line from a yard out to send the tie into extra time. Decisive: Boaz Myhil makes his second save of the shoot out from Oxford captain Jake Wright to win the game . Yet again West Brom had an early chance when play restarted as James Morrison's 15-yard shot was deflected just wide. But Oxford, tails up after the equaliser, almost went ahead when Myhill spilled a cross but Craig Dawson did brilliantly to scramble the ball away. Myhill then made amends with a good block to deny Brown. Brown was sent off midway through the second period of extra-time when he hacked down Dawson but Oxford held on to take it to penalties, surviving a late scare as Dawson headed what he thought was the winning goal only for the referee to rule it out for a push. West Brom must have feared the worst when Morrison and Ideye missed but Myhill saved Michael Collins' and Tom Newey's spot-kicks as it stood at 3-3 after five penalties each. Each side netted three in a row before Myhill saved Wright's effort and Davidson held his nerve to send Albion into round three for the first time since 2011.","West Brom go ahead after 29 mins through Johnny Mullins own goal .

"Battle: Jennifer Wederell died at the age of 27 from lung cancer. She had a transplant to try and save her from cystic fibrosis . She delayed her wedding for two years while she waited for a lung transplant to save her from the cystic fibrosis that had claimed her brother’s life. The operation was a success, and last autumn an overjoyed Jennifer Wederell walked down the aisle to marry her boyfriend of four years, David. Less than a year later, Mrs Wederell was dead, killed by cancer which her family are certain came from the donated lungs – which they found out, too late, had belonged to a 20-a-day smoker. Mr Wederell says there is no way that his wife, who died in August at the age of 27, would ever have agreed to the transplant had she known the lungs came from a smoker. Along with his wife’s parents, Mr Wederell, 28, is now campaigning for more non-smokers to register as organ donors, to prevent other families going through the same agony. While it is easy to assume that only pristine organs are used in transplants, a severe shortage of donors means that almost 40 per cent of lungs used in the operations come from donors who have smoked. Research shows that a seriously ill patient is much more likely to die from turning down a transplant than from accepting lungs donated by a smoker. Essex-born Mrs Wederell was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of two. The disease, in which the lungs and digestive system become clogged with thick, sticky mucus, is hereditary. It claimed the life of her older brother, Richard Grannell, when he was just 23. Mrs Wederell met her future husband through friends in 2007. By the time they got engaged in 2009, her health had deteriorated badly and the couple decided to delay the wedding in the hope she would get a transplant. After an 18-month wait, she was told in April of last year that a pair of lungs were available. She gave her consent to the transplant after a doctor ran through the risks. A few weeks before her operation, . transplant guidelines had been revised to say that patients should be . informed if their new lungs carried a higher than normal risk of cancer. Celebration: Jennifer with husband Dave and close family members following their wedding in Autumn 2011. The couple had delayed the ceremony by two years while she waited for the transplant . Write caption here . But Mrs Wederell was treated under the previous rules, and was not told that the lungs had come from a 20-a-day smoker. Mr Wederell, who works in IT, told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘That would have been the time to say, “The donor was a smoker, therefore there is a higher risk of malignancy. Do you want to go ahead or not?” ‘They didn’t mention it. If they had, she would have said no.’ The transplant, which was carried out at . the Harefield Hospital in Uxbridge, West London, appeared to be a . success and the couple married a few months later. Mr Wederell said: . ‘Weddings are always happy but this was something else. Love: David and Jennifer were engaged in July 2009. Prior to the proposal David sought permission from Jennifer's father who made sure David understood exactly what this commitment meant . In this picture (left) from 2007, Jennifer showed her own daily routine of medication . A few months later, however, her happiness was shattered when she was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was only then that she was told her new lungs had belonged to a smoker. Mr Wederell is adamant that they were the source of the cancer. She died at home in Hawkwell, Essex, on August 24. Her father, Colin Grannell, 57, said: ‘Yes, she had a fantastic wedding day but her death was horrible. ‘I would have given up the good times not to see her die like that.’ (Left) Jennifer as a proud bridesmaid for the first time aged 11-years-old in 1996. (Right) Aged two, when her condition was diagnosed . Along with his wife and son-in-law, Mr Grannell has now set up a Facebook page called Jennifer’s Choice to encourage more non-smokers to register as organ donors. Mr Grannell says he wants those who have waited years for a transplant to have the choice his daughter never had. He told the Daily Mail: ‘All we want is to give Jennifer what she would have wanted. People need to be given more information. There must be more choice and more transparency.’ The Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust said it extended its sincere condolences to the family. A spokesman added that while it was ‘very rare’ for patients to specify they do not want lungs from smokers, Mrs Wederell should have had the choice. He said that research shows that a patient’s chance of survival is higher if they receive a smoker’s lungs than if they remain on the waiting list for a transplant from a donor with no history of smoking. He added: ‘Regrettably, the number of lungs available for transplantation would fall by 40 per cent if there was a policy of refusing those which have come from a smoker; waiting lists would increase and many more patients would die without a transplant.’ NHS Blood and Transplant, which runs the organ donor register, said that all organs are examined at least twice before being transplanted and although the risks are very small, they are impossible to eliminate.","Jennifer Wederell was given the lungs of a 20-a-day smoker .

"Television networks in the Middle East have started showing a Looney Tunes-style cartoon poking fun at militant Islamists fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The satirical animation mocks the jihadists' radical ideas and portrays the group as narcissistic, deluded and obsessed with a literal interpretation of Islam that forces them go to ridiculous lengths to ensure they do not use any item that wasn't available in the 7th Century. ISIS fighters, who rebranded as the Islamic State earlier this year after declaring the establishment of a caliphate in the large swaths of the Middle East under their control, have themselves repeatedly created slick recruitment videos to spread their radical message. Last week the group, whose campaign of mass shootings and beheadings have been condemned as too extreme even by notorious terrorist organisation al-Qaeda, were described by David Cameron as a 'greater and deeper threat' to international security than had been known in recent times. Satire: The Looney Tunes-style cartoon depicts a hapless young ISIS militant struggling to carry out simple tasks - first dropping a rocket launcher on to the foot of his commander before accidentally shooting him . Ridicule: The cartoon is just one of many Middle Eastern comedy shows to challenge and undermine ISIS' radical interpretation of Islam. The shows all aim to make the militants (pictured) look ridiculous . In response to the Islamic State's campaign of terror in Syria and Iraq, television networks throughout the Middle East have embraced cartoons and comedy to ridicule the group's radical views. Satire has long been a powerful force in Arab culture, where direct criticism of governments, religious institutions, wealthy individuals or powerful groups can be an incredibly dangerous practice. The Looney Tunes-style cartoon depicts a hapless young ISIS militant struggling to carry out simple tasks; first dropping a rocket launcher on to the foot of his commander before accidentally shooting him when he holds his weapon the wrong way round while firing towards an Iraq military checkpoint. The programme is just one of many being shown around the Middle East to mock ISIS and, although very few directly confront the group, they are all clearly intended to challenge and undermine their radical interpretation of Islam, and make the group look ridiculous in the eyes of potential recruits. 'These people are not a true . representation of Islam and so by mocking them. It is a way to show we are against them,' said Nabil Assaf - writer and producer on Lebanon's ISIS-mocking Ktir Salbe Show. 'Of course it's a sensitive issue, but this is one way to reject . extremism and make it so the people are not afraid,' he added. Animation: The Looney Tunes-style satirical cartoon mocks the jihadists' radical ideas and portrays the group as obsessed with a literal interpretation of 7th Century Islam that makes their lives needlessly difficult . Even the sickening videos of mass shootings conducted by ISIS (pictured) have become comedic fodder. Palestinian television channel al-Falastiniya aired a skit showing militants shooting Muslim civilians for their lack of piety, while simultaneously reminiscing about partying and meeting beautiful women while training . Satire has long been a force in Arab culture, beginning first with its ancient poetry. Indirect criticism once cloaked in self-censorship exploded out into the open during Arab Spring revolts. Even in the midst of Syria's bloody civil war, the country's black, satirical humor has continued - with ISIS finding itself challenged in a cultural war after its huge territorial gains. The top Islamic authority in Egypt recently began an online campaign asking journalists not to call the group an 'Islamic State', and comedians have followed suit. In one skit produced by the 'Ktir Salbe Show,' a taxi driver picks up a jihadi who rejects listening to radio because it didn't exist in the earliest days of Islam. The driver offers to turn on the air conditioning, but that too is rejected. The jihadist then criticizes the put-upon driver for answering his mobile phone. Fed up, the driver finally asks: 'Were there taxi cabs in the earliest days?'. 'No, 1,000 times no!' the passenger answers. The driver responds by kicking the jihadist out of his car and telling him to wait for a passing camel instead. Controversy: A cartoon on Iraq's al-Iraqiya channel depicts Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah (left), and accuses his Sunni kingdom of supporting ISIS - something Saudi officials have denied. Saudi Arabia does, however, back rebel forces fighting to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad (right) Response: ISIS has itself produced slick videos designed to spread its sickening message and encourage potential recruits to join the ranks. This particular clip featured three young British men . In Syria, comedic news programs also target the Islamic State group - although its presenters are forced to disguise themselves out of fears of retaliation. In . neighboring Iraq, an animated program on state television depicted a . slew of characters on the run from the Iraqi military, including young .

"The one-child policy in China can lead to an intensely close relationship between parents and offspring. This can make it difficult for parents to cut ties when their children move hundreds of miles away to start their first term in university . So when term starts children are not only personally delivered to their new university by their proud parents, but they often stay on for a few days to make sure their offspring have a friendly face to hand as they start their new lives as students. Parents of students at Shenyang Aerospace University in the city of Shenyang in north-eastern China sleep on the gym floor so that they can be near their offspring in the first few days of term . Shenyang Aerospace University's gymnasium was made available to 400 parents who were also given straw mats to sleep on . Many are from poor families who cannot afford the inflated hotel prices during the start of university term, and with the struggle to pay costs associated with sending their children to further education, a room is a luxury many are prepared to do without. As a result universities have now been increasingly turning some of the buildings over to parents who want to stay around for the first few days of their children's life.

"CLICK HERE for all the facts, stats and graphics from the Stadium of Light. The cavalry cannot come soon enough for Louis van Gaal and Manchester United. It is one point from six now, and a rather spawny one at that. Sunderland were the better team. Not just in terms of chances, but in the technical fields, too. They knew what they were about, they executed the manager’s plan, they were physically dominant. Their weakness, as ever, was in front of goal. Still, it was only as the game became ragged near the end that United looked dangerous. They are a shadow right now; a shadow of themselves, and of a team with Champions League ambitions. Heads up: Sunderland midfielder Jack Rodwell (third from right) rises highest to head his side back on level terms at the Stadium of Light . Unstoppable: Rodwell's header beats Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea (left) and finds the bottom corner to get Sunderland level . Pure passion: Former Manchester City man Rodwell grabs the Sunderland badge on his shirt after grabbing his first goal for the club .

Subs not used: Hernandez, Kagawa,  Amos, James. Booked: Young, Cleverley . Goals: Mata 17 . Referee: Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire) The result was an improvement on last week’s home defeat by Swansea City, but the performance was not. United have debilitating nerves at the back and the forwards are struggling to make the most of a pretty ordinary supply line. They weren’t outclassed by Sunderland, but in a pedestrian second half, the best chance fell to Gus Poyet’s team when Tyler Blackett blocked a Connor Wickham shot - after a bit of ball juggling - on its way to goal. That substitute Michael Keane had made a hash of a straight- forward defensive manoeuvre to allow the chance was par for the course. At the back, United are an accident waiting to happen these days. Marcos Rojo will be in the starting line-up soon — Van Gaal really cannot afford delay, once the red tape has been snipped - and maybe Angel Di Maria if United can pull off this summer’s marquee signing from Real Madrid. Whether an Argentinian winger solves the biggest problem here is doubtful, with a defensive overhaul so long overdue. Van Gaal may argue that invention is just as pressingly required, though. Vito Mannone, Sunderland’s goalkeeper, was rarely called into action and the best of it was a 50-50 with Ashley Young, which the Sunderland man won, impressively. Young had earlier been booked for diving, so not everything at United has changed since Sir Alex Ferguson left. The bottom-line problem for Van Gaal’s defence right now is this: whatever route to goal the opposition take, they look vulnerable. Ball in the air — vulnerable; ball down the flanks — certainly vulnerable; ball through the middle — vulnerable; half-assed misplaced pass that any League Two centre half would mop up in his sleep — surprisingly, still vulnerable. Sunderland soon worked out that their approaches to the United goal did not have to be of any grand quality. Get it up there and let United’s jitters do the rest. Easy finish: Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata (third from left) arrives at the back post to put his side 1-0 up after 17 minutes . Back of the net: Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone (left) looks dejected as Mata's shot nestles in his net during the first half .

Juan Mata's goal arrived after a neat passing move which began with goalkeeper David de Gea giving him the ball, as the graphic below shows - CLICK HERE for more in our brilliant Match Zone . Nor can the blame be laid solely on the 3-5-2 system. Defenders of this reputation — and expense — should not be exposed by what is one of the more common tactical variations. Van Gaal is probably mystified at the limitations of what is, with the exception of Luis Antonio Valencia at right wing-back, an English defence. It is no great surprise that Young looks as comfortable at left wing-back as he would sitting on a spike, but Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are England internationals, supposedly part of the national team’s rebuilding programme with youth at its heart. It is worrying to see them so devoid of confidence when faced with new ideas. Also missing is the certainty that accompanied a United opening goal. Time was, if this team took a single goal lead at Sunderland, victory could almost be presumed. Controversy: Van Persie (left) goes down in the Sunderland box after a joint tackle from Lee Cattermole (centre) and Santiago Vergini (right) Penalty? United winger Ashley Young was shown a yellow card for simulation after going down in the box after this challenge from Wes Brown .

Wayne Rooney spent most of his time on the ball on United's left side, as his Heat Map below shows - CLICK HERE for more stats and graphics in our Match Zone . On Sunday, when Juan Mata put United ahead against the run of play after 17 minutes, the presumption was of a Sunderland equaliser, most likely before half-time. In the end it took just 13 minutes. That the goal belonged to Jack Rodwell was another fillip for Poyet’s side. Attempting to rebuild his career after several wilderness years at Manchester City, Rodwell had a difficult debut against West Bromwich Albion last weekend. This was not greatly convincing, either, at first, but his equalising header changed that and, from there, his performance grew. By the time he was taken off after 63 minutes — match fitness is still an issue — he looked much more like his old Evertonian self. His goal was impressively taken, even if Manchester United’s marking left much to be desired — like, well, marking really. Sebastian Larsson whipped in the corner from the right and Rodwell lost Robin van Persie to rise high and give David de Gea no chance from close range. It was a clever run, almost stopping near the end, to trick the Dutchman, and Poyet’s reaction suggested he enjoyed it, too. He waved his arms furiously to encourage the crowd into making more noise. After United’s goal the stadium had fallen surprisingly quiet.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . No doubt that was due to the injustice of the scoreline. Until that moment it had been all Sunderland, United rarely venturing to the opposition penalty area. Then, from their first attack of note, a goal. Valencia sped down the right and hit a low cross which eluded Sunderland’s back line, and was tapped in by Mata at the far post. At first, it seemed as if Larsson might have got the final touch, but his despairing lunge was merely the act of a man over-compensating for losing his runner. No wonder the home fans stood nonplussed. They were probably wondering how United had reached this infant stage without conceding. As early as the second minute, a quite hopeless backpass by Young had almost allowed Wickham to put Steven Fletcher in, and three minutes later another defensive mess ended with Lee Cattermole shooting just wide. Will Buckley, making his full debut following a transfer from Poyet’s old club Brighton and Hove Albion, was giving Young a troubling time on the flank and in the 16th minute he set up what should have been a Sunderland goal. His break bamboozled three covering United players — not hard, there were times when one felt they could be taken in by the old penny-behind-the-ear gag — and he struck a perfect pass into the path of Wickham. His finish was dismal, however, straight at De Gea. The home fans seemed happy enough at the end, but they may one day come to view this as a missed opportunity. All the best individual performances were from the home team — Santiago Vergini exceptional, Cattermole breaking up play superbly — and if Sunderland had more about them around United’s box they would undoubtedly have won.

"You’ve heard of people who look like their pets, but how about people who look like their cars? According to a study our faces can bear a striking resemblance to the front of our vehicles. And this apparently means that our pets, in turn, also look like our cars. Researchers at University of Vienna say cars look like their owners (stock image shown). They found people could associate owners with the front of their vehicles. This follows similar research that says people perceive faces in the front of vehicles - known as pareidolia . The study was undertaken by University of Vienna psychologists Stefan Stiegar and Martin Voracek, reports Scientific American. It has long been said that dog owners look like their pets and it’s a subject that has left scientists bemused for years. But researchers say that the resemblance is no coincidence and found strangers can identify owners and their dogs with an 80 per cent accuracy - and the clue is in the eyes. Japanese psychologist Sadahiko Nakajima, of Kwansei Gakuin University in Japan, had been determined to resolve the idea after becoming doubtful over people’s belief that there is any likeness. He took pictures of dogs and their owners at a ‘dog lovers field festival’ before asking 502 students to look at two sets of test sheets of the 20 dog-owner pairs with their faces side by side – one sheet was a real pair while other was fake. They were also put into four different ‘masking’ situations where they were shown either the entire face or versions that had certain features covered, for example the eyes or the mouth. Participants were simply asked ‘choose the dog-owner pairs that physically resemble each other’. In the trial showing the full face, 80 per cent picked the correct pairing. The group that was only shown the dogs and owners with a panel covering the mouth scored 73 per cent. In the research they found that, when looked at from the front, cars seemed to resemble their owners. This follows similar research that says people perceive faces in the front of vehicles - known as pareidolia. ‘The initial idea was born as I was reading the article about “dogs do resemble their owners,”’ Stiegar tells MailOnline. ‘I thought, this could also replicate when using cars instead of dogs. This was some sort of everyday hypothesis because I frequently found that cars, to some extent, resemble their owners.’ In the study they rook 30 black and white photos of car owners and the front of their cars. One prerequisite though was that the owners had not been given the car as a gift, but had bought it for themselves. They then placed the real owner among images of several others who didn’t own the car, and they asked 160 participants to identify who was most likely to own the car on a scale of one to six (most to least likely). They found that people would assign particular traits to people and, more often than not, guessed correctly. ‘The real owner was in fact assigned rank 1 most frequently and rank 6 least frequently,’ the researchers write. However, they add that sex and age were not considered important factors, with the face being the main indicator. Think Katie Price (left) looks like the pink Range Rover she sold recently (right)? The study involved asking volunteers to look at a selection of people. One was the owner and the rest were not, with the volunteers selecting the right person more often than other options . Spoiler alert: One of the people here is the correct owner, while the other five are incorrect. Why not have a go at guessing who the right person is before you read more of this caption, as we'll reveal the answer at the end. If you guessed the man in the top left, you'd be correct . They proved this by repeating the test for volunteers but showing them the side or back of the car instead. This time they were much less accurate in their guesses, suggesting that the appearance of the front of the car as compared to faces was the most important factor. The results of the study suggest that people are buying cars that look like themselves. And in a further study, the psychologists repeated the research with dogs - and found the same results when they viewed cars from the fronts. There was one stipulation, however - they could only achieve this feat for purebeed dogs, and not mixed breeds. Of the overall research Stiegar said: ‘I was surprised, indeed. ‘This was the reason why we replicated it further two times. But what surprised me most was that the effect basically remained after controlling for possible stereotypes.’ This graph shows how a score of 1, most likely to own the car, was selected for the real owner more often than other options. The research goes on to say that dogs also look like their owner's car. The researchers ruled out other facts that might have influenced the study .","Researchers at University of Vienna say cars look like their owners .

"A helicopter that crashed in northeastern Pennsylvania was found Sunday along with the bodies of all five passengers, including one child. The helicopter plunged into a remote ravine near a wind farm in Noxen Township on Saturday night after the pilot told air traffic controllers he was losing altitude. Wyoming County coroner Thomas Kukuchka said the pilot contacted a nearby tower around 10:30 p.m. saying he would attempt to return to another airfield nearby. Tragedy: Five are dead, including one child, after a helicopter crashed into a remote Pennsylvania ravine . ‘That's when he went off radar,’ Kukuchka said. Although the names of those on board have not been released, Kukuchka said three men, a woman and a child were on board the Robinson 66 helicopter. ‘It appears to be a father and son, a father and daughter and the pilot,’ he said. Kukuchka did not release the ages of the victims. He said his office was trying to reach family members of the deceased in Leesburg, Virginia, Ellicot City, Maryland, and Kitnersville, Pennsylvania. Found: The helicopter went down Saturday. Here, local pilot Bobby Zampetti discusses aviation near the scene of the crash, which was located after a massive search Sunday . Search: Major William Schlosser of the Civil Air Patrol explained that search and rescue teams located the crash site using the helicopters emergency beacon and handheld radio devices . Route: The Robinson 66 helicopter took off Saturday from a small New York state airport en route to Lehighton, Pennsylvania. It went down sometime Saturday night in a ravine in Noxen Township, Pennsylvania . The Federal Aviation Administration said the helicopter took off from Greater Binghamton Airport in New York but officials there said it had actually originated at a smaller airfield nearby, Tri Cities Airport in Endicott. A phone message left at Tri Cities Airport was not immediately returned Sunday night. Search and rescue teams searched along the helicopter’s route through rugged Wyoming County using portable receivers to locate the helicopter using its emergency beacon, according to WNEP. ‘When an aircraft is in distress there is a beacon that gets set off, and we have receivers that can say it is to our left or to our right,’ Incident commander Major William Schlosser of the Civil Air Patrol told WNEP. Cause? The helicopter went down in a Noxen Township, Pennsylvania ravine on Saturday near this wind farm. Bad weather and poor visibility may have contributed to the crash . It was not clear if weather played a role in the crash, but Kukuchka said there were severe thunderstorms in the area Saturday night. The coroner and police said rough weather contributed to the difficulty of the search; the wreckage was located shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday. The FAA said the helicopter was bound for Jake Arner Memorial Airport in Lehighton. The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation, the FAA said.

"A brave young girl who has battled leukaemia since 2010 is set to enjoy her first Christmas without cancer in three years.

"Lewis Hamilton has revealed he felt awkward when rival Nico Rosberg was booed for the second successive race. After he was taunted at the Belgian Grand Prix following his crash with team-mate Hamilton, the boo boys were out in force again for Rosberg on Sunday. The German, who finished second behind Hamilton at the Italian Grand Prix, was jeered during his interview with former Ferrari driver Jean Alesi on the podium. Jeers: Championship leader Nico Rosberg was booed on the podium for the second successive race . Off track: Rosberg lost the lead of the race to Lewis Hamilton on lap 29 after his error at Turn One . ‘I felt a bit awkward when they were booing Nico,’ said Hamilton in the wake of his victory in Monza which sees him close the gap to Rosberg to 22 points in the drivers’ standings. ‘I don't like that in sport. After the race and when we get out of the car everyone should be nice to each other.’ Despite the strains of their title battle, which flared up last month in Spa after Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap, the 29-year-old Briton insists he remains on friendly terms with his team-mate. Straight on: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road after his costly error . Asked if they were friends again by Alesi, Hamilton replied: ‘Of course. We're team-mates, always will be.’ Hamilton’s latest remarks are in stark contrast to his comments after the Monaco Grand Prix in May in which he said he and Rosberg were 'not friends' but 'colleagues'. Hamilton was furious after he believed Rosberg had deliberately scuppered his final lap in qualifying by running off the road.","Rosberg was booed in the podium for the second successive race .

In it, he is heard remonstrating with one particular member of staff, whom he identified as a Muslim. With his hands in the air, the sales assistant is seen to shrug, saying: 'I'm not serving you, I'm not serving you.' Robinson, . who is due to stand trial next month for 'obstructing police' during a . march near where drummer Lee Rigby was slain in May this year, is heard . to ask him: 'So you won't serve my friend because he's friends with me . and I'm in the EDL?' He adds: 'He's nothing to do with me, and I've just gone and bought stuff over there.' A female member of staff then tells . Robinson that someone from the store's management team was coming to . sort the dispute out, before a large security guards intervenes and . makes Robinson stop filming.

"Charged: 18-year-old Amed Pelle has admitted inciting friends to riot via Facebook . A teenager who incited his 2,000 Facebook friends to riot was inspired by a violent cult film about gangs ruling the streets, a court heard yesterday. At one point he encouraged the killing of a million police officers. Amed Pelle, 18, sent three messages on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday following the outbreak of violence in his home city of Nottingham. The first two read: ‘Nottz Riot whose . onit?’ and ‘Kill one black youth, we kill a million Fedz [police], riot . til we own cities’. It . is believed the second message was a reference to Mark Duggan, whose . death in Tottenham last week sparked the original trouble. In . his third message, Pelle asked if friends wanted goods from a fashion . shop. He wrote: ‘Rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from Flannels?’ The . store, in the city centre, had its windows smashed hours later. Unemployed Pelle pleaded guilty at Nottingham magistrates’ court to a breach of section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007. He was remanded in custody for sentencing at the city’s crown court. Prosecutor John Wallis said Pelle told police that he had watched a film called Shank, in which gangs take over London, and that he ‘wanted the same to happen here’. The 2010 film depicted an apocalyptic future capital where gangs of youths rule the streets and carry out looting and wanton violence. Pelle, who is from Cuba, was arrested . after police officers spotted the messages while monitoring social . networking sites during the trouble in the city. Influence: Cult film Shank, which shows gangs taking over London, helped inspire Pelle's violent messages . Initially he claimed they were a joke, but his sinister intentions began to emerge during police interviews. Mr . Wallis told the court that Pelle, of Old Basford, admitted he ‘wanted . to see police stations damaged’, adding: ‘He didn’t want to get involved . in violence himself but wanted to encourage others to do so. ‘He . said he wanted police officers hurt, especially after the shooting [of . Mark Duggan] in London, because they always seem to pick on black . youths. ‘He wanted the riots to continue as a demonstration of black youth against the authorities and police.’ The hearing was told Pelle admitted that . among his 2,000 contacts were ‘old, violent, nasty gang friends’ from . the tough inner-city Radford district where he used to live. Damage: The violence in Nottingham was largely directed towards the police, such as this destroyed patrol car . Mr Wallis said Pelle claimed his father was a distant cousin of Mr Duggan’s uncle. Annelli Pritchard, defending, said: ‘He is 18 and, in my submission, somewhat naive. He did not realise the far-reaching consequences of putting these comments on Facebook. ‘He now fully appreciates the seriousness of the situation.’ Applying for bail, Miss Pritchard said Pelle, who has no previous convictions, had not personally participated in any rioting and his involvement was restricted to the Facebook messages. However, magistrates’ chairman Janet Ellis turned down the request, saying: ‘We consider the offence of encouraging violent disorder so serious that we feel our sentencing powers are insufficient for this matter to be dealt with in this court. ‘We feel there are substantial grounds, because of the nature and seriousness of the offence at a time of major unrest throughout the country, that there is a risk you could commit further offences.’ Pelle, who wore a white T-shirt and navy jogging bottoms, was handcuffed and led from the dock. Fire-bombed: A Nottingham police station was also targeted by rioters . Last night, neighbours spoke of their shock over his conviction. They said he comes from a religious family and was seen most Sundays going to church in a suit and carrying a Bible. One said: ‘He’s regarded as a good lad. He has a twin brother and an older brother and they are always laughing and joking. ‘I’m not aware of Amed causing any trouble. The family have lived here for a couple of years - there’s a mother living there, but I’m not sure about a father. ‘The family seem to go to church most Sundays. You see them walking there on a Sunday morning. The boys wear suits and they are carrying Bibles. ‘Their mother will be really hit hard by this. She’s the type of mum who tries to keep a good family.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Amed Pelle, 18, encouraged the killing of a million police officers, court hears .

"Fundraising site GoFundMe shut down a campaign supporting an Oklahoma cop accused of rape and stalking Tuesday in the face of criticism. Daniel Holtzclaw, 27, an Oklahoma City police officer, is behind bars at Oklahoma County Jail after being charged on multiple counts including rape by eight women. The fundraising page titled 'Justice for Daniel Holtzclaw' was set up by his sister Jenny on August 24 to help with his legal fees and states that Holtzclaw 'not only DESERVES but is required by the law to be given a Presumption of Innocence.' Scroll down for video . On the beat: Victims claimed Daniel Holtzclaw sexually assaulted them during traffic stops under threat of violence or arrest . The page gathered just over $7,000 but also attracted its share of critics, being shut down on Tuesday without an explanation from the company about what terms were violated. 'In the event that a campaign receives a high volume of complaints, GoFundMe will conduct an internal content review to determine the most appropriate course of action,' a spokesperson for GoFundMe told the Ann Arbor News. The company notably allowed two fundraising campaigns for officer Darren Wilson, who shot an unarmed teen in Ferguson, Missouri, to go forward. The campaigns have both stopped taking donations. The fight has moved over to the Facebook page set up for Holtzclaw, where the family has been 'deleting horrible comments,' it told CNN. The former college football player was put on administrative leave back in June after a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted during a traffic stop. According to the Daily News, the 57-year-old grandmother alleged that Holtzclaw ordered her to perform oral sex on him. Takedown: Holtzclaw is accused of sexual assault including forced oral sodomy, rape and stalking by at least eight women . Family: Holtzclaw's sister Jenny set up the GoFundMe page that has since been taken down, saying she received no explanation from the site . In the investigation that followed, Oklahoma City police located six other women, all African-American, that identified Holtzclaw in a array of offenses. An eighth woman came forward after his arrest. The Huffington Post reports Holtzclaw threatened arrest or physical harm against his alleged victims. According to Ann Arbor News, the judge originally ordered Holtzclaw held on a $5million bond, stating he conducted research on his victims before assaults. The bond was later reduced to $500,000. KOCO reports the investigation found Holtzclaw ran the names of victims shortly before the alleged assaults. Holtzclaw also ran the names the day after to see if the women reported him, according to investigators. On the 'Justice for Daniel Holtzclaw' Facebook pages, the family states 'the money that has been collected for Daniel’s defense is secure and we are currently exploring other options to use in order to aid in Daniel’s legal fees and bail' and that they're exploring other fundraising options. A post from September 3 on the Facebook page claimed the allegations against Holtzclaw are 'false.'","Daniel Holtzclaw, 27, is accused of rape, forced oral sodomy and stalking by at least eight women .

"After being buried beneath the sand dunes of Guadalupe, California, the monumental plaster sphinx from the movie The Ten Commandments has been unearthed. Those who wish to see the piece of movie history will be able to do so next year once it's been reconstructed, said the executive director of the Guadalupe Nipomo Dunes Center, Doug Jenzen. The weather-worn 15-foot-tall Sphinx no longer looks like it did when it was one of the 21 structures lining the Path to Pharaoh’s city in the silent classic directed by Cecil B. Demille, reports Live Science. Scroll down for video . Excavation: During its stint beneath the Guadalupe sand dunes, the giant sphinx was badly weathered due to the winds and associated erosion, necessitating a careful excavation and planned restoration . '[The 1923 film] was one of the largest movie sets ever made, because they didn't have special effects,' Jenzen told Live Science. 'So anything that they wanted to look large, they had to build large.' 'It's giant,' Jenzen said of Pharaoh’s city which stood 12 stories tall and about 720 feet across. Today what would be computer animated was built by hand in Los Angeles and then transported 156 miles Guadalupe where the film crew constructed the massive hollow statues. The Sphinxes are practically in the same spot they were during filming, said Jenzen. The urban legend is that when the movie shoot was over the crew dynamited the set and buried the sphinxes in a trench. Jenzen saw very little evidence of that. More likely, the sandy and windy climate buried the plaster beneath the sand. The film helped to guide an excavation of the buried movie treasure in 2012. 'We'd work during the day, and we'd watch the movie at night to figure out what we were finding,' said M. Colleen Hamilton, a historical archaeology program manager and senior historical archaeologist with Applied EarthWorks in California. The site has been excavated numerous times. The first unearthing occurred in 1990 when the Dunes Center had archaeologists dig around in the location of the movie site. Former Glory: Pictured here beside an actor in the movie classic The Ten Commandments are the majestic sphinxes as they stood in 1923 . They found tobacco tins and bottles with cough syrup that probably replaced alcohol during the prohibition era from 1920-1933. 'What objects like that tell us is that there wasn't a whole lot to do at the making of this movie,' he said. 'These guys had a lot of really good times before takes.' It wasn't until 2012 that the Dunes Center called upon archaeologists to dig up the site again to search for bigger structures. This time they were able to find the head of the sphinx that was 'about the size of a pool table.' The head is now on display at the Dunes Center but at the time they didn't have the resources to dig for the rest of the body. Now in 2014 Applied EarthWorks has become dedicated to uncovering the rest of the Sphinx before it disappears forever due to erosion. 'The site is basically being destroyed through erosion,' Hamilton said. 'It's become more critical to try to salvage some materials before they disappear.' Movie star: The sphinx in the film stand the test of time and  will be restored to look like it did in the film . The once hollow structure has been filed with sand and the material has become flimsier due to the moist air. Archaeologist Kholood Abdo Hintzman and his team at Applied EarthWorks carefully excavated the sphinx's body on October 6. To keep the plaster of Paris material from cracking, they soaked the structure in cheesecloth soaked with a preservation chemical. The team had to work against the weather and could only excavate for a couple hours a day due to the strong winds and the fog. Eight days later the body was fully excavated and they moved it to a remote location so they could dry it and shrink it to its original size. The Ten Commandments film was one of the first to employ special effects such as Technicolor and Jell-O to show the parting of the red seas. Huge at the time, the film had a $1 million budget. 'I think it's a great piece of Americana,' Jenzen said. 'But you have to hunker down to watch the whole thing, because it's more than three hours long and it's silent.' Those who wish to see the sphinx can do so in 2015.","The monumental plaster sphinx from the 1923 movie The Ten Commandments has been unearthed and will be on display next year .

"The Twelfth Doctor: Landing the role of Doctor Who is a dream come true for Peter Capaldi, who was obsessed with the programme as a youngster . Landing the role of Doctor Who is a dream come true for Peter Capaldi. But it’s more like a nightmare for some of the show’s old production staff. As a 14-year-old, her badgered them so persistently with fan mail they said they wished the Daleks ‘would exterminate him’. The Scot, now 55, regularly wrote to the Doctor Who production team asking for photos. But when Capaldi demanded to be made president of the Official Doctor Who Fan Club in 1972, it seems his enthusiasm started to grate on the show’s staff. The producer’s secretary, Sarah Newman, informed him the position had already been filled by a rival fan, Keith Miller, 13. Mr Miller later recalled: ‘He haunted my time running the fan club, as he was quite indignant he wasn’t considered for the post.’ Miss Newman later complained about Capaldi in a letter to the young Mr Miller. She said: ‘I think Capaldi’s the end and I wish the Daleks or someone would exterminate him.’ As a youth, the Scottish actor fired off regular missives to the Doctor Who production team asking for set photos. He also penned lengthy letters to the Radio Times and the Doctor Who International Fan Club magazine, praising his favourite episodes and marvelling at the special effects. In one letter written when he was 17, he even analysed the show’s opening credits, commending their ‘artistic integrity’. Mr Miller, Capaldi's arch-rival in the fan stakes, later recalled how Capaldi was annoyed he had lost out on the position and began pestering the BBC with constant messages. Writing in his book, The Official Doctor Who Fan Club Volume One, Mr Miller said: ‘He haunted my time running the fan club, as he was quite indignant he wasn’t considered for the post.’ He added in an interview with Starburst magazine: ‘I was given the fan club to take the strain of dealing with the advent of the super-fans like Peter Capaldi who wanted a running dialogue with the production team, away from Sarah.’ Lifelong fan: A 15-year-old Peter wrote to this letter to the Radio Times about Doctor Who. He also wrote a string of letters to the series' production staff, who soon grew tired of his constant badgering . In August 1972, Miss Newman complained about Capaldi in a letter to Mr Miller. She said: ‘You’re not by any means worse than Peter C... I think he’s the end and I wish the Daleks or someone would exterminate him or something to that effect.’ Mr Miller recalled the harassed BBC secretary even jokingly asked him to ‘sort him out’. He said: ‘During the next phone call to Sarah, I asked how things were going with Peter Capaldi. ""Oh god, I wish someone would sort him out."" Then she paused. ""Actually, he lives in Scotland too - could you pop over to Glasgow and sort him out for me?""' Capaldi, who is best known for playing foulmouthed spin doctor Malcolm Tucker in political satire The Thick of It, will join Doctor Who as the 12th incarnation of the Time Lord at the end of the Christmas Special. Odds-on favourite: Capaldi takes over from Matt Smith, right, who will play his last scenes as Doctor Who in this years Christmas Special, with the former Thick Of It star appearing in the Tardis for the first time next year . The actor, who has in the past admitted writing letters begging for production secrets, was the odds-on favourite to land the role in the weeks leading up to Sunday’s announcement. But he has faced criticism in the days since, with some viewers complaining that he is too old to play the Doctor. For the announcement, which was aired live on BBC1, Capaldi joined Zoe Ball to reveal himself to the audience and cameras. He described his relief at being able to relieve himself of the secret and told how he had loved Doctor Who since the age of nine. He said: ‘It’s so wonderful not to keep this secret any longer. For a while I couldn’t tell my daughter who kept on looking on the internet and kept seeing people saying so and so should be the Doctor and she got rather upset.’ He added: ‘[The audition] was quite hard because even though I’m a lifelong Doctor Who fan, I haven’t played Doctor Who since I was nine in the playground. I downloaded old scripts from the internet and read those.’",Doctor Who production staff even asked rival fan to 'sort him out'
"A Belgian artist is petitioning a court to rule whether the former king is her father. Delphine Boel, 46, claims that King Albert II had an affair with her mother Sybille de Selys Longchamps and she was the product of that regal encounter. Her lawyer Alain De Jonge said that his client is not motivated by money as she is a member of a major Belgian industrial family worth $1 billion. Lawyer Alain De Jonge with his client Delphine Boel who claims that former Belgian king Albert II is her father . Ms Boel claims that she is a result of an affair between her mother Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert . Former Belgian king Albert II, left, denies he is Delphine Boel's father although he is not expected in court . He told Belgian newspaper De Morgan: 'If the royal family got in a plane together and had an accident or, as in Nepal, were killed by a mad man, then she could be queen. But her ambitions do not stretch that far. It is more about the ending of a stigma. 'She is hoping no longer to be branded as the likely illegitimate daughter, but wishes to be recognised as a child. The court case is being conducted behind closed doors as is normal for Belgian family law. A lawyer for the former king said they were optimistic. If successful, Boel would be 15th in line for the Belgian throne. De Jonge has said that the court would initially examine whether her legal father, Jacques Boel, is a biological parent and that a recently conducted paternity test showed he was not. Media have reported that Boel has disinherited his daughter because of the shame the scandal had brought to his family. Under Belgian law a man cannot be forced to take a paternity test, but a judge could take his refusal to do so into account. Boel's case came to light in 1999 with the publication of a biography of Queen Paolo, Albert's Italian wife. It said Albert had formed an extra-marital relationship resulting in the birth of a daughter in the 1960s, when his brother Baudouin was king. He has never commented on the possible existence of such a daughter but did refer in his 1999 Christmas message to a crisis in his marriage 30 years earlier, the time of Boel's birth. If the court declares that King Albert is her father, Delphine Boel will be 14th in line to the Belgian throne . The court case in Brussels is being held behind closed doors as are all family law cases in Belgium . Albert II, 80, abdicated last year, citing health reasons, and was succeeded by his 54-year-old son Philippe. Boel's mother Sybille de Selys Longchamps, a baroness, has recounted in interviews her time with Albert and her decision to move to London after the end of their relationship. She and Boel divorced in 1978. She is likely to be a crucial witness in the case. Albert is not expected to appear in person. Albert's father King Leopold III abdicated, allowing his elder brother King Baudouin take over the throne. When Baudouin died without an heir, Albert assumed the throne until 2013 when he abdicated in favour of his eldest son, King Phillipe. Albert and his wife Queen Paola had three children although this case is seeking to identify Ms Boel as the king's fourth child - placing her 14th in line to the throne. The monarchy has been regarded as one of the few things uniting Belgium, a country beset by divisions between a richer Dutch-speaking north and French-speaking south viewed by separatist northerners as welfare-dependent. However, the royals have faced criticism, especially when it emerged that Queen Fabiola, the widow of Baudouin, had planned to pass on an estate in Spain using a trust to avoid paying tax. The reports caused the Belgian government to reform the system of allowances and taxation for members of the monarchy.","Delphine Boel, 46, claims her mother had an affair with Belgian's future king .

Arsenal fans will be hoping their new signing will soon be carrying something similar to this Gunners sports bag . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger may need to kit his new player out with the latest Gunners gear. If it's a new washbag Welbeck needs, Wenger just needs to long onto Arsenal's official website and fork out between £20 and £30 to ensure the striker doesn't go without this season. Welbeck bagged a brace on Monday night as Roy Hodgson's side won the opening game of their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. England captain  Wayne Rooney left the plane with Notts County chief executive Jim Rodwell, who made his FA international committee debut in Switzerland as part of the England party. Speaking England's win, Hodgson said: 'On Monday the players proved what I have been trying to say all along. 'They proved that - yes the World Cup didn't go our way, and we were very disappointed, but we have been building, we have been changing players, introducing new ones, so it wasn't a question of us suddenly hitting a brick wall (in Brazil). It wasn't a case of - all of a sudden this is all wrong, we have to do something different.

'It was a question of maintaining faith that we're on the right track, that we were getting the right players in the team. 'These young players will be good players without a shadow of a doubt so it was important to get off to a good start against the team in the group which people will be thinking are our biggest rivals.' Hodgson was also happy that his players maintained their desire to play for England despite the win-less campaign in Brazil. 'The one thing about these players, and I hope the public understand this, is that they all have a burning desire to play for England,' the 67-year-old added.

Tottenham looked to be in pole position to land Welbeck earlier on Monday, but the forward's preference was to join the Emirates Stadium club.

"America's top general has said he will only recommend military action against Islamic State militants in Syria directly if they become a threat to the U.S. homeland. General Martin Dempsey said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also said he believed key allies in the region, such as Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, will join the U.S. in its battle against the group. General Martin Dempsey said last night that he still believes the insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning any attacks against the U.S or Europe . While the Obama administration has so far restricted its military action against the militants to specific operations within Iraq, concerns have increased as Islamic State militants extended their reach, taking control of a swath of land stretching from Syria across the border and deep into western and northern Iraq. The group took over Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, in June, and has since declared an Islamic state, or caliphate, in territory under its control in Iraq and Syria. Speaking on a military plane en route to Afghanistan, Dempsey said: 'I think ISIS has been so brutal, and has wrapped itself in a radical religious legitimacy that clearly threatens everybody I just mentioned, that I think they will be willing partners,' said Dempsey, expressing optimism for the first time that the Arab nations would join in the conflict. He said while the Yemen-based al-Qaida, in the Arabian Peninsula, plotted and attempted attacks against the U.S., leading to counterterrorism strikes against the group, there had so far been no sign that the Islamic State militants were engaged in 'active plotting against the homeland,' the Associated Press has reported. He said: 'I can tell you with great clarity and certainty that if that threat existed inside of Syria that it would certainly be my strong recommendation that we would deal with it. I have every confidence that the president of the United States would deal with it.' Dempsey went on to say that the regional partners could come together and squeeze the group 'from multiple directions in order to initially disrupt and eventually defeat them. It has to happen with them, much less with us.' The Obama administration has so far restricted its military action against the militants to specific operations within Iraq. Pictured is an ISIS member in Raqqa, Syria . Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam, which Islamic militants had taken, but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops . Previously, when asked about airstrikes inside Syria, Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel have said all options remain on the table, although there has so far been no broader authorization for such operations. The Obama administration has authorized airstrikes within Iraq to protect U.S. personnel and facilities and to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces assist refugees driven from their homes by the Islamic State. Most of the recent strikes have been around the Mosul Dam, which Islamic militants had taken, but it is now back in the hands of the Iraqi and Kurdish troops. Senior U.S. leaders, from the White House to the Pentagon, have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis. As the Islamic State militants moved across Iraq, some Sunnis - including some members of the Iraqi security forces - either threw down their weapons or joined the group. Peshmerga fighters stand guard at Mosul Dam in northern Iraq last week . The U.S. has been encouraged as new Iraqi leaders, including Shiite prime minister-designate Haider al-Abadi, begin to take steps to form a new government and reach out to Sunnis. Officials have suggested that any additional military assistance from the U.S. to Iraq is contingent on those political and diplomatic steps by the government. One possibility, said Dempsey, would be to have U.S. forces provide more expanded advice and assistance to the Iraqi force. He said military assessment teams looked at about 50 Iraqi brigades and a number of the Kurdish units and have a good idea which ones have appropriate training and equipment and have not been infiltrated by militia. So far, Dempsey said the U.S. has not sought or received permission to put advisers into Iraqi brigades or headquarters units and accompany them into combat. Senior U.S. leaders, from the White House to the Pentagon, have said the key to success in Iraq is the formation of an inclusive government that will include disenfranchised Sunnis. Pictured are ISIS militants on the outskirts of Aleppo, Syria . To date, U.S. forces have conducted a total of 96 airstrikes across Iraq. Of those, 62 have been around the Mosul Dam. The strikes have helped to break the insurgents' momentum, said Dempsey, and strip away some of the mythology that the Islamic State is impregnable or overwhelming. Dempsey is on his way to Afghanistan to attend a change of command ceremony tomorrow. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford is stepping down as the top commander there; Army Gen. John Campbell will take over.","General Martin Dempsey said he still believes insurgent group is more of a regional threat and is not planning attacks against U.S. or Europe .

"Muhammad Ali is widely renowned as the best boxer to have ever lived - 'The Greatest' in fact - and he has inspired children around the world to take up the sport. Perhaps the most impressive professional boxer he inspired is former world champion Mike Tyson, who was feared around the world for his tenacity in the ring. Tyson, who was never far from controversy during his career, reveals the influence which Ali had on his life during the soon-to-be-released documentary film 'I Am Ali'. A film about Muhammad Ali's life, 'I Am Ali', is to be released on November 28 in the UK . Mike Tyson reveals that Ali inspired him to take up boxing when he met him in a youth detention centre . Tyson says that Ali was so inspirational that he would listen into his phonecalls just to hear his hero speak . Ali (right) eats some of his 57th brithday cake while standing next to Tyson in January 1999 . When spending time in a 'reformatory' - a youth detention centre - in the Bronx, New York, Tyson reveals that he was told he was in for a 'surprise'. After watching the film 'The Greatest', which stars Ali as a dramatised version of himself, Tyson and the other children were paid a surprise visit by the man himself. Describing the incident in the film, Tyson explains: 'It's a moment of my life where I just said: ""Wow that's awesome. How can I be like that?"" 'So I got involved with boxing and I met Cus D'Amato (a boxer and trainer) and Cus was very acquainted with Ali. He would talk to him on the phone and he'd call him up and talk to him. Ali looks on after knocking down Joe Frazier during one of third three famous match-ups . Tyson insists that he was immediately struck by Ali, a 'wow moment' in his life, and thought he was 'awesome' 'Sometimes I would pick up the phone and have a sneaky listen then put it down just so I could hear what they were talking about. 'It was different from my environment (in the Bronx). Everything was fighting, war and the concept of war - it was just the whole thing was different.' The film, which accesses Ali's personal audio journals and uses interviews from people close to the now 72-year-old to tell his life story, will be released in cinemas, on DVD and digital download in the UK on November 28.

"Vladimir Putin wants to see the independent state of Ukraine wiped off the map, the country’s interim prime minister claimed yesterday. As fresh clashes erupted in Odessa and across the east of the country, pro-Western Arseniy Yatsenyuk blamed Moscow’s secret services for dozens killed in a fire in the city on Friday. ‘What happened in Odessa was part of a plan by the Russian Federation to destroy Ukraine and its statehood,’ Mr Yatsenyuk alleged. ‘Russia sent people here to create chaos,’ he added. Scroll down for video . Blame: Ukraine's pro-Western interim prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk blamed Moscow¿s secret services for dozens killed in a fire in Odessa on Friday . He went on to beg Ukrainians to bury their differences ‘so as not to give the terrorists backed by Moscow the opportunity to divide our people’. Further violence engulfed the country over the weekend. In the eastern city of Mariupol, pro-Russian forces tricked soldiers into eating food laced with a sleeping potion before taking them hostage on Saturday. Some 2,000 pro-Moscow activists stormed the Odessa police HQ in the normally easygoing Black Sea resort, shouting ‘fascists, fascists’ and ‘Russia won’t abandon its own’ as they demanded the release of almost 130 ‘comrades’ arrested for bloody unrest in which 42 were killed. After forcing their way into the yard and smashing windows, the authorities caved in and released some 30 of the detainees. Engulfed by violence which is rapidly plunging Ukraine into full-scale civil war, the bespectacled Yatsenyuk begged his people to unite and to bury their differences ‘so as not to give the terrorists backed by Moscow the opportunity to divide our people’. Attack: Pro-western Yatsenyuk said Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to 'destroy Ukraine and its statehood' Russia had a very different take on it, with one senior figure demanding that Kiev’s leaders should be hauled before the International Criminal Court in The Hague over the Odessa ‘massacre’ in which pro-Russians were killed. Senior MP Mikhail Markelov warned ‘that Yugoslavia’s fate is in store for Ukraine’, referring to the years of ethnically-fuelled bloodshed that scarred the Balkans. Yatsenyuk countered by accusing Putin of a plan ‘to repeat in Odessa what is happening in the east of the country’. He spoke in Odessa, in Ukraine’s south, which was founded by Russian empress Catherine the Great, and is seen by some as a key target for Russia in seeking to grab territory stretching from pro-Moscow eastern areas to the Moldovan enclave of Transnistria which will this week make a new bid to be subsumed into the Kremlin empire. But he was also critical of his police, firing all commanders on Odessa for failing to protect people and failing to counter ‘terrorist forces’. ‘There were dozens of casualties resulting from a well prepared and organised action against people, against Ukraine and against Odessa,’ said Yatsenyuk, whose government is being closely aided by operatives from the CIA and FBI according to German sources. At the weekend, Putin’s entourage revealed he had received ‘thousands’ of calls for help from Ukrainians.

Two sides: The protesters can be seen surrounding a Ukrainian policeman outside the Odessa police department . Reunion: The crowd cheer as released detainees reunite with friend and family outside the police station in Odessa . Brotherhood: A protester gets a kiss from a supporter after being released by police . He has already secured permission from the Russian parliament to use military forces in Ukraine, and has as many as 65,000 in Russia and annexed Ukraine, where there was a show of aerial force - strategic bombers and fighter jets - at the weekend. In Mariupol, embarrassed troop commanders revealed that donations of food were spiked. ‘It turned out that the food contained a substance that induced sleep among the servicemen,’ the acting head of Mariupol criminal police department, Alexei Paniotov, said. ‘After about half an hour, about 20 unidentified people arrived in three cars and, taking advantage of their helpless state, took them prisoner along with four automatic rifles, a grenade launcher, a machine gun and ammunition.’ They were held overnight before being released yesterday. Ukraine faces acute tests in the next week as two regions - Donetsk and Lugansk - stage ‘illegal’ referendums which could see them splitting permanently from Ukraine. Western intelligence suspects that Russia is engaged in a plan to re-take vast swathes of Ukraine which in tsarist times were called ‘Novorossiya’, or New Russia, stretching from Kharkov in the north-east to Odessa in the south-west as well as Transitria in the west. Under such a scenario, Ukraine would have its east and south lopped off and become a rump state cut off entirely from the Black Sea, with all the industrial muscle and port cities falling to the Kremlin. In February, before Crimea was annexed, a mysterious internet petition in Russia called on Putin to invade ‘Novorossiya’ - and met with overwhelming approval. After 100,000 signed, it was dramatically withdrawn with no traces left on the web but now there is suspicion that it revealed a Kremlin plan. In his TV question and answer session three weeks ago, Putin dropped another hint. ‘Novorossiya - Kharkov, Lugansk, Donetsk, and Odessa were not part of Ukraine in Tsarist times,’ he said. ‘They were transferred in 1920 [after the Bolshevik Revolution]. Why? God knows.’ Ukrainian forces were last night said to be surrounding Sloviansk amid expectations its troops were planning to storm the city to free it from control by pro-Russian militants.","Arseniy Yatsenyuk blamed Moscow’s secret services for the fire in Odessa .

"Andy Lee went through eight-and-a-half long years of a pro career before finally getting his hands on the middleweight championship of the world. He is now adamant he won’t let go of his WBO title without a hell of a fight, no matter who the challenger — and he is determined to make sure the defence takes place on home soil. Early signs point to former British Olympian Billy Joe Saunders to be the challenger, the undefeated European champion and mandatory challenger for the belt, but while the opponent may seem certain, the venue, at present time, most certainly is not. Andy Lee celebrates his win over Matt Korobov after their fight for the vacant WBO middleweight title . Billy Joe Saunders may be the challenger - but he'll have to travel to Ireland to do so . ‘It’s got to be in Ireland. It’s the biggest place, the biggest sell — the biggest possible arena for it,’ said Lee following his sixth-round stoppage win over the previously undefeated Matt Korobov, a fellow southpaw, in Las Vegas on Saturday night. ‘I’m the champ, I’m not going outside of Ireland, he can come to me if he wants to fight me, that’s it,’ added Ireland’s latest world champion, our 21st to hold a legitimate title, before the gentleman of Irish boxing added with a laugh: ‘Come try and take this belt away!’ The Limerick native (now 34-2 as a pro) was in celebratory mood from the moment referee Kenny Bayless had called a halt, at one minute and 10 seconds of round six in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas arena, after Korobov (now 24-1) had been overwhelmed by a fighter who would not be denied. The Russian, a two-time world amateur champion, had left himself open for a vicious right hook, which has now become a trademark for Castleconnell man Lee. Arguably more impressive, however, was the flurry of punches delivered by the determined 30-year-old, throwing around 18 unanswered blows to force Bayless to step in, with his 31-year-old opponent in no state to defend himself. ‘We were trading and a lot of the times he was having the better of it but my right hook is a killer punch. I thought he wasn’t going down but I wasn’t taking any chances,’ said Lee following the win, immediately giving thanks to friends, family and supporters, but reserving special praise for two men in particular. Until Lee stopped the unbeaten man, the fight had been tentative with neither fighter able to make his mark . Referee Kenny Bayless steps in to end the fight as Korobov looks stunned while Lee races to celebrate . One was trainer Adam Booth - a calm presence in Lee’s corner, betraying the mood of the fight up until that point, as his man, frankly, looked to be on his way to a lopsided points loss. Lee had connected with just 23 per cent of his punches (to Korobov’s 35 per cent), although he had landed 55 shots to the Russian’s 48. Korobov had just about edged five close rounds, with Lee possibly in with a shout for one or two, but Booth obviously knew something we had not. Lee’s other inspirational figure was obviously looking down on him, and will cash in a lucrative docket if St Peter keeps a book open for boxing’s dear departed. The late Emanuel ‘Manny’ Steward had touted Lee as a world champion from the day the young Limerick man turned pro under him in 2006. ‘I would like to say thank you to my manager (Booth), who has done so much for me over the last couple of years, but it’s also for the man who made me, Emanuel Steward,’ said Lee, speaking to HBO TV in the ring after the victory. ‘We spent seven, eight years together and he said I would win a world title. His wife, Marie, came here today, flew all the way from Detroit, so from everybody from Detroit and Kronk [Gym], thank you very much.’ The fight heats up in the middle of the ring and Lee was soon to finish it altogether with his stoppage . Thanks were also given to his wife, Maud, and a small but vocal Irish singing section. His patriotism was a notable theme of his immediate post-fight interview with HBO TV, climaxing with a roar of ‘Up the Irish — Get in!’ Later, speaking to iFilm London, Lee was keen to emphasise that he had won the title as an Irishman first and foremost when addressing unconfirmed reports that he is the first fighter from the Travelling community to win a world title. ‘Yeah, I don’t know if that’s true — maybe the Hiltons of Canada, it could be one of them,’ said Lee, a settled Traveller. ‘It [the title] is for me, for my family, for Adam, for his family. It’s a good achievement, I don’t know how long it’s been since Ireland has had a middleweight champion and I’m very proud to be a champion from Ireland.’ Lee lands a left hand on Korobov as he came into his own as the fight approached the halfway mark . No bonus points for that answer — Steve Collins claimed his first world title at 160lb after a fifth-round stoppage win over Chris Pyatt in 1995. It took the Dubliner seven-and-a-half years and two failed title challenges before reaching the Holy Grail. Lee was forced to wait a year longer, having been voted as champion elect by everyone from Steward to the vast majority of Irish boxing aficionados after becoming an Olympian in 2004 at the Athens Games. ‘There’s times when you don’t [think it will happen],’ said Lee, ‘but you have to persevere… If you keep working hard every day and remain focused on what you want to achieve, you’ll get it eventually.’ He got it, alright — in style.","Andy Lee won the vacant WBO middleweight belt in Las Vegas on Saturday .

"Jose Mourinho craved a striker and, without a doubt, the Chelsea manager got one when he pulled £32million out and got Diego Costa in return. The 25-year-old, swapping reigning La Liga champions Atletico Madrid for Chelsea, already looks the answer to the prayers that so often emerged from Stamford Bridge some 12 months ago. And there has been no adjustment period needed for Costa whose explosive start already trumps some of the Premier League's finest imports, including Sergio Aguero, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Didier Drogba, Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres. What other imports will the Premier League get? Follow transfer deadline day LIVE here! Best start: Diego Costa scored four goals in three games for Chelsea in his impressive Premier League start . Thanks: Costa seems to have brought an end to the Chelsea curse but his Premier League career is young . Brace: Costa managed to score twice against Everton in the 6-3 win to bring his Premier League tally to four . With four goals in three games, Diego Costa has made a better Premier League start than some of the most successful recent imports. Goals after three Premier League games: . 4 - Diego Costa (Chelsea) 3 - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) 2 - Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United) 1 - Didier Drogba (Chelsea) 1 - Luis Suarez (Liverpool) 1 - Fernando Torres (Liverpool) PS - Robin van Persie did score four in his first three games for Manchester United, but he had already been in the Premier League for eight years. With four goals in three games, Costa looks a fine acquisition. The Spain (and former Brazil) international took just 17 minutes to get going with his debut Premier League goal against Burnley on the opening day of the season. Was it a fluke? No. Costa netted again at Stamford Bridge against Leicester City five days later. What followed were reports emerging about the striker's fitness, suggesting he was out for six weeks after pulling up in training, but these proved to be hogwash. Costa looked fit enough when scoring twice against Everton - in the first and 90th minute -  as Chelsea made it three victories in as many games. The curse of the Chelsea striker is something owner Roman Abramovich know all too well. Over the years, nearly £200m has been thrown at the problem. Adrian Mutu, Hernan Crespo, Mateja Kezman, Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Shevchenko, Claudio Pizarro, Nicolas Anelka, Franco Di Santo, Daniel Sturridge, Torres, Romelu Lukaku, Patrick Bamford, Lucas Piazon, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto’o are among the imports. But now, with the returning Drogba as back-up, the £32m Costa appears the best fit. Return: Didier Drogba's Premier League start with Chelsea saw him net just once in the first three matches . Gone: Luis Suarez nabbed just the one goal in his opening three Premier League starts with Liverpool . Proven: Sergio Aguero won Manchester City the title and scored three in three when he came to England .

"Ahmad Abousamra, 32, is a Syrian-American who is the son of prominent Boston doctor . A college educated American citizen with a knack for computers is believed to be one of the men running the brutally effective ISIS social media operation, which is helping to attract hundreds of fighters from across the world - including the U.S., Britain and Canada. Ahmad Abousamra, 32, was born in France and raised in the upscale Boston suburb of Stoughton. His father is a prominent endocrinologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. He attended the exclusive Xaverian Brothers Catholic high school and made the Dean's List at Northeastern University. He graduated with a degree in a technology field then took a job at a telecommunications company. U.S. officials tell ABC News that he is now putting his skills to work for ISIS, the brutal terrorist organization that has been effectively using 21st century methods like Twitter memes, Facebook posts, selfies and YouTube videos to promote its radical 6th century Islamic ideals. In 2004, federal authorities say, Abousamra left his American life behind and traveled to Iraq in the hopes of fighting U.S. soldiers as part of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Instead, he was recruited to the groups 'media wing.' 'If you do have a European language ability, if you have computer skills, if you are quite clever and you come join ISIS, you are likely to be used for social media output,' Peter Neumann, the director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, told ABC. When he returned to the U.S. in 2006, he was questioned by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. He was released without charge and slipped out of the country and back to Syria. In 2009, he was charged with federal terrorism offenses. He is currently on the FBI's Most Wanted list and the government has offered a $50,000 reward for his capture. Most Wanted: The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for the capture of Abousamra, who is wanted on federal terrorism charges . Brutally effective: ISIS has managed to use 21th century tactics to promote its brutal 6th century worldview . Authorities now believe Abousamra is in charge of running social media for ISIS, according to ABC . ISIS has shown remarkable sophistication with its online presence. When the group released its video showing the execution of journalist James Foley, it was simultaneously posted on dozens of online forums, Twitter accounts of other social media sites. A slew of Twitter and Facebook accounts spread the group's message by posting pictures of the brutal executions and torture that ISIS terrorist bestow on their enemies - all while staying a step ahead of Silicon Valley's attempts to shut them down. Jihadist fighters who join ISIS, meanwhile, project an image of a certain kind of twisted glamour, showing off their new life and posing with weapons and on military vehicles. 'ISIS understands very well that in order for an act of terrorism to be effective, it needs to actually terrorize people,'Mr Neumann told ABC. 'The act of communication that follows the act of violence is almost as important as the act of violence itself.'","Ahmad Abousamra, 32, was raised in an upscale Boston suburb and attended private school .

"A 40-year-old man who was convicted aged 15 of raping and strangling to death a high school ­classmate has been paroled. Conrad Engweiler is set to be released next month, following the decision by the Oregon parole board on Tuesday. Engweiler has served more than 24 years for the aggravated murder, rape and sodomy of 16-year-old Erin Tonna Reynolds in the Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1990. Conrad Engweiler (pictured in May this year) has served more than 24 years for the aggravated murder, rape and sodomy of 16-year-old Erin Tonna Reynolds in the Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1990. He is due to be released next month . A judge sentenced him in 1991 to life in prison with the chance of parole after 40 years. He was exempt from death penalty under Oregon state law due to being a minor. Engweiler, who has been an inmate at the Oregon State Correctional Institution in Salem, will be out in just a few weeks. His case has been before the courts repeatedly over the years because he was sentenced under unclear guidelines initially. Erin Tonna Reynolds, 16, was raped and murdered by her classmate in 1990 . His lawyer has argued that with good behavior time considered, he's overdue for release. The state Supreme Court earlier told the board to start the pre-release process 'with appropriate dispatch'. At a hearing in May, Engweiler told the parole hearing that his prison time has taught him remorse, empathy and compassion. His release has been deferred until October 16. Engweiler will spend his life on parole and be supervised closely for at least three years. He will also be required to register as a sex offender. Before approving his release, the parole board had ordered three separate psychological evaluations. The court's decision goes against the pleas of Miss Reynold's family who have begged that Engweiler spend the rest of his life behind bars, according to Oregonlive.com. Miss Reynolds, who had survived cancer, was found murdered outside Engweiler's father's home, buried in a pile of rubbish on February 22, 1990. Engweiler, pictured in court in court at the age of 15, said that he had been high on drugs when he raped, sodomized and strangled classmate Erin Tonna Reynolds. He is due to be released after 24 years in jail . She had been reported as a missing person by her parents' the evening before when she missed her curfew. The following morning, police were called by Engweiler's father after he reported his son missing and said that strange car was parked outside his home. The car was identified as Miss Reynolds' vehicle and while officers inspected the home, dogs began barking in the back yard. Drag marks to a ravine led to the 16-year-old's body under debris. The student was killed a few days after she had been told by doctors that she was cancer-free. Earl Reynolds comforts his daughter, Beth Greear, at a parole hearing for Conrad Engweiler in 2012. The family have pleaded that Erin Reynolds' killer be kept behind bars . Engweiler was later found hiding out at the home of his mother's attorney and was taken into custody. The teenagers, both students at Sunset High School, had been on a few dates but Miss Reynolds had ended the relationship. At the time of his conviction, Engweiler told the court that he had was under the influence of LSD and marijuana when he killed the girl. Miss Reynolds' sister Beth Greear told KGW that she believed Engweiler posed 'absolutely a risk to society'. Engweiler, pictured during his parole hearing in May, killed his high school classmate outside his father's home in February 1990.

"Wilfried Zaha's Manchester United career took another turn for the worse on Tuesday night as the £15million forward was an unused substitute as Louis van Gaal's side crashed out of the Capital One Cup with a humiliating 4-0 defeat against MK Dons. The 21-year-old, who is still yet to start a Premier League for United since arriving from Crystal Palace in January 2013, was a noticeable inclusion on the bench at stadium:mk but failed to get any minutes on the pitch as Van Gaal opted for other alternatives.

"The Shooter, unmasked: The Navy SEAL who shot dead Osama Bin Laden will sit down for his first television interview next month, but may face criminal action for doing so. Above, the shirt the shooter war during Operation Neptune's Spear on display at the National September 11th Museum . The Pentagon has warned the Navy SEAL that shot and killed Osama Bin Laden who is set to reveal his identity in a documentary is still bound by a 'non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information' - and could face criminal proceedings for doing so. On Wednesday it was revealed one of the greatest mysteries in American military history will be solved next month when Fox News airs a documentary about the SEAL Team 6 member known as 'The Shooter'. The soldier's identity has been intensely guarded since the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan - fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Quada - but he has since retired and is reportedly ready to be unmasked. However the Pentagon has now urged 'The Shooter' to 'abide by the SEAL Ethos, particularly the core tenant, ''I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions''' and that protecting such secrets is a 'liefelong obligation'. 'As a private citizen, former or retired service members are free to speak with the media and exercise their First Amendment rights,' Navy Commander Amy Derrick-Frost, a Defense Department spokeswoman, told Business Insider. 'However, it is important for all former service members to adhere to their signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) when they seek to openly discuss classified or sensitive information, or make claims about their active duty operations or accomplishments. 'NDAs are voluntarily executed by service members. 'After a thorough briefing on the NDA and what each paragraph contains, the service member is aware that his/her signature signifies their understanding and intent to comply with the lifelong obligation for protecting National Defense Information.' Crucially, Derrick-Frost told Business Insider that the military had confirmed the soldier interviewed by Fox News for the two-part broadcast The Man Who Killed Usama bin Laden' was indeed the man who killed the terrorist leader. Killed: 9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was shot dead at his Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound in May 2011. The identity of the SEAL that shot him has been a fiercely guarded since . The attack: This is the plan for the Seal Team 6 'Kill Operation' that finally netted Bin Laden . Above, the Abbottabad compound where Bin Laden lived before his death. In the three years since the raid, the Shooter's identity has been kept a secret for fear he could be targeted by al-Qaeda or other terrorist networks once loyal to Bin Laden . 'If in fact this individual was associated with the military unit that carried out the UBL raid, which is yet to be determined, he is still bound by his non-disclosure agreement to not discuss classified information, especially in a nationally televised interview,' Derrick-Frost said. The documentary is set to air November 11. Fox said this week the SEAL 'w share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden'. 'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives' Fox said in a press release. It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.' It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected, or whether he will be named and appear on camera. Fox says he will also share what it was like to confront Bin Laden and what happened when the terrorist took his final breath. Also included in the special will be footage of the ceremony in which the Shooter donated the shirt he wore during the raid to the National September 11 Memorial Museum earlier this year. While the shooter's identity has remained a secret in the three years since Bin Laden's assassination, a few details have emerged about his life from an interview he gave to Esquire magazine last year. Now retired, it was revealed the special-forces solider has suffered a breakdown in his marriage and is so concerned about being identified that he refused to meet families of 9/11 victims to preserve his anonymity, said the New York Post. Hearts in mouth: President Obama, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, watched the raid unfold in front of their eyes back in Washington D.C. In an interview with Esquire magazine in February 2013, the shooter described in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history. In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.' Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head. He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see. He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both. 'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up]. 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath. 'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**. 'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.' The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden. He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'. Earlier this week, the former Navy SEAL who wrote an inside account about the mission that killed Osama bin Laden is facing a criminal investigation for revealing classified information, reports claim. Matthew Bissonnette controversially released No Easy Day in 2012 without approval from the Department of Defense, selling thousands of copies worldwide before it was even published. Now, as he prepares to publish a sequel, his lawyer has revealed a vast proportion of the profits could be soaked up by extensive fines leveled by the Pentagon.","The man who shot the 9/11 mastermind will give his first televised interview next month on Fox News .

"Disgraced congressman resigned his New York seat in 2011 after accidentally tweeting a photo of his groin . New account created using the handle @anthonyweiner instead of the doomed @repweiner that led to his demise . Weiner considering whether to run for NYC mayor later this year . Anthony Weiner, the disgraced Democrat, whose lewd Twitter photos of his bulging crotch led to him resign from Congress in 2011, is back tweeting. Rather than some humble words or even something more profound, Weiner's first tweet was simply a link. Those brave enough to click through were treated to his 64-point plan to restore the middle class in New York City. Hello World: A 'fresh' start for Anthony Weiner on his new Twitter page. Cancel account? You don't have to look very far to find the old 'Weiner' tweets that brought about his demise . Many view the plan as a campaign manifesto should he decide to run for mayor. However, despite the former congressman wanting a 'fresh start' and launching a new account today with the handle @anthonyweiner, it is clear that Mr Weiner still does not know exactly how to use Twitter to his benefit. His old scandalous Twitter account @repweiner still exists complete with post-bulge, pre-resignation messages. By creating this new account he loses his 68,000 followers. That photo: The not-so-private crotch shot pic that led to Anthony Weiner having to resign . Weiner was a leading candidate to run the nation's largest city, until he derailed his political career with messages to women on Twitter and Facebook. Weiner resigned from Congress in May 2011 amid a sexting scandal that involved him publicly tweeting lewd pictures of his crotch. Pictures that were intended for a woman he was flirting with online instead went to tens of thousands of followers. After a series of vehement denials, the married lawmaker finally admitted that he had exchanged racy online messages with several women and was forced to resign from Congress. The seven-term Democrat initially claimed both his Twitter and Facebook accounts had been hacked but later admitted he had indeed sexted six women. Porn actress Ginger Lee, Las Vegas blackjack dealer Lisa Weiss and Megan Broussard, a 26-year-old single mother from Texas, were among the women who claimed they had his photos. He had been married to his wife, Huma Abedin for less than a year when the photos were discovered. Since then, he's kept a remarkably low . profile, staying out of the limelight and according to interviews that . he's given, working on his marriage and looking after his young boy. Troubled times: Mr Weiner resigned from his congressional seat in June of 2011 . A return to Twitter could be seen as a signal that he is ready to be back in the public eye. It is not the first time Weiner has been said to be plotting a return to public life. He recently told the New York Times Magazine that he's considering a race for mayor this year. 'I don’t have this burning, overriding desire to go out and run for office,' Weiner told The Times. 'It’s not the single animating force in my life as it was for quite some time. But I do recognize, to some degree, it’s now or maybe never for me, in terms of running for something.' If he does decide to run, he will face an uphill battle to overtake City Council Speaker Christine Quinn in the crowded Democratic primary for New York City Mayor. Standing by him: Weiner's wife Huma Abedin was pregnant when his sexting scandal emerged. He has spent almost two years hiding from the press and keeping a very low profile . Last week, Weiner reactivated anthonyweiner.com, his official website which had remained silent since his resignation. The former congressman had largely stayed off Twitter and his @repweiner account for about 18 months, except to share a video of people in the Rockaways section of Queens who lost their homes in Hurricane Sandy. Today, he simply tweeted his new Twitter handle to redirect followers. Weiner had more than 5,000 followers on Monday evening.","Disgraced congressman resigned his New York seat in 2011 after accidentally tweeting a photo of his groin .

Shamil Tarpischev, of the Russian Tennis Federation, made the remarks during an appearance on a local TV talk show this month alongside former Olympic singles champion Elena Dementieva. When Dementieva was asked what it was like playing against the Williams sisters, Tarpischev cut in and called them the 'Williams brothers', before adding: 'It's scary when you really look at them.'

He was also ordered to pay a $25,000 fine. Speaking in Singapore today, ahead of her WTA Finals defense, Williams said: 'I think the WTA did a great job of taking (the) initiative and taking immediate action to his comments. 'I thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time. I thought they were in a way bullying.

Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, 27, has also spoken out against her compatriot's comments. 'I think they were very disrespectful and uncalled for and I'm glad that many people have stood up, including the WTA,' said Miss Sharapova, who is also in Singapore for the BNP Paribas WTA Finals. 'It was very inappropriate, especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in sport, but being part of the Olympic committee.'

"This was brutal, the most emphatic example yet of the massive gulf between these sides in one-day cricket that leaves England searching desperately for answers if they are not to crash to yet another World Cup humiliation. It was always probable India, the world champions, would provide much stiffer opposition over 50-overs than the rabble who crashed to three heavy Test defeats. But no-one expected it to be as embarrassing for the hosts as this. India, and their passionate supporters, have come alive in coloured clothing, emphasising their modern priorities, while England have looked like an out-dated throwback of a one-day side lacking confidence and imagination. VIDEO Cook's selection doubts . Easy does it: Shikhar Dhawan hugs Virat Kohli after smashing the winnings runs . Celebration: Ajinkya Rahane after reaching his century in double quick time . I can't look: Alastair Cook pulls his cap over his eyes after another woeful ODI display by England . VIDEO Captain Cook belives England can turn ODI fortunes around . A crushing nine-wicket defeat, sealed with an incredible 117 balls to spare, gives India their first win in a bilateral one-day series on these shores for 24 years and hands Alastair Cook his fifth successive one-day series defeat. These three successive humbling losses are close to as bad as it can get in one-day cricket. Only when England sent their Twenty20 team to contest a 50-over series in the Caribbean earlier this year under Stuart Broad have they been successful in the longer limited-overs game, providing considerable food for thought. What a long time ago now that Test vindication must seem for Cook, who almost cruelly finds himself back under the microscope as captain so soon after rising to the greatest challenge of his career to turn the Test tables on India. And how long ago last year’s Champions Trophy now seems when England threw away their chance against these same opponents on this same Edgbaston ground to win their first global trophy in the longer form of the one-day game. It is easy to forget now that England’s methods lifted them to the top of the world one-day rankings just two years ago under Cook and took them to within 20 runs with 16 balls left and six wickets in hand of that Champions Trophy win. Yet that is a world away now, with the start of the long run of one-day cricket that is supposed to give England a much better chance of winning their first World Cup turning into a nightmare and leading to much soul-searching. ‘It was tough to take,’ admitted Cook after a game that was done and dusted by 4.30pm. ‘It’s a really tough place to be but we’ve got to stay true to our beliefs as a team and as players. When you start losing people chip away at you and you start doubting yourself. It’s a true test of character for the whole team now.’ India certainly played a different one-day game on Tuesday, a tigerish performance in the field and a lack of dynamism from England leaving them woefully short of par when they were bowled out in the last over for just 206. Only Moeen Ali, given his first chance in this series, provided any hope for England with a positive display of one-day hitting that has to be a template for his colleagues. It is a question of mind-set and tactics as much as personnel. Castled: Alex Hales looks back after being bowled by a beauty from Bhuvneshwar Kumar . Mob rule: The India players congratulate Kumar after his dismissal of Hales . The long walk: Cook trudges back to the pavilion after being caught trying to cut . Trying something different: Eoin Morgan attempts a reverse sweep during a stilted innings . England are criticised for playing ‘old-fashioned’ one-day cricket but there is nothing new or innovative, really, in using your feet to spinners and hitting over the top, as Moeen did productively in reaching 67 off 50 balls. It was England’s age-old problem in forcing the pace against spin that proved their undoing in the last two games but here they had just as many problems against what can only just be described as ‘pace’ bowling. Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were hardly express but had the pace and nous to reduce England to 23 for three, a position from which there was no way back despite the efforts of Moeen and, to a lesser extent, Joe Root. England’s score never looked enough but it was shown to be hopelessly inadequate by India’s reply as they cruised home with almost half their innings in hand for the loss of only Ajinkya Rahane, who made his first one-day century. Sweeping statement: Moeen Ali gets one away to the boundary in his 67 from just 50 balls . Nearly a goner: Steven Finn (centre) narrowly avoids being run out . Over and out: Harry Gurney is bowled by Mohammed Shami to wrap up the England innings . It was ridiculously easy for India, with only the paucity of England’s total stopping Shikhar Dhawn reaching his hundred, too. As it was he smashed a six off Harry Gurney to finish things off and leave himself three short of his landmark. As for England, surely they must reconsider their approach to one-day cricket? ‘We don’t need to change our approach we just need to get better,’ added Cook, who insisted he wanted to remain as one-day captain. ‘I’ve captained for three-and-a-half years with the goal of trying to win the World Cup in Australia. I know that sounds far-fetched but there’s a lot of good players in our changing room and if we improve we’ve got a chance. We have to believe that.’ It is fast becoming, with just a dead rubber at Headingley on Friday to come in this series, an even bigger challenge for Cook than turning round Test cricket. Feeling down: Steven Finn on the floor as India pile on the runs . The joy of six: Indian fans celebrate a maximum by Rahane (left) in the easy win . Hitting out: Shikhar Dhawan pulls the ball to the boundary in his innings of 97 not out . None came, but many more boundaries did. Both India openers reached their 50s with sixes, Rahane first - sweeping Moeen - and then Dhawan hoisting Anderson high over long on. They were still greedy for more, Rahane racing to a 96-ball hundred containing nine fours and four sixes and Dhawan finally putting England out of their misery with his fourth six to finish the rout. With every blow, the cheers and jeers in the crowd rose another notch. As in Nottingham, though, it was with bat rather than ball that England had once again put themselves in an impossible position.","India win series 3-0 after cruising to victory with 19.3 overs to spare .

"I suffered a number of concussions in my playing career and in those days it was very much the done thing to just shake it off and carry on playing. I lose count of the amount of times that happened. On some occasions it was actually seen as a bit of a joke, something to laugh about, when a team-mate or opponent was clearly knocked senseless and not in control of their faculties. But I’m pleased to say that culture is changing. As we learn more about the long-term repercussions of head injuries, it’s important that sports adapt accordingly and introduce measures which keep players safe, from grassroot level up to the professional game. No laughing matter: Head injuries used to be considered funny, but we're gradually changing that . Moving forward: Moody has agreed to donate his brain to medial science after death to speed up research . There is still a great deal to learn — and I for one have agreed to donate my brain to medical science after I die in an effort to help with that — but the key thing for me is that players, coaches, referees and parents are all educated about the symptoms and risks associated with concussion. I was delighted to join the Mail on Sunday’s concussion campaign when I was first approached more than a year ago and I’m proud to have played a part in helping to get people talking about what is a difficult but important topic. Putting your head where it hurts: Rugby is a great sport but safety has to come first . There’s more to be done, but it feels as if rugby is leading the way. It’s a brilliant sport and one that I want to see more and more children playing. But in order to do that we have to be able to look parents in the eye and say that their children will receive the best possible care if they do suffer a head knock.","In the past people used to laugh when players got knocked senseless and carried on .

"Expensive taste: Son of Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, wearing a shirt emblazoned with his father's face, has reportedly spent $70million of his country's money . He lives a typical Malibu playboy lifestyle - residing in a sprawling beach mansion, has dated rapper Eve and even splashed out $3million on Michael Jackson memorabilia. But now Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue is set to lose it all after it was revealed that the son of Equatorial Guinea's president is being hunted by the U.S. government for looting more than $70million from his own country. Mangue, 39, used his position as a government minister to siphon millions of dollars for personal use, according to two civil forfeiture complaints filed in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. As part of an international collaboration to retrieve his fortune, the U.S. government is now trying to recover the $70million. U.S. authorities believe the son of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema amassed more than . $100million in various schemes while he served as the country's . forestry minister. Among them were demanding companies pay a 'tax' for doing business in Equatorial Guinea as well as providing Mangue with . gifts and free services, according to court documents filed in the U.S. In what appeared to be a concerted action, France last month seized 11 luxury sports cars belonging to him and a Spanish investigative judge has been asked to seize properties in Madrid and Las Palmas in the Canary Islands owned by the president, his sons and ministers. Equatorial Guinea is a country of around . 680,000 people which has become a major oil, gas and timber producer, . resulting in billions of dollars in revenue. Despite this fact, the majority of the population live on a dollar a day. And despite already having a government . salary of $6,800 a month, Mangue is accused of tapping into the nation's . wealth and indulging his lavish tastes. Mangue, who is American-educated, spent $30million on a Malibu . mansion, $38.5million on a Gulfstream jet and $3.2million on . Michael Jackson memorabilia that included a crystal-covered glove from . the Bad tour and a basketball signed by the singer and Michael Jordan. Wacko for Jacko: Mangue is wanted by the U.S. Government for spending his country's resources on Michael Jackson's crystal-covered glove and a basketball signed by the singer .

Worlds apart: The majority of citizens of Equatorial Guinea live on a dollar a day (left) while government minister Mangue spent millions of his nation's wealth in Malibu . Among the other items purchased by Mangue, according to federal officials, was a 2011 Ferrari . valued at more than $530,000. 'We are sending the message loud and . clear: The United States will not be a hiding place for the ill-gotten . riches of the world's corrupt leaders' Assistant Attorney General . Lanny Breuer . He also stored 24 luxury cars worth . nearly $10million at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles and . shipped them to France, which has reportedly since seized 11 of them. Last year it was reported that Mangue was dating the rapper and actress Eve, spending close . to $700,000 to rent Microsoft billionaire Paul Allen's 303-foot yacht . Tatoosh to impress her, according to the New York Post. A friend of Eve told the New York . tabloid that he had been chasing her for a long time and that she . finally gave in to his invitation. Meet and greet: The Obamas meet president of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo and his wife Costancia . All about Eve: The playboy is said to have rented a super-yacht from Microsoft billionaire to impress the rapper and actress . The Grammy award winner was reportedly named in the ongoing investigation into Mangue and  foreign corruption. Eve used her Twitter account to deny the allegations and urged her fans not to believe everything they read. Authorities are seeking to . recover $70million in stolen funds from Mangue for 'the benefit of the . people of the country from which it was taken'. Assistant Attorney General . Lanny Breuer said: 'We are sending the message loud and . clear: The United States will not be a hiding place for the ill-gotten . riches of the world's corrupt leaders.' An email message left for Purificacion Angue Ondo, Equatorial Guinea's ambassador to the U.S., was not immediately returned. Mangue would give various stories to banks that questioned his large sums of cash, authorities said. When Nguema opened an account at a California bank in 2007, he claimed that he acquired money from a family inheritance along with trading expensive, custom-made cars. His father, who has led Equatorial Guinea since 1979, has been . accused by Amnesty International of torturing and unjustly imprisoning . political opponents. Bad investment: Mangue (left) spent millions on Michael Jackson memorabilia including the famous crystal-covered glove . Lavish luxuries: He is said to have spent $38.5million on a Gulfstream jet (file picture) The U.S. Senate Permanent . Subcommittee on Investigations issued reports in 2004 and last year . regarding possible corruption by Equatorial Guinea government officials. The 2010 report found that powerful . foreign officials and their families used attorneys, real estate agents . and lobbyists to circumvent anti-corruption laws. In the two civil forfeiture complaints, it is stated that Mangue's assets can be . forfeited because he engaged in misappropriation and theft of public . funds for his benefit. Poverty: Malabo neighbourhood in Equatorial Guinea stands in contrast to President Mbasogo's riches . Equatorial Guinea was a relatively ignored place until American energy company Exxon Mobil discovered oil and gas there in 1994. U.S. companies continue to dominate the industry there but face growing competition. Most oil from the country, which produces billions of dollars in annual revenue, is exported to America. Despite its newfound wealth, life for the vast majority of the country's 680,000 people remains a struggle. The majority live below the poverty line with tens of thousands having no access to electricity or clean water. It was listed by U.S. think tank Freedom House as among one of the world's worst regimes along with North Korea, Burma and Somalia. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo seized power in 1979 from his uncle, who said he was a sorcerer and collected human skulls. The President has created a one-party state in a country with Africa's most notorious prison, Black Beach, which is known for its torture.","Son of Equatorial Guinea's president splashed out $38.5m on private jet .

"Eve Branson, the 90-year-old mother of billionaire Sir Richard, has denied being saved from an inferno on her son's private Caribbean island by film star Kate Winslet. In August 2011 it was widely reported that Titanic star Kate had rescued Eve as she tottered down stairs at Necker Island, picking her up in her arms and carrying her to safety, after a lightning storm caused a huge blaze. But, in an interview with The Observer Magazine today Eve dismisses the heroic act, saying that Kate only carried her down four steps and ‘that was it.’ Scroll down for video . Rescue: Kate Winslet wraps her arm around Sir Richard Branson's mother Eve, after the fire from his blazing home on Necker Island in the Caribbean . 'She did not save me!' Eve Branson, right with her billionaire son Sir Richard in 1996, claims that, contrary to wide belief, she was not saved by Kate Winslet when Richard's Necker Island was on fire in 2011 . Alight: Sir Richard Branson's luxury home on Necker Island in the Caribbean, which was been damaged by a middle-of-the-night fire on Monday August 22, 2011 . She said it was actually her grandsons that saved her. ‘It was the hurricane of hurricanes and we were on fire and we would have all been burnt alive if it wasn't for my grandsons,’ she said. ‘It was four or five in the morning and they went around getting everyone out of bed. ‘I remember saying, “I'd better put my mac on,” because I wanted to cover up and Jack [Eve’s grandson] saying “No, not right now.” ‘I'd just about got outside and the rain was pouring down and I didn't have my contact lenses in, but I was making my way out and Kate and her two children were behind me. ‘She just sort of picked me up and took me down four steps and that was it.’ She . said she was ‘a bit slow’ for Kate, who gave birth to her third child .

Paradise: Necker island in the Caribbean, owned by Sir Richard Branson, costs £1,000 per person per night . Sir Richard Branson, who is worth nearly £4bn, owns the luxurious Caribbean island. The entire island operates like a resort and can accommodate up to 28 guests. Sir Richard, 61, was staying in a villa about 100 yards away with his wife Joan and son Sam, 25, when the fire took place. However Holly, 29, Kate and her family were staying with Eve in the Great House, which was burned to the ground. The Virgin tycoon praised Miss Winslet for helping his mother to safety, and described the actress's children Mia, ten, and seven-year-old Joe as 'two of the bravest kids I've ever come across'. Eve Branson previously said how she, ‘would have got down those stairs all right on my own,’ and that Kate only picked her up because she was worried about her own kids. Eve said: ‘I think she was worried that I was holding up her children, so she picked me up and carried me.’ As reported in The Observer Magazine, Eve has been running the Eve Branson Foundation in Morocco for the past 16 years, helping local women in the villages of the Atlas Mountains to set up sustainable enterprises making craft items for sale. ‘I'm completely in love with Morocco,’ Eve told the magazine. ‘And these women, they've never really had the chance to make their own money.

"US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson has selected Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan and Webb Simpson as his three wildcard picks to face Europe at Gleneagles. Speaking in New York, Watson insisted the team wants to 'go back and make amends for what happened in Medinah two years ago'. The  US legend revealed he included Bradley because of his 'unbridled passion to play in the Ryder Cup team'. VIDEO Scroll down for Tom Watson makes his Ryder Cup wild card picks . Leader of the pack: Tom Watson wants to 'make amends for what happened at Medinah two years ago' Patriot games: Keegan Bradley was selected for his 'unbridled passion to play in the Ryder Cup' Perfect timing: Hunter Mahan's recent win at Barclays went some way in deciding his selection . Man for all seasons: Tom Watson selected Webb Simpson for his statistics in the last Ryder Cup . Bradley promised via satellite link-up not to hide any emotion when he competes on European soil as well as vowing to keep away from the Ryder Cup to continue his superstition of never touching a trophy he has not won. Mahan, who won The Barclays tournament last month, has enjoyed a rich run of form that has seen him top the greens-in-regulation statistics for three of the last four tournaments he has played in. He admitted that he could now 'breathe and sleep again' after taking the call from Watson that confirmed his place on the team. Simpson was Watson's final pick and agreed with his fellow team members that the US are searching for 'redemption for their collapse in Medinah in 2012. Leading from the front: Bubba Watson was first to qualify automatically for the US Ryder Cup team . Earlier Europe captain Paul McGinley had selected Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Stephen Gallacher as his additional picks. Former world No 1 Luke Donald was controversially left out despite being an integral part of recent European success - being on the winning team in all four Ryder Cups he has played in - the only man to enjoy such a record. Donald has also never lost a foursomes match when the competition has been played in Europe. Poulter, Westwood and Gallacher join the nine players who have already qualified automatically for a place in McGinley's side at golf's biggest showpiece, which starts on September 26 in Perthshire. Rory McIlroy, the Open and US PGA champion and world No 1, is the biggest name on an all-star European team which also contains US Open winner Martin Kaymer.

Also qualified are Henrik Stenson, Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, Thomas Bjorn and Graeme McDowell. 'I'm in a privileged position in that I had a variety of choices and it says a lot about the European Tour and the standards we have now in Europe, the quality of the picks I have and how far we've come over the years for me to have such an abundance of talent to choose from,' McGinley said. 'There are some real quality players who have performed incredibly well who are not going to make the team. It was a very difficult call to those guys involved but on the positive side I think we have three players that will add a lot to the nine already qualified who make the European team as strong as it needs to be to take on the might of America.'

"Disciplined: Victoria Wasteney, an occupational therapist, was found guilty of three counts of misconduct after she prayed with her Muslim colleague . A Christian NHS worker has been disciplined for 'bullying' a Muslim colleague by praying with her. Victoria Wasteney, an occupational therapist, was also condemned for inviting the woman to a sports day at her church. And a hearing found her guilty of a further count of misconduct: lending the colleague a book about a Muslim woman who converts to Christianity. The 37-year-old, who was suspended for nine months, has now been banned from discussing her faith at work and given a formal warning by East London NHS Foundation Trust that will remain on her record for a year. Challenging the measures, Miss Wasteney, from Essex, has blasted the NHS for being intolerant. 'I believe in tolerance for everyone,' she told the Telegraph. 'It certainly wasn't an attempt to convert her to Christianity,' she added. Miss Wasteney claims she invited the colleague to a number of church events after she showed an interest in the work they do against human trafficking. When the woman went on sick leave, she recommended a book about a Muslim converting that they had discussed at work. And when the colleague came into her office in tears over health problems, Miss Wasteney claims she told her to draw on her faith, before they prayed together. However, in June 2013, Miss Wasteney was told she had received a formal bullying complaint and would have to be suspended while the accusations were investigated. 'Intolerant': Miss Wasteney has blasted East London NHS Foundation Trust for being intolerant as she launches legal action against the disciplinary measures, which has banned her from discussing her faith . In February, a hearing upheld three charges of misconduct. She is now challenging the ruling with the support of the Christian Legal Centre. Contacted for a statement, a spokesman for East London NHS Foundation Trust refused to comment on individual cases.","Victoria Wasteney, an occupational therapist, found guilty of 'bullying'

"It's not often you see Olivier Giroud come to the rescue, but he was so effective in that second half against Everton. I’m not sure Alexis Sanchez will work in that lone striker role just yet and Giroud did well when he came on. It’s only his fourth goal against a top five side in the Premier League — two of the others also came against Everton and the fourth against Liverpool — and that is something he has to work on. Making a difference: Olivier Giroud celebrates his fine header against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday . Physical presence: Arsenal immediately offered more going forward after the Frenchman's introduction . Ups and downs: Giroud held the ball up well for the Gunners but did miss a fine chance soon after coming on . No player has scored more headed goals in the Premier League since the beginning of last season than Giroud. He needs to make more contributions in the big games, and that starts this week against Besiktas. With Aaron Ramsey suspended, Giroud will be a key player if they want to qualify for the Champions League. But if he gets injured, Arsenal do look short on options up front. Heading in the right direction: Giroud's header grabbed Arsenal a point after they had been two goals down . RIGHT-BACKS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT . With Glen Johnson failing to impress at the World Cup and Kyle Walker not progressing quickly enough, Roy Hodgson will hope someone can make the England right back spot their own. The good news is that with Calum Chambers, John Stones and Eric Dier, there are some exciting young players making their mark. The thing I like about all three is they are comfortable on the ball — something that’s so important in the modern game — and they are versatile. On the scoresheet again: Dier has scored in each of Tottenham's Premier League games so far this campaign . I was at White Hart Lane on Sunday and I was very impressed by Dier. Yes, he has scored two good goals in two matches, but it’s his all-round game that is making him stand out. 2 - In just two appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side Dier has scored more goals than any Spurs defender did in the whole of 2013-14. He looks a good athlete and is clearly happy playing in a variety of positions. His dad was a tennis player so he’s got a good sporting background and Tim Henman, who knows the family, says Eric is not your average footballer — he is polite and a well-rounded young man. He’s made an excellent start but — and there’s always a ‘but’ with young players — we’ll find out a lot more about him if he faces the likes of Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling against Liverpool next Sunday. ALLARDYCE'S RAID ON THE PALACE . After all the drama of last season, Sam Allardyce will be pleased with how his team has started this one. He talks about how much pressure he is under but if they keep producing performances like Saturday’s, that pressure will disappear. His side were unlucky not to get something at home to Spurs on the opening weekend and were excellent against Palace. They did to Palace what Palace did to other teams last year under Tony Pulis — beat them with good, efficient football. As for the home team, after all the chaos of last week, they looked rudderless. They need to get a manager in there as soon as possible to take charge. Palace lost nine of their first 10 fixtures last season. If they’re not careful and don’t get a new man in soon, they could beat that record and lose their first 10. Looking up: West Ham's impressive win against Crystal Palace has helped ease pressure on Sam Allardyce . NAISMITH THE UNSUNG HERO . Much has been made of Everton’s big-name players, but Steven Naismith is now a real unsung hero. Roberto Martinez started Romelu Lukaku on the right side, which left Naismith room to pop up in the middle. Naismith has been involved in seven goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances for Everton. He has scored five and assisted two during that time. He is now a master of finding himself in the right place at the right time, and he scored another good goal against Arsenal on Saturday. He was fortunate with the offside call, but it was a clever run and he finished his chance well, slotting the ball through Wojciech Szczesny’s legs. He is now one of Everton’s most valuable assets. Deserves credit: Everton attacker Steven Naismith has started the new season just how he finished the last . UNITED LACK A CUTTING EDGE . Another week and another disappointing Man United performance. You can see why they are desperate for the Angel di Maria signing to go through. When I played United you were almost more scared on the ball because if you lost it they would be all over you in seconds. This side just lack pace. Di Maria can help but I’m interested to see where he will fit in with Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 system. When a player like Di Maria becomes available, it’s no wonder United go after him. But it’s plain to see he is the signing they least need to make. Their priority has to be a defender and a deep-lying midfielder to dictate the play. Imminent arrival: Angel Di Maria is set to join Manchester United from Real Madrid in a move worth £65million . IT'S GROUNDHOG DAY AT FULHAM . Fulham were a farce last season, when they went through three managers in as many months.  But the way things are going, with three straight losses in the Championship, they could go through another three this time round.","France international proved his ability in the second half at Goodison Park .
Alexis Sanchez does not look comfortable playing through the middle, so Arsene Wenger should make Giroud the key man in that position .

"Danny Alexander today challenged Alex Salmond to a debate on Scottish independence ‘any time, any place anywhere’ accusing the Nationalist leader of ‘cowering in his bunker’. The Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury told the Mail that the First Minister should stop ‘hiding away’ and go head to head with him. The challenge came after Mr Salmond accused the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems of trying to 'bully' him with an unprecedented cross-party warning that an independent Scotland would not be allowed to keep the pound. Clash: Alex Salmond was challenged to a debate on the future of Scotland by Lib Dem Danny Alexander, the most senior Scot in the UK government . Mr Alexander dismissed the SNP's claims that an independent Scotland could . or should be able to share the pound as 'pure fiction'. Conservative Chancellor George Osborne insisted the pound was not like a CD collection to be divided in a 'a messy divorce' and Labour's Ed Balls accused nationalists of not living in the real world. It is a devastating blow for SNP First Minister Mr Salmond’s campaign to persuade the Scots to vote to break away, leading him to grumble that about a bid by the 'Westminster establishment to bully and intimidate'. Mr Salmond, the leader of the SNP, has challenged David Cameron to debate him. But the Prime Minister has declined on the grounds that the independence debate should be between Scots and amid fears in Downing Street that a Tory leader puts off Scottish voters. Today Mr Alexander accused the First Minister of cowardice for refusing to debate. Mr Alexander told the Mail that he – not Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael or No campaign leader Alistair Darling – is the most senior Scot in the British government and he should go head-to-head with Mr Salmond. Mr Osborne used a speech in Edinburgh to insist the currency was not like a CD collection to be divided up in the event of a 'messy divorce' Mr Alexander said: ‘I’d like to debate Alex Salmond. I will meet him any time, any place, anywhere. It’s time that Alex Salmond got out of his bunker and started to engage in the debate with people in Scotland, who have a vote in this referendum, who disagree with him. ‘I’m the most senior Scot in the UK Government. If he wants to debate the UK Government I am available any time. He’s welcome to come to the Highlands any time. ‘It’s about time that rather than hiding behind the bogus challenge to David Cameron. ‘It’s a way to avoid debate rather than seek it out. This has to be settled by people in Scotland. The participants in this debate should be people who have a vote. ‘I’ve offered to debate him. Alistair Darling—the leader of the Better Together campaign—has offered to debate him. He has refused. It’s pretty pathetic.’ Mr Alexander admitted that Unionists have failed to make a strong enough or a positive enough case. ‘We have to step up our argument because this is the most important decision facing our country. This is the most important decision we will make in my political lifetime. ‘The SNP’s argument is based on asserting things that simply aren’t true. They assert that the rest of the UK will sign up to a currency union. They assert that an independent Scotland will have much more money to spend on all the expensive promises they have made—and yet the opposite is the case.' Mr Osborne also visited BSW Timber in Cargo near Carlisle, but did not look like he was enjoying it . Mr Osborne said is clear that as Chancellor he could not recommend that the UK could share the pound with an independent Scotland . Conservative Chancellor George Osborne: The . evidence shows it wouldn’t work. It would cost jobs and cost money and . wouldn’t provide economic security for Scotland or for the rest of the . UK. People need to know – that is not going to happen.' Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander: 'This isn't bluff, or bullying, it's a . statement of fact. The SNP's claims that an independent Scotland could . or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction.' Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls: . 'You’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as Scotland is pulling . away from the UK. It won’t happen, I wouldn’t recommend it. Scotland . will not keep the pound if Scotland chooses independence.' The Scottish government wants to keep . the pound if there is a ‘yes’ vote in the independence referendum due to . take place in September. Scottish nationalists accused the ‘Westminster establishment’ of attempting to bully Scotland into rejecting independence – and threatening to refuse to assume their share of the UK’s debts in retaliation. Mr Salmond said: 'This is a concerted bid by a Tory-led Westminster establishment to bully and intimidate but their efforts to claim ownership of Sterling will backfire spectacularly. 'The stance of any UK government will be very different the day after a Yes vote to the campaign rhetoric we are hearing now.' But Mr Osborne used a speech in Edinburgh today to insist: 'If Scotland walks away from the UK, it walks away from the UK pound.' Mr Osborne went on: 'The Scottish government say “it’s as much Scotland’s pound as the rest of the UK’s”. They are like an angry party to a messy divorce. 'But the pound isn’t an asset to be divided up between the two countries after break-up as if it were a CD collection. 'The value of the pound doesn’t lie in the paper and ink that’s used to print it. The value of the pound lies in the entire monetary system underpinning it.' Mr Osborne insisted he wants Scotland to keep the pound and the economic security that it brings. But he added: 'It is clear to me I could not as Chancellor recommend that we could share the pound with an independent Scotland. 'The . evidence shows it wouldn’t work. It would cost jobs and cost money and . wouldn’t provide economic security for Scotland or for the rest of the . UK. 'I don’t think any . other Chancellor of the Exchequer would come to a different view. The . Scottish government says that if Scotland becomes independent there will . be a currency union and Scotland will share the pound. 'People need to know – that is not going to happen.' The Chancellor later visited Haas-Tek, an export-driven business in Lockerbie, Scotland that specialises in the relocation and installation of industrial machinery and equipment . The blunt warning from Mr Osborne was immediately matched by Mr Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who dismissed claims Scotland could keep the pound as 'pure fiction'. He said: 'A currency union would leave the rest of the UK highly exposed to fiscal and financial risks from a separate Scotland. 'As a Scot and as Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the UK Treasury, on the basis of this analysis, I couldn't recommend a currency union to the people of Scotland and my party couldn't agree to such a proposition for the rest of the UK. 'This isn't bluff, or bullying, it's a statement of fact. The SNP's claims that an independent Scotland could or should be able to share the pound are pure fiction. 'When we vote in September, no one in Scotland should vote for independence in the belief that we could keep the pound.' And Labour's Ed Balls added: 'It would be bad for Scotland, it would place an unacceptable burden on the UK taxpayer, it would repeat the mistakes of the euro area. 'In fact worse, you’d be trying to negotiate a monetary union as Scotland is pulling away from the UK. It won’t happen, I wouldn’t recommend it. Scotland will not keep the pound if Scotland chooses independence.' Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon accused Westminster parties of trying to 'bully' Scots . Ministers . have already said it is ‘unlikely’ that the rest of the UK would agree . to a currency union, but it is a major blow for Mr Salmond that all three main parties have gone further than that to rule out any such arrangement. Scots . deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘People won’t take kindly . to the Westminster establishment ganging up to try to bully Scotland in . the decision that we are being asked to take on the referendum.' She insisted reports that the . Chancellor would reject any deal that would allow Scotland to leave the . UK and keep the pound were a 'cack-handed, panicky campaign manoeuvre' ahead of that historic vote. Blair . Jenkins, chief executive of the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign, . told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the . 'best currency choice for an independent Scotland is to be in a currency . union with the rest of the UK'. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon . He said ruling that out before the referendum was a 'very extreme position being taken for the purposes of negotiation' by the pro-Union parties. Mr Jenkins insisted: 'It would be so clearly to the detriment of the rest of the UK to impose the additional costs, currency transactions, currency conversion, to threaten growth, to threaten jobs in that way. 'To go against what we know is the wishes of the majority of people in England, that Scotland should continue to use the pound after we vote Yes in September, would be ludicrous.' However Lib Dem former Scottish Secretary Michael Moore told the same programme that ruling out a currency union was 'the logical extension of the debate over the last year'.

"An Ohio teenager convicted in a Korean War veteran's killing has been ordered to spend the anniversary of the slaying in solitary confinement for as long as he's in prison. Seventeen-year-old Jordan Legg was sentenced to life in prison in the death of 84-year-old Thomas 'Shorty' Whitson in Orient. For at least one day a year, Legg will be pulled from his own prison cell and sent along to a place far more desolate and lonely: solitary confinement. Jordan Legg: The 17-year-old will spend the each anniversary of the killing of Thomas Wilson in a solitary cell . Senseless: Thomas 'Shortie' Wilson was killed by a group of five teens who wanted to steal his guns in order to buy drugs with the money . He won't be eligible for parole for at least 20 years. Legg pleaded guilty yesterday to a charge of aggravated murder for his role in the death of Whitson, who was shot to death as he slept in his favorite chair in the living room of his rural  home earlier this year. The judge ordered that as long as Legg is in prison, he will spend every March 30 — the anniversary of the murder — in isolation, left with nothing but his own thoughts about what he did, the damage he wrought and the lives he wrecked. Authorities say Legg was in a group that included Whitson's grandson who killed the farmer because they wanted to sell his guns for drug money. Pickaway County Common Pleas Judge P. Randall Knece told Legg he should be kept in isolation every March 30 to be alone with the thoughts of what he did. Legg, who had no relatives or friends with him in the courtroom, turned to the Whitsons and apologized. He said drugs ruined his life and now he realizes that he ruined others’, too. He said he hopes the family can forgive him someday. Remote: The teens broke into Mr Wilson's house. He was shot by his own grandson. Here, Mr Wilson can be seen getting out of his truck with his home in the background . The teen was part of a group of five who went to Whitson’s house about 1:30 a.m. that March night. Shaun Lawson, Whitson’s 30-year-old grandson, was the triggerman; he admitted he killed his grandfather with Whitson’s own .357 Magnum handgun. A jury convicted Lawson last month of aggravated murder and related charges. Knece sentenced him to life in prison. Whitson's grandson received life with no chance of parole.","Jordan Legg, 17, was part of a group of five teens who killed a Korean War Veteran in his own home .

"A rescue helicopter crashed yesterday when it tried to take off with too many Iraqi refugees on board. The pilot died and several children were injured in the drama on Mount Sinjar, where Yazidi and Christian civilians are besieged by Islamic State maniacs. The helicopter, which had been mobbed by desperate families, was brought down by sheer weight of numbers. Other aid flights – including one run by the RAF – have come under intense fire from the jihadi gunmen. Scroll down for video . Tears of relief: An Iraqi Air Force helicopter emergency aid delivery turned into a rescue mission today in northern Iraq . The RAF Hercules plane was shot at as it brought food and water to the refugees on Monday night. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are helping the refugees escape the mountainside, said the small-arms fire missed the cargo plane. Thousands of people have been trapped for more than a week on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq in blistering 50C heat without shelter, food or water. They have fought to scramble aboard the few helicopters bringing humanitarian supplies. In one case, a father and a mother threw their two young daughters across a crowd on to a helicopter which took the children to safety, leaving the two parents behind. And a man clung desperately to the side of another helicopter before losing his grip and plunging to his death. Desperate: A woman clings on to a departing aid helicopter . The dramatic footage shows the moment a desperate woman clung onto an aid flight as it departed Mount Sinjar following the delivery of aid . Special forces are believed to be on the mountain with British and American intelligence officers in direct contact with leaders of the refugees. Special phones were dropped from a Hercules in the first RAF mercy mission, on Saturday. When switched on, they connect directly to Kurdish-speaking British or US agents. A source said: 'They are talking to the people on the mountain, and the questions they are asking are: Where are you? How long can you survive? How much water do you have? Where are the IS fighters?' Mirza Dinnay, a UN relief worker, told the BBC yesterday: 'It's a genocide. You find what looks like hundreds of dead people. Fleeing: The military helicopter crashed on a mountain as it tried to provide aid to the 500,000-strong Yazidi population in Sinjar (pictured), near the Syrian border, as they flee Sunni militants of the Islamic State . Horrific: The refugees are trying to find safety after Isil gave them the ultimatum: convert to Islam or die . 'Thousands of people are trying to save themselves. 'You can imagine what it is like when you land among 5,000 people and can take only ten or 20, and everybody tries to get on the helicopter. 'It's a dangerous situation because everybody pushes each other. Many haven't eaten for around nine days and they are living under the hot sun. 'Three days ago one man tried to get into the helicopter but he couldn't manage it. 'He then clung to the side as we took off but we couldn't help him get inside and within one or two minutes we were flying at around 100 metres, he fell down. Like in a Hollywood film, he died.' On another aid flight, there were chaotic scenes as an Iraqi army helicopter pilot agreed to let a handful of refugees on board but then relented and let 50 people including young children rush on – even though the aircraft has a passenger capacity of 15. The weight was too great for the helicopter to take off, until five men got out. The pilot, Major General Ahmed Saadi, told ITV News: 'I thought, God will be with us.' The picture was the same elsewhere on the mountain when a helicopter delivered food, shoes, nappies and condensed milk to a group seen waving makeshift white flags. It took away just 20 refugees, many seen weeping for loved ones they were forced to abandon. Some of those fleeing spoke of dozens of unburied bodies of people on the mountain who lost their battle for survival. The second RAF aid drop, on Monday night, contained more phones and also GPS equipment to help organise future aid drops. The RAF and Americans have between them delivered 20,000 gallons of water and 85,000 meals, plus 1,000 solar lanterns that can also be used to recharge mobile phones. Last night a government source said ministers were 'hardening up' plans to evacuate Mount Sinjar: 'We are working as fast as we can. It's a complicated operation.'","Russian-built Mi-17 helicopter crashed as too many tried to climb aboard .

"One of the Islamic State terror group's key financier was director of a Muslim faith school in Birmingham, it was claimed today. Prominent Islamic cleric Dr Nabil al-Awadi, a naturalised Kuwaiti, was partly resident in the UK until last year, living in Brixton, south London. Until February 2013, the Sunni was a director of the independent Al-Birr school in Birmingham, which was founded in seven years ago. Dr Nabil al-Awadi, a naturalised Kuwaiti, was a director of the independent Al-Birr school in Nechells, Birmingham. He is believed to have close links to the Islamic State group . Now he is president of the Kuwait Scholars' Union, which has reportedly channelled tens of millions of dollars to the Islamic State and other jihadi groups in Iraq and Syra. Earlier this month Dr  al-Awadi was stripped of his Kuwaiti citizenship along with nine other Kuwaitis, after the state cited 'security reasons'. He has also been accused by other prominent clerics in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia of using donations to fund the Islamic State. Dr al-Awadi, who is also reportedly close to the Muslim Brotherhood, claims he is part of a collective fundraising campaign for Syria by Kuwaiti charities . In June he said: 'Pressure has been put on me to stop collecting aid to Syria,' adding that directives from the Kuwaiti government 'were clear: Syria is over'. But he said money is still finding its way through back channels. The independent Al-Birr school in Nechells, Birmingham, was founded in 2007 and was rated 'satisfactory' Reyaad Khan (left) and Abu Muthana Al Yemeni (right) appeared in an Islamic State, then known as ISIS, recruitment video . The £1,500-a-year mixed school he was a director of has also been accused of having close links to the radical Al-Muntada Trust, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The London-based trust has attracted controversy in the past for giving a platform to radical clerics. It also attracted scrutiny when it was alleged some of its funds have ended up in the hands of Boko Haram, the militant Islamist group in Nigeria. The trust said it has never had any connection with Boko Haram and that it condemns terrorism in all its forms. In July 2012, it ran a conference with al-Awadi and another jihadi cleric, Muhammad al-Arifi, who has now been banned from Britain. Al-Arifi allegedly groomed Nasser Muthana and Reyaad Khan, two young Cardiff men who became the first Britons to appear in an IS propaganda video. The trust has said it has no links to terror organisations and says it is 'delivering much needed aid to refugees in bordering countries'. Khalid Mahmood, MP for Birmingham Perry Barr, the Sunday Telegraph: 'For too long this country has tolerated in its midst people who are actively working to destroy us and everything we stand for. 'With the rise in the threat level, we can simply no longer allow it.' The Al-Birr school's last available Ofsted report, in 2010, rated the school as 'satisfactory'. At that time it had 75 pupils, 41 were boys and 34 girls. The school was not available for comment today.","Prominent Islamic cleric Dr Nabil al-Awadi was partly resident in the UK .
