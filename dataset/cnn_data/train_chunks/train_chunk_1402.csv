"Flight delays to and from UK airports totaled 32 years and 8 months in 2014. Though an average delay of 40 minutes may not seem incredibly long, it definitely adds up - to the equivalent of the time it would take to make almost 4,000 trips to the moon. To be considered 'late' by the Civil Aviation Authority, a flight must take off more than 15 minutes after its scheduled departure time. Flight delays to and from UK airports over the last year have totalled over 32 years or 285,000 hours . Flightcompensation.com, the flight delay compensation specialists, looked at over 1.7 million flights landing and departing at UK airports last year. Of these, 432,695 took off more than 15 minutes after their scheduled departure time with delays totalling 17,134,838 minutes. The time wasted by passengers waiting for these flights is equivalent to almost 12,000 days or 1,700 weeks. Flightcompensation.com looked at over 1.7 million flights landing and departing at UK airports in 2014 . In this time, you could study for 10 Bachelor degrees, cross the Atlantic on the Queen Elizabeth 2 almost 2,400 times or watch the entire five seasons of Breaking Bad (again!) over 6,000 times. A spokesperson for flightcompensation.com said: 'Flight delays can have considerable knock-on consequences for passengers. 'We've secured compensation for people who have missed weddings, funerals, operations, and even days of their honeymoon due to late-running planes. 'There's often a financial cost as well as the time cost of being delayed. Thankfully, air passengers delayed by more than 3 hours may be entitled to up to €600 in compensation . 'We have people come to us time and time again who have been left out of pocket by extra parking charges, paying out for pricey food and drink at the airport and having had to take extra time off work.' There is some good news, however. Air passengers delayed by more than three hours may be entitled to up to €600 per person (approx. £470) provided the late-running was not due to 'extraordinary circumstances'.","In 2014, flight delays to and from UK airports totalled over 32 years .
On average, each flight was delayed just 40 minutes - but it adds up .
To be 'late,' the CAA says a flight must run 15 mins behind schedule ."
"Britain is sending more than £2million in aid to Argentina – even as Buenos Aires cranks up its hostility over the Falklands. The revelation provoked a furious reaction from Tory MPs last night and is an embarrassment for David Cameron, who only last month was accusing Argentina of ‘shameful’ attempts to bully the islands. To mark the 180th anniversary of British rule of the Falklands yesterday, the Argentine government issued a five-page rant by foreign minister Hector Timerman, in which he accuses the UK of ‘colonial and military occupation of Argentine territory’. Joy: Falklanders celebrate last year's referendum result in which they voted to remain under British rule . Mr Timerman said that after years of UK defence cuts, Argentina is no longer afraid of our defence forces. ‘The lion roars, but does not inspire fear any more,’ he claimed. He highlighted Mr Cameron’s bid to intervene in the Syrian conflict last year as evidence of Britain’s ‘aggression’. And he directly criticised the Prime Minister’s Christmas pledge to defend the Falklands. He said: ‘As a corollary to a  year in which the British Government issued threats to several independent countries, to such an extent that the British Parliament itself had to reject its attempts to launch military actions in the Middle East, the British Government devoted a paragraph of its Christmas address to the military defence of the Malvinas Islands, forgetting – if the British Government was ever able to appreciate it – the peace message that Christmas should inspire. ‘Perhaps this was the expression of a failed attempt to confuse the world as to the colonial and military occupation of Argentine territory, and the result of the lack of legal and historical arguments.’ Islas Malvinas is the Spanish name for the Falklands. The then Argentine junta invaded the islands in 1982 before being kicked out by a British taskforce. Mr Cameron sanctioned a referendum last year which saw the overwhelming majority of islanders vote to remain British. Argentina stepped up its harassment of the Falklands last year, including threatening oil executives who approve exploration in its waters with  15-year jail terms.

Malvinas in Spanish, in 1982 before being kicked out by a British . taskforce .

A Royal Marine guards Argentinean soldiers captured at Goose Green as they await transit out of the area . Last night, Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger, a member of Parliament’s all-party group on the Falklands, said: ‘Why on Earth are we sending aid to Argentina? It is absolutely ridiculous. They are behaving outrageously towards the Falklands and they hardly need the money. ‘People will be rightly shocked that we are giving money to Argentina at a time when they are trying to stop our shipping from going to the Falklands and threatening to prosecute companies that explore for oil there.’ Fellow Tory Peter Bone said: ‘People will be appalled that we are sending aid to Argentina – a country that is making aggressive claims on the Falkland Islands. There can be no justification for it and it must stop.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said the figures underlined concerns the Government was more interested in meeting Mr Cameron’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of our income on aid than on ensuring it is well spent. He added: ‘This is further evidence the growing aid budget is too often wasted. ‘Ministers should stand up for Britain by axing aid to an already well-off country that has made it clear that it doesn’t deserve our support.’","Argentine government issues five-page rant about UK 'colonial occupation'

"Six of Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s senators are reportedly plotting to vote against him when it comes to the softening of Australia’s race hate laws. The senators are in favour of a proposed bill, put forward by Family First senator Bob Day, that weakens the Racial Discrimination Act by removing the words ‘insult’ and ‘offend’ meaning no one can be prosecuted for insulting or offending someone over their race, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Mr Abbott backed down on plans to water down the Racial Discrimination Act in August last year after controversial changes to the act had been discussed for over six months. He was ridiculed by the opposition, ethnic leaders, the public and his own party over his u-turn. Scroll down for video . Six of Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s (left) senators are reportedly going to vote in favour of Family First senator Bob Day's (right) bill which proposes softening the Racial Discrimination Act . Mr Abbott first announced he wanted to reform section 18C of the act when journalist Andrew Bolt was found to have breached the act with a Herald Sun column. The political commentator fell foul to 18C for an opinion piece questioning the motives of lighter-skinned Aboriginal people. The amendments would have scrapped a prohibition on offending, insulting or humiliating individuals based on race. It’s now emerged that half a dozen of his senators still want the act reformed and are willing to cross the floor to make it happen. The Sydney Morning Herald says West Australian senator Chris Back, Queensland Liberal National Party senator Ian Macdonald and South Australian senator Sean Edwards are all in favour of voting to soften the race hate laws. Journalist Andrew Bolt  breached the race hate act with a Herald Sun column he wrote . Known supporters of Family First’s proposed bill also include Liberal senators Cory Bernardi, Dean Smith, Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm and senator Linda Reynolds . Attorney-General Brandis has previously said Australians have a 'right to be bigots' when defending his proposed changes to the law. However, the repeal of 18C, which was an Abbott government election commitment, has been widely criticised as a watering down of protections against racism. Section 18C of the act makes it unlawful to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. West Australian senator Chris Back wants the race hate laws softened . Queensland Liberal National Party senator Ian Macdonald also believes Australian's should be allowed to insult and offend people over their race, according to how he has indicted he will vote . South Australia senator Cory Bernardi speaking is a known supporter of softening Australia's race hate laws . Senator Linda Reynolds believes the law prevents 'free speech' rather than protects people . More than 5500 submissions flooded into the Attorney-General's office following the release of draft laws in March 2014. Only a handful were released publicly but the majority reportedly opposed the changes. Last year, the PM admitted the proposed changes to section 18C of the act had 'complicated' relations with ethnic groups. Coalition backbenchers joined the opposition, and Labor leader Bill Shorten says that's why the 'deeply unpopular' changes have been ditched. 'What is clear ... is that the Attorney-General has been rolled by his cabinet,' Mr Shorten told reporters. The government had been humiliated and embarrassed by the proposal, he said. 'This has been a dreadful waste of national energy,' the opposition leader added. The Australian Greens have also repeatedly questioned the motive behind the changes to the law. South Australian senator Sean Edwards has also reportedly announced he's in favour of changes to the law .","Six of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's senators will vote against him .

"Pressure: President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is mounting pressure on Falklands as her nation asks for more loans . Argentina is to set to demand £1.8 billion in loans from the World Bank, just days after the Daily Mail revealed British taxpayers were sending the country £2 million in foreign aid. Campaigners are urging the UK government to turn Argentina down for more loans after its leader Cristina Kirchner threatened to arrest oil explorers in the Falklands. Argentina's increasingly aggressive claims on the Falklands have alarmed British MPs. The UK abstained in a vote when Argentina asked for a loan from the World Bank last year. But there are fears that ministers may cave in under international pressure if Argentina strikes a less belligerent tone. Jonathan Isaby, the chief executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'As the Argentine Government comes knocking on the World Bank's door again, International Development Secretary Justine Greening must remain resolute and actively oppose any new loans.' He added: 'With the administration in Buenos Aires making repeated attacks on British interests and refusing to abide by its international obligations, it would be totally unacceptable for UK taxpayers' money to be used to underwrite further loans to Argentina. 'Ministers tell us that the Department for International Development will work ""in our national interest"" and this is exactly the kind of issue where their actions must reflect those words.' It is more than a decade since Argentina was forced to default over soaring debts, and the debilitating effects still linger. The nation is struggling to re-enter the global market - and still harbours around $9billion in debt to the Paris Club of creditor nations. It was on the brink of becoming an economic super power throughout the 90s after pegging the value of the peso to US dollars - but the government failed to address their growing debt crisis, which reached a climax in 2000. With more than half the population living below the poverty line, the IMF approved a $14million loan but it was too late. President de la Rúa resigned, prompting a string of four presidents in 10 days, before President Duhalde declared the currency devalued. Protest: Campaigners are urging ministers to block the loan after Kirchner threatened to arrest oil explorers on the British island . Since 2003, under Nestor Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, the economy has grown more than eight per cent. However, British taxpayers sent £2 million to the country in 2012, mostly through the Foreign Office, despite increasingly hostility between the two countries. A small amount of cash was also provided by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC), which is owned by the Department for International Development and which invests in companies in developing countries. Britain also sends around £7 million to the £50 million EU aid programme to Argentina and millions more through huge loans to the World Bank.","Campaign launched against loan as Argentina targets Falklands oil explorers .

"For one 22-year-old man in a wheelchair, dates with his beautiful girlfriend prompt a depressingly familiar question: 'Is that your nurse?' Columnist and author Shane Burcaw suffers from Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic disorder that causes the nerve cells responsible for controlling his body's muscle to deteriorate. Burcaw, who has been in a wheelchair since he was three-years-old, has been in a healthy relationship with Anna Reinalda for months, something that strangers have a hard time processing at first glance. Scroll down for video . Happy couple: On numerous occasions people have asked Shane Burcaw if his able-bodied girlfriend Anna Reinalda was his nurse or his sister while they are on dates together . Book launch: Columnist Shane Burcaw suffers from Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a genetic disorder that causes the nerve cells responsible for controlling his body's muscle to deteriorate . Burcaw, who has a blog called Laughing at My Nightmare and a book with the same name he published last fall, wrote a blog published by The Morning Call which details a few of the social misconceptions people have about his disorder. On numerous occasions people have asked Burcaw if his able-bodied girlfriend Anna Reinalda was his nurse or his sister. 'If I saw two young people out having a nice meal together,' Burcaw writes, 'I would probably assume that they were dating. This, however, does not seem to be the assumption people make when you throw a wheelchair into the picture.' He and his girlfriend often come up with humorous responses to people's questions about their relationship. 'My girlfriend has been asked if she was my nurse. We've gotten used to this bizarre, recurring question, and often find ways to poke fun at their ignorance,' he writes. The couple has a few hilarious and well-rehearsed comebacks up their sleeves. Mutual care taking: Shane Burcaw explains that each partner takes an extra step in learning the way in which to literally care for one-another . 'He's my dad,' Anna Reinalda will sometimes answer. 'I just pay her to be my friend,' Burcaw adds. The nerve condition has absolutely no effect on his ability to have a sexual relationship, but Burcaw explains that because of his condition he once believed he wasn't worthy of romantic affection. He once thought that if a girl were to go out on a date with him that she must be doing it out of pity. Luckily, he was wrong. 'Then college came and my brain opened up to the real truth. I met some spectacular people who helped me shake the notion that love was only for the physically-abled,' writes Burcaw in his heartwarming essay. 'Sure, I can't hold hands in the traditional sense, but we make it work. To be fair, our fingers look like a catastrophic train wreck once they are intertwined in the precise position that I can manage. I can't pick her up in my car, but so what? She enjoys driving and so we make it work,' he writes with  humor. Not only can disabled people in relationships have a strong bond, he believes the union  may be even better than relationships between two able-bodied people. 'Today, I live with the firm belief that an able/disabled relationship can be even more satisfying than your average romance,' he writes. Writer: Shane Burcaw writes a humorous blog on his experiences called Laughing at My Nightmare and also published a book by the same name . Each partner takes an extra step in learning the way in which to literally care for one another. Burcaw describes his first date with Anna in which she learned the ways she'd need to help him with tasks when they were together. He though she might be turned off by the notion of cutting his meatloaf and helping him take sips of his drink. She promised Burcaw she was excited to learn about the ways she could assist him. 'There is something profoundly intimate about a promise like that. On my end, I felt a deep sense of serenity that could only be attributed to trusting her with my care,' he writes. Even though his relationship may seem bizarre to strangers who observe him, to him it seems perfectly natural. 'That is why I get confused when strangers assume that she isn't my girlfriend, because to us it has always seemed so normal. It is fun and it is silly and it is beautiful, and we never think twice about the fact that our relationship is abnormal in any way,' he writes. 'We simply make it work,' he concludes.

"Two more women accused Bill Cosby . Thursday of drugging them decades ago when they met him as . young models, and one said he sexually assaulted her, as more of . his performances were canceled. More than a dozen women have publicly accused Cosby of . sexual misconduct in recent months, in a controversy that has . tarnished the image of the actor and comedian best known as the . lovable father figure on the 1980s sitcom The Cosby Show. Cosby denies the allegations of sexual assault, many of which are decades old and fall outside the statute of limitations for criminal or civil cases. Scroll down for video . More allegations: Linda Brown (left) and Lise-Lotte Lublin (center) are seen Thursday with their lawyer Glorida Allred (right) givin a press conference about allegedly being assaulted by Bill Cosby decades ago . Bad memories: Brown (center) tearfully told reporters how she met Cosby in 1969 in Canada and went to his hotel suite where he gave her a soft drink that caused her to black out . Familiar scenario: Brown (pictured in photo as a model) said when she woke up, she was naked next to Bill Cosby in bed . Brown was joined by fellow retired model Lise-Lotte Lublin (left), who accused the comedian of drugging her while performing in Las Vegas in 1989 . Linda Brown and Lise-Lotte Lublin came forward Thursday . as the latest women to bring public accusations against Cosby at . the Los Angeles office of attorney Gloria Allred, who . acknowledged it was too late for them to sue Cosby. Brown told reporters she met Cosby in 1969 in Canada and . went to his hotel suite where he gave her a soft drink that . caused her to black out. She said that when she woke up, she was . naked next to him in bed. 'I couldn't move or speak. I felt paralyzed, he flipped me . over and sexually assaulted me,' Brown said. 'I felt like a rag . doll and like a real-life blow-up doll for him.' Lublin said she met Cosby in 1989 at a hotel in Las Vegas . and that he asked her to perform an improvisation on the pretext . of evaluating her acting. The comedian gave her two alcoholic . drinks that caused her to feel disoriented, she said. Lublin said that a short time later, he embraced her. She . said her memory of the incident was hazy and that she remembered . waking up at her home in the area and not knowing how she got . there. Allred said Brown and Lublin believed Cosby drugged them, . which other women in media interviews have also said happened to . them in encounters with the comedian. In an emotional press conference held Thursday, Linda Brown recounted how in 1969, when she was 21 years old, her modelling agency set her up with Cosby on a dinner date while he was performing in Toronto, reported the New York Daily News. Trio: Lublin (far right) pictured with her sister (center) and Bill Cosby in the 80s . Beauties: Lublin (left) and Brown (right) both worked as models decades earlier . The one-time cover girl is best known for being the first model to appear on TV dressed only in a bra in a 1969 Wonderbra commercial. Brown recalled that Cosby showed her pictures of his family over dinner, and then offered to give her a ride home in his limousine. On the way home, the comic allegedly told her he needed to stop by his hotel to pick up a present for someone, and he invited her up to his suite. TV history: Brown is best known for being the first model to appear on TV dressed only in a bra in a 1969 Wonderbra commercial . According to Brown, Cosby handed her a beverage and left the room to make a phone call. 'I took a sip and blacked out,' the woman recalled, adding that when she awakened, she inexplicably found herself lying naked under the covers beside Cosby. She said she left the room feeling 'dirty, ashamed and embarrassed.' Lisa-Lotte Lublin described a similar experience involving Bill Cosby, which allegedly occurred in Las Vegas in 1989, when she was 23 years old. According to the ex-model, she and Cosby were in his Elvis Suite at the Hilton Hotel when he offered her two drinks and proceeded to pet her hair. A short time later she passed out, but she remembered the color of the walls in the room and a flood of bright light. Gloria Allred, who represents the two women, along with seven other Cosby accusers, said Brown and Lublin have decided to come forward years later because they were concerned for their reputations and afraid to take on the wealthy and powerful comedian. Allred reminded reporters that while it was too late to hold Cosby accountable for Lublin's alleged assault, he could still face criminal prosecution in Canada, where there is no statute of limitations. The high-profile attorney also revealed that she knows more women who may be willing to come forward with accusations against him in the future. Under fire: Cosby, 77, had a show scheduled for Thursday in Bakersfield, California, and another in Pittsburgh February 21, but both have been scrapped . Cosby's lawyer has called those and similar claims 'discredited' and 'defamatory.' His attorney did not immediately . return emails Thursday. Cosby, 77, had a show scheduled for Thursday in Bakersfield, . California, but in a statement earlier this week, he postponed . it. A message posted to the website of The Fox Theater states the Thursday night show has been postponed and the venue does not have a new date for the performance. The theater did not provide a reason and says it will provide refunds to ticketholders. His February 21 show at Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh was also . canceled by what venue officials described as the result of a . mutual agreement with Cosby. Heinz Hall issued a short news release Tuesday saying the show 'has been canceled by mutual agreement with Cosby's presenter and Heinz Hall management.' No specific reason was given. The venue's website indicated that fewer than half the available tickets had been sold for the show at the 2,676-seat venue. Refunds will be issued for tickets to the Pittsburgh show.","Former models Linda Brown and Lisa-Lotte Lublin have come forward accusing Cosby of drugging them .

"It was Australia's most expensive penthouse, a high-rise paradise with its own pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque that sold off the plan in 2006 for almost $17 million. Now, it's an empty shell after a deal to sell to one of Australia's richest men fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. And the massive four-floor apartment has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls ceiling - and yes, even the kitchen sink - in an effort to attract a new buyer who can stamp their personality on the Gold Coast property. 'Aurora - The Soul Penthouse' on the glitzy Gold Coast is ready to get a glamorous makeover again, after being stripped bare. Just about every mod-con is long gone ahead of the international auction planned for next month. If you have the cash, here's your chance to start form the ground up, high above the ground. McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood says the 'blank canvas' is the new appeal of this four-level 1,040 square metre property. 'It is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out . 'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' Yesterday: 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting a big buyer's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added. The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said. Mr Ledgerwood said that the auction, will be held for receivers PricewaterhouseCoopers and is set to happen March 7. 'There has been plenty of local and international interest.' All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through. The stripped version goes under the hammer in March. Now the appeal is that buyers will have a 'blank canvas' to work with . McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast' Development company Juniper Property Holdings has been locked in a bitter legal battle with one of Australia's richest men, Charlie Caltabiano, who is believed to have agreed to purchase the property in 2006 for the then record price of $16.85million. That agreement to purchase expired last year and the group has sought to keep the $1.685 million deposit along with a further $3.8 million in interest plus damages. Mr Caltabiano, however, is fighting the claims, alleging misrepresentation. As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . As it is now. The luxurious pool-side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . 'This is the first time I can remember where a penthouse like this is available, be it on the (Gold) Coast or not, where buyers can start with a blank canvas in an already complete and amazing building,' said Mr Ledgerwood. It may well have been stripped back - but the penthouse has plenty of appeal, he said. That includes: . It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'. 'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said. At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland . Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area has been cleared out ahead of the auction . 'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.' The successful bidders will get plenty of input on how to do justice to the prime position. 'The three parties we've commissioned have worldwide experience in working with buyers who own iconic locations,' said Mr Natoli in reference to firms DBI (the original designer), Blainey North and Bayden Goddard Design. These groups have been brought in to come up with alternative lay-outs for potential buyers, he said. 'The three companies have provided us with their vision for the penthouse's future look.' Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood .

"Having a name starting with the letters A to M is just as important as the picture you choose for an online dating profile, a study has shown . Forget your chat-up lines and ditch the expensive aftershave, because scientists say the secret to dating is far simpler. The key to finding love is all in a name, it seems. A team of researchers has discovered that people with names earlier in the alphabet are more likely to be romantically successful. After carrying out an extensive search of studies in the fields of psychology and sociology, as well as computer, behavioural, and neurocognitive sciences, the scientists from Queen Mary University of London found that names are vital for first impressions. Their study, published in the Evidence Based Medicine journal, suggests that having a name starting with the letters A to M is just as important as the picture you choose for an online dating profile. Professor Khalid Khan, who led the research, said: 'Alphabetically ordering things has been around for centuries. 'Research has shown that this accident of initial letters has important influence on outcomes. 'A always comes first. Peoples are drawn to those at the top of any listing. 'Applied to online dating this means that those at the top of the listing get first bite of the attention from potential love-interests and so have a higher chance of being matched.' 'There is something in human nature that draws us to those at the top of any listing and this phenomenon, though not fully explained, has an impact on online dating. Perhaps we subconsciously give higher value to things that appear to be at the top of the pile.' He added: 'Research shows that people with names in top half alphabet paper to do better in education compared to those in lower half, on average. Amazon and Apple, successful companies begin with A. 'This does not mean that things lower down in the alphabet don't have a chance - Zara is a successful company too - it is just that on average their chances are lower.' The researchers said that the 'screen names' that people choose for an online dating profile are vital. Researchers found that people with names earlier in the alphabet are more likely to be romantically successful . Names with negative associations like 'Little' or 'Bug' should be avoided. They also said that group photos showing other people having a good time in their company, preferably with them right in the middle and touching someone else - but only on the upper arm - will help to convey friendliness, importance and status. A flattering photograph remains important in securing a date – particularly one that features a genuine smile that crinkles up the eyes and possibly a tilt of the head. Women seeking men should wear red as this is likely to boost the level of interest, the study suggests. Females also find a man more attractive when they see other women smiling at him, they concluded.","People with names starting with letters A to M more likely to be successful .

"Alleged Sydney terrorists Omar al-Kutobi and Mohammad Kiad are being protected from other prisoners inside Silverwater Jail, after being subjected to threats since their arrival. Al-Kutobi, 24 and Kiad, 25, were arrested on terror charges on Tuesday and did not apply for bail during a brief video link hearing in Central Local Court on Thursday. Daily Mail Australia has learned that they are now being held in protective custody inside Silverwater, which has a long-held reputation for being among the toughest prisons in New South Wales. A police source revealed that 'these guys are typically cared for in a different way to the general population’. 'Anyone like them, who are accused of these sorts of offences, will come under particular attention (in jail).' Scroll down for video . Mohammad Kiad, 25 (left), and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, were arrested on terror charges in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield in Sydney's south-western suburbs on Tuesday. They are believed to be in protective custody inside Silverwater Correctional Complex after being the subject of death threats . Kiad is said to be a keen weightlifter, the 25-year-old removalist sharing selfies of himself at the gym . Accused pair al-Kutobi and Kiad ham it up in a photo while relaxing at home. Prison officials would not be drawn if the pair are now 'under watch' in jail after threats from other inmates . Silverwater Jail - is considered one of the toughest correctional facilities in Australia - it's where alleged terror suspects Mohammad Kiad and his flatmate Omar al-Kutobi are being held until their March court appearance and are believed to have been subjected to threats by fellow prisoners since they were taken into custody . However, Correction Services refused to be drawn on the matter when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. ‘Due to legal advice we are unable to provide any detail because of privacy concerns, so we can neither confirm nor deny the claims.’ Nor would they comment on suggestions the pair had expressed concern for their safety behind prison walls or that a third party had made a request on their behalf to have them protected from harm from the general population. Kiad and his Iraqi born housemate Omar, al-Kutobi, were arrested in their shared squalid granny flat on Tuesday, where a police raid allegedly uncovered a machete, a hunting knife, an Islamic State flag and a video featuring both the men, with one recorded making threats of carrying out a terrorist attack. Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video. The pair appeared briefly via video from Silverwater Prison, dressed in their prison greens, on Wednesday. Their legal aid appointed barrister, Deone Provera, said they will be seeking bail when the matter returns to court on March 16. Kiad was arrested on Tuesday with his flatmate al-Kutobi, just hours before an alleged plan to undertake a beheading attack in central Sydney . Kiad was granted a visa under the family and spousal visa arrangements and is believed to have been receiving welfare payments . Crown prosecutor Michael Allnut leaves Fairfield Local Court after the first mention on Wednesday of charges against Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25. They have both been charged with one count of ""do act in preparation/planning for terrorism act"" and refused bail after being arrested in anti-terror raids in Sydney's south-western suburbs . Government investigations into how al-Kutobi and Kiad were able to reside in Australia and receive welfare payments continues. It's been claimed al-Kutobi, an Iraqi national, flew into the country on a fake passport and was given a protection visa. All this comes amid claims, by some lawyers, that statements made by Prime Minister Abbott in parliament could prejudice a fair trial. Adam Houda has told the ABC that 'he (the Prime Minister) wants to milk this situation politically for all it's worth'. 'He's poisoning the minds of potential jurors out there. We have rules for a reason, to ensure fairness in courts.' The PM's office, however, insists he revealed details surrounding their arrest, with the full knowledge and consent of the Australian Federal Police. During Question Time in parliament, Mr Abbott gave a graphic description of the disturbing video. He explained that one of the men made threats about carrying out an attack on Australia and stabbing victims in their 'kidneys' and 'livers', whilst 'kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him'. The PM also informed parliament that the man on the video said: 'I swear to almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We only are you, stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks.' Their Fairfield home, a granny flat in Sydney's south-west (pictured). The pair was living in squalid conditions and al-Kutobi, it's been revealed, flew into Australia in 2009 as an Iraqi national using another person’s passport . The Prime Minister read from a statement in parliament, describing information surround the pair's arrest. 'Kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him, one of those arrested said this: 'I swear to almighty Allah we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia',"" Mr Abbott said . However, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) has also issued a statement about Mr Abbott's comments, saying they would not affect their role. It reads: 'Given the concern for public safety that attaches to allegations of terrorism, senior government officials are often briefed on major counter-terrorism investigations.' 'They sometimes choose to provide additional information to the public as they see fit. 'The CDPP forms its own view about the evidence in any given case. In stark contrast to the images of him in gym gear and shiny pants, other pictures show Kiad wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces . 'The comments made by the Prime Minister in this case will not have any impact on the CDPP's role or function, especially as this is in the very early stages of the matter, and any jury trial is unlikely to take place until much later in the year.' Social media accounts of one of the two men charged with plotting a terrorist attack involving large knives revealed he was a fashion-loving weightlifter with a keen eye for expensive jewellery. Pictures of Kiad on his Facebook page, who was believed to be working as a removalist until his recent sacking, show him sporting expensive watches and suits as well as taking numerous selfies while at the gym. In contrast to the snaps of him in shiny sparkling tight pants, other pictures show him wearing traditional white Islamic clothing and headpieces. Al-Kutobi was granted citizenship in 2013 and was apparently studying to be a nurse.

The Army's approval of Manning's transition was first reported by USA TODAY. In an Army memo, the commandant of Fort Leavenworth's Disciplinary Barracks, Col. Erica Nelson, wrote: 'After carefully considering the recommendation that (hormone treatment) is medically appropriate and necessary, and weighing all associated safety and security risks presented, I approve adding (hormone treatment) to Inmate Manning's treatment plan.'

During her trial, a Navy psychiatrist testified that Manning suffers from gender identity disorder, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. After her conviction, Manning sued the federal government for access to hormone therapy treatment. She was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union. Lawyers argued that Manning was as at a high risk of suicide unless she received the treatment. In addition to the therapy, Manning also wanted the right to dress and live as a female.

"DICTATORS' DINNERS . by Victoria Clark & Melissa Scott . (Gilgamesh Publishing £14.95) How many cookery books do you have? Lots? More than lots? An absolutely ridiculous number? Power-hungry: Ugandan tyrant Idi Amin . The problem is that there’s always one more that you have to have, even when you think you have collected the set. Dictators’ Dinners is subtitled A Bad Taste Guide To Entertaining Tyrants, and if there’s even the smallest chance of you having to feed Robert Mugabe or Kim Jong-Un one evening, you are going to need it on your shelf. Victoria Clark and Melissa Scott have approached their task with great clarity and simplicity. They profile 26 dictators, all from the 20th century, from Hitler and Mussolini in Europe, to Pol Pot in the East and ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier in the West. They describe their culinary preferences, and then give us the recipe for one of their favourite dishes. Rarely, if ever, have the depths of human depravity and haute cuisine been so stylishly combined in a single book. Stalin enjoyed long, severely alcoholic meals: when he referred to ‘a bite to eat’, he was usually talking about a six-hour feast, cooked by his favourite chef, Vladimir Putin’s grandfather. After one such snack, Marshal Tito vomited in his jacket sleeve; after another, Nikita Khrushchev was discovered to have wet his bed. Hitler was, as we know, a vegetarian, but more because he had a tender concern for animals than because he didn’t like the taste. On several occasions in the Thirties, he wolfed down fledgling pigeon stuffed with tongue, liver and pistachio nuts, and reportedly remarked that there was ‘nothing better than a liver dumpling’. He had 15 food-tasters, and only if none of them had dropped dead within 45 minutes of tasting a dish was it deemed safe for the Fuhrer. He must have eaten a lot of lukewarm food. How did paella become Spain’s national dish? Because it was thought to be General Franco’s favourite, so no Madrid restaurant could afford to leave it off the menu, just in case he popped in for lunch. Nicolae Ceausescu travelled with a mobile laboratory to analyse any food he was offered. If it hadn’t been screened and approved, he shovelled everything he was served at formal banquets straight on to the floor and kicked it as far away from him as possible. Saddam Hussein had 20 palaces, and kitchen staff at each of them prepared three meals a day for him whether he was there or not. He had his eldest son beaten up and thrown in jail for clubbing one of his food‑tasters to death. His usual breakfast was camel milk with bread and honey. After Hussein was captured in 2003, a nearly empty box of Bounty bars was found in his hideout. Colonel Gaddafi liked camel milk, too, but it may have been the cause of his legendary flatulence. On a visit to his tent in 2004, Tony Blair was advised not to accept a glass, lest he be similarly afflicted. Hastings Banda of Malawi favoured mopane worms, the large caterpillars of the emperor moth, especially when dried and eaten as a snack like crisps. Both Emperor Bokassa of the Central African Republic and Idi Amin of Uganda were rumoured to eat human flesh. Amin denied it: ‘It’s too salty for me.’ Instead he ate up to 40 oranges a day. One state banquet he hosted included bee larvae, green bush crickets, cicadas, flying ants and locusts. (Wash your crickets thoroughly and fry them with a little onion and garlic, with salt and pepper to taste.) Mao Tse-tung was a chronic insomniac who regularly took sleeping pills before dinner and fell asleep while he was eating, leaving attendants to fish any remaining food from his mouth. Ferdinand Marcos’s shoe-crazed wife Imelda, flying to Rome in their private plane, ordered the pilot to turn back because they had forgotten to bring cheese. According to his sushi chef, Korea’s Kim Jong-Il ‘enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing’. Maybe the most serious foodie dictator, though, was Fidel Castro, who was extolling the virtues of plain, fresh ingredients decades before Jamie Oliver was born. His favourite soup involved a plain, fresh, endangered species — the sea turtle. Clark and Scott reproduce the recipe here but, happily, leave the turtle out of it.

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, on Thursday night denied planning to seek legal action to gain access to his girlfriend’s hospital bedside, despite previous reports to the contrary. Earlier in the day, Bobbi's cousin Jared Brown suggested in an interview with 11Alive that Gordon was preparing to take the matter to court. Gordon's attorneys Randy Kessler and Joe Habachy released a statement on his behalf to set the record straight. 'In response to reports that Nick Gordon is taking legal action, he would like it to be clear, he is not. Mr. Gordon's only concern is the recovery of Bobbi Kristina,' read the statement. 'He remains in constant prayer for his companion and he hopes to be reunited with her soon. Despite the incredible public interest, we ask and hope that this request can be resolved privately by Mr. Gordon and the family.' Scroll down for video . Bobbi Kristina Bronw's cousin Jared Brown (left) claimed Nick Gordon (right) is planning to take legal action to get access to his comatose girlfriend's (pictured right) hospital bedside. His lawyers have since denied it . Ms Brown, 21, has been in a coma at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since January 31, when she was found face down in a bathtub . Bobbi Kristina's family, including father Bobby Brown and grandmother Cissy Houston, have been by her bedside at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta since she was discovered face down in a bathtub January 31. Gordon reportedly made an attempt to visit his girlfriend that first night, but instead he got into a physical confrontation with her relatives. Last year, Bobbi Kristina’s maternal aunt Marion Houston sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April. Jared Brown said he's been acting as a mediator between Gordon and Bobbi’s family. Banned: Gordon has not been allowed to see Bobbi. Her aunt obtained a restraining order against the boyfriend last year, accusing him of stalking her . Vigil: Bobbi Kristina's relatives, including her maternal grandmother, Cissy Houston (pictured), have been at her bedside for the past two weeks . Cissy Houston (left) and Bobbi Kristina's father, Bobby Brown (right), are pictured at the hospital . ‘We sit down and talk about things he wants my family to know and what we would love for Krissy to know, and that is that he loves her and is just waiting for her to wake up,’ he exclusively told the station 11Alive . Some of the 21-year-old woman's relatives have called on prosecutors to charge Gordon in connection to the bathtub incident. Last week, it emerged that police were investigating suspicious injuries found on Bobbi Kristina’s chest, as well as additional bruises on her mouth and face. Gordon reportedly told a documentary friend do his that hurt Bobbi's chest while performing CPR on her. Bobbi’s paternal aunt Leolah Brown said in an interview with Fox 5 Wednesday that she believes Nick Gordon will '110 per cent ' be charged with a crime. Go-between: Jared Brown (left) has been acting as a mediator between Gordon and his family, some of whom have called on prosecutors to charge the young man with a crime . It has emerged that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found . No one has been charged in the incident or named as a suspect, and Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations. It has also emerged that one of Nick and Bobbi’s neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found, according to a 911 call made by her security guard on January 23. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that one of the neighbors had reported a fight at the address. They said they saw people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse. He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were . Nick Gordon was taken in by Houston as a child and brought up as Bobbi Kristina's brother - but after Houston's death, they started a romantic relationship and last year, they claimed they had married. In the Fox interview, Leolah said she does not think Gordon has been a good influence on her niece. Jared Brown said plans are being made to take Bobbi off the ventilator and asked people to continue praying for a miracle.","Gordon has not been allowed to see Bobbi.

"The lawyer for Marion 'Suge' Knight says a video of a confrontation that ended in a fatal hit-and-run appears to show the former rap mogul was ambushed. Attorney David Kenner says he briefly reviewed the video obtained from a Compton burger stand, Tam's Burgers, and claims that the footage supports Knight's claims that he feared for his life that January night. Knight, 49, struck two men with his truck on Jan. 29 in the confrontation that left 55-year-old Terry Carter dead and Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan seriously injured. Ambushed: The lawyer for Marion 'Suge' Knight (photographed) says a video of a confrontation that ended in a fatal hit-and-run appears to show the former rap mogul was ambushed . Claims: Attorney David Kenner (photographed) says he briefly reviewed the video  and claims that the footage supports Knight's claims that he feared for his life that January night . 'In my estimate, what some of the video shows is that Mr. Knight was called there as part of an ambush to kill him, and what he did in driving out in the manner and way in which he did was to avoid being killed,' Kenner told the New York Daily News. He said that the alleged ambush involved five or more men and Knight left 'the only way he could without being killed.' Kenner said Wednesday that his firm has only had one day with the video but believes it will aid Knight's defense of murder, attempted murder, and hit-and-run charges. Victims: Knight struck two men with his truck on Jan. 29 in the confrontation that left 55-year-old Terry Carter (left) dead and Cle Shaheed 'Bone' Sloan (right) seriously injured . The attorney declined to discuss the video in detail, but TMZ reports that unidentified sources say the video shows Sloan -- whose foot was mangled in the incident -- pointing a gun at Knight shortly before the hit-and-run. Sloan's lawyer told the Daily News that the gang member-turned filmmaker was not in possession of a firearm of any kind at the time of the incident and the report is inaccurate. Police say that Knight never left the truck and appeared to intentionally hit the victims before fleeing the scene. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed that it has received video footage related to the incident, according to the Daily News, but could not comment on the video's details. Chest pains: Knight, pictured in court on Feb. 3, complained of having chest pains after his appearance and was rushed to the hospital where doctors discovered he had blood clots . Rap Sheet: Knight faces a long sentence in this case, and has a lengthy rap sheet spanning back to 1987 . Knight remains in jail and has pleaded not guilty. The rap mogul was out on bail in a separate robbery case and after he was charged in the hit-and-run incident his $2 million bail was revoked as authorities believed he was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses. Intimidate: Knight's $2 million bail was revoked as authorities believed Knight was a potential flight risk and could intimidate witnesses . Tam's Burgers: The hit-and-run took place at Tam's Burgers (photographed) and was reportedly the result of an argument 30 minutes before between Knight and others on the set of the upcoming N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton' Knight is the co-founder of Death Row Records, which once boasted Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg as its artists.

The toddler is seen enthusiastically singing completely different lyrics in a duet with her father while riding in the car. Most of her words center around unhappiness. 'Can't be happy,' she says, with her father responding,' why don't we know how to be happy?' Ashlynn says that no one can crack a smile because they're 'still mad'. She later adds that she wants to cry. 'Why do you want to cry?' her concerned father sings back. 'What if I give you candy, does that make you happy?' he then suggests.

"Death row inmates in Oklahoma could be executed by having a bag put on their head which is then filled with poisonous gas. Lethal injections will soon be phased out in the US state of Oklahoma after the necessary drugs have become difficult to obtain. Senators have now approved plans for inmates facing the death penalty, which is legal in the state, to instead be executed using nitrogen hypoxia gas. Death row prisoners will now be executed in Oklahoma using nitrogen hypoxia gas, pictured is the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester . But Mike Christian, a Republican representative in the Oklahoma legislature, said the state could avoid paying for a gas chamber, which would cost around £200,000, by using a mask or a bag over an inmate’s head. Whichever technique is used, the senate agreed that gassing prisoners with nitrogen hypoxia was less cruel. Mr Christian said inmates would experience an effect like that felt by pilots whose oxygen supplies fail at high altitude, adding: ‘The people who have experienced it to the point of unconsciousness said it was a euphoric feeling. I’d say it’s more humane.’ Drugs such as sodium thiopental, used to sedate prisoners, have been difficult and expensive to get hold of since the EU introduced a ban on exporting substances intended for lethal injections in 2011. Until now the method of execution in Oklahoma has involved anaesthetising the inmate with sodium thiopental, before injecting them with muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide then potassium chloride, which stops the heart beating. Drugs such as sodium thiopental, used to sedate prisoners, have been difficult and expensive to get hold of since the EU introduced a ban on exporting substances intended for lethal injections in 2011 (stock picture) Attempts to substitute scarce drugs with other substances have seen botched executions take place in Oklahoma and other parts of the US. Last year Clayton Lockett, who was convicted of murder, rape, and kidnapping in 2000, was given an untested cocktail of drugs via injection including the sedative midazolam. He was left writhing in pain for 45 minutes and died of a heart attack. Last month the execution of Charles Frederick Warner in Oklahoma lasted 18 minutes, during which he said: ‘My body is on fire.’ Warner, 47, was put to death for killing an infant in 1997. He was originally scheduled to be executed in April on the same night as Clayton Lockett, but state officials suspended executions in Oklahoma until an investigation was completed into what went wrong. Warner was injected with rocuronium bromide and potassium chloride, which is said to cause suffocation and burning sensations, as well as a paralytic which prevented him from moving.","Oklahoma senators have voted to use gas to execute death row inmates .

"The days of rocking up to the Qantas business class lounge in thongs and a singlet are seemingly over after the airline announced its lounge staff will soon be ensuring visitors ‘meet the appropriate standard’ of attire. Qantas will be keeping a closer eye on what you are wearing and will only allow you into their fancy waiting areas if you wearing ‘smart casual’ clothing from now April 1. However, the airline has refused to define exactly what is and is not allowed to be worn and each customer will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Signs will be put up outside the Qantas lounges  highlighting the policy. Helen Gray, Qantas' Head of Domestic Product & Service, told Daily Mail Australia: 'From April 2015, customers entering domestic Qantas Clubs and Business Lounges in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney will receive a friendly reminder about the smart casual dress guidelines that apply.' Qantas lounges have always had dress codes but they have not been strictly enforced before . People wearing thongs will probably no longer be allowed in the Qantas lounges around Australia . 'The vast majority of our members meet and exceed the guidelines, but we have had some feedback from customers that they want to see those guidelines apply to everyone. 'The dress guidelines for our lounges are the same as most restaurants and clubs.' Playing the role of bouncers, Qantas staff is allowed to use their ‘discretion' to determine if a visitor to the lounge meets the smart casual dress guidelines.’ Singlets, bare feet, and rubber thongs 'in most cases' will be deemed unacceptable in capital city  lounges. This will be the first time the dress code – which has always existed – is actively enforced. The decision has reportedly been made after feedback from customers concerned about the style inside the expensive lounges. High-vis clothing and work attire will still be allowed. If you have ever wanted to experience Qantas business class you'll have to dress the part . Men and women are encouraged to dress in smart casual attire if they want to get into the Qantas lounges . High-vis clothing and work uniforms are still be allowed in the lounges . The move comes after the airline announced they would be opening the doors to the business class lounge to people who never had the money or the points to use it before. They announced this week that customers will be able to combine their cash and air miles to experience how the other half fly. Frequent flyers who have points coming out of their ears have no need to panic about ending up in cattle class as the points-only upgrades will be processed first before the online bidding begins. However, economy passengers can only get involved in the Bid Now Upgrades if they receive an invite via an email seven days before departure. Bidder's offers can be modified or cancelled at any time up until 24 hours before departure, but passengers don't see each other's offers.

Qantas Loyalty CEO Lesley Grant said the system is designed for passengers who don't have a balance high enough to request an upgrade using points alone. 'For a member who doesn't have enough points to submit an upgrade request for their whole family, Bid Now Upgrades offers an alternative chance to travel at the front of the plane with their spouse and children using a combination of money and points,' she said. Ms Grant said the new system will not change the process or priority for frequent flyers submitting Classic Upgrade Rewards more than 24 hours out from their scheduled departure. 'This new initiative will in no way impact the chances of members securing a Classic Upgrade Reward - these will always be confirmed first regardless of their Frequent Flyer tier and they remain the best value option,' she said.","Qantas lounge's 'smart casual' dress code will now be enforced by staff .

"Doctors are seeing up to 116,000 bogus whiplash patients every month, a report by insurers reveals today. Nearly a million hours of GPs’ time is wasted annually by the 1.4million suspected fraudsters, says research by LV=. And as well as putting a strain on the already creaking NHS, false whiplash claims cost insurers over £2billion a year – adding an average of £90 to drivers’ premiums, according to the Association of British Insurers. Don't lie: Doctors are seeing up to 116,000 bogus whiplash patients every month. (Picture posed by model) The report found that Britain’s reputation as the ‘whiplash capital of the world’ is justified – 78 per cent of UK car accidents, in which one driver accepts liability, involves a compensation claim for whiplash. This is twice the Western European average. Doctors also remarked that the problem is becoming more widespread, with 43 per cent saying they now frequently see suspected feigned injuries, compared with 26 per cent in 2012. The research concludes: ‘The NHS is being put under increasing strain as more people attempt to claim compensation from exaggerated or invented injuries. ‘It is estimated that doctors are collectively seeing around 116,000 suspect cases a month, which is eating up close to a million surgery hours each year. ‘GPs report that dealing with these types of cases not only takes away valuable appointment time from genuine patients, but that additional surgery hours are lost dealing with the law firms and claims companies pestering them for paperwork.’ Shockingly, more than half – 52 per cent – of doctors said fraudsters have tried to pressure them into agreeing with them on their condition. The rise in dubious injuries comes despite legislation being introduced in 2013, which gave the courts new powers to throw out claims and banning lawyers from offering incentives. The report notes: ‘It appears that this has not had a long-term impact. The UK sees more compensation claims for whiplash injuries per car accident than any other Western European country.’ LV= claims director Martin Milliner said: ‘The cost of dealing with fraudulent claims not only pushes up the cost of car insurance for honest motorists but it also hurts the public purse.’","False whiplash claims add an average of £90 to premiums, insurers say .

"No kingpins or so-called 'Mr Bigs' of the drug smuggling ring that supplied the Bali Nine operation have ever been found. Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who will be executed within days for their role in the plot to traffic 8kg of heroin from Indonesia to Australia, are the most senior figures to have ever faced charges over the conspiracy. But key players in the operation - including a Nepalese drug trafficker, a Thai prostitute and a Sydney-based lotto winner - managed to slip through the cracks following the Australian Federal Police sting. Scroll down for video . Less than two weeks after the Bali Nine arrests in 2005, Indonesian police shot Nepalese drug trafficker Man Singh Ghale dead and claimed he was the king pin of the drug ring that supplied the heroin . Following the Bali Nine arrests, Indonesian and Thai authorities let Thai prostitute Cherry Likit Bannakorn – who brought the heroin to Bali and was a key link to the 'Mr Bigs' of the operation – escape arrest . Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who will be executed within days for their role in the plot to traffic 8kg of heroin from Indonesia to Australia, are the most senior figures to have ever faced charges . The AFP had been tracking Chan and Sukumaran  ahead of their April 17 2005 arrests. Investigations to find and prosecute to international smuggling ring behind the Bali Nine plot later established that the heroin came from Myanmar, smuggled via Thailand. But following the Bali Nine arrests, Indonesian and Thai authorities let Thai prostitute Cherry Likit Bannakorn – who brought the heroin to Bali and was a key link to the 'Mr Bigs' of the operation – escape arrest. On April 8, Likit Bannakorn met Chan in a Kuta hotel room and gave him a silver suitcase filled with 'brown packages'. But on April 18, the day after the nine were arrested, Likit Bannakorn slipped out of Indonesia. Chan and Sukumaran - the so-called ringleaders - are moved by police for prison after their verdicts in 2006 . Months after his death the Australian Federal Police admitted Ghale was not the 'king pin' of the Bali Nine ring . Authorities were aware of her alleged role in the Bali Nine operation and she was later arrested by Thai police as she tried to enter at the Thai-Malaysian border. But she was set free and allowed to enter the country, with Thai officials claiming Indonesian investigators did not have adequate extradition documentation for them to detain her. She is still wanted by Interpol. Another figure who will never  explain his role in the Bali Nine operation is Nepalese drug trafficker Man Singh Ghale. On April 27, Indonesian police shot Ghale dead and claimed he was the king pin of the drug ring that supplied heroin to the Bali Nine. Sukumaran looks on during the first day of his trial at Denpasar District Court in 2005 . Chan is lead from a court holding cell for his sentencing trial in 2006 in Denpasar, on the island of Bali . Ghale was at his home in East Jakarta with two young women singing karaoke when Indonesian police entered, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. At the time, authorities said police shot him in his chest because he resisted arrest and tried to escape, labelling him a 'dangerous fugitive'. But the story told by police was contradicted by four witness accounts from neighbours and street vendors who said he was shot in the leg, then was handcuffed and walked to a police car. That was the last time they saw him alive. One drink seller named Hatta said an officer told him the raid was related 'to Bali', while another unidentified witness suggested he was killed because police officers were involved in Ghale's alleged drug crimes, the Herald reported.

Nepalese police said he had a long history of drug smuggling, having set up his base in Indonesia where he supplied heroin from Pakistan and other countries to places like Australia and the U.S. But months after his death the Australian Federal Police admitted Ghale was not the 'king pin' of the Bali Nine smuggling ring. The real mastermind of the trafficking plot is allegedly enjoying an extravagant lifestyle in Sydney, having won $5 million in the lottery after he escaped all convictions. The unnamed drug lord had been the subject of previous police investigations into drug trafficking before the 2005 bust. Chan and Sukumaran have never exposed the identity or the person or people they were working for, fearing they would put their families in Australia in danger. Sukumaran and Chan gesture as they sit inside Kerobokan prison in Denpasar, Bali in 2010 . Chan and Sukumaran were the so-called organisers of the group of nine Australians, supplying them with SIM cards so they could stay in contact in Bali and leading them through the final preparations before they attempted to board their flights to Australia while carrying narcotics. On Thursday, Bali officials signalled the beginning of the end for the pair, with permission granted to move them from Kerobokan jail to their execution place. Momock Bambang Samiarso, head of Bali Provincial Prosecutors, said a meeting on Thursday afternoon confirmed the Bali Nine pair would be transferred to be executed outside of Bali. A meeting on Friday will confirm the date of their transfer. Chan, Sukumaran and their families will be given the required 72 hours notice of their executions.

"Susie Dent turned 50 last year, despite interviews and online biographies suggesting she is 47 . She is the queen of Dictionary Corner, but after more than two decades on words and numbers quiz Countdown it seems Susie Dent still has a problem with maths. The Oxford-educated lexicographer, who reveals the best possible answers for the anagram puzzles, quietly celebrated her 50th birthday last November. But in internet biographies and previous interviews she is stated as being three years younger. Representatives for the mother-of-two said there has never been any attempt to hide her age but that it never seemed important enough to correct if printed somewhere incorrectly. On the Internet Movie Database website, which records everyone who works on a television or film production, her birthday is listed as September 21, 1967, which would make her 47. In an interview in June last year her age was given as 46 – which tallies with the entry on IMDb but is incorrect. However, in a 2005 article written by her former Countdown colleague Carol Vorderman on the joys of being a woman in her 40s, Miss Dent is correctly said to be 41. On the discussion pages of Wikipedia, her age is so hotly contested that it has become a running joke, with users posting comments such as: ‘As an angel, Susie Dent has no date of birth.’ Users seem to have worked out her correct age by piecing together various sources, including obtaining a copy of her birth certificate. It was also confirmed by one of her contemporaries at her £4,200-a-term school, who posted: ‘I was at school at the Marist Convent, Sunninghill, with Susan Dent and she was born in 1964, as I was. She had an older sister called Nicola.’ In an interview in June last year, Susie's (right, with former Countdown personalities Des Lynam and Carol Vorderman) age was given as 46 . Miss Dent (left, with Countdown Nick Hewer and mathematician Rachel Riley) first appeared on Countdown aged 27 and has been on the show for almost 2,500 episodes since 1992 . Miss Dent, who attended private school, was born in Woking, Surrey, in 1964 to Malcolm and Shirley Dent. She now lives in Oxford with her partner Paul Atkins, 42, and daughters Lucy, 15, and Thea, seven. She first appeared on Countdown in 1992, at the age of 27, and has been the show’s resident word expert in almost 2,500 episodes. Her more than 22-year stint has been interrupted only by short breaks because of illness and maternity leave. Her role is to come up with answers for the show’s anagrams. However, it was revealed in 2009 that she is sometimes fed help by producers through an earpiece. Yesterday a representative for Miss Dent said she did not want to comment but added: ‘I imagine she celebrates her birthday every year with her family.’","Susie Dent turned 50 last November - but internet biographies say she is 47 .

"PC Mark Ellis is unlikely to catch many miscreants on his DIY police bike – but at least it raises a smile. The pedalling PC has tarted up his ancient bike using blue flashing lights from an old firearms car and a whirling blue light from an old military police vehicle. He covered the frame in blue and white police-type checkers, and while it has a horn and not a siren, the bike does feature POLICE signs on the front and rear. PC Mark Ellis and his highly customised police bike at the quiet market town of Haverhill's Police Station . The suped-up ride even has a speed gun to catch unwary motorists- which is powered by a battery box at the back. But with only three gears, PC Ellis admits he would have difficulty chasing anyone up hills. While the sight of the officer on his souped-up wheels may fail to strike fear into many, he said the steed brought a smile to people on his beat in the market town of Haverhill in Suffolk. Residents were stunned to see their local police officer cycle past on his DIY police bike with blue flashing lights . PC Ellis said: 'It's not what you call a normal bike. Because it was so old I thought 'let's do something offbeat. 'It's hard work to ride it, it's a bit of an old bone shaker. And because it's only got three gears a slight incline is a killer. 'Trust me to be posted in a town with a steep valley.' The officer was given the bike when he first joined Suffolk Poluce in 1988 but it had been gathering dust until they were reunited last week. The bike features blue flashing lights from an old firearms car and a whirling blue light from an old military police vehicle . The unusual steed also has a blue and white police-type checkered frame,  a horn and POLICE signs on the front and rear .","PC Mark Ellis from Haverhill Police had decided to do up his old pedal bike .

"Two men were hurled from the top of a tower block, two more were crucified in front of a baying crowd and a woman was stoned to death in the latest series of horrific executions by ISIS. The men were thrown from the roof down to the crowd below in the brutal punishment for being gay. Charges found against the accused were announced by a masked Islamic State fighter, using a small handheld radio. Reading from a list, he declares the men are guilty of engaging in homosexual activities and should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State’s radical interpretation of Sharia law. Scroll down for video . Images from ISIS purport to show two men being thrown from a tall building in Nineveh, Syria- their crime was being gay . Pictures show the large crowd gathered at the bottom of the tower to watch the brutal killing . Down on the ground, two men accused of banditry have been tied to makeshift metal crosses. Strung up tightly with yellow and green ribbon around their wrists, the men were hanged from the crosses, wincing in agony’ They had been tied up and transported in the back of a white pickup truck to the public execution sight in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Both prisoners are shown wearing casual clothing rather than the standard orange jumpsuit, commonly worn by many Islamic State prisoners in recent many high profile execution videos. In the series of brutal executions, another two men, who are accused on banditry, are shown being crucified in Raqqa . The image released by ISIS shows a woman accused of adultery being brutally stoned to death . Their blindfolds appear to have partially slipped from their eyes, allowing them to possibly see the surrounding hostile crowd. Two masked IS fighters, dressed in khaki military fatigues are photographed standing behind the two crucified men. Upon drawing their pistols, the fighters shoot the two alleged bandits in cold blood. Their motionless bodies remain tied to the metal crosses to the delight of the all male crowd. It is not the first time Islamic State have released photographic evidence of the horrific execution of homosexuals in Iraq. In December 2014, photos emerged on social media showing a man, accused of being homosexual, being thrown to his death from a rooftop by eight IS fighters. The men had their charges announced by a masked Islamic State fighter, using a small handheld radio, before they were thrown from the roof . A baying crowd had gathered below to witness the shocking execution of the two men . They were executed in front of the crowd after the IS fighter proclaimed them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities and that they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State’s radical interpretation of Sharia law . The horrific punishment was reportedly carried out in the Iraqi province of al-Furat. The victim’s broken body is photographed on the dirty road, lying outside the steps of the orange patterned building. Two other men were also crucified for alleged rape crimes. Their bodies are shown lying tied up to the railings of a nearby fence. Standing nearby is Abu Omar al-Ansari, an elderly Islamic State fighter, with a  thick beard of white facial hair. Al-Ansari rose to fame as a propaganda figure, appearing in a video entitled ‘Message of the Mujahid’, in which he urges other Iraqis to join Islamic State. Al-Ansari, who appears shabbily dressed in a black robe and a pair of combat boots, is shown shown reading out the crimes against a woman, accused of adultery. The woman is dressed in a full black burqa. Back on the ground men accused of banditry hung from the crosses in agony as their wrists were tightly bound with yellow and green ribbon . A masked man reads their charges to the alleged bandits tied who have been tied to makeshift metal crosses . They had been tied up and transported in the back of a white pickup truck (pictured) to the public execution sight in the Iraqi city of Mosul . The final two photos show the burqa clad woman being stoned to death by a horde of Islamic State militants, hurling large rocks at the woman. Lying on the ground surrounded by a pile of rocks, her bright red socks are still visible. An old piece of blue tarpaulin was then used to cover the dead woman’s body as the militants disperse from the horrific scene. It appears the stoning was not carried out at the public execution site like the city’s main square. Instead, she appears to have been stoned in a quieter residential area, away from the baying crowd.

"He’s the new man about town and eight-year-old Dunlop is making quite a splash with the ladies. The stocky sea lion has puckered up for a whiskery kiss with just one of his girlfriends at the Sea Life centre in Mooloolaba, on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Sitting back on his flippers, Dunlop holds his head high and closes his eyes as his latest lady friend reaches to give him a wet peck. Scroll down for video . Dunlop (right) the sea lion receives a Valentine's kiss at the Sea Life centre in Mooloolaba, on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland . Dunlop only arrived in Mooloolaba in December but the charismatic mammal is already fitting in well. Along with 18-year-old female Katanya, Dunlop was brought to the Sea Life centre as part of its breeding and marine protection program. Sea Life Mooloolaba Mammals Manager, Mark Ryan, said while the two are yet to officially seal the deal, all signs are pointing towards breeding success. ‘Dunlop is taking a liking to some of the females we have here at SEA LIFE Mooloolaba and he certainly has his pick of the bunch, so we are confident these signs of affection will result in breeding,’ Mr Ryan said. Meanwhile, 18-year-old female Katanya poses for a photo at the side of the pool . Katanya and Dunlop were brought to the Sea Life centre as part of its breeding and marine protection program . Dunlop reportedly has more than one girlfriend at the seal life sanctuary where breeders hope he will become a father . ‘Not many people realise that Australian Sea Lions are an endangered species, with less than 15,000 left in the wild, so it is important that we work together to further educate the public on seals, while enhancing conservation efforts and breeding programs. ‘It will be a major step towards understanding and protecting the species, while continuing the attraction’s conservation mission to educate the public about these animals.’ The centre recently launched an interactive ‘Seal Discovery’ experience, where visitors can experience the sounds, smell and sight of the creatures – including a pod where you can learn to talk like a seal.

"Winter Storm Linus dropped as many as 20 inches of snow in the Midwest last week closing down roads, schools, and even public transportation. Photographer Seph Lawless decided to take a snow day with his camera and visited the now abandoned Rolling Acres Mall in Akron, Ohio to photograph it once again. When Lawless arrived at the mall last week he was pleasantly surprised to discover the dark and dingy shell of a shopping center had been transformed into a winter wonderland. Scroll down for video . Winter wonderland: The blizzard turned the abandoned Ohio mall Rolling Acres into a living snow globe with rolling mounds of snow on the escalators once filled with shoppers . Before the snow: Photographer Seph Lawless took photographs of the abandoned mall last year for a book and his perception of the dark and dingy mall transformed into something magical this time around . Snowone here: The abandoned mall, which when it was operating was decorated with fake snow around the holidays, is brighter with snow and reminded the photographer of the mall in its heyday . DailyMail.com spoke to Photographer Seph Lawless back in April of 2104 about his book Black Friday: The Collapse of the American Mall which featured pictures of the once booming shopping center after it was abandoned in 2008. Remembering that the mall skylights were broken during his last visit, Lawless decided to venture out to see just how much snow got through to the interior. 'I went because I knew that the skylights were a little compromised last time I was there, but I never anticipated that they were in such bad shape to the point that that much snow got into the mall,' Lawless told The Huffington Post. Lawless, who told DailyMail.com last last year that he once worked at the mall and he would visit often as a child, said that the snow reminded him of fake snow, holiday decorations, and of the mall in its heyday. Skylight: Seph Lawless decided to re-visit the mall after the storm because he remembered that the skylights were broken during his last visit and he knew some snow would get inside . Ghost town: The mall has no shoppers on the escalators but with all the snow one might want to take a sled and dive down the ramp . Bright: The abandoned mall is dark and falling apart but the snow allows for the light to reflect and recreates some of the mall's  former brightness . 'I think that's maybe what makes it so magical in a sense, it's like you're walking into a snow globe,' he told the Huffington Post. 'For me it wasn't so dark and creepy this time around. It was kind of magical.' When Lawless was photographing the mall in 2012 and 2013 his goal was not to show the mall's magical side but to represent the economic decline of America and especially Ohio. 'The goal was to show the world a different side of America. A vulnerable side. I think an abandoned mall is symbolic of the economic decline of America and is a true indication of what happens when cities like Cleveland suffers massive population loss due to loss of manufacturing jobs,' he told DailyMail.com. Ice cave: The Rolling Acres mall has been transformed into a snowy wonderland after heavy snowfall . Snowlight: Even though the mall is in a closed space, the snow leaked in through the skylights . Dark: The mall photographed by Lawless a few years ago was much darker without snow even with rays of light inching through the skylight . 'Cleveland has lost nearly half its population since these malls opened in the mid-1970,' Lawless added. 'We're not talking white flight here. People fled the state to find jobs and the problem hasn't gotten any better. 'My city is not only losing jobs. We’re losing people and it's frightening. During my recent art curation at the City Club I spent most of that time urging Cleveland residents and city officials to adopt a plan to merge East Cleveland with Cleveland so we can maintain our population, because doing nothing is no longer an option.' Lawless returned to the malls, which were closed in 2008 and 2009, to document them before demolition crews move in and flatten the buildings later this year. He explained that when North Randall mall was built it was the largest in the world, with 5,000 employees. 'It was such an intricate part of the city that the town is represented by the two shopping bags appearing in the municipal seal,' he said. Empty: Though people no longer shop in the mall one could build snowmen to fill the space after the storm covered the abandoned shopping center . Snow Globe: Seph Lawless likened the abandoned mall to a real life snow globe . Crumbling: This photograph taken of the abandoned mall without snow for Seph Lawless' book is far less enchanting than the photos of the mall covered in snow . 'I chose to focus on malls for this book because I think a mall is a human connector. We all can relate to a mall in a very personal way. We all remember spending time there and for the most part it was in happier times,' Lawless said. 'I remember visiting Santa Claus as a kid at these malls during Christmas and eventually getting my first job at the mall. The mall had character and the architecture was beautiful.' The once gleaming walkways and modern designs look outdated and grimy in his images, and it is hard to imagine the buildings filled with families and friends enjoying a day out. But when Lawless returned, his memories helped bring the malls back to life. 'Strangely enough as I explored these abandoned malls I found myself acting like a kid all over again. At times jumping up on to nearby fountain ledges trying to balance myself as I became mesmerized all over again by the futuristic skylights that dangled fearlessly over my head. 'It was enough beauty to make your chest feel like it was going to cave in...All over again.' The self-declared 'artivist', who combines activism through works of art, promotes his work on inequality and injustice through his Facebook and on his Instagram and Twitter accounts. He said his work often is seen as controversial but that it leads to 'constructive dialogue and healthy debate'. Spot of hope: The snow breathes new life into the abandoned and dark Rolling Acres Mall . Once busting: The mall once held thousands of people and now is an abandoned snowy terrain . Empty and poor: When Lawless was photographing the mall in 2012 and 2013 his goal was not to show the mall's magical side but to represent the economic decline of America and especially Ohio .","Winter Storm Linus dropped as many as 20 inches of snow in the Midwest last week closing down roads, schools, and even public transportation .

"The United States Coast Guard is sending one of the largest ships in its fleet to rescue an Australian fishing boat that is trapped in Antarctic ice. The Coast Guard dispatched icebreaker Cutter Polar Star to the Antarctic Chieftain's location approximately 900 miles northeast of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. The 399-foot Polar Star, which has 150 crew members and its home port in Seattle, Washington, was given the exact coordinates by Rescue Coordination Center New Zealand last night. Scroll down for video . Cutter Polar Star (pictured) was sent to the rescue by Rescue Coordination Center New Zealand last night . The 399-foot Polar Star is one of the most powerful non-nuclear ships in the world. It will battle 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall and break through miles of ice to rescue the Antarctic Chieftain . Antarctic Chieftain (pictured) called for help after it suffered damage to three of its four propeller blades . The 207-foot fishing vessel called for help after it suffered damage to three of its four propeller blades. The Chieftain has lost its ability to maneuver and is completely stuck in the ice. There are 27 crew members aboard the trapped vessel. US Coast Guard Vice Adm. Charles Ray said: 'The seas of Antarctica are treacherous and unforgiving. 'This incident is a sobering reminder of the importance of the US icebreaker fleet as we see increased human activity in the polar regions.' The Polar Star will open a channel through several miles of nine-foot thick (above) ice to reach its destination . The heavy icebreaker had just completed Operation Deep Freeze when it was sent to rescue the Chieftain . Polar Star Capt. Matthew Walker said he is 'confident' in his ship's ability to reach the Antarctic Chieftain . The  cutter will travel more than 330 miles to reach the Chieftain and is scheduled to reach the boat at approximately 10pm tonight. To get there on time, the Polar Star will have to battle 35 mph winds, heavy snowfall and break through multiple miles of nine-foot thick ice. Once the boat is free, a fishing vessel from New Zealand and will escort the Chieftain to the nearest safe harbor. Capt. Matthew Walker, the Polar Star's commanding officer, said: 'The considerable geographic distances and extreme environmental conditions make this a complex rescue mission. 'However, we're confident in our ability to reach the Antarctic Chieftain and committed to ensuring the safety of life at sea no matter the challenges.' The heavy icebreaker had just finished its annual mission, Operation Deep Freeze, to break a channel through the sea ice of McMurdo Sound to resupply and refuel the US Antarctic Program's station on Ross Island. Commissioned in 1976, the Polar Star is one of the largest ships the Coast Guard has and one of the most powerful non-nuclear vessels in the world, according to the Coast Guard's website.

"The parents of a teenager who claimed that she has no rights as an American citizen because her parents never legally registered her, have hit back. Alecia Pennington, 19, who was born in Texas, claimed that because she was born at home, she has no birth certificate. She also said that she was taught at home by her mother so has no school records along with no medical records or a social security number. Her mother, Lisa Pennington, posted a Facebook message on Thursday, which said that although the family would have preferred to handle their issues privately, the level of attention led them to produce a video response to their daughter. Scroll down for videos . Mr Pennington (pictured left) responded to his 19-year-old daughter Alecia's claims that she has no proof that she is an American citizen by saying in a YouTube clip that he would help her obtain necessary documents . Mrs Pennington wrote: 'We want to say loud and clear that we love our daughter and want her to have everything she wants in life. 'We have offered many times to help her and have continued to offer since the video came out. We have never refused to help. We had no idea what she had been through trying to obtain this information until the video came out. She never told us about any of it. She added: 'We wish her every happiness.' Her father, Mr Pennington echoed these remarks and addressed his daughter directly in a video clip. He also appeared to confirm that his daughter had no birth certificate or other official documentation by his remarks. He told Alecia, in a video posted to YouTube, that family wanted 'to help her move on with her life in any way they can'. The father, who has eight other children, said that he saw on Facebook that Alecia was trying to get her driver's license  but didn't realize 'because you were out trying to do that on your own'. Alecia Pennington, 19, posted this image on Facebook where she claims that her lack of legal documents means that she cannot prove she is an American . He said that he had helped her older brother and sister get their driving licenses and it was something he could also do for her. 'I understand that someone in the family is preparing an affidavit for us to sign and we would be happy to do that,' he continued. Mr Pennington said that in order to show she was a permanent legal resident, Alecia would have to obtain a birth certificate or a passport, adding that the latter might be easier. The father, who is an accountant and an attorney, added: 'Your older siblings have had some similar challenges and I've helped them through all of that.' 'I was home-schooled my entire life, so I had no school records,' Pennington explained. 'Also, never been to the hospital, so I have no medical records. This leaves me with nothing to prove my identity or citizenship.' Should this be true, she would be a victim of identification abuse. It appeared that Alecia, who is one of nine children, left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side. Alecia is one of nine children (above with their father), and left her home last September, with the help of her grandparents on her mother's side . Alecia's mother Lisa (left with Alecia and her three sisters) claimed that her daughter is misleading people . Her mother, a popular blogger in the home-schooling community, had earlier posted on her blog,The Pennington Point, that what her daughter was saying was untrue but removed the post. Mrs. Pennington also posted a video in response to Alecia's video on YouTube, but later took that down as well. Alecia does have older siblings, and it is unclear if they have licenses or any form of identification, though her mother, and now her father, has claimed that they do. Mrs Pennington also claimed that her daughter does have a birth certificate to the best of her knowledge. It is also worth noting that after Alecia released this video and started a Help Me Prove It Facebook and Twitter page, her father bought the domain name, making it impossible for her to use.","Alecia Pennington, 19, said she has no official records because her parents never obtained her birth certificate and she was home-schooled .

"Boris Johnson has dropped in on Washington's Smithsonian Air institute during his six-day jaunt to the U.S., but not before taking a swipe at George Osborne and suggesting Americans still wish they were ruled by the Queen. The London mayor yesterday called on the Chancellor to hand massive financial powers to cities to help 'detoxify' British politics. He further claimed that Westminster was going through a 'very rocky period' and devolution would help to 'electrify' the political scene. Later that day, after catching a train from New York to Washington, he visited the Smithsonian Air institute where he was pictured gazing at exhibits ranging from early Boeing models to the Apollo  space missions.

He also took time to visit an exhibit showcasing the moon landings - including this lunar landing mural . Mr Johnson with The Spirit of St Louis, which made the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris in 1927 . The Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall also captivated the mayor during his six-day jaunt to the U.S. Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, Mr Johnson insisted the Treasury had 'nothing to fear' from reforms - and insisted such a move would have had the support of Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson said: 'To get it done you simply have to get the Treasury to understand that they make more money out of this. 'They have nothing to fear. Even a Labour mayor couldn't possibly make a hash of this. Winston Churchill would have got it done.' Mr Johnson said devolving fiscal powers would give cities a mandate to push growth policies instead of having to go 'begging for penny packets of funding'. The move would be fiscally neutral so would be a 'no lose' move for the Treasury, the mayor insisted. He added: 'When you look at the state of politics in Britain there is no question that it is going through a very rocky period. Politicians are not thought generally to be in touch with people, there's a lack of communication, people don't feel the politicians are answering their needs. Devolution is obviously the way forward.' Boris Johnson and New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton  view a presentation about surveillance .

He will today return to New York for talks with his counterpart in the city as he completes his U.S. trade mission. Bill de Blasio pulled out of a meeting with the London mayor earlier this week citing ill health, despite attending an event at New York University the same evening. The left-wing New York mayor is expected to be well enough after recovering from a cold to discuss ways of boosting links between the two cities at the rescheduled talks this evening. After arriving back in city, Mr Johnson will head straight to the 9/11 memorial then tour the New York Fire Department. Meanwhile Mr Johnson has used his six-day, £25,000 jaunt to the US to present himself as an international statesman. But he has got some way to go to raise his profile stateside, after revealing he was stopped in the street by a New Yorker who thought he was another tousled- haired blond: American tycoon Donald Trump. The London Mayor is trying to woo investors to the UK capital, but risked raising hackles with a claim that Americans secretly wish they were still ruled by the Queen of England. London Mayor Boris Johnson obviously still has some way to go to raise his profile stateside, after being stopped by someone who thought he was another tousled haired blond: Donald Trump . Mr Johnson has defended his globetrotting against claims he is a 'part-time mayor', arguing he is boosting business back home in London. He started in Boston at the beginning of the week and has been in New York meeting fashionistas including Alexa Chung. Appearing on LBC radio from the Big Apple, he was questioned by a New Yorker about his infamous mop of unruly blond hair. He insisted he has it styled that way, before revealing how it meant it was mistaken for Mr Trump during his visit. 'It's better than the other question I was asked by… I was walking down the street and then somebody was taking my photograph and a young woman stopped and she said, 'Is that Trump?' So! I think she meant, 'Is that Donald Trump?' At 68, Mr Trump is almost two decades older than the 50-year-old London Mayor, who joked he was more famous and wealthier than the businessman, thought to be worth $4billion. Mr Johnson is using a six-day, £25,000 jaunt to the U.S. to present himself as an international statesman . There was a sense that Americans are not taking Mr Johnson entirely seriously yesterday when his political ambitions were mocked by U.S. presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton today. Mrs Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is expected to be the Democratic nomination for president in 2018, asked whether U.S.-born Mr Johnson had turned his sights to the White House. She said: 'Is he announcing for president? Which one do you think he'll be, Democrat or Republican?' The jibe comes followed criticism of Mr Johnson's 'promotional tour' of the United States, amid claims he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader. The U.S. jaunt is his third long-haul mission in the last three months, having already visited Iraq and Far East. Mr Johnson has faced criticism for his 'promotional tour' of the United States, amid claims he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader . Taking questions from Americans on the radio, Mr Johnson was repeatedly asked about his dealings with the Queen, from the names of her Corgis to what they chat about. He joked that America's fascination with the Queen is a mark of a secret desire to be reunited with Britain in a 'commonwealth of English-speaking peoples', reversing the declaration of independence from the British empire made in 1776. Three out of four questions to the mayor from Americans on his LBC radio phone-in related to the Royal Family, with Mr Johnson asked when he last spoke to the Queen, what kind of sandwiches were eaten at Buckingham Palace, and what Her Majesty's pet corgis were called. Mr Johnson said: 'What does this show you? That deep down, in a primal way, they regret the fundamental schism of 1776 and they wish that we were in a single commonwealth of English-speaking peoples again united under Her Majesty. That's what they secretly want.' He added: 'What do they want? Royalty. They have been deprived of it too long, that blissful pride that goes with a hereditary monarchy.' He was grilled about his dealings with the Queen, but was unable to say when he last spoke to the Queen, what kind of sandwiches were eaten at Buckingham Palace, and what Her Majesty's pet corgis were called . However, Mr Johnson proved incapable of answering any of the requests for information about the royals. On the sandwiches served in the Palace, he joked: 'I don't know. Ham from Bucking?' And on the corgis' names, he said: 'I haven't got the faintest idea what they are called. Basil? Eric?' Mr Johnson revealed that he had not spoken to the Queen since shortly after the 2012 Olympics, when she asked about her cameo appearance alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig, which ended with a lookalike parachuting into the stadium. 'She very innocently wanted to know whether people thought it was funny and I said it was brilliant,' said Mr Johnson. Asked whether he had really not spoken to the Queen since then, he replied: 'I don't get to see the Queen that often. What do you think I do? Spend my whole time round Buckingham Palace sucking up to the monarchy?'","London mayor has visited the Smithsonian Air institute in Washington .

"Spring flowers are blooming early as a result of the mild, less wet winter. The National Trust's annual Valentine's flower count found a 11 per cent increase on last year. Gardeners and volunteers recorded blooms at National Trust properties across the South West, where spring tends to arrive earliest. Scroll down for video . Blooming: Spring flowers, such as snowdrops, are in bloom earlier this year as a result of the mild winter. The National Trust's annual flower count found an increase of 11 per cent on last year . They counted 1,345 flowers at 18 gardens in Devon and Cornwall, compared with 1,205 in 2014 – but still far below the record of 3,335 in 2008. Camellias have been in bloom in Cornwall since November and the warm weather last week has boosted snowdrops and aconites, the Trust said. But a cold snap appears to have slowed the earliest spring some gardeners had seen. The gardens of Lanhydrock near Bodmin, Cornwall, have the most flowers in bloom. Head gardener Tommy Teagle said: 'It promises to be a colourful spring providing the weather is good.' Popular: Daffodils were voted the nation's second favourite spring flower, with snowdrops in first place . Ian Wright, National Trust gardens adviser in the South West, said: 'Comparing the number of plants across our gardens on a set day each year gives us a real insight into how our gardens respond to weather patterns, and is a useful barometer for the season ahead. 'You can almost map the progress of spring as it travels from west to east, south to north by way of the flowers in our gardens. 'I would thoroughly recommend getting out there and reaffirming your senses with ""all things nature"". 'I always marvel at how uplifted you can feel after spotting your first swathe of daffodils or magnolias in flower against a crisp, blue sky.' The National Trust asked supporters to vote for their favourite spring flower. Snowdrops came first, ahead of daffodils and primroses. Tommy Teagle, head gardener at Lanhydrock, said: 'We've had 146 plants in flowers this year, over 100 of the plants are camellias and the daphne is smelling superb. 'Overall there is a plethora of buds on the plants and it promises to be a colourful spring providing the weather is good.' Across the whole of the South West, 1,622 plants were recorded in this year's count, compared with 1,454 in 2014. The gardens of Lanhydrock near Bodmin, Cornwall, have the most flowers in bloom. But the cold snap appears to have slowed down the earliest spring the head gardener at Glendurgan, near Falmouth, had ever seen, leading to the biggest drop in the number of blooms of any of the gardens compared with last year, from 98 down to 73.","Spring flowers are bursting to life early thanks to mild winter weather .

"The vintage slogan 'Do you love anyone enough to give them your last Rolo?' has been voted the most romantic ad of all time. Manufacturer Nestle axed the slogan in 2003 saying it was too sentimental, but its popularity has lingered long enough for ad buffs to vote it their favourite. John Lewis just missed the top spot with its Christmas 2012 ad about a snowman on a mission to find the perfect present featuring the tagline 'Give a little more love this Christmas.' Scroll down for video . My last rolo: The classic advert which featured a cartoon woman giving her last chocolate to a man she was in love with was voted the most romantic of all time . Google's 2009  ad took third place with its story told through search terms such as 'impress a French girl', 'long-distance relationship advice', 'churches in Paris' and 'how to assemble a crib'. Marketing editor Rachel Barnes said: 'Rolo's slogan is so ingrained in the public psyche that you could ask someone on the street today and they would find it just as current as it was in the 1990s. 'It works so well as it rings true - it's hard to give away your last bit of chocolate, but you'll do anything for the special person in your life. John Lewis's 2012 snowman campaign beaten into second, but expert says it does not have 'staying power' of some of the classic campaigns such as Milk Tray man . She added: 'John Lewis' ad tells a tale of classic romance, but I'm not convinced this one goes down in history among the most romantic ads of all time. 'The retailer's high share of the vote is no doubt because all their advertising is just so brilliant right now. In 10 years' time, I don't think people will recall the snowman in the same way they fondly remember ""your last Rolo"".'","John Lewis's ad featuring snowman looking for perfect gift come second .

"A Tory MP has announced her engagement to a BBC presenter - after just two months together. Charlotte Leslie, 36, is set to marry BBC Radio Bristol host John Darvall, who she began dating in October last year. The twice-divorced father-of-four, who is in his 50s, popped the question on Christmas Day and the Bristol North West MP described the moment as 'just completely natural and lovely'. She said: 'We have known each other since 2011, when he started interviewing me. BBC Radio Bristol host John Darvall, a twice-divorced father-of-four, popped the question on Christmas Day . 'He's always given me quite a tough time, as he's a robust interviewer. 'I always enjoyed it because there was always a lot of banter. 'I like the fact that we don't agree and if I ever get too Tory-Tory, he'll bash me. 'He'll dissect my arguments, and I enjoy being challenged.' Leslie, who was once voted the seventh sexiest woman in politics, added: 'My parents always said you could tell we got on well on air. He came for tea and that was it.' Charlotte Leslie, 36, once voted the seventh sexiest woman in politics, said he had always given her a tough time as Mr Drvall is a robust interviewer . The pair first met outside work after discovering they had both lived in the same home as children. Mr Darvall, who has interviewed her several times since she won her seat in 2010 hosts BBC Radio Bristol's current affairs show. Despite Darvall's passion for political debate, now that he's fallen for an MP he won't be able to present his show during the election period owing to the conflict of interests. From next month he will be moving from the mid-morning slot to present the station's Afternoon Show until after the General Election. A BBC Bristol spokesperson said: 'We have every confidence in the professionalism and impartiality of all our presenters and staff but given the heightened sensitivities of an election period, this arrangement is to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest.'","Charlotte Leslie, 36, is set to marry BBC Radio Bristol host John Darvall .

"Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with the boy - a former student - when he was just 14 years old and living at their home in Washington state . Former students of a Seattle area teacher charged with rape showed up at a King County courtroom in Kent Thursday to offer their support as she entered a plea of not guilty to a charge of child rape. Students, some alongside their parents, carried signs that said 'We stand by you' and said they don't believe the allegations against Darcy Smith as they packed a Kent, Washington courtroom Thursday. The 41-year-old Renton woman is accused of having sex with a student she took into her home as a troubled 12-year-old. He said they started having sex two years later, sometimes while Smith's husband and children were in the other room. He reported the incidents last year and is now 19. Many of the students on hand in court Thursday told KIRO that Darcy was like a mother to them. And one mother who was there to support Smith--who was once named a regional teacher of the year--can see why. Kim Vea had four children in Smith's classes. She said they even called her ""auntie."" 'She was the finest I've ever met and she shouldn't be in this situation and I know she's innocent,' Kim Vea, whose children call Smith 'Auntie,' told KIRO. Smith was put on leave in August when the district learned of the investigation. The alleged victim first reported the allegations to the King County Sheriff’s Office last May. Smith has been on administrative leave since August, when her employer, the Highline School District, was informed of the boy’s claims. He told detectives that he and Smith started having sex when he was in the 8th grade and the relationship continued until he moved out of her home at 18. Showing support: Students and parents piled into a Washington courtroom Thursday to show support for Smith, who's charged with having sex with a 14-year-old boy . There were so many people showing support in the courtroom that some had to sit in an overflow area . The boy had moved in with Smith and her family when he was 12 years old and a pupil in her 6th grade class, reports Seattle PI. The unusual arrangement had the blessing of the boy’s mother who didn’t speak English and though Smith would be a good influence on her son whose brother was in a gang. The boy told detective that Smith first showered him with gifts and affection before agreeing to care for him full time, according to charging papers. But the victim said things would change in the evenings when the kids and Smith's husband went to bed, and she drank wine. According to the documents, the victim said Smith made him promise not to tell anyone or 'she would go to jail and be in big trouble if he told.' The McMicken Heights sixth-grade teacher is free without bail until her next court appearance March 12. Smith pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a child rape charge stemming from incidents the victim claims spanned years .

"THE FISH LADDER . by Katharine Norbury . (Bloomsbury £16.99) When Katharine Norbury was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer in her mid-40s, she told the radiographer: ‘I have a ten‑year-old daughter. I have to live.’ Katharine Norbury tells of her emotional journey to reconnect with her family (picture posed by model) The doctor asked if there was a history of breast cancer in her family, but Norbury didn’t know. She was adopted. Attempts to trace her biological mother had failed and her father was merely a dash on a birth certificate. Though she was raised by wonderful adoptive parents, she had always felt ‘dizzyingly adrift’. This uncertainty about her own origins drives her to seek out more tangible sources: those of rivers around the British Isles. In this crisp, poetic little book, Norbury describes her walks beside rivers, including the Thames, Mersey and Severn. She first began these walks to ward off the depression she felt looming after a late miscarriage, not many months before the cancer diagnosis. She had suffered from mental illness before. While working as a successful TV script editor, she had awoken from an unexplained blackout to find herself coughing blood down a sink, while her husband (novelist Rupert Thomson) sobbed in the shower beside her, with his head in his hands. She had a feeling she had been screaming, but no memory of what or why. Another time she made herself a cup of tea and walked to her bedroom window. As she pulled the curtains, she found five other cups lined up along the sill, each in various stages of cooling. Norbury knew she could not go back into that dark place. She had to stay sane and strong for daughter Evie, who had longed for a brother. So she began to walk. Evie keeps her mother company on some of these adventures, but Norbury’s most extraordinary journeys are taken alone. A scary man is spotted hurling rocks into the sea. She is too afraid of him to pass, and so makes the bizarre decision to curl up and sleep in the sand dunes until he has gone. When she awakes, he is there and she retreats to her car, only to find somebody has let her tyres down. Although her birth mother has made no effort to contact her, Norbury finds her living near the source of the River Severn. She walks past this woman’s house and fantasises about a reunion of flowers and chocolates. She imagines receiving a letter confessing: ‘I love you. There has not been one day when I have not thought of you.’ Instead she receives a cold rebuff: a nasty note explaining she was the result of a ‘quickie’ at a party in Australia and had been delivered under general anaesthetic so that her mother never even saw her and wants to hear no more about the ‘horrible’ matter. The rejection makes it easier for Norbury to ignore her wishes and she traces her half (or possibly full) brothers, Robert and Ioan, in Wales. Online she finds a rugby team photograph and in it a ‘smiling man, who had my daughter’s eyes’. They go along to a match and Norbury realises how much an uncle might mean to little Evie. A few days after the match, Evie is holding a bundle: ‘Soft and fluffy, and smelling of milk and fabric softener.’ Her baby cousin. As mother and daughter drive home, they pass the village where Norbury’s birth mother lives. They don’t stop. Coming out of the slick, wet darkness of a storm, they count seven rainbows in the sky ahead.","Katharine Norbury was diagnosed with breast cancer in her mid-40s .

A four-year-old boy had his leg amputated after he was severely injured in an attack by his father's police dog. Hunter Mastaler, as named in local reports, had his left leg amputated a few inches below the knee following damage to the arteries and veins, and will receive a prosthetic leg. The attack occurred at the family's home in Hesperia, California last Sunday afternoon involving police take-home K9 Jango - the dog handled for two years by the child's father, Michael Mastaler, an officer for the Rialto Police Department. Neighbors said they heard the boy screaming when the attack happened on February 8 around 4.30pm. Mr Mastaler had been away for two days when he returned home and let six-year-old Jango out of his kennel, and into the backyard before going upstairs, according to the Victorville Daily Press. While he was in the shower, Hunter, who was left watching TV and playing games, wandered into the backyard after somehow making his way through the sliding glass door, and was attacked by the Belgian Malinois. The boy's mother had been out running errands and he was looking for her when he made his way outside, according to Police Captain Randy DeAnda. When neighbors heard screaming coming from the Mastalers' backyard, one broke through the wooden fence and another pulled Hunter from the dog's mouth. Shannon Houlemard, whose husband Jeff, broke down the fence said they ran over after her sons heard screaming from down the road. Four-year-old Hunter Mastaler (above), as named in local reports, had his left leg amputated a few inches below the knee following damage to the arteries and veins, and will receive a prosthetic leg. When neighbors heard screaming coming from the Mastalers' backyard, one broke through the wooden fence and another pulled Hunter from the dog's mouth. One neighbor said he kicked the dog but it would not let go so he had to pull the animal's mouth open . She said: 'There was a neighbor over there first who was just trying to hit the dog over the fence with a pole or something, but my husband knocked the fence over, and another kid who is a freshman in high school actually pulled (the boy) from the dog's mouth.' During Mr Houlemard's attempts to break down the fence he said he gave it his all. 'I hit (the fence) with all I had, fell and busted my shoulder, but I ran right through it,' he said. 'I kicked the dog, but it still didn't let him go, so I whipped him around and pulled the (dog's) mouth open. '(A neighborhood teen) pulled the boy out of the dog's mouth. (The boy's leg) was already facing the wrong direction. The attack was probably going on for at least two minutes before he was pulled out. It was so traumatic.' Anthony, 14, who pulled Hunter from Jango's mouth said he was not scared, according to CBS Los Angeles. He said: 'It was more of his life, you know, he’s a little boy. He has more to live.' Anthony (above), 14, who pulled Hunter from Jango's mouth said he was not scared during the rescue attempt . Jango will not be returning to the family's home (pictured above) and has been placed with Hesperia Animal Control in a ten-day quarantine . After neighbors banged on windows and rang the doorbell to alert Mr Mastaler, he eventually came out and got Jango under control before placing him in his cage. As they waited for the ambulance to arrive at the scene, the Houlemards waited with Hunter, sang the alphabet and counted to keep him alert. Mr Houlemard said he did not believe the incident happened as a result of negligence. '(Mastaler) was hitting himself in the head, (saying), 'What the hell?' Like he had no idea how it happened,' he said. 'He was beating himself up over it and I was just telling him to help his son, and talk to him.' The young boy was airlifted to Loma Linda University Medical Center where he has received treatment since last Sunday. The results following the police department's investigation will determine the the dog's fate . According to Police Captain Randy DeAnda, he said that the department thinks the bite was 'accidental' and that it was a very 'tragic accident' A GoFundMe page, which has named Hunter and the Mastaler family, has said that Hunter's recovery will continue even once he leaves hospital.

"Plans to shoot scenes for the new James Bond film in a graveyard in Rome have been blocked, by a mysterious and ancient religious order. Daniel Craig is filming his fourth 007 movie Spectre in Italy, including a scene in which Bond attends a funeral. But the Archconfraternity of the Departed, a religious order which historically provided burial for the poor and destitute, and which still has sway over the cemetery, has refused entry to cast and crew. Daniel Craig (pictured filming his fourth 007 movie Spectre in Austria) had been due to shoot a funeral scene in in Italy . The graveyard, built on the site of a Roman necropolis, has been a place of burial for some twenty centuries. The order of brothers are thought to have blocked the arrival of the elaborate film set so as to ‘respect the sanctity’ of the tombs, according to Rome-based newspaper Il Messaggero. ‘They won’t want an invasion of trucks and heavy goods vehicles inside the cemetery,’ it said. The production team are scrambling to rework the scene so it can take place in the piazza outside the Museum of Roman Civilisation, in the fascist-era district of EUR, built by Mussolini. Plans to shoot the funeral scene Cemetery of Verano (pictured) in Rome but were prevented by the Arciconfraternita dei Trapassati religious order . On Wednesday the office of Mayor Ignazio Marino received a request ‘to film part of the footage previously expected to be filmed at the Cemetery of Verano, at the space in front of the Museum of Roman Civilisation following technical problems that have arisen with the Arciconfraternita dei Trapassati.’ The veto is the only the latest setback faced by the Bond team. Officials also blocked filming at the intersection of four 16th century fountains, where Bond was due to take part in a high-speed pursuit, because they were too fragile and too close to Italy’s presidential palace. And in December, nine cars customised for filming scenes in the Alps were reported stolen from a garage before they were due to be shipped to the set. Action-packed: The filming of the latest James Bond fim Spectre has taken the cast and crew (pictured here in Austria) across the world . Licence to kill: Clearly 007 isn't going easy on his foes in this scene which the production team say is a major action scene . An early version of the script was stolen during the cyber-attack on Sony Pictures, prompting fears that it would be published before the film’s release. But the filmmakers did manage to postpone proposed new legislation which would have required expensive testing on all guns used on film sets. Rooted in tradition that goes back to the fourth century and later in the order of the ‘Brothers of the Good Death’ the Arch-confraternity’s mission until the 20th century was to provide assistance to the sick and ensure a proper burial to all even if they could not afford it. Since the 1960s it has been in a slow decline. Location: They were filming in the snowy mountains of Sölden, Austria as well as Obertilliach and Lake Altaussee .

"Family doctors are being told to prescribe a more active sex life to patients who need to get more exercise. New guidelines say GPs should also recommend dancing and mowing the lawn as part of a drive to routinely prescribe activities. Patients could then be called or texted by their doctor afterwards to make sure they are sticking to the advice, says the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. Scroll down for video . Family doctors are being told to prescribe a more active sex life to patients who need to get more exercise . The body says exercise is an often overlooked ‘miracle cure’ that can work far better than many drugs and could save the NHS billions a year by significantly reducing the risk of breast cancer, dementia, heart disease and even hip fractures. But campaigners said it was no business of GPs to pry into the sex lives of their patients and warned that the advice risked causing offence. The College stated that regular activity of all kinds reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 per cent, dementia by 30 per cent, heart disease by 40 per cent and hip fractures by 50 per cent. Yet latest figures show that more than half of Britons, 56 per cent, fail to achieve the NHS’s recommended minimum amount of exercise of 30 minutes, five times a week. And a Government-commissioned report last year warned that our average activity levels were the worst in the Western world and directly responsible for one in six deaths. Lead author Scarlett McNally, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Eastbourne District General Hospital in Sussex, said even small amounts of exercise could make a ‘huge difference’. She said that for some illnesses, exercise was just as effective as drugs including for depression where it was often prescribed instead of Prozac. ‘It could be as simple as taking the stairs rather than a lift, kicking a ball about with your children or grandchildren.’ She added. ‘We’ve got to change what we think of as normal, because what we are seeing in our hospitals and surgeries up and down the country is that normal has become not enough exercise.’ ‘Too many of my patients are paying the price for that with broken bones and years of ill-health that could have been avoided by being more active.’ The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges said regular activity of all kinds reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 per cent, dementia by 30 per cent, heart disease by 40 per cent and hip fractures by 50 per cent . Although GPs are already urged to prescribe exercise for obese patients, the latest guidelines go further by routinely telling all patients to be more active. The College, which represents 220,000 doctors, suggests patients are started off gently with daily brisk walks, using the stairs, dog-walking or having more sex. Its guidance states: ‘Many activities can be promoted; brisk walking, cycling, climbing stairs, dog-walking, using outdoor gyms and dancing – even sexual activity can bring some benefits.’ Professor Dame Sue Bailey, chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: ‘This is about people and their doctors believing that the small effort involved is worth it because they are worth it. 'There really is a miracle cure staring us in the face, one which too many patients and doctors have quite simply forgotten about.’ But Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s none of GPs’ business to be talking about patients’ sex lives. I would take amiss at that and I’m sure many others would too. ‘This is particularly true as nowadays most patients don’t even know their family doctor.’","Exercise is an often overlooked 'miracle cure', says healthcare body .

"An Arizona photographer saw her photo of breastfeeding women yanked from Facebook after a chorus of male detractors reported them as obscene. Jade Beall, who's been photographing the female form for 15 years, says she posted her shot of seven nude women with their nipples and genitals blurred. 'I received many private messages (all from men) telling me I should remove the photo,' she told Cosmo. When someone, likely one of these men, realized she'd missed blurring one nipple, the photo was taken down. Outrage: An Arizona photographer was shocked when her photo of women nursing their children was yanked from Facebook despite her having blurred the NSFW parts . Tucson-based Jade Beall says mostly men on Facebook asked her to take the photo down . Beall's been taking breastfeeding photos like the one Facebook banned ever since she documented her own post-pregnancy form. 'It was a nude self-portrait I took of myself breastfeeding my son (when I was 80 pounds heavier), that sparked my desire to photograph and celebrate the beauty, 'flaws', shapes, and vulnerabilities of all mothers,' she told Cosmo. This new phase in her work gave birth to a book 'A Beautiful Body Project' published last year. In it, Beall placed unretouched photos of 'women alongside their stories of their journeys to build self-esteem in a world that thrives off women feeling insecure.' It's no surprise, then, that she was less then ecstatic over some of the negative responses to her Facebook photo. Do I think it's silly that men can have exposed nipples but women cannot as a rule for this platform? Sure, she says. 'But what I would love most is for Americans to redefine their relationship to a woman's breasts and to praise and celebrate the nude, varying body shapes without having to label them disgusting or unhealthy.' The photographer has touched so many that her book was funded entirely by donors and volunteers, who hraised tens of thousands via Kickstarter for the cause. 'It was a nude self-portrait I took of myself breastfeeding my son (when I was 80 pounds heavier), that sparked my desire to photograph and celebrate the beauty, 'flaws', shapes, and vulnerabilities of all mothers,' Beall told Cosmo . Ms Beall told the Huffington Post: 'We are facing an epidemic of women who feel unworthy of being called beautiful.' To rectify this 'epidemic', she hopes to redefine society's idea of beautiful women, especially those whose bodies have transformed through pregnancy and childbirth. 'Shaming mothers for not ""bouncing back"" after childbirth can cause feelings of failure when being a mother is challenging enough,' she explained. Ms Beall added that negative feelings are often exaggerated among the many women who feel 'un-beautiful' even before giving birth.","Jade Beall snapped a group of nude mothers breastfeeding and says she got tons of messages from annoyed men despite blurring the nipples .

"Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson fired an amazing 10 birdies in succession to claim a third straight win in the 40th Ryder Cup, but it was Europe's only success as the United States fought back on Saturday. After two victories on the opening day, Rose and Stenson were sent out first in the morning fourballs by captain Paul McGinley and responded with a stunning display of golf to beat Bubba Watson and Matt Kuchar 3&2. The home pair were 12 under par for 16 holes and their American opponents nine under in defeat in a record-setting contest as the players revelled in the calmer conditions at Gleneagles.

However, Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan then combined to beat Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson 4&3 and rookie pair Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed thrashed Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer 5&3 to reduce the gap. And it took some belated heroics from Ryder Cup talisman Ian Poulter to ensure he and Rory McIlroy claimed half a point against Jimmy Walker and Rickie Fowler to keep the home side in front by 6 1/2 to 5 1/2. Poulter holed a pitch from short of the 15th green for birdie to avoid going two down and also birdied the par-five 16th, but by that stage had already been left out of the afternoon foursomes. 'Late delivery, second class post,' said Poulter, a reference to his nickname of 'The Postman' because he always delivers a point in the biennial contest.

There was plenty to celebrate for Justin Rose on Saturday morning. He's on course to become the first European player to win five points in one Ryder Cup . With Stenson sitting out the foursomes to rest a niggling back problem, McGinley sent Donaldson and Westwood out for the third session running to face Zach Johnson and Kuchar, with Kaymer joining an inspired Rose in the second match against Spieth and Reed. McIlroy and Sergio Garcia had been due out second but their match against Furyk and Mahan was moved down the order to allow McIlroy time to rest, with the final match between Victor Dubuisson and Graeme McDowell and Walker and Fowler delayed by 15 minutes. That meant Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley sat out the entire day, while Stephen Gallacher also missed out after a fourball defeat with Poulter on Friday. Back issue or not, Stenson started his and Rose's recovery from two down after six with a birdie on the seventh and Rose birdied the next to get the home pair back on level terms. The Scottish crowds were out in force at Gleneagles to watch the European and USA players do battle at the 40th Ryder Cup . It was a thumbs up from Ian Poulter as he and Rory McIlroy staged a stirring comeback to halve their match with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker . But it was a rough morning in more ways than one for Thomas Bjorn. The Dane and Martin Kaymer were on the end of a thrashing from Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed . Both players birdied the par-five ninth and Rose birdied the 10th and 11th as well, although that was only good enough to stay level in a match of the highest quality. Stenson's birdie on the 12th took Europe ahead for the first time - Rose was also within five feet of the hole - and another Rose birdie on the next put them two ahead. Stenson maintained that advantage by matching Watson's birdie on the 14th and the Swede looked to have struck a decisive blow when his approach to the next left a tap-in, only for Kuchar to hole from 30 feet across the green for a half. However, Rose produced another superb pitch to three feet on the par-five 16th to seal a remarkable win. 'It might be a highlight to put on the big screen with the grandkids one day,' Stenson admitted. 'I was lucky enough to be there and back Justin up on a couple of occasions.'

"A morbidly obese woman was told by doctors that she risked being permanently paralyzed as a result of her weight, just weeks after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. Susan Farmer, 37, who is the latest subject of TLC's obesity series My 600lb Life and weighed more than 607lbs when she was at her heaviest, underwent the procedure at the recommendation of a specialist, however soon after lost all feeling in her legs. 'I've been doing anything to get better and this doesn't feel fair at all,' Susan, who was forced to lose more than 100lbs before being able to undergo the procedure, said. 'But I will not end up in a wheelchair.' Scroll down for video . Morbidly obese: Susan Farmer, 37, was told by doctors that she risked being permanently paralyzed as a result of her weight, just weeks after undergoing gastric bypass surgery . Drastic measures: Susan weighed more than 607lbs when she was at her heaviest, and had gastric bypass surgery on the advice of a specialist . Fear: Susan, who was forced to lose more than 100lbs before being able to undergo the procedure, was determined not to end up in a wheelchair . Susan was diagnosed with a nerve condition known as neuropathy, which often affects people who are overweight or obese, leaving them with severely damaged nerves. The condition must be treated immediately after diagnosis, otherwise the sufferers are at risk of permanent paralysis. 'A specialist saw Susan and she has been diagnosed with a condition called neuropathy,' obesity specialist Dr Nowzaradan explains. 'This condition is nerve damage that can be the result of being obese for a long time. Susan is losing weight but she is still going to suffer from the effects of being so heavy for so long. 'It can be permanent so we need to treat it immediately and make sure she doesn't lose any muscle.' Prior to her surgery, doctors warned Susan that she was at serious risk of severe illness, injury - and even death - as a result of her obesity. She explained that life had become completely 'miserable', and that she was unable to look at herself in the mirror because she hated her own reflection so much. Damaged nerves: Susan was diagnosed with a nerve condition known as neuropathy, which often affects people who are overweight or obese . Urgent care: Neuropathy can be permanent so Susan’s doctors needed to treat her immediately to make sure she didn’t lose any muscle . Risk: Prior to her surgery, doctors warned Susan that she was at serious risk of severe illness, injury - and even death - as a result of her obesity . Under anaesthetic: Susan pictured during surgery in the operating theater . 'Life is miserable,' she explained. 'I hurt all the time so I don't get up much. With me having this big stomach, it falls on me so bad and it feels like my skin is on fire. 'I have trouble breathing, especially when I'm walking. I have to take baby steps, because I am afraid of falling. And if I fell, there is nothing anybody could ever do for me. 'I don't like looking at myself, so I don't look at myself in the mirror. To me, I am fat and ugly. All I see is a fat glob. I'm just disgusted about the way I look.' Susan's mother Nita admits that her daughter first began putting on weight at an early age, after turning to food as a form of comfort in reaction to her parents' unstable relationship. 'When Susan was about four or five, me and her dad started fighting a lot,' she explained. 'He was an alcoholic, he would come home drunk, and somebody was going to get hit. It was either me or Susan.' 'I would just eat,' Susan added. 'I don't know if I was eating to make me feel better. I just ate because the food was there.' Recovery: Susan went into rehab after the surgery to get stronger both physically and mentally . On the mend: Susan had been at risk of her paralysis becoming permanent . Emotional: Susan first began putting on weight at an early age, after turning to food as a form of comfort in reaction to her parents' unstable relationship . Depressed: Susan said life had become completely 'miserable', and that she was unable to look at herself in the mirror because she hated her own reflection so much . Despite her mother's belief that her daughter would grow out of her over-eating, Susan continued to indulge, turning to food whenever she came up against a problem in her life - a dangerous habit which left her severely overweight and at serious risk of a variety of health issues. And while Susan began to see some progress in the short weeks following her gastric bypass surgery, she admitted that being diagnosed with a condition which meant she was unable to move around left her feeling unable to make any further progress. But after putting on some of the weight which she had lost following her surgery - prompting a serious lecture from her doctor - Susan finally finds the motivation that she needs to continue her weight loss journey. 'I've been thinking about being in a wheelchair, and using that as motivation to keep going,' she says, shortly after being submitted into a rehabilitation facility, where she had to learn how to walk all over again. 'The surgery was my second chance at life. And I'm not going to let a setback like this take that from me. I'm going to fight. I'm going to do everything I possibly can to get better. 'Even though I'm back at square one, I am not giving up. If I lose my ability to walk I'm going to end up gaining everything back. Bad habits: Susan first began comfort eating at the age of four, when her parents began fighting . Number one supporter: Susan's mother Nita is there to help her with every step of her weight loss journey . Success! At her final weigh-in, Susan is told that she has lost an impressive 267lbs in 12 months . Then and now: Prior to her surgery, Susan weighed more than 607lbs (L), however she manages to get her weight down to an impressive 340lbs a year after her first visit to the doctor (R) 'And then I'll just be waiting to die. It's my life that's at stake.' More than a year after her first visit to Dr Nowzaradan's office, Susan returns for her final weigh-in, which reveals that she has managed to lose a staggering 267lbs in total, leaving her weighing 340lbs. 'I can't believe it,' she told the cameras shortly after stepping off the scales. 'I'm very proud of the progress that I've made so far. A year ago I was barely walking. Right now, my world has changed. And I'm starting to get my life back. 'This year has been the most difficult year of my life. BUt everything I've gone through in losing this weight has been worth it. 'I will never go back to the way I was. I've come too far. I'm enjoying life and I'm happier than I've been in a long time. It feels so good to have a reason to smile again.'","Susan Farmer, 37, ballooned to 607lbs following her parents' divorce when she was just 17 .

"If you’re bored of hard-boiled eggs having a yellow centre and a white exterior, then you’ll want to pay attention to this wacky recipe for inside out eggs. A Japanese chef revealed a method to reverse the colour of your eggs in a YouTube video. Using a few bits of equipment found around your home - including a pair of tights and a torch - you too can enjoy the novelty of a boiled egg that has its white albumen on the inside, and its yellow yolk on the outside. Scroll down for video . We're not yolking: A Japanese chef has revealed how to turn an egg inside out (image of final egg shown). In a bizarre video he shows how spinning it can reverse the colour. First, you need to tape up the egg, and then spin it in a pair of tights. Then, by boiling the egg, the yolk should appear on the outside . In the video Yama Chaahan explains how to perform this piece of cooking trickery by spinning the egg and then boiling it. What you'll need: An egg, clear tape, a torch, a pair of tights and ice cubes. 1. Check the colour of your egg with a torch . 2. Put tape around the whole shell of the egg . 3. Wrap it in the middle a pair of tights . 4. Spin it round for a few minutes by holding either end of the tights . 5. Check on the colour again. It should be darker than in step one . 6. Take the egg out of the tights and place it in boiling water with the tape still on . 7. Once boiled, remove the egg and place it in a bowl of ice for a minute . 8. Now peel the shell, and you should now have an inside out egg. If the whole thing is yellow, try it again but spin it for longer. The science behind it is that the yolk of the egg is more dense than the albumen. When you spin the egg rapidly, the runny yolk is drawn towards the edge of the egg via the centrifugal force, while the albumen is pushed to the centre. If you spin the egg for long enough, the yolk and albumen separate, so that when boiled the egg appears inside out. If you don’t spin it for long enough, the two mix so that you get an instant scrambled egg. To get started, you’ll need a pair of tights, some clear tape, a torch, ice cubes and, of course, an egg. First, hold the torch up to the egg to check on its colour. The egg should glow. This will be important for later. Now, get your tape and completely encapsulate the egg, ensuring that the shell will remain strong and in one piece for the next few steps. Next, lay out your pair of tights, and wrap your egg in the middle of them. Twist it up at either end so it is secure; you may want to use small ties or bits of string to keep it in place. This graphic shows the step my step process to get your perfect inside out egg . The reason the egg appears inside out is that the yolk is denser, so the centrifugal force moves it to the outside of the albumen when the egg is spun. This can make a change from regular eggs with their white albumen on the outside and yolk on the inside (stock image shown) Once done you’ll want to hold either end of the tights and spin the egg around for a few minutes. Using your torch, you need to check on the colour of the egg - when it looks much darker than it did at the start, you’re ready to get cooking. Remove the egg from the tights but keep it wrapped in tape, and place it in boiling water. Leave it in there for a few minutes until it is boiled, then take the egg out and put it in a bowl of ice for a few minutes. Now, peel back the tape and the shell, and you should find that the first thing you’ll see is a yellow egg, rather than a white one. Cutting open the egg should then reveal the white albumen at the middle, surrounded by the yolk on the outside. If you find that the whole egg is yellow, rather than just the outer layer, this is because it hasn’t been spun long enough. If you try it again, keep spinning the egg for a few minutes when it is wrapped in the tights. You should now have a method to amaze dinner guests with a culinary delight - or play a practical joke on others.","A Japanese chef has revealed how to cook an egg inside out .

"British aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious could continue its life as a disaster relief ship - despite getting a radical makeover as a luxury yacht. Bold plans have reimagined the 31-year-old vessel, which leaves Royal Navy service later this year, as the 'Commonwealth Yacht' with three modern 'sails' containing bedrooms, restaurants and conference suites towering above deck. Yet below deck the 23,000-tonne vessel could still contain a hospital, heavy-duty trucks and equipment to help in a global disaster, designers claim. Bold: The design for HMS Illustrious, Britain's last current serving aircraft carrier, features three 'sails' with restaurants and conference centres above deck - but a hospital and disaster relief supplies below it . Flight of fancy? The 'dual use' idea has been put forward to the MoD, though it is unclear how it would be funded . Iconic: HMS Illustrious, pictured returning to Portsmouth from the Philippines on Friday, is the last of three aircraft carriers to be replaced by the Royal Navy. Unlike its sister ships, it could avoid the scrap yard . The ship, which returned from an aid mission to the typhoon-hit Philippines on Friday, will be the last of the Navy's three Invincible class light aircraft carriers to be decommissioned later this year. The controversial decision will leave Britain without a single aircraft carrier until two new £6 billion vessels enter service in 2020. Unlike HMS Invincible and the Ark Royal, which ended up in Turkish scrapyards, the Ministry of Defence said it wanted to find a new use for HMS Illustrious and invited firms to bid for it. The Commonwealth Yacht plan is one of the first to be made public and was the brainchild of two yacht design firms from Britain and Austria. The futuristic drawings replace planes on the flight deck with swimming pools and instead of militaristic control towers would be the modern 'sails'. Futuristic: Two yacht design firms from Britain and Austria say the ship could retain its ski-jump take-off ramp . Blue sky thinking: The aircraft carrier's militaristic control tower would be replaced with 'sails' which look more at home on a cruise ship, alongside swimming pools where jets once resided on the flight deck . Illustrious: The ship was one of three light aircraft carriers in the Invincible series and the last to leave service . Yet the ship could still be used actively as an aircraft carrier with its ski-jump take-off ramp remaining intact - providing a curious experience for those having a quiet swim. Its designers, Portsmouth-based BMT Nigel Gee and the Viennese firm Sigmund Yacht Design, say it would be used to promote trade in the Commonwealth and host conferences. Then if a global disaster happened it would spring into action, using its resources below deck. Exact details of the plan, including how much it would cost, have not been announced publicly. An organisation willing to fund and run the hybrid design - such as a charity or the United Nations - would also have to be persuaded to take it on and possibly tweak the design to their own purposes. No organisation has yet agreed to do so, it is believed. Sigmund Yacht Design owner Peter Symonds said: 'We are hoping to convince the MoD that this carrier has a life after the Royal Navy. Crucial role: The ship returned to Portsmouth harbour on Friday from relief efforts in the Philippines . Vast: Pictured arriving on Friday, the ship weighs about 23,000 tonnes and is 636ft long, carrying 650 crew . When the ship is axed, Britain will be without an aircraft carrier until two vessels enter service in 2020 . Stormy times ahead: The crew of HMS Illustrious salute as she arrives into Portsmouth Harbour on Friday . Pride: The ship's five-month aid mission to the Philippines will have been one of its last for the Navy . Return: Sailors disembarked on Friday having not seen their partners, parents and children for five months . 'She may be 30 years old but we believe there is a role in the world for her yet. We thought she would be fantastic as a luxury yacht, but also there is the idea to have her as a Commonwealth aid ship. 'She has just come back from the Philippines, so maybe we can convince a charity or the United Nations to invest in her to perform that role as well. 'There is a lot of talk about what she could be used for, but no-one has put pen to paper to actually show what she could look like and how it might work. 'We believe our design is a brave interpretation of such a distinguished vessel, stating boldly its new purpose, while paying respect to its impressive heritage.' James Roy, yacht design director at BMT Nigel Gee, added: 'In recognising the importance of preserving such an iconic vessel, we came up with the idea of a ""Commonwealth Yacht"", where Illustrious could serve all nations of the Commonwealth as a vehicle for promoting trade, attending international events, and undertaking humanitarian and disaster relief work around the globe.' Known to her crew as Lusty, the ship is the fifth Royal Navy warship and second aircraft carrier to bear the name Illustrious. Reunited: Kayleigh Dawson kisses her boyfriend Sam Moysey, one of those who served on the Philippines mission . Joyous: Petty Officer Andrew Boote with his three-year-old son Max Boote at Portsmouth Harbour . Emotional: Thousands of friends and relatives witnessed one of the ship's last returns to Portsmouth . Welcome: The band of the Royal Marines playing on Friday. The Invincible class of aircraft carriers will be replaced with two £6 billion vessels, which are due to enter service in 2020 . Entering service just after the Falklands War in 1982, she helped to maintain the no-fly zone over Bosnia during the war there in the early 1990s. She was deployed to operate the no-fly zone in Iraq during Operation Southern Watch in 1998, and led the naval task force to Sierra Leone during that country's civil war in 2000. Various refits later, the Government decided during the defence cuts in 2010 that Illustrious would be retired from service in 2014. Other bids for the ship, which had to be finalised last month, exist from the cities of Portsmouth and Hull to retain her as a heritage attraction. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'All interested parties needed to complete an industry day application form and return it to the Disposal Services Authority (DSA) by December 10. 'For commercial reasons we cannot discuss individual applications received by the DSA. 'A number of applications have been received and these are being assessed.'","Vessel saw service in Bosnia, Iraq, Sierra Leone and the Philippines .

"They've been branded 'high class prozzies', 'call girls' and 'pathetic sex workers’. But what really makes an intelligent young woman, who has had every chance in life, use a sugar daddy dating service to meet an older man. One who did sign up to a sugar daddy website is Emily, 22, from Hampshire, an advertising student studying at a university in the north of England. The SeekingArrangement website where Emily met her sugar daddy . Far from being ashamed of her activities, Emily, who is using a false name but has provided real pictures, says people shouldn't be so quick to judge. 'A site like this just felt more honest,' she explains. 'It asks you about your desired arrangement and obviously you don’t get to ask things that you would on a regular site. ‘I get to say that that I want someone successful and powerful and who I find attractive and while that might sound arrogant on a normal site, in reality, it’s what most women want’. It took a few months of exchanging messages with different men online until Emily met someone that she wanted to meet up with in person. The man she would eventually strike up a relationship with was a multi-millionaire but, at 44, he was also twice her age. Emily refers to her interactions with this man as ‘an arrangement,’ and she freely admits that despite dating him for six months, she was never in love with him. During this time, her ‘sugar daddy’ gave her weekly cash payments and showered her with designer presents. 'I got a weekly amount but mainly it was gifts and shopping and things that we would do and buy together,' she explains. 'He bought me Jimmy Choos, Dior shoes, dresses and jewellery - he kitted me out. He gave me everything down to workout clothes, an iPod, a new phone, speakers for my room, bed sheets, trainers and everything. It was nice. ‘I have always been someone who likes going to nice places, wearing nice clothes and shoes and bags - having access to all of that is very much my cup of tea.’ Emily is reluctant to reveal how much the weekly cash amount was, but admits that it totalled roughly £5,000 over the six month period. On top of her clothes and weekly payments, he splashed out £1,500 on a fancy party for Emily’s 21st birthday. 'He paid for me to have a £1,500 birthday party with cocktail and cakes and champagne,' she explains. ‘I have never been treated like that before and I couldn’t get my head around the fact that he didn’t even want to be there. ‘He didn’t ask for me to do something in return, he just cared for me and wanted for me to have a nice birthday party.’ Although the pros in Emily’s arrangement are clear, she admits that a lot is also required of her in order to be given these financial rewards. ‘Discretion is expected of me, because these guys do understand that there is a bit of a taboo around doing this. ‘I am also expected to look good, if I turned up in baggy jeans they’d ask what I was doing. Also, you should not infringe too much on their time, although often I feel like they are the more clingy ones. Seeking Arrangement is a dating site that links rich older men with young beautiful women. It was founded by US businessman Brandon Wade (pictured with his wife Tanya . ‘I met a guy once and we were in his Porsche and he took a call from Lamborghini and I couldn’t really say to him, ""Can you not do that?"" ‘You are basically trying to be a bit more on your best behaviour.’ Emily claims that she didn’t sleep with her ‘sugar daddy’ during the six months that they were together, because she wasn’t ready. But she does admit that they went further than any platonic friends ever would. 'He wanted more but I wasn’t ready,’ she explains. When asked if they kissed and how ask far they did go, she replied: 'Yes, we kissed. It was like we were in the early stages of a relationship.’ Although Emily clearly enjoys the finer things in life, she says that the money is just one part of dating an older, rich man. 'I usually fancy men who are slightly older than me,' she explains. ‘With guys in my year, it’s a different kind of attraction - guys at university are hot, but if you try and have a conversation with them, it’s different. ‘Men have a different offering - intellect, wisdom and awareness of themselves and of me. ‘Also, it has opened my eyes to what is happening in this country - I had no idea of all the things that were on offer. ‘I guess it blurs the class lines - people think we’re worlds apart from millionaires but nothing could be further from the truth.’ Emily eventually broke up with her sugar daddy after the strain of being in a long distance relationship became too much and is now back on the site looking for another arrangement. And while she freely admits that she is charging for her company, she is adamant that her behaviour is nothing like prostitution. ‘These are guys just looking for relationships, I have never referred to anyone as a sugar daddy and God forbid should I be called a sugar baby. ‘But you have to put a label on something - these men saying ""I’ve got all of this money but I don’t know where to meet these girls"". They don’t move in circles where they would fall into these situations, so it’s just a platform. 'Anyway, some people would argue that a relationship and an arrangement are interchangeable. It is the link with prostitution that has been formed that is the problem. ‘One has more beauty, one has more money and it’s just a platform for people with different offerings, whereas prostitution is a service or a product, something to be bought. ‘People are always going to make trade-offs in relationships and we’ve all got different things to offer. ‘People are always going to be getting the most for what they can, that’s just society’.","Emily Jones, 22, from Hampshire, is member of a sugar daddy dating site .

"Newsagents  questioned by police over the sale of copies of Charlie Hebdo say they believe officers were given clear orders to seek customers' details. Forces across Britain have repeatedly denied ever instructing officers to make such inquiries, instead claiming their visits to stores were to ease community tensions. After a handful  in Wiltshire and Wales came forward to say they had faced such questions, police repeated their protestations. But shop owners and readers of the magazine have today slammed their reaction, saying they have been left 'outraged' by having their claims dismissed. Newsagents have expressed fury after police denied claims they instructed officers to demand the names of Charlie Hebdo readers. In one case a force categorically rejected the claim such questions had been asked . Among them is Deborah Merrett, a newsagent in Powys who said she was 'angered and upset' police had rejected her account of the story. 'I think the police officers were told to come and ask, I think it was their mission,' she told MailOnline today. 'The way that they have denied it and claimed that they wanted to know about the sales for our own protection is rubbish. 'I haven't seen any police around here at all since. I was working on my own at the time with a shop full of people when they came in. 'They asked me who I sold the copies to and do they live in the area but as soon as they did I told them I would not be disclosing customers' names. 'I've since had customers coming in and begging me not to tell anyone they'd bought the magazine. 'The whole thing has angered the community and left me and my husband upset.' The satirical magazine produced a special edition for its first issue after the attack. Millions of extra copies were printed, with enthusiasts queuing outside shops in London (above) and Paris to purchase one . One customer who bought the magazine said she did not see the difference in police requesting her details and those of people who bought Je Suis Charlie badges or marched in support of the victims of the Paris massacre last month (above) This morning a spokesman for Dyfed-Powys maintained its denial that such questions were asked, saying: 'We can confirm no purchaser details were asked for or recorded.' In Pontypridd, another newsagent was allegedly contacted by a PCSO over the phone and asked to share the name of a customer who pre-ordered the magazine's special edition. He refused, instead sharing the conversation with the reader, David Jones, the following day. When contacted by MailOnline this morning, Mr Jones said: 'I didn't think too much of it at first but when I read about the one in Wiltshire I thought something was very strange. 'They'd said the PCSO was overzealous and had acted on her own and I thought ""well that's rubbish."" 'When I went to collect my copy, the newsagent told me straight away about how he had been phoned the night before and asked the same questions. 'He didn't give my name so I didn't complain but now it's being said the case in Wiltshire was down to the officer, that's just clearly not the case.' Sir Peter Fahy, national police lead for preventing extremism, said officers who demanded the names of people who bought Charlie Hebdo in the wake of the Paris attacks appeared 'overzealous and unneccessary' South Wales Police's Prevent team said no directive had ever been given to question newsagents or demand the names of customers who had bought the magazine but was investigating the gentleman's claims. His comments were in reference to a PCSO in Wiltshire who, it was said yesterday, acted independently when she asked a store for the names of customers who purchased the publication. Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police and the national head for preventing extremism, said the staff member involved had been 'overzealous'. 'I understand why asking for the names of those who might have bought this magazine will appear over-zealous and unnecessary. 'There was no national guidance to this effect and it is not to be supported unless there is clear evidence that a crime has been committed.' A customer of the newsagent denied the claim, telling MailOnline today: ‘I certainly wasn't under the impression the officer had gone in there of her own accord. 'I don’t think she did and she has been absolutely hung out to dry.' Anne Keat, a pensioner who said she bought the magazine to support freedom of speech added: 'If they’re going to ask for my name for buying the magazine they should be getting the names of all the people who bought Je Suis Charlie badges and turned out to march in Paris. 'I don't see the difference between them.' Freedom of speech campaigners slammed the police's position in the row as 'unacceptable'. 'This move by the police is entirely unacceptable. This sort of investigation would be understandable if a crime was being committed, but the fact is that they have requested information about people who have purchased a perfectly legal publication,' Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch said. 'It is far from clear why the police thought it was acceptable to request this information or what it is that they actually intend to do with it. 'Considering the comments made in the aftermath of the attacks in Paris by world leaders, that free speech should be celebrated and encouraged, the moves by the police in the UK completely undermine that.' Last month 11 members of staff at the French magazine's officers were killed by Islamic Extremists, sparking global outcry and support of freedom of speech. Millions of issues of its 'survivor issue' were produced, with queues forming outside newsagents selling the magazine across Europe.","Newsagents slammed police denial that they asked for readers' names .

"Little Mayzee Jo Gaspa's shocking injuries after being attacked by the Staffordshire bull terrier in Archway, North London . These are the shocking injuries suffered by a toddler after she was mauled by her neighbour's Staffordshire bull terrier. Mayzee Jo Gaspa needed 240 stitches and surgery after being set upon by the  beast at her  home in Archway, North London. The child's mother Maria Dew told how the animal dragged the 18-month-old 'round like a rag doll' after pouncing. 'Looking at her after it let her go, I thought she was going to die,' the 34-year-old said, told the Daily Mirror. The Staffordshire bull terrier had been brought into little Mayzee Jo's home by a neighbour, who was talking to her mother. Ms Dew recalled her daughter's 'horrendous' screams during the attack, which took place five months ago. The panic-stricken mother battered the animal in the mouth in order to get it to release little Mayzee Jo, according to the newspaper. Police and paramedics were called to reports of a child being bitten by a dog just after 6pm on Saturday, September 6 last year. 'Officers attended and the child was taken to an east London hospital,' said a police spokesman. Mayzee Jo's mother reportedly said she underwent emergency surgery after being airlifted to hospital from the scene. She almost lost her nose in the ordeal and still requires further treatment to repair the damage, according to the Daily Mirror. Ms Drew and Mayzee Jo's father, Michael, have decided to release the shocking images to caution other parents about the dangers of these dogs. Five months after the dog attackattack Mayzee Jo, pictured with her father Michael and mother Maria Dew, needs further surgery . The Staffordshire bull terrier's owner Gemma Neil admitted having a dog dangerously out of control at Highbury Corner Magistrates Court on October 29 last year. The 28-year-old is due to be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court on February 27. No decision is believed to have been made about the fate of the dog that is being kept in kennels, according to the Daily Mirror. Mayzee Jo's mother said that she was dragged 'round like a rag doll' during the ordeal and needed 240 stitches . The Dangerous Dogs Act applies to all dog owners in the UK regardless of their breed or size. Under the Act, it’s illegal for a dog to be ‘out of control’ or to bite or attack someone. The legislation also makes it an offence if a person is worried or afraid that a dog may bite them . Those convicted of the offence where a person has been injured can face up to five years in prison. The RSPCA say if anyone is concerned about the behaviour of their pet then they should consult a behaviourist.","Mayzee Jo Gaspa attacked by neighbour's Staffordshire bull terrier .

"The BBC’s coverage of the bombing of Dresden in which Britain was described as ‘worse than the Third Reich’ was condemned as disgraceful by RAF veterans and MPs last night. Despite dedicating more than 32 minutes of airtime to the 70th anniversary of the fire-bombing that killed tens of thousands at the end of the Second World War, there was barely a mention of British airmen who lost their lives. The BBC’s four major news shows and Radio 4 interviewed multiple German survivors of the bombings. They showed Victor Gregg a British prisoner of war who berated those who ordered the raids, adding it was ‘demonic’ and ‘evil’. The BBC’s coverage of the bombing of Dresden (aftermath pictured) in which Britain was described as ‘worse than the Third Reich’ was condemned as disgraceful by RAF veterans and MPs last night . But the coverage failed to mention the 55,000 airmen who died for Britain during the war. Nor did it mention the devastating Nazi bombing raids on London and Coventry. One presenter even referred to Dresden as a ‘war crime’ and another spoke of how Britain ‘deliberately unleashed devastation on civilians’, while failing to refer to Auschwitz or Hitler. During the only interview – which lasted just 23 seconds – with an RAF crewman who flew on the raid, the 91-year-old was asked: ‘Did you ever feel guilty about what happened at Dresden?’ Former Lancaster bomber rear gunner Harry Irons DFC simply replied: ‘No, not really.’ Last night politicians, historians and military figures said the coverage was a ‘disgrace’ and disrespectful to the airmen who served and died in Bomber Command. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, told the Daily Mail: ‘It is very unfortunate that the BBC chose on all days to produce such a one-sided account. ‘It was just as one might expect from the BBC, concentrating on the negatives. ‘What about the civilians in London who were bombed out of their homes? What about the bombing in the Blitz? To suggest that those responsible for the bombing of Dresden were on a par with Hitler or guilty of war crimes is an absolute disgrace.’ Despite dedicating more than 32 minutes of airtime to the 70th anniversary of the fire-bombing (aftermanth pictured) that killed tens of thousands, the BBC barely mentioned British airmen killed . The BBC coverage of the Dresden bombings (aftermath pictured) failed to mention the 55,000 airmen who died for Britain during the war . Most of the BBC coverage focused on an interview with Victor Gregg, 95, who was a British prisoner of war in Dresden during the bombing. He said: ‘I saw people killed every day... but what I saw in Dresden – I’ve never seen women and children involved before.’ Asked by the presenter if he thought it was a war crime, he said: ‘Definitely.’ Mike Brundle, who served in the RAF for over 25 years, said: ‘The BBC should have had someone who was a member of Bomber Command on that operation – those are the ones who risked their lives. A total of 125,000 men served as Bomber Command aircrew during the Second World War. Their chance of surviving the war was lower than that of infantry officers in First World War trenches. Bomber Command had a 44 per cent death rate – 55,573 died in action. The average age of crewmen was 22 but the youngest were only 18. A total of 9,838 members of Bomber Command became prisoners of war. Of the 365,514 sorties flown by bomber crews, 297,663 were at night. Some 3,249 Lancasters were lost in action – nine during the bombing of Dresden. Almost three quarters of Bomber Command dead were British – the rest were from Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Victoria Crosses were awarded to 19 members of Bomber Command. ‘If the war had gone on for another year, how many millions more would have been killed at Auschwitz? ‘By all means cover it but the one-sided BBC coverage has incensed me. He (Victor Gregg) said we were worse than the Nazis.' A woman who wrote a letter to the Daily Mail added: ‘The BBC is beyond belief. Do we hear you “celebrating” the “hell” that was Swansea burning, or Coventry, or Plymouth, or Portsmouth – with the same unctuous sympathy as you are showing for Dresden? We have nothing to be guilty about.’ Military historians and former military top brass defended the bombing of Dresden. Historian Frederick Taylor told the Mail: ‘Thousands of innocent civilians as well as soldiers were dying every day as battles raged in east and west – not forgetting the concentration camp inmates who were still being murdered by starvation, violence, disease, and forced marches. ‘How could any resource – including the massive Allied air forces – be left unused in trying to shorten the war and save many, many thousands more innocent lives? There should have been more room for another view.’ Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, added: ‘It was an entirely understandable target. The bomber crews carried out the duty they were equipped to do with bravery and efficiency. I would have liked to see (the BBC) talking about the lessons of the war and a mention of Bomber Command.’ A BBC spokesman said: ‘The bombing of Dresden has always been a controversial episode. On Thursday evening the main BBC News bulletins reflected this and featured interviews with British veterans in coverage of preparations for the commemoration. On Friday we covered the commemoration ceremony in Dresden, which understandably reflected on the German experience.’ A BBC spokesperson added: 'BBC News has covered in greater depth than any other broadcaster many aspects of the commemoration of World War II - both the human cost on all sides and the military action - and will continue to do so.' The BBC’s coverage of Dresden began on Thursday night: . BBC News at Ten, 10.24-10.28pm . Report dominated by disturbing images of German casualties and a graphic interview with prisoner of war Victor Gregg, 96, who talks of bodies ‘exploding’. A whole minute is devoted to survivors Anita John and Nora Lang, who describe seeing ‘the dead everywhere’ and thinking it was ‘the end of the world’. Only 23 seconds are given to RAF veteran Harry Irons, 91, who is asked: ‘Did you ever feel guilty after the war about what had happened at Dresden?’ He replies: ‘No, not really. I think because we were very young and we lost so many boys ourselves.’ The reporter says the campaign showed how the allies ‘deliberately unleashed devastation on civilians’. BBC Breakfast, 6.07-6.10am yesterday . Focuses on German survivor Ursula Elsner, who says: ‘We clung to a lamppost but one woman didn’t make it … she was sucked into the burning ruins.’ No one from Bomber Command or UK military is featured. The only alternative view is from Dresden Military Museum’s Gorch Pieken, saying: ‘It is just an example of warfare and of course it makes sense … Dresden was part of the enemy and you have to hit the enemy to end the Second World War.’ The BBC dedicated 32 minutes of coverage to the Dresden bombings (aftermath pictured) - of which just 23 seconds was spent on an interview with an RAF veteran . BBC Breakfast, 7.40-7.48am . Focuses on German victims, with no mention of Britons who died.

"Newly elected Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in the state Friday, calling the current system of capital punishment 'error prone, expensive and anything but infallible.' Wolf said the suspension will remain in effect at least until he receives a report from a legislative commission that has been studying the topic for about four years. 'If we are to continue to administer the death penalty, we just take further steps to ensure that defendants have appropriate counsel at every stage of their prosecution, that the sentence is applied fairly and proportionally, and that we eliminate the risk of executing an innocent,' Wolf said in a memorandum announcing the policy. Newly minted Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf  imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in his state Friday, 13, calling the current system of capital punishment 'error-prone, expensive and anything but infallible' Wolf said he is granting a temporary reprieve to Terrence Williams, scheduled for execution March 4 for killing two men. Williams was convicted of first-degree murder after beating to death in 1984 a man at a cemetery with a tire iron. For that killing he was sentenced to death. He was separately convinced of third-degree murder for stabbing to death a Philadelphia man earlier that year at the age of 17. He admitted to killing them both while in his teens but now says the men had been sexually abusing him. Pennsylvania's death row, which has been shrinking, houses 183 men and three women, but the state has executed only three people since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976. All three had voluntarily given up their appeals. The most recent execution was Gary Heidnik in 1999, convicted of killing two women he had imprisoned in his Philadelphia home. The governor pointed out on Friday that six people on death row in his state had been exonerated since 1978 and that 150 people nationwide haves since been proven innocent. Wolf said data suggests that defendants might be more likely to be charged with capital murder and sentenced to death if they are poor or a racial minority and the victim is white. 'If the commonwealth of Pennsylvania is going to take the irrevocable step of executing a human being, its capital sentencing system must be infallible,' Wolf wrote. 'Pennsylvania's system is riddled with flaws, making it error prone, expensive and anything but infallible.' LEFT: In this file photo from July 2, 1988, convicted kidnapper and torture killer Gary Heidnik leaves Philadelphia City Hall after being sentenced to die.  Heidnik, executed by lethal injection on July 6, 1999, was the last person to have the death penalty enforced upon in Pennsylvania. RIGHT: This undated Pennsylvania Department of Corrections file photo shows Terrance Williams who is on death row for fatally beating Amos Norwood in 1984 in Philadelphia. Williams, who could have become the first person since 1999 to be executed in the state, is getting a reprieve from Wolf . The reasons for the state's lack of executions have long been debated in Pennsylvania legal circles. Some have attributed it to death penalty opposition among judges on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals or to aggressive tactics by lawyers who defend people facing execution. Others say the number of stayed or overturned death sentences demonstrates there are flaws in how those cases are handled, particularly when it comes to providing adequate representation at trial. Wolf, a Democrat, had promised a death penalty moratorium during his fall campaign against his predecessor, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. The Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association said Wolf had no authority to impose the moratorium, calling it a misuse of the concept of a reprieve. 'He has rejected the decisions of juries that wrestled with the facts and the law before unanimously imposing the death penalty, disregarded a long line of decisions made by Pennsylvania and federal judges, ignored the will of the Legislature, and ultimately turned his back on the silenced victims of cold-blooded killers,' the association said in a written statement. An association spokeswoman said legal action in response was likely, and possible options were already being discussed at a meeting Friday of the group's executive committee in Pittsburgh. The head of the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association called the decision a sad day for the state and noted that Eric Frein, accused of killing  state trooper Cpl. Bryon Dickson in the Poconos last year, would have faced a potential death sentence if convicted. 'Gov. Wolf's decision today is a travesty because it prevents the commonwealth and the family of Cpl. Dickson from securing the penalty that is deserved. This decision also will affect the families of victims from all across the state who have had their loved ones torn from them due to senseless acts of violence from dangerous criminals,' said the group's president, Joseph Kovel.","Wolf said the suspension will remain in effect at least until he receives a report from a  commission studying the topic for about four years .

"The pilot of doomed flight MH370 was distraught over his wife’s decision to move out of their family home and could have taken the plane for a ‘last joyride’ before it crashed into the southern Indian Ocean killing all 239 people on board, says a long-time friend of the pilot. The friend, also a pilot, said Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah had been left rattled by his family problems, and didn’t appear to be in the right state of mind to be flying. He warned that it was ‘very possible that neither the passengers nor the other crew on-board knew what was happening until it was too late’. ‘He's one of the finest pilots around and I'm no medical expert, but with all that was happening in his life Zaharie was probably in no state of mind to be flying,’ he told the NZ Herald on the condition of anonymity. Scroll down for video . 'Last joyride': A close friend says Captain Zaharie was upset over the breakdown of his marriage, and wasn't in the right frame of mind to fly . Virtual reality: A close friend of Captain Zaharie says the pilot might have seen MH370 as a chance to try things he'd only previously been able to try on his simulator . While his professional record appeared impeccable, Captain Zaharie's long-time friend said the pilot's personal life was in turmoil. He said his friend's relationships were breaking down, and while Zaharie was involved with another woman he was still devastated at his wife's decision to move out of their family home. He said the troubled pilot could have seen MH370 as an opportunity to try high-risk maneuvers he'd perfected on his beloved flight simulator. These shocking new claims follow reports that flight MH370 climbed to between 43,000 and 45,000ft shortly after the last voice communication from the cockpit of the plane.

An aviation industry source, who wished to remain anonymous, told MailOnline: 'It was tracked flying at this altitude for 23 minutes before descending. Oxygen would have run out in 12 minutes [in a depressurised cabin], rendering the passengers unconscious.' The 777-200ER Boeing aircraft used on the ill-fated flight has a maximum service ceiling of 43,000 feet and can very probably fly safely at even greater heights, one expert said. But at this altitude, where the atmosphere drastically thins, it would take mere minutes if not seconds for hypoxia - a lack of oxygen - to set in if the cabin was manually depressurised by one of the pilots, as seen in the below video of a high-altitude experiment. Oxygen masks would have dropped down, but these only supply between five and 10 minutes of gas. Central Queensland University's head of aviation, Ron Bishop, told MailOnline that a drop in cabin pressure that had knocked out passengers and crew would mean the plane would fly on unmanned until eventually running out of fuel and crashing into ocean. ‘You’d just slowly pass out. But it would have no effect on the plane at all,’ he said. ‘The plane would just keep going until it eventually ran out of fuel. ‘That would explain it all. That plane flew on a very long time, all the way from South East Asia to near the west coast of Australia.’ Crew onboard HMAS Success line the decks as the ship makes a turn after a potential sighting was reported in the search for the missing plane .

"Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, who was mugged outside his home last month, said receiving £330,000 from well-wishers was 'like a fairy story' as he spoke at a glitzy ball in his honour. The celebration was organised by Katie Cutler, the 21-year-old beautician who started the fundraising campaign which led to 25,000 people donating worldwide. The 4ft 6in visually-impaired pensioner, 67, said he still had no firm plans on how to spend the money but has previously hinted at buying a house near his new friend Katie. Scroll down for video . 'Fairy story': Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, pictured with Katie Cutler, who organised the appeal, thanked people who donated as he spoke at a celebration thrown in his honour . Mr Barnes broke his collar bone after the attack outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, last month. The pensioner was left too scared to return home, but Katie's appeal has left him with enough money to start fresh. At the ball in the Assembly Rooms in Newcastle, Mr Barnes said: 'It is just absolutely like a fairy story. You might read about it in a book, but it has come true. It is hard to find the words really, it was just a total, total surprise.' Mr Barnes, who also plans to undertake charity work, spoke of his recovery. He said: 'I'm getting there. I can do small things like clean my teeth and get a bath now, eat biscuits and sweets with that hand. 'I haven't attempted to open doors with that hand, I want my fracture to heal before that.' He spoke modestly of his painful break, calling it an 'inconvenience', adding: 'I didn't think you got people fundraising for that.' Katie Cutler, the 21-year-old beautician who started the fundraising campaign which led to 25,000 people donating worldwide, handed Mr Barnes the huge sum of money this evening . The 4ft 6in visually-impaired pensioner, 67, said he had no firm plans on how to spend the money but has previously hinted at buying a house near his new friend Katie . Katie, who handed over the official cheque this evening, said: 'It gives you a warm feeling inside when you help people.' Around 150 people bought tickets for the event, with many more special guests invited along. When she set up the fund for Mr Barnes her aim was to raise £500 to pay for new curtains and carpets if he moved house. The appeal quickly spiraled as more and more people donated, with Mr Barnes eventually calling on pledges to stop when the total passed £300,000. 'It doesn't feel real,' she said. 'It has been very overwhelming. Once it dies down and things get back to normality, that's when it will sink in.' The fund was originally set up to raise £500 for the pensioner, but ended up with a total of more than £300,000 . Mr Barnes - who was born with sight and growth problems after his mother contracted German Measles during pregnancy and now stands at just over four feet tall - vowed earlier this week not to spend the money on 'flashy holidays'. Richard Gatiss has been charged over the incident . He said: 'I have really enjoyed today and I now know where I am going to live. I'm going to get a house in Greenside near to Katie. 'If we're going to be doing things together all the time then it seems sensible to not be living too far away. He added: 'I've decided that's where I want to go and I would like that to happen. I'm not sure how easy that will be but I'm sure we can think of something. 'My life is like three chapters, I've had the attempted robbery and mugging, then Katie came on the scene and now we get to do exciting things together.' Katie said: 'It would be lovely if Alan moved near me. There are some great houses with nice gardens that he can use his gardening skills in. 'He can also come over to mine for BBQs and stuff in the summer.' Richard Gatiss, 25, appeared at Gateshead Magistrates' Court this week charged with assault with intent to rob. The case has been transferred to Newcastle Crown Court where Gatiss is set to appear on February 24.","Glitzy celebration thrown in honour of disabled pensioner Alan Barnes .

"With its beautiful architecture, colourful characters and Caribbean sunshine it's not hard to see why so many people are flocking to explore the Cuban capital Havana in case it changes for good. Since it was announced last year that talks were underway to lift restrictions on Americans visiting the country there has been a surge in the number of tourists wanting to see it for themselves. Online searches for trips  were reportedly up by a staggering 95 per cent with tourists  being warned that if they want to see 'the real Cuba' they should book their trips now. Smoke break: A Cuban woman puffs on an enormous cigar as she fans herself on a street in Old Havana . Last month the new regulations were passed allowing Americans to visit the country for any of a dozen specific reasons, including family visits, education and religion, without first obtaining a special license from the U.S. government as was previously the case. Though general tourism will still be banned, those U.S. travelers who do visit will be allowed to bring home small amounts of the Cuban cigars that are highly rated by aficionados. The revamped rules will also make it easier for U.S. companies to export mobile phone devices and software as well as to provide Internet services in Cuba. U.S. airlines will be permitted to expand flights to the Caribbean island. As part of resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba, the US will soon reopen an embassy in the capital of Havana and carry out high-level exchanges and visits between the governments.

TravelSupermarket travel expert Bob Atkinson is urging anyone who is thinking of visiting Cuba to book sooner rather than later. Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Atkinson said: 'It really is a unique place to visit, and once it becomes fully open to the Americans, they will without doubt pile in. 'Havana was seen as a party destination for Americans years ago, such was its close proximity to Florida. 'However you look at it, opening up to the Americans will change the way it feels and I think this will be to the detriment to the culture and heritage of the place. 'I would urge anyone who is thinking of visiting Cuba to book now; there is something about Cuba that you just can't put your finger on. 'I would say go now, as you cannot be sure the culture and heritage of Cuba will remain as it is now.' As one of the popular Caribbean destinations for travellers around the world, Cuba also remains one of the most affordable, and there is a good choice of flights available from the UK. 'On the one hand it is very evident that change will come at some stage, and that the younger generation of Cubans are waiting for that to happen. While they have excellent education and healthcare, there is still real poverty, and they lack things that we all take for granted such as a choice of goods to buy (food is mostly from ration shops) and access to the internet and to world news.'

Early in his presidency, Obama allowed unlimited family visits by Cuban-Americans and removed a $1,200 annual cap on remittances. Secretary of State John Kerry is also launching a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terror. Obama does not have the authority to fully lift the long-standing US economic embargo on Cuba, given that Congress enacted that policy.

'She's 18 pounds of pure, cute, beautiful cheeks,' Al said of Savannah's adorable daughter. Scroll down for video . Proud mom: Savannah Guthrie brought her daughter Vale to the Today Show studio in New York City on Friday morning . Major milestone: The little girl, who was born last August, celebrated her six-month birthday on Friday . When the new mom brought out Vale, her co-hosts immediately began gushing over the precious baby. 'Vale has made the scene on her six-month anniversary,' Matt announced. 'It's hard to believe it’s six months already,' Al noted as Savannah helped her daughter to show her fellow anchors how 'she likes to stand tall'. 'How does she feel about little blue stuffed animals?' Matt asked the new mom before he presented the little girl with a plush Cookie Monster. Fan favorite: Savannah's co-hosts Tamron Hall, Matt Lauer and Al Roker couldn't help but gush over her baby girl . Time flies: Al noted that he couldn't believe that Vale was already six months old . Thoughtful present: Matt gifted the baby a small Cookie Monster stuffed animal before she met the iconic character in person . Vale was then introduced to the real Cookie Monster - who also fell in love with the little girl. 'You're so pretty,' the puppet told her. And Vale was equally memorized by the iconic blue character. But while Vale was overcome with excitement at meeting the Cookie Monster and the team’s new canine companion, Savannah was most delighted to see that her daughter's face had been placed on the show’s special jar of Smucker's jelly, which they use to celebrate milestone birthdays and anniversaries.

"They are largely thought to have roamed the freezing landscapes of Europe during the last ice age, but it seems Neanderthals may have spread far further east and lived alongside modern humans there for longer than was previously thought. Two new pieces of research have suggested that the ancestors of modern East Asians may have interbred with the now extinct Neanderthals far more than they did in Europe. Analysis of the traces of Neanderthal DNA found in the genomes of modern humans has shown that people in East Asia carry between 15 to 30 per cent more of their DNA than Europeans. Scroll down for videos . Neanderthals have typically been protrayed as being mainly European, but they may have lived further East . Scientists now say there appears to be two distinct occasions when Neanderthal mixed with modern humans in East Asia compared to just one occasion in Europe. This suggests that Neanderthals were able to spread further towards East Asia than was previously thought. An ancient partial skull has provided the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside Neanderthals and could have interbred 55,000 years ago. Recently discovered in Manot Cave in West Galilee, Israel, the bone sheds new light on our ancient relatives living in the area. The find challenged previous theories that the two species potentially met 45,000 years ago somewhere in Europe. Modern Europeans have inherited between two and percent of their genes from Neanderthals, meaning the two groups mated at some point in the past. A recent study also suggested that many modern diseases are actually caused by DNA that we inherited from this now extinct branch of the human evolutionary tree. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes. Some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Almost all of the remains of Neanderthals have been found in southern Europe and western Asia. They were not thought to have gone much further east than the Altai Mountains in central Asia, on the borders of what are now Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. But the new findings have raised the prospect that Neanderthals lived in the east of the continent and may have clung on there for longer than their European relatives, who died out around 30,000 years ago - we have just yet to find the archaeological evidence. Professor Joshua Akey, a geneticist at the University of Washington who led one of two new studies, said: 'The history of admixture between modern humans and Neanderthals is most likely more complex than previously thought.' The research was conducted by two separate teams working at the University of Washington and the University of California, Los Angeles. Professor Akey and his colleague Benjamin Vernot analysed distinctive patterns in the DNA of 379 modern Europeans and 286 modern East Asians from China and Japan. Using computer models they attempted to simulate how the mixtures of Neanderthal DNA seen in the European and East Asian genomes could have occurred . They concluded that one theory - that modern Europeans interbred more with populations from Africa to water down the Neanderthal DNA they carried - was unlikely. Much of what we know about Neanderthals has come from examining their bones, like the skull above, but now DNA extracted from their fossilised remains is helping to shed new light on what their lives were like . Instead they found it was more likely that ancestors of the East Asian populations had bred with Neanderthals more than once. Mr Vernot said: 'One thing that complicates these analyses is the fact that humans have been constantly migrating throughout their history - this makes it hard to say exactly where interactions with Neanderthals occurred. 'It's possible, for example, that all of the interbreeding with Neanderthals occurred in the Middle East, before the ancestors of modern non-Africans spread out across Eurasia. 'In the model from the paper, the ancestors of all non-Africans interbred with Neanderthals, and then split up into multiple groups that would later become Europeans, East Asians. 'Shortly after they split up, the ancestors of East Asians interbred with Neanderthals just a little bit more. 'The important thing is that we show that we didn't just meet Neanderthals once in our history - it looks like we met them multiple times. 'But as we are able to look at individuals from more and more populations, we'll hopefully get a better idea of where our ancestors have been, and where they may have interacted with Neanderthals.' Previous research has led to theories that modern humans first interbred with Neanderthals as they migrated through the Middle East 55,000 years ago before they then moved further into Europe and Asia. The evidence that a second mixing between the two species took place among East Asian populations implies that this occurred sometime later and further East than the first interbreeding event. This ancient partial skull found in Manot Cave in Israel is thought to provide earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside Neanderthals and could have interbred in the area around 55,000 years ago . Previous research has led to theories that modern humans first interbred with Neantherthals as they migrated through the Middle East 55,000 years ago before they then moved further into Europe and Asia. The evidence that a second mixing between the two species took place among East Asian populations implies that this occurred sometime later and further East than the first interbreeding event. Professor Akey says it is also possible that European ancestors bred with another as yet undiscovered species of ancient human that led to the Neanderthal DNA being watered down. However the second study conducted by Dr Kirk Lohmueller, an evolutionary geneticist at the UCLA, used similar computer models and found that the most likely explanation was that Neanderthals interbred with humans multiple times in Asia. Dr Lohmueller said: 'It's very hard to put these findings into spatial context. 'The key idea is that there would have to have been some additional interbreeding events involving East Asians, but not Europeans. 'These interbreeding events could have been directly between Neanderthals and East Asians, maybe in some other indirect way.' Dr Simon Underdown, an athropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the findings should profoundly change our view of what Neanderthals were like. Neanderthals were thought to have been better adapted to the cold which allowed them to live in Europe and northern Asia through much of the last ice age before they died out around 30,000 years ago . He said: 'It strongly suggests that rather than a one off interbreeding event between humans and Neanderthals around 60,000 years ago there must have been multiple occurrences of humans and Neanderthals having sex and producing offspring. 'This in turn suggests that the boundaries between humans and Neanderthals as different species are increasingly becoming blurred almost to the point of being non-existent. 'This of course has huge significant for those who wrongly claim the neanderthals were less intelligent, didn’t have symbolism and couldn’t speak. 'We can no longer think of Homo sapiens as the ‘top dog’ who replaced the more primitive hominin species it encountered on the long trip out of Africa. 'Rather we should think of our direct ancestors as one member of a diverse genus that interbred with other members of Homo multiple times and in multiple locations.' Professor Chris Stringer, one of the world's leading anthropologists at the Natural History Museum in London, added that our view of Neanderthals had perhaps wrongly become too 'Eurocentric'. He said: 'The common view is that Neanderthals were 'European', because that is where the original and the most famous remains of this species have been discovered. 'But we have known since the 1930s that they were in Asia too, and we now have their fossils from sites in countries like Israel, Syria, Iraq and Uzbekistan. 'More fragmentary remains have recently been studied in Siberia, and the highest quality Neanderthal genome is from Denisova Cave in the Altai. 'While there have been claims that Neanderthals lingered longest in places like Gibraltar, we only have a poor fix on the dating of their disappearance further East. 'So it is certainly quite possible that there was further interbreeding with late Neanderthals as modern humans traversed Asia, although we still lack decent fossil evidence from many regions, particularly in southern Asia.'","Scientists say Neanderthals and humans may have interbred multiple times .

The structure, which is without leaves or full branches, has left many residents frustrated, especially as major cuts announced last year were predicted to cost as many as 300 jobs. Knowsley Council has called the piece 'absolutely spectacular', but many have taken to social media site Facebook to call it a 'monstrosity'. Deborah McLean said: 'Speechless, words fail me.' Kirk Phillips wrote: 'Have a guess who is paying for that plazzy tree.....that's where your council tax is going.' And Billy Elliott added: 'What a monstrosity. How can they call it the tree of life when it looks dead? Not a leaf in sight.' Controversial: The piece of art, called 'The Tree of Life', was put up in Kirkby town centre in Merseyside after supermarket giant Tesco pulled out of plans for a new store for the town . But Geoff Wood, the artist behind the tree, is hoping it will grow on people. He said: 'This tree was based on the oldest tree in the borough but it was a very sick tree. It was falling down, it was dangerous so it had to be felled anyway, so I suggested we should cast it in iron and give it a new life. 'The tree was over 400 years old so, with it, it carries all the memories of all the people who have lived during that time.' He says it is not yet finished and is one of three art pieces. Others called 'Three thrones' and 'Edward's Elephant' are set to follow. Nine tonnes of molten iron went into making the tree. A golden disc, which will catch the sunlight and provide some shelter from the rain, will complete the design. Mocking: Many people have taken to Twitter to ridicule the new sculpture, thought to have cost up to £60,000 . Under fire: Many are questioning Knowsley Council's decision to put money towards the dead tree sculpture, Pictured above, the council's headquarters . A spokesperson for Knowsley Council said: 'The tree is absolutely spectacular and will be a real focal point in the new-look town centre. 'The idea for the tree came from discussions with local people who wanted a piece of art to illustrate strength and roots in the local community and a place they could meet up with friends in the town centre.' 'The idea for the tree came from discussions with local people who wanted a piece of art to illustrate strength and roots in the local community and a place they could meet up with friends in the town centre. 'We have engaged with local schools and community groups throughout the process and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Local people have really played their part in creating this piece of art and we are sure they will love it for years to come. 'The overall cost of the three new pieces of public art in Kirkby town centre is £320,000. This is made up of significant contributions from Tesco and arts funding grants, along with council funding, so this money could only have been used for public art and not for any other purpose.'","'The Tree of Life' was erected in Kirkby town centre in Merseyside .

"A fire that ripped through the $18.5 million Malibu mansion of actor Pierce Brosnan on Wednesday has caused $1million in damage. The former James Bond star and his family were home when the blaze erupted in the property's garage, calling authorities and exiting the residence when they were alerted by a smoke alarm. Some sources are now saying an appliance in the garage caused the flames. Scroll down for video . A fire that ripped through the $18.5 million Malibu mansion (above) of actor Pierce Brosnan on Wednesday has caused $1million in damage . Brosnan (above) and his family were home at the time of the blaze . When asked for comment, Brosnan said he just wanted everyone to know that he and his family were safe . KTLA reports that as many as 20 firefighters responded to the first-alarm residential fire and put the flames out within 30 minutes. As a result, only the garage and a nearby guest bedroom sustained any damage. Brosnan, who was home with wife Keely Shaye Smith and two of his sons at the time, Dylan and Paris, could be seen distraught as he spoke on his phone while firefighters put out the blaze. Investigators stayed on the scene at the 13,000 square-foot residence for hours after the blaze was put out as they tried to determine what the cause was. One neighbor, Andy Stern, claimed; 'Their last house totally burned down several years ago, then it took them several years to build this house. A concerned Pierce and his family spoke to firefighters . Some sources are now saying an appliance in the garage caused the flames . As many as 20 firefighters responded to the first-alarm residential fire and put the flames out within 30 minutes . Only the garage and a nearby guest bedroom sustained any damage . He then added; 'It’s an unusual house. Going through the permitting process and building it just took a long time.' It seems that this may not be true however, as Brosnan razed the existing property when he purchased it to build this eco-friendly beachfront abode. 'Pierce and Keely have always been dedicated environmentalists and they were determined that their dream home would set a new standard in being eco-friendly,' a source previously told The Mail on Sunday. ‘All the windows are non-glare, insulated glass and there is a centrally controlled climate and lighting system that will automatically turn off the lights if a room is left vacant for more than five minutes. 'The climate control will automatically adjust various rooms to maximise energy savings. It’s an eco palace. ‘Pierce has been actively involved in every single aspect, right down to choosing the natural recycled wood for the kitchen benches and the low-flow toilets.’ When asked for comment, Brosnan said he just wanted everyone to know that he and his family were safe. The average property on the street, with neighbors including Steven Spielberg, Goldie Hawn, Mel Gibson, Cher, Dustin Hoffman and Danny DeVito, is valued at $10million.","A fire that ripped through the $18.5 million Malibu mansion of actor Pierce Brosnan on Wednesday has caused $1million in damage .

"Spending long hours at work could lead to relationships beyond the professional kind. With every relationship, comes a catch that could lead to a heartbreak but when it comes to office romances, it could mean tricky business. From risking careers to a short fling at an after-work-drinks – no matter how far you go in keeping it a secret – it’s important to prepare yourself if things end on a sour note. With Valentine’s Day fast approaching, Randstad’s group director Steve Shepherd, 49, shares his professional and personal experiences on dealing with a sticky situation and how it could turn into a long-term prospect if you play your cards right. Steve Shepherd, from Melbourne and his wife Joanne met when they were working together 27 years ago . Be discreet. Being overly affectionate or making it too obvious in a relationship or even a fling in front of colleagues would not result in a good outcome . Do tread carefully. Always keep it at a professional level and control your behaviour. If your relationship turns soar - not only will it affect the both of you, it'll harm the rest of your office or put your career in jeopardy - so be sensible about it . Do think about the consequences. Before plunging into a relationship, you need to consider why you're doing it and whether you can both work professionally and maintain your romance outside of working hours? Don't involve too many people. Depending on how it goes in your relationship - only involve your colleagues when you know things are heading in the right direction . Don't keep it a secret for too long. Most people tend to build it up inside because they think of the worst case-scenario if they tell their colleagues but most of the time - it's a positive reaction and it'll end those rumours . ‘If you’re in a relationship at work – my advice is discretion,’ Mr Shepherd told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Being overly affectionate or making it obvious with actions in front of other colleagues tends to not have a good outcome. ‘And if a relationship goes soar, trying to hide your emotions could have an impact – not only yourself on terms of how you perform in the workforce but it could harm the dynamics of a team environment.' Whether sparks fly or the chemistry is heating up, Mr Shepherd said it’s important to consider the consequences and what that potentially means for their career before starting anything serious. ‘We spend most of our waking lives at work and when you’re working at a large company and you’re single – the chances are – you’ll meet someone because it’s inevitable,' he said. ‘The real things to consider are keeping it at a professional level and control your behaviour. ‘We’re all here to do our jobs but if you get yourself into a little fling and not much is in it for either of you – don’t tell anybody. Not only will you put your career in jeopardy but it could be frowned upon. 'As long as you know what you're getting yourself into and it's not affecting your job - then it won't affect me and the rest of the office.' The pair have been happily married since with two children after colleagues and bosses attended their big day . The 49-year-old from Melbourne met his wife Joanne at work many years ago. ‘We were working together at another organisation at the time and we got invited to a housewarming party and we started chatting there,’ Mr Shepherd said. ‘When we started dating, we kept it on the down low and at a professional level at work for a good eight to nine months. After working for 18 months while being in a relationship, the pair got married and  Mr Shepherd said he is still happily married to his wife 27 years later. The father of two said he is pleased to say that there was never an awkward moment or a public spat at work between himself and Joanne. ‘It was important for both of us to focus on our careers and what was more important – we made it clear that we didn’t want to damage the relationship with other colleagues,' he said. Mr Shepherd said it’s important to consider the consequences before being involved in any office romance . ‘You don’t want people around you to walk on egg shells and we both stepped back and worked as co-workers but after work, we would laugh about how we interacted at work. ‘The greatest thing for us was when we started telling people - half had already known  but joked they were waiting for the day for us to come clean and others never picked up on it.' And would he recommend others to get romantically involved in an office romance too? ‘We’re still together 27 years later and I love my wife more each day. We have two great kids. How can I not recommend that?’ Mr Shepherd said. ‘Always tread with caution and make sure you have a great life and career – not one or the other. 'Be sensible. If you get wind up in another office fling – maybe consider having one less wine glass at the next function,’ he laughed. ‘Common sense prevails.’ Mr Shepherd is not the only person who has found love inside an office. Andy and his wife Fiona met six years ago when they worked together at an agency company in London . Andy, who wished to not give his surname, met his wife Fiona, 34, while they were both working in the same agency company more than six years ago. ‘It was one of those situations where you’re working long hours and spending lots of time together – you just grow fond of each other,’ 33-year-old Andy told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We kept it a secret at first because we didn’t know if it would progress after a couple of dates or turn into a long term thing. ‘But overtime, we started to tell one or two people and it grew from there. It obviously got serious and people were talking about it so we came out and said we were an item. It took the couple six months before progressing into a serious relationship but Andy admits it was quite challenging to maintain at first. ‘One thing that helped was, we worked in different teams so it’s certainly different when you’re working with each other every day,’ Andy said. ‘When we started telling people, most of the office had already known so it was the worst kept secret,’ Andy laughed. The pair hit it off and they both shared similar interests and ambitions - they had plans to travel the world . Andy and his wife married last year in Scotland where their colleagues and bosses attended the big day . When it comes to working, it could also be a great place to meet a potential partner with similar interests and ambitions as Andy discovered they both dreamt about travelling the world. ‘Neither of us thought we’d be working together for the rest of our lives and we knew we both wanted to travel,' Andy said. ‘We moved to Australia four years ago and got married last year in Scotland [where my wife is from]. Lots of our colleagues came to the wedding as well. ‘I think if you’re serious with each other, then there is nothing to worry about starting a relationship in the workplace. 'The only negative comment I got was ""you're punching above your weight"",' Andy laughed. Andy, who now lives in Sydney with his wife, said it was important to make it public to colleagues and bosses that you're in a serious relationship with another colleague because 'it’ll tear up those office rumours'. ‘A lot of people think it's a bad situation or it’s not going down well if they tell people but often what we picture in our minds would be different in reality,' Andy said. 'And in most cases, it’s actually not bad at all and you'd be surprised with the positive reaction. 'We've been happily married since and I plan to start a family with her in the future.'","Meet the two Aussie men who married their colleague sweethearts .

"A woman who caused a horror car crash which killed a four year-old's parents and left him orphaned was jailed for a year earlier today. Debra Weston, 41, admitted losing control of her green Land Rover Discovery and smashing into a family's Ford Focus. Stephen Durber, 30, and his wife Samantha 27, who were travelling in the back of the Ford with their son Lucas, died at the scene. Debra Weston, left, was jailed for a year today after pleading guilty to causing the deaths of Stephen Durber and his wife Samantha in a crash in August 2013. Mr Durber's brother David, right, said justice has been done . Stephen Durber, left, and his wife Samantha, right were killed in the crash and Lucas, centre, was badly hurt . The youngster survived with two broken legs and a head injury. Witnesses described seeing Weston's Discovery swerve towards the wrong side of the road before 'fishtailing' as she tried to regain control of it. She suffered a broken ankle and her teenage son who was a passenger suffered a broken leg. Weston, of Nottingham, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by careless driving after the crash on the A47 near Sacrewell Farm, Cambridgeshire, on August 25 2013. She was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for three years at Peterborough Crown Court. Judge Sean Enright said: 'It is clear that Stephen and Samantha were a happy and hard working couple known for their sound principals and sense of fun. 'They were good parents. Nothing that I can say can capture the essence of this couple and the tragic and enduring loss to their family and son. 'I hope that no member of the family will hear the sentence I pass today and say - well is that the value that society places on our loved ones? 'Because it is not. This defendant has pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving - not dangerous driving - and I am required to consider and apply case law and guidance sanctioned by law. 'In particular I need to balance the culpability of the defendant, which is low, and the tragic consequences which resulted.' Stephen's brother David Durber who lived near the Peterborough couple, said: 'We believe justice has been served.'","Debra Weston lost control and smashed into a car travelling the other way .

"A senior teacher is being made redundant in Dundee after councillors refused to reduce their drinks budget by £44,000. Norma Seith is set to lose her post at the Menzieshill Young Mum's Unit (YMU) - which helps teenage mothers stay in education. Ms Seith is principal teacher and manager of the organisation, which provides support to young 'fragile' women  who 'have seen their lives  become very, complicated'. Scroll down for video . Teacher Norma Seith is set to lose her post at the Menzieshill Young Mum's Unit in Dundee after councillors refused to reduce their drinks budget by £44,000 . The SNP administration has refused to cut their drinks budget despite the alternative being the removal of Ms Seith from her post. More than 1,000 people have now signed a petition urging the council to reverse their decision and opposition groups rallied round the unit today, proposing a series of alternative savings, The Courier reports. Derek Scott, the Conservative member for Broughty Ferry, suggested slashing food and refreshment for councillors, alcohol purchases and hospitality budgets. He claimed that by saving £44,000 in the entertainment allowance, the council could afford to employ the principal teacher at the YMU. However, his motion was defeated by SNP members who pushed ahead with their proposals — and Labour councillors who declined to vote. Clare McGraw, whose daughter uses the YMU, told members at today's meeting that the unit was crucial in helping those who become pregnant while in education. She said: 'Any changes to the YMU should be done with care and attention, given the crucial support it provides. Protesters who signed a 1,000-strong petition calling for the council to reverse their decision rallied outside the school today . '(Education convener) Stewart Hunter has already said to me that the planning could have been better. 'The principal teacher has been there for 24 years and is essential as a relationship with those involved in the unit. This amounts to a dismantling of the YMU.' SNP finance spokesman Councillor Willie Sawers said: 'This is the ninth year in a row that the council tax has been frozen in Dundee. 'Within the savings proposed for council services, we have made absolutely every effort we can to protect the quality of the services we provide.' On their website, the YMU says it 'caters for the extra needs of pregnant schoolgirls and young mothers with their babies from across the city. 'The unit is staffed by a Principal Teacher, supported by a designated YMU support worker and two qualified Early Years Practitioners.' Ms Seith was unavailable for comment today. Speaking to the Evening Telegraph last month, the teacher spoke of the crucial work that the YMU do in helping young mothers. She said: 'The emphasis is on continuing the girls' education. But there's also input from us on parenting skills, nutrition and many other aspects of motherhood. 'And whilst some girls have been around other children — brothers, sisters, cousins — others are terrified at the prospect of being a mum.'","SNP administration voted to retain alcohol budget over saving senior role .

"Ever mindlessly 'liked' a total stranger's picture on Instagram? One man did just that - and the photo's owner turned out to be his future wife. Andrew Dearling, 28, from London, was scouring the social media site one day when he stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page, liking a few of her snaps. Nicole lived over 4,000 miles away and was engaged to someone else when she 'liked' some of Andrew's photos back. A slew of communication followed via text messages and FaceTime, which later resulted in a plane journey, a first meeting, and then a guest-free wedding.

"Two women managed to escape with just minor injuries after their car plummeted 60ft off a bridge. Driver Elizabeth Wolthoff, 25, and passenger Rebecca Winslow, 23, were in a SUV when it veered off the Route 80 bridge in Hackensack, New Jersey, and dropped into the lot below on Friday. First responders arrived at the scene and found the pair trapped inside. Miraculous: Two were in the car when it veered off the Route 80 bridge in Hackensack, New Jersey . Lucky escape: Driver Elizabeth Wolthoff, 25, (left) and passenger Rebecca Winslow, 23, (right) were stuck in the car for 20 minutes as firefighters remove arts of the car to get them out . It took firefighters around 20 minutes to cut the pair free before they were taken to Hackensack University Medical Center, NJ.com reported. They had to remove the roof and one of the doors in order to get the pair out. Firefighter Michael Thomasey told CBS 2: 'Everybody that saw the distance that the car fell was just taken back by the fact that they had not been injured more severely and that they were able to talk to us. Sgt. Jeff Flynn, a State Police spokesman, said the single-car crash was reported at 7:12 a.m. on the highway's eastbound lanes. The cause of the wreck remained under investigation, Flynn said. Workers nearby said they saw a snow embankment with two tire tracks nearby, and feel the flare of the sun may have been to blame. Hackensack Fire Lt. Justin Derevyanik, who was one of the first on the scene, told CBS: 'God was watching over them today. It landed on a tree which probably padded the fall a little bit and then on a fence.' Other officers said if the car had landed on its roof it would have been a different story.

"Disgraced former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius is being treated 'like royalty' in prison because guards are terrified of the public backlash should he come to any harm while serving his sentence. The double-amputee is understood to have spent the majority of his four months incarcerated at Kgosi Mampuru II jail in Pretoria by himself, as prison officers are concerned he could be attacked or even killed if he is left to fend for himself among the general prison population. Tomorrow marks the two-year anniversary of the Valentine's Day shooting that left Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead and lead to him being sentenced to five years in prison for culpable homicide.

Disgraced: Former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius (left) is being treated 'like royalty' in prison because guards are terrified of the public backlash should he come to any harm while serving his sentence . Pistorius has so far served four months behind bars and is believed to have already settled in to life at Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria. Correctional officers have refused to discuss his treatment in prison, but one guard speaking on condition of anonymity told Eyewitness News that the Paralympian is being treated 'like royalty'. The official suggested that Pistorius' management had raised concerns for the former athlete's safety, leading to prison guards doing their utmost to ensure their high-profile prisoner avoids any situation where he could be physically assaulted. Pistorius was last year jailed for five years for killing  Steenkamp. One of his lawyer's has claimed he was expected to serve a sixth of the sentence - around 10 months - in jail before being held under house arrest. Pistorius was banned from all disabled competitions for five years following the conviction by the International Paralympic Committee, irrespective of whether he secures an early release. Grief: Barry Steenkamp, father of Reeva Steenkamp, is consoled by his wife June during the sentencing hearing of Olympic and Paralympic track star Oscar Pistorius . Brazilian Paralympian Alan Oliveira (left) said he wanted to see six-time Paralympic champion Oscar Pistorius (right) compete again, telling BBC Sport: 'I wish he'd come back and we could run more times together . Earlier this week Brazilian Paralympian Alan Oliveira said he wanted Pistorius to return to competitive action when he is eventually released from prison. Oliveira said he wanted to see the six-time Paralympic champion compete again, telling BBC Sport: 'I wish he'd come back and we could run more times together.' Pistorius made history at London 2012 by competing at the Olympics and the Paralympics, where he won two gold medals but finished second in the 200 metres behind Oliveira. After the race the South African hit out at the IPC for failing to act over the length of some athletes' blades after the Brazilian, wearing noticeably longer ones, came from way back to pip him at the line. However, Oliveira hopes to line up against his arch-rival again. The 22-year-old added: 'I think it'd be a good competition to see the two of us together again - repeating the duel seen in London. 'It's difficult for him to return and it would depend on how he is feeling, shaping up and of course his age, but I believe he could return and it would be great.'","Prison guards are said to be terrified of Pistorius coming to harm in jail .

"Elizabeth Outram, who was 'dreading exposure on national TV', killed herself on her 30th birthday, an inquest heard . A young woman who was 'dreading exposure on national TV' after  switching the price tags on a jacket from TK Maxx, killed herself on her 30th birthday, an inquest heard. Elizabeth Outram was found hanged  at her home in Hackney, east London, after a night celebrating with friends at the Shard. An inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court was reportedly told that before her death she had been charged with fraud after she swapped the price tags on a leather jacket at the Brighton branch of discount department store TK Maxx. A television crew following a police operation in Brighton filmed Miss Outram being led out of the shop after she had attempted to buy the jacket for a friend's rock-themed hen party. Miss Outram's sister Alexandra, 31, told the inquest her sister had been traumatised by the incident and was hounded by Renegade Pictures production company. 'She was traumatised by it and was filmed by a production company, I think it was Renegade productions company, they hounded her,' her sister told the inquest. 'They kept sending her messages and calling her. She called them up pretending to be me, she was too ashamed to tell me initially but I would have done the same. She called telling them to leave her alone. 'At that point she told them she was receiving psychiatric treatment and she wasn't well but it was just ignored.' Miss Outram reportedly attempted to take her own life in August 14 last year when she was due to appear in court to face the charges. A film crew recorded her as she was led away by police after switching the price tags on a jacket from TK Maxx, an inquest heard . Her sister said there should have been more support for someone with a history of severe mental health problems. 'She was made to go to court, even though she was going through a really difficult espisode and that is when she took the first overdose,' Miss Outram's sister told the inquest. She was said to have been 'traumatised' by the incident and was 'hounded' by Renegade Pictures productions company, according to her sister . 'She ran out of medication, they couldn't give her more than a week's dose. 'This was the time when she really needed some kind of intervention from healthcare services, I don't know why I was never contacted ever, I only found out about this through her, why did no one contact me? 'They had my details, I know it's private but it's a suicide attempt, she was on her own. 'For someone who has a history of severe mental health problems and suicide attempts, I don't know why this case was treated this way, . 'She had extreme social anxiety, it was a constant battle for her to leave the house and I saw it, I saw her really struggling. 'I just think there should have been more support for her.' The inquest heard that around the time of the hen party, Miss Outram's mental health had improved, only to deteriorate after TK Maxx incident. It is understood that the footage will not be broadcast. After the inquest, Alexandra told the Evening Standard that her sister, who was 'embarrassed' by the incident, had been filmed by the crew as shop staff questioned her over the tags - even though she had asked the camera team not to. 'She said 'You can't film me', and they said 'We can'. She said she was ill, but they did not call her carer - me,' Alexandra said. Coroner Mary Elizabeth Hassell recorded a verdict of suicide. She said: 'She was 30 and reflecting on her life. She had an appalling experience and was dreading exposure on national TV. 'Despite making headway with her health, and despite having a very loving family, it wasn't enough.' A spokesman for Renegade Pictures production company said: 'Only a brief part of the shoplifting incident was filmed, outside the shop as Elizabeth was led to a police car by officers. No filming of Elizabeth took place inside the shop. 'Soon after her arrest, the production team were contacted and made it clear that neither she nor the incident involving her would be referred to in any way in the series to be broadcast. The production team never had contact details for Elizabeth and never attempted to contact her. 'Following Elizabeth's very sad death the production team again reassured her sister that she would not feature in any way in the series and passed on their sincere condolences for their tragic loss.' She was found hanged at her home in Malvern Road, London Fields, after a night out to celebrate the milestone birthday at the Shard on September 11 last year .

"A new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that a terrorist attack or foiled encounter has taken place every 34 days in the US since 2009 . While recent attacks in Paris and Sydney dominate the headlines, a new report has found that domestic terrorism by 'lone wolf' assailants is on the rise. A terrorist attack or foiled encounter has taken place, on average, every 34 days in the US since 2009, according to a study released today by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The watchdog group urged the government to pay more attention to domestic terrorist attacks, citing 63 victims in six years from plots carried out by American extremists, including right-wing radicals and homegrown jihadists. Mark Potok, the study's editor, said the report was not 'trying to diminish the very real jihadist threat' abroad, but rather implored the government to take notice of the dangers at home as well, according to Yahoo! News. 'We have known since Timothy McVeigh murdered 168 people in Oklahoma City in 1995 that there is a very real and very substantial threat in terms of terrorism from our fellow Americans,' he said. The concept of the 'lone wolf', defined as a person who carries out a terrorist attack entirely on his own, gained popularity in the 1980s from a violent member of the Ku Klux Klan. Louis Beam advocated for radicals to stop acting together in large groups - which only made it easier for them to get caught - and instead called for 'lone wolf action or leaderless resistance' that involved no more than six men. The SPLC study found that 74 per cent of the 63 incidents examined from April 1, 2009, through Feburary 1, 2015, were carried out or planned by a single person. And 90 per cent of the incidents were just the work of one or two people. According to the report, lone wolf's are all the more dangerous because often nobody else knows about their plan for violence. This is because homegrown terrorists are hiding themselves 'in the anonymity and safety of the Internet', Potok said. Chilling: One of the incidents included in the study were the murder of two police officers and a bystander by Jerad (left) and Amanda Miller (right), a married couple with extreme anti-government views, in Las Vegas . The 2012 massacre of six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple by a neo-Nazi, and the murder of two police officers and a bystander last summer by a Las Vegas couple with anti-government views, were two of the incidents included in the study. Following the recent attacks in Sydney and Paris, the White House will hold a summit next week to discuss countering violent extremism. Another recent terrorist act included was the massacre of six people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple by neo-Nazi Wade Michael Page (pictured) But Potok has concerns the meeting will focus too heavily 'on the threat of Islamist terrorism'. 'The government, at least in our view, has fallen down in many ways with respect to dealing with domestic terrorism' he said. National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the summit will not focus 'on any particular religion, ideology or political movement,' he wrote in an email to Yahoo News. He said the summit will 'address contemporary challenges' and attempt to 'draw lessons that are applicable to the full spectrum of violent extremists'. A task force dedicated to domestic terrorism was created after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, but it disbanded not long after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The Department of Homeland Security's team dedicated to non-Islamic domestic terrorism similarly fell apart in 2009 after it was heavily criticized for a report stating that right-wing radicalism grew exponentially following the election of Barack Obama to office in 2009. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last summer that the task force that disintegrated in 2001 would be revived, although the SPLC has noted that a meeting has yet to be held. The report found that there were two main motivations fueling domestic terrorism. Almost half of the attacks in the last six years were fueled by anti-government radicals, whereas 51 per cent of the incidents were inspired by ideologies 'of hate', including both white supremacy and radical Islamism. But after the recent attacks in Paris and Sydney, combined with the ongoing brutality of ISIS, Potok said Muslims in America are 'clearly under fire'. This week three young American-born Muslim students in North Carolina were brutally executed by their neighbor Craig Stephen Hicks. Although the most recent shooting in Chapel Hill has yet to be ruled a hate crime - police believe it was caused by a parking dispute - Potok said he believes the country will only continue to see similar violence. 'It is very likely to get worse before it gets better.'

"A former ally of Nick Clegg has accused him of being ‘insipid’ and failing to take credit for the Liberal Democrats’ role in the Coalition. Jeremy Browne said attacking the Tories ahead of the election in a desperate bid to differentiate themselves was simply a retreat to the party’s ‘comfort zone.’ In the most damning blow for his former boss, the senior MP said the party faced heavy losses at the General Election as they lack a ‘distinctive proposition’. Jeremy Browne accused the Liberal Democrats of retreating to their ‘comfort zone’ instead of defending the Coalition . The former home office minister was sacked from his job in 2013 and has since criticised his party for having failed to take credit for the economic recovery, bringing down crime or its education reforms. ‘We are in no man's land’, he said in an interview. ‘We don't have a distinctive proposition. We have sought to distance ourselves from a successful creation [the Coalition] which has required a huge amount of effort and sacrifice by us to make it successful. That is the sad irony of our position.’ Mr Browne, the MP for Taunton Deane, was once seen a rising star of the party and tipped as a future leader, but decided to stand down at the election and leave politics. Despite previous approaches by the Conservatives, he said he had ruled out joining another political party. But he has turned against his former close ally, Mr Clegg, saying that after a successful first two years in office, the Lib Dems had returned to ‘sounding like a party of protest in government’. ‘Nick Clegg made a decision that he was going to look inwards and talk to his party and reassure it, rather than look outwards and talk to the country and appeal to it’, Mr Browne told the Independent. The Lib Dems, who are predicted to lose at least half of the 57 seats they won in 2010, have said they would prop up either the Conservatives or Labour after the next election if neither wins a majority, depending on which emerges as the largest party. Mr Browne predicted that the Conservatives would emerge as the largest party, but said he believed his party would reject a second coalition at which point Mr Clegg would have to resign as leader. The Lib Dems, who have slipped to single figures in the polls, are predicted to lose at least half of the 57 seats they won in 2010 . The next leader, he predicted, would emerge as Tim Farron, the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman and standard bearer for the left of the party, who he said would lead them in opposition. But he warned that in 90 per cent of seats in the UK the Lib Dems would be in a position from which it is ‘difficult to recover’, and could come fourth, fifth or even sixth in the ballot. ‘All we offer is a desire to water down their strong views. We offer an insipid moderation. Whichever party is the biggest one, we will stop them implementing a large number of their ideas.’ He said many Lib Dems would relish a period in opposition to try and build up their strength. ‘Being leader of a smaller party would feel unfulfilling and there would be a sense that this era had come to a natural conclusion’, he said.","Jeremy Browne said the Lib Dems had retreated into its 'comfort zone'

"Two rogue builders who duped elderly homeowners out of thousands of pounds for shoddy repairs have been jailed. Johnny Jones, 48, and brother-in-law Nelson Richards, 51, inflated their prices, targeted vulnerable people for a spate of frauds between March 2012 and August 2014 in Cornwall. After being investigated by the council's trading standards over 17 separate reported incidents, the pair were jailed for three-and-a-half years and five years at Truro Crown Court today. Johnny Jones (left) and Nelson Richards (right) have been jailed after duping elderly homeowners out of thousands of pounds by performing shoddy work on their houses at inflated prices . The court heard how the average age of their victims was around 75, their oldest target being a woman now 89 who lives alone. They were discovered after disgruntled homeowners were forced to call in new builders to correct their work. Halfway through the sentencing hearing Richards, watching via video link from prison, left the room, telling the court: 'It's too much stress for me to deal with.' One of the victims was targeted just days after the married man had been released from jail, it was said. 'It started with an offer to clean out her guttering for £100 and before long he was demanding £2,000 for ‘rainy day’ repairs,' said prosecutor Ian Graham. 'The horror does not stop there as this lady was required to drive to her bank in Falmouth to take out money to pay Mr Richards for work that does not need to be done at her property. 'Over the course of a couple of months she handed over a total of £17,900. 'Very little work was done on her property. Truro Crown Court heard how the men used bullying tactics to convince elderly homeowners to pay inflated prices for unnecessary work at their homes . While one of the men involved was a legitimate builder, they used his experience and business to operate fraudulently, the court heard . 'Mr Richards ingratiated himself with her, phoning her several times a day, bringing her food she did not want.' Meanwhile Jones placed adverts in local newspapers to attract business quoting inflated prices for simple work. His victims included Kathleen Fletcher-Peters, Phyllis White, Carol Selfe, Frank Williamson, Rita Grant, Leslie Adshead and Bernadette Murphy. Mr Williamson, 81, was conned out of £13,767, which included £440 to a double glazing firm for non-existent windows, and Mrs Grant paid £5,400 for work valued by a surveyor at £3,240. Meanwhile, Richards - calling himself Richard Barton - had also targeted Mr Williamson quoting him over £36,000 for work around his home and garden. Using the alias of Nigel Andrews, Richards also convinced Anthony Birch to invest £5,500 in a non-existent caravan business. The court was told that when Mr Birch contacted Jones to ask about Richards, he was told he was dead having ridden a motorbike off a cliff. After pleading guilty to a charge of participating in a fraudulent business, Jones, a father-of-three was jailed three and a half years. Richards, who has six children, was sentenced to five years behind bars. Sentencing Judge Simon Carr said described the men as having 'preyed' on vulnerable people. Wonky pipes and messy workmanship were among the problems discovered by council investigators later . Some of the people involved in the men's fraudulent activity were duped out of tens of thousands of pounds . 'I sentence you both for what are very unpleasant offences. Often these elderly victims feel forced to hand over more for work they don’t particularly want. 'They feel unable to stand up to people like you. You prey on that.' The judge said that Jones was a 'genuine builder' and that his business had not been set up for the 'purposes of fraud'. 'However, on a number of occasions when you have come into contact with the elderly you have seen them as an easy touch,' he said. 'I take the view that Mr Richards is a professional conman who targets the vulnerable in a particularly unpleasant way.' Richards was already in custody having been recalled to prison in November 2012 following an early release on licence in February 2012, the court heard. In April 2006, Richards was jailed for seven years, later increased to 10 years upon appeal, along with three of his henchmen. At Truro Crown Court a judge described how they 'preyed' on vulnerable people, telling they they needed work done on their houses and charging outrageous rates . Together he and his gang cheated 25 elderly people across the region out of more than £660,000 between 2003 and 2005. In August 2009 his prison term was extended by another four years, for failing to adhere to a compensation order to pay back £569,869. Five others were also jailed in December 2007 for criminal actions linked to Richards, and subsequently ordered to pay back a total of £184,182 between them. Meanwhile, Jones was also previously convicted at Truro Crown Court in February 2012 for three charges of fraud and theft, relating to goods he had not paid for. He was given a nine month prison sentence, suspended for two years, together with 160 hours' community service. He was also ordered to pay compensation totalling £3,563 to his three victims. Judge Carr was told that Richards' fraud was valued at £58,530 while Jones' benefit was £45,550. As neither men had any assets both were ordered to pay under Proceeds Of Crime Act legislation a token £1 or face an extra seven days' imprisonment.","Johnny Jones and Nelson Richards were jailed at Truro Crown Court .

"These images capture the appalling conditions inside a squalid flat where two single mothers left their young children alone while they went out drinking for 12 hours. Shocking pictures show stained drawers and cupboard shelves virtually bare - but for the odd piece of garbage and collection of empty liquor bottles. The only food to be found in the kitchen was a half-eaten loaf of bread and an opened box of cereal - while the cold bedrooms' only comfort was a thin and dirty duvet. Little food: Shocking pictures taken inside the Gloucester flat show fridges and shelves virtually empty - but for the numerous empty bottles of wine and spirits . The two mothers, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the property in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at around 11pm and going on to a party where they stayed until 11am the next day. The six-year-old girl and boy, seven, had gone by the time they got back to the flat - having been collected by the police after a neighbour called at 5.40am to say the children were home alone. Officers arrived in the freezing cold flat and were shocked to discover how little there was to eat - with the only real evidence that the flat was lived in coming from the numerous empty bottles of alcohol. Police also commented on the inadequacy of the children's bedding and how there were no clothes to be found in the drawers. Avoided jail: The pair, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the older mother’s home in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at about 11pm and going onto a party where they stayed until 11am the next day . Bare shelves: The flat hardly appears lived in as the cupboard and fridge shelves are almost empty . The two mothers pleaded guilty to child neglect and were both sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years, as well as a supervision order, offender programme and overnight curfew. Their faces have been hidden to protect the identity of their children. Judge Euan Ambrose told the pair - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - he only spared them jail to avoid their children suffering further. The judge said: ‘Your decision to go out was utterly irresponsible. It amounted to the two of you putting your own selfish pleasures above the welfare of your children.’ Both children were taken into care after the offence but the boy - the son of the older woman, whose flat it was - had been returned to her after four weeks. However, the younger woman’s daughter remains in foster care - although her mother has access to her under supervision three times a week. Describing the circumstances found by the police when they arrived at the flat, Mr Kesner said they initially knocked on the door but got no reply - although they could hear movement inside. An officer opened the letterbox and saw the children. He asked if anyone else was in the flat. The boy replied: ‘My mum went to the High Street but she wasn’t here when we woke up.’ Squalid conditions: The two children, aged six and seven, were left in the property while their mothers went out drinking for 12 hours . Empty fridges: Officers arrived in the freezing cold flat and were shocked to see how little food there was . Mr Kesner said ‘On looking at the children the officer could see they appeared frightened, uncomfortable and cold. The police therefore opened the door and the little girl was crying. ‘She said she didn’t have anything to wear on her bottom half of her body so the police looked in the boy’s bedroom to see if they could find anything suitable for her to put on. ‘In his bedroom they noticed what is described as his bedding being a thin dirty duvet with no pillow. There were hardly any clothes in the chest of drawers, just a single school uniform and two T-shirts. ‘The police looked for food in the fridge and the kitchen but it was almost bare. I think Your Honour has seen the state of the kitchen with hardly any food in it. Poor bedding: The sheets and duvets found in the bedrooms were thin and dirty . Police officers were stunned by the inadequacy of the children's bedding and how there were no clothes to be found in the drawers . ‘All the police noticed were empty bottles of wine and spirits. The little girl was asked when she had last eaten. This was a Saturday morning and she said the last she had eaten was breakfast on Friday morning.’ Both women had previous criminal convictions but not for any relevant offences, Mr Kesner said. The girl’s mum had a drug conviction on her record. Lloyd Jenkins, for the girl’s mother, said: ‘There are no excuses. On April 25 she was extremely selfish. She decided to have a night out and ignore the welfare of her daughter. 12-hour drinking session: The mothers, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the property in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at around 11pm and going on to a party where they stayed until 11am the next day . ‘What she did was deplorable. She is ashamed of what she did and regrets her behaviour. She has said “I don’t know what came over me”.’ The woman had a history of depression, anxiety and alcoholism but since November last year had stopped drinking apart from a lapse over Christmas, he said. Her abusive partner was now out of her life having been sentenced to six and a half years imprisonment for grievous bodily harm, he added. Joe Maloney, for the boy’s mother, said the woman realised how stupid she had been and how much the children were at risk. ‘There have been no further difficulties since (her son) was returned to her,’ said Mr Maloney. ‘She is determined to ensure this sort of incident does not take place again.' Sentencing: Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) was told that officers found the flat was cold, there was very little food in the kitchen and the only bedding was a thin and dirty duvet with no pillow .","Pair aged 25 and 26 drank heavily at older mother's home in Gloucester .

"Furious parents have accused a school of taking autistic and dyslexic children out of classes to 'hide them' from Ofsted inspectors. Children were removed from English, maths and science lessons at Matravers School in Westbury, Wiltshire, last week as the education watchdog visited. Parents say disabled children were hidden from Ofsted because the school was criticised in its last inspection for the way it taught special needs pupils. Furious parents have accused Matravers School in Westbury, Wiltshire, of taking autistic and dyslexic children out of classes to 'hide them' from Ofsted inspectors . Enraged father Martin Gillingham said his 15-year-old son Jamie, who suffers from dyslexia, was removed from important English and maths lessons and put into a mechanics lesson for two days while the inspectors were at the school. Mr Gillingham, a former soldier, said: 'I'm furious. My son didn't mind that he was moved classes as he does well in motor mechanics as to him that's the easy subject, but obviously the other subjects like English are the ones he struggles in. 'Not only does this give a false impression to Ofsted but my main concern is that he is now missing out on lessons where he needs the extra teaching. 'The reason given to him by the school was that they didn't want to risk that he along with all the others, another five in total, might cause disruption during the visit. 'Their reason is completely unfounded without any justification and purely based on an assumption.' The 46-year-old, who has two other children at the secondary school, said Jamie's autistic classmates were also 'hidden' from the inspectors. Some children were removed from English, maths and science lessons last week as the education watchdog visited . The Royal Military Police veteran fumed: 'I spoke to another parent whose son is autistic and she said she received a call from the school on Wednesday basically saying we think it would be better if he didn't come in as they didn't think her son would be able to cope with an inspector sat at the back of the room. 'They didn't give her an option, they were telling her not asking. She asked if that was allowed and was told it would be an authorised absence.' Writing on Facebook, school governor Russell Hawker accused parents of 'trying to cause trouble for no good reason'. Matravers School Headteacher Dr Simon Riding . 'A small number of very autistic kids were considered to need protecting from the obvious change to routine that would normally occur during the normal full OFSTED inspection,' he said. 'The parents had to be informed so they could decide whether to send their children in. It is sad that some misguided people have stirred a false and grossly misleading story. 'It is quite clear to me that some parents are simply trying to cause trouble for no good reason. The school basically did exactly what other schools do, in the best interests of everyone.' In a statement, the school said: 'Matravers School is proud to be a fully inclusive school that successfully accommodates students with a wide variety of educational needs. 'The school was alerted to some threads of negative comments on local social media sites concerning our support for students during the inspection. As a matter of policy Matravers School does not engage in discussions or comment on social media sites. 'We encourage parents who have any concerns to contact the school so we can respond to their individual queries sensitively and constructively. We thank the vast majority of parents who have supported us through this period. All of our students have represented the school with pride.' Inspectors visited the school on Thursday and Friday last week. Ofsted's last report of the school, in 2013, said: 'Low attainers, students eligible for pupil premium support and most of those identified as disabled or with special educational needs are not making as much progress as their peers.' An Ofsted spokesman said: 'When Ofsted visits a school, inspectors gather evidence about how well individual pupils and particular groups of pupils, such as those with special educational needs, are learning, gaining knowledge, and making progress. 'Ofsted cannot comment on individual complaints.'","Autistic  pupils removed from classes while Ofsted visited, parents say .

"Using a microwave can be tricky. Unless it's a ready-meal, you're forced to hazard a guess about cooking times. Standing in front of the microwave and testing the temperature of a dish over and over can be tedious - and if it's not piping hot in the middle the food can be a health hazard too. But now a solution is in sight. An inventor has designed a next generation  microwave that uses infrared cameras to tell you when your food is irradiated to perfection. Scroll down for video . The innovative invention has an LCD screen that shows you how hot your food is, so you know when to take it out. And it can also send information to your phone, so you can instruct your microwave to cook for longer remotely if needed. The Heat Map Microwave was created by former Nasa engineer Mark Rober. For now the concept is only in a prototype stage, but people can register their interest at the website Better Microwave. In a video showing off the product, he laments the lack of innovation in the microwave since its invention almost 50 years ago. ‘[The microwave] has pretty much remained unchanged since its inception in 1967,’ he said. ‘And that’s a shame, because there are quite a few sucky things about it.’ A US inventor has created a microwave that monitors food temperature (shown). It uses an infrared camera to display temperature data on a screen. The LCD screen on the front shows if your food is ready . The microwave can automatically switch off when the food becomes white hot (shown in animation). It can also send the heat map to your phone so you can monitor your meal . Kitchen chain £34.99 Lakeland has devised a gadget that combines two cooking methods that have transformed family meal times and can deliver a tasty curry or chilli con carne in just 20 minutes. It is a pressure cooker that slides into a microwave and cooks everything from raw meat to jams, marmalades and steam puddings at incredibly high temperatures. The net effect is a super-fast cooking machine that could even replace the supermarket ready meal. He notes that, with current microwaves, it is difficult to know exactly when food is done. ‘Basically, unless you stop the microwave and pull your food out to inspect it, there’s no way to tell if it’s done just right.’ His invention uses an infrared camera in the top of the microwave, and sends information to an LCD screen on the front of the microwave. Here it displays a heat map that starts blue, because the food is cold, and transitions to white hot, when the food is hot. The microwave can also be programmed to turn off when the food it is cooking becomes all white in temperature. And via Bluetooth or Wifi, the heat map can be beamed to your phone, so you can display the same screen on there. From your phone you can then add another 30 seconds if the food doesn’t look like it has cooked enough. The LCD screen can also be used to display recipes or play cooking videos. There's no news yet, though, on when the innovative microwave might be released to the public, or how much it is likely to cost.","A US inventor has created a microwave that monitors food temperature .

"The embattled Oregon Governor has said he will not resign over the fiancee scandal. Kitzhaber is under pressure to resign because of an influence-peddling scandal linked to his fiancee's work as a consultant. Cop cars and reporters continue to swarm outside his house following the rumors he would step down. Oregon State Police provides security for Kitzhaber, but sheriff's Sgt. Bob Ray says the agency requested extra help because of the large media presence after rumors he planned to step down - a rumor the governor said was false yesterday. Surrounded: State and local police patrol outside the home of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber on Thursday . Cop cars and reporters continue to swarm outside his house following the rumors he would step down . Not stepping down: Yesterday the Oregon Governor told reporters he did not plan to resign from office . Scandal: Democrats urged Gov. John Kitzhaber to resign on Thursday amid a growing ethics scandal involving his fiancee Cylvia Hayes accused of using their relationship to land contracts for her business . Ray says troopers wanted to ensure they can freely come and go from the governor's home in southwest Portland. Four sheriff's vehicles are stationed in the area, but Ray says nobody expects any problems. Oregon's top Democrats urged Gov. John Kitzhaber to resign on Thursday, saying he cannot lead the state effectively amid a growing ethics scandal involving his fiancee, a green-energy consultant accused of using their relationship to land contracts for her business. Senate President Peter Courtney said he and House Speaker Tina Kotek asked Kitzhaber, a Democrat who recently started his fourth term, to step down. 'I finally said, 'This has got to stop,' Courtney told reporters after he and Kotek met with the governor. 'I don't know what else to do right now. It seems to be escalating. It seems to be getting worse and worse.' The state treasurer also joined in the call for Kitzhaber to relinquish his office. Strange meeting: Democratic Secretary of State Kate Brown (pictured) said she had a 'strange' and contradictory conversation with Kitzhaber about succeeding him as governor . Urging him to resign: Media gather around Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek as Oregon's top Democrats urged Governor John Kitzhaber to resign on Thursday . 'Unfortunately, the current situation has become untenable, and I cannot imagine any scenario by which things improve,' said Ted Wheeler, another Democrat. 'Oregon deserves a governor who is fully focused on the duties of state.' Their statements came hours after Democratic Secretary of State Kate Brown said she had a 'strange' and contradictory conversation with Kitzhaber about succeeding him as governor. Brown said the governor had asked her to fly back to Oregon from a conference in Washington, D.C., but when she arrived, he asked why she had returned. Scandals: Cylvia Hayes is accused of using her fiance's position to land clients for her business and she has confessed to marrying an immigrant in exchange for $5,000, and buying land for a pot farm . 'This is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation,' Brown said in a statement. She said Kitzhaber told her he's not resigning, but then began a discussion about a transition. Brown would automatically become governor if Kitzhaber steps aside. The governor supposedly told some of his aides he was resigning and summoned Brown from Washington, then changed his mind while she was traveling, according to three people with direct knowledge of the situation. They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about private discussions. Questions about the governor's fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, have swirled for months, but the pressure on Kitzhaber intensified in recent weeks after newspapers raised questions about whether Hayes reported all her income to on her tax returns. Neither the governor nor Hayes, has been charged with any wrongdoing. But earlier this month, Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said she was launching a criminal investigation. The governor issued a vague statement Wednesday explaining he was not resigning. 'I was elected to do a job for the people of this great state, and I intend to continue to do so,' Kitzhaber said. The allegations all arise from his fiancée, who met Kitzhaber in 2002 after enduring a rough-and-tumble life. She told The Oregonian in a 2011 profile that she grew up in a ramshackle house near Seattle and left home at 16, staying with friends until she finished high school. By the time she was 29, she was a twice-divorced graduate student at Evergreen State College. She supported herself in part with the proceeds of an illegal sham marriage to an Ethiopian immigrant in 1997 while plotting with a boyfriend to grow marijuana. Dancing with disaster: Cylvia Hayes, pictured dancing with the Oregon governor John Kitzhaber, apologized last October as she admitted to a sham marriage in the 1990s and buying land on a pot farm . Last year, she acknowledged buying property in rural Washington state for the pot scheme but said the grow effort never materialized. In 1998, while trying to escape a relationship she described as abusive, she went to her boyfriend's house carrying a stun gun. He beat her with it, according to court records. Hayes packed up her belongings and moved to central Oregon, living in a tent on federal land while finishing her thesis, according to the Oregonian profile. She set up an environmental nonprofit and got involved in politics, meeting influential people, and in 2002 was the Democratic nominee for a legislative district in Bend. She met Kitzhaber in the waning days of his second term as governor when he campaigned for her. Hayes lost her race. Kitzhaber left office at the beginning of 2003 and announced days later that he and his wife were divorcing. Later, he and Hayes reconnected, and their relationship became romantic despite a 20-year age difference. Blinded by love?: Asked whether he's been blinded by love, the Oregon governor said he does not believe he is and he said he still plans to marry Cyvlia Hayes . In 2010, after eight years out of office, Kitzhaber made a successful comeback bid and became Oregon's only governor to serve more than two terms. At his side was Hayes, who moved with him to the governor's mansion in Salem. Hayes took an active role in Kitzhaber's administration. She used the title 'first lady,' though the two have never married, and ran public initiatives targeting poverty and hunger. Privately, she was a frequent presence at meetings. Kitzhaber has said he and Hayes took steps to avoid conflicts of interest. A fiercely private person, the governor has been forced to answer embarrassing and personal questions about his relationship. At a news conference last month, he told reporters that he's in love with Hayes, but he's not blinded by it. Meanwhile, the Willamette Week newspaper reported Thursday that Kitzhaber's office last week requested that state officials destroy thousands of records from the governor's personal email accounts. A spokesman for the Department of Administrative Services, which has been handling public-records requests from reporters, said he could not confirm that. But Matt Shelby did say that the agency noticed that emails from Kitzhaber's personal account were among official emails stored on a state server, and the agency told Kitzhaber about it. The governor's office is going through those emails to determine which of them might be considered public records under Oregon law, Shelby said.","Reporters camped outside the home of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber were joined by deputies from the Washington County Sheriff's Office .

"A  woman who allegedly scammed a business out of nearly $100,000 and used it to go on a luxury round-the-world cruise was caught when the ship docked in Australia. Wendy Janine Baulch, from Maryborough, north of Brisbane, appeared at the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday after she was charged with fraud and computer hacking. The 52-year-old allegedly gained access to the unnamed business through a phishing scam email which provided her access to the company's funds. Police said she used the $93,000 she took to pay for a flight to Florida in the United States and a ticket for a luxury cruise from Miami to Sydney. Wendy Baulch, 52, walks out of the police watchhouse with her suitcases in Brisbane on Friday . Baulch had allegedly booked a second leg of the journey and was due to depart from Sydney to Myanmar (Burma) in South-East Asia on February 11. But her international trip was cut short on Tuesday when she was arrested by NSW police as the cruise docked in Sydney - prior to departing on its journey. During her bail application, duty lawyer Howard Posner said the allegations seemed to show Baulch was a minor player in a larger criminal group. Baulch has been accused of scamming a business out of almost $100,000 so she could go on a luxury cruise . Her international trip was cut short  when she was arrested by  police as the cruise docked in Sydney . Magistrate agreed to release her from custody on condition she surrender her passport and report weekly . 'The proposition is that she was a small cog in a large machine and a mule, but that she dipped her fingers into that till more than she should have done,' Mr Posner said. 'It's not that she spent her ill-gotten gains; it's that she stole from the thieves.' She appeared at NSW Local Court before being extradited by Queensland Police Service's Fraud and Cyber Crime Group on Thursday. Police opposed her bail on the grounds she was a flight risk but Magistrate Wendy Cull agreed to release her from custody on condition she surrender her passport and report weekly to police.

"A married policeman has been sacked after meeting a man he met on a gay social media app for sex while on duty. Father-of-two Pc Anthony Taylor was understood to have disabled his police radio so he would not be disturbed during the two hour long sex sessions. The 30-year-old Greater Manchester Police officer twice met the man when he was wearing full uniform and should have been patrolling the streets. Taylor, who had served with the force for 10 years, was dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct. Pc Anthony Taylor, 30, was sacked by Greater Manchester Police after meeting a man for sex while on duty. His dismissal came after a hearing at the force's headquarters, pictured . Taylor met the man for the first time in August after chatting to him via a phone app. On the first occasion he went to the unnamed man's city centre flat after driving out of his division, where he was a member of the Neighbourhood Policing Team. The second time, he picked up the man from the five-star Lowry Hotel in Salford in a marked police car before driving to his flat. On both occasions he was said to have been at the man's home for about two hours. Greater Manchester Police launched an investigation after being alerted to the clandestine meetings. Officers gained access to text messages between Taylor and the man, and found dozens of conversations about the sex sessions which included references to his uniform and handcuffs. They also found images of the officer in his uniform. Taylor admitted to the man that he should have been on duty but used the false name of 'George Smith' when meeting and texting him. A police spokesman confirmed that Taylor had been dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct. He was dismissed on February 10, by Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy following a 90 minute Special Case Hearing held at the force's headquarters the week before. Taylor was said to have picked the man up from the five-star Lowry Hotel in Manchester, pictured, before going to his flat for a sex session . Taylor had been in the force for 10 years and glowing references were given at the hearing. Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said: 'Pc Taylor's actions could have put the public in danger and put undue pressure on his colleagues. 'GMP and the public rightly expect a high standard of professional behaviour from both officers and employees. 'Taylor's conduct while on duty unfortunately fell well below that standard.' One source said: 'The view was that he had grievously harmed the force with his actions. 'I understand the chief constable took the view that the public would have demanded his dismissal. 'It was a complete and utter abuse of his power and position.'","PC Anthony Taylor dismissed after being found guilty of gross misconduct .

"A mother of four says her four children will be able to go to college after she won a third of a historic lottery jackpot. Marie Holmes, 26, from Shallotte, North Carolina, has come forward saying she has one of three winning tickets for the $564.1 million prize, the fifth largest ever in America. The lucky winner said that she scared her kids, one of whom has cerebral palsy, after she found out she had won and began screaming that they 'didn't have to struggle anymore'. She used to work at McDonald's and Walmart before quitting to take care of her children. Scroll down for video . Life changed forever: Marie Holmes, 26, from Shallotte, said that her four children will never have to struggle after she won $188million from the Powerball jackpot . Lucky winner: Ms Holmes said that she scared her children, one of whom has cerebral palsy, when she began screaming that they 'didn't have to struggle anymore'. Bright futures: Ms Holmes said she was happy that she was going to be able to bless her children with luxuries she didn't have . 'They don't have to worry about debt. They can go to college, all on me. And they don't have to worry about nothing,' she said, adding that the money is 'all for them'. Though the winning ticket has not yet been confirmed, the unemployed mother said that she was heading to Raleigh, North Carolina, to speak with lawyers and financial advisers. She will then claim the $188million prize for her ticket, which has not yet been verified by lottery authorities. A spokesman for the North Carolina Education Lottery told the Daily Mail Online that no winning ticket had been presented for the most recent Powerball drawing. The organization generally tells winners to take their time and get advice before coming in and claiming their money. The ticket holders have 180 days to do so. Ms Holmes, who only buys lottery tickets 'when she can', said she was thankful that she could bless her kids with something she didn't have. The mother said that she bought her winning ticket after seeing how large the jackpot had gotten in the recent weeks. Decisions we'd all like to have: Ms Holmes will meet with financial advisers in Raleigh before claiming her winnings and deciding whether to take her money as a lump sum or over time . Lovin' it: The lucky lottery winner used to work at Walmart and McDonald's before she quit to take care of her kids. Above, a McDonald's on Main Street in Shollette, North Carolina. Golden ticket: Ms Holmes's fourth set of numbers purchased, 11-13-25-39-54-19, was the winning combination . She is going to buy a house and set up college funds for her children, though the first thing she is going to do is tithe to the church, according to WECT. When asked whether she was going to splurge on luxury goods like a car, Ms Holmes said 'I'm going to get everything I've ever wanted,' but didn't have any particular items in mind. The Powerball offers two different ways of receiving money for jackpot winners such as Marie Holmes. She will receive financial advice about her options, which include taking a lump sum of $127million or spreading the money out over 30 years. Many lucky ticket holders choose to receive the money in annual payments, which gradually increase over time. Should she choose a lump sum, Ms Holmes's $127million would be subject to 25 per cent federal tax and 5.75 North Carolina state tax. The total amount the mother of four would receive would receive into her account would decrease to around $90million if she took that route. Jackpot winners receive either payments over 29 years or a smaller cash lump sum. It is not clear which option Ms Holmes will choose, though if she chooses the lump sum she will receive $127million before taxes. The federal government will take 25 per cent of the total jackpot, and North Carolina state tax on the winnings is 5.75 per cent. The Scotchman convenience store that sold Ms Holmes her winning ticket has won a $50,000 incentive prize. Ms Holmes said her uncle sold her the winning ticket, but wishes her grandmother was around to see her life change forever. She said that her grandma 'knew all about the struggle and what I was going through'. At least two more Americans are also dozens of millions of dollars richer. Winning tickets were sold in Princeton, Texas and Ponce, Puerto Rico. The numbers of the fifth largest jackpot in U.S. history were revealed at 11 p.m. on Wednesday. The winning numbers for the  $564.1 million jackpot were 11-13-25-39-54. Shopping spree: Ms Holmes said, 'I'm going to get everything I've ever wanted' but she doesn't have any particular big luxuries in mind .

North Texas's Chandra Siwakoti will receive around $1million for selling the winning ticket at his convenience store, though he does not remember anything about the winner. He did not know that he had sold the ticket until media began arriving at his store, according to NBC Dallas For Worth. The numbers of the fifth largest jackpot in U.S. history were revealed at 11 p.m. on Wednesday, with the locations of the winning tickets announced shortly afterwards.

"Incredible journey: Tan Le, CEO of San Francisco bioinformatics firm EMOTIV, started life fleeing squalor in Vietnam for a new life in Australia . Boarding a tugboat in search of a new life, four-year-old Tan Le's mother was clutching one precious possession: a vial of poison. In the highly possible circumstance of a pirate boarding the vessel, she would feed it to her two daughters and her mother, before taking it herself. It was a precaution so many had taken before her as they fled squalor in Vietnam for hope in Australia. Little did they know, as the family huddled together crashing over the China Sea, that one of the little girls would become one of the science world's most successful CEOs with a home in San Francisco. Tan Le is the founder and chief executive of EMOTIV, a bioinformatics company that studies the brain and teaches computers to think for themselves. It is a world, a life, a career she could not have imagined growing up as an Asian outcast in Footscray, a working-class suburb of Melbourne. Speaking to family history enthusiasts at the RootsTech conference in Salt Lake City on Thursday, Le described her ascension from life as an immigrant with nothing - and taunts of 'slit-eye'; graffiti screaming 'go home Asian'. She told the Deseret News her success is thanks to 'humility with daring' - traits she accrued growing up. The journey, both physical and psychological, that she went through with her mother, grandmother, and younger sister gave her the strength and confidence to push boundaries. Describing the start of that journey, aboard the boat, she told a Ted conference: 'I don't remember the pirates who came many times, but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat, or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours. 'But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died, the journey's end too much for him, and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig. No apple has ever tasted the same.' Scroll down for video . Struggles: Le said the hardships of immigration helped her to grow resilient to new challenges in life . At just 16, after intense studying, she was accepted to college. Just a couple of years later she was named 'Young Australian Of The Year.' To get there she obtained grants and scholarships. It sent her into a parallel world. 'In one,' she said, 'I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself. In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.' When she was invited to speak about social activism, Le was more than capable, but petrified. 'I didn't know the protocols. I didn't know how to use the cutlery. I didn't know how to talk about wine. I didn't know how to talk about anything. I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb. 'I told my mother I couldn't do it. She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. No had never been an option. ""Just do it,"" she said, ""and don't be what you're not.""'

"Recalled horror: Rebecca Leyland has spoken of being raped at the age of five by her aunt's boyfriend, school bus driver Frederick Roskell . A mother has spoken of the horrifying childhood ordeal in which she was raped on a school bus at the age of five by her aunt's boyfriend - who threatened to kill her if she exposed him. Rebecca Leyland, now 22, fell victim to bus driver Frederick Roskell - who targeted her on the back seats before taking her to a graveyard and threatening: 'If you tell anyone I'll bury you next to them.' She has bravely decided to share her harrowing story in the hope that more child victims will gain the courage to report their abusers - even years down the line . The dreadful incident left Ms Leyland with lasting mental scars and only after coming forward at the age of 18 and later seeing the 'monster' jailed was she able to move on with her life. She says she was terrified of riding on the school bus for the rest of her time in education and would always opt to walk home to avoid the trauma of reliving the devastating childhood episode. Ms Leyland, of Preston, Lancashire, said she finally built up the courage to report paedophile Roskell after having a child of her own - and deciding she needed to act to prevent other youngsters from being targeted by him. Following her accusations, he was convicted of raping a child under the age of 13 and jailed for 16 years. Ms Leyland, who lived with her mother Sandra, now 45, at the time of the abuse, said Roskell would take the school bus at weekends and drive his girlfriend's family to parks and to the coast. They also visited a local cemetery where they would play hide and seek. But one weekend he let all the children off the bus except Miss Leyland. At just five years old, she had no idea what was about to happen. Recalling the horror, she said: 'The other kids jumped off but he stopped me and held me back. His big, bulky body loomed over me and then he pinned me down. Targeted by paedophile: Ms Leyland (pictured aged four, left),  said Roskell (right) raped her on the back seats of the bus before taking her to a graveyard and threatening to kill her . 'I didn't know what it was at the time. I was only five. But he raped me on the back seats of the school bus. 'I was confused and I didn't know what was happening. I just knew that it hurt and I didn't like it. When it was over I burst into tears.' Afterwards, Miss Leyland asked Roskell: 'Why did you hurt me? I just wanted to play with the others.' 'But he ignored me, and dragged me off the bus and into the cemetery. He took me to two graves and pointed at them. Pointing at his own parents' graves, Roskell told the young girl: 'That's my mum and dad and if you tell anyone what I did I'll bury you next to them.' After this incident, Ms Leyland says the sexual abuse became regular and would happen when no one was around to protect her. She adds: 'I knew what he was doing was wrong, but I was too afraid to tell anyone in case he killed me.' When she was seven Roskell split up with her aunt, who asked not to be named, and Miss Leyland did not see him again. She says: 'I was so thankful that I wouldn't have to endure anymore of his abuse. But what he had done stayed with me. 'As I got older I suffered terrible flashbacks and I refused to get on a bus ever again. I'd hide at school until the school bus left and then I'd walk home. Found courage: Ms Leyland, pictured with her daughter Alexis and boyfriend Anthony, said she finally built up the courage to report paedophile Roskell after having a child of her own . 'I was desperate to tell someone the truth, but I was still terrified that Frederick would hunt me down and kill me.' She suffered depression and anxiety in her early teenage years before finally opening up about the ordeal to her to boyfriend, Anthony, at the age of 15, six months into their relationship. She said: 'He was shocked but he held me as I cried. He convinced me to tell mum. More than a decade had passed and I was worried she wouldn't believe me.' Miss Leyland's mother told her to report Roskell to the police but she refused saying she was still 'too scared to speak up, petrified that people wouldn't believe me and would label me a liar'. She told her mother to forget what had happened and for three years continued to live in fear of meeting her abuser again. In 2011, Miss Leyland gave birth to her daughter Alexis. Years of trauma: After the first incident, Ms Leyland says the sexual abuse became regular and would happen when no one was around to protect her . She continued: 'As soon as I held her I felt an overwhelming rush of love. I knew I couldn't let him abuse any more innocent children.' She went to the police station in Preston and officers took her statement. In her harrowing account, she adds: 'Reliving every detail was awful, it brought back so many painful memories. 'But Frederick had stolen my childhood and my innocence. I wanted him locked up for what he'd done.' She suffered depression and anxiety in her early teenage years before finally opening up about the ordeal to boyfriend, Anthony (pictured together right), at the age of 15 . In 2011 Roskell was arrested but it was not until July 2013 that the case went to court. Frederick Roskell, then 56, of Blackburn, Lancashire, appeared at Preston Crown Court charged with six counts of sexual assault of a child under the age of 13, and rape of a child under 13 – Miss Leyland. He denied the charges but Roskell was found guilty of all the counts which referred to both Ms Leyland and another child. In August 2013 he was jailed for 16 years. 'In court he looked weak and pathetic as he fought to avoid my gaze,' Miss Leyland said. 'In that moment I realised, I was no longer scared of him. He was a monster, who'd taken advantage of an innocent young girl. 'I'm now working to put the past behind me, and I'm focusing on my future. My rapist may have stolen my childhood, but he can't take away my future.' Detective Sergeant Jamie Lillystone, from Lancashire Constabulary, said: 'Although these offences were committed a long time ago, the victims have had to live with the effects ever since. 'This was a particularly complex case because of the historic nature of the offences, the fact that there were multiple victims, and the fact that they were so young at the time. 'That led to difficulties in obtaining detailed, and accurate, accounts from the victims. But the result is a testament to the courage, and strength, of the two victims, and many witnesses. 'It has undoubtedly removed a very dangerous man from the streets of Lancashire.'","Rebecca Leyland raped by aunt's boyfriend, bus driver Frederick Roskell .

"President Obama has called the murders of three Muslim students in North Carolina 'brutal and outrageous' while suggesting they were targeted for 'who they were'. The president released the statement on Friday afternoon, three days after Yusor Mohammad, 21, her husband Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were shot execution-style inside their Chapel Hill home, allegedly by their neighbor Craig Hicks. While police have said the murders followed a long-standing parking dispute between the neighbors, the victims' families and friends have called for it to be investigated as a hate crime. 'No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship,' Obama said in a statement on Friday, suggesting he shares the view. Victims: From left, Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all found with bullet wounds to their heads inside the Chapel Hill apartment on Tuesday . Condolences: President Obama, pictured on Thursday, has released a statement about the killings, calling them 'brutal and outrageous'. The FBI has now launched its own investigation into the deaths . 'Yesterday, the FBI opened an inquiry into the brutal and outrageous murders of Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, Deah Shaddy Barakat, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In addition to the ongoing investigation by local authorities, the FBI is taking steps to determine whether federal laws were violated. 'No one in the United States of America should ever be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, or how they worship. Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims' loved ones. 'As we saw with the overwhelming presence at the funeral of these young Americans, we are all one American family. Whenever anyone is taken from us before their time, we remember how they lived their lives – and the words of one of the victims should inspire the way we live ours. ""Growing up in America has been such a blessing,"" Yusor said recently. ""It doesn’t matter where you come from. There’s so many different people from so many different places, of different backgrounds and religions – but here, we’re all one."" He added that the FBI have now 'opened an inquiry into the brutal and outrageous murders... to determine whether federal laws were violated'. 'Michelle and I offer our condolences to the victims' loved ones,' he said. His comments came after Barakat's brother, Farris Barakat, revealed that Yusor had been so afraid of the neighbor that they had joked about getting her a gun. Speaking to ABC News, Farris Barakat recalled another incident where Hicks had yelled at him for parking in the wrong space while visiting his brother. He said he responded calmly - as did his brother - so that they did not upset Hicks any further. He added that the neighbor had also turned up to his brother's home wearing a gun on his belt, matching other stories shared by friends. But as questions remain over whether the students were targeted over their religion, he said he had never heard Hicks make anti-Muslim remarks towards his brother. Police rushed to the condos in Chapel Hill on Tuesday afternoon after neighbors called 911 to report the sounds of gunshots followed by screams and more gunshots - then silence. A few hours later, 46-year-old Craig Hicks - a married paralegal student and a former car parts salesman - turned himself in to authorities. He has now been transferred from a county jail in Durham, to the state prison in Raleigh because of security concerns, prison authorities said. He is being held without bail. Accused: Craig Hicks, 46, is pictured entering the courtroom for his first appearance at the Durham County Detention Center on Wednesday, after he allegedly shot the three students to death on Tuesday . Mourning: Farris Barakat, pictured at the funeral for his brother Deah Barakat on Thursday, has said his sister-in-law was fearful of her neighbor and joked about getting her own weapon . The killings are fueling outrage among people who blame anti-Muslim rhetoric for hate crimes. Hicks made regular posts on social media slamming religion and its followers, and referring to himself as an 'anti-theist'. On Wednesday, neighbors said he always seemed angry and confrontational, while his ex-wife said he showed 'no compassion at all' for other people. But his wife Karen Hicks insisted that the deaths came after a long-standing parking dispute and said he often championed equality for others. The women's father, Mohammad Abu-Salha, countered that he's convinced it was a hate crime. 'The media here bombards the American citizen with Islamic, Islamic, Islamic terrorism and makes people here scared of us and hate us and want us out. So if somebody has any conflict with you, and they already hate you, you get a bullet in the head,' said Abu-Salha, a psychiatrist. A Muslim advocacy organization also pressed authorities to investigate possible religious bias. Many posted social media updates with the hashtag #MuslimLivesMatter. Demands: At a press conference on Tuesday, Barakat's family called on authorities to investigate it as a hate crime. On Thursday, the FBI announced it had launched its own investigation into the shooting . Side by side: Mohammad Abu-Salha (2nd left), the father of Yusor Abu-Salha and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, stands beside Namee Barakat (center), the father of Yusor's husband, at the funeral on Thursday . Loved: Thousands of mourners attended funerals for the young students in Raleigh on Thursday . 'We understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate-motivated, and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case,' Chapel Hill police Chief Chris Blue said in an email. Chapel Hill Police asked the FBI for help in their probe, and Ripley Rand, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, said his office was monitoring the investigation. On Thursday, as many as five thousand mourners gathered in Raleigh for the funerals of the three victims. The service was held on an athletic field to fit the crowds. 'I call upon the President of the United States, Barack Obama... please involve the FBI. Please investigate,' Mohammad Abu-Salha, the father of Yusor and Razan, pleaded at the service. 'This has hate crime written all over it.' He went on: 'We're not sad. We have peace inside. We are not seeking petty revenge. Our children are much more valuable than any revenge. We care about acknowledging this the way it is.' A charity page set up by Deah Barakat to raise funds for dental care for displaced Syrians has raised more than $310,000. Before his death, its total was just over $20,000.","Obama released a statement about the Chapel Hill shootings on Friday and said that the FBI had launched their own investigation .

"For nearly a decade, the Cassini spacecraft has pulled back the misty veil that obscures Saturn's largest moon, Titan. Its radar has revealed half of the giant moon's surface, highlighting desert-like expanses of sand dunes and vast hydrocarbon seas. Now, using a new technique for cleaning up Cassini's radar images, these views have taken been transformed into high-definition images of its stunning features. Pictured are side-by-side comparisons of a traditional Cassini radar view (left) and one made using a new technique for handling electronic noise that results in clearer views of Titan's surface (right). Show here is Ligeia Mare, one of the large hydrocarbons seas on Titan . The technique, referred to by its developers as 'despeckling,' produces images of Titan's surface that are much clearer. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Titan is of interest to scientists because it is one of the most Earth-like worlds found to date. But trying to analyse its surface has been tricky for scientists because typically, Cassini's radar images have a characteristic grainy appearance. The terrain seen here is in the flow region Leilah Fluctu. With the speckle noise suppressed (right), the overall pattern of bright and dark in the scene becomes more apparent. The left image shows the original photo . This montage of Cassini images of the surface of Titan shows examples of how a newly developed technique for handling noise results in clearer views. The top row of images was produced with the method used since the mission arrived atSaturn a decade ago; the row at bottom was produced using the new technique . A conceptual design of Nasa's submarine that could be heading for Titan in 2040 . If sending rovers to Mars wasn't enough, Nasa now wants to send submarines to Titan. The space agency has outlined plans to launch the huge structure to Saturn's largest moon by 2040. Nasa's conceptual Titan submarine would weigh about one tonne (2,200 lb), and would use conventional electric propulsion over a 90-day mission. Nasa says it plans to send the submarine to Titan using a winged spacecraft similar to US Air Force X-37. The craft would survive hypersonic entry into moon' atmosphere, release the submarine, while its sinks to the bottom of the alien ocean. Titan's atmosphere is largely made up of nitrogen and methane at a pressure one and half times that of Earth's, and with a temperature of -290 °F (-179 °C). Nasa said the submarine would be driven by a 1kW radiothermal Stirling generator that would propel the craft and also prevent it from freezing. Overall, it be able to travel at one metre per second (3.6 km/h, 2.2 mph). This 'speckle noise' can make it difficult to interpret small-scale features or identify changes in images of the same area taken at different times. Despeckling uses an algorithm to remove the noise, resulting in clearer views that can be easier for researchers to interpret. 'Noise in the images gave me headaches,' Antoine Lucas, who works at the astrophysics division of France's nuclear center. Lucas found that a team near Paris was working on a 'de-noising' algorithm, and he began working with them to adapt their model to the Cassini radar data. 'My headaches were gone, and more importantly, we were able to go further in our understanding of Titan's surface using the new technique,' Lucas said. Lucas and colleagues have shown that they can produce 3-D maps, called digital elevation maps, of Titan's surface with greatly improved quality. With clearer views of river channels, lake shorelines and windswept dunes, researchers are also able to perform more precise analyses of processes shaping Titan's surface. And Lucas suspects that the speckle noise itself, when analysed separately, may hold information about properties of the surface and subsurface. 'This new technique provides a fresh look at the data, which helps us better understand the original images,' said Stephen Wall, deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team. With this innovative new tool, we will look for details that help us to distinguish among the different processes that shape Titan's surface,' he said.

"Apple has several hundred employees developing its own electric car at a secret lab, it has been claimed. Speculation was rife last week when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras. 'Dozens of Apple employees, led by experienced managers from its iPhone unit, are researching automotive products at a confidential Silicon Valley location outside the company's Cupertino campus,' the FT claims it was told by sources close to Apple. Scroll down for video . A unnamed Apple employee has hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The email was sent to Business Insider. It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California . Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' It says the Apple research lab was set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away. It is believed Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive is overseeing the lab, and the Bentley owning designer is known to be a car enthusiast. The FT says one of its sources initially believe the project was Apple's in-car entertainment system, known as CarPlay - but now believes it is something more. 'Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay. Today I think it's a car.' The Wall Street Journal says that hundreds of employees are working on the project, codenamed Titan. It says CEO Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago with product design Vice President Steve Zadesky leading the group. His LinkedIn page reveals he was previously an engineer at Ford. 'I love helping to create new product spaces and delivering challenging new technologies,' his biography says. 'At Apple I have been lucky enough to help build and lead the teams for the first iPod, first iPhone, all subsequent iPhones and iPods as well as hundreds of Apple branded accessory products.' Zadesky 'was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company.' 'The project, code-named 'Titan,' has an initial design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan,' its sources claim. Apple also recently hired former Mercedes-Benz R&D head Johann Jungwirth, who joined Apple as a Mac systems engineering leader last fall. A source claiming to be an Apple employee has hinted that the giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The email from the unnamed employee was sent to Business Insider. It described 'vehicle development' at the company but didn't reveal further information. In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range or a self-driving car that would ultimately also rival Google's autonomous project. The cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop self-driving software, for example. The firm is also trying to poach staff from Tesla. Apple is trying very hard to hire engineers away from Tesla Motors, Elon Musk told Bloomberg. The CEO claims that the Cupertino company is gunning hard for his employees, offering them as much as $250K signing bonuses and 60% salary increases. In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software . 'Apple tries very hard to recruit from Tesla,' he said. 'But so far they've actually recruited very few people.' This may seem like a leap for Apple to take, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. Alternatively, the vehicle spotted in California could be a self-driving car. The cameras on the mysterious van could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured) The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. But a video from last year shows a similar car, which later transpired to be an unmarked self-driving Dodge caravan. According to 9to5mac, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. With 12 cameras on top of the car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. 'Too many cameras,' said technology analyst Rob Enderle. 'It has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle.' This would further lend itself to the self-driving car theory. 'Unfortunately for that theory, only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles, and Apple isn't one of them,' said 9to5mac. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) 'This brings us back to a much more likely conclusion: Apple is preparing to take on Google's Street View with a similar offering in its own Maps software.' They said it might feature as part of the iOS 9 upgrade due later this year, although it would likely begin only with select cities such as New York and San Francisco. This would plug a noticeable hole in Apple Maps, which has been missing Street View-style images ever since Apple made it the default maps app for iPhones. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was.","Claims lab is already up and running outside of the firm's Cupertino HQ .

"A 17-year-old girl was excited when she found a pink dress on sale for just £10 on Facebook. But her delight quickly turned to disgust when she took a closer look at the picture - and saw the naked male photographer reflected in the mirror next to the dress. Tilly O'Dell, from Bordesley, West Midlands, said she was so offended she reported the image to the social networking site. Graphic: Tilly O'Dell was shocked when she spotted the naked photographer reflected in the mirror in this photograph, which was posted on Facebook to advertise the vibrant pink dress . The photograph, which was posted on the social networking site, shows the vibrant pink dress hanging against a closed wardrobe door. Next to the dress is a mirror - which captures the reflection of the naked man as he holds up his camera to take the picture. Miss O'Dell, who has a one year old son, said she suspected the Facebook user who posted the image had intended for the naked man to be seen. But when she reported the explicit image to the site, she was told it did not violate any of the site's rules and would not be taken down. She said: 'I asked my Facebook friends ""Share please to get taken down"". It's obvious he put the mirror there so you can see him. It shouldn't be on Facebook because kids go on there as well. 'If you want to put that on there you should have said it was for 18-plus.' Disgusted: Miss O'Dell, pictured, who has a one year old son, said she suspected the Facebook user who posted the image had intended for the naked man to be seen. She reported the image to the website . The picture was defended by one Facebook user, calling himself Andy Mmxv, who posted: 'Congratulations to the square who has reported this photo for nudity. Thanks to the majority who found it funny.' Facebook has since reconsidered, and removed the image.

"The thug who beat a good Samaritan so savagely his own mother thought he was dead was on a court-ordered curfew at the time - but was not wearing his G4S tag. Brian Ramsay, 25, had been fitted with the electronic tag for previous offences and should have been indoors when he carried out the brutal attack on 18-year-old Angus Gallacher. He had been placed on the restriction of liberty order and ordered to stay home between 9pm and 6am. He was due to have the tag removed on October 26 - the same day he battered the teenager to a pulp. Good Samaritan Angus Gallacher (left) had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his eye after an assault by Brian Ramsay (right) 'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher, who spent a week in hospital (pictured). 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was ""I should protect myself as much as I can""... I have no recollection after that' Ramsay cut off the tag himself. Police sources say when he was arrested there was no sign of the tag – and no information to indicate he should have had one. Security firm G4S are supposed to alert the court if any tagged offenders appear to breach a curfew or remove their tag. Police are then supposed to take action against the offender. It is understand that G4S said they immediately informed the court when Ramsay removed the tag and told him to hand it to a local police station. Last night, Conservative chief whip John Lamont told the Daily Record: 'Electronic tagging has its place but there have always been suspicions that it was delivered purely to help empty overcrowded pisons. 'Given that he had previously removed his tag, prison is exactly where Brian Ramsay should have been.' He added: 'It only adds insult to injury to know that his sentence was a mere 18 months. 'Our justice system let Brian Ramsay out on to the streets, it failed to punish him for removing his tag and then when he committed this barbaric attack, it jailed him for less than two years. 'It is shameful.' Appalling: A selfie which the teenager took to show the damage immediately after the beating . The attack happened when Ramsay was walking home from a night out with friends in Gorebridge on October 26 and spotted Mr Gallacher lying on his back in a petrol station forecourt. The young mechanic helped him to his feet, took him to a shop to get some food and then helped him across the road - but then Ramsay unexpectedly turned on him. He subjected Angus to a brutal and sustained assault in the street before dragging him to a nearby house where he attacked him again. Shocked neighbours heard the attack and called police, who found the  teenager lying unconscious in the street. He had 13 skull fractures, three broken fingers, fractured ribs and eardrum damage and needed a titanium plate behind his right eye after the  assault. 'He just turned on me,' said Mr Gallacher. 'My mind went a bit blank and all I thought was ""I should protect myself as much as I can"". 'He must have realised what he had done because he dragged me to his house to get me cleaned up. Then he hit me again in the garden and I have no recollection after that.' The teenager spent a week in hospital, where doctors discovered he had suffered such bad damage to his right eye that he had to have a titanium plate implanted behind his eyebrow. The youngest of three boys, he woke up in a hospital bed disorientated and disfigured. Crime scene: The petrol station where the mechanic said he helped his attacker to his feet on a night out . Afraid: The 18-year-old has been left nervous about leaving his home in Newtongrange, Midlothian . Ramsay was sentenced to just 18 months' jail last week for the brutal attack - and he could be freed in just six. Mr Gallacher's family attacked Ramsay's sentence describing it as 'disgusting' and called for better treatment of victims. Mrs Gallacher said: 'My husband and I are totally shocked and think it's disgusting. 'I don't know the definition of a long time but 18 months doesn't seem to be very long. It's not justice. He was only helping someone and this was his reward.' When police came to their door in the middle of the night, Mrs Gallacher said she thought her son was dead. She added: 'When we were taken to the resuscitation unit where Angus was, my husband couldn't walk through the door. 'He just gripped my arm and said ""My God, what have they done to my boy"". I couldn't recognise him. 'His head was about five times the size it should have been. He was covered in blood. 'The police photographer who came along said she had never seen such damage before in her life. 'That's why we are so upset with what we heard in court.' A petition has been launched calling on the Scottish Government to intervene in the case. It asks that the Government step in to ask the Crown Office to reconsider the charge against Ramsay and upgrade it to attempted murder. A Scottish Courts Service confirmed Ramsay was on a restriction of liberty order when he launched the savage attack on Angus.","Brian Ramsay, 25, beat 18-year-old Angus Gallacher in savage attack .

"Police have interviewed a doctor jailed for 22 years for abusing 18 children with cancer or grave blood disorders and asked him for advice on how to protect children from paedophiles, it was revealed today. In December paediatrician Myles Bradbury, 41, was found guilty of ‘gross and grotesque’ abuse of patients and having a cache of 16,000 indecent images of children at home. Bradbury exploited his job as a respected child doctor to target boys and would abuse them behind screens, sometimes with their parents in the room. Jailed: Doctor Myles Bradbury (left, outside court; and right, in his police mugshot), who abused 18 sick boys, was sent to prison for 22 years. Police have interviewed him to learn about catching paedophiles . But he is now advising police on child protection after authorities visited him in prison to learn how to avoid cases like his own, The Daily Mirror reported. Cambridgeshire Police said the prison visit was 'an attempt to gain further information from Bradbury that might help prevent it in future', adding that 'some information was given'. The revelation he is assisting police comes amid claims Bradbury has more unidentified victims, and while a NHS probe into his crimes at Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital is being conducted. He was arrested in November 2013 only after the grandmother of a victim complained to the hospital. About 800 more families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years he worked for the hospital. But the shocking total includes patients he saw at two other hospitals – in Colchester and Ipswich – where he held outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2013. Police found more than 16,000 indecent images of children on a disc in Bradbury’s home. In one case he filmed the vile abuse. In the wake of his guilty plea, Addenbrooke’s launched a helpline and began contacting the families of all patients he was thought to have dealt with. Gadget: A spy pen used by Bradbury to film some of his victims as he carried out examinations on them . About 800 families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years Bradbury spent working at Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge . Police believe Bradbury targeted the boys – all of whom were ‘really poorly’ and vulnerable – in his private consulting room. Cambridge Crown Court was told that many of Bradbury's victims would be isolated from their parents and asked to remove their clothes before the doctor would grope their genitals. The depth of the examinations were often increased to meet Bradbury's sexual needs, not any medical requirement, the court heard. One said in a statement read to the court: 'I am now anxious to go to the doctor because I don’t know who I should trust. 'I have haemophilia and a pain in my side so I know I should go but I feel disgusted and weird. I didn’t think it would happen to me and I feel angry every time I think about it but also relieved it wasn’t just me but we shouldn’t have to go through it.' Another said he had regular nightmares, felt stressed and lacked confidence. 'I’d like to see Myles Bradbury and ask him why he did what he did to me,' he added. He would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed, before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a ‘legitimate examination’. As he left court after being sentenced, Bradbury said: ‘I’m so sorry’ and refused to answer further questions. Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: ‘This man very cleverly and determinedly created an environment where he not only abused young people, but almost groomed colleagues and parents by being helpful – for example, seeing people outside normal consultancy hours. ‘He would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them. ‘What makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination. I wasn’t a case of “Don’t tell your parents”. He was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination.’ Mr Ridgway said there could be many other victims – including some who don’t even realise they were abused. Sentencing: Judge Gareth Hawkesworth (pictured right in this court sketch) described Bradbury (left) as 'manipulative' and said his actions had undermined the public's trust in the 'overstretched health service'","Paedophile Myles Bradbury, 41, jailed for 22 years for 'grotesque' abuse .

"Tragic: Edward Mallen, pictured, died near his home in Meldreth, Cambridgeshire on Monday . A gifted 18-year-old pupil who had won a place at Cambridge University was killed by a train after suffering a lapse into 'deep depression', his parents said today. Edward Mallen, an accomplished pianist, died near his home in Meldreth, Cambridgeshire, on Monday - just months before he had hoped to start a geography degree at Girton College. His parents said  their 'remarkable' and 'caring' son had recently suffered an 'inexplicable, sudden, brutal and remorseless' decline into depression. The teenager, a student at Hills Road Sixth Form College, Cambridge, had received 12 A*s at GCSE - the best results in 50 years at his school - and was predicted three A* at A level. His mother Suzanne, 46, and father Steve, 49, said their son, the eldest of three teenage siblings, would be deeply missed and appealed for more support for young people with depression. They urged authorities to put more funding into stopping the 'relentless spread' of psychological disorders among teens. In a statement released today, Mr and Mrs Mallen said: 'Edward was a truly remarkable individual whose academic brilliance was matched only by his caring, friendly and warm character. 'Despite intense efforts, Edward's inexplicable, sudden, brutal and remorseless recent decline into a deep depression could not be averted. 'We implore the authorities to reconsider the funding and resources directed towards alleviating the seemingly relentless spread of psychological disorders and anxieties amongst our young people. 'Tragedies like this can and must be avoided.' The family added that they are 'utterly devastated by the sudden and traumatic loss of our lovely son and brother' and the world has been 'measurably diminished' without him. Linda Sinclair, headmistress of Hills Road Sixth Form College,  said she was 'shocked and deeply saddened' by the loss of an 'exceptional young man'.

"First there was the Periodic Table song, then the Cern rap and now the DNA Boogie. A science teacher from the Midlands has developed a rather unorthodox way of teaching his students about biology - through the medium of dance. Dr Richard Spencer, a science teacher at Middlesbrough College, in Teeside, choreographed his lessons to music in an attempt to help his pupils remember how a cell works. Scroll down for more video of Dr Spencer dancing . Among the dances he has created is the DNA Boogie - in which he uses dance moves to represent the molecules chemical structure - and the Meiosis Square Dance, about how chromosomes are shared between cells as tissue grow. Musicians who want to write a chart-topping song need to move in a different musical direction than the pack, research has revealed. More than 25,000 songs on the Billboard 100 from 1958 to 2013 were analysed as part of the study of audio attributes. It found the key to a hit song was that it should sound different from anything else in the charts, but not so distant that it puts music fans off. Adele's number one song Someone Like You, Simon and Garfunkle's Bridge Over Trouble Water, and Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, all hit the top spot because they were distinct from other songs around at the time. Researchers discovered that songs that faltered in the middle of the Billboard 100 were most likely to sound the same, whilst weird singles failed to make the charts at all. Dr Spencer's efforts have earned him a place among ten finalists in line for a $1 million (£650,000) award, the Varkey Foundation Global Teaching Prize. The award is designed to highlight the role teachers play in society. Mr Spencer said he developed the dances along with songs and role-play as a way to help his pupils understand difficult concepts. He said: 'I'm inspired by music, I'm inspired by art. If I can find a biology link, I will bring it into the teaching. 'What I love about teaching is the privilege of working with young people, to fire their passion and reciprocate their energy. 'The opportunity to be creative and think of different ways of communicating science and the buzz of seeing those ""light bulb"" moments when challenging topics start to make sense for students and you realise that hours of planning innovative learning experiences were worthwhile. 'Finally, seeing my students develop in confidence and knowing that I have helped to prepare them for future success, way beyond their time with me in the classroom.' Dr Spencer has also produced detailed step by step guides to his dances to help other teachers use them in their lessons. The Meiosis Square Dance, for example, aims to convey the biological process of cell division, where cells in growing tissue divide into daughter cells with the same genetic material. Richard Spencer has choreographed a dance all about the structure of DNA and the chemicals that make it . Dr Spencer has shared his teaching experiences at an education conference with Pope Frances at the Vatican . In the dance he gives the pupils different coloured bibs to represent chromosomes while they hold curtain ties to represent the centromeres that bind matching pairs of chromosomes together. He also uses different coloured bibs to represent the different chemical building blocks that make up DNA, while also designating different moves to the different parts of each of these nucleotides. For example a fist pump represents the phosphate that sits at the top of each nucleotide, a body wiggle is the sugar and a point towards the floor is the base. It is all performed to the music of Blame it on the Boogie. Dr Spencer takes his pupils through the steps for the DNA Boogie (above) to help them learn about biology . Dr Spencer's teaching (above) has earned him a place among the ten finalists for the Global Teaching Award . Dr Spencer will fly to Dubai for the final award ceremony for the Global Teaching Award on Sunday. The winner will be judged by a panel including Kevin Spacey, Baroness Martha Lane Fox, social activist Geoffrey Canada, Carina Wong, the deputy director of the Bill and Melinda GatesFoundation, and Wendy Kopp, chief executive of Teach for all. Zoe Lewis, principal at Middlesbrough College, said: 'He has fantastic results at A level and AS level. 'But he is not just a good teacher of students but he is a great teacher of teachers. It's that buzz, vibrancy and enthusiasm he has created here that makes him really special.'

"Oregon's new governor will be the first open bisexual to serve as a state's chief executive when Secretary of State Kate Brown steps in for resigning Gov. John Kitzhaber on Friday. The embattled now-former Democratic governor Kitzhaber, 67, has resigned his office amid allegations his fiancee used her relationship with him to enrich herself with contracts for her environmental consulting business. 'I am announcing today that I will resign as Governor of the State of Oregon,' he wrote in a media statement Friday afternoon. In his lengthy statement he admitted that 'I have become a liability to the very institutions and policies to which I have dedicated my career and, indeed, my entire adult life. As a former presiding officer I fully understand the reasons for which I have been asked to resign.' Brown is married to a man but has made no secret about her sexual orientation – and has been embraced for it in one of America's bluest states whose largest city has adopted the slogan 'Keep Portland weird.' Scroll down for video . Oregon Democratic Secretary of State Kate Brown, widely considered to be to the political left of resigning Gov. John Kitzhaber, is the first openly bisexual governor in the nation . Oregon Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber (center) resigned his position on Friday following an influence-peddling scandal involving his fiancee Cylvia Hayes (right) 'I apologize to all those people who gave of their faith, time, energy and resources to elect me to a fourth term last year and who have supported me over the past three decades,' Kitzhaber said o Friday. Brown has had nearly as tumultuous a week as Kitzhaber. On Wednesday she returned home early at Kitzhaber's request from a conference in Washington, D.C., expecting the resignation that would come days later. But when she arrived, the governor told her he had no idea why she was there. 'Late Tuesday afternoon, I received a call from the governor while I was in Washington, D.C., at a secretaries of state conference. He asked me to come back to Oregon as soon as possible to speak with him in person and alone,' Brown said Thursday in a statement. 'I got on a plane yesterday morning and arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. I was escorted directly into a meeting with the governor. It was a brief meeting. He asked me why I came back early from Washington, D.C., which I found strange. I asked him what he wanted to talk about. The governor told me he was not resigning, after which, he began a discussion about transition.' 'This is clearly a bizarre and unprecedented situation,' she said. Brown is the second governor to publicly self-identify along the LGBT spectrum. In 2004 New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey came out as gay in the course of an investigation into a nepotism scandal involving a boyfriend whom he had appointed to a key position. McGreevey resigned three months later. No state has elected an openly gay or bisexual governor. Arizonans chose Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema as the first bisexual member of Congress in 2012. A transgender woman who served 20 years on Navy SEAL teams as a man announced this week that she will run for Congress in Maryland next year. Brown is a native of Minnesota who has described her upbringing in a staunchly Republican family. She studied environmental conservation at the University of Colorado Boulder and earned a law degree from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon. It has been nearly 20 years since she first publicly identified herself as bisexual while a lobbyist for the Women's Rights Coalition. Her 15-year marriage includes two adult children from husband Dan Little's first marriage. Kate Brown (left) is married to a man but has made no secret of her bisexual orientation . Kitzhaber met with his staff late on Friday morning to tell them his plans. Senate Minority Leader Ted Ferrioli, the state's leading Republican lawmaker, said he would not attend the swearing-in of Secretary of State Kate Brown, who will take office as the first openly bisexual governor. She will serve until at least November 2016, when a special election will fill the governor's chair more permanently. 'What should be a day of celebration is turning into a day of reflection and mourning,' Ferrioli told a crowd gathered in the Capitol building in Salem. He said he would 'grieve for the departure in disgrace of one governor and to hope for the healing that can only come if the next governor turns away from policies that put symbolic gestures ahead of the real needs of our citizens.' Oregon;'s top Democrats including House Speaker Tina Kotek urged Kitzhaber to resign amid a growing ethics scandal involving his fiancee, a green-energy consultant accused of using her relationship with the governor to land contracts for her business . Kitzhaber and Hayes face an uncertain legal quandary because of the ethics controversy, which could become a criminal investigation . Kitzhaber attracted horrible national press last year when Oregon's health authorities decided to scrap their chronically buggy Obamacare website after pouring $305 million into the effort to broker medical insurance plans along the model established by the Affordable Care Act. As his march to the political scafford proceeded this week, a report surfaced that had his office asking government agencies to delete all his personal emails. Willamette Week reported that Kitzhaber personal assistant Jan Murdock wrote agency heads with a specific directive that the 'Governor’s office wants anything that is in the email account ... removed from archive.' Influence-peddling is a crime and could put Kitzhaber and Hayes in legal jeopardy. The U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal probe on Feb. 6. In January former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was sentenced to 2 years in prison for using his influence to win research dollars for a supported who lavished him and his wife with money and gifts.","Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown rushed back from a conference in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday to succeed John Kitzhaber, only to be told he was staying .

Uptown, surrounded by tiny dogs and huge blow dries, The Carlyle, a Rosewood Hotel on Madison Avenue is a bastion of New York fashion. The elegant art deco hotel was once a home away from home for JFK and his wife Jackie, O. Princess Diana was a fan, and recently the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge chose to stay in one of the £10,000 a night suites during a charity visit.

The grand NYC dame might be fraying a bit around the edges, but she is still the go-to place for the rich and powerful style set. The sunlit bedrooms are tastefully decked out in creams and Kiehls, mirrored doors and walk-in wardrobes are the perfect backdrop for Outfits Of The Day snaps, and if you're lucky/VIP enough you might get a terrace or at least a view over the city. But it's downstairs, at the beautifully old-fashioned Bemelmans Bar where you will want to spend your time. We nursed a $23 Whisky Smash while feeling like a million dollars as we listened to live jazz (tip: there's no cover charge if you get there before 9.30pm, after that it's $25 pp). 3. STRALA YOGA, Soho . The place to go to - quite literally - strike a pose. Founder (and ex-model) Tara Stiles has been dubbed the coolest yoga instructor ever by Vanity Fair, penned best-selling book Slim Calm Sexy Yoga, and even has a workout to ease champagne hangovers, it doesn't get more fashion than that. 4. THE WYTHE, Brooklyn . The very hip Wythe Hotel hosts many of the best NYFW parties, but once the show has rolled onto London and beyond there are still plenty of reasons to make a beeline for this Brooklyn hotspot. These include: Reynards for brunch (the ground floor restaurant has a whole Daytime Drinking menu and we spotted Charlotte Gainsbourg dining there looking fabulously French), the Ides Bar for sundowners (opens at 2pm, no reservations, get there early) and the rooftop terrace for breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. The ground floor restaurant at the Wythe Hotel in Brooklyn has a whole Daytime Drinking menu . 5. SOUL CYCLE, three locations including Tribeca, Noho and Union Square . The bad news is that you're going to have to work for your posing opp at this studio. The good news is that you'll get buns of steel as a result. Just ask Karli Kloss and her Victoria's Secret crew who are mega fans of this cult-like spinning class which offers a special $20 (£16) rate for a first time riders. Wheels of fury: Hard work, but a few sessions at Soul Cycle should tone up those flabby bits . 6. SURF SATURDAYS, Soho . When is a coffee shop not a coffee shop? When it's a surf shack meets art gallery meets coffee shop, that's when. The flat whites are awesome, the denim's cool, there's a terrace for people watching, and a surf-loving barista is surely one of the best photo props there is… what's not to love? 7. CITY BAKERY, Union Square . Unlike Soul Cycle, the City Bakery does not promise buns of steel. It does, however, promise the 'city's best hot chocolate' and even better they serve up NY's latest baking craze – the pretzel croissant – to dunk in it. Cronut who? Treat time: A pretzel croissant and hot chocolate from the City Bakery on Union Square . 8.THE LUDLOW BAR, Lower East Side . After Brooklyn, the next most hipster hangout area is the Lower East Side where The Ludlow manages to combine slouchy sofas and beardy crews with smiley service and excellent margaritas. Tip: wear an interesting hat if you wanted to be speedily seated (worked for me). 9. ORGANIC AVENUE, Bryant Park . Juice shops are almost as prevalent as Starbucks in Manhattan now and you're nobody at Fashion Week until you have Instagrammed a picture of your shoes and a Matcha Chia Glo next to the Bryant Park tents.","Sup divine cocktails in Kate & Wills' favourite Madison Avenue bar .

"The western US will face increasingly severe mega-droughts later this century if no action is taken to curb climate change, researchers have warned. They say that 'unprecedented drought conditions' - the worst in more than 1,000 years - are likely to come to the Southwest and Central Plains after 2050 and persist because of global warming. It is the first study to predict that the coming intense dry spells could exceed the decades-long mega-droughts that occurred centuries ago and are blamed for the demise of certain civilisations in the late 13th century. Researchers say the current mega-drought in the US is going to get worse. They say there will be more and more droughts starting in 2050. And there's an 80% chance one could last at least 35 years. Pictured is a warning buoy sitting on the dry, cracked bed of Lake Mendocino near Ukiah, California . 'Nearly every year is going to be dry toward the end of the 21st century compared to what we think of as normal conditions now,' said study lead author Dr Benjamin Cook, a Nasa atmospheric scientist. 'We're going to have to think about a much drier future in western North America.' According to the study, published in the journal Science Advances, there is a more than 80 per cent chance that much of central and the western US will have a mega-drought lasting at least 35 years later this century. 'Water in the Southwest is going to become more precious than it already is,' said study co-author Dr Toby Ault of Cornell University . Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries. These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming . And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. 'I was honestly surprised at just how dry the future is likely to be.' 'I look at these future mega-droughts like a slow moving natural disaster. We have to put mega-droughts into the same category as other natural disasters that can be dealt with through risk management.' The study is based on the current increasing rate of rising emissions of carbon dioxide and complex simulations run by 17 different computer models, which generally agreed on the outcome, according to the researchers. The regions looked at include California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, northern Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, most of Iowa, southern Minnesota, western Missouri, western Arkansas, and northwestern Louisiana. Looking back in records trapped in tree ring and other data, there were mega-droughts in the Southwest and Central Plains in the 1100s and 1200s that lasted several decades, but these future ones will be worse, Dr Cook said. Those were natural and not caused by climate change, unlike those forecast for the future. 'Natural droughts like the 1930s Dust Bowl and the current drought in the Southwest have historically lasted maybe a decade or a little less,' said Dr Cook. 'What these results are saying is we're going to get a drought similar to those events, but it is probably going to last at least 30 to 35 years.' Because of changes in the climate, the Southwest will see less rain. But for both regions the biggest problem will be the heat, which will increase evaporation and dry out the soil. The result is a vicious cycle: The air grows even drier, and hotter, Dr Cook said. Nasa scientists used tree rings to understand past droughts and climate models incorporating soil moisture data to estimate future drought risk in the 21st century (shown) 'We're going to have to think about a much drier future in western North America,' said study lead author Dr Cook from Nasa. Pictured, a woman looks at a pier once surrounded by the waters of Lake Buchanan on 12 March 2014 in Burnet, Texas . Scientists had already figured that climate change would increase the odds of worse droughts in the future, but this study makes it look worse and adds to a chorus of strong research, said Dr Jonathan Overpeck, co-director of the Institute of the Environment at the University of Arizona. 'These results are not surprising, but are eye-opening nonetheless,' said Dr Overpeck, who wasn't part of the research. The risks and dangers are worse today because of the larger population and greater dependence on water resources, scientists warned. 'We are the first to do this kind of quantitative comparison between the projections and the distant past, and the story is a bit bleak,' said Dr Jason Smerdon, a co-author and climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, part of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. 'Even when selecting for the worst mega-drought-dominated period, the 21st century projections make the [previous] mega-droughts seem like quaint walks through the Garden of Eden.' Shown is a representation of the summer moisture in the US Central Plains and Southwest. The brown line represents the variation in dryness since the year 1000; the lower the line on the graph, the drier the conditions. Coloured lines to the right side of the graph represent what climate models see ahead . Currently the western United States has been experiencing a drought for about 11 of the past 14 years (stock image shown). The risks and dangers are worse today because of the larger population and greater dependence on water resources, scientists warned . Researchers also projected a continued rise in emissions of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, and looked at a scenario in which actions were taken to cut back on greenhouse gases resulting in lower emissions. Both approaches raised concern for the future. 'The results... are extremely unfavourable for the continuation of agricultural and water resource management as they are currently practiced in the Great Plains and southwestern United States,' said Dr David Stahle, professor in the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arkansas, who was not involved in the study. Currently the western United States has been experiencing a drought for about 11 of the past 14 years. The dry area spans California, Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma and other parts of the region, directly affecting more than 64 million people.","Researchers say mega-droughts in the US are going to get worse .

"Members of Congress have lashed out against the U.S. Secret Service after an investigation showed that the elite agency spent an average of just 25 minutes on training for each of its officers in 2013, a situation investigators called 'unacceptable' Officers in other law enforcement agencies spent up to one-fourth of their on-the-job time in training during the same year. In previous years the Secret Service had sent special agents through as many as eight training classes. But between 2012 and 2013, it offered just one. 'We all are in agreement the levels are unacceptably low,' said Danielle Gray, one of the investigators who testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform committee. Members of the Secret Service Protective Mission Panel (L-R) Mark Filip, Danielle Gray, Thomas Perrelli and Joseph Hagin told members of Congress the elite agency is in disarray and can't train its agents appropriately . Joseph Clancy, the aegncy's acting director, is favored by the Whte House to keep his job permanently even as investigators recommend an outsider to reform the Secret Service . Panelists said the Secret Service is in need of more outside leadership, while President Barack Obama is hinting that he wants acting director Joseph P. Clancy to keep the job personally. Clancy is the ultimate insider, with a resume that includes several years at the helm of the agency's presidential protection division until his retirement in 2011. He was appointed to fill a vacancy at the top of the agency's pyramid when Julia Pierson resigned last year, following a series of embarrassing security lapses. GovExec reported that the investigation concluded with recommendations to add new personnel to correct the training deficit – 200 new uniformed officers and 85 new special agents. One panelist said those new hires might be just a 'down payment' on a larger hiring binge. but Republicans on the committee doubt more spending will right the ship. The Secret Service already employs 6,300 people and Congress has over-funded it during the last two years, providing more money than it asked for. The newly formed U.S. Secret Service Protective Mission Panel first met after a fence jumper managed to enter the White House and an armed gunman fired shots at the presidential mansion – with agents going four days before they realized a bullet had broken an upstairs window. Panelists said the Secret Service should clean house and install all new management. This week the second-in-command Alvin 'A.T.' Smith transferred to a job in the Homeland Security Investigations division. 'No organization is perfect,' said Mark Filip, one of the panelists. 'It's not a weakness to acknowledge there are problems. Accept them and move forward.' Questions of morale and overworked agents have arisen in the course of the investigation, according to those who testified on Thursday. But Democrats were angry and Republicans were unsympathetic, GovExec reported. REALLY? One Republican blasted agents for complaining about their jobs, pointing to Hollywood representations of the Secret Service like those in the new film 'Kingsman' for guidance . 'This is not just any organization,' said New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney. 'This is U.S. Secret Service. It used to be one of the most respected agencies in our government.' NO EXIT: Secret Service Deputy Director Alvin 'A.T.' Smith resigned this week, only to pop up in a mysterious appointment to a job with Homeland Security Investigations . 'I'm sure they're all nice people,' Tennessee Rep. John Duncan chimed in, 'but they have to realize they are very lucky to have their jobs.' And agents in federal law enforcement are also paid more than their counterparts in local police forces, he said, who 'are out there fighting the real crime, the daily, day-to-day crime that everyone wants fought.' 'When I hear about low morale in the Secret Service, they ought to be ashamed,' he carped. Georgia Republican Rep. Buddy Carter said it was hard to imagine a low-morale Secret Service, given the agency's pop culture image. 'Did these guys not watch the movies?' he asked. 'Those people are really excited about becoming Secret Service agents.' Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and ranking Democrat Gerry Connolly of Virginia said they are considering a plan to pare down the agency's portfolio by taking away its mission of stopping counterfeiting, one of its earliest historical functions. A fence-jumper with a pocket knife managed to get inside the White House last year, starting a cascade of scandals that led to the resignation of the agency's first female chief, Julia Pierson .","Review board examined the agency's performance after a fence-jumper managed to get into the White House and a gunman shot out a window .

"New York Times media columnist David Carr has died at age 58 after collapsing in the Times newsroom. The father of three wrote the Media Equation column for the Times, focusing on issues of media in relation to business and culture. Just hours before his death, the veteran newsman tweeted about the death of his fellow journalist Bob Simon. 'RIP Bob Simon, a television storyteller without peer,' Carr wrote Wednesday. Scroll down for video . New York Times columnist David Carr died Thursday after collapsing in the newsroom. Just hours before, the 58-year-old had participated in a TimesTalk with speakers including Ed Snowden . And just hours before news of his death broke Thursday evening, Carr participated in a TimesTalk, featuring Ed Snowden, among others. It's no surprise then that Carr's death came as a shock to so many. Initial reports, the New York Times' included, said Carr died in the newsroom. The Times' website now says Carr collapsed in the newsroom and later died at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital. The cause of death was not immediately known. Carr is survived by wife Jill Rooney Carr, an event planner with whom he lived in Montclair, New Jersey with their daughter Maddie. He also has twin daughters, Erin and Meagan. He joined the Times in 2002 as a business reporter, covering magazine publishing. His Media Equation column appeared in the Monday business section. Before joining the Times, Carr was a contributing writer for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. He also was a media writer for news website Inside.com. Carr served as editor of the Washington City Paper, an alternative weekly in Washington, D.C. He also was editor of a Minneapolis-based alternative weekly called Twin Cities Reader. Carr (at left on Thursday before his sudden death) well known for writing about his personal life and penned a memoir in 2008 The Night of the Gun in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction . Carr tweeted about the death of his fellow journalist Bob Simon just hours before his own death . Carr was well known for writing about his personal life and penned a memoir in 2008 The Night of the Gun in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction. The book, published by Simon and Schuster, traces Carr's rise from cocaine addict to single dad raising twin girls to sobered-up media columnist for the Times. Carr said he wrote up a book proposal 'on a dare to myself' in two days. After an agent sold the idea, Carr ended up interviewing about 60 people and working on the book for three years. He took the transcribed interviews, numerous documents and pictures to his family's cabin in the Adirondacks, where he wrote the book. Last year, Carr began teaching a Boston University class that explored the creative business models to support digital journalism. It was among the first professorships dedicated to evaluating how media organizations can sustain themselves financially as readers and advertisers migrate to digital platforms, a crisis that has doomed some news organizations and threatens the viability of others. Carr had written about the issue extensively. 'I think a lot of journalism education that is going on is broadly not preparing kids for the world that they are stepping into,' Carr told The Boston Globe.","Carr had been tweeting just hours prior to his death, including a post about his fellow journalist Bob Simon, who died Wednesday .

"Public Health England is urging parents, schools and doctors to look out for the signs of scarlet fever, which causes a red, sandpaper-like rash . Parents have been warned to look out for the signs of the highly contagious scarlet fever, following a 'steep rise' in cases. Public Health England (PHE) said 1,265 new cases were reported in the first six weeks of 2015. Last week alone saw 300 new cases recorded across the country. It comes before the 'high season' in March and April when experts expect to see the highest number of cases. NHS officials warn the condition typically infects between 2,000 and 4,000 cases. But more than 14,000 cases were reported in England last year - the highest since the 1960s. PHE said the rise this year is 'above what is typical for this time of the year', and advised schools, nurseries and parents to be vigilant to the signs. They urged people to let local health protection teams know as soon as possible, if they fear children are infected. The bacterial illness is characterised by a distinctive pink, red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch. Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance, said: 'The first symptoms of scarlet fever include a sore throat and fever, which may be accompanied by a headache, nausea and vomiting. 'Between 12 to 48 hours after this, a characteristic fine, sandpapery rash develops, often appearing first on the chest or stomach. 'Individuals who think they or their child may have scarlet fever should consult their GP.' She added: 'As we enter into high season for scarlet fever, we ask GPs and other front line medical staff to be mindful of the current high level of activity when assessing patients. 'Prompt notification of cases to local health protection teams is critical to enable local monitoring and rapid response to outbreaks. Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that causes a distinctive pink-red rash. It typically starts in one area of the body, but soon spreads to many parts, including the ears, neck and chest. The rash can be itchy and feels like sandpaper to touch. Other symptoms include a high temperature, flushed face and a red, swollen tongue. The first symptoms often develop two to five days after infection, although a sufferer will already be contagious before showing signs of the illness. Scarlet fever is often triggered by a sore throat or skin infection, such as impetigo, which are caused by particular strainsof streptococcus bacteria. 'Schools and nurseries should similarly be mindful of the current elevated levels of scarlet fever and promptly inform local health protection teams at an early stage if they become aware of cases, especially if more than one child is affected.' She said symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases 'remain reasonably mild' providing antibiotics are taken. Dr Lamagni advised anyone who fears they or any family member has scarlet fever to stay at home until at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment. Scarlet fever is mainly a childhood disease and is most common between the ages of two and eight. It was once a very dangerous infection but is now less threatening, although complications can happen especially if sufferers do not get treated. The first sign of the bacterial infection, which commonly affects children aged two to eight, is often a fever. In the first six weeks of this year health bosses have recorded 1,265 cases - higher than average (file picture)","In first six weeks of 2015, 1,265 cases of scarlet fever recorded in England .

"Guilty: Jason Cotterill, outside court today, used more than 60 different Facebook profiles to send 'disgusting' messages to his ex-girlfriend, her family and her friends after she ended their relationship . A 42-year-old man sent an explicit photo of his former lover to her daughter as part of a campaign of harassment after she ended their relationship. Jason Cotterill  used more than 60 different Facebook profiles to send 'disgusting' messages and 'revenge porn' to his ex-girlfriend, her family and her friends after she blocked him on the social networking site. He also threatened to share pornographic video content of the woman  after he found it online. Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, was found guilty of harassment at Birmingham Magistrates' Court today. Cotterill and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013, Birmingham Magistrates' Court was told. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. Shortly afterwards the woman ended the relationship, but Cotterill refused to accept her decision. During the trial the woman said having sex with Cotterill had been a 'mistake'. She told the court he set up more than 60 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked and 'unfriended' him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim, who used to be a sex worker, said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' He also sent a message which said: 'Why don't you play no more? Might send the photo to your sis.' Prosecutor Rukhsana Mohammed told Cotterill: 'You felt anger because you wanted to maintain the relationship and she didn't want it. 'After she cut you off by changing her number you created fake Facebook profiles about 60 times to get through to her. 'You wanted to embarrass her so searched the Internet for material, the video was found by you.' 'Honourable': Cotterill, from Oldbury, West Midlands, said he sent the woman the explicit video because he wanted to 'warn her'. He was found guilty of harassment at Birmingham Magistrates' Court, pictured, today . Giving evidence today, Cotterill admitted sending the woman the video, but claimed it was because he wanted to 'warn her' it was on the internet. He said: 'I sent her it because she was an old friend and I wanted to warn her.' Mr Houldcroft, defending, said: 'Mr Cotterill had good and honourable intentions, he wanted to warn the complainant.' District Judge David Robinson dismissed the claim saying: 'I believe she was harassed in October and November last year. 'If the defendant was acting out of good will I would find it extraordinary and if he used his account a lot then how was he not aware of other messages sent from it.' Cotterill was bailed and ordered to return to court for sentencing on March 6. Luke King was jailed for posting an explicit image . Those convicted of revenge porn – the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress – could face two years in prison under new laws. It will be made a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill, which is currently going through Parliament. It will mean that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter will be caught by the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message. Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies will also be caught. Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet. Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images. The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions. However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal – but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages. Last year, Luke King, 21, of Nottingham, became the first person to be jailed for revenge porn offences in the UK. After his three-year relationship ended he posted a number of explicit images of his former partner, and changed his WhatsApp icon to one of the images. King was eventually prosecuted under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 after he ignored two police warnings not to share the X-rated images and was jailed for 12 weeks.","Jason Cotterill met up for three dates with 42-year-old woman in 2013 .

"In 3,800BC a young couple were buried together in a final embrace that was hoped to keep them together for all eternity. Now the remains of the man and woman - who are said to have died in their twenties - have been uncovered in the Diros Caves in the Peloponnese region of Greece. An archaeologist leading the excavation of the ‘underworld’ cavern described the find as ‘stunning’ and said it is possibly the oldest grave ever found in the country. Scroll down for video .

The remains were initially unearthed in 2013 and have now been analysed using radiocarbon dating. The results of the analysis showed the bones belonged to a man and a woman, both aged between 20 and 25, dating back almost 6,000 years. The cavern is known as Alepotrypa - or 'foxhole' - and was found in the 1950s. During the 1970s archaeologists, led by Giorgos Papathanassopoulos, began excavating the site. Experts believe hundreds of people lived inside Alepotrypa before the entrance collapsed burying everyone alive 5,000 years ago.

It has previously been linked with sparking myths about the Greek underworld god Hades, and has been referred to as the 'Hell' caves . It has previously been linked with myths about the Greek underworld god Hades. In Greek legend, Hades was the King of the Underworld, - a hidden kingdom of the dead, also referred to as Hell. The underworld is said to be surrounded by a series of rivers. This included The Acheron, (river of woe), The Cocytus (river of lamentation), The Phlegethon (river of fire), The Styx (river of unbreakable oath by which the gods swear), and The Lethe (river of forgetfulness). Once across the rivers an adamantine gate, guarded by Cerberus, forms the entrance to the kingdom. He was said to be a greedy god and presided over funeral rites and defended the right of the dead to due burial. Over the years, archaeologists have found tools, pottery, silver and copper artefacts in the cave said to date back to the Neolithic Age. The cave was also used as a cemetery and for burial rituals, and this in particular led researchers to believe it inspired the legend of Hades' underworld.

"It's a new theory that could shatter everything you thought you knew about The Simpsons. Die-hard fans of the satirical cartoon have proposed that Homer Simpson never awoke from a coma he fell into during an episode in 1993 and that everything that occurred on the series after that happened inside Homer's head. While seeming outlandish on the surface, the theory is gaining a lot of traction in online The Simpsons forums, with even the most devout of followers declaring they believe it. The theory lays claim to why the characters never age, and how the show moved from mundane episodes in the early 90s, such as Bart cheating on an IQ test, to plots that saw Mr. Burns capturing the Loch Ness Monster. Scroll down for video . Oh hey: In the 1992 episode Homer the Heretic, Mr Simpson has a conversation with God, who tells him he will die in six months time . The concept was put forward by Reddit user Hardtopickaname, who proposes the arc starts in the 1992 episode 'Homer the Heretic'. In it, Homer ponders the meaning of life during a conversation with God. He insists he can't wait until he's dead to find out, to which God says: 'You can't wait six months?' Six months later, in April 1993 episode 'So It’s Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show', Homer is crushed by a vending machine after an April Fool's prank by Bart goes wrong. He is taken to hospital in a coma. Comatose: Homer ends up in hospital in an April 1993 episode after one of Bart's pranks goes awry . Theory: Every episode since this one is a dream from inside Homer's head . Watch full explanation of the theory . At the end of the episode, Homer abruptly awakes from the coma, strangling Bart, and then the credits roll. 'I propose that Homer didn’t actually wake up from his coma. He is still in a vegetative state and every single Simpsons episode afterwards is in Homer’s imagination,' the Reddit user theorizes. 'Homer remembers Bart, Lisa, and Maggie as 10, 8, and 1 year old, so they will always appear that way in his dreams.' The theory claims the show, which started simply as a tongue-in-cheek portrayal of middle-class America, became radically different from 1993. There was Homer going into space, a look-into-the-future where Lisa was President, and an episode devoted almost entirely to Moe's 100-year-old bar rag, which turns out to be his best friend. Outlandish: The theory claims the show became more 'zany' after the coma episode in 1993, with episodes such as Homer going into space . It also claims to show how a never-ending stream of celebrities came to come in contact with the Simpsons over the years. This is clearly Homer’s imagination running wild. 'With no real world restrictions, Homer’s mind is able to dream up scenarios of him and his family in fantasies involving him winning a Grammy, his father fighting his boss for buried WW2 treasure, his wife getting breast implants, his infant daughter saving him from drowning, etc.' Creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, who is typically quite vocal about his show, is yet to comment on the theory, The Huffington Post reported.","Theory claims Homer never awoke from a coma he fell into in April 1993 .

"A promising university student fractured a 19-year-old's skull with a single punch after the victim asked him if he had a cigarette lighter in a McDonald's restaurant, a court heard. Caine Inyanga, 19, was spared jail after he floored Adam Turner in the violent early morning attack that left the tool maker unconscious on the ground. Turner, also aged 19, approached Inyanga in the early hours of the morning in McDonald's in Middlesbrough, Teesside, and asked if he had a cigarette lighter. Caine Inyanga, 19, pictured left, was spared jail after he admitted fracturing the skull of Adam Turner, pictured right, with a single punch . After receiving no response from the chemical engineering student the victim turned to Inyanga's female companion and asked the same question. Inyanga, who had been drinking and taking drugs, demanded Mr Turner and his friend 'get outside now,' said prosecutor Emma Atkinson. The pair made it clear they did not want to fight, but he punched both of them, Teesside Crown Court heard. The blow to Mr Turner caused him to fall to the floor and he lost consciousness. As a result of the attack he has suffered hearing lose and tinnitus. Inyanga ran away from the fast food restaurant on October 10 last year, but later handed himself in. When police examined his phone they found text messages which contained the phrase 'battered for rudely interrupting'. He told officers he was offended when the two men 'came a bit too close' and Mr Turner was quoted as saying: 'It's a free country.' The attack happened at McDonald's in Middlesbrough, Teesside, after Mr Turner had approached Inyanga and asked him if he had a cigarette lighter . Inyanga, who had no previous convictions, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and common assault. Scott Taylor, defending, said: 'Nothing could have been said that would have provoked the action that happened. 'He has shown remorse. He asked that I pass on his sincere apologies to both individuals.' Judge Howard Crowson said: 'This is the tragedy of it. These are both placid men, neither of them violent. 'You probably never intended any such harm, not that level,' he added. Inyanga of Middlesbrough, was sentenced to 16 months in prison, suspended for 18 months. He was also made the subject of a four-month tagged curfew, ordered to complete 150 hours' unpaid work and a pay £1,000 compensation. Speaking after the hearing Mr Turner from Hartlepoole said: 'I think the sentence is probably better than him going to actual prison. Promising university student, Inyanga, was handed a suspended prison sentence after he admitted the attack . 'It still affects me quite a lot, in every way really. Being a tool-maker, sound is part of my job as well. 'It's got a lot better since hospital. It's still not the same as it was.' He said he remembered little of the assault: 'I don't go out to fight. I just go out to have a good time. I'd rather hug someone than fight them. 'I woke up in hospital getting told I was attacked. It left me wondering why. I was very confused. 'I remember waking up strapped down to a table with this horrible thing around my head, X-raying me. That petrified me. 'I woke up in the trauma ward and I was alone, just bawling my eyes out.'","Caine Inyanga, 19, admitted grievous bodily harm and common assault .

"The Archbishop of Canterbury issued an extraordinary apology for the British bombing of Dresden during the Second World War . The Archbishop of Canterbury last night issued an extraordinary apology for the British bombing of Dresden during the Second World War. In what was immediately criticised as an insult to the young men who gave their lives to defeat the Nazis, the Most Rev Justin Welby told the German people of his ‘profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow’ over the attack. His comments at a ceremony in Dresden to mark the 70th anniversary of the bombings came amid a growing row about BBC coverage of the commemoration in which Britain was described as ‘worse than the Nazis’ over the raids that killed thousands at the end of the war. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth criticised the Archbishop, saying: ‘I do not hear Angela Merkel apologising for the Blitz.’ And historian Professor Anthony Glees said it was wrong to take a single incident in the war and say sorry for it. Archbishop Welby said the bombing of Dresden, which killed an estimated 25,000, ‘diminished all our humanity’. But he made no reference to the 55,573 British aircrew killed in the struggle to overthrow Hitler, nor to the German bombing of London and Coventry. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘These remarks do sound to me like an apology. For the Archbishop to make an apology for our defeat of Hitler is bizarre. I would have thought the last thing we should be doing is apologising. We should be praised for defeating Hitler. These words are an insult to the young men who gave their lives in the defeat of Germany.’ The Archbishop – whose great uncle Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal was one of the main architects of Britain’s campaign of bombing German cities – told the congregation he thought it was ‘miraculous’ that they were welcoming him given the ‘brutal and devastating’ nature of the attack. ‘Over three days in February allied bombers brought death and destruction on a scale and with a ferocity it is impossible to imagine,’ he said. ‘Much debate surrounds this most controversial raid of the allied bombing campaign. Whatever the arguments, events here 70 years ago left a deep wound and diminished all our humanity. So as a follower of Jesus I stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow.’ Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the bombing raids on Dresden (pictured), which killed an estimated 25,000, ‘diminished all our humanity’ Most Rev Justin Welby apologised for Dresden (pictured), but made no reference to the German bombings of London and Coventry . He praised the reconciliation of Europe and the growth of friendship after the war. The references to profound regret and deep sorrow sparked furore among veterans and Conservative politicians already angered by BBC news reports on the anniversary dominated by graphic accounts of the deaths of German victims. An interview with a British prisoner of war – who called the bombing of Dresden a ‘war crime’ – was repeated several times. Sir Gerald, a Tory MP, said: ‘Our wartime military commanders, Winston Churchill, and the men of Bomber Command should not be held to blame for the deaths of civilians such as those in Dresden. ‘That was the fault of the German people who failed to remove Hitler and his evil regime. It is very unfortunate that the Archbishop felt unable to pay tribute to the heroism of the young men of Bomber Command, half of whom gave their lives so that the German people could ultimately be liberated from Hitler’s tyranny.’ The Archbishop was criticised by historians and former defence secretary Sir Gerald Howarth for the apology for the bombings of Dresden (pictured) The Archbishop said it was ‘miraculous’ Dresden  (aftermath of bombing pictured) was welcoming him given the ‘brutal and devastating’ nature of the attack . Justin Welby's comments came at a ceremony in Dresden to mark the 70th anniversary of the bombings . Professor Glees, of Buckingham University, said: ‘Britain did not want to fight that war. ‘But once it began we were determined to win it, knowing that civilian lives would be taken. Most people are satisfied that the RAF bombing campaign was not motivated by vindictiveness but was part of a strategy to bring the war to a close as quickly as possible. ‘Winston Churchill thought the bombing of Dresden had gone too far. But he would never have apologised for it, never.’ Of the BBC coverage, military top brass, RAF veterans, politicians and historians said it ignored the atrocities committed by Hitler and the military justifications for the attack. Sir Gerald said that the one-sided reporting of the raid was disgraceful. He said: ‘It is very unfortunate that the BBC chose on all days to produce such a one-sided account. ‘It was just as one might expect from the BBC, concentrating on the negatives. What about the civilians in London who were bombed out of their homes? What about the bombing in the Blitz? ‘To suggest that those responsible for the bombing of Dresden were on a par with Hitler or guilty of war crimes is an absolute disgrace.’ A church of England spokesman pointed to interviews following the Archbishop’s speech in which he had ‘refused to say he was apologising’. The spokesman said: ‘Any suggestion that the Archbishop was apologising is manifestly false. The Archbishop’s comments were a reflection in a solemn ceremony on the tragedy of war. ‘They very carefully avoided apologising, and those present, including the President of Germany, recognised the difference. In his speech, he also recognised the fact that there is no equivalence with Nazi war crimes and that the war started with Nazi aggression. ‘In broadcast interviews immediately following his speech the Archbishop refused to say he was apologising, but repeated that war is always tragedy. He also referred to the terrible losses in Bomber command. Mr Welby said it was not a question of blame and spoke of the bombing of Coventry, Liverpool, London and other places.’","Justin Welby apologises for British bombing of Dresden in World War II .

"Valentine’s Day is a day away, but for those looking to find a date, how can you tell if someone is interested? Well, fortunately, researchers have worked out the science of flirting, to find out what people do most often if they are attracted in another person. And the results are in: Starting off being encouraging and complimentary, and ending by being expressive and using open palm gestures, is a sure-fire way that someone is interested. Scroll down for video . A University of Kansas study looked at the science of flirting (stock image shown). 102 men and women took part in a study to find what people did when they were attracted to a member of the opposite sex. The results show that people were encouraging and complimentary - at first . The research was led by associate professor of communication studies Dr Jeffrey Hall  from the University of Kansas. His team gathered 102 heterosexual men and women - split 50:50 - who had never met before, partnered them up in conversations for 10 to 12 minutes and recorded them on video. Afterward, subjects reported their level of attraction toward their conversation partners. Then, Dr Hall and his team reviewed the interactions - and what signs of flirtation they had shown. 1-3 minutes . If someone begins talking to you by dishing out compliments and being encouraging to things you say, it is a good indicator they are interested - according to the researchers. Some people will also give a quick flirtatious glance at the start of the conversation. Crossing legs at any point, though, was a sign that a person was not interested in the other. Also, if a woman doesn't ask many questions, or shrugs a lot, she probably isn't interested. 4-6 minutes . If the person is still attracted to you, they will likely be even more affirmative, and also still quite complimentary. They will also begin ‘palming' - talking using open palm gestures. 7-9 minutes . Now, people start to do-away with compliments. Instead, men will gaze at their partner if they are interested at this point, while women might start to divulge some personal details. 10-12 minutes . At the end of the conversation, women will open up and be joyful, while still palming, if they are still interested. For women, you’ll want to look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction. This means they are still interested. The results suggest that, in general, in the first three minutes of conversation, people gave their partner a flirtatious glance if they were attracted to them. They also dished out a few compliments, and liked to be affirmative - being in agreement, passing encouragement or nodding along. In the next three minutes, people were even more affirmative, and still quite complimentary. At this point, they also become very keen on ‘palming’ - which means talking while using open palm gestures. In the next three minutes, though, people no longer relied on compliments. Throughout the conversation, but particularly at this point, men gazed at the women if they were attracted to them, while women who started sharing personal details were interested. In the final three minutes of the conversation, the best thing to look for if you’re a man is a woman who opens up, is smiling and laughing along, and is palming. For women, look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the early part of the interaction. But there were also some indicators of what people did when they were not interested, as well. For example, crossing legs at any point was a clear sign that someone was not attracted in the other person in the conversation. Touching the arm, chest, hair or so on was also a sign they were losing interest, while teasing was also something not really favoured. In addition, a woman who didn’t like the guy she was taking to typically didn’t ask him questions and shrugged, perhaps in indifference early on. By the end of the interaction, men who weren’t interested started crossing their arms, showing their lack of interest. Towards the end of a conversation, women become more expressive. Men, on the other hand, tend to lower the pitch of their voice later on. But crossed legs at any point are a clear sign someone isn't interested. And if a woman doesn't ask any questions, it's not a good sign (stock image shown) 1. Being joyful (smiling and laughing) 2. Affirmation (nodding, saying yes) 3. Keeping the conversation going . 4. Opening your arms . 5. Disclosing personal details . 6. Being expressive . 7. Gazing at your partner . 8. Being vocally animated . 9. Speaking with a higher pitch . 10. Self-touching (hair, face, body) 11. Playing with cards* . 12. Leaning forward . 13. Biting or licking lips . 14. Asking questions . 15. Shaking your head . 16. Playing with objects (clothes, etc) 17. ‘Presenting’ breasts . 18. Self-deprecating comment . 19. Moving closer . 20. Crossing legs . 21. Shrugging shoulders . 22. Open-palm gestures (palming) 23. Falling into your chair . 24. Flirtatious glances . 25. Compliments . 26. Teasing . *Note: These were the conversation prompt cards used in the study . Before the study, people self-identified their flirting styles in a questionnaire, breaking them down into physical, traditional, sincere, polite or playful flirts. The results are an amalgamation of the different types combined. The participants were given comfy blue chairs, with a coffee table nearby, when engaging in conversations with a partner. And they also had prompts that would help the conversations flow. Dr Hall explained: ‘We had prompt cards to read with questions to help them learn about other person, such as “what accomplishment are you most proud of?"" ‘These were meant to get the conversation going.’ First, they analysed the frequency of different types of flirting across all the groups. In total, 26 were identified, although some included groups of actions. The most popular was being joyful, such as laughing or smiling. In second was being affirmative, or in other words nodding and being in agreement with their partner when they were talking. Keeping the conversation flowing was also something most people aspired towards, while people preferred to have their arms open than closed. The technique that was performed least frequently was teasing the other person. The next least popular was being complimentary. Next, people rarely chose to ‘fall into their chair’ - which meant sitting back in surprise or excitement - and they also weren’t that keen on using flirtatious glances, either. Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Hall said he found some aspects of the research particularly interesting. ‘The most fascinating thing for me was teasing for everybody, whatever style, was negative in regards to being attractive,’ he said. In the final three minutes of the conversation, the best thing to look for if you’re a man is a woman who opens up, is smiling and laughing along, and is palming (an open palm gesture, such as in this stock image). For women, look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction . Another interesting indicator was that people who had a polite style of flirting tended to give their partner respect. They would lean back in their chair, create a distance between then, and be more evenly toned in their speech. He said that polite flirts thus had a hard time getting their message across, even if they were interested. So, what are Dr Hall’s dating tips? He says that, while there are general indicators, you should play close attention to what type of person your partner is. ‘Knowing your own flirting style, and knowing that of other people, can tell you about their intentions and what they expect out of it,’ he said. ‘Certain types give you clues about their style and ways of communication.’ He says you want to be direct, but not too embarrassing or forward, and always be on the eye out for non-verbal indicators, such as smiling and laughing or being engaged in the conversation.

"Sylvia Majewska was charged with two murder counts after the killings at her home in Oxford, Michigan . A Michigan judge has ruled that a 65-year-old mother accused of slashing the throat of her mentally-disabled son and beating her infant granddaughter to death is unfit for trial. Sylvia Majewska was charged with two counts of first-degree murder after the killings of Daryne Gailey, 29, and seven-month-old Charley Hendrick at her home in Oxford on November 23 last year. A District Court judge put proceedings on hold earlier today after a psychiatrist said during a competency hearing that Majewska is unfit to stand trial. During the course of their investigation, Oakland County authorities found evidence indicating the deaths were planned. County sheriff Michael Bouchard previously indicated Majewska 'came to the conclusion that the son and the child would be better off if they weren't alive'. She had previously sought a protective order against her son's ex-wife Amanda Hendrick. Gailey had learning disabilities and suffered seizures. Scroll down for video .

She was found at the scene of the killings with blood dripping from her arm into a bucket, the Oakland Press reported. Majewska's defense attorney Bill Mitchell said he was not surprised by the ruling, WXYZ reported. He said: 'I am asking people to reserve judgment. Majewska (left and right) faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole . After Majewska's son Gailey (right) married Amanda Hendrick (left), the 65-year-old mother filed a protective order against her. Gailey had learning disabilities and suffered seizures . During the investigation, Oakland County authorities found evidence indicating the deaths were planned . 'That, obviously, something is very wrong with this lady. 'Grandmothers and mothers don't behave as she is alleged to behave.' During a previous court appearance in December, Majewska appeared to be disoriented and said she was feeling 'really dizzy'. At the time, Mitchell said: 'She has difficulty understanding some things and communicating some things. 'She has obviously ― in my opinion, at least ― suffered from stress.' If convicted, Majewska faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole.","Sylvia Majewska, 65, is accused of slitting her son Daryne Gailey's throat .

"It's the country that wants its citizens to share in the American dream. But in a sign of the times figures show that more Americans gave up their U.S. citizenship in 2014 than ever before. According to figures released quarterly by the U.S. State Department, 3,415 people  ditched their U.S. citizenship in 2014. In contrast, just 2,999  renounced their citizenship in 2013, according to the figures obtained by Forbes. Figures released quarterly by the U.S. State Department show 3,415 decided to ditch their U.S. citizenship. The uptick may not be tremendous but the difference shows a 221 per cent increase altogether. And the rise has led the U.S. State Department to raise the fee for renunciation from $450 to $2,350 because of the extra work  to process people on their way out of the country. The reasons Americans are leaving for good vary but it's thought that the main reason that many make the decision to renounce citizenship  is due to the U.S. tax system. Americans who live abroad have to file taxes on worldwide income and must also submit to  bank account and financial reporting and disclosure. Failure to do so can result in penalties and even criminal charges. But many Americans who reside abroad  believe that the tax laws are inconvenient. In addition, U.S. citizens who live in a foreign country must also pay tax where they live. Exit tax: Senators Chuck Schumer, left, and Bob Casey, right, introduced a bill to double the exit tax to 30 per cent for anyone leaving the U.S. for tax reasons . Citizenship: Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin gave up his U.S. citizenship to live in Singapore . Understanding the U.S. tax system can be complicated and the penalties for flouting the law can be extremely costly. There is also a global system in place dubbed the annual foreign bank account reports known as FBARs which carry civil and even criminal penalties. Another procedure called FATCA requires filing an annual Form 8938 once foreign assets reach a particular amount. Over 100 foreign banks in international countries including Russia and China supply the names of Americans who have a particular amount in their bank accounts. It's led to some foreign banks not wanting to take on American account holders to avoid the paperwork. And there are even more difficulties for some Americans who want to leave as they have to pay an 'exit tax.' Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin is one of the country's most high profile examples of people who have renounced U.S. citizenship to live in Singapore. His departure led Senators Chuck Schumer and Bob Casey to introduce a bill to double the exit tax to 30 per cent for anyone leaving the U.S. for tax reasons. Under existing law, in order to leave America, you generally must prove five years of U.S. tax compliance. Those with a net worth greater than $2 million will pay an exit tax. Long-term residents who give up their Green Card may also have to pay the exit tax. Meanwhile, dual citizens in Canada who are trying to shed their U.S. citizenship have created a backlog at the U.S. consulate in Toronto.","The State Department said  3,415 people in total gave up U.S. citizenship .
This was an increase on 2013 when just 2,999 ditched their citizenship .

"A sham marriage plot fell apart when the bridegroom forgot his future wife's name and told the registrar they communicated only by laptop, a court heard yesterday. Zubair Khan was forced to phone his uncle to get the name of his bride-to-be during the first appointment with the official due to conduct the ceremony. The blunder gave the game away and police and immigration officials turned up at the wedding to arrest the pair before they took their vows. Khan, 28, a Pakistani national, was a former college student who turned to a sham marriage plot in a desperate attempt to stay in the UK because his student visa was about to expire. Zubair Khan, 28, (right) forgot the name of his future wife Beata Szilagyi (left) and claimed they had only communicated via laptop . His uncle Khaliq Khan, 48, a mobile phone businessman, agreed to help and they contacted Beata Szilagyi, 33, a jobless single mother from Hungary. They found her through a mutual friend. She was offered £2,000, which she considered a 'vast amount of money', to come to England to become his bride. As an EU national she was entitled to live in the UK. Yesterday both Khan and his uncle were jailed for 20 months at Hull Crown Court. Szilagyi, who has a toddler son, was jailed for 17 months. They all admitted conspiracy to breach UK immigration laws. Szilagyi from Hungary is questioned by officials. The single mother, who has a toddler son, was jailed for 17 months . The couple were arrested at Hull's Guildhall moments before the planned ceremony last October, which was attended by 15 guests. Both Khans lived in London but Hull was chosen as the wedding location because the uncle had a mobile phone stall in the local shopping centre. Police had been tipped off by registrar Kay Skelton, whose suspicions were aroused by the groom's behaviour at their first meeting. At a follow-up appointment attended by both bride and groom, Miss Skelton's fears were confirmed. 'The bride and groom did not communicate with each other or look at each other,' said Mr Thompson. 'Zubair Khan said they communicated entirely by lap top.' The registrar also noticed he seemed 'nervous and was sweating.'

"A woman whose vagina was so narrow she could no longer have sex has undergone successful surgery to have it reconstructed - using a pig's intestine. The woman had been sent for treatment after her gynaecologist found she was so narrow it was not even possible to carry out an examination. She was referred to the University Hospital in the town of Plzen, in the western Czech Republic . Doctors there decided to try out the operation after learning that a similar procedure involving pigs intestine could be used on people who had a narrow bladder. The woman had been sent for treatment because her vagina was so narrow it was impossible for her gynaecologist to carry out an examination (file picture) But they could find no literature or evidence that it had ever been used to help somebody like the young woman, the news agency CEN reports. She had reported the problem after suffering from scleroderma - a condition that results in hard, thickened areas of skin and sometimes problems with internal organs and blood vessels. The condition can cause a woman's vaginal opening to constrict - making sexual function harder - and can also cause decreased sexual lubrication. To try and help the woman, surgeons decided to carry out surgery using a technique called a Mesh Augmented Vaginal Reconstruction. This is usually performed on women who have suffered a pelvic organ prolapse and who are experiencing symptoms such as urinary incontinence. Because prolapse is associated with weakened internal supportive structures, a graft may be placed to strengthen the repair.

To try and help the woman, surgeons decided to carry out surgery using a technique called a Mesh Augmented Vaginal Reconstruction. This is usually performed for women who have suffered a pelvic organ prolapse and who are experiencing symptoms such as urinary incontinence. The graft may be made of natural tissue; such as human donor skin or fascia; or porcine (pig) intestine. Pig tissue is often used because its genetic make up is similar to that of humans. For over 30 years, scientists have been using pigs in a number of medical fields, including dermatology, cardiology and more. Scientists have even re-grown human leg muscles using implants made of pig bladder tissue. During surgery to treat the Czech patient, surgeons made an incision to enlarge the narrowed area. They then used the mesh - made from pig's intestine and just 1mm wide - to successfully widen the walls of her vagina. Over time, human tissue will be created around the net and the pig net will be absorbed by the body. The graft may be made of natural tissue, such as human donor skin or pig intestine.

And following the success of the operation, the doctors now plan to publish a scientific paper on the technique. Vladimir Kalis, head doctor of the gynaecological-obstetrical clinic at the hospital, told CEN: 'Two years ago, the woman started to have problems during sex. 'The illness had narrowed the vaginal entrance so much that even gynaecological examinations were not possible.' Dr Kalis said many women suffer with the same problem - but most are too embarrassed to ask for help. He said: 'In the case of the patient we operated on, she had been given various medications by her gynaecologist but nothing helped, so she referred to us.' He acknowledged that  vaginal surgery was not common and was usually to performed for the opposite problem. He added: 'The material used is referred to as pig net. 'Its thickness is about one millimetre. 'Over time human tissue will be created around the net and the pig net will be absorbed by the body.' He added that the surgery lasted about one hour and the patient left hospital after five days. Dr Kalis said: 'The patient is very happy now. The gynaecological examinations are not painful any more. Dr Vladimir Kalis (right), who treated the patient, said many women suffer the same problem - but are too embarrassed to ask for help . 'And although we have advised her not to engage in sexual activity at the moment, she should be able to recover a full and active sex life in about two years. 'Basically, she feels like a woman again.' Gabriela Levorova, a spokesperson for the hospital, confirmed staff had been unable to find any reference to a similar surgery being carried out anywhere else in the world, and believed it was the first of its kind. She added: 'If there was anywhere else, as far as we can find out they never published anything about it. 'It seems we are the first to publish the results of such as surgery in a professional medical publication.'","Czech woman had very narrow vagina due to the condition scleroderma .

"An eco-warrior has built a giant nesting box to live inside as part of a protest to stop trees being felled on a green belt of land. Dav Kahyk, 35, built the replica 6ft by 3ft plywood box - complete with a perch and circular entrance - in a bid to protect the wooded area in Stapleton, Bristol. Other protesters have set up netted hammocks between trees at risk of being axed, but Mr Kahyk decided to build the warmer structure as a symbol of their campaign. Scroll down for video . Dav Kahyk, pictured with friend Rosa, inside the human-sized bird box which has built in trees above Bristol . Eco-protester Rosa, left, inside the bird box, which Mr Kahyk, right, said is like a 'Hilton Hotel' in comparison to other campaigners who are sleeping in hammocks between trees . The trees are in the path of a controversial MetroBus route through Bristol and are due to be chopped down. Mr Kahyk, who is a tree surgeon, said: 'I've been climbing and rigging all day to get everything into place for another evening here. 'It is a 6ft by 3ft platform and on top there is a bird box about 6ft high on top of it. 'We decided to build the bird box as we thought it would prove why we are here - we are trying to prove that chopping down trees will take away wildlife's homes. The bird box is on a 6ft by 3ft platform (left) while other platforms have been constructed on opposite trees . A sign hangs between the trees, which are due to be felled, calling for the council to 'Redesign MetroBus' 'We're all living things, so if they decide to chop the trees down they will have to take the home with it.' 'There are two of us in there at the moment, but we've decided we're going to start taking it in turns. 'Everyone else is just sleeping in nets in the trees so this is much more luxurious - it's like a Hilton Hotel.' He added: 'It took us about a day to build. It is made completely of recyclable items. Plywood, carpet and lino. 'It took us an evening to build the platform and then it took us a day to build the building around it.' Protesters moved on to the allotments at the start of them month to protest against plans to fell trees after plans were made for the MetroBus route. Mr Kahyk built the giant nesting box as a symbol of their campaign and to try and stop the trees being felled . A protester makes his way across a rope strung between camps situated in trees at the protest site at Stapleton Allotments in Bristol . Campaigners are using ropes and pulley systems to hoist themselves between platforms in the trees . They have been using hot water bottles and extra jumpers to keep warm and say they 'huddle round like penguins' As well as platforms in the trees and hammocks between them, protesters have set up camp on the ground due to be cleared to make way for the new bus route . A High Court judge has now ruled that the group can be evicted from the land and bailiffs are set to move in over the weekend. Mr Kahyk, from Bristol, added: 'We've been here for five nights now. Maybe six actually, the days are all kind of merging into one. 'We will be staying here until we are physically removed by baliffs or they listen to us and decide against the scheme. 'We're keeping warm in the box with hot water bottles and extra jumpers, we're all huddled around like penguins. 'The bird box is much warmer than the outdoor nets, we've had a cold few nights so everyone wants the bird box.'

"A pensioner on social security who accidentally sent her rent check addressed to her landlord to Comcast found the company had cashed it when she asked for it back. Francis Wilson from Albuquerque, New Mexico unwittingly put her $235 rent check for her landlord in an envelope along with her $20 Comcast subscription payment and accidentally sent it off to the company. But when she realised her mistake and asked for it back, the Comcast admitted that they had already cashed the check and said they would only pay it back by putting credit on her account. Francis Wilson, 79, who discovered that she accidentally sent her $235 rent check addressed to her landlord to Comcast and the company then cashed it when she asked for it back . The 79-year-old, who needed the cash back to pay her landlord, begged Comcast to give her the money back but each time they refused her the refund. She told KRQR-TV: 'At first I couldn't think in my mind, where did I send the check? I just couldn't imagine that it was Comcast. 'They didn't even call me and tell me I had made the mistake. Who gave them the authority to cash the check?' It was only when Mrs Wilson called the local media to tell them of her story that Comcast relented and evetually gave her the money. As well as reimbursing the money, they also gave her $235 in cash and kept the $235 credit on her Comcast account. After asking Comcast to reimburse the check the cashed, pictured, the company refused and saying they could only credit her account . A spokeswoman from the firm explained that the check had been cashed as they use an automated payments system and nobody had personally handled the payment. She also added that as soon as the mistake was brought to their attention they quickly apologised and offered to pay her back. But Mrs Wilson added: 'It took a long time for this, it wasn't overnight.' Last week, Comcast also came under fire after it emerged an Illinois woman was sent a bill from the company addressed to 'Super Bi***' Mary Bauer said she had been battling with the company since last April, calling 'hundreds of times' as she tried to get them to restore the Hallmark Channel to her line-up. It was only when Mrs Wilson called the local media that Comcast relented and agreed to pay her the money back . Meanwhile another couple were sent a bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they tried to cancel their subscription. Lisa and Ricardo Brown from Spokane Washington said they wanted to cancel the cable on their Comcast account - which cost them $60 - after suffering financial difficulties. But Mrs Brown said the customer service representative transferred her to a retention specialist who attempted to persuade her to keep the cable and sign a new two-year contract. When the couple received their next bill, Mr Brown's name had been changed from Ricardo Brown to 'A**hole Brown.' In both cases Comcast were forced to apologise and said an internal investigation was underway.","Francis Wilson, 79, wrote out $235 rent check addressed to her landlord .

"A stripper faces live in prison for being filmed sexually abusing a toddler and having sex with a dog after being indicted Thursday. Angeline Lodice, of New Orleans, Louisiana, was arrested in October after the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office obtained videos and photos that showed her engaging in intercourse with a canine and sexually abusing a 4-year-old boy. She has been charged with aggravated rape of a victim under the age of 13, pornography involving juveniles, crimes against nature and sexual battery. Angeline Lodice (above) faces a life sentence after being filmed sexually abusing a child and having sex with a dog while she claims she is not guilty by reason of insanity . Lodice (above) has said she was drugged at the time and could not identify the child . Defense attorney Martin Regan told The Times-Picayune that his clients plans to plead not guilty by reason of insanity. 'I anticipate she'll undergo both psychiatric and psychological evaluations,' he said. She is being held on an $800,000 bond as set by Judge Scott Schlegel. While she faces a life sentence if found guilty, should the court decide she was insane at the time of the crimes, she would be held indefinitely at a state mental hospital for treatment. Should the court agree that she is mentally ill, she'll be sentenced to treatment at a state mental hospital where she would be held indefinitely . According to a police report obtained by The Times-Picayune, Lodice, 26, has admitted that the woman in the photos and video are her, but she did not identify the boy as she claims she was drugged. The abuse came to light after the father of the child was contacted by a relative of Lodice, who said he received photographs and videos of her and the child. She is currently being held at Jefferson Parish Correctional Center. The aggravated rape charges carry a sentence of life in prison without parole while the sexual battery and pornography charges each carry a sentences of a minimum of 25 years and maximum of 99 if convicted.

"Police and a prayer hall were the targets of two alleged terrorists arrested on Tuesday, an ongoing investigation has found. Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25, were arrested at their western Sydney home on Tuesday and charged with terrorism offences after a police raid allegedly uncovered a machete, a hunting knife, an Islamic State flag and a video featuring both the men, with one recorded making threats of carrying out a terrorist attack. Police on Friday said investigations into the pair had uncovered intelligence that police and a prayer hall were targets of a terrorist plot on Australian soil. Scroll down for video . Mohammad Kiad, 25 (left), and his Iraqi born housemate Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, (right) were arrested on terror charges in their shared squalid granny flat at Fairfield in Sydney's south-western suburbs on Tuesday . Investigators from the Joint Counter Terrorism Team have been dispatched overseas to continue investigations following this week's arrests. 'As a consequence of those ongoing investigations, further information obtained has indicated a number of targets on Australian soil,' NSW police and Australian Federal Police said in a statement. 'Those investigations have verified information that there were threats to police and also a prayer hall in Sydney.' 'There was no specified threat to a police facility or officer'. The Joint Counter Terrorism Team has confirmed the proposed threat to the prayer hall was abandoned. Accused pair al-Kutobi and Kiad ham it up in a photo while relaxing at home. Police have confirmed that non-specific officers and a prayer hall were the targets of their alleged planned attacks . 'Investigators will continue to verify a range of information that has been obtained,' the statement said. The AFP and the NSW police have again reminded all police officers to be vigilant regarding their safety. Al-Kutobi and Kiad were arrested on Tuesday just hours before they allegedly planned to carry out an attack. Lawyers for the two men flagged in court on Thursday that the pair would probably apply for bail next month. It comes after Daily Mail Australia learned the Al-Kutobi and Kiad are are now being held in protective custody inside Silverwater Jail, after being subjected to threats from other prisoners since their arrival. Silverwater Jail - is considered one of the toughest correctional facilities in Australia - it's where alleged terror suspects Mohammad Kiad and his flatmate Omar al-Kutobi are being held until their March court appearance and are believed to have been subjected to threats by fellow prisoners since they were taken into custody . Investigators from the Joint Counter Terrorism Team have been dispatched overseas to continue investigations following their arrests. Pictured: Kiad's Facebook page displayed photos of him at the gym and in traditional costumes . The prison has a long-held reputation for being among the toughest prisons in New South Wales. A police source revealed that 'these guys are typically cared for in a different way to the general population'. 'Anyone like them, who are accused of these sorts of offences, will come under particular attention (in jail).' However, Correction Services refused to be drawn on the matter when contacted by Daily Mail Australia. 'Due to legal advice we are unable to provide any detail because of privacy concerns, so we can neither confirm nor deny the claims.' Nor would they comment on suggestions the pair had expressed concern for their safety behind prison walls or that a third party had made a request on their behalf to have them protected from harm from the general population. Crown prosecutor Michael Allnut leaves Fairfield Local Court after the first mention on Wednesday of charges against Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25. They have both been charged with one count of 'do act in preparation/planning for terrorism act' and refused bail after being arrested in anti-terror raids in Sydney's south-western suburbs . The Prime Minister read from a statement in parliament, describing information surround the pair's arrest. 'Kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him, one of those arrested said this: 'I swear to almighty Allah we will carry out the first operation for the soldiers of the caliphate in Australia',' Mr Abbott said . Commonwealth DPP prosecutor Kay Marenos said the brief of evidence against the men was four pages long 'but that is likely to change' and included photographs and a short video. The pair appeared briefly via video from Silverwater Prison, dressed in their prison greens, on Wednesday. Government investigations into how al-Kutobi and Kiad were able to reside in Australia and receive welfare payments continues. It's been claimed al-Kutobi, an Iraqi national, flew into the country on a fake passport and was given a protection visa. All this comes amid claims, by some lawyers, that statements made by Prime Minister Abbott in parliament could prejudice a fair trial. Their Fairfield home, a granny flat in Sydney's south-west (pictured). The pair was living in squalid conditions and al-Kutobi, it's been revealed, flew into Australia in 2009 as an Iraqi national using another person's passport . Adam Houda has told the ABC that 'he (the Prime Minister) wants to milk this situation politically for all it's worth'. 'He's poisoning the minds of potential jurors out there. We have rules for a reason, to ensure fairness in courts.' The PM's office, however, insists he revealed details surrounding their arrest, with the full knowledge and consent of the Australian Federal Police. During Question Time in parliament, Mr Abbott gave a graphic description of the disturbing video. He explained that one of the men made threats about carrying out an attack on Australia and stabbing victims in their 'kidneys' and 'livers', whilst 'kneeling before the death cult flag with a knife in his hand and a machete before him'. Police on Friday said investigations into the pair had uncovered intelligence that police and a prayer hall were targets of a terrorist plot on Australian soil . The PM also informed parliament that the man on the video said: 'I swear to almighty Allah, blond people, there is no room for blame between you and us. We only are you, stabbing the kidneys and striking the necks.' However, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) has also issued a statement about Mr Abbott's comments, saying they would not affect their role. It reads: 'Given the concern for public safety that attaches to allegations of terrorism, senior government officials are often briefed on major counter-terrorism investigations.' 'They sometimes choose to provide additional information to the public as they see fit. 'The CDPP forms its own view about the evidence in any given case. 'The comments made by the Prime Minister in this case will not have any impact on the CDPP's role or function, especially as this is in the very early stages of the matter, and any jury trial is unlikely to take place until much later in the year.'

'That is where I met Graham and he showed me the rifle. We were just so surprised at what we had found.' The discovery was made by Graham Clifton, pictured above, under the floorboards in the bell tower during a revamp . Ms Morton added: 'The mystery remains as to how and why it got there in the first place. 'One assumes it must have been a bellringer in order to have had access to that part of the tower. 'There have been various suggestions, possibly a rogue First World War bellringer who did not want to return his weapon at the end of the war, or maybe the tower was used as a look-out by the home guard and then, for some reason, it was left there. 'Perhaps we will never know.' The rifle was taken away by the police to be made safe and it is hoped that it will return to the church.

"As the most romantic day of the year, Valentine’s is prime time for showering your sweetheart with affection  to show them how much you care. Unfortunately, for some women, February 14th has proved to be considerably more traumatic than romantic. From receiving a membership to a slimming club, to being left with an extortionate restaurant bill and even seeing their date get arrested, seven brave women share  their worst Valentine’s dates. Rugby player Naomi Brash, 22, was presented with a membership to Slimming World . NAOMI BRASH, 22, STUDENT FROM CANTERBURY . Naomi, a keen rugby player, has an athletic build - but was left 'astounded' when her date presented her with a membership to Slimming World during their romantic evening out. Speaking about her Valentine's Day horror, Naomi said: 'I play rugby and my weight is required for protection and I also carry a lot of muscle. 'I was gobsmacked when I was presented with a slimming club membership from a date on Valentine’s Day. 'It took a lot of effort not to tackle him to the ground and throw him headfirst out of the door.' Naomi waited until the next day and unsurprisingly dumped him, saying he 'simply wasn't man enough' for her. 'I am single and looking for love, but thankfully haven’t had any dating disasters since,' she added. MELINDA COOKSEY, 30, BRAND MANAGER FROM WORCESTER . A lady who presented her date with a stylish new shirt for Valentine's Day was left in shock when she was given an ironing set by her now ex-boyfriend in return. Melinda Cooksey, 30, was shocked to be given an ironing set for Valentine's Day . 'I was so shocked when my boyfriend at the time gave me an iron and an ironing board for Valentine’s,' said Melinda. 'I gave him a lovely new shirt, which he promptly asked me to iron for him.' The evening went from bad to worse for 30-year-old, who was on her way home for a romantic dinner with her man when her tyre suffered a puncture. 'I wasn’t able to change my tyre,' she explained. 'So I called my date and asked if he could come and help me as I was stranded and he was only a ten minute drive down the road.' Melinda couldn’t believe it when he told her he wasn’t coming because he had just showered and put on his new ironed shirt and he didn’t want to 'get dirty'. 'He told me to call the RAC instead, which I did, and I was forced to spend Valentine’s Day sat in the cold roadside on my own, completely miserable and fed up,' she recalled. 'I spent most of the night talking to the RAC man and when my car was up and running I went straight to my friend’s house for a takeaway. 'I swiftly dumped the boyfriend the next day - all because he didn’t want to get his ironed shirt dirty,' she added. KATIE FORD, 33, GYM OWNER AND PERSONAL TRAINER FROM SHEFFIELD . Katie Ford, 33, had a terrible evening after her date got drunk - and was arrested . Katie was 'really excited' about the romantic night out she had planned with her date, but February 14th turned into a disaster-filled evening - and ended with her man being arrested. 'I was really excited for a romantic night out with my date,' she explained. 'We went out for some drinks but he started to get drunk and began telling me about how great he was and how he would do anything for me. 'I couldn’t believe his ego but put it down to the drink and thought I’d give him a chance.' However, as he got drunker and drunker, Katie's date ended up getting into a fight with a total stranger at the bar for absolutely no reason at all. 'This resulted in the police coming and my date getting arrested. 'I was mortified,' she said. 'I ended up having to walk home alone in the dark in my high stiletto heels and broke up with him the next day.' SARAH DONOHUE, 44, PAGEANT ORGANISER FROM YORKSHIRE . Sarah Donohue, 44, owner of the Miss Galaxy Universe competition,  was left to pick up the tab . Sarah had been looking forward to a date with an officer in the Royal Marines, who promised her an evening she wouldn't forget - and she most certainly didn't. 'We went to an amazing, top class Indian restaurant and he took care of ordering a nice wine and an Indian banquet with all the trimmings,' she says. 'There was no expense spared - I was feeling flattered and enjoying his company, and as the wine was flowing, the bill was escalating.' However, when the bill came, Sarah's date disappeared to the little boy’s room and when he came back, he sat there with no intention of paying - or even splitting the bill. He proceeded to order even more drinks and then asked Sarah if she was OK to pick up the tab. 'I was dumbfounded to say the least and ended up just paying the whole bill because it was so awkward and embarrassing - even though it was in the hundreds,' she recalled. 'I don’t expect a man to pay at all, but when my date acted like he wanted to treat me, I was furious to find out it was all an act to show off, and to leave me to pay was just rude.' She continued: 'His excuse was that I was an independent lady and he didn’t want to insult me! It was a joke. 'Needless to say, I never saw him again and I have now found another Royal Marine, who treats me like a lady and I am now happily engaged to.' JENNY NAYLOR, 23, TEACHER FROM LONDON . Jenny Naylor, a 23-year-old teacher, was gifted a ring her date found on the street . Jenny was looking forward to spending her romantic day with her now ex-boyfriend - and had heard from her friends that he had really splashed out on her gift. The couple spent the day together at Jenny's home  and she waited excitedly as he disappeared to pick up her presents. Recalling the incident, Jenny explained: 'Like most women, I love being treated on Valentine's Day and my boyfriend at the time asked me to hold out my hand and close my eyes. 'When I opened them, there was a gold ring in my hand.' Initially ecstatic, Jenny proudly put the ring on but doubt started to set in after she realised it hadn't come in a box and she had developed a rash on her finger from wearing it. Her friends later revealed that her partner had actually found the ring in the middle of the road and passed it off as a romantic gift he had hand-picked and paid for himself. 'I took it to a jewellers in the hope that it could be valuable,' she said. 'The worst part was, it was worth about £20.' AVERIL HENRY, 36, SENIOR ADMINISTRATOR FROM EAST LONDON . Averil Henry, 36,  was 'unimpressed' when her date brought his sister along to the date . Averil's Valentine's evening got off to a bad start almost immediately, when she realised her date had invited his sister along. Speaking about the evening, she said: 'I was taken on a date to a lovely restaurant for Valentine’s Day but my date also invited his sister along because she was on her own - although he failed to mention this to me until they turned up.' Averil was left 'unimpressed' - all the more so because it was the couple's first Valentine's together - and found the whole affair 'very awkward'. 'The conversation went rapidly downhill during dinner and my date ended up paying the bill and storming off,' she said. 'As me and his sister were left at the table we ended up laughing about it and decided to go out clubbing.' She may have lost her boyfriend but she left the awkward date with a new friend. 'Me and his sister are now good friends,' she says. 'He is history and I am happy in a new relationship - where he doesn’t bring his sister on dates!'. Freya Taylor, 22, had a rather awkward date after her partner contracted food poisoning . FREYA TAYLOR, 22, WAITRESS FROM EXETER . 'My date was actually pretty decent,' says Exeter waitress, Freya Taylor. 'My boyfriend had forked for an evening at a certain celebrity chef’s restaurant in the centre of London.' But while the five course tasting menu proved delicious, it included a dozen oysters each. 'Towards the end of the evening, my boyfriend’s toilet visits became more frequent and soon enough I was in on the act. 'We soon realised that both of us had got food poisoning from the oysters. Although we did spend the rest of the evening together, it was  at opposite ends of the house with only a toilet brush for company.' Do YOU have a Valentine's tale to rival these ladies'?

"Valentine's Day is almost upon us and, while hearts and flowers help, nothing says romance quite like a glass or two of champagne. And while we all like a sip of Taittinger, Mumm or Moët, their hefty price tags put them out of reach for the more cash-strapped. But having a less-than-royal bank balance doesn't mean you can't enjoy a glass or two of champagne, thanks to the wealth of cut-price options being offered by supermarkets. Cheers! Stick to supermarket champagnes this Valentine's Day to make big savings . Top on the affordable list is Asda's Louvel Fontaine Champagne that comes in at a very reasonable £10 per bottle. Well balanced and fruity, Louvel Fontaine is a blend of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier grapes and offers lingering flavours of fresh citrus and hints of vanilla. Slightly more expensive is Lidl's Valentine's Day offering, the Comte De Brismand (£11.99, 75cl), a dry, well-balanced and classy tipple. According to wine experts, the blend looks set to be as popular as their £17.99 Comte de Senneval Grand Cru champagne which beat Harrods version in the One Show's blind taste test last year. Aldi's excellent Champagne Veuve Monsigny (£11.99) is golden-hued with small bubbles that go up in a perfect upward spiral, and a nice crisp flavour. Daily Mail expert wine Olly Smith said: 'With its upbeat intensity and truffly scent, this champagne is so keenly priced it'll sell out fast. Seize it.' For those who prefer their bubbles a little sweeter, the supermarket also offers Pink Champagne Brut NV at £15.99 for 75cl. Bargain bubbles: Aldi's Champagne Veuve Monsigny  (left) and Tesco's Louis Delaunay Champagne both cost less than £13 each . Sainsbury's Blanc de Blanc is made from 100% Chardonnay grapes and is perfect to serve with sweet dessert nibbles Morrison's Signature Brut Champagne has lemon and floral aromas and creamy, toasty flavours . Tesco's Louis Delaunay Champagne, which comes from the town of Dizy in Champagne, has gorgeous floral aromas and elegant citrus fruit flavours. The £25.99 bottle is currently being sold at half price for £12.99, with the offer running until the 17th February. Marks & Spencer's Abel Charlot NV is also being sold at half price and costs £16 - down from the usual price of £32. The supermarket is also running a buy six, save 25 per cent special offer, resulting in a £24 saving for those who want to bulk buy. With fine bubbles, creamy lemon shortbread aromas and smooth, lush caramelised hazelnut flavours, this a powerful dry champagne. Morrisons Signature Brut Champagne, NV ( £18.99, 75cl) is slightly more expensive but has lovely  lemon and floral aromas and classic creamy, toasty flavours, which make it worth the price tag. Sainsbury's Blanc de Blanc Champagne (£20.00) is slightly more expensive but it did top the charts as the the highest scoring own label champagne in the Best Buy category in a recent Which? December 14' survey. An elegant champagne, made from 100 per cent Chardonnay grapes, has delicate floral aromas and citrus notes – perfect to serve with sweet dessert nibbles. Anne Jones, Wine, Beer and Spirits category manager at Waitrose, reveals which Valentine's Day champagnes are worth splashing out on. Which champagne would you recommend for Valentine's Day? 'Definitely the Pol Roger Brut NV, £39.99, it has a rich flavourful style. For those on a tighter budget the Waitrose Brut NV, £19.99, which is exceptional value and tastes great. Alternatively a style called Crémant is made in a similar way but with a gentler fizz - try the Cave de Lugny Crémant de Bourgogne, £13.99. Are there any champagne alternatives you would recommend? 'For Prosecco-lovers, the Waitrose NV Italian Prosecco, £8.99, is a classic, crisp fizz. Cava is also hugely under-rated and improving in quality all the time, and is made by using the same method as champagne. 'You can get great examples for under £10 such as the Waitrose Brut NV Spanish Cava, £6.99. In the spirit of Valentine's Day, which pink fizz would you select? 'Pink fizz is an obvious choice for Valentine's Day, and it can also be a great way to be creative as well as save some money. If you want champagne, the Alexandre Bonnet Brut Rose (£26.99) is superb. What would you recommend to those who are looking for a low-alcohol option? 'Prosecco usually has slightly lower alcohol than champagne or Cava, but if you really want to pace yourself, the soft, fruity, slightly sweet style of Asti is only seven per cent. 'I would recommend the San Leo Asti, £9.99 – it's also delicious with puddings!'","Lidl and Aldi both have bottles of champagne that come under £12 .

"He may have helped to build the internet, but Dr Vinton ‘Vint’ Cerf has urged computer users to print out their most treasured photographs, or risk losing them. The Google vice president warned that as operating systems and software become more sophisticated, documents and images stored using older technology will become increasingly inaccessible. He went on to say that our dependence on  technology could lead to the 21st century being a new dark age in history, with any evidence of our culture lost in a digital 'black hole'. 'Father of the internet' Dr Vinton Cerf (pictured) has warned that digital technology could turn the 21st century into a new dark age lost to history. He said  that as operating systems and software get upgraded, documents and images stored using older technology are becoming increasingly inaccessible . In centuries to come, future historians looking back on the current era could be confronted by a digital desert comparable with the dark ages - the post-Roman period in Western Europe about which relatively little is known because of the scarcity of written records. Dr Cerf, who also has the title of Chief Internet Evangelist at Google, said: ‘If we’re thinking 1,000 years, 3,000 years ahead in the future, we have to ask ourselves, how do we preserve all the bits that we need in order to correctly interpret the digital objects we create? ‘We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it. Dr Cerf suggested that people print off important photos and documents to preserve memories. A photo of the British Library is shown . ‘The 22nd century and future centuries after that will wonder about us but they’ll have great difficulty knowing much because so much of what we’ve left behind may be bits that are uninterpretable.’ He urged people to think about printing out their treasured photos and not rely on storing them as memory files. ‘In our zeal to get excited about digitising we digitise photographs thinking it’s going to make them last longer, and we might turn out to be wrong,’ he said. ‘I would say if there are photos you are really concerned about create a physical instance of them. Print them out.’ Dr Cerf was speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Jose, California. To illustrate his point he referred to an ‘amazing book’ by American Pulitzer prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, titled ‘Team of rivals: The political genius of Abraham Lincoln’. Her material was obtained by scouring libraries for copies of written correspondence between Lincoln and the people around him. Dr Cerf said: ‘Let us imagine that there’s a 22nd-century Doris Kearns Goodwin and she decides to write about the beginning of the 21st century and seeks to reproduce the conversations of the time. ‘She discovers that there’s an awful lot of digital content that either has evaporated because nobody saved it, or its around but it’s not interpretable because it was created by software that’s 100 years old.’ Mr Cerf said: ‘We are nonchalantly throwing all of our data into what could become an information black hole without realising it.' For example, it is hard to read documents saved on floppy disks (pictured) The problem also had serious implications for the storage of legal documents that needed to be kept for long periods of time, he said. ‘We’re going to have to build into our thinking the concept of preservation writ large,’ Dr Cerf added. One possible solution is what he called ‘digital vellum’, a concept now being explored by computer scientists at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. This involves taking a digital 'snapshot' at the time an item is stored of all the processes needed to reproduce it at a later date, including the software and operating system. Vint Cerf was among five men who won the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering for the creation of the internet as we know it. He shared the £1million prize with Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Kahn, Louis Pouzin and Marc Andreessen. The citation panel said the five men had all contributed to the revolution in communications that has taken place in recent decades. Vint Cerf (pictured left) shared the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, presented by the Queen, with Robert Kahn (second left), Tim Berners Lee (second from right), Louis Pouzin (right) and Marc Andreessen (not pictured) Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf provided the engineering insights that actually made the internet work. Their TCP/IP protocols define the way data travels around the internet. Sir Tim Berners Lee told the BBC: ‘The prize recognises what has been a roller-coaster ride of wonderful international collaboration. ‘Bob and Vint's work on building the internet was re-enforced by Louis' work on datagrams and that enabled me to invent the web. ‘Marc's determined and perceptive work built on these platforms a product which became widely deployed across nations and computing platforms.’ It’s estimated that a third of the world's population now uses the internet. Around 330 petabytes of data are estimated to be carried across its servers each year, which is enough capacity to transfer every character ever written in every book ever published 20 times over. The snapshot could then be used to reproduce the game, picture file or spread sheet, on a modern computer, perhaps centuries from now. ‘Some people make the argument that the important stuff will be copied and put into new media and so why should we worry,’ said Dr Cerf. ‘But ... historians will tell you that sometimes documents and transactions images and so on may turn out to have an importance which is not understood for hundreds of years. So failure to preserve them will cause us to lose our perspective.’","Dr Vint Cerf warned that as operating systems and software get updated, documents and photos stored on old tech are becoming inaccessible .

"Samsung is set to ring in the changes with its Galaxy S6 handset and abandon its much criticised practise of filling the handset with unwanted 'bloatware,' it has been claimed. Samsung's next generation Galaxy handset is set to come in two versions - one with a curved screen that covers both its sides, and be revealed on March 1st. Now it is claimed the software will also see a radical change. Scroll down for video . A Samsung Galaxy Note E, the first to use Samsung's curved screen. It is claimed the Galaxy S6 could come in a special edition with both sides featuring the technology. Bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones, tablets, or computers. As well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files, bloatware can also slow down your device. Bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars, desktop widgets or other unwanted additions. 'Software has always been the Achilles heel for Samsung,' said Sammobile, which made the claim. 'There are some really interesting things Samsung is doing if our info is correct, and perhaps the biggest change the S6 will bring is the removal of all pre-installed Samsung apps, or at least that’s how our insider put it.' The Korean firm has been heavily criticised in the past for only offering half the storage its customers pay for and although this has been improved with the S5, it is still a problem. MailOnline revealed that on a 16GB Samsung S5, users get approximately 10GB of space for their own personal files, photos and apps. However, the Galaxy S6 will come with apps like Microsoft OneNote, OneDrive, Office Mobile (with a free Office 365 subscription), and Skype, according to Sammobile. Both new S6 phones will have all-metal bodies and 5.1inch screens, it has been claimed. 'Samsung Electronics Co. plans to release two new versions of its top-tier Galaxy smartphone next month, including a model with a display covering three sides, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter,' Bloomberg said. The  'special edition' version will have the curved technology, according to Sammobile. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. 'Today, we can confirm that Samsung is indeed developing a Galaxy S6 with two-edge displays, one on each side, reports our source,' said the Sammobile site. The curved screen has already been used  in Samsung's Note Edge. In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB) Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F, the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6, will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) 5.5inch display. It will also have an octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. The handset is expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, a trade show in Barcelona, which takes place from 2-5 March. However, S6 Edge will have the ability to work in a left or right handed mode . 'You will have an option to choose favourite contacts and an ability to assign specific colours to them,' explained Sammobile. 'So, calls and notifications from important people will show the designated color lighting on the edge area.' Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. These images, which appear to have been taken in a toilet, show a rounded edge and antenna bars almost identical to Apple's iPhone 6 in the 'standard' version of the handset . Because the curved edge remains visible even if a flip-book style protective cover is used, it is easier to keep up-to-date with incoming calls and messages. Previous leaks from BGR say the SM-G925F — the codename believed to be assigned to the Galaxy S6 — will feature a Quad HD (2560 x 1440 resolution) display, octa-core processor, Mali-T768 graphics processing unit, and a 16-megapixel rear-facing camera. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. Apple's On 1 March, Samsung and HTC are separately hosting events in Barcelona, to kick off this year's Mobile World Congress (MWC). HTC is expected to unveil its HTC One M9, while Samsung will likely use its event to announce the Samsung Galaxy S6. Samsung's invite hints at a curved device (pictured) Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC. Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system. But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. Last month, for the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits took a hit. The smartphone maker reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to the same time last year. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September. These figures were in line with what Samsung predicted earlier in October, and the firm blamed the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model. The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung also vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured Samsung Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Mr Yi. The earnings were below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. The latest profit drop comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple.","16GB Samsung S5 users get approximately 10GB of space left .

"Charged with murder: John Hicks, 19, stands accused of killing the two men . The second victim of a shooting during the first Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans died of wounds to his neck, as police charged a 19-year-old with his murder. The unnamed man died Friday morning after spending the night in hospital after John Hicks, allegedly drew his weapon and opened fire. Yesterday night the first victim, an unnamed 21-year-old, died last night from bullet wounds to his chest. Hicks has been charged with two counts of murder and one of illegally using a firearm, the New Orleans Police Department said. Officers say Hicks starting shooting around 10pm Thursday during the first round of celebrations on St Charles Avenue. The two men are seemingly the only ones who were hurt in the attack. Both were taken to hospital. The 21-year-old died during surgery as doctors fought to save him. Thursday night the 22-year-old was said to be in a critical condition, but his death was confirmed Friday morning. Police arrested Hicks last night but did not name him until he had been charged. Officers say they found a gun near the scene of the crimes. The shooting occurred during the Muses parade, the traditional kick off to the Carnival weekend on St Charles Avenue. The New Orleans Advocate reported that two or three shots could be heard, which sent the crowd scrambling and saw frantic parents herding their children to safety. Police then descended and administered CPR to one of the victim's in front of a Popeye's restaurant as a young woman cried nearby. He was then taken to hospital by emergency services.

Parade floats pass by officers of the New Orleans Police Department who were deployed to the parade route after the shooting . The suspect initially attempted to flee along but was caught at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Baronne Street. Officers stationed nearby also responded immediately and barriers were set up, but the parade still rolled on. Angela Matherne, a resident of Thibodaux, Louisiana, was taking in the parade with family when the shooting happened a block away. Ms Matherne said she didn't hear anything 'but saw people running in our direction and police in the opposite.' She added that the parade kept going so she didn't realize there had been a shooting until later, when she left the parade route. The city will host several parades daily until Mardi Gras, which is on Tuesday. Members of the Bearded Oysters parade down St Charles Avenue during the first Mardi Gras parade of the carnival .

"An Instagram account which shames men who turn hostile when rejected on dating apps has now attracted more than 300,000 followers. The Bye Felipe Instagram account is a place where women can expose the bullying and rude reactions provoked simply by telling a man they are not interested. As previously reported by MailOnline, the posts - which appear in the form of screen grabs - are not  for the faint-hearted and often include extremely vulgar language. Scroll down for video . The Instagram account which shames guys who turn hostile when rejected on dating apps features posts like this one where a man calls a woman 'ugly', 'fat' and a 'heffer' for not contacting him . In another weight-related jibe, this man says a woman needs to 'lose 20lbs' after she politely tells him she doesn't think they are a match when he asks her on a date . Apart from the disturbing choice of words, the retorts are often nasty and expose a disturbing amount of bullying behaviour. It seems previous publicity surrounding the account has not made men wary of what they say in messages as a plethora of new posts have been added in recent weeks. For example, one man turns ugly after a woman refuses to tell him why she isn't responding to his messages. He writes: 'Can't be cuz (sic) I'm over weight cuz you're even more fat... can't be cuz I'm ugly because you're uglier.' When she fails to respond again, he calls her a 'heffer'. As this example shows, a theme which often arises in the abusive messages is weight. The retorts, like this one where a man starts name calling after his messages are ignored, display a disturbing amount of bullying behaviour . In this post a woman is called a 'fat ass' for not replying to messages . Another man calls a woman a 'fat pig' and 'fat and ugly' after she ignores him. Many other similar messages on the Instagram account are unsuitable for publication . Another rejected man suggests he and the woman would be more compatible 'if you lost 20lb'. Meanwhile, another calls a girl a 'fat pig' after ignoring him on the site. These are sadly the least offensive of the posts online - most are unsuitable for publication. The account was created by American Alexandra Tweten as a means of allowing women to name and shame men who trolled them. 'I realised these hostile messages were a trend that women see online,' the operations coordinator told The Huffington Post. 'All women get some degree of creepy or weird messages when they sign up for online dating sites.' In this message, a man demands to know why a woman has disliked him on Tinder . This man starts off being complimentary but changes his tune after being rejected . Alexandra hopes that the account will help women who have suffered any kind of hostile or abusive dating messages to realise that they are not alone. And having sifted through a seemingly-endless stream of submissions, she points out that there is a clear and obvious pattern in the behavior of almost all of the aggressive messengers. 'It's a standard reaction that I've now seen over and over again with the submissions,' she added. 'Guy hits on girl, girl doesn't respond, guy lashes out with insulting message. It really shows the entitlement these guys feel, and I think it shows our cultural misogyny problem.' CleverPoint, a technology consulting company based in San Francisco, decided to put Alexandra's claims to the test and created an experiment to examine male behaviour on dating sites. This texter tells a woman she's 'two out of ten' when she chooses not to message him back . The company built a Tinder robot using pictures from a willing volunteer, Lisa Winning, a CEO of dating network HeTexted. The robot right-swiped on 1,000 profiles of men in San Francisco and another 1,000 in New York City. Over a thousand men messaged Lisa - but since this was a robot and not actually her, none of the guys received any responses. Alexandra Tweten set up the Instagram account Bye Felipe so women could expose misogyny . This sender displays a short temper when his messages are ignored . This 'creepy' man goes from calling a woman his 'love' to a 'pain in the ass' in a matter of minutes . This sender makes some insulting assumptions when his message is ignored . 'We were afraid they’d become hostile after being ignored, like we’d seen on Bye Felipe so many times before,' says Paul Mestemaker, who runs CleverPoint. But out of 1,007 men who messaged Lisa, none became hostile when they didn't receive a response. 'Just about everyone who messaged her was friendly and respectful. Sure, there was teasing, guys who were straightforward about their intention to hook up, and plenty of bad pickup lines. But no one became hostile or resorted to name-calling,' he says. The findings may make women feel more confident about dating this Valentine's Day given the Bye Felipe Instagram account is enough to put anyone off looking for love online. A request of a date quickly turns into name calling in this post . This man becomes alarmingly offensive suggesting violence when he's rejected .","Bye Felipe Instagram account shows unpleasant  side of online dating .

"When Islamic extremists snatched more than 270 girls from the Chibok boarding school in Nigeria in the dead of night, protests broke out worldwide. The U.S. pledged to help find them, and the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag was born. Some 10 months later, most are still missing. The Boko Haram extremist group sees the mass kidnapping as a shining symbol of success, and has abducted hundreds of other girls, boys and women. The militants brag to their new captives about the surrender of the Chibok girls, their conversion to Islam and their marriage to fighters. 'They told me the Chibok girls have a new life where they learn to fight,' says Abigail John, 15, who was held by Boko Haram for more than four weeks before escaping. 'They said we should be like them and accept Islam.' Scroll down for video . Dorcas Aiden, 20, was living at home when the war came to her village. Fighters took her to a house in the town of Gulak and held her captive for two weeks last September . Aiden said that the more than 50 teenage girls crammed into a house with her were beaten if they refused to study Quranic verses or conduct daily Muslim prayers . The kidnappings reflect the growing ambition and brazenness of Boko Haram, which seeks to impose an Islamic state across Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. Some 10,000 people have died in the Islamic uprising over the past year, compared to 2,000 in the previous four years, according to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations. 'It's devastating,' said Bukky Shonibare, an activist in Abuja, of the kidnappings. 'It makes you wonder, what is being done?' John was among three girls interviewed by The Associated Press who recently escaped from Boko Haram. While their stories could not be independently verified, they were strikingly similar, and all spoke of their captors' obsession with the Chibok girls. The girls had no idea whether the militants were telling the truth or making up stories to taunt their victims. John says the fighters enjoyed relating how they had whipped and slapped the Chibok girls until they submitted. When the Nigerian air force dropped a bomb on the house where John was confined, she tried to escape, she says. She wrestled with the fighters, but they broke her am and hauled her off to another house. At the end of last year, the Nigerian army liberated the town where she was held. She is now in Yola with her father, sister and six brothers, in a house overcrowded with refugees. She finally was able to get medical attention for her fractured right arm, which remains in a cast. Abigail John said that Boko Haram fighters told her that the Chibok girls were learning to fight . John, 15, was held by Boko Haram for more than four weeks before escaping. Her arm was broken by one of the terrorists . The kidnappings of the Chibok girls in April brought Boko Haram to the world's attention in a way the group could not have imagined. The hashtag #BringBackOurGirls was tweeted more than 480,000 times globally in early May, and U.S. first lady Michelle Obama held it up in a sign to television cameras. She said at the time, 'In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters ...we can only imagine the anguish their parents are feeling right now.' On Wednesday, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan again promised the girls will be brought home alive, saying he is 'more hopeful' about their fate now that a multinational force is being formed to fight Boko Haram. 'Give us some time over the Chibok girls. The story will be better in a few weeks,' Jonathan promised, as he has many times in the past, on a nationally televised program. In the 10 months since the mass kidnapping, Boko Haram has increased the tempo and ferocity of its insurgency. In August, it began seizing and holding towns, and — copying the Islamic State group — declared it would recreate an ancient Islamic caliphate in the region. The fighting has since spilled across Nigeria's borders, and the African Union this month authorized a multinational force of 8,750 troops to try to stamp it out. Dorcas Aiden, 20, was another of those caught in Boko Haram's siege. She had finished high school and was living at home when the war came to her village. Fighters took her to a house in the town of Gulak and held her captive for two weeks last September. A total of 276 girls (pictured) were abducted on April 14 last year from the northeastern town of Chibok, in Borno state . The more than 50 teenage girls crammed into the house were beaten if they refused to study Quranic verses or conduct daily Muslim prayers, she says. When the fighters got angry, they shot their guns in the air. Aiden finally gave in and denied her Christian faith to become Muslim, at least in name, she says. One day, the fighters stormed into the room where she was kept locked up with a dozen other girls. They showed a video of the Chibok girls, dressed in hijabs, with only their faces visible through their veils. Aiden says she was so overwhelmed that she cried. The fighters said the Chibok girls were all Muslims now, and some were training as fighters to fight women, which Boko Haram men are not supposed to do. Aiden's captors boasted about how they had married off the Chibok girls, she says. One fighter said he would marry her. She balked. 'I said, 'No, I will not marry you,'' Aiden recounts. 'So he pulled out a gun and beat my hand.' Aiden says the insurgents threatened to break the legs of any girl who tried to escape, but she and six others ran anyway. As she made her way through abandoned farm fields, she noticed that Boko Haram had filled about 10 other houses with kidnapped girls and women. Aiden, who is now in Yola with tens of thousands of other refugees, dreams of going to university, in defiance of the extremists' insistence that girls should be married, not educated. The nickname Boko Haram means 'Western education is forbidden or sinful.' Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau speaking on a video released by the extremist group following the Chibok kidnapping . Another escapee, a shy 16-year-old captured in September, begs that her name not be published because she escaped only a few weeks ago and believes the fighters are actively searching for her. After the girl's village was attacked four times, she fled to a great-aunt. Then that village also was targeted, she says. The fighters held her for four months. When she escaped, she walked through the bush and across the border into Cameroon to avoid areas under Boko Haram's control. She is now taking refuge in a Catholic church in Yola. All the girls say they were not raped, despite the fears of some villagers. Instead, the fighters said they wanted the girls to remain virgins until they were married off. 'They said they are doing the work of God, so they will not touch us,' the 16-year-old recounts. As she tells her story, she fidgets and looks down at her hands, clasped in her lap. She recounts how one fighter, nicknamed 'Tall Arab,' was set on marrying her. She pleaded that she was too young, but was told, 'Do you think you are better than those Chibok girls that we kidnapped?' The man told her the Chibok girls were 'enjoying their matrimonial homes,' she remembers. He also said the Chibok girls had turned against their parents, and were 'ready to slit their parents' throats' if they ever saw them again. Some never will. Even if the girls are released, people in Chibok say at least 13 of their parents have died since they were seized, in Boko Haram violence or possibly stress-related illness. While dozens of Chibok girls escaped on their own after their kidnapping, 219 are still missing. Nigeria's military initially feared any action could lead to the girls being killed. But villagers reported last week that air force jets have begun bombing the Sambisa Forest — the area where fighters told Aiden some girls still are held captive. Meanwhile, suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a village on the shore of Lake Chad early Friday, marking the first such violence against the neighbor contributing the most military might to the regional fight against the Nigeria-based terror group. The assault took place in the village of Ngouboua, according to army Col. Azem Bermandoa. It was not immediately known how many civilians were killed during the attack, he said. 'The assailants have scattered and the army is now pursuing them,' Bermandoa told The Associated Press by telephone. Boko Haram has expanded its attacks against neighboring countries over the past week following threats to punish any nations contributing to the fight against the terror group. Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Benin all have pledged to send military support though Chadian soldiers are already fighting Boko Haram militants inside Cameroon and Nigeria. The multinational force to fight Boko Haram is expected to be formally launched in the coming weeks. Ngouboua is already home to nearly 3,300 refugees who had fled the Boko Haram-related violence back home in Nigeria, according to the United Nations.","Worldwide protests followed kidnapping of 270 girls by Boko Haram .

"A beauty therapist who posted dozens of 'selfie' pictures of her new slimline figure on Facebook said she was shocked and upset after being reported to the website for encouraging 'nudity'. Alyson Larkin, 33, gorged on junk food and fizzy drinks for years and saw her weight soar due to her unhealthy lifestyle. After failing to fit into her trousers before a holiday to Australia in 2012, the mother-of-one decided to change her life and set about transforming her body - losing three stone in less than a year. She regularly took to Facebook to document her changing physique  but was reduced to tears after an anonymous 'nudity' complaint was made to the website about a photo in which she is wearing normal gym attire. Photo that prompted complaint: Alyson Larkin, 33, received a notification telling her that this photo of her in gym attire had been complained about by another Facebook user due to its level of 'nudity' The mother-of-one said: 'It actually made me cry as I felt hurt that people think I would do something wrong. How anyone could say that picture was encouraging nudity is beyond me.' Ms Larkin, of Inverclyde, Scotland, had lived on microwave meals and takeaways during her worst days - while drinking five cans of coke and downing a glass of wine every day. After realising some of her clothes no longer fit her, she embarked on a strict health mission - even selling her Vauxhall Corsa so that she was forced to walk everywhere. In less than a year, she lost three stone and dropped three dress sizes as well as joining an online weight loss programme which encourages people to eat healthily and exercise. Showing off: Ms Larkin said she is extremely proud of the way that she has transformed her body . Describing her Facebook weight loss pictures, she added: 'I'm not interested in promoting skinny bodies from fad diets. 'I'm just showing people how I look after changing my own lifestyle to one of eating healthy meals and regular exercise.' Ms Larkin received a message from Facebook notifying her an anonymous complaint had been made about one picture. The message said: 'Someone has reported your photo for displaying nudity.' The 'selfie' image showed a before and after image she had taken showing herself when she was heavier and how she appears now. She added: 'I post a lot of pictures of myself but that's because I've got them on my phone so it's easier to do, anyone who knows me in real life will know that I'm just pretty normal and have a smile for every person I meet. Series of selfies: Ms Larkin took to Facebook to document her progress in her mission to lose weight . Messages of support: Since the complaint became public knowledge, the mother has been flooded with messages from friends complimenting her 'beautiful' figure . 'I won't stop posting my pictures because of a minority. For every person who doesn't like it there's ten more message me on a daily basis to say they're great. 'I am proud of my body, I work hard at it and if I want to show people where a wee bit of hard work can get you I will. 'So my message for anyone who doesn't like it is delete me from Facebook and don't look at it.' Dozens of messages of support for Aly were left on her Facebook page by outraged friends. Bernadette Gillan said: 'They're just jealous honey you look beautiful, very proud of you. I love seeing your pictures, you work hard xxxxxxx.' Michelle Brown wrote: 'You shouldn't feel like you have to explain yourself and you certainly should be bloody proud of your body, you look fantastic and work hard for it! Xx.' Fitness regime: She embarked on the health mission after discovering she could no longer fit into her trousers - and even sold her car so that she would be forced to walk everywhere . Allowed to stay online: The new fitness fanatic received a notification saying her photo had not been removed by Facebook moderaters despite being the subject of a complaint . Andrea McAuley added: 'You should be proud you fitty! And fair play to you for promoting a healthy body image/confidence and hard work. Don't let others get you down. Chin up buttercup and stick at it.' Facebook rules state: 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. 'We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding. 'If you see something on Facebook that you believe violates our terms, you should report it to us. Please keep in mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. 'For this reason, we also offer personal controls over what you see, such as the ability to hide or quietly cut ties with people, pages, or applications that offend you.' Upset: Ms Larkin said she cried when she found out that someone had reported her Facebook photos for being inappropriate - adding 'wow anyone could say that picture was encouraging nudity is beyond me' On a mission: The mother said 'I won't stop posting my pictures because of a minority.

"A London man fighting for ISIS in Syria is being investigated over the chilling footage of a Jordanian pilot burned alive in a cage. Nero Saraiva, 28, is thought to have risen in the ranks to become one of ISIS's most senior fighters, working side-by-side with the British man seen beheading hostages in a number of videos, known as Jihadi John. There is a possible link between the Jihadi John videos and the footage showing the barbaric murder of pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh on February 3, suggesting Saraiva could have been involved. Possible link: Nero Saraiva (centre), 28, is thought have risen in the ranks to become one of ISIS's most senior fighters and working side-by-side with Jihadi John . Barbaric: The flames reach the cage holding the helpless Jordanian pilot and it is later flattened by a bulldozer . Saraiva is one of five young men from London who all moved from their native Portugal to London, where they converted to Islam before adopting extremist views and travelling to Syria to join the terrorist network's ranks. A source at Portugal's Polícia Judiciária told the Evening Standard the country's National Unit of Counter-Terrorism was investigating Saraiva in connection with the videos and other activities. 'There are a lot of suspects under surveillance, Nero Saraiva is among them,' they told the paper. 'The European authorities have asked Portugal for their collaboration on the investigation,  particularly with those suspects with links to the UK.' The five men, including Saraiva, who lived in Leyton and Walthamstow, have long been on the radar of intelligence officials - who believe the group plays a vital role in the production and dissemination of the sick beheading videos featuring Jihadi John. Ringleader Saraiva, a father-of-four and former engineering student, was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012. He has a five-year-old son in the UK, who he has never supported financially, and is thought to have lived in Britain the longest, having appeared on the electoral roll in 2003. Last year his name was linked to an alleged terrorist plot in east Africa involving al-Qaeda affiliate group al-Shabaab. He is a known supporter of hate-preaching cleric, Abu Hamza, recently jailed for life in America for terrorism offences. In July 2014 - 39 days before James Foley became the first Western hostage to be murdered - he posted a message on Twitter indicating he had advance knowledge of the American journalist's grisly fate.

Saraiva, a father-of-four and former engineering student, was the first of the group to travel to Syria in the summer of 2012 . Grief: Anwar al-Tarawneh, the wife of Moaz al Kasasbeh, appeared at a protest in Amman, Jordan calling for his release before his death . Saraiva, who lived in a one-bedroom council flat in Walthamstow for three years, tweeted: 'Message to America, the Islamic State is making a new movie. Thank u for the actors.' Just over a month later James Foley was beheaded in a YouTube video entitled A Message To America. The group Mu'assasat al-Furqan is responsible for both the James Foley and Muath al-Kasaesbeh murder videos, according to the Evening Standard. European security officials believe Saraiva and his London cell are responsible for the filming and dissemination of the series of sickening beheading videos, including the execution of British hostages Alan Henning and David Haines. All five of the football-playing jihadists showed a passion for football in their younger years, and after moving to the UK, would often meet in a Portuguese-run café in London to watch matches. It is still unclear how they were radicalised in Britain but the borough of Waltham Forest where they lived is known to be home to a number of Islamic extremists. All five of the men had family roots in Portugal's former African colonies and some were brought up to be Christians.

"On the whole us Brits have got a bad reputation overseas. Whether it's lounging by the pool shouting up to your friend's hotel balcony, spilling beer like it's water or lunging at anything in a skirt,   being in a foreign clime becomes like a passport to loose behaviour. From Lanzarote to Majorca and Thailand to Beirut, our strange whims, afternoon drinking sessions and often total disregard for local custom means we stick out like a sore thumb. Unsurprisingly then, a study by TravelSupermarket  found that out of all  nationalities, Britons think their fellow countrymen are the most likely to stand out as tourists  on holiday, Germans came a close second. Over a third felt they would have a more 'authentic' travel experience if they blended in better with the locals. For those who care, here are a few obvious pointers of where you are going wrong. Scroll down for video . There's little wonder us Brits have got a bad rep overseas - we stick out like a sore thumb. If there's one thing we're not, it's inconspicuous... Keep your clothes on . In general, unless  on a beach, this is a good code to live by. Who wants to see nipples at lunch? Last year the German newspaper Bild ran an article dissecting the atypical Brit abroad. It was titled 'Bild explains the English Patients (of Majorca)' and one of the charges  leveled against us was something called 'Prince Harry syndrome', or the 'pathological need constantly to undress'. They also described British women as  suffering from 'underwear amnesia'. Remember where you left your underwear, be mindful of local customs and cultures (especially around places of worship) and (to help you with the point below)  keep your shirt on where possible. Brits will shed their clothes at the merest hint of a sunny day, so expect copious amount of fleshy mounds once they hit the beach. German newspaper Bild has described this phenomenon as 'the pathological need constantly to undress', which seems a little harsh . Wear sun cream . Nothing says I'm a Brit abroad like sun burn. Even if you haven't seen sunshine for the best part of a year it's best to pretend you know what you are doing. A  Superdrug poll found that nine million Brits get sunburn every single time they go abroad and one in ten admit to burning twice on the same holiday. Inflamed, beetroot skin is not only horribly uncomfortable but it makes you look like a complete rookie. Sunscreen is cheating! Lobster pink skin never has been, and never will be, a good look, yet many Brits still refuse to cover up or slap on the sunscreen . Tip: suncream can often be bought more cheaply in the country you are travelling to so resist the £10 bottle at the airport and buy some at the nearest supermarket. Don't be a yob . The international community views Brits as a loud, abrasive, heckling bunch of hee-hawing numpties. We don't bother to learn the local language, preferring to speak English increasingly loudly and slowly until we get what we want. Being polite goes a long way. Learn some local words, chat to your waiter, hotel manager or fellow guests and always be courteous. As your mother told you, manners cost nothing. Drinking . Almost as obligatory as showing your boarding pass to cabin crew is the British airport drink, or ten. Never mind that it's 8am and the Heathrow Wetherspoons hasn't opened. You'll find a drink and, probably, won't stop until you return home. If there's one thing Brits abroad are good at, it's drinking. By the pool, in the pool, or even down a tube, we'll guzzle just about anything with a minimum 40% alcohol content . Studies show that half of British holidaymakers drink alcohol every day on summer breaks - and one in three  admit to boozing in the departure lounge. It's pretty likely that even Brits trekking to Machu Picchu will be weighed down by vodka. Save yourself a horrible injury, a misjudged fling or jail time and sip rather than guzzle. Around half of Brits admit to drinking every day while they're on holiday, and one in three admit to boozing in the departure lounge. It's OK to take a day or two off, promise... Union Jacks . Just in case locals  missed you doing any, or all, of the above, you can be sure to let them know of your proud heritage by splattering Union Jacks across all your holiday gear. This is the perfect way to show other what a hopeless foreigner you are, how ripe you are for pick pockets and opportunistic salesmen. Worst offending items  are towels, shorts, hats and bags. Just leave it behind or, better yet, don't buy it in the first place. You'll never guess where I'm from? Brits love to advertise their heritage via tacky Union Jack holiday accessories. Just put it away, please! Ridiculous hats . Brits abroad and silly hats are like moths to a flame. Sombreros, handkerchiefs tied into knots and promotional pork pie headgear might protect your head from the sun but they do nothing for your image. Fry ups . If there is a time and a place for a fry up it is not while watching the sun rise behind the French Riviera or after a night sipping cocktails on a remote Malaysian island. If we're not on the sauce, we're probably sloshing it all over a hearty Great British fry up. Our ability to chow down a hot plate of bacon, sausages and eggs in sweltering heat is the stuff that legends are made of . It's almost impressive how diligently Brits abroad force down a hot plate of beans, sausages, eggs and bacon even in sweltering 30 degree heat. A international survey by hotels.com revealed the full English fry up to be the world's favourite breakfast. It also found that a quarter of us take teabags, brown sauce and even bacon with us when travelling. Adventurous Brits love to sample the local cuisine when they're abroad. Did you know that McDonald's now has restaurants in 120 countries around the world? The possibilities are mind-blowing... But part of visiting another country means trying new things, food included, and breakfast is the perfect place to start. Socks and sandals . Just because Bruce Willis and David Beckham have been spotted sporting this confusing sartorial statement doesn't give you a right to. It's not ironic, it's not practical and it will give you sock marks. There is simply no excuse for pairing socks with your sandals. Ever. Britain has a rich history of sock and sandal wearing, mostly from those north of 50, and last summer there was  a moment when fashion commentators tried to persuade us it was a good look after Prada and Louis Vuitton catwalks showed them together. Still, there's no quicker way to look like a very British idiot abroad than by wearing them.","A third of Brits think they would have a better holiday if they blended in .
From Lanzarote to Majorca and Thailand Brits stick out like sore thumbs .
Drinking,  Union Jack towels and  getting naked all contribute to stereotypes .
As does wearing silly hats or socks and sandals while on holiday abroad ."
"A truck driver has described the moment he spotted a suspected trafficking victim peeking out of a van before a man got in and the vehicle 'started rocking'. Kevin Kimmel was parked at a gas station in Richmond, Virginia, on January 6 when he witnessed the alleged incident and called police. His call led to an FBI investigation after officers found a dishevelled 20-year-old woman who appeared to be malnourished with puncture wounds in her feet, according to a police report. An Iowa couple, Aldair Hodza, 36, and Laura Sorensen, 31, have been charged with abducting the woman and forcing her into an online prostitution scheme. Court documents allege Hodza tortured the woman by burning her with keys heated over a stove, and driving nails into her feet with a hammer. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Made the call: Kevin Kimmel (pictured) called 911 when he saw a terrified woman through the blacked-out curtains of a van in a truck stop in Richmond, VA. His call led to police finding a suspected sex trafficking victim . Arrested: Iowa couple Aldair Hodza, 36, and Laura Sorensen, 31, have been charged with sex trafficking . Recounting the moment he spotted the woman, Kimmel told WTVR: 'I saw what looked like a young girl looking out the window, the black drapes didn't make it look like a family's RV, you know. 'I saw a guy come up and knock on the door then go inside the Pilot [gas station] then quickly come back and knocked again. 'All of a sudden, the thing was rocking and rolling.' The alleged victim told sheriff's deputies she was captured on Christmas Eve and forced into prostitution during a trip from Iowa to Virginia. She added that Sorensen and Hodza threatened to kill her family if she spoke out, The News & Advance reported. Officers found pictures of the alleged victim naked, bound and gagged. Horrific: Police said the alleged victim had puncture wounds in her feet and burn marks on her abdomen . Other pictures showed somebody spraynig Clorox bleach into an open wound. Federal documents state the alleged victim was starved and denied water. Sorensen allegedly sourced clients via the online market Craigslist, the site adds. The couple are expected to appear in a Virginia Magistrate's court on Monday. According to Iowa authorities, the woman was not reported missing. Kimmel said he was shocked when he heard the details of the investigation that his call led to. 'When I saw the young girl's face, I said that's not going to happen, I've got daughters and granddaughters,' he told WTVR. 'I only learned the gruesome details through the news,' Kimmel told the station. 'I'm just happy I helped her.'","Kevin Kimmel called 911 after he saw woman peek out blacked-out van .

"An Al Jazeera journalist who spent more than a year behind bars in Egypt on terror-related charges has been joyfully reunited with his family. Pictures emerged on Twitter of Baher Mohammed smiling happily with his wife, Jehan, and their three children. Mohammed's colleague tweeted a picture of them together with the message 'family reunion after 411 days', while another image of them was simply captioned 'finally!' Mohammed's wife had given birth to their third child, Haroon, without her husband by her side. Scroll down for video . Pictures emerged on Twitter of Baher Mohammed smiling happily with his wife, Jehan, and their three children . Mohammed had been held in prison for 411 days on terror-related charges denounced as a sham by rights groups . Mohammed was released on Friday, along with his Canadian colleague Mohamed Fahmy. They had been held on terror related charges denounced as a sham by rights groups and the international community. They have been released pending a retrial. Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney welcomed the decision by an Egyptian judge to order their release on bail. The wife of Hollywood actor George Clooney said she was 'encouraged' by the ruling in relation to Fahmy, who she had acted for, and Mohammed. The pair were sentenced with their colleague Peter Greste to at least seven years in prison. Greste was freed two weeks ago and deported to his home-country, Australia. Now that he is out, Fahmy's next court hearing is due on February 23 and he has to check in at a police station every day until then. Amal Clooney, the international human rights lawyer, is representing the journalists . Thursday's decision indicated the court was moving ahead with a retrial of Fahmy and Mohammed, but several scenarios are possible. The court could eventually throw out the case, acquit them, convict them but sentence them to time served, or impose more prison time, with the possibility of a pardon from President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. Like Greste, Fahmy could also be deported but prospects for Baher, who only has Egyptian citizenship, remain murkier. Cairo has signaled it wants to resolve the case and end the criticism ahead of a major economic conference next month to drum up international investment. Egypt's staggered parliamentary elections are also due to start in March. The three journalists, who worked for Al-Jazeera's English-language channel, were arrested in December 2013 and accused of belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood, which was branded a terrorist organization after the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi earlier that year. Since the ouster, Egypt has been cracking down heavily on Morsi's supporters, and the journalists were accused of being mouthpieces for the Brotherhood and falsifying footage to suggest that Egypt faces civil war. They rejected the charges against them, saying they were simply reporting the news. They were convicted by a lower court on terrorism-related charges and sentenced to at least seven years in prison. The Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, said in ordering a retrial that their conviction was based on 'flawed evidence' and that the trial was marred by violations of the defendants' rights, according to details of its ruling made public this week. Al-Jazeera called the decision 'a small step in the right direction' but said the court should dismiss 'this absurd case' and release both journalists unconditionally.' Though el-Sissi had rejected calls from the United States and other Western governments to pardon or commute the sentences, he acknowledged last July that the heavy sentences had a 'very negative' impact on Egypt's reputation and that he wished they had never been put on trial. The journalists and their families say they were caught in the bitter feud between Egypt and Qatar, the Gulf nation that owns Al-Jazeera and a main Brotherhood backer. Egypt's ties with Qatar have since thawed. Baher Mohamed (left) and Mohamed Fahy (centre) and Australian journalist Peter Greste (right) on the first day of their trial . Greste was deported under a hastily drawn up law allowing el-Sissi to deport foreigners who are on trial or have been convicted. Fahmy has applied for deportation under the same law, which is confusing and unclear. One defense lawyer, Khaled Abou Bakr, noted that Greste remains listed as a defendant in the case even after his deportation. Fahmy has said that security officials pushed him into giving up his Egyptian citizenship so he could be sent to Canada, where he also has citizenship. 'I didn't ask to give up my Egyptian citizenship. I was asked to do so,' Fahmy said in the courtroom Thursday, wearing a sling on a shoulder that has been injured since before his arrest and only worsened in detention. He said security officials had asked him to do so because the case had become a 'nightmare' for Egypt. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday that his government was in touch with officials in Egypt 'at all levels, including on my level,' and was continuing to press for Fahmy's freedom. 'We do remain optimistic that this case will be resolved,' Harper said. Mohammed and 11 other defendants in the case - mostly students accused of being Brotherhood members - were ordered released without bail. From Australia, Greste expressed his joy but said it was too soon for unreserved celebrations. 'The trial is ongoing, and nobody has yet been acquitted,' Greste said in a statement. 'I'm looking forward to the day when the court declares all of us innocent of the charges. Then the party will really begin.' December 29 2013:  Mohamed Fahmy, Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste are arrested alongside a handful of others in Cairo . January 29 2014: The men are charged with spreading false news, belonging to a terrorist organisation and operating without a permit .

"A Virginia Tech student has pleaded guilty to strangling her friend to death with a cord amid speculation the pair were experimenting sexually. Former cadet Jessica Ewing, 24, was charged with murder last February after police found the dead naked body of Samanata Shrestha wrapped in a sleeping bag in the back of a 2004 Mercedes. Shrestha, a 21-year-old biology student destined for medical school, had not been seen for three days after cooking dinner for Ewing, a fellow student, at her apartment on February 7, 2014. On Thursday, two months before the jury trial begins, Ewing entered an Alford guilty plea which acknowledges that there is enough evidence to make a case against her while maintaining innocence. She also pleaded guilty to altering, transporting and concealing a dead body. Scroll down for video . Pleaded guilty: Jessica Ewing (left) pleaded guilty to murdering fellow Virginia Tech student 21-year-old Samanata Shrestha (right) last February after they had dinner together. Shrestha was found naked in a car . Ewing, who was the top female in Virginia Tech's Corps of Cadets, had only met Shrestha three times before, a friend told a preliminary hearing last year. Shrestha's boyfriend Scot Masselli told the same judge he knew the pair had kissed, and he speculated that Shrestha may have been experimenting with her sexuality. Summarizing the case on Thursday, prosecution recounted texts and diary entries composed by Ewing which alluded to death and a 'worrisome' act, The Roanoke Times reported. At 3am on the day of Shrestha's death, Ewing sent a text to her friend Mary Meinhart which read: 'tomorrow night is worrisome... I can't stop this idea, it slowly creeped it's way to consume my black heart. I want to... let someone else decide, but ive [sic] already etched it in history.' Confused, her friend asked her to clarify what she meant, and Ewing responded: 'just nonsense.' In her journal seized by authorities, Ewing allegedly wrote: 'What the hell is my future going to be? an eternity in prison? Death penalty **** off on insanity, mental what the f*** have you done for that god d***** girl.' See more at WDBJ7 . Questions: Shrestha's boyfriend Scot Masselli (pictured together) told the court the girls had kissed . Mourning: The victim's family and boyfriend sat in court to watch Ewing enter a guilty plea on Thursday . Another entry said: 'Gasoline — must be done tonight!' And one references moving a body, as well as he co-suspect Keifer Kyle Brown: 'Damn Keifer some friend he f*** **** won't even help me move a g**-****** body in the middle of the [undecipherable], friendship test failed.' The court heard Keifer Kyle Brown eventually helped Ewing put Shrestha in the back of her own car that night. The next day, according to prosecution, Ewing went to her regular Bible study class and told the host, a student named Erika Holub, that she murdered somebody. 'They were an EMT. They were a good person,' she allegedly told Holub. Shrestha worked part-time as an Emergency Medical Technician. Ewing allegedly told the head of her Bible study group she killed someone the day after Shrestha's death . Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Patrick Jensen told the court Ewing is suspected of 'ligature strangulation', which involves the use of a cord-like object. Montgomery County Commonwealth's Attorney Mary Pettitt said: 'Ligature strangulation is a very deliberate and personal method of murder. 'After eating the dinner that the victim prepared for her, Ewing pulled the ligature as Shrestha fought for her life, clawing at the ligature around her neck.' Ewing's jury trial begins on April 21. She has been in jail since her arrest on February 10, where she will remain until trial.","Jessica Ewing pleaded guilty to murdering Samanata Shrestha, 21 .

"A vast art and jewellery collection amassed by actress Lauren Bacall, who died in August 2014, is to go under the hammer. The collection will be previewed in London from 15th until the 19th February, before it is auctioned at Bonhams New York on 31 March and 1 April. But the British capital is just one stop on an international tour that will take in Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Paris and New York. Scroll down for video . An huge collection assembled by acclaimed actress of stage and screen, Lauren Bacall, who died in August 2014, is to go under the hammer at Bonhams in New York . Many of the pieces come from three of Bacall's residences, including the LA home she shared with her first husband, Humphrey Bogart. Others come from  her country home in Amagansett and her New York apartment, which she shared with second husband, Jason Robards until 1969. Highlights include six bronze maquettes by Henry Moore, Britain’s greatest 20th century sculptor and one of Bacall’s favourite artists. Bacall’s admiration for Moore began in the 1950s while she was living in Los Angeles. After finally meeting the sculptor at his studio in 1975, she wrote: 'It was and will be ever a high point of my life ... [it was the] realization of a dream.' Also included in the highlight exhibition are bronze sculptures by noted American artist, Robert Graham, whose works fascinated Bacall, and who was married to her close friend, Anjelica Huston. She apparently referred to the three sculptures, all of which depict nude women in various poses, as her 'girls'. A Bonham's staff member looks over Robert Graham's 'Christine' (1993) sculptures during the Lauren Bacall Collection sale at Bonham's in London. The artwork is expected fetch £37,000 - £51,000 at an auction in New York on 31 March . An enamel and 18K gold bracelet by Jean Schlumberger makes up the robust collection . Some of the actress’s best loved jewellery pieces, created by designer Jean Schlumberger, will be on display . Contemporary and modern prints by David Hockney, Jim Dine, Richard Avedon, Henry Moore and John James Audubon, as well as paintings by the legendary Sir Noel Coward, Aaron Shikler, Georges Wakhevitch are also for sale. Equally beautifully made is the jewellery collection, some of which was created by designer, Jean Schlumberger. Particularly striking is an  18-carat yellow gold, enamel, cultured pearl, and rose diamond Mogul-inspired camel brooch by British jeweller, Elizabeth Gage. Unusually, the piece is accompanied by the original drawing and handwritten correspondence between Gage and Bacall. A patinated bronze figure of Humphrey Bogart  forms part of the late Lauren Bacall's estate . John James Audubon's 'American White Pelican' artwork  is expected fetch £25,000-£39,000 . A turquoise enamel and 18K gold necklace belonging to Lauren Bacall will go under the hammer . Speaking about the tour, a spokesperson for Bonhams said: 'Bonhams is delighted to share with the public a rare insight into the world of Lauren Bacall, the accomplished collector. 'Her collection is a truly a reflection of her extraordinary taste and remarkable life.’ Lauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske in Brooklyn in 1924. She attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, alongside Kirk Douglas, and supported herself by working as an usherette and a model. It was her work in modeling which led to her breakthrough: she was spotted by Diana Vreeland, then fashion editor of Harper’s Bazaar. Bacall soon appeared on the cover of Harper's, catching the attention of the celebrated director, Howard Hawks shortly after. An amethyst, turquoise and diamond ring is expected to fetch £3,850 - £5,780 . Hawks changed Bacall’s name to Lauren and took a chance on the inexperienced starlet, casting her in his adaption of Hemingway’s tale, To Have and Have Not. 19-year-old Bacall was apparently so nervous, her head shook involuntarily, so she tilted her chin down to steady herself, with the result being that she looked up  at the camera. Her unusual style of delivery, combined with the script’s many innuendos, were to prove a winning formula. The public was hooked on the chemistry between Bacall and Bogart - and the studio took advantage, casting them together in Key Largo, The Big Sleep and Dark Passage. The couple married in 1945, had two children, and stayed together until Bogart’s death in 1957. Bacall later had a third child with her second husband, Jason Robards. Lauren Bacall, pictured in the 1950s, attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, alongside Kirk Douglas, and supported herself by working as an usherette and a model . Bacall also became an accomplished stage actress, receiving critical acclaim for her work in Cactus Flower, Applause, and Woman of the Year. Nevertheless, she continued to make films and eventually appeared in more than 30, among them How to Marry a Millionaire and Murder on the Orient Express. The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996) - of which Barbra Streisand was director, producer and star - earned Bacall a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award nomination. In 2009, Bacall collected an Oscar in recognition of 'her central place in the golden age of motion pictures.'

They must get 75 per cent right to pass. Examples of questions include: 'What important event happened in England in 1066?' and 'What is the capital city of the UK?'. The test has been criticised in the past as 'unfit for purpose' as it concentrates too heavily on history and not enough on practical knowledge. Immigration expert Dr Thom Brooks, of Durham University, criticised it for not mentioning practical issues such as how to register with a GP or how to ring for an ambulance. Public Lending Right, which organises payment for authors whose books are lent by libraries, found it was the most borrowed book in London. Elsewhere, more predictable books were popular; Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown's latest novel Inferno was the most borrowed across the UK.","UK citizenship test guide among the most borrowed library books in 2014 .

"The bodies of two more women have been connected to alleged serial killer Darren Vann (pictured in an undated mugshot) The bodies of two women found in an abandoned  building have been linked to an alleged serial killer charged in the strangulation deaths of two other women. The coroner on Friday morning said DNA had identified the bodies found on October 19 last year as 53-year-old Sonya Billingsley and 27-year-old Tanya Gatlin. Both were from Gary, Indiana. Darren Vann is charged with murder in the deaths of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy and 35-year-old Anith Jones. The 43-year-old Vann has pleaded not guilty. Police said Hardy was killed at a Hammond motel and that Vann led investigators to the bodies of Jones and five other women inside abandoned houses in Gary. No other charges have yet been filed. Vann, a convicted sex offender, was arrested on October 18 last year and charged with the strangulation death of Hardy. Her body was found the day before in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, 20 miles southeast of Chicago. On October 22, he also was charged in the death of 35-year-old Anith Jones of Merrillville, Indiana, whose body was found in an abandoned house  in Gary. Five more bodies were found on October 19 in other homes, said Hammond Police Chief John Doughty, who identified two of the women as Gary residents Teaira Batey, 28, and Kristine Williams, 36. Some of the bodies have been difficult to identify because they were largely skeletonized so other markings, like identifying scars or birthmarks, weren't present. Members of 17 different families have called the coroner's office inquiring about the bodies, and one call led to DNA tests on the third unidentified victim, Frey said in October. Victim: Vann has been charged in the death of Afrikka Hardy, top left, whose body was found on October 17, 2014 in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana. The death of 53-year-old Sonya Billingsley (top right) was also linked to Vann on Friday . The bodies of Teaira Bately (left) and Anith Jones (right) were found in October in Indiana. Vann has been charged with the death of Ms Jones but not Bately - despite leading them to her body . Investigators in Indiana and Texas, where Vann also lived, have been poring over cold case files and missing person reports to determine if there are more victims. Inquiries were also being made in Illinois. Hammond Police discovered information indicating Vann may have been in various communities just across the state line  in Cook County between the day Hardy's body was found and when Vann was arrested. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart confirmed that 'through technology' investigators believed that Vann was in the area of Hazelcrest, Markham and Harvey then, but he wouldn't elaborate. A law enforcement official close to the investigation said  cellphone records tracked Vann's phone through the region. The official, who was not authorized to speak about the investigation and would only discuss it anonymously, said investigators were also informed Vann told detectives that after a killing he would visit abandoned buildings where he'd stashed previous victims to ensure bodies had not been discovered. Vann was convicted in 2009 of raping a woman in his Austin, Texas, apartment. He was released from prison in 2013 and moved back to Indiana. Before that conviction, he served a year in prison in Indiana after he grabbed a Gary woman in a chokehold in 2004, doused her with gasoline and threatened to set her on fire. In both cases, the charges against Vann were reduced in plea bargains, and Texas officials deemed him a low risk for violence. Vann registered as a sex offender in Indiana and police made a routine check in September that he lived at the address he provided. Sherriff Buncich said he wished registered sex offenders, like Vann, could be monitored more closely than they are but that budgetary and legal constraints make that difficult.

"Dash-camera footage has revealed cops' dramatic high speed chase to catch the killer of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle - before he surrendered and officers swooped on him. Prosecutors showed the never-before-seen video to the jury on Thursday in the murder trial of ex-Marine Eddie Ray Routh, who is accused of killing Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, in 2013. The video shows Routh driving Kyle's truck, which he stole after shooting the men in their backs at a Texas driving range, before speeding away from police officers, who trail him for nine minutes. Even when a police car slams into the side of the truck in a bid to stop it, Routh continues driving. Scroll down for videos . Dramatic: Dash-camera video shown in court on Thursday shows Eddie Routh fleeing from cops in a truck he stole from Chris Kyle after shooting him and his friend dead in Texas in 2013 . Surrender: Routh eventually stops and surrenders and climbs out of the car with his hands raised . But as he nears Interstate 35E and Interstate 20, he is forced to stop due to a technical difficulty with the truck - and he can be seen emerging from the vehicle with his hands raised. Six cops immediately swoop on him - with more in pursuit - and he gets on to the ground, where he is handcuffed. The dramatic footage was shown in the court on Thursday, along with audio from police officers' body cameras. His attorney has suggested Routh, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was in a psychotic state and thought Kyle and Littlefield were going to kill him. Body camera footage also shows police officers pleading with Routh to get out of the truck for 30 minutes before the chase. One officer records Routh sitting in his car, as he speaks to him through the window. 'Is the apocalypse upon us right now?' Routh can be heard saying on the body-cam recording. Swoop: As Routh gets to the ground, police officers near him with weapons drawn prepare to take him into custody . Pounce: Officers can be seen running towards Routh as he gets down on the road . The 27-year-old also talked about voodoo, hell, and the apocalypse, and wondered aloud to the cops: 'I don't know if I'm going insane.' At different points in the video, Routh made comments including, 'I didn't sleep a wink last night at all,' 'I don't know if I'm going insane,' and, 'Is this about hell walking on earth right now?' In court, Lt Michael Smith testified that Routh said something to the nature of: 'He had taken a couple souls and he had some more souls to take.' 'Everything's just happening so fast...I don't know if I'm going insane,' he told the police officer. 'That's what we need to figure out,' the officer responded. 'We need to figure out what you're thinking and then see if it's right or wrong.' He eventually sped away from officers. Routh's defense attorney R. Shay Isham argued that his client's ravings served as proof that he was out of touch with reality that night - but prosecutors have argued that the fact he drove away, and had earlier stopped at a Taco Bell drive-thru for two burritos, showed he was of right mind. Accused: Attorneys for Eddie Ray Routh, pictured center in court in Stephenville, Texas on Thursday, say he killed the men while suffering from post traumatic stress disorder after serving abroad . Gunned down: Former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, left, and his friend Chad Littlefield, right, were killed . Devastated: Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle's widow, wipes her eyes during her testimony on Wednesday . As the videos played in court on Thursday, Littlefield's relatives sobbed, while Kyle's widow Taya shook her head, ABC reported. Routh has pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charges on the basis that he is mentally ill, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. There is not a question over whether or not he shot the men dead - rather, the trial is focused on whether or not he was of fit mind at the time of the murders. Routh was a small arms technician who served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti before leaving the Marines in 2010. If convicted of capital murder, he faces life in prison without parole. The case has gained national attention due to 'American Sniper', the movie starring Bradley Cooper and based on Kyle's memoir, was released to critical acclaim.","On Thursday the jury in Eddie Routh's murder trial watched footage of police chasing him after he fled the scene of the shooting in 2013 .

"The Islamic State terror group has issued battlefield guidance to its commanders on how to stay alive and boost morale among the jiadhi fighters. The move follows the loss of half of the ISIS leadership after sustained air strikes from Coalition planes. Guidance published in the terrorist group's magazine Dabiq IS leaders are told: don't stand out from the ordinary fighters in case of becoming a target for the enemy; not to travel more than three to a vehicle; always wear body armour and a helmet; use code words to communicate; and use suicide attackers to raise morale. Militants: Guidance published in the terrorist group's magazine Dabiq tells commanders how to stay alive and boost morale among the jiadhi fighters . The 30-point plan is published under the name of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, an ISIS founding jihadist who was killed by an American raid on his house in Iraq in 2010. But its prominent publication in the ISIS house magazine yesterday is timely and is aimed at halting the high attrition rate among the IS leadership . Death toll: The prominent publication of the battlefield guidance is timely and is aimed at halting the high attrition rate among the ISIS leadership . According to recent reports ISIS' leadership in Syria and Iraq has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Coalition warplanes and drones have killed more than 6,000 fighters since September, including more than half the militants serving on ISIS' ruling council, US Secretary John Kerry has claimed. Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small. Many of the commanders have been killed while travelling in convoys between Syria and Iraq. Baghdadi has not been seen in public since July and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes. The likelihood, however, is that Baghdadi has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months. Other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq that remain under ISIS' control. This forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead, or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if ISIS' rivals on the ground. Running scared: The battlefield advice is also peppered with signs of paranoia about Coalition surveillance and espionage and warns commanders to watch for spies living among its fighters . Point 7 of the 30-point plan for ISIS leaders says 'Beware of standing out from others by way of the vehicle that you ride or the clothes that you wear..' And point 11 warns: 'Don't neglect to take what you can of equipment, such as armor and helmets. Doing so is not cowardice, for Allah's Messenger (sallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam), the bravest of all people, had armor.' Number 13 advices: 'You should not have more than three fighters in any car, unless there's an overriding benefit in doing so.' 'The leader should establish a secure, elaborate method of communication between each of the detachments, and establish code words for them to use when communicating, and slogans to shout when they're fighting.' But at the same time the commanders are warned that even in the face of air attacks they are not to 'use security as an excuse' to spend too much time away from the battlefield. Leader: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been seen in public since July and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes . Dead: Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left), a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. Another former member of Saddam Hussein's army turned ISIS commander, Abu Musa al-Alwani (right), has also been killed . Killer: The ISIS militant known as Jihadi John is still free to commit barbaric slaughter, however . Point 5 warns: 'And beware of using security as an excuse, thereby ensuring your personal security and neglecting your subjects in the process, for what a terrible leader you would then be!' The advice is also peppered with signs of paranoia about Coalition surveillance and espionage and warns commanders to watch for spies living among its fighters. It warns: 'And be on guard against your enemy at all times so that he doesn't: a. Pounce on you from near. b. Assault you from far. c. Ambush you when you're inattentive. d. Or follow you when you're returning home.' The guidance encourages the punishment of fighters who disobey orders or criticise the leadership: 'Punish those who do wrong for their actions, even if by boycotting them, since it's permissible for a leader to punish those who disobey his orders.' 'If you don't do so, those who perform well will begin to slack, and those who do wrong will become emboldened, things will get worse and your work will be ruined.' Brutal: This latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants' trademark slick production effects and features a light-skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous 'Jihadi John' Sick: The killer is seen ranting in Arabic behind the doomed prisoner before the HD footage is edited into slow-motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun, thrown to him by somebody off camera . Earlier this week Islamic State terrorists released a horrific new video showing the execution of a prisoner killed with a pump-action shotgun. This latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants' trademark slick production effects and features a light-skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous 'Jihadi John'. The prisoner, believed to be a Syrian soldier captured by ISIS, is forced to wear the same kind of orange jumpsuit worn by Western hostages before they are savagely beheaded by the terror group. The killer is seen ranting in Arabic behind the doomed prisoner before the HD footage is edited into slow-motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun, thrown to him by somebody off camera. Seconds later he fires a single round into the back of the victim's head causing horrific injuries far too graphic to publish. The film rewinds and replays the moment of impact in gruesome detail several times, before cutting to a shot of a pool of blood and the prisoner's dead body. Islamic State hostage John Cantlie has told his family to 'let him go' and 'get on with their lives' - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series. In an article released last night for the terror group's magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their 'tireless efforts' campaigning for his release. However, he adds: 'Let it go. Leave it be and get on with your lives, all of you'. In an article released last night for the terror group's magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their 'tireless efforts' campaigning for his release . Referring to an interview given by his partner, the photo journalist says: 'That was my fiancee, whom I hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on. 'What can the remnants of one family, smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning, be expected to do by themselves.' In the article, Cantlie, 44, has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against Islamic State, claiming that 'every bomb dropped in Syria or Iraq serves as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State'. Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago (pictured) was 'the last in this series' The magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh by IS fighters and claims by the group that US aid worker hostage Kayla Mueller had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the Jordanian's shocking murder. There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley. Eight international hostages, including two Britons, have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders Cantlie has been used for a series of nine expertly-made propaganda videos by IS.","Terror group has published safety advise for its commanders to follow .

"The four-year-old daughter of NFL Cincinnati Bengals tackle Devon Still, 25, walked the runway on Thursday for New York Fashion Week. Devon posted a message for his fans on Instagram in June revealing the news that Leah was battling cancer. Now looking healthier and sporting a cool short hairstyle, Leah made her way down the runway for the Levi's Kids fashion show with Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off' playing in the background. Scroll down for video . Little fashion star: Leah made her way down the runway for the Levi's Kids fashion show with Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off' playing in the background . His little champion: NFL player Devon Still and daughter , prepare backstage at the Nike Levi's Kids fashion show where Leah walked the runway . Tough year: Devon posted a message for his fans on Instagram in June revealing the tragic news that Leah was battling cancer . Fox reports that Devon has been keeping people up to date on Leah's progress via his social media accounts. On February 7, just days before the fashion show, Devon announced that Leah was released from the hospital after eight days of receiving cancer treatment. Despite being in and out of the hospital, Leah is doing her best to live her life like any other kid. Leah watched her dad play against the Browns during the 2014-2015 seasons which was a big highlight of the year but she also got a very special gift. The Bengals presented a $1.3 million check in her name to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Devon Still revealed last month that despite his expectations, his 4-year-old daughter's battle with cancer continues. Leah, who has neuroblastoma, underwent testing last month to measure her progress. Still was expecting the doctor to declare Leah cancer-free, but that was not the case. In the audience: Hoda Kotb and football player Devon Still attend the Nike Levi's Kids fashion show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2015 at The Salon at Lincoln Center on February 12 . Leah's battle with cancer has touched millions across the country after Devon announced in June on Instagram that she was battling pediatric cancer . 'I wanted to hear so bad that my daughter's cancer was gone and when I didn't it hurt me bad,' Still wrote in the post. He continued in the post writing that he and his family would 'keep faith and keep fighting no matter what.' In September, the Bengals cut Still from the team - though they then resigned him to the practice squad so that he would have health insurance - and a $6,300-a-week salary from the team. Days before Still delivered the sad news, he posted a photo of Leah writing that he was 'praying [doctors] come back and tell me my daughter has no more cancer cells in her body.' Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma in June and has since undergone a series of surgeries. Strutting all over cancer!: Hoda Kotb, Leah Still and Devon Still backstage at Nike/Levi's Kids during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Fall 2015 at The Salon at Lincoln Center on February 12 . In September, Leah underwent surgery to remove a tumor, she went through rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, and in November she had stem cell replacement therapy. Leah's battle with the disease gained national attention early in 2014 when the Bengals cut Still from the roster only to sign him again once they learned of Leah's illness, ABC reports. Since Leah's battle with cancer began, Still has documented her journey with the disease on social networks. He created the hashtag #LeahStrong, enlisting the support of the public. When chemotherapy caused the 4-year-old to lose her hair, Still cut off his own hair in an act of support for Leah. The 25-year-old has raised more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research through appearances and jersey sales, according to WCPO. Trooper: Despite being in an out of the hospital Leah has maintained her joyful nature .","The four-year-old daughter of NFL Cincinnati Bengals tackle Devon Still, 25, walked the runway on Thursday for New York Fashion Week for Levi's Kids .

"An angry owl who viciously swooped down on four unsuspecting joggers in an Oregon park has inspired a host of bright yellow signs to warn passers-by of his impending attack. The quirky warning signs initially debuted as a gag on  The Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC after she got word of the attacks and had the signs mocked up. Maddow jokingly suggested that the city of Salem should post the vivid sign using the iconic pedestrian stick figure running from an owl which has its claws extended. But the signs were no laughing matter to Salem City council after they received them from MSNBC   as they have decided to adopt them. Scroll down for video . Installation: John Kleeman, Parks Operations Supervisor for Salem, Oregon installs signs at Bush's Pasture Park on Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015, warning visitors of the recent owl attacks . Beware: The city of Salem signs show  the iconic pedestrian stick figure running from an owl which has its claws extended . The City of Salem is now posting the unusual signs near a park and popular jogging hill, warning people that the angry owl could stage a silent attack and swoop  at any moment. At least four people have already been scratched by the aggressive owl over the past couple of months near Bush's Pasture Park and Soap Box Derby hill, according to KGW.com . One jogger said the bird swiped his longtime running cap off his head and nicked his scalp. Another jogger, a surgeon, said the owl hit him twice in Bush's Pasture Park in Salem, and it was so hard that he thought he was having a stroke or an aneurysm. But after the surgeon saw Maddow's sign on TV he decided to create T-shirts of it and is now selling them online. Mark Becktel, parks and transportation services manager, said the city secured rights to reproduce the sign and is posting 20 of them. 'It's just making people aware that there's an owl there that for whatever reason swoops down and goes after people's hats,' he said. Suggestion: Rachel Maddow jokingly suggested that the city of Salem should post the vivid sign using the iconic pedestrian stick figure running from an owl which has its claws extended . Tweet: Officials from the City of Salem tweeted 'It started off as a gag on the Rachel Maddow show but the city plans to install these signs' Yet, the attacks have become so well known that the owl even has its own hashtag on Twitter #angryowl. One user called Blocked by Chick tweeted: 'We don't care how angry the owls get. We refuse to run like that. #Oregon #angryowl' The local paper, the Statesman Journal has also joined in on the fun with an online naming contest with 'Owlcapone' getting 238 votes and Owlpachino landing a respectable 177 votes. Wildlife experts suggest that the barred owl is not a local and comes from outside of the area. It's also thought that the owl, with a reported four foot wing span, has been staging the attacks to protect a nest. Keith Keever a representative from the Parks Operations Division said some members of the national Audubon society think that there could be more than one bird behind the sneak attack. He said: 'One person thought that there was a bird at one of the owl life refuges that maybe someone released, but to be released in the middle of Salem is not likely. 'It is suspected that it's a matting pair establishing in a new area.' Official said the 'angry owl' warning signs will include special vandal-proof fasteners to keep people from stealing the signs. All of the signs will also have a sticker on the back that thanks the Maddow Show and gives credit to its producers. Barred Owls are known to become aggressive during mating season or when they are defending a nest.","The quirky signs initially debuted on the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC .

"Twin Siamese girls who are joined at the chest and share the same heart 'will have to remain together', doctors have said. The conjoined twins, Anais and Amanda Cruz, from Chile, were born five months ago, and it was unclear whether an operation could be carried out to separate them. Now, surgeon Dr Humberto Caballero, who is caring for the girls, said: 'The twins were sent to have tests done now that they are five-months-old. 'The conclusion is that the girls hearts are joined, and as a result the babies will have to remain together.' Anais and Amanda Cruz, now five months old, were born joined at the chest and share one heart . Tests have been carried out and doctors now say they will never be separated, as they were born with a heart defect which results in low levels of oxygen in their blood . Experts said the twins were born with a Cyanotic heart, a condition which results in low levels of oxygen in the blood, and usually leads to a shorter life span in children. Dr Caballero added: 'The heart condition means that it's impossible to separate them and it would also be out of the question to remove one so that the other might live and develop normally.' Amanda and Anais are having tests done at the Catholic University of Santiago, Chile, but will shortly return to Vallenar, in the Chilean province of Huasco, where they were born, and will remain there for the future. Their father Waldo Cruz, 41, said that as long as the twins were alive they would care for them and give them as much love as possible. He said: 'As long as they are here it is heaven's will, and we will care for them.' The twins, who are joined at the chest and face each other, are known as 'thoracopagus' twins. This is the most common type of cojoined twins: 40 per cent are in this group, according to the Seattle Children's Hospital Foundation. Mother Ana Robledo and father Waldo Cruz said as long as the twins were alive they would  give them as much love as possible. Mr Cruz said: 'As long as they are here it is heaven's will, and we will care for them' Dr Humbert Caballero, who is treating the girls, says it would be 'out of the question' to remove one so that the other might live and develop normally . In about 75 per cent of cases, such as Anais and Amanda's, thoracopagus twins share one heart. Twins joined at the chest may also share their liver, biliary tract (which carries bile from the liver to the small intestine) and upper digestive tract. They are normally delivered by Caesearean section as a vaginal birth is too difficult for the mother and babies. Only 35 per cent of cojoined twins survive for one day after birth, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. However, among those who survive more than a day after birth, some continue to live for days, weeks, months or years while conjoined. Some live into adulthood still physically connected to each other. In December 2014, MailOnline reported on the brith of Asa and Eli Hamby, who were born in Atlanta. They can never be separated as they share one heart and one circulatory system . In December 2014 MailOnline reported on the case of conjoined twin brothers who share the same body and also share the same heart, who were born in Atlanta, U.S.. Asa and Eli Hamby can never be separated as they have a condition known as dicephalic parapagus - an extremely unusual form of conjoinment, affecting only one-in-a-million births. They will have to remain together because they share one heart and one circulatory system. The rare and extremely risky pregnancy carried through to 37 weeks and Robin and Michael traveled from Alabama, U.S., to Atlanta's Northside Hospital for specialist care. Conjoined twins are two children physically connected to each other at some point in their bodies. The lowest odds of this happening are 200,000 to one for every live birth and around 70 percent of conjoined twins are female. Conjoined twins are always the same sex and the form of conjoined twinning refers directly to where they are joined. The most most frequent are horacopagus (heart, liver, intestine), omphalopagus (liver, biliary tree, intestine), pygopagus (spine, rectum, genitourinary tract), ischiopagus (pelvis, liver, intestine, genitourinary tract), and craniopagus (brain, meninges). (American Pediatric Surgical Association) Experts think that conjoined twins come from a single egg that fails to separate. Around 200 conjoined twins are born each year and around half die before their first birthday. Veena and Vani, ten, were born joined at the head, but their parents left them in their local hospital in Hyderabad, India because they could not pay their medical expenses. For eight years the girls have eaten, played and slept in one room at Niloufer Hospital and have been cared for by nursing staff. They cannot be separated. Their doctor, Dr Narendra Kumar, a paediatric surgeon, is trying to find an international surgeon who specialises in neurology to perform the operation. He said: 'It has always been possible to operate on the girls because they both have individual brains. 'The problem lies with the one main blood vessel they share so it does have its risks.' Laleh and Ladan Bijani caught the attention of the world when at the age of 29 they decided to have surgery to separate. The sister's skulls were joined above the ear but each of their brains was intact. They were never able to look into one another's face without the aid of a mirror. Their dream was to walk out of Raffles Hospital in Singapore and walk in opposite directions. Sadly they both died after their surgery. Born in Tehran in 1974, they developed different personalities and made separate groups of friends. Ladan was the stronger personality and was more talkative, while Laleh was quieter. So when Ladan said she was determined to become a lawyer, Laleh had no choice but to study law with her. Conjoined twins Shivanath and Shivram Sahu caused quite a stir when they were born in India, with some people in their village worshipping them as divine incarnations. And while one doctor has said that it would be possible to separate the 12-year-olds, who were born joined at the waist, the duo are determined to remain together. Shivram said: ‘We don't wish to get separated. We will stay like this even when we grow old. We want to live as we are.’ The pair, who were born in a tiny village near Raipur in central India, share two legs and four arms and work in tandem to get around. They have stunned doctors with their ability to wash, dress and feed themselves. A local doctor told the family they were both healthy but he could not separate them. They are believed to share the same stomach but have independent lungs, hearts and brains. With practice they have learned to do all their basic daily chores with minimal fuss, including showering, eating, getting dressed and combing each other's hair. They are able to walk down the stairs of their simple split-level home and even run on all six limbs to play cricket and other games with neighboring children.","Doctors say Anais and Amanda Cruz 'will have to remain together'

"At first sight, it could be the catwalk equivalent of the emperor's new clothes. And though the lithe models sashaying down the catwalk on the first day of New York Fashion Week were at least partially clad, Kanye West's debut collection for Adidas is not for the faint-hearted. From nude body stockings to see-through skin-coloured crop tops, the outfits were entirely unforgiving - and strictly for the body confident. But while public opinion is still out, the bizarre ensembles do at least have one famous fan in the shape of Kanye's wife, Kim Kardashian. Scroll down for video . Nearly nude: Models at the Kanye x Adidas show wore nude body-stockings with crop tops underneath whilst his Kim Kardashian also wore an outfit designed by her husband . Wearable? It is yet to be seen whether every day fashion fans will be quick to snap up the designs . Yeezy x Adidas Originals AW15 . Get army chic! Visit site . It should have been all about the models on the catwalk but naturally Kanye West ensured his wife (and muse) Kim Kardashian was the best dressed at his Adidas fashion show yesterday. We're not used to seeing Miss Kimmy K. in anything but form fitting designer duds, but we're really loving this loose look on her. That Yeezy camo oversized jacket is everything!

The 34-year-old reality TV star liked the look so much, she even posted an Instagram photo of herself in one of the sheer ensembles, adding the legend: 'My look for the Yeezy show!!!!!! Yeezy head to toe!!!!!' Critics similarly seemed to enjoy Kanye's latest fashion offerings with Vogue saying: 'Kanye West's New collection with Adidas lives up to the hype.' The very fact that he had the fashion bible's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, and top designer Alexander Wang sitting front row at the show was testimony to to Mr West's popularity. In a review posted on the fashion magazine's website they seem notably impressed at the fact that Kanye had managed to persuade Adidas to drop their traditional three stripe logo from his designs, a feat never achieved by their previous collaborators. They said: 'Hems were raw and frayed, tops billowy, bottoms either skintight to slide into newly unveiled suede stiletto boots or cinched and ready to be tucked into aforementioned Boosts. 'There were immaculate flak vests and officer sweaters that looked like they’ve actually taken shrapnel, and everything was said to be unisex. Concluding: 'On display, in rigid lines of expressionless youth, it was at the very least satisfyingly instigative for a line of sportswear.' Sportswear: Kanye said he wanted to design a range of 'solutions based' clothing . Different shapes and sizes: Kanye has been praised for using models of different shapes, sizes and races . Fashion royalty: Vogue editor Anna Wintour attended the show posing her with Kim and Kanye . However much like anything Kanye does the show didn't come without controversy. From guests complaining they had to wait an hour in the cold for the event to start, to his daughter North screaming the house down mid show. And of course Kanye, who is known for his impassioned and sometimes angry rants, couldn't resist making a dig at the fashion industry, even whilst he was trying to impress them. In an early review of the collection, Women's Wear Daily commented that Kanye seems to be, 'perpetually running defense, clearly still wounded by the criticism directed at his previous design endeavors.' Indeed it was reported that he played a track over the top of the show telling his audience: 'I want to create something better for you. 'We have been limited. It's bigger than who I am even in my present living. It's about what when I was on earth what did I do to help?' He went on to say: 'I'm here to crack the pavement and make new ground. 'There's a lack of creativity in every field…people are afraid to create. I want people to think awesome is possible.' But did he manage to crack that pavement? Well, yes and no. Kanye certainly hasn't faced the same level of criticism that he has for his previous forays into the fashion world. Praised: The show is the first time Kanye has received praise for his attempts at fashion design . Casual: As well as the body suits some models wore relaxed sweatshirts and jumpers . Family affair: Kim's younger sister Kylie Jenner was featured in the show rocking a parred back look . Refinery 29  noted that Kanye's collection probably would sell well saying: 'It was a lineup of oversized jackets, sweatshirts, sweaters, and leggings, interspersed with Vanessa Beecroft-esque nude-colored underwear. 'A camo parka that Kim Kardashian also wore was a highlight, and we thought the oversized backpack was a clever accessory that'll probably make it into a healthy stack of editorials.' He has also been praised for using a variety of models, notably men and women of different races, shapes and sizes. 'Short, tall, sample size, not sample-size...while the diversity in the show wasn't quite a true-to-life cross-section of America (or even the subway car during your morning commute), it was a more interesting line-up of bodies than what we normally see during New York Fashion Week,' said Refinery. One notable face was his wife's younger sister Kylie Jenner, who appeared on the run way looking fresh-faced in comparison to her usual made up look. Perfect parker: The collection featured baggy coats which sat over the body-stockings . Walk that walk: Kylie Jenner looked as the models walked past in some of Kanye's more brightly coloured designs . Kanye claims that he wanted the collection to be made up of 'solutions based clothing,' saying, 'I don't want the clothes to be the life, I want the clothes to help the life.' It is also thought that it will have a relatively low price point compared to other designer clothes meaning the pieces can be snapped up by his fans. And the show certainly wasn't without support from a whole host of his famous friends. From Beyonce and Jay Z to P Diddy. Beyonce praised the collection  saying: 'I thought it was beautiful. Very innovative. I loved how the ladies lined up.' She was referring to the army like line-up of models which Kanye has revealed was inspired by the 2011 London Riots which were going on when he started designing the collection. It was this inspiration that Style.com believed helped the designs, they said: 'It was that suggestion of conflict that gave some spine to this collaboration with Adidas: a protective toughness, a body-conscious severity that made the clothes more than a simple accessory to the footwear that was the predictable focus of the whole event.' The footwear they reference is the Yeezy Boosts - which Kanye himself wore for the presentation. Camo: This model wore a camo jacket and the Yeezy Boost trainers which Kanye himself wore for the show . Kanye's army: The model's stood in an army-like formation wearing their outfits designed by the rapper . Kanye wasn't alone in creating his show taking advice and inspiration from artist Vanessa Beecroft on staging. He told ID of working with her: 'Me and Vanessa and her husband Federico just kept bouncing ideas. 'She really pushed and drove it to be something that was her absolute communication against the idea of bags that you could buy at the adidas store.' ID further praised Kanye for his latest attempt at fashion. They said: 'He's certainly trying. Kanye's earnest commitment to fashion saw its fullest expression to date in this show, which blended artistic elements in an interesting way.' For lest we not forget Mr West's previous fashion work has never earnt him the acclaim he so desperately seems to desire. When he released a womens-wear collection in Paris it was widely slated.The Daily Telegraph said Kanye should, 'Stick to the day job.' The Wall Street Journal bemoaned Kanye's designs, criticising the models over-sized shoes and likening his attempts at design to when Lindsay Lohan did a line for Ungaro - which was a resounding flop. Then when in 2013 he released a capsule collection with APC the Guardian questioned, 'Kanye West's APC collection: The new boring?' So to win praise is certainly a step forward for Kanye although it remains to be seen whether his clothes will be as popular with the public as they are with the editors.

"In recent months passengers have opened emergency exits moments before take-off, had fist fights over crying babies and even the heir to Korean Air has been jailed for throwing a tantrum after her nuts were served in the wrong way. But apparently it has been the best year ever for passengers behaving themselves on planes. According to new figures released from the Federal Aviation Administration, passengers have finally been cowed into submission - in the US at least. Scroll down for video . Sitting comfortably? Probably not, but it appears that passengers have been cowed into submission as the number of 'unruly passengers incidents' were the lowest since records began in 2014 . In its latest report, the number of 'unruly passenger incidents' in 2014 was the lowest since 1995 when the agency began collating the information. The FFA figures show that flight crews reported 121 unruly passenger to the authorities last year, significantly less that in previous years. Unacceptable behaviour includes passengers assaulting, threatening or intimidating airline crew, with reporting incidents at the discretion of crew members. Harsh penalties - up to $25,000, or £16,000 - and even criminal charges can be doled out to the worst offenders, although according to an investigation by USA Today, only 1 in 6 complaints has resulted in a fine between 2009 and 2013. The findings may come as a surprise to some frequent travellers, however. There was concern last year that air rage was actually on the rise as tightly-packed airplanes had led some passengers to take matters into their own hands. Passengers conditions may not be improving, but the number of passenger incidents was down in 2014 . While most of us can only dream of turning left as you enter an aircraft, cramped conditions and food you wouldn't even serve your dog has become standard fare for the rest of us back in zoo class . Incidents involving the so-called 'Knee Defender' - a device that clips onto the seat in front of you to prevent the chair from reclining - hit the headlines last August after a United Airlines flight was diverted due to a passenger scuffle involving the device. Reasons for the overall decline in passenger incidents may not be entirely clear cut however. The spike in reported passenger incidents in 2001 followed a 'zero tolerance' approach to bad behaviour, and the recent decline may be down to airlines denying boarding to unruly travelers and nipping potential problem passengers in the bud.","New figures from the FFA shows number of 'unruly passenger incidents' in 2014 was lowest since records began in 1995 .

"The strong pound compared to the euro means now is the time for Britons to bag a bargain break as prices at popular resorts such as Portugal's Algarve plummet. Costs at European resorts even compare favourably to six years ago when the sterling and euro reached parity, while sales in euros are also skyrocketing as the currency drops to a decade low. A basket of typical holiday items in the Algarve is now 50 per cent cheaper than it was in January 2009, reveals new research by Post Office Travel Money. A collection of typical holiday items in the Algarve is now 50 per cent cheaper than it was in January 2009 . New research by Post Office Travel Money confirms now is a great time to bag a bargain at eurozone resorts . But it's not all good news for our hip pockets abroad - prices in holiday hotspots such as Thailand have risen significantly in destinations such as Thailand and Dubai. The study looked at costs across  20 popular resort destinations for items such as a three-course dinner for two plus wine, sun cream and cigarettes with the package setting travellers back £32.67 in the Algarve - in January 2009 the same items were  £65. Coming in the next lowest in price was Sunny Beach in Bulgaria, where the same set of what some would consider essentials were £32.69, which is a 39 per cent less than the 2009 price. Spain's Costa del Sol (£33.64), Bali (£35.30) and Crete (£37) were also sun escapes that offer good value for tourists once there. Prices further afield, in holiday hotspots such as Thailand, have risen significantly compared to Europe . Next lowest in price is Sunny Beach in Bulgaria where cost of everyday items are down 39 per cent on 2009 . However it's not all good news for the British tourist's hip pocket as costs skyrocket in destinations outside the eurozone, where a pound is worth €1.346, and not so close to home. Changing pounds into local currency in the USA, the Caribbean, Dubai and Thailand, Brits can  receive up to £39 less than more favourable exchanges. In the survey of everyday items, Dubai is the dearest with the same set of goods and services costing up to £135.35, 80 per cent up on 2009, mainly due to the high price of going out for dinner. In the survey, Dubai is the dearest with the same set of goods and services costing up to £135.35 . St James in Barbados (£99.76) is the next priciest in the survey but that is still a drop on 2009 by 34 per cent. 'There is no doubt that UK tourists can look forward to getting more travel cash for their pounds this year in Europe but people planning trips further afield could get caught out by falling rates for sterling in some countries,' Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said. 'The best way to avoid this is to consider a holiday swap to a resort where the pound still stretches further and check to see how prices for meals and drinks compare in a range of destinations.' Potential swaps include heading to Mexico instead of the Dominican Republic, Jamaica in place of Barbados, Egypt rather than Dubai or Indonesia's Bali instead of Thailand. Or nearby, head to Portugal for a 20 per cent cheaper holiday that you'd get in non-euro Turkey. The RAC Foundation added that UK drivers heading for the continent during the school half-term holiday would also benefit from plunging petrol prices in Europe. Diesel is as low as 80p a litre in Austria and 83p a litre in France and Spain. Petrol costs just 86p a litre in Austria and Spain, is 92p a litre in France and 96p a litre in Germany. RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: 'It's a case of happy holidays for the tens of thousands of Brits who will be driving on the continent this half-term. 'The low fuel prices seen in the UK are being eclipsed by those across Europe. Motorists might be tempted to fill up before they cross the Channel but thanks to the strong pound they might be better off waiting until they get off the boat in places like Calais.'","European resorts even cheaper than when the pound plummeted in 2009 .

"Christian Grey is famous for his penchant for kinky sex accessorised with whips, crops and floggers in his Red Room of Pain. But actor Jamie Dornan, who plays the character made famous by author E L James in the much-anticipated film version of Fifty Shades of Grey, has admitted it's all new to him. An S&M expert had to be called onto the set to teach the Northern Irish actor, 32, who is married with a 15-month-old baby. Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were interviewed by Alison Hammond on today's This Morning ahead of the release of the Fifty Shades Of Grey film in which they star . Jamie as Christian Grey is seen whipping Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele in this still from the Fifty Shades of Grey film. The actor said he had to learn the technique from a 'kink adviser' 'We had a guy called Liam who was our kink adviser,' he revealed to Alison Hammond on today's episode of This Morning. The actor said he felt responsible for ensuring the bondage scenes with co-star Dakota Johnson were as authentic as possible, as it's these elements that have made the erotic novels a hit with people around the world. 'I probably learnt more than Dakota,' he explained. 'Anastasia is meant to be new to it all and clueless so the onus was on me to be doing things right.' Jamie previously told British Elle that Liam was keen for him witness first hand the kind of sex that is portrayed in the film so he invited him to see the sex dungeon in his house. The pair revealed on the ITV show what it was like to film the racy adaption of the bestselling erotic novel . Jame said sex is a big part of the film but there's also a love story between the two characters . Jamie, pictured with his co-star in another still from the film, visited a sex dungeon to learn more about how to play bondage billiionare Christian Grey who was created by author EL James . The actor recalled: 'I went there, he offered me a beer, and they did… whatever they were into. I saw a dominant with two submissives and he became our kink adviser on the film.' Speaking on the ITV programme, he said that sex is inevitably a big part of the movie - which opens in the UK this evening - but warned viewers will be disappointed if that's all they're expecting. 'It's hard to get away from it as it's a big part of the story so there's enough in there to keep you keen,' he explained. 'There has to be a good story too, you need something to carry the story through and that's the love story and the two characters that resonate with people.' Meanwhile, Dakota, 25, told Alison that she suffered for her art as in one of the sex scenes, Jamie threw her so hard onto the bed that she suffered whiplash. 'At the time she said I threw her like a piece of meat,' admitted Jamie, quipping: 'I'm just a very committed actor!' The pair have been busy promoting the film and attending premieres in London, Berlin and New York over the past week. Fifty Shades of Grey, which was directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, is expected to be a box office success but many of the reviews haven't been favourable so far. Much of the criticism was directed at Jamie, with Daily Mail film critic Brian Viner saying he is not convincing as the bondage billionaire. He said: 'As Christian, does the Northern Irishman, Dornan, pull it off? He pulls plenty off, as it happens, but not, alas, the part itself. Dakota revealed she suffered from whiplash after Jamie threw her 'like a piece of meat' onto the bed in one of the scenes from the highly anticipated film . The pair, pictured at the London premiere, have been working hard to promote the film adaptation of the first book in the trilogy but not all the reveiews have been favourable so far . 'For a 27-year-old billionaire with a hinterland supposedly about the size of Yellowstone National Park, Christian is strangely uncharismatic. 'Grey by name, grey by personality. And for a dedicated sadist he has an odd way with a whip, as if gently swatting a bluebottle that has errantly settled on Ana's bottom.' The Mail's columnist Jan Moir said in her review: 'Yes, this Fifty Shades Of Grim might have its titillating moments, but it just goes on and on and on for no good reason before ending in an abrupt and unsatisfactory way — the very definition of bad sex, not good.'","Actor revealed on This Morning he had to learn about bondage for part .

"Phuket, Melbourne, Bicester... Do you really know how to pronounce these places? It seems there are some place names that even the most well-travelled of us fail to say correctly, some exotic, some closer to home. Who knew that the correct way to say Dubai was 'Du-bay'? Or that the best way to say Bangkok is 'Bahg-gawk'? John Wells, Professor of Phonetics at University College London and author of Sounds Interesting Observations on English and General Phonetics, told Mail Online Travel: 'The problems derive mainly from the opaqueness of English spelling, which does not enable us to predict pronunciation with any certainty, and also from people's disinclination to study foreign languages.' Here are the place names we're most guilty of pronouncing wrong... Scroll down for video . Consider yourself well travelled and worldly-wise? How would you pronounce these place names? PHUKET, THAILAND . Not one you want to get wrong. The 'ph' is actually pronounced 'p' rather than 'f', while the hard 'k' is more like a 'g' sound. For an English tongue 'pu-get' is about as close as you will get to the proper pronunciation. BANGKOK . Thailand's capital city is a popular haunt for Britons abroad, but how many are pronouncing it correctly? The 'a' is more of an 'ah' sound, while the 'k' is harder, again, like a 'g' and the 'o' should be said 'aw', making the correct pronunciation more like ""Bahng-gawk"". The stunning Thai island of Phuket is a favourite with holidaymakers, but do we pronounce it correctly? MELBOURNE . Australia may be one of our favourite long-haul destinations, but it seems we can't pronounce one of their most famous cities. Melbourne, often pronounced 'Mel-born' is called 'melb'n' by the folks who live there. And while we're at it, let's get Brisbane right too, it is pronounced 'brisb'n'. BICESTER . Fancy a bargain? Head to Bicester Village, an oasis of budget shopping in one of Oxfordshire's fastest growing towns. That's 'Biss-ter' to you and me. OAXACA, MEXICO . Don't be fooled by the X, the way to say this beautiful Mexican state, is 'Wah-ha-ca'. Yes, just like the Thomasina Miers Mexican restaurant chain. She clearly couldn't trust us to pronounce the name correctly without a phonetic spelling to help us out. If you want to enjoy the delights of Australia's cultural hub Melbourne, make sure you also pronounce it the way the locals do . The former British colony of Dominica in the West Indies is pronounced 'dommi-neeka' WORCESTERSHIRE . The West Midlands county of Worcestershire has plenty to offer visitors, from beautiful Ragley Hall to the National Trust's Brockhampton Estate, a late 14th-century moated manor house. But first you'll need to be able to tell people where you are going. It may be tempting to pronounce all English counties ending in 'shire' as if you are a Hobbit, but it is actually a softer 'sheer' pronunciation you need. Now for Worcester. Forget the 'r' and the 'c' and instead blend the word to say 'wuster'. And so you have the county 'wustersheer'. A recent survey revealed that 82 per cent of us regularly trip over our words. And place names can be particularly confusing, according to the study commissioned by London railway station St Pancras International, which is itself frequently mispronounced by 33 per cent of people to sound like the gland 'pancreas'. It found the Cambridgeshire city of 'Ely' is the most commonly mispronounced word, with more than half of Brits (59 per cent) getting it wrong (it's pronounced 'ee-lee' not 'ee-lie'. And one in six (16 per cent) speakers do not pronounce the south-east London district of 'Greenwich' correctly. It should be pronounced 'gren-ich', not as it is seen. KINGUSSIE . A small but lively Highland town right in Cairngorms National Park in Scotland, it sits beside the river Spey and is surrounded by spectacular scenery. But just make sure that if you're heading that way, you say 'king-yoossie', not 'kin-gussie'. BLOEMFONTEIN . The capital of Free State Province in South Africa and famed as the 'city of roses', Bloemfontein is often a stop-off for travellers crossing the country thanks to its handy central location. But if you're heading that way, ask for directions to 'bloom-fontayn', not 'blohm-fon-tyne'. Are you getting Colombia, home to the beautiful city of Cartagena, confused with US university Columbia? DOMINICA . Dominica, the former British Colony in the West Indies, is famed as an untouched corner of the Caribbean with beautiful scenery and amazing walks. And it's pronounced 'dommi-neeka', not 'do-MINNika'. COLOMBIA . Not to be confused with top New York University, Columbia, the South American country is actually pronounced 'Col-ombia' rather than 'Columbia'. Beautifu Budapest is famous for its Ottoman heritage and for straddling the Danube... and it is pronounced 'buda-pesht' BUDAPEST . It is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, split down the middle as it straddles the Danube but connected through a series of elegant bridges. But If you've been pronouncing it phonetically as you read the word, you've been doing it wrong - The Hungarian capital is actually pronounced 'Booda-Pesht'. HOLBORN . If you are in London and heading to the British Museum, you'll be viisting the London borough of Holborn. It's well worth it. But if you're asking for directions on the Tube, forget the 'l' - this area of the capital, also famous for De Lane Lea recording studios and Holborn Bars, is actually pronounced 'Ho-burn'.","Did you know  that the correct way to say Dubai was 'Du-bay'?

"Once, they had to fix their bayonets and face a hail of bullets. Now, the latest recruits to the Army have a somewhat less perilous challenge...sitting behind a computer and logging on to Twitter and Facebook. The new brigade is inspired by the spirit of the Chindits - the Second World War special forces unit which served in Burma and became renowned for its unconventional methods. Digital warfare: The latest Army recruits will use social media including Facebook and Twitter in fight against radicalised young people . Rather than sending hundreds of troops around the world, the newest force is aimed at the social media war being waged by Islamic State and other terror organisations and their fight to radicalise young people. The brigade is designed to ‘meet the challenges of modern conflict and warfare’ by winning the hearts and minds of those in battle by both monitoring and engaging with digital and social media channels. Others will try to gather as much intelligence about what the enemy are doing, including their up to date movements, which may mean they are deployed in the field. Some will be responsible for putting out false information in a variety of ways to create diversions and throw the enemy off track. Elite: The new brigade will be name the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade – the elite British guerrilla unit known as the Chindits who fought in Burma in the 1940s. They were led by General Orde Wingate (pictured centre, wearing a pith helmet) This includes a ‘psychological’ element – undermining the enemy’s morale by covertly leaking messages to them and disseminating details of British successes. It comes after Islamic State jihadists gathered support from young Muslims around the world by posting propaganda on social media sites such as Twitter. A defence source said: ‘We are being challenged in this complex world. It is warfare short of what we would describe as war. We are thinking about fighting in a cleverer, smarter way. ‘It is a different way of thinking and it is a different way of fighting.’ The Ministry of Defence will establish Brigade 77 in April this year. It takes its name from the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade – the elite British guerrilla unit known as the Chindits who fought in Burma in the 1940s. Its badge will be a Burmese Lion – the mythical creature that guards Burmese temples - known as 'Chinthe', which was the word used to form the Chindits. It is similar to the one used by the Chindits, who were known for penetrating the Japanese lines during the Second World War. The Chindits were formed and led by Major General Orde Wingate during the Burma Campaign and their original brigades were irregular, special forces-style guerrilla units. They were trained as long-range penetration units and did not operate in regular battalion formations. They also did not enjoy the regular supply chains that support normal army operations. It may look more Star Wars than standard British Army issue. But this revolutionary piece of kit will soon be giving our troops unprecedented protection on the battlefield. The state-of-the-art Viper helmet replaces the ‘pudding bowl’ used by the Army since the 1980s. A special face bar fitted to the sides gives greater protection to the soldier’s head and the engineered plastic helmet also has a detachable jaw protector, ear protectors and a built-in radio. It is fitted with a video camera, capable of sending images back to commanders from the frontline, and powerful torches on either side. At under 3lb, it is lighter than the current helmet, which weighs 3.3lb. Futuristic: Troops will wear the new hi-tech helmet from September, which will give them greater security on the battlefield . Four years in development, the Viper helmet is made by Canada-based Revision and is part of a £30million contract with Israeli firm Source Vagabond, which will supply 9,000 to the Army and the Royal Marines over the next three years. A helmet offering greater protection to the head and neck was made a priority following the high level of injuries sustained in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Viper will be introduced from September and will be worn eventually by all troops. Based in Hermitage, Berkshire, the new brigade will comprise as many as 2,000 troops – including elite special forces soldiers. Around half will be reservists. The unit will support other regiments in operations around the world, including Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Some of the members will be specialists responsible for the delivery of ‘psychological operations’, ‘security and stabilisation’ and ‘media operations’. As well as using Facebook and Twitter, personnel will learn how to use sites such as Instagram effectively so they can engage with a younger population. General Sir Nicholas Carter, the Chief of the General Staff, said: ‘The brigade consists of more than just traditional capabilities. A source said: ‘One of the great lessons we have learnt from Afghanistan and Iraq is the extent to which you can change the fact on the ground by thinking through the orchestration of a range of different effects. (Brigade 77) is a recognition that warfare is changing – the character of war is changing. We have seen this in terms of behaviour on the ground by the Taliban and insurgents in Iraq. ‘It is fair to say in the information age in which we will fight and operate in the future, the number of audiences is much greater than it ever was.’ A defence source said: ‘The force that fought in such difficult conditions adapted to a new type of warfare, using a mixture of original, creative thinkers who integrated with local indigenous forces to multiply effects; the exact requirement for the modern age.’ Announcing the formation of Brigade 77, General Sir Nicholas Carter, the Chief of the General Staff, said: ‘The brigade consists of more than just traditional capabilities. It is an organisation that sits at the heart of trying to operate “smarter”. ‘It comprises a blend of regular troops from all three services as well as reserves and civilians. In fact the Brigade is 42 per cent reservist, drawing upon talent specialists from across the nation. ‘It will be seeking to draw the very best talent from the regulars and reserve as well as finding new ways of allowing civilians with bespoke skills to serve alongside their military counterparts.’","New brigade aims to beat terror organisations with digital warfare .

"The Abbott Government asked the Australian Human Rights Commission president to resign just two weeks before she oversaw the release of a damning report on children in immigration detention. A government official acting on behalf of Attorney-General George Brandis made the verbal request that Gillian Triggs step down, assuring that ‘some other opportunity’ would be made available to her, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Professor Triggs rejected the request, which did not come with any reasons why she should step down. As part of the five-year contract she signed in July 2012 she can only be sacked for bankruptcy or serious misconduct. Scroll down for video . Commission President Gillian Triggs was reportedly asked to resign from her position before the damning human rights report was published . The news come after Mr Abbott admitted he doesn't feel any guilt about the treatment of children in detention centres as heartbreaking drawings were released showing the effect it has on their mental stability. The drawings by young children held inside Australia's detention centres were released as part of the damning report from Ms Trigg and the Australian Human Rights Commission that found hundreds of children threatened to or committed self harm in immigration detention. When the Prime Minister was asked on radio on Thursday about the report and whether he felt 'any guilt' over the treatment of children in detention, he replied: 'None whatsoever'. 'The most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats. We have stopped the boats,' Mr Abbott told 3AW's Neil Mitchell. Drawings of crying faces by young children held inside Australia's detention centres were released as part of a damning report from the Australian Human Rights Commission . Tony Abbott has admitted he doesn't feel any guilt about the treatment of children in detention centres as heartbreaking drawings were released showing the effect it has on their mental stability . The report, titled The Forgotten Children, was tabled in parliament on Wednesday night. Drawings by children in detention accompanied the report and depicted crying faces, rows of tents and children watching from behind bars as Australians enjoy the freedom outside a detention centre. The long-awaited report called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm. Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014. Mr Abbott's remarks on radio on Thursday came after he was told there were 10-year-olds on suicide watch and three-year-olds with depression. 'There were almost 2,000 children in detention in the middle of 2013 under the former government’s watch, there were almost 1,400 children in detention at the time of the election. That number is now under 200. Why? Because this government has stopped the boats,' Mr Abbott responded. 'Now I have a very simple question: Where was the Human Rights Commission during the life of the former government when hundreds of people were drowning at sea? 'This is a blatantly partisan politicised exercise and the Human Rights Commission ought to be ashamed of itself.' Ms Trigg can only be sacked for bankruptcy or serious misconduct . Drawings by children in detention accompanied the report and depicted crying faces, rows of tents and children watching from behind bars as Australians enjoy the freedom outside a detention centre . This picture of a boy crying as he waits was drawn by a primary school aged child at Christmas Island in 2014 . The long-awaited report called for a royal commission into the treatment of children in immigration detention after concluding that prolonged detainment caused significant mental and physical harm . The report made 16 recommendations after the most comprehensive 10-month inquiry in a decade into the policy of detaining  children who arrive in Australia by boat to seek asylum. The commission found that Australia's practice of holding children in detention violated human rights law and recommended that they should be released as soon as possible into the community. Neil Mitchell: Do you feel any guilt at all about the way children have been dealt with in detention? Tony Abbott: None whatsoever, Neil. Neil Mitchell: But there are 10-year-olds on suicide watch? Tony Abbott: Neil, the most compassionate thing you can do is stop the boats. We have stopped the boats… . Neil Mitchell: Three-year-olds with depression? Tony Abbott: Neill, there were almost 2,000 children in detention in the middle of 2013 under the former government’s watch, there were almost 1,400 children in detention at the time of the election. That number is now under 200. Neil Mitchell: Do you want those 200 kids out of detention? Tony Abbott: Of course, of course, but the best way to ensure, the only way to ensure that we have no children in immigration detention is not to have any boats. It called on the federal government to ban indefinite detention, close the 'harsh and cramped' Christmas Island immigration centre, get children off Nauru and appoint an independent guardian for unaccompanied minors. The report stated that 'there appears to be no rational explanation for the prolonged detention of children.' Commission President Gillian Triggs said that the Australian government's amendments to the Migration Act, which redefined the term 'refugee', was of 'profound concern'. 'It is imperative that Australian governments never again use the lives of children to achieve political or strategic advantage,' she said. 'The aims of stopping people smugglers and deaths at sea do not justify the cruel and illegal means adopted,' she told SBS. 'Australia is better than this.' However, Attorney-General George Brandis told parliament that the recommendations had been a long-standing point of difference between the government and the commission. 'The government does not accept the commission's findings,' he said. Mr Brandis said that the federal government had made 'significant progress' towards changing the conditions of detention centres since the commission's inquiry had started. 'In short, children in detention is a problem created exclusively by the former Labor Government, which has largely been solved by the current Abbott Government,' he told SBS. Hundreds of assaults against children were reported and 128 teenagers harmed themselves between January 2013 and March 2014 . This drawing by a 16-year-old boy on Christmas Island last year depicts someone asking for 'help!' This picture drawn by a six-year-old detained at the Christmas Island Detention Centre with the words 'I want go out' GetUp Campaigns Chief Erin McCallum said that the findings of the report were concerning. 'Whatever your political persuasion, locking up innocent kids in hideous detention camps is barbaric and it has to stop,' she said. Greens immigration spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said the report must be the turning point to end the cruel practice of locking children in detention camps. 'This vile, institutionalised child abuse has to end,' she said in a statement. 'No longer can we turn a blind eye to the sexual, physical and psychological abuse that these policies of indefinite detention are inflicting on children.' Immigration Minister Peter Dutton - who only took on the job in late December - said many of the recommendations reflected existing government policies and were superfluous. It called on the federal government to ban indefinite detention and close the 'harsh and cramped' Christmas Island immigration centre (pictured) The report stated that 'there appears to be no rational explanation for the prolonged detention of children' 'Other recommendations would mean undermining the very policies that mean children don't get on boats in the first place,' he said in a statement. Numbers of children in immigration detention peaked at nearly 2000 in mid-2013 under Labor but now there are only 162 children still detained. Activist group ChilOut said children must only be detained as a measure of last resort and only for the shortest appropriate period. 'This report highlights our dramatic failure to uphold our obligations, by detaining children arbitrarily as punishment for seeking asylum,' it said in a statement.

"It was a foul-mouthed rant from former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd that no one was meant to see. But his f-bomb laden tirade went viral in 2012 when someone stole footage of him losing it as he bungled lines for a recorded video message and uploaded it online. Now three years on, it has been revealed Australian Federal Police spent 476 hours trying to narrow down suspects but they are still no closer to finding the culprit, ninemsn reports.

Police did not pursue this further as US authorities ruled they didn't have probable cause to make Google reveal its records. If the police had managed to locate the person responsible, they may have faced up to 10 years in jail as it was considered theft from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.","Kevin Rudd's foul-mouthed rant went viral after it was uploaded in 2012 .

"A fugitive child molester has been arrested after 28 years on the run, posing as a dead man from Rhode Island. Stanley Shane Self, who went on the run in 1986, was busted trying to used a false identity to claim Social Security benefits. Self was convicted by a court in Arizona of three counts of child molestation - but went on the run and had been missing ever since. Cornered: Stanley Shane Self, 74, was arrested in Alabama 28 years after being convicted by an Alabama jury of three counts of child molestation . He had been living in Hollywood, Alabama for years, using the identity of a man from Rhode Island who died in 1987, according to federal investigators. According to local news station WFSB, people in the town where he'd been laying low knew him as Terry Martell. According to neighbors, Self had always seemed 'nice' - and would even to go church with them. Officials said Self presented a Rhode Island birth certificate and an Oklahoma driver's license with the false name when he applied for benefits. When his credentials didn't check out, a Social Security worker flagged the case as suspicious - and an investigating led to the pedophile being unveiled. A federal magistrate judge in Alabama had dismissed the false statement charges against Self so he can be returned to Arizona. Home: Self had been living under the name Terry Martell on this street on Hollywood, Alabama, for years . Self's attorney, James Gibson, declined to comment. He is currently being held in Morgan County Jail, Alabama - but Arizona authorities are set to extradite him soon. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance said: 'This man skirted justice for many years, but he did not escape it,. 'Thanks to an alert Social Security employee in Albertville and swift investigation by Social Security OIG and Secret Service agents, Self will soon face the punishment for his crimes committed more than 30 years ago in Arizona.'","Stanley Shane Self was convicted of child molestation in 1986, then fled .

"The U.S. Department of Agriculture has approved what promises to be be the first commercialized biotech apple, a fruit that resists browning after it's been cut open or bruised. The Obama administration's decision came as a surprise to many since the USDA rejected efforts by the organic industry and other critics of genetically modified plants – including environmental groups – to block the new fruit from the consumer marketplace. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health . Inspection Service approved the planting of two GMO varieties grown by the Canadian company Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc. on Friday. The company triumphantly distributed a 30-second time lapse video that shows its new product alongside an ordinary apple as 24 hours tick by. One half-apple turns brown. The other remains yellow and appetizing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Which would you rather eat? The Arctic Apple (below) doesn't brown after it's been cut open . The new fruit strain is identical to ordinary apples in every way but one: a single genetic manipulation that stops it from being 'oxidized' when it hits the open air . Okanagan plans to market the apples as Arctic Granny and . Arctic Golden, and says the apples are identical to their . conventional counterparts except the flesh of the fruit will . retain a fresh appearance even after it is sliced or bruised. 'All we've done is reduce the expression of a single enzyme, company president Neal Carter said in a statement. 'There are no novel proteins in Arctic fruit and their nutrition and composition is equivalent to their conventional counterparts. He called the USDA approval 'a . monumental occasion.' 'It is the biggest milestone yet for us, and we can't wait . until they're available for consumers,' he said in a statement. Carter said Arctic apples will first be available in late . 2016 in small quantities, and it will take many years before the . apples are widely distributed. He anticipates a 'slow but steady market introduction,' he said. 'Our focus is working with growers to get trees in the ground.' The new Okanagan apples have drawn opposition from environmentalists and organic-only food advocates. The . Organic Consumers Association, a lobby group funded by organic food and cosmetics companies, petitioned the USDA . to deny approval. That group claims genetic changes that prevent browning . could be harmful to human health, and also alleges that pesticide levels on the . apples could be excessive. OCA director Ronnie Cummins, a long-time purveyor of fright in food politics, said Friday that he plans to pressure food retailers and distributors not to sell the apples . 'This whole thing is just another big experiment on humans . for no good reason,' he said. The USDA said it had determined the apples were 'unlikely to . pose a plant pest risk to agriculture' and they are 'not likely . to have a significant impact on the human environment.' The law . only allows the agency's decision to be based on its analysis of . the plant pest risk to agriculture or other plants in the United . States. But there has been no scientifically documented and reproducible study that shows human health harms from GMOs. The USDA has approved the planting of the Artic Granny and Arctic Golden (shown) varieties of the fruit, grown from seeds containing genes that have been pinpoint-modified in a laboratory . New plantings have been approved and the fruit could hit grocery stores as early as the fall of 2016 . The Food and Drug Administration, which monitors new food technologies from a human health standpoint, has no mandatory . review process for genetically engineered foods. Okanagan is embracing a voluntary consultation with the agency, however. The Center for Food Safety is another group that has a problem with GMOs. Named in a way that often causes name-confusion with the government's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, the organization is funded by donations from large foundations that often bankroll environmental groups. In the case of GMOs, their millions have seen little impact. 'We think there are some possible risks that were not . adequately considered,' the center's Doug Gurian-Sherman told Bloomberg. But Okanagan said in a statement its apples have undergone . 'rigorous review,' and are 'likely the most tested apples on the . planet.' Apples have been the subject of intense food fears before. In 1989 a scandal erupted over Alar, a ripening agent made by the Uniroyal company that was sprayed on the fruit. 1989: '60 Minutes' demonized a ripening agent chemical sprayed on on apples called Alar; while a green group reaped a financial windfall, apple growers suffered from the overblown report . Growers were forced to stop using the chemical after a television expose that claimed it was harmful to children's health. 'The most potent cancer-causing agent in our food supply is a substance sprayed on apples to keep them on the trees longer and make them look better,' the late Ed Bradley intoned on 20/20. 'That's the conclusion of a number of scientific experts, and who is most at risk? Children who may someday develop cancer.' For weeks apples sat rotting on grocers' shelves and thousands of fruit growers took a financial hit Nearly $10 million in federal aid went to compensate some of them, and hundreds of school districts banned apples from cafeteria lunches. The Wall Street Journal later revealed that the name-and-shame scheme was a project of a Washington, D.C. public relations firm called Fenton Communications, which used it to benefit the Natural Resources Defense Council and other green groups. A 1-900 phone number on the screen during the CBS News broadcast helped the environmental charity raise money thruogh toll-call fees. The NRDC had already petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to ban Alar, but the EPA had rejected its scientific evidence three weeks before the broadcast aired.","Green groups and organic-only food advocates had pushed hard for the techno-fruit to be rejected .

"They are the notorious jihadist group who have viciously  slaughtered seven hostages on video and spread terror throughout the Middle East. But Isis - now a byword for extremist brutality - is also the name of an Egyptian goddess… and one very unlucky 13-year-old schoolgirl. Isis Boorman-Tuck is one of hundreds of people nationwide who share a name with the terrifying group who are gloried in videos showing the horrific beheading of hostages. And even though she suffers taunts as a result of the unfortunate link, she is determined not to change her name and is even considering passing it on to her children. Individual: Isis Boorman-Tuck (left) said she loves her name despite its association with the extremist group Islamic State . The Boorman-Tucks - dad Philip (left), mum Serena (second left), Isis (centre), and her siblings Zeon, 20, (second from right) and 11-year-old twins India (far right) and Symika (third from right) - embrace individuality . Across the world, people and businesses are regretting choosing the name Isis since the 2013 formation of the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). But this is not the case for the Boorman-Tucks - mum Serena, dad Philip, Isis and her siblings Zeon, 20, and 11-year-old twins India and Symika - from Hythe in Kent who embrace individuality. ‘To be honest, I love my name and I don’t really mind it’s the same as Islamic State because Isis was an Egyptian goddess and that came before,' the 13-year-old said. 'People have made jokes about it saying I’m a terrorist, but I just take it as a joke. ‘One of my friends posted on Facebook “Isis please don’t blow me away”. I don’t really mind.' Isis said the situation in Iraq and Syria - a topic she has covered in her travel and tourism classes - is 'terrible'. She admits she daydreams in lessons and regulary snaps back to reality when ISIS is mentioned. Mum Serena (left) stands by her decision to call her daughter Isis (right) and all her children have unusual names . ‘To be honest, I love my name and I don’t really mind it’s the same as Islamic State because Isis was an Egyptian goddess and that came before,' the 13-year-old said . Mum Serena stands by her decision to call her daughter Isis, and she gave her other siblings similarly unusual names. In Ancient Egypt, Isis was worshipped as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. 'We like Egypt and that's where we holiday,' she said. 'The name just sounded really nice. 'People normally just said ""it's really nice"" and ask what the meaning is. There is nothing horrible. 'Boys make jokes on Facebook like ""you blow me away"". 'To her, it's her name and they (ISIS) have nicked it. She gets quite excited because her name is on the TV. 'You could look into loads of different names and find someone bad who has got that name.' The Year 9 student at Brockhill Park Performing Arts College in Hythe, who said some people think she's made her name up, doesn't think parents of children called Isis have anything to worry about. ‘It’s just a name, it’s not like anyone is going to hurt them or anything,' she said. ‘They should feel proud and individual.’ Terrorists: Across the world, people and businesses are regretting choosing the name Isis since the 2013 formation of the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal there were 390 baby girls named Isis in England and Wales over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013. This includes 46 girls In 2013, despite the actions of the terrorist group reported almost daily. More than 40,000 people have signed the Thousands of Women and Girls Named Isis, Petition Media to Stop Calling the Terrorists by Our Name petition, started by U.S. woman Isis Martinez. 'You can help save the name of #ThousandsofWomenNamedIsis and save us from the backlash of being associated with this horrific terrorist group of monsters,' Ms Martinez wrote in a post on the online petition page. 'Little girls, especially in the United States, named Isis have reported bullying while women with the name are facing negative associations through their employment and in public places like airports, airplanes even at times being called terrorists themselves.' A statue of Isis found off the coast of Alexandria . The goddess Isis was first worshipped in Ancient Egypt as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic. She is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed god featured throughout Egyptian theology. Her image as a model of womanhood made her popular both with the slaves, who saw her as a mother-figure, and the wealthy, who saw her as a example to wives. It was believed that the annual flooding of the River Nile came from the tears of Isis as she wept over the death of her brother Osiris. The figure of Isis passed into Roman and Greek mythology and she is still worshipped by some pagans today. Some scholars have suggested images of Isis holding her son influenced images of Mary and Jesus in Christian religion. She was also incorporated into the symbolism of Freemasonry and is referred to in Mozart's opera, the Magic Flute. The goddess also gives her name to the section of the River Thames from its source until it reaches Dorchester-on-Thames.","Isis Boorman-Tuck, 13,  is considering passing her name on to her children .

"Judge John Hurley has come face-to-face with murderers, rapists and drug dealers during his time in bond court. But when plucky 80-year-old Dolores Sheinis walked in wearing a prison jumpsuit, he quickly realized it was going to one of his most entertaining hearings. Her appearance at Broward County Court, Florida, quickly turned comical with the inmates sat behind her, attorneys and the judge breaking into hysterics. Scroll down for video . Funny side of the law: Judge John Hurley starts laughing during 80-year-old Dolores Sheinis' appearance in Broward County Court, Florida. During the three-minute hearing she made the courtroom break into hystrerics . She was taken into custody last Friday after resisting arrest for violating a protection order put in place by her husband more than 30 years ago. During the three-minute hearing she called the judge 'sweetheart', said she couldn't recognize his twang and asked if he could take her out for breakfast. 'Have you ever thought of doing a stand-up routine,' Judge Hurley asked her, to which she replied: 'If you pay me good money sweetheart I'll be there. I'm really short of funds. Bizarrely she then said: 'I don't tip anybody. I make them banana bread and chocolate pudding pie.' Still laughing, Judge Hurley then said: 'You've brightened my day m'am', to which she replied 'That's what the last guy said.' Mrs Sheinis then said: 'That is what the last guy said.' Cracking up: The plucky elderly woman, facing charges for resisting arrest, called the judge a sweetheart, made fun of his twang and boasted about her cooking skills while in court . He then asked the defendant: 'How am I doing as a judge today.' She replied 'Not bad but you could do better.' After the hilarious back-and-forth, the judge told Sheinis to stay away from her husband. She told him: 'I haven't bothered him for 31 years, why would I bother him now? I swear to God and all that's holy on a stack of bibles, I will never go near him, talk to him, call him or even look at him.' The judge asked her: 'What is it you said before ""all that's holy""'. Sheinis said: 'I don't remember. I didn't recognize your twang.' Sheinis was the dismissed and as she left, the judge waved her goodbye.

"Katie Hopkins might have made enemies on Celebrity Big Brother but it seems the outspoken star is intent on making a few more after branding Atomic Kitten singer Natasha Hamilton 'chubby' during a TV appearance. Now the 32-year-old singer has hit back, describing Hopkins' words as 'harmful' and saying the reality star is likely to leave a 'toxic and negative' legacy. Hamilton was left fuming after 40-year-old Hopkins' appearance on The Wright Stuff - in particular because she gave birth to her fourth child just five months ago. Writing in a post on her BabyCentre blog, Hamilton explained that she has focused on looking after her health since the birth and reacted with 'complete horror' when she heard Hopkins' remark. Scroll down for video . New mother Natasha Hamilton, who is a size 8 and gave birth five moths ago, has hit back at outspoken Katie Hopkins after she called girlgroup Atomic Kitten, of which Natasha is a member, 'chubby' on national TV . The star, who found fame singing with Liz McClarnon and Kerry Katona in Atomic Kitten, also said that such remarks increase the pressure on women. 'It is pressure from women like Katie Hopkins - who talk utter nonsense and define people by their looks and weight - who are responsible for this pressure,' she fumed. Hamilton, who says her weight has been scrutinised since she was 20, continued by saying she's now old enough and confident enough  to brush Hopkins' 'idiotic comments' aside. 'If she feels it’s justified to call me “chubby”,' she continued, 'despite the fact I’m a new mum and a size 8, the woman is clearly very harmful and the less exposure she gets the better.' Motormouth Katie, left, was speaking on The Wright Stuff when she branded Natasha, pictured, right, with new daughter Lola Rose, and her band mates 'chubby' Unfortunately, added the Atomic Kitten star, not every woman is so confident. 'The sad reality is, there’ll be other women, especially new mums, who will feel under pressure by her comments.' Hamilton also used her post to discuss her struggle with post-natal depression, sparked by the birth of her first child Josh in 2002. 'My weight plummeted dramatically,' she remembers, 'and I found it increasingly difficult to leave the house and go to work. 'I knew there’d be another weight related story that would be criticise me further.' Natasha, pictured with her bandmates Liz McClarnon and Kerry Katona, says she's now old enough and confident enough in her own skin to brush Katie's 'idiotic comments' aside . Twelve years on and Hamilton says she has learned to love herself and is teaching her children to love others whatever their shape or size. 'I think Katie Hopkins’ fixation on berating people’s looks masks her own insecurities,' she concludes. 'What’s worse is that she is a mother. Does she really believe her own children will be impervious to cruel jibes and insults - what a shame that her legacy will be so toxic and negative.' The spat came shortly after Hamilton showed off her incredible post-baby body during a performance with her Atomic Kitten bandmates at G-A-Y in London on Saturday night. The 32-year-old singer donned a daring PVC cut-out jumpsuit for the performance, which revealed a leather bra and matching pants. The girls were taking to the stage exactly 14 years to the day after they played their first G-A-Y gig.

"Many reasons have been suggested to explain why  women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies. Now, a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics, by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office, women like to be part of a team. The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team’s. A new study claims that while men enjoy competition in the office (illustrated with a stock image), women like to be part of a team. The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues’ ability than women and were more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team . Researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team. They found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment, in comparison to 44 per cent of women. The experts believe the reason for this is that men are more likely to think their colleagues may let them down and that even high-performing women were attracted by team working. However, it is worth noting that the majority of both the sexes were keen to compete in the workplace on their own terms. ‘While women tend to shy away from competition, the results suggest that men shy away from cooperation,’ said study author Peter Kuhn, professor of economics at the University of California. A stock image of two women working together is shown . Women dislike having a female boss at work more than men do, a previous study revealed. Nearly 40 per cent of female workers in America would rather be led by a man, a Gallup survey found in October last year. In contrast, just over one quarter of men would prefer a male boss, with 58 per cent not caring either way. The study, which collected responses from 1,032 U.S. adults, found that only one-fifth of people would prefer to have a female boss if they were to take a new job. But it also revealed that workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman, compared to those with a male boss, at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. ‘While women tend to shy away from competition, the results suggest that men shy away from cooperation,’ said study author Peter Kuhn, professor of economics at the University of California. ‘In fact, while part of the decision is a matter of preferences, the difference is mainly explained by the fact that compared with men, women hold much less pessimistic beliefs about the relative performance of their potential team members.’ The study, published in the Economic Journal, also found that when there was a small economic advantage to working in a team, a similar number of men and women chose it. Previous research has found that men react more strongly to monetary incentives so a small financial incentive may boost men’s enthusiasm for working in teams especially. Co-author Professor Marie Claire Villeval, of CNRS-GATE, said: ‘Individuals who choose the team compensation scheme tend to perform less well on average than those who choose to be paid based on their own performance. ‘This results from the fact that the less able workers anticipate that by joining a team, they can improve their earnings thanks to the higher productivity of their colleagues. But this is less true for women than for men.’ The study, published in the Economic Journal, also found that when there was a small economic advantage to working in a team (illustrated with a stock image), a similar number of men and women chose it . Although the number of female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies  reached a historic high in 2014, only 4.8 per cent of this elite group are women. Last year, a Cancer Research UK study found that women are still lacking in self-confidence, not putting themselves forward for promotion, and perceive men to have advantages over them. A quarter of the women (26 per cent) interviewed said they felt that adopting stereotypical male characteristics could help them to get to the top of their field. Meanwhile, one in five women (20 per cent) believed gender discrimination at work had made it more difficult for them to reach their career goals. And over a third (38 per cent) said lack of confidence in their own abilities and a reluctance to push for promotions (37 per cent) was making it harder for them to reach progress up the ladder. Other potential barriers for women making the leap into management positions were found to include lack of flexible working arrangements to allow for childcare and the 'negative' attitudes of employers and colleagues with regard to balancing work and family life. Previous studies have argued that women are reluctant to enter jobs or sectors that thrive on competitive behaviour, while men, in contrast, are more attracted to competition - a view unpopular with some feminists. Professor Villeval said: ‘There is no doubt that reaching top positions in business or winning an election requires competitiveness. ‘But if women tend to avoid competitive environments, it seems important to have a better understanding of which types of working environments do attract women, and how women fare relative to men in those environments. ‘In particular, are women more attracted than men to cooperative working environments? The findings of this research suggest that the answer is yes.’ CEO and author Margaret Heffernan, who has written a book about competition in the workplace disagrees that women aren't as competative as men. She cites behavioural economist Uri Geneezy who found that in matriarchal societies, the women are the more competitive sex. 'In other words, coming from a culture in which they were accustomed to power and success, women were more than willing to enter the fray,' she wrote in The Huffington Post. 'The problem isn't, therefore, that women aren't competitive. The problem is that, in our society, they're smart and able enough to see that they're unlikely to win.' '...It's evident that while many well-performing female hurt themselves financially by shying away from competition, poorly performing males also hurt themselves by embracing it.'","Study was conducted by  CNRS-GATE and University of California experts .

"Justice for Audrie: the parents of 15-year-old Audrie Pott have started a petition to have the three teenagers who sexually assaulted and drove her to suicide expelled from school . The parents of Audrie Pott, the 15-year-old California girl who was driven to suicide after being sexually assaulted and bullied, have started a petition to have the three boys who attacked their daughter expelled from school. The trio of teenagers, whom the Daily Mail is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility. Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state. The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school. On Wednesday, the Pott family launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie’s 'slut-shaming.’ ‘It is important to note that the crimes committed against Audrie would have resulted in rape charges in many states, specifically Tennesse [sic] with the Vanderbilt case and Ohio with the Stubenville case,’ the petition reads. ‘But not in California. The criminal charges and identities of her assailants were protected by the juvenile justice system in place in California.’ The family’s plea states that Audrie's parents have persistently urged school officials to expel the teenage boys, but according to the family, 'no disciplinary actions have been taken against these students by their high schools.' Tormentors: The three teenagers (pictured with their faces obscured) pleaded guilty to sexual assault last year and were sentenced to 30-45 days in a juvenile detention facility . The petition goes on to say that the young men in question allegedly did not learn their lesson, as evidenced by the fact that at least two of them 'continued to ""slut shame"" other minor female girls by disseminating nude and semi-nude pictures of them.' According to the Pott family, allowing Audrie’s tormentors to continue attending class sets a bad example to other students, who may get the impression that such behavior will be tolerated. ‘Because of their actions, Audrie will not be able to graduate from high school, and her assailants should not have the honor of walking across that stage either,’ the online appeal concludes. The petition was addressed to Christopher High School Principal Paul Winslow and Saratoga High School Principal Paul Robinson. As of early Friday morning, nearly 18,500 people have signed the family’s school expulsion petition. At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body. Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers. 'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident. The petition was addressed to the principal of Saratoga High School . The principal of Christopher High School was also named in the plea posted on Change.org . She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house. In addition to the criminal charges, the Potts have filed a civil lawsuit against the teens they say are responsible for their daughter's suicide. Shockingly, one of the boys convicted of assaulting Pott is claiming that the girl's parents share some of the blame in their daughter's tragic death. In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. Heartbroken: Larry Pott and Audrie's stepmother Lisa believe that the bullying at school led to the tragedy . She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.' When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person. 'She had been, literally, the best person you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.'","Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself September 12, 2012 - eight days after she was sexually assaulted at a party and then shamed .

"Actress Victoria Rowell is suing CBS and Sony, claiming that they refused to re-hire her on soap opera The Young And The Restless because she publicly reprimanded them over a lack of racial diversity on the show. Rowell, 55, joined the cast of the show as Drucilla Barber Winters in 1990. But she claims that experiences of racial discrimination on set led to her 'reluctantly' leaving in 2007 after starring in 2,000 episodes. In 2010, Rowell, from Maine, approached the show – made by Sony and broadcast by CBS – in the hope that her role could be reprised, or that her character could appear on sister production The Bold And The Beautiful. Scroll down for video . Actress Victoria Rowell is suing CBS and Sony, claiming that they refused to re-hire her on soap opera The Young And The Restless because she publicly reprimanded them over a lack of racial diversity on the show . However, she claims that she was denied re-employment and blackballed ‘because of her public appeals to hire more African Americans in front of and behind the camera’, according to a statement. It said: 'She knew she was being impoverished and blackballed because she had chosen to speak out against discrimination and injustice that she had endured and witnessed happen to other African Americans.' Last year, for example, she wrote on Twitter: ‘Young & Restless on air for 40 years, loyally watched by their absolute competitive-edge audience (blacks) & not one black Exec Producer?’ Her attorney Cyrus Mehri said: ‘All Ms Rowell is seeking is basic fairness. We are confident that Ms Rowell will be rehired if the issue is considered in a serious and non-retaliatory manner. Rowell (left) was on the show from 1990 to 2007, appearing in 2,000 episodes . 'Ms Rowell made Drucilla Winters one of the most compelling characters ever to appear on daytime television. In refusing to re-employ her, the defendants aren’t just hurting Ms Rowell, they’re acting against their own economic self-interest.’ Ms Rowell said: ‘The Young And The Restless holds such a special place for the millions of viewers who tune in to watch these characters every day. It’s unfortunate that the cast and crew do not reflect this diverse audience. 'The character Drucilla was popular because she represented a positive role model for African Americans and audiences need to have that represented in their favorite shows.’ Rowell claims in the suit that ‘racial discrimination is blatant at The Young And The Restless’, pointing out that as of 2010, over 100 writers had been used, but not one was African American. The suit claims that the defendants’ retaliation 'has caused substantial financial and monetary harm to Ms Rowell', forcing her to ‘tap into employee benefits’ - and caused 'mental anguish'. When MailOnline asked Ms Rowell whether she was confident of winning the case, she explained that throwing the spotlight on the perceived issue was victory in itself. She said: 'As for winning, I have won, exposing this unacceptable racist and retaliatory behavior in 21st century America.' CBS, quoted by People.com, said: ‘We were disappointed to learn that, after leaving the cast of The Young and the Restless on her own initiative, Ms Rowell has attempted to rewrite that history through lawyers' letters and a lawsuit that has no merit. We harbor no ill will toward Ms. Rowell, but we will vigorously defend this case.’ Rowell received 11 NAACP Image Awards and two Daytime EMMY nominations for her role as Drucilla.","Victoria Rowell starred in 2,000 episodes of The Young And The Restless .

"A seven-year-old leukemia survivor from California gave an impassioned speech urging his school district to endorse upcoming legislation in support of vaccination. Rhett Krawitt may not have been big enough to reach the microphone without a chair, but he made his voice heard as he spoke of the illness he conquered. 'For three-and-a-half years I took chemo to get the bad guys out,' the child said. 'Now I can say gone with cancer.' On Thursday he urged elected officials at his Martin County school to support an upcoming bill that would prevent parents from opting out of required vaccines for their children because of personal beliefs. Rhett Krawitt, 7,  gave an impassioned speech urging his school district to endorse upcoming legislation that would prevent parents from opting out of required vaccines for their children because of personal beliefs . Rhett, with his parents, is a leukemia survivor and has been in remission for a year. His body is not yet strong enough to be immunized for measles and he must rely on protection from other vaccinated children . Rhett finished his short speech by twisting a quote from the classic film Gone With The Wind: 'Soon we will say Gone with the Measles,' according to ABC. 'My name is Rhett and I give a damn!' This isn't the first time Rhett and his family have spoken out. Last month his father, Carl, made headlines when he asked Rhett's school to bar any child from attending class if they had not been vaccinated because of the personal belief exemption. Rhett, who has been in remission for a year, is not yet strong enough to be immunized for a number of illnesses, including the measles. That means he depends on being surrounded by other children who are vaccinated - known as herd immunity - to keep him protected. But Martin County has one of the highest rates of personal belief exemption in the state, according to NPR. Rhett's family made headlines last month when his father Carl asked Rhett's school to bar any children from attending class if they had not been vaccinated because of the personal belief exemption . Rhett's Marin County, California school has a 7 per cent exemption rate - almost 5 per cent higher than the statewide average. At least 99 Californians have been infected with measles  after a Disneyland outbreak . Rhett's school clocks in at a 7 per cent exemption rate, almost 5 per cent higher than the statewide average. And now that a measles outbreak has hit California, with at least 99 cases reported after an infected child visited Disneyland, the possible danger Rhett faces has become all too real for his family. 'It's very emotional for me,' Carl Krewitt told NPR. 'If you choose not to immunize your own child and your own child dies because they get measles, OK, that's your responsibility, that's your choice. 'But if your child gets sick and gets my child sick and my child dies, then ... your action has harmed my child.' Carl also spoke to the school board on Thursday. 'Our culture emphasizes the individual story more than the need for people to see how their choices can infringe on the health of others,' he said, according to SFgate.com . 'We have an obligation to send a message. The risk of getting any of these diseases go far beyond our school.' Rhett finished his short speech by twisting a quote from the classic film Gone With The Wind: 'Soon we will say Gone with the Measles. My name is Rhett and I give a damn!' The Reed Union School District agreed and voted in support of the upcoming legislation that will be introduced by California Sen. Richard Pan, who is also a pediatrician. Pan said the bill will work to halt the spread of measles throughout the state, adding 'we want to raise the immunization rate so that we can protect children like Rhett and others'. California, which is one of 20 states to have personal belief exemption laws, has especially come under fire recently as the vaccination debate rages on. A recent investigation by Wired found that six out of 12 daycares at Silicon Valley tech companies, including Google, have below-average vaccination rates. There was a record number of measles cases last year, with 644 infections from 27 states, despite the fact that the disease was largely eradicated in 2000.

"Ukip are 'desperately' trying to secure a high profile Labour defection before the election – and have set their sights on selfie-loving councillor Karen Danczuk. Mrs Danczuk, who has become embroiled in a furious row with Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman over claims she dismissed the young activist as 'too pretty for politics, is standing down as a councillor in May. Ukip aides have privately admitted they would 'love' Mrs Danczuk – a working-class mother of two, who is married to the outspoken backbench MP Simon Danczuk – to defect. Scroll down for video . Red: She later posted these selfies on her Twitter saying: 'I'm Labour through and through! I even bought the underwear to prove it' The Rochdale councillor has revealed the behind-the-scenes bid to get her to switch. She told MailOnline: 'I'm not joining Ukip, but they are desperately trying.' A Ukip aide admitted the party were trying to convince Mrs Danczuk to join, but added: 'I don't know if it's desperate.' Mrs Danczuk last night insisted she would stay involved in Labour politics, despite stepping down from the council in May. She said: 'I'll still be hanging around and still at the sidelines. I just want to spend a little bit more time with my boys. 'My youngest was one when I first got elected. I want bed times, I want to be tucking them in every night, I don't want to be dashing out to meetings at night time for a while, and spend more time with my boys. The revelation that Ukip are trying to poach Mrs Danczuk comes after her MP husband Simon was forced to deny growing speculation that he was considering defecting to Ukip. Ukip leader Nigel Farage is trying to get Rochdale councillor Karen Danczuk to defect from Labour . The Rochdale MP, who has previously said Ed Miliband's leadership had been suicidal, was photographed drinking with Nigel Farage at the Anchor Tap pub near near Tower Bridge. Mr Danczuk, 48, is defending a majority of just 889, had attacked his party leader for 'torturous repetition of political mantras', warning this is turning voters away. But Mr Danczuk said there was 'no chance' he would join Ukip. He said: 'Nigel and I met for a few pints to talk about politics. 'We had a very detailed conversation about a whole range of things — Europe and immigration through to the general election and beyond.' At the time Mr Farage refused to discuss whether he had asked Danczuk to defect but said: 'I meet all sorts of people in politics. I was particularly pleased to meet Simon Danczuk. 'He is an interesting politician who thinks for himself. And he 'gets' why Ukip is doing so well in the North of England.' Mrs Danczuk, meanwhile, has escalated her public spat with Miss Harman – by demanding an apology for calling her a liar over claims she once told her she was 'too pretty to be in politics' and should join a girl band instead. Miss Harman allegedly made the remarks after being introduced to Mrs Danczuk for the first time. Slinky: She spent the morning trying on the slinky corset at bespoke lingerie shop Chantilly, in Rochdale . Ukip aides have privately admitted they would 'love' Mrs Danczuk – a working-class mother of two, who is married to the outspoken backbench MP Simon Danczuk – to defect . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman told MP's wife Karen Danczuk she was 'far too pretty to be interested in politics' and should join a girl band instead . It comes after the Labour shadow minister was accused of 'patronising' women after unveiling a bright pink women-only mini bus to attract female voters ahead of the election in May. Mrs Danczuk said Miss Harman's pink battle bus exposed politicians' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns. She said: 'What women voters want from politicians is their concerns heard in a serious manner. Not a patronising pink bus screaming drama queen!' Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman yesterday unveiled the pink, 16-seat minibus in Stevenage ahead of its tour 70 marginal seats in the run-up to the election . Mrs Danczuk later added: 'When I first met Harriet Harman she said I was far too pretty to be interested in politics & should be in Girls Aloud.' She told MailOnline: 'It was at a conference in Manchester. I wanted a photo with her and she said 'you're far too pretty to be in politics'. I suppose I've proved her wrong - I did go on to be a councillor.' But Miss Harman rejected the allegation. She said: 'I deny I ever said that and it's inconceivable I would have ever said that. 'I have always believed it's what you do in politics, not what you look like. I have never discouraged a woman from getting involved in politics on the basis of their looks.' The allegation sparked fresh accusations that Mrs Harman was belittling female voters. But Mrs Danczuk said she found the row 'upsetting' because she took the remark as a compliment. She told LBC's Iain Dale last night: 'It's really upsetting because I actually took it as a compliment. 'It was the conference where Gordon Brown first took over, everyone was excited – really, really happy. There always is a bit of a disco on one of the nights. 'It was the first time I'd ever met Harriet. So, I went over and said 'Harriet can I have a photograph'. 'She said 'yeah, yeah, of course, yeah'. So we had a little bit of a chit chat. She said 'what do you do?' and I said 'I'm a local party activist'. 'She said 'oh you're far too pretty to be in politics you should be in Girls Aloud. I actually took it as a compliment. 'I actually took it as a compliment, I wasn't insulted by it. I thought thank you that's actually really nice. Of course a women isn't going to be insulted by a compliment. 'But what does upset me is that she is saying I'm lying. I just think, if you didn't remember saying that to me then just say, 'I don't remember saying that but I'm glad that she's proved me wrong'. 'But to say that I'm lying, I just think, no, that's not very nice.' 'I'm sure she just thought, young, pretty party activist, give her a little compliment and that will be the end of it. I'm sure she never thought at the time that some years later it would come back and haunt her. Mrs Danczuk said Labour's pink battle van – which has been dubbed the Harriet's Barbie bus – exposed MPs' failure to listen seriously to voters' concerns . She added: 'Even to this day I took it as a compliment, but I do not appreciate being called a liar. That's what has upset me. There was no reason for me to lie about that. 'I think Harriet should apologise, because she is absolutely wrong and she's really upset me. I don't want it being a massive public spat – I'm telling the truth. Calling me a liar is absolutely wrong and the more she calls me a liar the more I won't let this drop. 'But if she turned up next week in her pink bus and said 'Karen, I'm sorry let's have a talk' I'd definitely welcome it. 'If she wants to apologise and come to Rochdale I'd welcome her with open arms.'","Exclusive: Mrs Danczuk says Ukip 'desperately trying' to get her to defect .

"Benedict Cumberbatch is set to marry his pregnant fiancée Sophie Hunter in a romantic ceremony today - and is believed to have asked his Sherlock co-star Martin Freeman to be his best man. The intimate wedding will take place in front of close friends and family in the sprawling grounds of a spectacular period property on the Isle of Wight. It is understood other guests will include actress Keira Knightley, who starred alongside Cumberbatch in the Imitation Game - the film which has earned the actor his first Oscar nomination.

If Freeman does step in as Cumberbatch's best man, it will be an echo of Sherlock - where Cumberbatch's Holmes stood up for Freeman's Watson in the TV wedding. News of the wedding comes just three months after their engagement was announced in Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times newspaper on November 5 and four weeks after confirming they are expecting their first child. It was previously reported that Sherlock star Benedict, 38, planned to marry theatre director Sophie before she gave birth. Speaking in January, a source told The Sunday Mirror: 'The invitations have gone out already, which is very quick. 'It's shocked a few people but they want their special day to happen before they have the baby. 'The details have been sent out in an email rather than a paper invitation as time is of the essence. Spotted: The pair were first seen watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June . The invitations are believed to be limited to family and close friends, all of whom have been sworn to secrecy about the location of the ceremony. The source added: 'They're planning the perfect day. Life couldn't be much better for them at the moment.' Benedict and Sophie have known each other for five years but dated for just five months prior to their engagement. The pair were first spotted watching the French Open tennis together in Paris in June. Tying the knot: News of the wedding comes just three months after their engagement was announced in Forthcoming Marriages section of The Times newspaper on November 5 . Since then, they have been seen having dinner together in London — entering and leaving the restaurant separately. They also attended the wedding of one of Benedict’s school friends last September. The actor and his fiancée are looking forward to becoming parents for the first time, but say they do not yet know the sex of the baby. A spokesperson for Benedict told MailOnline at the time: 'I am delighted to confirm that Benedict Cumberbatch and Sophie Hunter are expecting their first child. They are both over the moon.' Previously: Benedict’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012, after a romance lasting not quite a year . The New York Post's Page Six were the first to report that the Imitation Game star was 'delighted and excited about becoming a dad'. A source told the site: 'Sophie is a few months along, and both she and Benedict are very excited about it. They are also quietly planning to marry in early spring.' Benedict’s last serious girlfriend before Sophie was the fashion designer Anna Jones, from whom he separated in 2012, after a romance lasting not quite a year.

"Actress Helen Mirren said the Royals are 'vulnerable, complicated human beings' just like everyone else . Dame Helen Mirren has said the Royal Family live such bizarre lives they are like ‘aliens’. The actress, who has played the Queen four times, said the Royals’ inhabited a strange world but remained ‘the same flawed, insecure, vulnerable, complicated human beings’ as the rest of us. The 69-year-old, who earned an Oscar for her 2006 film portrayal of the monarch, told the New York Times: ‘The world they live in is so beyond our understanding. ‘You’ve never queued for anything. Ever, for anything. Every time you go in the street, the traffic is stopped for you. It’s a world you can’t imagine. They are, in a way, aliens. ‘But, inside that, they are the same flawed, insecure, vulnerable, complicated human beings we are. It’s my job to get into the person who’s inside that world.’ Dame Helen, who is reprising her role as the Queen in a Broadway play this weekend, said she was not a monarchist but a ‘queenist’. She added: ‘I think people misunderstand because she doesn’t smile all the time. But she’s not a movie star, she’s a queen. ‘Smiling is not a requirement. What’s required is to be dignified, to be almost iconic and self-controlled – not to be charming. ‘In the end, I prefer that to someone who smiles a lot and secretly has bulimia.’ Scroll down for video . Dame Helen first wore the crown as Queen Charlotte in The Madness of King George in 1994, before playing Elizabeth I in a TV series in 2005. She then took on the role of today’s monarch in the 2006 Stephen Frears film The Queen. Dame Helen, who was 59 when she made the movie, played Elizabeth II at the time of Princess Diana’s death - who was 71. In 2007, she turned down an invitation to have tea with the Queen because of filming commitments, but met Her Highness at Ascot the following year. The event was hosted by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh and included a specially commissioned theatre performance in the Ballroom, inspired by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Helen Mirren meets The Queen at a performing arts reception at Buckingham Palace in 2011 . The actress has played The Queen four times.

The play examines the Queen’s relationship with her Prime Ministers during the weekly audiences held every Tuesday at Buckingham Palace throughout her reign, beginning with Sir Winston Churchill. She transforms from the eager young Queen to the present day ‘grandmother of the nation’, to use a phrase from The Audience’s director Stephen Daldry.","Dame Helen Mirren says Royals are like 'aliens' for living such bizarre lives .

"The number of students taking foreign languages at university is in free fall (file picture) The number of students taking foreign languages at university is in free fall, with enrolment for French courses down by a quarter. Entrants for modern language degrees fell by 16 per cent from 2007 to last year, the Higher Education Statistics Agency reveals. Those studying German dropped by 34 per cent with only 615 enrolling on courses last year. Only 1,775 started a French degree course in 2013/14 and Italian student entries fell by 19 per cent. The Confederation of British Industry has previously warned that this lack of linguistic ability is acting as a 'tax on UK trade'. Part of the problem is fewer universities are offering language courses because they cost more to run than other subjects. Last summer's GCSE results showed that Spanish was the only one of three traditional languages to see a rise in entries, a move that some put down to the 'Messi impact' of high-profile Spanish-speaking personalities like Argentinian football star Lionel Messi fuelling youngsters interest in the subject. Vicky Gough, schools adviser at the British Council, said: 'The unfortunate reality is that language learning at university level is in decline with little to suggest that this is set to change any time soon. 'These latest figures are another blow for language lovers in the UK. It is particularly disappointing to see that even Spanish, a language that has generally bucked the trend in declining language take up at GCSE and A-level, has also seen an overall drop albeit at a less dramatic rate than French and German. 'If we are to compete in a global economy, we need more of our young people to be able to understand and embrace other languages in order to live and work in a globalised society, as well as to become the language teachers of the future. An international outlook has never been more important for the UK's place in the world - this starts with language learning.' Meanwhile the number of students applying for maths, business and biology degrees has grown, the statistics showed.","Number of students studying French at university falls by a quarter .

While these typically offer food priced from £45 to over £100, lunch at Caboose in the trendy Brick Lane area of London offers meals at a fraction of the price. Its burger menu of pulled pork, shredded beef and sides is cooked overnight by either restaurant owners James Bostock, Gandalf Roudette-Muschamp and Jim Cartwright or one of their three other members of staff. 1.

The trio, who opened up just 18 months ago, originally got together at a pub in late 2012 to brainstorm their new business idea after becoming disillusioned with their current careers. Mr Bostock, 29, read Law at the University of Leicester and had just completed a masters at the prestigious BPP Law School in Holborn, London. But things changed when he got together with his friends Mr Roudette-Muschamp, 30, and Mr Cartwright, 29, who he had known since the age of 13 when they started out at the University College School together in Hampstead, North London. Mr Bostock said: 'We were all at a particular point where we were either fed up with what we were currently doing or up for doing something entirely different. 'I'd just finished my master's degree and LPC in law and was pretty turned off by the idea of practice. The £5 'Fat Controller' burger consists of 10 hour pulled pork belly smoked for 10 hours over fruit wood chips and served with homemade BBQ sauce, oak lettuce, house pickles and smoked cheddar . The Brick Lane restaurant serves a stripped-down street food menu during the day. In the evening it hosts a hotly acclaimed three-course private meal for groups of eight to 12 people . 'Jim had his own Christmas tree operation, which was turning a good profit but was naturally quite seasonal and left him twiddling his thumbs for the rest of the year. 'Gandalf was and still is a music producer and tour manager with considerable skill in carpentry which would ultimately be the basis of building the Caboose. 'We knew we wanted to do something with food and soon realised that we didn't have the capital to even entertain the idea of going into a bricks and mortar restaurant. 'So we began looking at the London street food scene, which was, and still is, an incredibly burgeoning market. 'When we designed the Caboose we saw how we could set up a hybrid street-food eatery, which would sell street food during the day but also have the capacity to seat people for more extensive meals.' A caboose is a carriage at the end of a freight train which provides shelter for crew at the end of a train. Using Mr Cartwright's yard in Wembley they spent three months building their own Caboose before moving it to Brick Lane and opening for business in May 2013. Just 18 months later, they are rated higher than all 61 restaurants in the capital with at least one Michelin Star. The Caboose has two main sessions each day. It serves a stripped back 'street-food menu' during the day out of the hatch from midday until late afternoon and then hosts a hotly acclaimed three-course private meal in the cabin each evening from 8pm for £30 a head and groups of eight to 12 people who bring their own booze. Its gourmet burger menu centres mainly around its staple offerings of 10-hour apple wood-smoked pork belly, and 12-hour hickory-smoked shredded short rib of beef, which is slow cooked overnight.

Using Mr Cartwright's yard in Wembley the friends spent three months building their own Caboose before moving it to Brick Lane and opening for business in May 2013 . Mr Bostock said: 'At first we thought we would just be doing weddings and festivals but to be top on Trip Advisor is an amazing achievement. 'While we make no assumptions in the slightest that our food can compare to the level of gastronomy you might find at some of the Michelin star restaurants elsewhere in London, what we do offer is high-quality, simple, and above all tasty food with a dining experience unlike any other I know of in the capital. 'I think our rank on Trip Advisor is a reflection of how we are a bit of a different experience and we like a party atmosphere - it's the whole thing together that makes us a novelty that people love. 'At first we had no idea how the three-course meals in the cabin would be received. 'It's an incredibly unique space and due to its size is incredibly intimate. 'I personally work the majority of the bookings so I get to know each and every person that dines with us on an evening and it's great fun. Caboose's street-food menu during the day revolves around their signature burgers served in a toasted brioche bun: . The £5 'Fat Controller' burger consists of 10 hour pulled pork belly smoked for 10 hours over fruit wood chips and served with homemade BBQ sauce, oak lettuce, house pickles and smoked cheddar. 'The 3.10 To Yuma', at £5.50, is filled with 12-hour shredded flat rib of beef smoked over hickory and the same extras. Meanwhile, a third option is 'The Derailer', at £6, which is marketed as a mountainous mix of both their cuts of meat laced with their homemade hot sauce. Sides are also reasonably priced at just £1.50 a go, including rosemary, sea salt and black pepper twice-cooked fries, house salad and sweet maple slaw. One TripAdvisor review left on Monday night read: 'We booked Caboose for the evening which basically meant we had our own private restaurant! 'The food and service were amazing and it was great value. 'Since our visit every one of my friends that attended has mentioned how they can't stop thinking about the pulled pork/beef sandwiches!!' Another reviewer who visited Caboose last month wrote: 'The food is completely excellent. 'I'll leave it to previous reviews to explain what good pulled pork and beef is. 'Add to that great staff and the ability to bring far more booze than you need and you have a really excellent (and not very expensive) night out.'","Caboose received top marks on TripAdvisor website from every customer .

"The strange story of six brothers and one sister who grew up in New York but were never allowed out to explore the city's streets has become the subject of a new documentary. The Angulo siblings - Bhagavan, 23, twins Govinda and Narayana, 22, Mukunda, 20, Krisna, 18, Jagadesh, 17, and their sister Visnu - lived with their parents on welfare in a four-bedroom apartment in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Their father, Oscar, kept the front door locked and no one else was allowed a key. Home-schooled by their mother, the siblings found an outlet watching movies which gave them a taste, albeit a warped one, of the outside world. Scroll down for video . The Wolfpack: Director Crystal Moselle (center) with Mukunda, Govinda, Bhagavan, Narayana, Jagadisa  and Krisna Angulo from The Wolfpack, pictured last month at Sundance Film Festival . The siblings grew up with the confines of a four-bedroom apartment in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Although they were rarely allowed outside, they lived vicariously through watching movies . The lives of the Angulo family became the subject of film,The Wolfpack, from director Crystal Moselle. The documentary won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah last month. The six brothers and their mother Susanne also attended the premiere. Their sister, Visnu, who is the eldest and suffers developmental challenges, did not attend. The story emerged in 2010, when Ms Moselle met one of the brothers - then aged between 11 and 18 years old - on a rare escape into the outside world. Ms Moselle described first seeing the brothers, on First Avenue, when they were all walking in a 'pack', wearing sunglasses. Their look had been inspired by a favorite film, Reservoir Dogs. Ms Moselle said: 'It almost felt as if I had discovered a long lost tribe, except it was not from the edges of the world but from the streets of Manhattan.' The filmmaker befriended the boys, slowly earned the family's trust and was invited into their sheltered world, bringing her camera with her. Ms Moselle said that boy's mother, Susanne Angulo, slowly opened up to her but described father, Oscar, was a 'rollercoaster'. The documentary, which runs to one hour and 24 minutes, follows the siblings' isolated lives. 'All exceedingly bright, they have no acquaintances outside of their family and have practically never left home,' the film's press release reads. They fed their imaginations by meticulously re-enacting  favorite movies - works by Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan and Martin Scorcese among them. Their movie reconstructions were elaborate - at one point, two of the brothers recreated Batman: Dark Knight Rises' costumes out of no more than cereal boxes and yoga mats. The brother says: 'After I saw the Dark Knight, that made me believe that something was possible to happen. Not because it was Batman, it’s because it felt like another world. 'I did everything I could to make that world come true. To escape my world.' In all they had watched about 5,000 movies which were rented or bought cheaply. Mother Susanne, left, is the family's educator. A former hippie from the Midwest, she met her husband Oscar (right) on the trail to Machu Picchu in Peru. The father, who struggles with alcohol and paranoia, has kept his children inside for their whole lives because he believes they would be 'contaminated' by New York City . The siblings were given the outlet of movies in their confined lives - leading to elaborate reconstructions. In this picture, one brother stares from the family's apartment in his Batman costume, made entirely out of ceral boxes and yoga mats . Two of the brothers (dressed as Batman and Bane from The Dark Knight Rises) re-enact a scene from the movie in their Manhattan home . The Wolfpack in some of their amazingly elaborate costumes which they created based on their favorite films . Finally, one of the brothers escapes the home, and the clan is forced to readjust and begin taking their first steps into society. Ms. Moselle told The New York Times: 'It’s fascinating what the human spirit does when it’s confined. December 1989: Susan meets Oscar Angulo on the Machu Picchu trail in Peru. He acts as her guide, they fall in love and move to  U.S. January 1990: The couple travel the world . April 1990: They go to live in a Hare Krishna Center in West Virginia . October 1990: Visnu is born . Aug 1991: Baghavan is born in West Virginia . July 1992: Govinda & Narayana born in West Virginia . 1994: The family travels around the country in a van while Oscar tries to become a rock star . August 1994: Mukunda is born in LA while they are still living in a van . March 1995: The family moves to NYC for cheap housing - but the neighborhoods they end up in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn frighten them and they hear gunshots at night . May 1996: The family moves into a housing project on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Oscar forbids the mother and kids to go out alone . January 1997: Krisna is born in NYC . July 1998: Jagadisa is born in NYC . January 2010: Mukunda escapes the home wearing a Mike Meyers mask . April 2010: The brothers start leaving the home in their 'wolfpack' 'The downside to all the movies - and they have seen, like, 5,000 - is that there are certain formulas to them. 'Real life is different. In real life, the girl doesn’t always break your heart. The boys are still struggling to understand that.' The children come across as a likable and intelligent group in the film, despite their unimaginably sheltered lives. Their mother, Susanne, appears to have been controlled to the same extent that her children were. She is described as former hippie from the Midwest who is both the provider and educator for the family. She met her husband on the trail to Machu Picchu. Their father, Oscar, appears on briefly on camera. The Peruvian immigrant, who is devoted to Hare Krishna, appears caught in a struggle with paranoia and alcohol. The once aspiring musician, with a deep love for AC/DC, instilled his love of music in his sons and daughter. He believes that New York will 'contaminate' his children. However filmmaker Ms Moselle reserved judgement on Mr Angulo, telling The Times: 'The thing is, these brothers are some of the most gentle, insightful, curious people I’ve ever met. Something was clearly done right.' According to The Times, social services did have involvement at the home and the children have received some psychiatric treatment. In the film, all the siblings can be seen struggling with resentment towards their father for the life they have been forced to lead. Six of the siblings still live in the family's Lower East Side apartment - only Govinda Angulo has let home. (From left to right) Jagadisa, Govinda, Narayana, producer Izabella Tzenkova, associate producer Megan Delaney, the siblings' mother Susanne Angulo, director Crystal Moselle, Bhagavan, Jagadisa, and Mukunda  attend The Wolfpack premiere during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival at the Temple Theate in Park City, Utah . BHAGAVAN ANGULO, 23: The eldest of the brothers, he is a gentle soul who finds peace through meditation and yoga. He has joined a hip-hop conservatory where he is learning how to dance. GOVINDA, 22: One of the twins, he was the one of the brothers who wanted to assert his individuality the most from the pack, according to the filmmaker. He was the first and only brother to move out of the family home. Govinda now works as an AC on various productions and aspires to be a Director of Photography. NARAYANA, 22: He is interested in the environment and currently works for an anti-fracking organization. He is a voracious reader with an encyclopedic knowledge of film . MAKUNDA, 20: He is the unspoken leader of the brothers and the first to ever leave the apartment. The 20-year-old is an aspiring writer and director. His favorite holiday is Halloween and he spends the month of October preparing for a horror movie-thon and celebration. KRISNA, 17: With a quirky sense of humor, he loves to act out the movies the brothers watch. He is the most into music and 80s culture. JAGADESH, 16: The youngest brother, he is also taken a shine to the world's vices, 'emphasized by his cool guy bravado, 80s attire and hairdo', according to the filmmakers.","Bhagavan, Govinda, Narayana, Mukunda, Krisna, Jagadesh and their sister Visnu Angulo lived with their parents on Manhattan's Lower East Side .

"More than 1,000 British soldiers are taking part in Nato war games in Poland as part of a show of force against Russian President Vladimir Putin. The British Army's 'lead armoured battle group' of 1,350 troops and 100 armoured vehicles from the 3rd UK Division are participating in the Polish-led Nato exercise, the Ministry of Defence said. The commitment, Britain's largest to the region since 2008, is a bid to support allies in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States as part of a planned series of Nato manoeuvres throughout the autumn. Soldiers from the Kings Royal Hussars being shown around the turret of a Polish battle tank during the Nato exercise . These soldiers, from the 1st Battalion the Royal Welsh Regiment, are preparing for live firing, as part of the show of force against Vladimir Putin . The King's Royal Hussars (KRH), the UK's lead armoured battle group, operated 20 Challenger 2 Main Battle Tanks and conducted live battlefield scenarios alongside its Polish counterparts. Meanwhile the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh provided troops on the ground. The MoD said the exercised marked 'a significant demonstration of the UK's support to the region' as well as 'the British Army's ability to deploy an armoured battle group at short notice anywhere in the world in support of the nation's allies'. The move follows the early departure of Russian President Vladimir Putin from the G20 summit in Australia. Prime Minister David Cameron said the summit had sent a 'very clear message' to Mr Putin about the West's readiness to ramp up sanctions unless he took action to defuse the crisis in Ukraine. When the UK's commitment to the exercise was announced in July, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon criticised Russia's 'illegal annexation of Crimea and its destabilisation of eastern Ukraine'.

'It's important to put (the exercise) in the context of a raft of wider initial security measures on behalf of Nato to reassure our Eastern European allies of the importance of deterrence,' said Lieutenant Colonel Justin Kingsford, Commanding Officer of The KRH.

"In the social media war-of-words between Anthony Weiner and Andrew Cuomo, the governor was the clear victor. Disgraced former congressman Weiner put his foot in his mouth - again - on Friday, with a tweet that poked fun at Cuomo's dramatic decision last month to close the New York subways to prepare for one of the worst blizzards in the city's history - which never transpired. 'Sunday’s gonna be cold. Governor Cuomo will soon be closing the subway,' Weiner posted. However Cuomo's staffers were quick to fire back, with spokesman Rich Azzopardi replying: 'Yes, it is going to be cold. A good reason to keep your pants on.' Foot-in-mouth: No stranger to social media gaffes, Anthony Weiner posted this to Twitter on Friday . Ouch: Gov. Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi was quick to respond with this zinger . War-of-the-words: Current New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo (left) and disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (right) had a social media slinging match on Friday . Weiner, a New York Democrat, was caught engaging in sexual dalliances with young women who were not his wife on two separate occasions. However he refused to let the online burn slide. According to The New York Post, he wrote back using a referencing the corruption case against State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is accused of amassing millions of dollars in bribes. 'I have to be careful ­responding. I don’t want to be accused of witness tampering,' Weiner replied. Weiner resigned from his congressional seat in 2011 after a conservative news organization revealed that he had sent an explicit picture to a 21-year-old college student over his Twitter account. The married Congressman initially denied sending the lewd photo and suggested that he was the victim of a hack. Last laugh?: Weiner ended the tussle with this Tweet, referencing the Albany corruption investigation into State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver . Hitting back: Rich Azzopardi (left), media spokesman for Governor Andrew Cuomo, slammed Anthony Weiner in a Twitter comeback . But after the news organization, led by late conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, accused Weiner of sending a second photo of himself to another woman, Weiner confessed to carrying on with half a dozen women online over a three-year period both before and after his marriage to Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton. Less than two years after exiting Congress, Weiner attempted reenter politics by running for New York mayor. Early on in the Democratic primary the former congressman appeared to be on the verge of a political comeback. Three months later he found himself at the center of new sexting allegations, however. This time he was accused of having an secret relationship with a 22-year-woman named Sydney Leathers. Naughty: Sydney Leathers, then 22, was one of the young women who Weiner had inappropriate contact with after he exited Congress . Weiner acknowledged that he conversed with Leathers under the screen name Carols Danger from late 2012 right up to the time he announced his mayoral bid and to having sexual relationships online with up to 10 women but refused to drop out of the race. He quickly dropped to the back of the race, receiving just 4.5 percent of the vote when all was said and done.","Former congressman Anthony Weiner took a dig at Cuomo on Friday, tweeting that he 'will soon be closing the subway' because of weekend weather .

The 16-page handwritten and typed draft, which includes notes and deletions is to go under the hammer at Christie's in New York in April.

The original manuscript written by Don McLean for his iconic hit 'American Pie', which is set to go under the hammer at Christie's auction house in New York . Mr McLean, who is now 69, says he decided to sell the manuscript for the song, which he wrote in Cold Springs, New York and Philadelphia, on a whim. He has previously admitted that the beginning of the eight-minute tune is about the death of singer Buddy Holly, who died in a plane crash with Ritchie Valens and JP Richardson in 1959. However, he has been elusive about the meaning behind most of the lyrics, which has heightened interest and led to countless interpretations.

Mr McLean said: 'I wanted to capture, probably before it was ever formulated, a rock-and-roll American dream. Mr McLean, pictured in 1972, has been elusive about the meaning behind many of the lyrics in the song . 'The writing and the lyrics will divulge everything there is to divulge.' Francis Wahlgren, the international director of printed books and manuscripts at Christie's, said American Pie holds an important place in the history of music. He added: 'The fact that the drafts, the working process of it, are all being offered as this lot makes it a remarkable insight into the mind of Don McLean and into this incredible song that has touched so many people. 'There is something about this song that captures the era of that period and there is a kind of innocence to it, a loss of innocence in America.' However, the lot is not expected to break the record for a hand-written script after the original Bob Dylan lyrics for 'Like A Rolling Stone' sold for just over $2million at auction last year. It shattered the previous record of $1.2million for John Lennon's lyrics for 'A Day in the Life'. Mr Wahlgreen added: 'We've seen records double or triple for manuscripts in a matter of years because there has been a heightened interest in those very rare and truly significant manuscripts that come on the market.'","Original manuscript is to go under the hammer at Christie's in New York .

"Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond once appeared in an obscure Pakistani soap opera, it emerged today. Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in May, made a brief cameo appearance in 'The Castle' – a 15 part romantic thriller partially filmed in Scotland in 2001. The former SNP leader said he was even given acting lessons by the  Hollywood star Sean Connery before he made his acting debut. Alex Salmond, Scotland's former First Minister, made a brief cameo appearance in 'The Castle' – a 15 part Pakistani romantic thriller . He was approached to appear in the soap by SNP activist Tasmina Sheikh - the show's producer who is married to the famous Bollywood producer Sulfkar - when Mr Salmond stood down as party leader the first time when he was an MP in 2000. The soap was partly filmed partly at Scotland's Wedderburn Castle near Duns in the Borders. The plot follows an Asian businessman who marries a Scot and inherits her family home after her death. Mr Salmond plays a ghost who guides him through his troubles while at the castle. Despite the ghost's presence throughout the production, Mr Salmond's only personal appearance was in the last episode. Mr Salmond was approached to appear in the soap by SNP activist Tasmina Sheikh, the show's producer who is married to the famous Bollywood producer Sulfkar . Mr Salmond, who is standing for Parliament in May, was even name-checked in the soap opera's credits . Mr Salmond told BuzzFeed News: 'My Bollywood cameo as a ghostly spirit was filmed the last time I stood down as SNP leader. This time round I'm hoping to haunt the House of Commons, rather like Banquo's ghost. 'It was, it has to be said, a non-speaking role – not one I hope to assume in Westminster. 'As you would expect, I took some acting lessons from Sean Connery at the time to make sure the audience was both shaken and stirred.' The revelation comes as Mr Salmond plots his return to the House of Commons amid speculation he could even become Deputy Prime Minister in a Labour-led Government. Mr Salmond and his successor as First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have vowed to implement left-wing policies on Tory England if the SNP holds the balance of power after the next election. The former First Minister, who is standing for Parliament in May, said he would work with other parties except the Tories to 'see more progressive politics introduced across these islands'. Mrs Sturgeon yesterday gave a speech in London warning Labour that it would have to abandon 'failed' austerity policies and back a £180billion spending splurge to form a coalition with the SNP after the election. She said her party, which could hold the balance of power after May's general election, would require Ed Miliband to adopt a 'more moderate' approach to deficit reduction if he wanted the backing of SNP MPs in Westminster. The First Minister suggested an alternative approach for the next parliament which would see £180 billion extra spent on public services by 2020.","Former First Minister made brief cameo appearance in 'The Castle' in 2001 .

"A devoted husband has written his wife a love letter every single day for almost forty years, because he's 'crazy about her'. Bill Bresnan, 74, from Toms River, New Jersey, has penned more than 10,000 of the notes as a constant expression of his affection for Kirsten, also 74. Even when the couple are apart, Bresnan makes sure to mail the cards ahead of time to wherever she's going to be. Picture of devotion: Bill Bresnan has written his wife Kirsten, above, more than 10,000 love letters across four decades . Leafing through: The couple has kept every single letter and can look back on them to see what they were doing . Love letter: Above is one of the messages, dated June 1990, where Bresnan invites his wife on a boating trip . The pair met in 1974, when Kirsten enrolled in a finance class her husband-to-be was teaching. The letters, sporadic at first, soon followed. 'I'd mail a card from Chicago, a note from Los Angeles, a napkin from a restaurant in Boston. Into her scrapbook they went, and the collection took on a life of its own', he wrote in the Asbury Park Press. Since they married, the ritual became embedded, and Bresnan claims to have never missed a single day. 'I'm crazy about her - that's the only way I can describe it', he told ABC News. The huge cache of sentimental writings, each signed with two kisses and an infinity symbol, is now stored in 25 neatly-filed boxes in the couple's attic. Storage: There are now so many letters that the Bresnans store the huge mass of love notes in their attic . Chronological: Thanks to meticulous record-keeping, the cards are organised in date order, and chronicle four decades . As well as keeping their relationship strong day-by-day, the chronological collection also offers them a window into the past. Bresnan said: 'They're essentially a love diary. For example, I could pick out a day in 1982, and it’ll begin with the restaurant we ate in or a movie we saw and then a reaction to that.' Even major obstacles, such as when both Bresnan, and later his wife, were diagnosed with cancer, have not broken the daily tradition. Kirsten, who often writes letters back to her husband 'not every day, but very often', says that the ever-growing collection 'mean everything to me'. According to Bresnan, his romantic formula is part of his efforts to keep his marriage as strong as possible. He told ABC: 'The key to any relationship is that you both have to work at it every day.' 'And never go to bed mad. Talk about everything. Everything should get resolved before your goodnight kiss.' Homestead: The couple lives together in Toms River, New Jersey .","Bill Bresnan, 74, has written more than 10,000 letters to Kirsten .

"Etiquette expert William Hanson says that women need to be more accepting of chivalry . In a world where one-night-stands, booty-calls, cheating and the like are more prevalent than ever, it is perhaps easy to see why chivalry is, if not quite dead, then clinging on precariously on life-support. We are all a bit to blame for allowing this noble art to fade but what has not helped is the total confusion that men still have over what is acceptable and what is not. The oft-lampooned bra-burning brigade (the ones who socially style themselves Ms. Sara Parker with no irony whatsoever) have spent so many years screeching from their parapets that any man with a sense of decency is at a loss as to what is now correct. 'If I hold this door open for her, will she launch into a lecture?' 'Should I remain seated when she gets up to use the restaurant loo just to keep the peace?' A few loud-mouthed 'wimmin' (as they would have us spell it) have ruined it for the rest of us. Chivalry can be dated back to the mid-twelfth century and while early codes focused on mares of the equine variety and included tips on how to wear your armour, today chivalry is about how a man treats a woman. But listen, girls. Men really aren't holding doors open for you because we think you'll break into a sweat if we let you muster the energy to do it yourselves. Equally, we're not pulling your chairs out because they are so heavy you may chip an over-adorned nail if you try to shift it solo. We do it because it is the nice thing to do. We men would love a bit of attention to be focused on us in a similar way from time to time (and indeed with modern chivalry doors should get held open by whoever reaches them first… although on a date, chaps, make sure that's you). Men and women are different. Vive le difference! Most ladies should be secure enough now to not worry that accepting a man's coat   means she will have her right to vote revoked with immediate effect. It is the opposite of chivalry (and good manners) for a woman/womyn/wimmin to bark at the man for playing the gallant knight. A first date is usually a pretty terrifying experience anyway, what won't help it go well if any party starts belittling the views or actions of the other. Those 'wimmin' who don't appreciate chivalrous acts probably aren't worth dating, he adds . Due to this complete lack of knowing what is now acceptable, men now can be seen on dates awkwardly and clumsily sitting down first - before the lady - knowing that they have just committed a faux pas but have at least avoided an argument. And it is that last word that is to blame. The age of feelings we now share has brought on the demise of chivalry. There are still some of these insecure women about. You may even end up courting one this weekend. So what acts of chivalry should we men contemplate? My advice is do it all! Pull out all the stops on your next date. If she doesn't like it, is she really worth dating? A true lady would never rebuke their companion publicly or so soon after the unintended transgression. Girls – if you really, really don't like it then firstly, get over yourself, and secondly, just have a quiet word with them at a later stage – politely say that you appreciate the sentiment but you can manage. Most level-headed people will enjoy and respect little acts of courtesy. If, and this is for the male readers, you find yourself paired with a Ms. then it is probably best to leave it there. See the date out – to walk out or act bored will only be stooping to her level – but make sure you are unavailable for future engagements with her. She clearly doesn't want the company of men and so should get used to not having it. RISE UP . A gentleman should always rise from his seat when a lady arrives or leaves the table (for example, to go to the lavatory). That said, in correct etiquette a woman (or man) does not leave the table until the end of the meal. But should the lady need to nip to the loo mid-meal then the time to do it in a restaurant or hotel dining room is after the main course, before the pudding. And ladies – please leave the table quickly so we men aren't left standing for long. Get up and go! SEAT WITH A VIEW . Table for two? Position the lady in the seat where she will have the best view of the restaurant and wont get stuck looking at the wall. If you are meeting your date at the restaurant then a nice touch is for the man to arrive beforehand and check the table is satisfactory and you aren't going to be stuck next to the door to the kitchen. ORDER LAST: PAY FIRST . Properly trained waiters should ask for the lady's order first, before the man's, but if you are eating in a less than excellent eatery then ask your date to give her order before yours. The man, on a first date, should always pay… unless it's gone horrifically badly in which case there may be a case for you both 'going Dutch'. For the second date onwards, whoever initiates the date should pay. GET YOUR COAT . Walking to a bar for a postprandial drink? Is your date shivering? Even though it is probably caused by her insufficient dress, a man should offer his coat to drape over the woman. (As a side note, men, don't think you'll impress your date by showing how 'hard' you are by leaving the house in just a shirt. Compensating much?) BE HONEST . Let's face it, not all dates are going to end with a marriage and 2.4 children, or even get close to. If something isn't working then both parties owe it to each other to be honest and grown-up about the situation rather than protracting things with smoke and mirrors.","William Hanson says Valentine's day is the perfect time to be chivalrous .

The 30-year-old was pictured skiing in the Swiss resort with a group including cousins Princess Eugenie, in a blue jacket with black helmet, and Beatrice, 26, in a white jacket and grey helmet. Eugenie, 24, wrapped up in a bright blue ski jacket and salopettes while Harry, 30, looked sporty in a black ski jacket and beige trousers. Scroll down for video .

Price Harry (centre, in the blue helmet), pictured in Verbier along with Princess Eugiene (right, in the blue jacket) and Princess Beatrice (left, in the white jacket) Thanks their safety-conscious helmets and sunglasses, the royals were barely recognisable so drew little attention as they skied in the sunshine. After enjoying themselves on the slopes, the group took a break from skiing when they reached the Le Carrefour restaurant which boasts a sheltered dining terrace and 'great views over Verbier' on its website. Verbier is famously popular with the rich and famous, with Virgin tycoon Richard Branson among those to own a home there. Unusually, his chalet, known as The Lodge, can be booked through his travel company Virgin Unlimited by paying guests, although a stay costs up to CHF 172,910 (£120,000) per week. Princess Eugenie wore a bright blue ski jacket and black salopettes . Harry, far right, is pictured on the slopes with a group of friends . The group paused for a chat outside a restaurant in the luxury resort . Another Verbier chalet owner is Prince Andrew, who was in the resort with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson and their two daughters for New Year. They were joined on that occasion by Cressida Bonas, who, like Prince Harry, has long been a fan of the resort. Indeed, it was during Harry's 2013 trip to the resort that he went public about their relationship and was spotted canoodling with the aristocratic blonde on the ski slopes. This year there were no hugs and kisses for Harry on the slopes, although thanks to the presence of Beatrice, Eugenie and their friends, he had no shortage of company.

Flashback: Eugenie on the same slopes in Verbier back in 1997 when she was a little girl along with sister Beatrice and their parents Prince Andrew and Fergie . The British royals also had a group of blue-blooded holidaymakers from another country to keep them entertained on the piste. Earlier this week, members of the Danish royal family were pictured enjoying a break from official duties on a family ski holiday. Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Crown Princess Mary, 43, are staying at the resort with their four children Prince Christian, nine, Princess Isabella, seven, and four-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine. Unlike Harry and Eugenie, the Danish royals have chosen to spend their time away from the black runs and are indulging in a spot of child-friendly tobogganing instead.

"At least 19 people have been killed and 60 others injured after Taliban militants launched a savage suicide bomb and gun attack on a Shi'ite mosque in Pakistan. The radical Sunni Islamists stormed the mosque in Peshawar - close to the Afghan border - during  Friday prayers this afternoon and fired automatic weapons at random, local police said. Amid the ensuing chaos three suicide bomb blasts were heard inside the mosque, which the Taliban are understood to have targeted because they think Shi'ites are not true Muslims. The Pakistani Taliban, who are fighting  to set up a hardline Sunni theocracy in the country, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it was revenge for Pakistan's crackdown on militants following a massacre at a school in the city that killed 145 people, including 132 children. Scroll down for video . Carnage: The radical Sunni Islamists broke in to the mosque in Peshawar - close to the Afghan border - during Friday prayers this afternoon and fired automatic weapons at random, local police said . Volunteers move an injured Shi'ite worshipper to a hospital following the attack by Taliban militants . Police said armed men broke into the mosque, where people were attending Friday prayers, and opened fire, following which three explosions were heard inside the building. 'Either Pakistan will become your graveyard, or God's law, sharia, will be implemented,' Taliban commander Khaleefa Omar Mansoor said in a video in which he was flanked by three young militants clutching AK-47 assault rifles. 'This is the first in a series of revenge attacks... Wait for the rest,' Mansoor, who had earlier claimed responsibility for the December 16 school attack in which more than 150 people were killed, said in the video sent by email to reporters. The style of the mosque attack was similar to that of the school attack, when gunmen arrived in a car, set it on fire, and broke into the building using a back entrance. Peshawar's Hayatabad Medical Complex said at least 19 people had been killed in the latest attack. Devastation: Police said armed men broke into the mosque, where people were attending Friday prayers, and opened fire, following which three explosions were heard inside the building . Wounded: A badly injured man is carried out of the building by the building following the attack . The head of the provincial police, Nasir Durrani, said four or five attackers entered the mosque from a building next door that was under construction, then jumped over an outer wall into the mosque courtyard. One person then blew himself up, creating a diversion so the other attackers could enter the mosque, Durrani said. He said at least three attackers died in the violence - two by blowing themselves up, and a third was killed by worshippers at the mosque. 'People here showed great courage. They grabbed one of the attackers from his neck, and he couldn't detonate (his explosives), and he was shot and killed,' Durrani added. Authorities were still examining the scene, and Durrani did not say what happened to the remaining attacker or attackers. Some people who fled the mosque reported that at least some of the attackers were wearing security uniforms. 'The prayer was about to end when a big bang happened, followed by dust and smoke. I have seen amid the smoke that one guy dressed in police uniform was firing shots and then there was another blast,' said one of the wounded, 22-year-old Syed Javed Hasan, speaking from his hospital bed. Locals comfort a local woman after this morning's savage suicide bomb and gun attack on a Shi'ite mosque . At least 19 people were killed and 60 others injured after Taliban militants launched the attack on a Shi'ite mosque in the Pakistani city of Peshawar during Friday prayers this afternoon . The head of the provincial police, Nasir Durrani, said four or five attackers entered the mosque from a building next door that was under construction, then jumped over an outer wall into the mosque courtyard . A witness, Shahid Hussain, said that Shi'ite worshippers had just finished prayers when five or six men wearing military uniforms broke into the mosque and started shooting. 'We had no idea what was going on. One of the attackers then blew himself up and then there was huge smoke and dust all around,' he said. The attack came as Pakistan tries to adopt new measures to tackle militants following the school massacre, in which 134 children were among the dead. The government has pledged to crack down on all militant groups, and has reintroduced the death penalty, set up military courts to speed convictions and widened its offensive in northwestern areas on the Afghan border where militants find refuge. Yet Pakistan's religious minorities, among them Ahmadis, Christians and Hindus, say the government is doing little to alleviate their daily struggle against discrimination and violence. Last month, dozens of people were killed in a similar attack on a Shi'ite mosque in the southern town of Shikarpur.","Taliban militants stormed the mosque in Peshawar during Friday Prayers .

"Facebook has locked out Native Americans from using the social network after deeming their names to be fake. Several users, including Dana Lone Hill, Shane and Jacqui Creepingbear and Parmelee Kills The Enemy have had their accounts suspended or even deleted. Users from indigenous tribes have received messages asking them to change their legal names to ones that do not 'violate [the company's] standards'. A Native American Indian dressed in traditional regalia watches during the Grand Entry of the National Powwow in Washington D.C.: Several Native American users have had their accounts suspended or even deleted by Facebook . Facebook's 'real name' policy states: 'We require people to provide the name they use in real life; that way, you always know who you're connecting with.' Dana Lone Hill, a Lakota whose mother's surname is Lone Hill, and father's is Lone Elk, sent three forms of identification to Facebook so the company could 'investigate' whether she was a real person. 'I had a little bit of paranoia at first regarding issues I had been posting about until I realized I wasn't the only Native American this happened to,' she wrote. 'One friend was forced to change his name from his Cherokee alphabet to English. 'Another was forced to include her full name, and a few were forced to either smash the two word last names together or omit one of the two words in the last name. 'Oglala Lakota Lance Brown Eyes was booted from Facebook and when he turned in his proof of identification they changed his name to Lance Brown,' she claims. After writing about her issue, Dana had her account reinstated, with facebook claiming it was 'a mistake'. To reestablish a Facebook account after being accused of using a fake name, users must submit one government-issued ID such as a birth certificate, passport or voter identification card or two other forms of identification such as library card and a yearbook photo. The struggle with Native American names comes after the Facebook's chief product officer, Chris Cox, had to apologise after the company refused to recognise names of some LGBT members. Their accounts were shut down after they had used stage names that they are known by in communities such as drag circles. A Facebook spokesperson had said: 'Over the last several months, we've made some significant improvements in the implementation of this standard, including enhancing the overall experience and expanding the options available for verifying an authentic name. 'We have more work to do, and our teams will continue to prioritize these improvements so everyone can be their authentic self on Facebook.' Shane Creepingbear has a similar problem with his wife, and told colorlines the couple's ordeal came to a swift end when he had some friends who work in the tech industry contact Facebook directly. Shane, who's part of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, says that he and Jacqui have 'administrative shields' on their Facebook accounts and that their names will no longer be questioned. 'It's a problem when someone decides they are the arbiter of names,' says Shane. 'It can come off a tad racist. 'While FB can set the Terms and Conditions for use of its products positioning itself as the arbiter of what names are real smacks of bigotry.'","Users told their legal names 'violate [the company's] standards'

"Argentina has passed a new law stating that all public transport and stations must display the inflammatory words: 'The Falklands are Argentina'. The new regulation was approved unanimously in parliament last night after it was proposed by MP Teresita Luna. Daniel Filmus, secretary of state for Falkland affairs, tweeted the announcement, saying: 'Public transport will carry the message #LasMalvinasSonArgentinas, an initiative from @terelunalarioja approved unanimously.' Argentina's football team poses with a banner reading 'The Falklands are Argentina' which will now be marked on all public transport and stations in the country after a law was voted in unanimously in parliament . The law, part of more than 60 public transport measures, means all vehicles on road, rail, water or in the air must be marked with the phrase, it was reported by The Daily Telegraph. However, some Argentines took issue with the move, with one tweeting: 'Haven't you got anything more urgent to deal with?' Ms Luna, 41, a politician from La Rioja province in the west of the country near the border with Chile. Given her distance from the British territory, it is not clear why she has been the forerunner for the vote. However, the campaign #LasMalvinasSonArgentinas has been gathering traction in recent months. In July, Argentina's football chiefs were fined £19,500 by FIFA after their players posed with a political banner laying claim to the Falkland Islands. The players stood behind the slogan ‘Las Malvinas son Argentinas’ (the Falklands are Argentinian) at a June 7 friendly against Slovenia in Buenos Aires. Clarkson and the Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina this summer after the outspoken presenter was spotted driving around the country with a number plate believed to reference the Falklands War of 1982 . The world governing body opened disciplinary proceedings against the AFA last month following the controversial incident. The message was displayed in support of an on-going campaign to claim sovereignty of the islands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean. A statement from FIFA said the AFA had been fined and issued with a reprimand after it was deemed to be in breach of Article 60 of the FIFA stadium safety and security regulations ('political action') and Article 52 of the FIFA disciplinary code ('team misconduct'). It also comes after a furious row erupted when Jeremy Clarkson was spotted driving through Argentina with a number plate H982 FKL which some claimed a reference to the Falklands War. The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.' Alicia Castro, the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, demanded an apology from BBC head of television Danny Cohen during a meeting this month - which the corporation refused to give.","Law was approved unanimously in parliament after proposal by MP .

"SAS troops with sniper rifles and heavy machine guns have killed hundreds of Islamic State extremists in a series of deadly quad-bike ambushes inside Iraq, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Defence sources indicated last night that soldiers from the elite fighting unit have eliminated ‘up to eight terrorists per day’ in the daring raids, carried out during the past four weeks. Until now, it had been acknowledged only that the SAS was operating in a reconnaissance role in Iraq and was not involved in combat. But The Mail on Sunday has learned that small groups of soldiers are being dropped into IS territory in RAF Chinook helicopters – to take on the enemy. Scroll down for video . DRONES PATROL IRAQ TO SEEK OUT TARGETS: Drone operators study footage of the terrorists’ positions which are then relayed to SAS commanders at their secret base so they can plan missions . Targets are identified by drones operated either from an SAS base or by the soldiers themselves on the ground, who use smaller devices. The troops are also equipped with quad bikes – four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles that can have machine guns bolted on to a frame. They then seek out IS units and attack the terrorists using the element of surprise and under the cover of darkness. The missions have taken place on a near daily basis in the past four weeks and the SAS soldiers have expended so much ammunition that regimental quartermasters have been forced to order a full replenishment of stocks of machine-gun rounds and sniper bullets. An SAS source said: ‘Our tactics are putting the fear of God into IS as they don’t know where we’re going to strike next and there’s frankly nothing they can do to stop us. SAS SNIPER UNITS SCRAMBLED IN CHINOOKS: The heavily equipped troops are flown deep into IS territory aboard RAF transport helicopters, their quad bikes stowed on board, before touching down 50 miles from their target . ‘We’re degrading their morale. They can run and hide if they see planes in the sky but they can’t see or hear us. Using so many snipers takes the fear factor to another level too; the terrorists don’t know what’s happening. They just see their colleagues lying dead in the sand.’ The SAS’s guerrilla-style raids are targeting IS’s main supply routes across western Iraq and vehicle checkpoints set up by the terrorists to conduct kidnappings and extort money from local drivers. The operations start with SAS commanders studying hours of footage of potential target sites recorded by drones – Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) – and listening to enemy communication intercepts in a bid to identify IS leaders. Once the regiment’s senior officers have identified a target, the soldiers gather to receive their operational orders. They then leave their secret base and climb aboard a fleet of helicopters – with the quad bikes already safely secured in the cargo hold. As the SAS soldiers strap themselves into their seats, the pilots tap in the co-ordinates for the area of desert where the Chinook will land. As the helicopters’ engines are so loud, the Chinooks take the SAS soldiers to a laying-up point as far as 50 miles from the target. The troops disembark aboard the quad bikes and prepare their general- purpose machine guns (GPMGs) and Barrett sniper rifles. IS PICKED OFF IN GUERILLA-STYLE RAIDS: Using precision sniper rifles, machine guns and surprise tactics, the SAS take out their IS targets before disappearing back into the desert . The SAS’s raids are intended to degrade Islamic State’s fighting capability ahead of a spring offensive by 20,000 Iraqi and Kurdish troops next year, with the UK providing additional training for these soldiers. In the next fortnight, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon is expected to receive a report from British military planners setting out what needs to be done. The plans could see up to 300 UK trainers leading a programme of intensive training for the Kurds and Iraqis, with an emphasis on infantry drills and techniques to defuse enemy explosive devices. When the spring offensive starts, British trainers may remain with the Iraqi and Kurdish units but are not expected to get directly involved in the fighting. Earlier this month, Mr Fallon held meetings with political leaders in the region, assuring them that the UK was committed to defeating IS and improving the training of their soldiers. The Defence Secretary also visited Kuwait, where it is expected that US and British commanders will set up a spring offensive planning centre. The mission to defeat the 200,000-strong IS forces will be led by a senior US officer, Lieutenant General James Terry. It is likely that his second in command will be a senior British officer, Lieutenant General Tom Beckett. Next month Lieut Gen Beckett will take over as Defence Senior Adviser for the Middle East (DSAME), a post vacated by Lieutenant General Simon Mayall, who is retiring after four years in the role. Defence sources indicated last night that soldiers from the elite fighting unit have eliminated ‘up to eight terrorists per day’ in the daring raids, carried out during the past four weeks . But Middle East experts are questioning whether the UK’s strategy to defeat IS stands any chance of success. Professor Gareth Stansfield from Exeter University told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Not only is the Islamic State stronger than previous organisations, it has also learned lessons from them. ‘For example, IS has few fixed operational centres and its chain of command remains mobile. British policy options at this stage are burdened with problems and complications and also bring with them a range of unintended consequences that could draw Western powers into further engagements in the region. ‘With regard to the spring offensive, the Kurds would not be able to push further south into Iraq without upsetting the Sunni tribesmen in these areas and the Iraqi army is regarded as a Shia militia. So we are a long way off a practical solution to the problem of IS.’ The Mail on Sunday has learned that since IS began its campaign in Syria and Iraq, more than 35 British jihadists have lost their lives. It is believed the most recent UK citizens to die fighting for the extremists – known as Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, 21, and Abu Dharda, 20 – were from London. They are understood to have been killed in US air strikes on the Syrian border town of Kobane. Al-Habashi grew up in North London in a British-Eritrean family and converted to Islam when he was 16. In August, al-Habashi told the BBC he had gone to Syria nine months earlier and had been fighting both there and in Iraq. Al-Habashi is thought to have appeared in at least two IS videos posted online. Dharda comes from a British-Somali background and grew up in West London. He travelled to Syria in December 2013, entering via Turkey. It is believed that Dharda was questioned by counter-terrorism police at a British airport as he left but was allowed on his journey because they were satisfied with the explanation he gave for the purpose of his trip. Intelligence sources have indicated that more than 500 Britons are currently fighting for IS, with the vast majority active in Syria. Yesterday, the widow of murdered British aid worker Alan Henning told a memorial service he was killed ‘for being what we should be, selfless and caring’. A video showing the beheading of the 47-year-old taxi driver was released by IS last month. A private memorial service at Eccles parish church in Greater Manchester was held yesterday, with audio relayed outside. His widow Barbara and daughter Lucy walked in with Bethany and Michael Haines, the daughter and brother of David Haines from Scone, Scotland, also murdered by IS. Mrs Henning told the memorial: ‘We must never forget the reason why he went to Syria and the reason he was taken from us – for being what we all should be, selfless and caring.’ Meanwhile, IS militants have killed at least 25 members of a Sunni Muslim tribe in a village on the eastern edge of Ramadi in Iraq, in apparent revenge for tribal opposition to the radical Islamists. Local officials said the bodies of the men from the Albu Fahd tribe were discovered by the Iraqi army when it launched a counter-offensive on Saturday against IS near Ramadi, capital of Anbar province. 'Red Cap tragedy' General set to lead offensive . NEW MAN: Lieut General Tom Beckett . A former Parachute Regiment officer who was in charge of six Red Caps brutally killed by a mob of extremists in Iraq is in line to become the second in command of coalition operations against IS. Lieutenant General Tom Beckett has been appointed Defence Senior Adviser for the Middle East (DSAME) and will take up his position as the UK steps up its efforts to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces to defeat Islamic State. Softly spoken Lieut Gen Beckett first deployed to Iraq in 2003, when the tragedy of the Red Caps marked the beginning of an insurgency against the British presence in the country’s southern provinces. At the time, the Red Caps, or Royal Military Policemen, were attached to the Parachute Regiment’s 1st Battalion led by Beckett. Eleven years on, families of the Red Caps still blame senior officers for their deaths. Lieut Gen Beckett is taking over as DSAME following the retirement of Lieutenant General Simon Mayall – an officer who was considered the British Army’s leading expert on Arab affairs. Lieut Gen Mayall served as DSAME for four years but his retirement comes only three months after the Prime Minister also appointed him to serve as his special envoy to Kurdistan – a key role during the IS crisis. Last night, Middle East expert Professor Gareth Stansfield described Lieut Gen Mayall’s retirement as a ‘blow’ because of his understanding of regional politics and jihad philosophy.","Targets are identified by drones operated by SAS soldiers .

"Aretha McAdoo, 43, from Platte County, Missouri, now faces up to a year in jail after being charged with child endangerment . A four-year-old girl overdosed on red wine after being left in the care of her social worker grandmother, authorities say. Aretha McAdoo, 43, from Platte County, Missouri, now faces up to a year in jail after being charged with child endangerment. Her granddaughter was allegedly left alone with a box of wine and drank the lot, giving her a blood alcohol content of 0.159 - more than twice  the legal limit for adults. McAdoo reportedly called emergency services when she returned to the kitchen and found her granddaughter passed out. She apparently didn't tell medics what the child had consumed. However, responders realized what had happened after smelling alcohol in the girl's vomit. The girl was taken to Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City where it is believed she made a full recovery. Adam Algreen, a medical toxicologist at the facility, warned that the situation could have proved fatal. Even a cup full of wine can be problematic to a small child. 'With increasing severity children get more sleepy and can actually go into coma and become unconscious and not breathe,' Algreen told Fox News. The incident took place on December 16 and the case went to court this week. McAdoo said she was mortified by what had happened. Scene of the incident: McAdoo's granddaughter was allegedly left alone with a box of wine and drank the lot, giving her a blood alcohol content of 0.159 - more than twice the legal limit for adults . Underfire: According to police, McAdoo appeared to have trouble balancing and was slurring her words when emergency services arrived . 'This is an accident. My grandbaby got into something that I was drinking, which is wine,' she said. According to police, McAdoo appeared to have trouble balancing and was slurring her words when emergency services arrived. However, she insists she only had one glass of wine before leaving her grandchild alone with the remainder of the box. She was looking two other grandchildren at the time. McAdoo said she regularly looked after the brood and every week they would visit her at home or they would go to the library. It was not immediately clear if McAdoo has an attorney.","Aretha McAdoo, 43, from Platte County, Missouri, now faces up to a year in jail after being charged with child endangerment .

"Abandoning any claims to an insanity defense, a Vermont woman pleaded guilty Thursday to strangling to death a popular local science teacher in 2012. At a mental competency hearing, a judge found Patricia Prue capable of rational decisions before she pleaded guilty to aggravated murder in the death of St. Johnsbury Academy teacher Melissa Jenkins. Prue, 35, admitted she strangled the 32-year-old Jenkins, who prosecutors say was lured to her death with a ruse about a broken down car. Guilty: Patricia Prue, 35, pleaded guilty Thursday to aggravated murder in the 2012 strangulation death of St. Johnsbury Academy teacher Melissa Jenkins in Vermont . Victim: Jenkins, 35, a science teacher and single mother of one, was beaten, strangled to death by the Prues and dumped in a river in March 2012 . Arriving in Caledonia Superior Court dressed in a grey sweatshirt and brown pants, with her once-long hair cropped short, Prue explained to the judge why she was accepting the plea deal. ‘Your honor, my answer to the question is that I would like to remain where I am, um, for the rest of my life,’ said Prue. ‘And that's why I'm doing it. Thank-you.’ She also said she wanted to plead guilty so that she could resume written contact with her husband Allen Prue, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the case. As co-defendants, the two weren't allowed to communicate while the charges were pending. Prue's sudden decision to drop her insanity claims and change her plea to guilty took both the defense and the prosecution by surprise Thursday, as both sides had been busy preparing for a lengthy trial, according to Burlington Free Press. ‘It just happened so quickly today I'm still digesting it but I'm very pleased,’ said prosecutor Lisa Warren. ‘I know that it's been a long time for the family and the community awaiting this day so, I'm very happy with it.’ Mr Prue was found guilty in October of first-degree murder, conspiracy and attempted kidnapping in the death. Pen pals: Patricia Prue (left) said she wanted to plead guilty so that she could resume written contact with her husband Allen Prue (right), who is serving a life sentence in the case . Blame game: Prue (left) pointed a finger of blame at his wife (right) and said during his sentencing that he was convicted for a crime he did not commit . At his sentencing in December, Prue, who had a snowplow business and had plowed Jenkins' driveway, blamed his wife for the crime. The 32-year-old convicted killer said he felt terrible for what happened but claimed he was convicted of a crime he didn't commit. 'One thing I am guilty of is bringing this person who is responsible for this crime to Vermont,' he said tearfully. But the judge rejected the defense arguments that Allen played a minor role in the crime. He said Prue and his wife were 'a pair hunting their prey.' 'The attack was committed with suddenness and ferocity,' he said. 'And Miss Jenkins was driven to the ground. The court does conclude that the attack was primarily driven by Mr. Prue, who has the strength ... and he was able to drive her to the ground and choke her out' although he may have not delivered the fatal choking. Authorities say Allen Pruse told police he and his wife wanted 'to get a girl.' Patricia Prue is to be sentenced Friday. She faces life in prison without parole. Prosecutors say the Prues planned the crime: Patricia Prue's computer had been used to conduct online searches for 'how to kidnap a girl,' the Prues got a stun gun and they bought a prepaid cellphone to call Jenkins to ask for help. Orphaned: The single mother was reported missing after her vehicle was found that day idling on a rural road with her 2-year-old son inside . They say the Prues lured Jenkins from her home March 25, 2012, with the tale about car trouble, strangled and beat her and dumped her body in the Connecticut River. Before disposing of the body, the Prues removed all of Jenkins' clothes, poured bleach on the corpse and wrapped her in a tarp. The single mother was reported missing after her vehicle was found that day idling on a rural road with her 2-year-old son inside. Her body was found in the river the next day. Police were led to the Prues after a Jenkins' friend told them Jenkins said she was suspicious after the Prues called her about their vehicle. They also found a business card for Allen Prue at Jenkins' home.","Patricia Prue, 35, pleaded guilty to aggravated murder in the death of St. Johnsbury Academy teacher Melissa Jenkins in 2012 .

"Iraqi security forces killed eight ISIS assailants disguised in Iraqi Army uniforms during an attack Friday against an air base where 320 U.S Marines are currently training Iraqi troops, military officials said. The strike on the Ain al-Asad base, which is currently being plummeted with rocket fire, came after insurgents from the Islamic State took Al-Baghdadi, a neighboring town only nine miles away from the base. They launched their offense on the base after poor weather halted air strikes, led by eight suicide bombers who were followed by an additional 15 men. This as the U.S. has retaliated by bringing in helicopter gunships to support Iraqi ground forces battling ISIS militants in al-Baghdadi, drawing them closer to combat with the terrorist organization. Scroll down for video . Iraqi security forces  killed eight ISIS assailants wearing Iraqi army uniforms during an attack today against the Ain al-Asad air base, where 320 U.S. Marines are currently training Iraqi troops . Although the facility has been re-secured, ISIS took control of neighboring town Al-Baghdadi this morning and are now pummeling the air base with rocket fire and mortars . 'I think what we're seeing here is mission creep,' Robert Baer, a former CIA officer, told CNN. 'The Iraqi army is not up to the task. And without the United States Air Force and the military on the ground, a lot of these ... bases would be overrun.' No American troops were injured during the ISIS attack early Friday. 'They were immediately engaged by members of the Iraqi army, the 7th Infantry of the Iraqi Army, and all were killed,' said Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby of the ISIS militants. No U.S. military service members were under direct threat from the attack, as they were several miles away, but two Iraqi soldiers were killed and several were wounded. Iraqi forces have since re-secured the facility. But the fighting rages on in Al-Baghdadi, which was seized after ISIS militants attacked from three different directions. No evacuations from the base have been planned, but it is currently being hit with 'indirect fire' via rocket launchers and mortars, officials told CNN. Iraqi officials have since called for reinforcements, . It is currently where U.S. Marines are training members of the Iraqi 7th division and Iraqi pilots. Al-Baghdadi has been besieged for months by ISIS, which captured swathes of northern and western Iraq last year. Al-Baghdadi is only nine miles away from the air base, where Iraqi officials  have since called for reinforcements but no evacuations have been planned . No U.S. military serve members were under direct threat from the attack, as they were several miles away, but two Iraqi soldiers were killed and several were wounded . This prompted a campaign of U.S-led air strikes and the deployment of hundreds of U.S. military advisers to the country. On Wednesday President Obama formally requested from Congress the authority to use military force in the war against ISIS. The proposal does not ask for the deployment of ground troops. During a press conference the president said: 'Our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive and ISIL is going to lose.'

"It's always nice, and brave on their part, for hotel staff to tell guests on arrival that they will try and deal with any requests they may have. An extra towel, having an ironing board sent to your room, and replacement toilet rolls are easy enough to arrange. But how about getting a llama to run amok in the hotel or allowing 6ft long monitor lizard in the room? It seems there is nothing concierges at these hotels won't do to make a guest's stay perfect. But just what are the strangest requests they have ever received? Hotel concierges are usually only too keen to fulfil their guests' requests, but some travellers push it too far . A personal invite for a llama - Grand Del Mar, San Diego . A guest staying at the Grand Del Mar in San Diego, California, wanted to surprise a friend with news of a trip away. So to give a clue, he negotiated with hotel staff to bring a llama in to help give a clue as to where he was whisking his mate off to. It was of course Peru, and they happily went off some time later. The llama was of course taken home safely. One man keen to reveal a surprise destination in a clever way to a friend asked for, and got, a llama . Penguins waiting in the room - Four Seasons, Hawaii . Sitting alongside the llama for one of the wackiest requests comes courtesy of the fantasy island of Hawaii. A concierge at the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai has revealed that one guest asked for a group of penguins to be waiting for them in their room, with Morgan Freeman narrating the meeting. Sadly, the guest didn't get chance to p-p-p-pick up a penguin, and the request was dismissed. No shock that a request for penguins to be waiting in the Four Seasons Resort Hualalai was dismissed . Room full of Nicholas Cages - Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk, Texas . Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz decided to have some fun when she checked into the Hotel Indigo San Antonio Riverwalk during a business trip. After receiving a welcome text that offered assistance 'any time,' Ms Grzywacz replied back saying she would like a signed picture of Nicholas Cage in Con Air on her bed. And the well-meaning staff adhered to her request, and the actors face was waiting on entry. The rest of the trip involved various other requests for Nicholas Cage in an array of films, all granted by the hotel. Sarah Kovacs Grzywacz was delighted when her jokey requests for images of Nicholas Cage were fulfilled . The dedicated staff delivered the requested images, and even apologised when one didn't come in time . Three M&Ms and a bacon portrait - Woodlands Resort, Houston . Bacon is a beautiful thing to many people, so much so a guest asked for a picture of it in his room along with three red M&Ms . Dustin Wray and girlfriend Lauren Taylor decided to spent the night at the Woodlands Resort in Houston after purchasing tickets to see their favorite singer John Mayer perform there. When Dustin had completed the online booking for the hotel room a month earlier he couldn’t resist having some fun when it came to the ‘special requests’ section. Dustin requested: ‘Three red M&Ms on the counter. Not packages, just three single M&Ms. One for me, one for my girlfriend, and one to split if we get hungry late at night. And a picture of bacon set on the bed. I love pictures of bacon.’ And sure enough, on checking into their room they were met by the M&Ms, which they shared, and the delicious photo of bacon. Lovely stuff. A large rubber duck in the bathroom? - Premier Inn, Godstone . It's always nice to have some element of home comforts when your staying in a hotel. And one guest made sure he wasn't going to miss out during his stay at the Premier Inn in Goldstone, Surrey, when he requested a large rubber duck for the bathroom. Other requests received by staff for the brand with the Lenny Henry commercials include a team member loaning a guest their trousers for an important last minute meeting in Liverpool, helping a guest buy a new bridesmaid's dress as the original had ripped on a wedding day in Ross on Wye and helping a guest propose to their bride to be because they were too nervous in Bournemouth. Can I bring my 6ft-long lizard? - Travelodge, Lowestoft . Can you tell me how many stars are in the sky tonight? Can you call Windsor Castle and find out if the Queen is in? Can you store my lobster in your freezer? These are just some of the peculiar requests Travelodge staff have been asked by customers. One such customer who was staying at Docklands Travelodge asked the hotel team if he could practice his board presentation in Mandarin to the hotel team prior to a meeting. A 6ft-long monitor lizard wasn't included in the Lowestoft Travelodge's list of permitted pets . Another, staying at Edinburgh Central Travelodge, asked the hotel manager if he could borrow his suit for the morning as he had a job interview and he forgot his suit at home. Meanwhile, the hotel receptionist at Luton Travelodge received a call from a PA to see if her boss could be dropped off by helicopter in the hotel car-park. And the best of all was a man who was unsure if the pet policy covered his far-from-domestic animal at the Lowestoft Travelodge - a 6ft monitor lizard. Help to buy two camels? - Loews Ventana Canyon Resort, Arizona . A guests asked the staff at the Loews Ventana Canyon Resort in Tucson, Arizona if they could assist him buy two camels. The concierge, who was on her first month in the job, kept her cool, and a straight face, located a nearby dealer, and the guest's wish was fulfilled. Well nearly... after giving the camels a 'once over,' the camel had one too few humps for the guest's liking and he pulled out of the deal. He clearly should have specified he wanted a bactrian breed of camel so he didn't get a dromedary. Although a concierge found a camel dealer in Arizona, the guest wanted them to have two humps not one . Wild goat's milk from Wales... for a bath - Savoy Hotel, London . The Savoy's head butler Sean Davoren has had some wacky requests in his days service elite guests, with wild goat's milk for a guest's bath among the more unusual. But it was certainly achievable, at a cost. The milk itself cost a manageable £50, but the taxi fare to Wales and back to get it ran up £600 on the meter. The milk was then warmed up, and 30 bottles of heated Evian was used to rinse the white stuff off the picky client afterwards. A unicorn greeting - Hotel Indigo in Asheville, North Carolina . For all of a hotel employee's good intentions, mythical animals are a request too far. But the concierge at the Hotel Indigo in Asheville, North Carolina, thought outside the box, and purchased a cuddly unicorn toy instead. Citing that the unicorn had 'migrated' for the season, the toy was left with an apology of not being able to purchase the real thing.","Unicorns, goat's milk and bacon feature in world's wackiest hotel requests .
Portraits of Nicholas Cage were granted by one helpful staff member .

"A retired senior police officer is preparing to sue over a £750,000 legacy left by his wealthy uncle to a carer. Former Scotland Yard superintendent John Armstrong plans to challenge the sum left by his 78-year-old relative to Linda Lawrence, 50. The mother-of-two, who drives a Mercedes, was left the bulk of Philip Jones' £1.2million fortune after he changed his will in her favour a year before he died. Former Scotland Yard superintendent John Armstrong plans to challenge his uncle Philip Jones' (left) decision to change his will and leave the bulk of his fortune to carer to Linda Lawrence, 50 (right) As a well as a sum of £110,000, Mrs Lawrence received two flats and their contents, including jewellery, and the pensioner's stocks, shares and money in his bank accounts. His family estimate she inherited up to £750,000 before tax. Mr Jones had been a successful lawyer before retiring in the late 1990s to care for his wife Mary, who had Parkinson's disease. As her health deteriorated, the childless couple were forced to hire carers. According to Mr Jones's family, Mrs Lawrence was one of these workers, hired on a cash-in-hand basis. Mr Armstrong, 52, from Hertfordshire, who was left £20,000, said: 'My uncle continued to use Linda's services after my auntie Mary's death, describing her to family members as 'the daughter he never had' and someone who he had very strong feelings for. 'But we became more concerned when he confided that he had given her an 'escape fund' in the hope they could start a new life together. 'He said he had paid for her and her family to go on holiday to Disneyland in Florida.' The nephew said any attempts to question Mrs Lawrence's motives were met with 'contempt and anger'. His brother Chris, 55, a retired businessman, said he had visited his uncle every day in the 18 months leading up to his death. The £1million Georgian farmhouse outside the Essex village of Little Clacton that pensioner Philip Jones shared with his wife before moving to a seafront retirement flat in nearby Frinton On Sea.  He later bequeathed more than £700,000 to Linda Lawrence, his carer for several years before his death in August 2013 . He said Mr Jones was 'besotted' with Mrs Lawrence, adding: 'He started talking about helping her pay off her mortgage. He had basically fallen head over heels in love with this woman. He wouldn't have a word said against her. 'He was totally convinced she was going to leave her husband and set up home with him, which is laughable … he was in a wheelchair and needed dialysis three times a week.' The older nephew said Mr Jones's 'sudden' change to his will was 'very sad', adding: 'It is wrong. You shouldn't be able to do this in a position of trust. I think morally it is shocking and there should be some kind of legislation to stop this sort of thing happening.' Mr Jones's will was altered in May 2012, just over a year before he died in August 2013. His two flats, in Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, were sold in autumn last year for £250,000 and £260,000 respectively, according to the Land Registry. Before moving to a retirement flat in 1997, Mr Jones had lived in a five-bedroom 15th-century farmhouse near Clacton-on-Sea, which was on the market last year for £945,000. Mrs Lawrence lives in a three-bedroom detached home worth £320,000 near Frinton-on-Sea with her husband Gary, 52. When contacted by the Daily Mail, Mrs Lawrence said she would 'completely disagree' with any suggestion of impropriety but would not comment further.","Former Scotland Yard Supt John Armstrong plans to challenge the will .

"A bullying undertaker sacked an older female employee and told staff he would replace her with a 'fit young blonde', a tribunal heard. Jon Christophers, who runs family firm F Christophers and Son Ltd in Devon, said he would get rid of 64-year-old grandmother Rozamund Perrin 'because he wanted someone younger'. The tribunal in Exeter heard that the 6ft 4in boss was an 'intimidating bully' who also 'missed deadlines' - a serious error for a funeral director. Rozamund Perrin, left, was sacked from her job of four years at funeral directors after her boss Jon Christophers said to colleague Kate Parsons, right, that he would replace her with a 'young, fit blonde' Miss Perrin, known as Roz, took her claim for unfair dismissal, sex and age discrimination to tribunal after she was sacked from her job of four years. Her colleague Kate Parsons, a funeral director who worked at the firm, gave evidence and said: 'Jon's attitude in the office was that he was above all of us – no please or thank you. 'It was his way or no way. He would belittle Roz in front of clients, make promises he couldn't keep, miss deadlines and leave Roz to make the apologies and deal with the wrath of clients. He would make errors and try and blame Roz.' Mrs Parsons said Mr Christophers said to her: 'Don't worry, I'll get rid of her [Miss Perrin] and replace her with a young fit blonde,' and did go on to find a younger replacement. The undertaker said Miss Perrin, of Stokeinteignhead, Devon, carried out many duties within the family run firm and helped Mrs Parsons dress the deceased. She said: 'I can recall when we had to dress a very large gentleman and I asked Roz whether she would help out. 'Roz was willing to do so and was excellent. After we had dressed the deceased, Jon came in before we could move the deceased to the coffin. Jon Christophers, right, with his father Fred, left, the director of family-run F Christophers and Son Ltd . 'I remember clearly Jon saying sarcastically ""oh look, the two women have tried but couldn't manage it"".' She said Mr Christophers also mocked Miss Perrin's typing even though she suffered with arthritis. Miss Perrin said he was an 'intimidating bully' who fell out with Mrs Parsons. She said: 'I think Jon was threatened by Kate because she was an experienced funeral director. Jon used to make mistakes with funeral arranging and Kate would sort them out. 'Jon was very rude to Kate and often swore at her.' Miss Perrin also said there was an issue with Mr Christophers' toilet habit of not cleaning the office loo after he used it. There was only the one toilet for clients and staff alike and she said Mr Christophers would 'use the toilet but leave it in a very unpleasant state'. She said: 'When I raised the issue with him, he said ""that's your job"". She added: 'He dismissed me because he wanted someone younger. He was looking for a fit young blonde.' The tribunal panel was told that Mr Christophers was also overheard making a phone call when he said his female staff ‘don’t submit to me – that’s the problem – all women should submit to me.’ F Christophers and Son Ltd are a small family run funeral directors with branches at Ashburton and Newton Abbot in Devon and have been going since 1846. They say 'we are proud to be independent and will continue to do so with the next generation of the family'. F Christophers and Son Ltd (pictured) are a small family run funeral directors with branches at Ashburton and Newton Abbot in Devon and have been going since 1846 . The firm is run by senior director Fred Christophers, 74, and his son Jon is a fellow partner. Tribunal judge Colm O'Rourke ruled that she was unfairly dismissed and discriminated against and said it was 'a humiliating and degrading environment based on her gender'. He said the panel agreed that Mr Christophers had a 'general discriminatory attitude to age' and concluded she suffered discrimination and harassment due to her sex and age. Miss Perrin is seeking £45,000 damages from the firm and a remedy hearing will decide on the final settlement.","Jon Christophers said he would get rid of grandmother Rozamund Perrin .

"Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she wasn't '100 percent sober' when she nodded off during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address last month. The 81-year-old Supreme Court Justice blamed her colleague Anthony Kennedy for poorly timed catnap, telling attendees of a Smithsonian Associates event in Washington, D.C. that he brought a 'very fine California wine' to dinner that was too good not to indulge in. Scroll down for video . Blame it on the alcohol: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, center, says she wasn't '100 percent sober' when she nodded off during the president's State of the Union address last month. Ginsburg says that former Justice David Souter used to keep her awake, but now she's sandwiched between Anthony Kennedy, her left, and Stephen Breyer, her right, and 'they’re sort of timid about it' Snooze fest: President Barack Obama hugs Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Capitol's House chamber before he delivered his 2015 State of the Union address - which she slept through. Ginsburg also fell asleep during Obama's 2013 speech to a joint session of Congress . 'The audience – for the most part – is awake because they’re bobbing up and down all the time and we sit there stone-faced, sober judges,' Ginsburg said at the Georgetown University event on Thursday evening, according to CBS. 'At least I wasn’t 100 percent sober because before we went to the State of the Union we had dinner,' she said. Ginsburg also fell asleep during Obama's 2013 address to a joint session of Congress. Her excuse then? A 'very good California wine' that Justice Kennedy brought to dinner. Kennedy's wine apparently got the best of her this year, too, and she again dozed off during the president's televised speech. 'Justice Kennedy brought in … it was an Opus something or other, very fine California wine that Justice Kennedy brought and I vowed this year just sparkling water, stay away from the wine,' Ginsburg revealed on Thursday. 'But in the end, the dinner was so delicious, it needed wine to accompany it,' she said. After the president's address was over, Ginsburg said one of her granddaughters called her up to let her know that she'd again been caught napping on camera. 'She said, ""Bubbe, you were sleeping at the State of the Union,"" ' Ginsburg recalled. Justice Antonin Scalia, who was also at last night's event, teasingly told Ginsburg, 'Well, that’s the first intelligent thing you’ve done.' Ginsburg said that former Justice David Souter used to help keep her awake during the president's lengthy remarks. 'When he was on the court, he was on one side and he had an acute sense of when I was about to [nod off],' Ginsburg said, per The Blaze. 'Now I have Justice Kennedy on one side, Justice Breyer, and they’re sort of timid about it.'","The 81-year-old Supreme Court Justice blamed her colleague Anthony Kennedy for poorly timed catnap .

"A celebrity finance guru and multi-millionaire was caught by police in a sex act while driving his £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. Greg Secker, 39, boss of 'Learn to trade', still had his trousers undone when officers pulled over his black 6.5 litre sports car. Secker, described on his website as a 'master trader, entrepreneur, philanthropist and international speaker', pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention in West Hill, Wandsworth, on March 20 last year. Multi-millionaire Greg Secker (pictured) was caught by police in a sex act while driving his Lamborghini . Greg Secker set up 'Learn to Trade' eight years ago. Since then it has educated more than 200,000 on how to build their wealth either through earning a second income from trading or learning how to be a full-time trader. As boss of the company, Secker was a prized finalist position in the 2010 London Excellence Awards, and claimed 49th place in the 2010 Sunday Times Fast Track 100 Awards. There are a number of free workshops offered, but the 'master' programme costs £13,000. A charge of drink driving was dropped when the Crown Prosecution Service failed to submit evidence to support their case Secker's urine alcohol level was 148 milligrams - the legal limit is 107. Prosecutor Nicholas Earl-Quarcoo told Wimbledon Magistrates' Court police decided to tail and stop Secker at 7.55pm. He said: 'The Lamborghini drifted into their lane, which led the officer to take evasive action to avoid a collision with the car. 'They put on their flashing lights and tried to catch up with the Lamborghini, which turned off the A3 and passed through two no entry signs. 'When officers caught up with the car it was parked in a bay with the engine still running and they could see a female in the passenger seat. 'They spoke to Mr Secker and he then pulled up his trousers that were loose and undone and the officer asked: ""What happened there?"" 'Mr Secker replied: ""I know, I'm sorry. I was getting a b******.'"" His lawyer told the court that Secker, a father-of-three from Oxshott, Leatherhead, accepts his behaviour was 'extremely foolish.' District Judge James Henderson fined Secker £1,000, with £85 costs, ordered him to pay a £100 victim surcharge and endorsed his driving licence with five penalty points.

He was a multi-millionaire by his twenties having set up one of the UK's fastest growing companies, educating people how on to be a successful trader.

"Phillip Schofield was forced to apologise last night after ambushing David Cameron on live television with a list of alleged Tory paedophiles compiled from a cursory search on the internet. Schofield admitted he had put it together after spending three minutes collecting unsubstantiated gossip online – and that a 'misjudged camera angle' meant some of the names could have been seen by viewers. Presented with the list, the Prime Minister responded by warning of a 'witch-hunt' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay. Scroll down for video . Springing a surprise: Phillip Schofield, seated next to This Morning co-presenter Holly Willoughby, picks up the list of alleged Tory paedophiles  before handing it back to Mr Cameron . This was the extraordinary moment Philip Scholfield, who has now apologised for the stunt, handed the list of names to David Cameron . Downing Street later attacked it as a 'silly stunt' and 'trial by Twitter', while MPs warned it could distract from serious allegations of abuse of children being investigated by a string of official inquiries. There are growing cross-party calls for a single, overarching investigation now that the number of separate probes into allegations of paedophilia at the BBC, care homes and in Whitehall has reached double figures. During what was supposed to be an interview on This Morning about dementia, Schofield declared there could have been 'a cover-up, a paedophile ring amongst the elite of great Britain that led all the way to Downing Street' and handed a card with names on it to the Prime Minister. 'You know the names on that piece of paper. Will you be speaking to those people?' Schofield asked. The presenter admitted: 'It took me about three minutes last night to continually find a list of the same names.' The Prime Minister takes the card and responds with firm words warning of a 'witch hunt' that meant prominent people were being wrongly accused of child abuse simply because they were gay . The Prime Minister was visibly taken aback by the stunt and some viewers said names were clearly visible on the piece of paper handed to the Prime Minister . The Prime Minister did not look at the card on air, instead placing it on the table in front of him, but Number Ten sources confirmed later it had included half a dozen names of senior Conservatives who had been members of or associated with the governments of the 1980s. A composed Mr Cameron said he did not like what Schofield was doing, saying: 'Look Phillip, I think this is really important. There is a danger if we are not careful, that this can turn into a sort of witch-hunt, particularly against people who are gay. 'I'm worried about the sort of thing you are doing right now... giving me a list of names you have taken off the internet. Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to Ofcom last night asking the media watchdog to investigate whether This Morning broke TV fairness rules . 'Anyone who has any information about . anyone who is a paedophile, no matter how high up in British society . they are, that is what the police are for.' It . is understood that the passing of the list to Cameron was the . production team's idea, although it is believed Schofield may have had . some input into it. It is unclear if the programme took any legal advice . before doing it. Schofield later apologised, saying: 'If any viewer was able to identify anyone listed, I would like to apologise and stress that was never my intention. Mr Cameron had agreed to appear on This Morning to talk about dementia, including an event held at Downing Street where he discuss the issue with TV presenter Fiona Phillips . 'I was not accusing anyone of . anything and it is essential that it is understood that I would never be . part of any kind of witch-hunt. 'Unfortunately there may have been a . misjudged camera angle for a split second as I showed the Prime Minister . some information I had obtained from the internet. 'I asked for his reaction to give him . the opportunity to make a point which he very clearly made about the . dangers of any witch-hunt.' Schofield's on-air ambush prompted . immediate  condemnation. BBC veteran Jonathan Dimbleby wrote on Twitter: . 'How cretinous can you get – giving a list of online names to PM as . though they were evidence. Makes a mockery of our trade.' Tory MP Rob Wilson last night reported This Morning to broadcasting regulator Ofcom, claiming the programme had broken rules on fairness. He said: 'Some of us have been painstakingly trying to get to the bottom of these allegations about Jimmy Savile and others for months in a responsible and diligent way. 'It is very unhelpful for celebrities to ambush the Prime Minister and reveal information that is not in the public domain for very good reason. After the TV showdown, Mr Cameron returned to Downing Street where he took a call from US President Barack Obama. He congratulated him on his his re-election . Steve Messham met with Welsh Secretary David Jones this week to discuss his claim he was abused by a senior Conservative while at the Bryn Estyn home in North Wales . William Hague, who as Welsh Secretary set up the Waterhouse Inquiry into abuse at care homes in North Wales, said 'no stone would be left unturned' by a series of new government reviews . 'If Phillip Schofield feels his information is watertight, he should take it to the police without delay.' Former Conservative whip Michael Fabricant said Schofield had been 'very foolish and irresponsible'. He added: 'I loathe witch-hunts. In this country, you are innocent until proven guilty.' Tory MP Stuart Andrew, who was a councillor in Wrexham at the time of the original inquiry into the North Wales abuse scandal, described Schofield's tactic as 'completely irresponsible.' An ITV spokesman: 'It is extremely regrettable that names may have been very briefly visible as a result of a misjudged camera angle, although most viewers would not have been able to read the list.' An aide to the Prime Minister said: 'This silly stunt has resulted in people's names being put out there. 'They will want to vigorously defend themselves.' The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'We shouldn't have people just throwing names and accusations around and trial by Twitter.'

"Richey Kiffe, 52, who is accused of strangling four of his ex-girlfriend's Chihuahua puppies and beheading one of them . A man has been accused of strangling four of his ex-girlfriend's Chihuahua puppies before beheading her favourite pet and leaving it on the doorstep in a drunken attack. Richey Kiffe, 52, from Louisiana allegedly killed the pets and stuffed their corpses into a bag before hiding them behind the sofa. He also left the body and head of the beheaded dog on the door step of his home in Houma so it would greet his former partner Suzanna Guthrie, when she went to his house. Kiffe has now been charged with four counts of aggravated cruelty to animals . Police were called to the property on Tuesday and is being held in the Terrebonne Parish jail on a $50,000 bond. Police officers were called to Kiffe's house on Tuesday evening after Ms Guthrie found the bodies of her pets. According to Houma Today, she had asked him to care for her two dogs and the puppies after breaking up with him two weeks ago. He then asked her to go to his house to pick up the dogs after talking over how they were going to split their possessions. She told the newspaper: 'He asked me ""What do you want me to do with your stuff?"" I told him: 'My name is on that lease; I'm not going nowhere, but could you pick up my dogs please?"" 'And the next thing that comes out of his mouth is: ""I can't be responsible for what happens next.""' 'The one that I found was the one I had named, the one he knew I wanted.'

"Google has revealed the full extent of its 'right to be forgotten' operation, disclosing that it has removed over 260,000 links from search results. The European Court of Justice ruled in May that Google must remove links to websites that include content that is 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant'. However, the ruling has been criticised by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, who said that criminals were using it to hide their murky pasts. The search giant admitted this week that so far there had been 216,810 requests for web links to be removed. This resulted in 783,510 links being reviewed and 262,280 hidden from internet users. Ruling: The ECJ’s 'right to be forgotten' ruling allows European citizens to request that links to 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' information be removed from Google search results . Notice: MailOnline has received a number of notifications requesting removal of links. The  request includes a note to say 'in many cases, the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned' So far Google's service is restricted to its European versions, although EU data protection watchdogs want to make it global as the deleted results could be seen if a user was to switch to the .com search engine. Examples of links deleted by Google include a number of MailOnline articles detailing issues ranging from drug abuse to incest, murder and spying. For instance, MailOnline received a request to remove a May 2009 article describing the sordid captivity in which Josef Fritzl kept his family. The piece was based on extracts from the book ‘The Crimes of Josef Fritzl: Uncovering the Truth’. Publisher Harper Collins told MailOnline at the time it did not know who sent the request . Other MailOnline stories removed from Google results include claims from April 2013 that a ten-year-old girl could have died if her parents had relied on the NHS 111 helpline. More recently, Google removed a MailOnline story about a teenager, Kyle Ivison, slapped with an Asbo for committing 40 per cent of the offences in his town. The European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

In November, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid warned that terrorists were trying to use the ruling to wipe stories about their trials from Google, condemning 'Luxembourg's unelected judges' for forcing search engines to remove links to news stories. In his speech to newspaper editors, Mr Javid said: ‘Since Luxembourg’s unelected judges created the so-called “right to be forgotten”, Google has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds,’ he told the Society of Editors conference in Southampton. ‘Each day, a thousand requests pour in from people who, for one reason or another, would prefer their pasts to be kept secret. ‘Criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other, similar crimes. ‘Terrorists have ordered Google to cover up stories about their trials.’ Mr Javid added: ‘The “right to be forgotten” is censorship by the back door. Stories are not being deleted from archives because of the ruling, but if they cannot be found by the search engines they may as well not be there at all.’ The European Court of Justice ruled people had a right to ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches. The decision – which cannot be appealed against and is binding for all EU states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information. But once search engines like Google drop links to such material, it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet. Facebook was the site which had the most links removed, followed by the social network search site Profile Engine and video sharing site YouTube. Last year, the foundation which operates Wikipedia described the rule as 'unforgivable censorship'. Speaking at the announcement of the Wikimedia Foundation's first-ever transparency report in London, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said the public had the 'right to remember'. ‘We are on a path to secret, online sanitation of truthful information,’ said Geoff Brigham, general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation. ‘No matter how well it may be intended, it is compromising human rights, the freedom of expression and access to information, and we cannot forget that. ‘So we have to expose it and we have to reject this kind of censorship.’ Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which has led to the search engine being bombarded with requests. More than 200,000 removal requests involving more than 700,000 URLs have been made to Google worldwide.

"He might be playing the most fantasised-about romantic hero created in recent years but there's plenty more to British star Jamie Dornan than whips and chains. The 32-year-old former model plays the BDSM-loving billionaire with a high-flying business and penchant for canes and floggers in the much talked-about film version of Fifty Shades of Grey. His character seduces literature student Anastasia Steele in the steamy story - but Dornan, who hails from County Down in Northern Ireland, has been getting women hot under the collar since his days as a a Calvin Klein model. Scroll down for video . Jamie Dornan started his career as a model, making his name posing in tight, white pants while smouldering moodily for Calvin Klein . The husband and father-of-one showing off demonstrated how good a bit of facial scruff can look - teamed with a bare chest and black pants . Nevertheless, his sexy role in Fifty Shades of Grey is set to catapult the model, actor and musician to dizzying heights of fame, but he's equally fond of gritty TV dramas. He has been putting in a wonderfully creepy performance in BBC2 thriller The Fall since 2013, as gimlet-eyed serial killer Paul Spector alongside Gillian Anderson. Along with his turn in The Fall and the film version of EL James' popular book, Dornan has been hitting TV screens in Channel 4's lush period drama, New Worlds. Next, comes the role of Dr. Allan Pascal in an upcoming film The 9th Life of Louis Drax, a supernatural thriller which is based on a book of the same name. Despite his acting success, Dornan's main focus is on his biggest role of all - that of father to his 15-month old daughter Dulcie with his actress turned singer wife Amelia Warner, also 32, whom he married in 2013. Now the actor has made his breakthrough in his first major part as BDSM-loving billionaire Christian Grey, here clad in a well-cut navy suit . Jamie and his Fifty Shades co-star Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, shared a number of sex scenes filmed on a close set . Fifty Shades director Sam Taylor-Johnson created an intimate environment for Jamie and Dakota to film the highly-anticipated sex scenes . As Christian Grey, Jamie dons a tailored grey suit,  worn with a grey silk tie, now iconic for adorning the cover of EL James's erotic novel . In the years before Warner came onto the scene, the hunk spent much of his time splashed across billboards modelling for Calvin Klein alongside both Kate Moss and Eva Mendes, and starred in campaigns for Dior, Aquascutum and Armani among others. He also spent a few years in an off-on relationship with Keira Knightley from 2003. The stunning couple were often pictured together at A-list parties and relaxing off duty. When not squiring Knightly, Dornan attempted to forge a musical career, performing in the folk band Sons of Jim, until 2008, which supported Scottish singer-songwriter KT Tunstall on tour. Since acting success struck, his look has changed from baggy jeans and spiked hair to sophisticated gent, although he has always been incredibly handsome and able to pull off any style. As a result, in 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed British men. In recent years Dornan has rarely seen without a beard, which adds to his manly, grown-up appeal. Speaking about his facial fuzz, he said: 'I feel uncomfortable without it. I find myself moving differently. I don’t like myself without a beard.' Jamie (left) shows how to combine a bushy hipster beard with immaculate black tie at the film's global premiere at Zoo Palast in Berlin on February 11; in the film, he flashed his impressive gym-toned abs as Christian  but many female fans lamented his chest's lack of hair .

"She's long been a fan of all things equestrian and today, the Duchess of Cornwall turned out for her first day at the races this year. Resplendent in a tweed coat dress, Camilla, 67, completed her cosy ensemble with a large furry hat and a pair of on-trend over-the-knee boots. The Duchess was at Sandown Park in Esher, Surrey for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup, an event that celebrates the bravery and dedication of the British Armed Forces with a day of horse racing. The Duchess appeared to enjoy the show and cheered as her favourite crossed the line . Nervous Camilla did appear to be feeling the pressure at one point, while caught up in watching the race . It is one of only two military race meetings in the UK and has been on the racing calendar for more than 150 years. In front of a grandstand crammed with soldiers, Camilla was introduced to Royal Artillery officers before joining them in the Parade Ring to watch the runners be led past. Back in the Royal Box, she and the soldiers were treated to a parade of fox hounds from the Royal Artillery Hunt ahead of the opening race, the Jockeys' Handicap Hurdle which was won by Right Step. Later, the Duchess presented the Royal Artillery Gold Cup to jockey Jody Sole in the Winner's Enclosure before being introduced to a group of retired Royal Artillery officers. Not even the pouring rain could dampen Camilla's spirits as she kept the drops at bay with an umbrella . The Duchess was at the races to present the Royal Artillery Cup which was won by jockey Jody Sole . Camilla has long been a racing aficionado and is a regular sight at race meetings during the summer . The first Royal Artillery Gold Cup event was held in 1862 in Eltham, before moving to Sandown Park in 1878. A horse owned by the Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, called Norman Conqueror won the race there in 1996. The race is restricted to horses that are owned or have been leased by those who are serving, or have served, in the Royal Artillery. The jockeys must be amateurs and they must also be past or present members of any of the Armed Services. Camilla looked wonderful in her tweed coat dress, accessorised with a cream scarf and dazzling brooch . Stylish Camilla, 67, looked on-trend in a soft beige furry hat, taupe coat dress and trendy over-the-knee boots . Camilla arrives at the event, which is one of only two military race meetings in the UK . The Duchess was due to present the Royal Artillery Gold Cup in the Winner's Enclosure . In recent years the meeting has established an important charitable theme, with sponsors and race-goers generously supporting Help for Heroes and Royal Artillery charities. The trip to the races comes at the end of a busy week for Camilla, who yesterday stopped to pose for a selfie with a 13-year-old boy during a tour of an arthritis centre in London. Danny Roberts, from Maida Vale, is currently being treated for the illness but was delighted when he received a bedside visit from Camilla. Speaking afterwards, the teenager said the Duchess had been 'really concerned' and added that it was 'very nice of her' to come and visit. During the visit, the Duchess was shown immune cells in a microscope, which were there as part of a project working out how puberty and stress can affect the immune system. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, looked chic as she arrived for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup at Sandown Park . Kind-hearted Camilla poses for a photo with 13-year-old arthritis sufferer Danny Roberts from Maida Vale . The Duchess of Cornwall also visited  a school and met pupils taking part in a creative writing workshop . The Duchess was on elegant form in a tailored black jacket and a flared grey skirt during her visit . The visit came on the same day as a trip to a school, where Camilla told a class of children that they were being 'very brave' as they read a scene from Shakespeare's As You Like It in front of her. The Duchess, who was on elegant form in a tailored black jacket and a flared grey skirt, was visiting Holland Park School in West London to present a creative writing prize to one of the children. Mukahang Limbu, who received a certificate from the Duchess, had taken part in a competition run by charity First Story, of which Camilla is patron. The charity aims to inspire more children to write by sending authors into schools, among them Scottish writer Kate Clanchy, who was at the school when the Duchess arrived. Touring the school, Camilla was shown into several classes, including Latin, History, English and one of the science labs.","Camilla was at the races for the Royal Artillery Gold Cup at Sandown .

"Home to roost: Andrew Biddle, 45, has returned to New Jersey after months on the run . A boat racing champion who allegedly faked his own death at sea to avoid facing up to a string of fraud allegations has returned and surrendered to police. Andrew Biddle, 45, went sailing with a friend in July off the coast of New Jersey - but their pontoon motorboat crashed at 11:30pm in what seemed like an accident. Despite an 18-hour search by coast guards, there was no sign of Biddle - and a few weeks later police claimed the accident was cover so he could flee criminal prosecution for alleged fraud connected to his boating business. However, after almost seven months on the run, Biddle has returned to Egg Harbor township, New Jersey, and has faced a court in a bail hearing, according to the Press of Atlantic City. Biddle, who has won powerboat racing events in the U.S. and also in Britain, began the legal process Thursday, appearing at a bail hearing in Atlantic County Superior Court. According to the paper, Biddle has until tonight to post a $50,000 bail or be taken to jail before facing the fraud accusations. According to local law enforcement, Biddle committed a string of unscrupulous transactions as the manager of Professional Boat Sales, in Egg Habor, New Jersey. Boating pro: The champion racer will now face fraud charges for allegedly lying to and cheating customers as the manager of a boating store in Egg Habor, New Jersey . Responsibility? Biddle's attorney said that a sense of responsibility towards his wife, left, helped drive him back . The allegations include selling a boat without paying its owner back, lying about the cost of items, and taking downpayments on a boat without ever providing it. After the initial coast guard search, which spanned a 60-mile length of sea, authorities became suspicious of the boat crash. Police in the township soon declared themselves 'skeptical' of the notion the crash was accidental - and some observed how unlikely the accident would have been for a seasoned sailor who knew the waters well. Biddle's attorney seemed to imply he had been living as a fugitive at sea. Mark Roddy said: 'I know him well enough to know his knowledge of the oceans is phenomenal. This is a guy who, had he wanted to stay out there forever, he could have.' Search: The boating 'accident' in July prompted the coat guard to spend 18 hours combing 60 miles of water in the hope of finding Biddle . However, he would not discuss in detail where he had been. According to Roddy, he was called out of the blue by Biddle, who said he wanted to 'step up to the plate' and faces the charges. The lawyer added that his sudden return was promptly partly out of concern for his wife and children. It is not clear whether his time on the run will result in any additional charges.","Andrew Biddle, 45, vanished after boating crash in July last year .

Freak accident: Andy Somerville from Texas discovered that a red-tailed hawk had got lodged in his bumper - Miraculously, the animal was still alive . Help! A bird of prey went on the flight of his life after getting trapped in the grille of a pick up truck and traveling at speeds of up to 70mph . Somerville immediately called the Wildlife Center of Texas who came out to rescue the animal. Photographs of the trapped hawk show it hanging out of the grill by its wings. Somerville said the bird's body was the engine compartment and he was just 'freaking out' when he found it. 'I started to reach in and he latched on to my finger pretty good,' the driver told KHOU News. 'That's when I realized it was alive.' He said he could imagine anything surviving the collision as he was doing  about 70mph at the time. Rescue mission: Photographs of the trapped hawk show it hanging out of the grill by its wings .

"Boris Johnson today waded into the Westminster tax avoidance row – after insisting people had the 'right to minimise' how much they pay. The London Mayor said everyone should pay their 'fair whack' but defended people's right to limit their 'obligations'. His intervention came after Ed Miliband became embroiled in a furious row with the Tory Party after accusing David Cameron of not caring about tax avoidance because he was 'up to his neck' in it. London Mayor Boris Johnson said everyone should pay their 'fair whack' but defended people's right to limit their 'obligations' The Labour leader accused Mr Cameron of being a 'dodgy Prime Minister, surrounded by dodgy donors'. Mr Miliband pointed the finger at Tory peer Lord Fink – accusing him of being involved in 'tax avoidance activities'. In response, Lord Fink threatened to sue Mr Miliband for libel if he repeated the slur. But less than 24 hours later, the former Tory treasurer admitted engaging in 'vanilla' tax avoidance. He added: 'Tax avoidance, everyone does it.' Mr Miliband said Lord Fink's remarks were an 'extraordinary U-turn', adding: 'The thing he objected to was me saying he was engaging in tax-avoiding activities.' He denied ever calling Lord Fink 'dodgy' – but said there were several other 'questionable donors to the Tory Party'. The Labour Party has insisted that any suggestion Ed Miliband avoided tax was a 'straightforward lie' When questioned about the row today, the London Mayor Boris Johnson told the Evening Standard: 'I think people have a legitimate right to minimise their tax obligations if they can but they should pay their fair whack. I do think it's important to be transparent.' Nigel Farage added: 'What I would say is nobody willingly pays more tax than they have to and that is certainly true.' Asked if he had ever taken measures 'to avoid paying tax', he said: 'I have never avoided any tax. I don't think I've ever avoided any tax myself through any complicated measures or in. No I haven't. I haven't. I haven't.' Lord Stanley Fink has given £3million to the Tories and held a bank account in Switzerland . The row erupted when a list of political donors had bank accounts with HSBC's private Swiss banking arm was leaked. Mr Miliband jumped on the revelation that many high profile Tories were named on the list and yesterday attacked the culture of tax avoidance. His remarks sparked accusations of hypocrisy over his own family's tax arrangements. Mr Miliband defended his tax affairs yesterday after being accused of benefiting from a controversial tax-avoidance scheme. The Labour leader and his family used a 'deed of variation' to divide the ownership of the family home in North London after the Labour leader's father Ralph died in 1994. These legal documents – which change the terms of someone's will after they have died – are used almost exclusively to reduce death duty bills in a legal form of tax avoidance. Deeds of variation were described as 'tax abuse' by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor. At an event at his old school, Haverstock School in North London, Mr Miliband defended his own complex arrangements. Asked if he thought it was 'dodgy to use what's called in the trade a deed of variation, to leave your house to your children that avoids tax', the Labour leader said: 'The deed of variation issue is something directed at me personally, it's something that my mother did 20 years ago, that was a decision she made. 'Let me just say this: I paid tax as a result of that transaction, I've avoided no tax in that. No doubt the Conservative Party wants to smear mud today but frankly it's not going to work. The story has been written before and I have paid tax on that money.' Labour today insisted any claim he avoided tax was a 'straightforward lie'. HSBC's private Swiss bank faces a Bank of England investigation . The Bank of England could investigate allegations of tax avoidance at UK-based bank giant HSBC, deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe indicated today. Sir Jon said the Bank was 'not yet' at the stage of probing the bank's private Swiss arm, which is at the centre of claims that it helped customers dodge tax. But he admitted the allegations, which have sparked a storm in Westminster, could be 'of relevance' to the Bank's prudential regulation authority which is responsible for enforcing stability in the British financial system. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Jon said: 'I think the allegations around HSBC raise serious issues around HSBC's conduct. 'We'd expect the management, the leadership of a large group, to be able to ensure that there is a culture and the operations within that group to manage those sorts of risks. 'I wouldn't comment on the case because we are not at that stage yet, but this is certainly something that could be of relevance to us.' It came as the former director of public prosecutions, SIr Keir Starmer criticised Government guidance that British citizens with Swiss bank accounts were unlikely to be prosecuted for tax evasion if they co-operated with the authorities. Sir Keir, now a Labour Party parliamentary candidate, said the guidance issued in January 2013 following the signing of the UK-Swiss tax co-operation agreement, had come just as he was seeking to drive up prosecutions for tax evasion. The guidance states that provided an account holder makes either a one-off payment or a voluntary disclosure in relation to their relevant assets and fully co-operates with HMRC, 'that person is highly unlikely to be subject to a criminal investigation by HMRC for a tax-related offence for past liabilities'.","The London Mayor said everyone should pay their 'fair whack' in tax .

"Seventy years after the Allied forces firebombed Dresden, the country remembers the tens of thousands who were burned alive by holding a sombre church service and forming a silent human chain across the city. 10,000 people joined hands along the river Eibe and across bridges in the east-German city, which has seen Europe's biggest neo-Nazi marches on February 13 in recent years. Delegates from Coventry, Breslau, Ostrava and St Petersburg - cities that also suffered brutal air attacks in the Second World War - lit candles at the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady) in the presence of those who survived the deadly bombings.

Dresden has recently become the beacon for an anti-Islam movement where as many as 25,000 protesters have marched against what they perceive as the growing influence of the religion. But tonight, 'anti-fascists' gathered on the square outside the church carrying a green banner which read: 'Fight for a humane society. Take action against the Nazis.' Germany's president spoke at the church which was left in ruins for years to symbolise the destruction of the Second World War, before being rebuilt. Joachim Gauck said: 'Bombs and fire indiscriminately annihilated both guilty and innocent, party members and small children, war criminals and nuns, guards and forced labourers, combat soldiers and refugees who had left their homes to save their lives and believed themselves to be in a safe place.' British and US bombers killed up to 25,000 people in the bombing of Dresden between February 13 and February 15 in 1945, in a bid to crush German morale in the final months of the war. They dropped at least 3,900 tonnes of explosive and incendiary bombs - unleashing an inferno that melted people where they stood and reduced vast areas in the city to rubble. Remembrance: A church service was held at the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), which was left in ruins for years to symbolise the destruction that befell Dresden . Connected: The candles this young boy placed on the mantle were lit by delegates from other cities who suffered similar bombings . Tribute: After bells rang out from the church, German President Joachim Gauck said: 'Bombs and fire indiscriminately annihilated both guilty and innocent, party members and small children' Deceased: President Gauck also remembered the thousands of Jews who died during the war, saying: 'We know who started this murderous war... so we'll never forget the victims of German warfare' Sombre: The church service commemorated the 25,000 people killed in the Dresden bombings between February 13 and February 15 . Anniversary: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivering a speech during a memorial service at the Frauenkirche cathedral . Helga Skoczowsky, who was nine at the time, described how she took refuge in the cellar of their apartment building and heard the haunting sound of approaching planes - and the bombs that followed. Struggling to hold in her tears, she said: 'The noise was dreadful... the light went out... the chimney tops blew off. 'We were covered in black, we had no eyelashes left, our lips were all crusty from the soot and we were all dirty and in the dark.' When they emerged, there was nothing left of their fourth-floor apartment. 'Everything was glowing and burning. People were running and screaming,' she added.' The six million Jews who died in the Holocaust were remembered alongside the Germans killed during the raids.

Germany remembered the victims of Nazism and of German bombing according to President Gauck who said: 'We know who started this murderous war... so we'll never forget the victims of German warfare.' For several months the 'Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West' (PEGIDA) has held marches in Dresden. Mayor Helma Orosz believes those protests gave this anniversary added importance. She said: 'February 13, more than any other date in the history of our city, warns us that we must show solidarity with those who flee war, violence and terror around the world.'

"An aerial view of a Canadian health centre has revealed that the building is shaped exactly like a naked, spread-eagled man - complete with male genitals. Locals believe the Newmarket Health Centre in Ontario got its distinctive shape by accident, with a series of small extensions being added to the original design. Amusingly the building is believed to house a STD clinic, among other medical facilities, with visitors having to enter the building through the groin area before they can have their check-up. Strange: Aerial photographs of the Newmarket Health Centre show that is shaped exactly like a naked, spread-eagled man - complete with male genitals . Aerial photographs of the Newmarket Health Centre show four wings branching out from a central hub that look like arms and legs. While the arms simply look outstretched, the building's legs are far more detailed - even appearing to have kneecaps and feet. At the top of the building is a square block resembling a head and nestling in what would be the groin area is a red-covered extension that looks like male genitals. Neighbours believe the building got its unique shape by accident but don't mind because the town is the birthplace of two of the country's most famous comedians - Jim Carrey and John Candy.

Local resident Peter Kaufman said: 'It's not something you would notice at all, really and we don't seem to mind. 'Having part of it look like a man's penis is particularly amusing. I'm sure Jim Carrey and John Candy will find it funny,' he added. The Newmarket Health Centre is a medical facility in the heart of Ontario's Newmarket neighbourhood. The walk-in clinic specialises in laboratory services, travel counseling, cardiac services, an onsite pharmacy and complete rehabilitation services.","Newmarket Health Centre in Ontario resembles a naked man from the air .

"The 14-year-old special needs student was allegedly raped after a teacher convinced her to act as bait in a bid to catch a school's sexual predator while have her case heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The girl said of the plan; 'I just felt like I was set up by the teachers. They gave me a word that they couldn't keep.' She has also revealed she after first refused to even partake in plan, but eventually gave in. A vice principal at Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, asked a girl to act as bait so they could catch a sexual predator in the act . The girl was said to have become involved in the plan after faculty members at Sparkman Middle School in Toney, Alabama, received complaints that a boy had been luring classmates into bathrooms and asking them for sex. Despite the constant allegations of sexual misconduct, he could not be punished because  he had not been 'caught in the act'. Therefore a teacher asked the young girl to meet him in the bathroom but would rush in before anything could happen, according to court documents. The plan took a horrifying turn when the suspect asked the girl to meet him in a different bathroom - meaning no one came in to save her. The girl had allegedly told the school's vice principal Jeanne Dunaway of the plan, but according to court documents, she didn't respond. 'We look forward to discussing this case with the Judges who will be deciding it and ultimately letting a jury decide this matter,' said Eric Artrip, the attorney representing the girl and her father, to CNN. 'It has essentially devastated her life.' In the aftermath of the alleged rape in January 2010, when a lawsuit was filed against the school, one vice principal claimed that the girl was responsible for herself when she went into the bathroom. Another, according to the documents, said that they 'weren't sure whether she consented' to the alleged assault. About a week before the suspected attack vice principals Dunaway and Teresa Terrell received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately and was assigned in-school suspension, according to federal attorneys. About a week before the alleged rape vice principals Jeanne Dunaway (left) and Teresa Terrell (right) received a complaint that the boy had touched a female student inappropriately. They both still work at the school . A few days later, June Simpson, a teacher's aide at the Huntsville-area school, told the principal, Ronnie Blair, that the boy had 'repeatedly tried to convince girls to have sex with him in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor'. She alleged that he even had sex with one student, according to the brief. On January 22, the suspected predator approached the victim and asked her for sex, an offer which she had repeatedly refused. When the girl told Simpson, she encouraged the girl to 'meet (the boy) in the bathroom where teachers could be positioned to 'catch him in the act' before anything happened,' according to the brief. The girl's attorney Eric Artrip said they had found 'substantial evidence' that his client had been forcibly raped . The girl initially refused, but then agreed, according to her attorney Eric Artrip. Simpson and the girl went to Dunaway's office to explain the plan, but Dunaway allegedly 'did not respond with any advice or directive'. The girl left Dunaway's office, found the boy in the hallway, and 'agreed to meet for sex,', the documents state. But instead of meeting in the boys' bathroom on the special needs students' corridor, the boy told the girl to meet him in the sixth-grade boys' bathroom, in another part of the school. This meant none of the staff could intervene and stop her from the alleged attack. The girl's attorney Eric Artrip told CNN: 'We found substantial evidence of a forceful rape, and that's what happened here. 'The idea she consented to this and somehow allowed it to happen is incredible.' In December a Federal Court threw out claims that the school district violated Title IX of federal law which dictates how schools must respond to allegations of sexual harassment. The Department of Justice and U.S. Department of Education filed an amicus brief Wednesday supporting her family's federal lawsuit against the Madison County School Board in Alabama. It states that using a child as 'rape bait' clearly violates Title IX'. It adds: 'School administrators knew the student's extensive history of sexual and violent misconduct and were alerted to the substantial risk he posed.' The school's faculty are appealing the state civil suits. One of the vice principals has now been promoted to a principal at a nearby elementary school. The teacher involved in setting up the plan has resigned.","A special needs student who was raped in Alabama after teachers used her as bait will have her case heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals .
