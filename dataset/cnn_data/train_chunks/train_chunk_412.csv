"Less than a year ago, Mark Driscoll, an evangelical pastor, was flying high. His hometown Seattle Seahawks were in the Super Bowl, and the brash pastor scored a big, faith-fueled interview with five of the team's top players, including quarterback Russell Wilson. But in a remarkably fast fall from grace, Driscoll resigned Tuesday as pastor of Mars Hill Church, a congregation he founded 18 years ago and turned into a force in the mostly secular Pacific Northwest. In a statement, Mars Hills' board of overseers said Driscoll hadn't committed any acts of ""immorality, illegality or heresy"" -- sins that have felled many a powerful pastor. Instead, the board said, Driscoll is guilty of ""arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner."" Driscoll was not asked to leave, the board added, saying they were ""surprised"" to receive his resignation letter. In that letter, obtained by Religion News Service, Driscoll says: ""Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for Mars Hill."" The 43-year-old pastor acknowledged that, ""There are many things I have confessed and repented of, privately and publicly, as you are well aware. Specifically, I have confessed to past pride, anger and a domineering spirit."" Before his resignation, a number of Mars Hills leaders fled the church, saying that Driscoll was not fit for leadership. He has also been accused of plagiarism and using a complex scheme to pad book sales. The pastor has apologized and said ""mistakes were made."" The broader beef with Driscoll, though, seemed to be his more-macho-than-thou approach to fellow Christians. According to Christianity Today, the pastor had trolled online discussion forums under the pseudonym ""William Wallace II,"" and lambasted the supposed rise of ""male lesbians;"" ""feman,"" (men who act like women, in his definition); and ""men who allow their wives to nag at them."" ""While the discussion board itself was a bad idea,"" Driscoll said in a letter obtained by Christianity Today, ""my decision to attack critics who were posting there (I did so by posting under the character 'William Wallace II') was an even worse idea."" Even before that revelation, Driscoll was highly controversial and almost comically outspoken. He once said that mainstream Christians had turned Jesus into a ""Richard Simmons, hippie, queer Christ,"" and a ""neutered and limp-wristed popular Sky Fairy of pop culture that ... would never talk about sin or send anyone to hell."" In a book he wrote with his wife in 2012, Driscoll delved into serious detail about his sex life, leaving some reviewers, and almost as many Christians, a bit uncomfortable. For all that, though -- or maybe, because of all that --  Driscoll was pretty successful by many measures. He built Mars Hill into a mini-empire, with 15 satellite locations and even a couple of universities. His books and sermons were read and heard by millions. In his resignation letter, Driscoll hints that his pastoral career isn't dead yet. ""My journey, at age 43, is far from over,"" he writes, ""I believe (God) has brought me a long way from some days I am not very proud of, and is making me more like him every day.""","Evangelical resigns from Mars Hill Church, which he founded 18 years ago .

"Obama administration officials said Monday the federal government would not become a willing partner in the state of Arizona's efforts to arrest undocumented people -- unless those immigrants meet federal government criteria. And they said the administration is rescinding agreements that allow some Arizona law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration laws. The administration made the announcement hours after Monday's Supreme Court decision on whether states can enforce immigration laws. Issues and ruling at a glance . In a conference call with reporters, an administration official said the administration will not allow Arizona's immigration priorities to become the Department of Homeland Security's priorities. The official said while DHS expected more calls from Arizona authorities, it will not increase staffing in Arizona to deal with them. ""We have limited resources. It doesn't make sense ... to spend those resources in a scattershot or random fashion. Instead they need to be focused on individuals who pose a public safety threat or challenge the integrity of our borders, and going forth that is how we anticipate handling our response to ... Arizona's law,"" he said. Accordingly, he said, federal officials will not respond to the scene of state or local traffic stops or similar law enforcement encounters to enforce immigration laws unless the individual meets DHS enforcement priorities. To meet those priorities, the individual must be a convicted criminal or a recent border crosser, or must have been removed from the U.S. previously and re-entered unlawfully. DHS will continue to comply with its legal requirement to verify, by telephone, the individual's immigration status, officials said. States affected by ruling . The administration also said it is rescinding the so-called 287(g) agreements with the state of Arizona that allowed some local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. Under the 287(g) program, state and local law enforcement agencies entered into a partnership with DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and were delegated authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions. The program was initiated under the Bush administration, which heralded it as a top immigration enforcement tool.  But the progam has fallen into disfavor with the Obama administration, which said in its 2013 budget proposal that it intended to phase out the program, an administration official said. Five things we learned . Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer responded to the end of the 287(g) agreements with an angry statement Monday. ""As though we needed any more evidence, President Obama has demonstrated anew his utter disregard for the safety and security of the Arizona people. Within the last two hours, I have been notified the Obama administration has revoked the 287(g) agreement under the authority of which Arizona law enforcement officers have partnered with the federal government in the enforcement of immigration law,"" the statement said. ""Since 2006, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security credits the 287(g) program with identifying nearly 300,000 potentially-removable aliens nationwide. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has trained and certified more than 1,500 state and local officers to assist in the enforcement of immigration law, including many in Arizona,"" the statement added. ""In fact, even as the President was wiping out Arizona's 287(g) agreements, the ICE website itself continued to herald the collaborative approach of the 287(g) program, noting, 'Terrorism and criminal activity are most effectively combated through  a multi-agency/multi-authority approach that encompasses federal, state and local resources, skills and expertise.'"" The Justice Department announced it has set up a telephone hotline and e-mail address for the public to report potential civil rights concerns related to the implementation of the Arizona SB 1070 provision requiring immigration status verification during certain law enforcement encounters. The hotline number is 855-353-1010 and the e-mail address is SB1070@usdoj.gov. A Justice Department official said the Arizona hotline was set up in reaction to the Supreme Court's ruling. ""The hotline was not previously set up because the provision had not gone into effect,"" the official said. ""In Alabama, we similarly set up the hotline when its immigration law went into effect,"" the official said, referring to a hotline set up in that state late last year in response to Alabama's immigration reform law law.","Ariz. governor slams end of program that let some state police enforce federal laws .

"(CNN)Months after a troublesome Rolling Stone article detailed rape claims on campus, the University of Virginia has reinstated its chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. The decision came after Charlottesville police told UVA ""that their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi,"" the university said in a statement. ""We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all,"" UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan said. In November, Rolling Stone published ""A Rape on Campus"" featuring a woman identified only as Jackie. In the article, Jackie said she was brutally raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house during a party her freshman year. The article sparked international outrage and put UVA in the spotlight on the issue of campus sexual assault. UVA shut down Greek social life on November 21, two days after the article was published. But there were problems with the reporting. Within days, critics began to question some of the story's details, as well as Rolling Stone's decision not to contact the alleged attackers. The Washington Post, CNN and other news outlets followed up, identifying a number of contradictions and discrepancies. For example, two of Jackie's friends told CNN that numerous details of the alleged attack described in Rolling Stone were entirely different from what Jackie told them that night. And they said that, while it seemed clear that she had been traumatized, they saw no injuries consistent with an attack as vicious as the article describes. Rolling Stone apologized, acknowledging discrepancies and admitting that its writer had not contacted the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie. The magazine also said the writer didn't contact any of the men that Jackie claimed participated in the attack, for fear that they would retaliate against her. ""We published the article with the firm belief that it was accurate,"" the magazine said. ""Given all of these reports, however, we have come to the conclusion that we were mistaken in honoring Jackie's request to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account."" The fraternity's chapter president, Stephen Scipione, said there is still ""an opportunity to move forward with important safety improvements."" ""This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem,"" Scipione said in a statement. ""It's opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault."" Last week, the university reinstated Greek social life and announced new rules fraternities must follow if they want to throw a party. Among them: No pre-mixed drinks. Security at the doors. And sober brothers at every event, guarding the stairs and with key access to each room. CNN's Sara Ganim, Leigh Remizowski and Adam Levine contributed to this report.","The University of Virginia reinstates its Phi Kappa Psi fraternity chapter .

"The welcome message from America's new top diplomat in the Dominican Republic touched on baseball, culture and trade ties. No surprises there. But U.S. Ambassador James ""Wally"" Brewster brought one thing with him this week that's a first for a male U.S. ambassador in the Caribbean nation: a husband. ""My spouse, Bob, and I have traveled the world, from the far reaches of Asia to the stunning coastlines of southern Europe,"" Brewster says in a video introducing himself on the U.S. Embassy's website. Then husband Bob Satawake chimes in: ""But we always return to the beauty of the Dominican Republic."" After months of pressure from religious groups in the Dominican Republic who protested his appointment, Brewster arrived in Santo Domingo this week to begin his tenure as ambassador. U.S. President Barack Obama praised Brewster's ""knowledge and dedication"" when he announced his appointment to the post in June. The Dominican Republic's government quickly said it accepted Brewster's selection. But some have been less welcoming. High-profile Catholic Church leaders have decried the new diplomatic appointment as a sign of a lack of respect from Obama. ""He has not considered the particularities of our people. The United States is trying to impose on us marriage between gays and lesbians as well as adoption by these couples,"" said Father Luis Rosario, director of youth ministries for the church. Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez Rodriguez has also criticized Brewster's selection several times since Obama announced his appointment over the summer. Local media reported that an evangelical church called for ""black Monday"" protests, asking people to show their opposition to Brewster by tying black ribbons on their cars, according to local media reports. Others, including gay rights groups, have praised Brewster's appointment. An editorial in the Dominican Republic's El Nacional newspaper this week discussed proposals Brewster outlined in the introductory video and urged readers to stop focusing so much on the new ambassador's sexual orientation, even though it has ""generated more attention than his diplomatic mission."" Brewster alluded to the debate during his Senate confirmation hearing last month. ""I have already begun to see the challenges and controversies I will face in this job,"" he said, ""but the rewards of representing the American people, creating a more prosperous hemisphere, and strengthening democracy through our evolving relationship with the Dominican Republic will be far greater than any challenge or controversy I will ever encounter."" His arrival in the Dominican Republic this week was front-page news in many of the country's newspapers, which also prominently discussed the arrival of his spouse. A major fundraiser for Obama's 2012 campaign who most recently worked as a senior managing partner of SB&K Global, Brewster has also served on the national board of directors for the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent gay rights group. In a blog post this month, the group described Brewster as the fifth openly gay U.S. ambassador. ""It is a testament to President Obama and the U.S. Senate that the sexual orientation of these ambassadors is irrelevant to their qualifications for their posts,"" the campaign said. In his introductory video, Brewster says that he and Satawake are longtime fans of baseball, which is very popular in the Domincan Republic, and that he's eager to increase economic connections between the United States and the Dominican Republic. ""My parents taught me that all people deserve respect, dignity, love and opportunity. They also instilled in me a strong belief in God, and the values of love and tolerance,"" he says. ""Bob and I bring those beliefs and values with us as we come to the Dominican Republic. We are both thrilled to be coming back to our second home.""","The new U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic is openly gay and married .

"By its own admission, the Australian government's policy on asylum seekers has been overwhelmed, just three months after the passing of new laws aimed at stemming the flow of those seeking refuge in Australia. Since the resurrection of the so-called  ""Pacific Solution,"" under which asylum seekers making their way to Australia by boat are processed offshore, 7,929 people have arrived in Australian waters on 134 boats, according to the Immigration Department. Australian Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said Wednesday that detention facilities on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru would not be able to accommodate all the asylum seekers who had recently arrived and said that ""some of these people will be processed in the Australian community."" At full capacity, Nauru and Manus Island are able to accommodate 2,100 asylum seekers, around a third of the number who have arrived since August 13 when the government announced a return to the policy introduced by the Liberal government led by John Howard in 2001. The decision to process the overload of asylum seekers on the Australian mainland comes as Amnesty International inspectors this week described conditions at the Nauru detention center, where 387 asylum seekers are currently held, as ""appalling."" Amnesty said conditions were so bad that there had been a ""terrible spiral"" of self-harm, hunger strikes and suicide attempts as people waited to be processed. One of several people on a hunger strike at the facility had not eaten for more than 40 days, the group said. The center on Nauru re-opened in August this year. ""In summer, in the heat, it gets to over 40 degrees during the day in those tents and it was certainly very hot and humid when we were in there. When it's raining, as it is now, the tents are leaking and their bedding gets wet at night,'' Amnesty's Graham Thor told reporters during a visit to the island. The government has dismissed the criticism. ""Conditions on Nauru at times may not be pleasant but they are the same conditions immigration staff and service providers are working under,"" Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said. Foreign Minister Senator Bob Carr insisted Wednesday that despite the extraordinarily large number of arrivals, the re-opening of the Nauru facility had deterred people from making the journey. Nor did he think that Amnesty International's observations had damaged Australia's reputation. ""I think Australia stands out in the world as having a humane commitment that I'm very proud of, that all Australians can be very proud of,"" he told the ABC. But for Ramesh Fernandez, the CEO and founder of RISE, a not for profit support group for refugees and asylum seekers, Australia's mandatory detention laws are little more than an illegal form of ""house arrest."" Fernandez, who spent three years in both onshore and offshore processing centers between 2011 and 2004 after fleeing Sri Lanka, said, based on his experience, asylum seekers kept in detention were poorly treated and their complaints ignored. ""Offshore processing centers may lower the number of asylum seekers in Australia, but it is not a viable solution to fairly deal with asylum seekers and it will not put a stop to people coming to this country by boat,"" he told CNN. But as the first group of 19 asylum seekers, or ""irregular maritime arrivals"" as the government calls them, were transferred from Australian territory to Manus Island, the Immigration Minister issued a now familiar warning to those attempting the perilous sea journey to Australia. ""To those contemplating the dangerous journey to Australia by boat: people smugglers are lying to you, don't waste your money and don't risk your life -- it's just not worth it,"" he in a media release. 'There is no visa on arrival, there will be no special treatment, no speedy outcome and certainly no advantage given to those who come by boat."" Those who cannot be accommodated on Manus Island or Nauru would be processed onshore, Bowen said.  Bridging visas would be granted but asylum seekers would not have the right to work and would receive only minimal accommodation assistance. They will still be subject to the ""no advantage"" rule, just like those who were sent offshore for processing, he added. The government also announced Wednesday that 100 Sri Lankan men had been involuntarily returned to their homeland -- the ninth and largest involuntary removal to date. The Immigration Minister said when the men were advised that they were subject to removal from Australia, they raised no issues ""that engaged Australia's international obligations"": they were not considered nor considered themselves to be refugees. Sri Lankans have been returned to Colombo since the Pacific Solution came into effect. Some chose to return to Sri Lanka voluntarily, rather than transfer from the Australian mainland to Nauru. Fernandez believes the men recently deported may have preferred to return to Sri Lanka. ""If people choose to go back where they were persecuted over Nauru, (this) means that they are ready die rather (than) getting rotten somewhere, not able to seek freedom,"" he told CNN. ""It is not a win for the Australian government and the government must be ashamed for creating a rigid refugee policy which persecutes asylum seekers once again,"" he added. For Fernandez, the Australian government has blood on its hands. For Amnesty International, it will come as no surprise that Sri Lankans are opting to return home or putting up little resistance. The human rights group noted after its inspection of Nauru, that asylum seekers believed they were being sent to the island state to be ""driven crazy"" and would prefer to return home.","Nearly 8,000 asylum seekers arrived in Australia since new laws passed 3 months ago .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A police officer in Zimbabwe who has languished at a police detention barracks for a month for using a toilet reserved for President Robert Mugabe will learn his fate at end of this week following an appeal to his boss. Alois Mabhunu, a homicide detective was sentenced last week to 10 days after he was convicted by an internal police court for responding to a call of nature in a toilet which had been reserved for Mugabe at a trade fair in Zimbabwes second biggest city. On Monday, a relative of Mabhunu said the officer was not represented by a lawyer at the hearing, but is hoping the police commissioner-general, Augustine Chihuri, will overturn the guilty verdict this week. He said he had heard that Chihuri will look at the appeal on Thursday or Friday.Besides serving the 10-day sentence, Mabhunu, a homicide detective, has been demoted and will no longer be allowed to wear plain clothes. Contacted for comment, Wayne Bvudzijena police spokesperson on Monday said the issue of Mabhunu was an internal, purely disciplinary matter on which he couldn't comment. Bvudzijen said Mabhunu failed to obey instructions and the law had to take its course. Mabhunu was part of the security team when Mugabe attended the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair last month. He is alleged to have rushed to the VIP toilets reserved for Mugabe and Jean Louis Ekra, head of the African Export Import Bank, who was participating in the opening ceremonies. When he was stopped by other officers guarding the toilets, he obliged, but  he later forced his way in. The following day he was arrested, he has been in custody since then.","Police officer on security team at Zimbabwe trade fair had to go, and used VIP toilet .

"KHARTOUM, Sudan (CNN) -- In an effort to shut down Khartoum's Unity High School, a disgruntled former employee alerted Sudanese officials that a British teacher had allowed her class to name a teddy bear ""Mohammed,"" a British source and Sudanese presidential palace source told Time magazine's Sam Dealey. An undated amateur photo shows Gillian Gibbons, who was jailed for allowing children to name a teddy bear ""Mohammed"". Gillian Gibbons, 54, was convicted last week of insulting religion and sentenced to 15 days in jail and deportation. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir pardoned her from her prison sentence on Monday and she later left on a flight for England. The two sources said Sarah Khawad was fired as the school's secretary in November after an employment spat and threatened to shut down the school. The sources said Khawad did not appear to have a vendetta against Gibbons, but hoped that by bringing the teddy bear incident to the education minister's attention, he would close down the school for anti-Islamic teachings.  Watch Time magazine's Sam Dealey's report on the pardon » . The private school was shut down after the controversy came to light last week. It is unclear if it will reopen. Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, some Muslims consider likenesses highly offensive. The sources said they have confirmed the account with Gibbons. Defense attorneys confirmed that it was Khawad who launched the initial complaint against Gibbons, not a parent as originally thought. Khawad also testified at Gibbons' trial. Before approaching Sudan's education minister, the two sources said Khawad tried to enlist two parents, who were also teachers at the school, to join in her protest against the teddy bear's name, but they declined. Gibbons had been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool this summer, said the head of Unity High School, Robert Boulos. She had asked her class of 7-year-olds to come up with a name for the toy as part of a school project, he said. Classmates took turns taking the teddy bear home with them, accompanied by a diary with the bear's name written in the front of it, he said. She was taken into custody on November 25 and tried days later in a Sudanese court. She was cleared of other charges of inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs. Gibbons had initially faced the possibility of 40 lashes and a six-month jail term for insulting Islam. The incident sparked a diplomatic row, with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband calling on his Sudanese counterpart to dismiss the charges. Two British lawmakers, both Muslims, traveled to Khartoum to help secure her release. It also resulted in angry protests in Khartoum, with some calling for the British woman's execution.

"Ray Nagin came into the mayor's office in New Orleans as an avowed scourge of corruption and led the city through the worst disaster of its modern history. He left a federal courthouse a convict Wednesday, after a jury found him guilty of taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes and other favors from businessmen looking for a break from his administration. Of the 21 counts against him, he was convicted of 20. ""He got a lot of media attention as being a reformer, a non-politician, first run for office -- a businessman who was going to come in and get it right,"" said Pat Fanning, a veteran New Orleans lawyer and no fan of the former two-term mayor. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in 2005, the onetime cable television executive would reassure people queasy about sending taxpayer money to a state with an epic history of corruption by telling them, ""Google me. You're not going to find any of that in my record,"" Fanning said, quoting Nagin. ""Well, Google him now."" Nagin, who left office in 2010, had little to say as he left the courthouse Wednesday afternoon, telling reporters only, ""I maintain my innocence."" A small knot of supporters yelled, ""Keep your head up"" and ""He's just a patsy,"" CNN affiliate WDSU reported. His lead attorney, Robert Jenkins, told reporters his client would appeal the verdict. ""We did the best we could do,"" Jenkins said. Prosecutors argued the 57-year-old Nagin was at the center of a kickback scheme in which he received checks, cash, wire transfers, personal services and free travel from businessmen seeking contracts and favorable treatment from the city. He faces up to 20 years in prison, but Fanning said a 14- to 17-year term was more likely. A January 2013 indictment detailed more than $200,000 in bribes to the mayor, and his family members allegedly received a vacation in Hawaii; first-class airfare to Jamaica; private jet travel and a limousine for New York City; and cellular phone service. In exchange, businesses that coughed up for Nagin and his family won more than $5 million in city contracts, according to the January 2013 indictment. During the two-week trial, prosecutors brought to the stand a string of businessmen who had already pleaded guilty to bribing Nagin. His defense did little to challenge their stories, Fanning said. ""It was too painful actually to watch. They just swamped him,"" he said. And when Nagin took the stand in his own defense, ""He did a belly flop,"" often answering questions on cross-examination by saying he couldn't recall who paid for a trip or perk. ""He just looked terrible,"" Fanning said. The earliest of the charges date from before Katrina, which struck when Nagin had been in office for about three years. The hurricane flooded more than three-fourths of low-lying New Orleans and left more than 1,800 dead across the region -- most of them in Louisiana. Supporters credited Nagin's sometimes-profane demands for aid from Washington with helping reveal the botched federal response to the storm -- a fiasco that embarrassed the George W. Bush administration and led to billions of federal dollars being poured into Gulf Coast reconstruction efforts. But Nagin also had his detractors: Fanning called his performance during the storm ""a meltdown,"" a congressional committee criticized him for delaying evacuation orders, and his frantic description of post-storm New Orleans as a violent wasteland with up to 10,000 dead turned out to be greatly exaggerated. As he sought re-election in 2006, with much of the city's African-American population displaced by storm damage, Nagin was blasted for insisting that New Orleans would remain a ""chocolate"" city. Nagin won a second term despite the controversies, but left office with his approval ratings in the cellar and told CNN his career in public office was over. ""I have given my pound of flesh,"" he said. Nagin sought to have the charges dismissed in October after another federal judge blasted what he called the ""grotesque"" misconduct of prosecutors in the post-Katrina shootings of unarmed civilians by police at the Danziger Bridge. The judge tossed out the convictions of five cashiered cops after ruling that members of the U.S. attorney's office tainted their 2011 trial by anonymously posting ""egregious and inflammatory"" comments at online news sites. Nagin argued that he was the target of the same underground effort, citing ""a continuum of pejorative statements and demeaning racial epithets"" aimed at him. The U.S. attorney's office said none of the prosecutors involved in the Danziger Bridge case played a role in the Nagin investigation.","Nagin ""did a belly flop"" on the witness stand, observer says .

"Washington (CNN)Almost immediately following the news of the first terrorist attacks that eventually killed 17 people across France, the global community united around a Twitter hashtag ""Je suis Charlie"" and just days later foreign leaders linked arms with their French counterparts to lead a historic million-person strong rally. Meanwhile, explosives strapped to a girl who appeared to be about 10-years-old detonated on Saturday, killing at least 20 people, in a country whose encounters with terrorism were also punctuated by a hashtag -- this time ""#BringBackOurGirls"" of Nigeria. Boko Haram militants killed as many as 2,000 people, mostly civilians,in a massacre that started the weekend before the terror attack on Charlie Hedbo in downtown Paris. Both the attacks in Nigeria and those in Paris are shocking and horrifying in their own respects, and yet one fomented an unprecedented international reaction -- a popular show of force that rivaled even the reaction to 9/11 -- while the response to the attacks in Nigeria paled in comparison. Here are a few of the reasons why: . Symbolism . The terrorist attack on the satirical publication Charlie Hebdo was not just violent, but highly symbolic. While the terrorists in Nigeria targeted innocent civilians in a strategic northern town in Nigeria and in a crowded marketplace, the gunmen who stormed the headquarters of Charlie Hebdo took aim at one of the most cherished values in France: freedom of expression. The attack quickly sparked the hashtag and image on social media proclaiming ""Je Suis Charlie,"" I am Charlie. In a way that few nations would, the French people took the attack on Charlie Hebdo as an attack on the very core of their country's constitution and values -- a country where the line between politics and culture blends often seamlessly and where criticism and mockery of public officials rushes toward -- not away -- from controversy. It's a special relationship to a freedom won over and fought for more than once through bloody revolution that even President Barack Obama recognized as he reacted to the Charlie Hebdo shootings. ""No country knows better than France, that freedom has a price because France gave birth to democracy itself,"" he said. And Americans can directly relate to attacks on freedom of speech, former U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria John Campbell said. And beyond the French people's broad reverence for freedom of speech, France is a country heavy on symbolism, embodied by its national motto of ""Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité,"" Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. That symbolism, which drove millions into the streets of Paris, cities around France and around the world, was also quickly seized on by France's President François Hollande, who quickly called for national unity in an address that honed in on France's ardent belief in freedom. And while the reaction to the attacks in Paris evolved naturally through social media, Hollande and his government successfully picked up on the public sentiment and amplified those voices. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, though, had concerns more pressing than issuing a rallying cry of defiance in the face of attacks that again sought to undermine his country's very sovereignty. In fact, while Jonathan issued a statement condemning the attack on Charlie Hebdo and expressing Nigeria's ""full solidarity"" with the people of France, he failed to do the same for the victims of terrorism in his own country. Jonathan is up for reelection next month and the atrocities committed by Boko Haram are the last thing he wants to address. And the attacks in Nigeria have barely resonated within the country's borders, said John Campbell former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria. ""It hasn't even had a very large impact in Lagos,"" Campbell said of Nigeria's most populous city. By contrast, the attacks on freedom of speech resounded strongly not just in France, but around the world. ""Americans can directly relate to attacks on freedom of speech. They can directly relate to terrorism and the impact in France is being compared to the impact of 9/11 in the United States,"" Campbell said. ""Boko Haram by contrast is viewed as a kind of civil war ... and it's all happening a very long way away."" Hollande, however, came face to face with an opportunity -- an opportunity to boost his own sagging political fortunes and to help unify a society increasingly fractured by politics. A country aching for long-lost national unity . The attacks also gave France a shot in the arm, reinvigorating a long-lost sentiment of national unity not seen since at least the last World Cup. Hollande has faced the lowest popularity of any President in French history, with just 13% approving of his leadership at the end of 2014. Driving Hollande's sinking numbers, an economy struggling to reboot has also fueled the historic rise of France's far right party, the National Front.  And after waves of immigration, the National Front and its xenophobic, protectionist platform are thriving on the perception that immigration is changing the color and meaning of the French nationality and challenging the very core of France's identity. But the reaction to the attacks has given the National Front and Marine Le Pen a slap in the face like only Charlie Hebdo -- which regularly lampooned the party and its leader -- could. Le Pen decided not to attend the march after she was not expressly invited, though the event was open to any participants. Instead, the demonstrators in Paris proclaimed a national unity cut in stark contrast to the divisive rhetoric of the National Front. Christians, Muslims and Jews, immigrants and those with deep roots in France joined together to proclaim ""Je Suis Charlie."" But that's not all they proclaimed. Muslims joined others in carrying signs saying ""Je Suis Juif,"" I am Jewish, a powerful statement that countered not only the third gunmen Amedy Coulibaly's targeting of Jews but also increasingly concerning reports of rising anti-Semitism in France that are spurring thousands of French Jews to emigrate to Israel. And all joined in singing ""La Marseillaise,"" the powerful rallying cry that is the French national anthem. Common fears . As much as the terrorist attacks failed in their objective of silencing criticism of their Islamist ambitions, the attacks brought concerns over homegrown terrorists and foreign fighters to the surface -- not just in Europe, but in the United States. The three gunmen who locked down Paris for days were not only French citizens, but two claimed to be affiliated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula while Coulibaly pledged allegiance to ISIS, the Islamist group which has ravaged parts of Syria and Iraq and inspired militants around the world. The attacks have prompted American intelligence officials to scrutinize their terror databases and reassess potential threats, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest discussed the risk countries like the U.S. and France face in taking the fight to ISIS. But the attacks by Boko Haram in Nigeria don't stoke the same fears in the West, former House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers said. ""A lot look at Boko Haram and associate them more as a separatist group than an al-Qaeda minded group. I think that's wrong,"" said Rogers, who is now a CNN National Security commentator. ""If you have a group that is this brutal and shows this much disregard for human life and it's growing and it's trying to recruit people to its cause, this is a huge problem."" Opinion: Boko Haram massacre: 7 questions worth asking . Al Qaeda in the Maghreb (AQIM) was at one time the largest funder of Boko Haram, Rogers said, and AQIM has largely influenced the Nigerian group's tactics. While Boko Haram doesn't present as much of a threat to the U.S. as ISIS, Rogers believes U.S. officials should be more concerned about Boko Haram, particularly as the economies in African countries are booming and much of the continent is looking for trade relationships beyond the continent. Without a sense of urgency or a direct threat, the American and European public are unlikely to react to attacks in Nigeria in the same way as they react to attacks in Paris. And besides Americans have grown numb to the level of violence throughout the African continent, said J. Peter Pham, director of the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council. Boko Haram alone killed an estimated 10,000 people in 2014. ""There's a sense that 'That's Africa, bad things happen. This is Paris, it's a Western country. This shouldn't happen,'"" Pham explained. ""We're conditioned by years of reports coming out of Africa to expect this type of thing in Africa."" Optics and a 24/7 media . People around the world watched for days as the manhunt and later tense standoff unfolded between French security forces and the terrorists. In France, around Europe and in the United States, people connected on social media and reacted in real time as they watched each development unfold on cable news or through dramatic videos posted to YouTube. And that coverage dominated the news cycle, with little if any information popping up on TV about an ongoing massacre in northern Nigeria that would in the end claim 2,000 lives. Instead, most found out late this weekend or on Monday morning about the attack in Nigeria that started on Jan. 3. There are not only fewer reporters and news cameras in Nigeria than in Paris, but access to the northern region of Nigeria where the attacks unfolded is dangerous and practically inaccessible. ""There aren't visuals of Baga and what happened there,"" Pham said of the town ravaged by Boko Haram's militants. In Paris, everything is happening ""in real time,"" he added.","France and Nigeria experienced waves of terrorism during the first weeks of 2015 .
While the terror attacks in Paris sparked international unified outrage, reaction to Nigeria was more muted .
Symbolism, politics and media all played a role in how France's response to terrorism was perceived ."
"Just a few hundred yards from the podium where Paul Ryan spoke to the roaring Republican faithful, 27 undecided Florida voters listened intently to his words. In their hands, they held electronic audience reaction dials, twisting them back and forth to record their approval or disapproval second by second, giving instant feedback and real-time ratings of the speech. This is the battlefront that will determine the election: The candidate who can win the holdouts -- the voters who have yet to make up their minds -- will likely win the whole race this fall. The group of voters was convened by CNN with the assistance of Southern Methodist University in Dallas communication professors Dan Schill and Rita Kirk.  CNN hired the university to conduct the tests but the voters were not compensated. 'Gen Xer' Paul Ryan takes up torch, makes case to young voters . Though the group members declared themselves undecided, they were not neutral. In a series of dial test questions before the speech, the participants made it clear they are generally conservative, moderately religious and  -- while most called themselves independent -- more leaned Republican than Democrat.  Seventy-eight percent of the people in the group rated the economy or the budget deficit as the top issue in the race.  Eighty-five percent indicated they believe the country is going in the wrong direction. In short, most of the dial-testers are ready to see a change in Washington's ways, but while they decidedly disapprove of President Barack Obama's performance, they are ambivalent about whether Mitt Romney can or will do better. Ryan's speech, however, seemed to give many of them at least a mild nudge in Romney's direction. Nearly one in six Americans is living in poverty, the Republican congressman from Wisconsin said to the cheering crowd in the convention hall. Roundup: How did Paul Ryan do? ""Millions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life.  Half of them can't find the work they studied for, or any work at all.""  In the focus group, the men ate it up. The women lagged below the men in their approval until about halfway through the speech, when Ryan began talking about his mother's  struggles to work and raise the family following the sudden death of Ryan's father. ""It wasn't just a new livelihood. It was a new life. And it transformed my mom from a widow in grief to a small businesswoman whose happiness wasn't just in the past."" By and large, all the dial testers responded strongly to Ryan's references to hard work, initiative, and maintaining the American dream. The men and women split when he talked about rolling back health care reform; men liking that idea more, women liking it less. But here is the tough truth for Team Romney: More than half the dial testers came into the evening indicating that if they had to vote right now, ""undecided"" would still win by a landslide.

"A U.S. government warning this week to airlines about possible shoe bombs represents a credible threat linked to al Qaeda, officials told CNN. Recent intelligence points to tactics believed to be tied to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its master bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri, a federal law enforcement official said. Counterterrorism officials don't believe there is an active plot in the works. But the law enforcement source said the United States periodically receives information on attempts by those believed to have been trained by Asiri to try to develop bombs that could defeat screening systems. It's not a new threat, but one viewed as ongoing because they know the al Qaeda unit based in Yemen is constantly trying to improve its bombs. Another U.S. official said the Homeland Security Department would not have taken steps to warn carriers about flights bound for the United States had it not been credible. ""This is not just some flip comment on the part of a bad guy,"" that official said. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday in Los Angeles that ""concern about shoe bombs have been out there for years"" and the agency updates  advisories and modifies procedures ""so that we remain vigilant."" Intelligence collected by the United States and other countries indicates terror groups have been working on new shoe-bomb designs, sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Wednesday. The threat apparently is unrelated to recent warnings about toothpaste and cosmetic tubes potentially being used to hide explosives on flights to Russia. Terrorism experts say airlines continue to be a target of terrorists wishing to make a spectacular impact with an attack. The focus on security since 2001 has shifted from hijackings to bombs, especially those that might be hidden in luggage. Following the 9/11 attacks, passengers aboard an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami thwarted another passenger's attempt to detonate explosives hidden in his sneakers. Richard Reid, a British citizen, pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence. Since, Transportation Security Administration policy requires passengers going through airport security checkpoints to take off their shoes to be X-rayed.","U.S. warned airlines this week about possible shoe bomb threat to U.S.-bound flights .

"Remember that scene at the end of that Facebook Movie (""The Social Network"") when Mark Zuckerberg's character sits alone at a computer screen hitting the refresh button over and over again -- stuck in a loop of anxiety and longing? That's how I felt last week. On June 10, to re-launch a CNN Opinion project called Change the List, my editors and I put forward 20 story ideas for your consideration -- and I agreed to do whatever five stories got the most votes. Meantime, a colleague of mine created an internal Web page so I could monitor, in all-the-time-real-time, which stories were leading the race. That internal website, which had a yellow banner that said, ""CONFIDENTIAL: For internal use only"" at the top of it, was titled ""How John's going to be spending the rest of 2013."" I was nervous about the results because I was excited to know what I would be reporting on, of course -- but, more importantly, because the topics CNN's editors put forward really do matter: the most dangerous roads in the world; America's failing education system; the country where 1 in 100 live births kills the mother. These stories could make a difference. So I checked that website again and again, to the point I briefly developed an eye twitch. This isn't like me, by the way. I'm the kind of person who (usually) sits through dinner without reading texts. But for the seven days the poll was open I turned into some sort of one-function cyborg. Must. Check. Leaders. I'm pleased to tell you the wait is finally over. My eye twitch has subsided and normal life can resume. At 2 p.m. on Monday we closed the poll. And here are the results. These are the Change the List stories for the next year -- with one wild-card topic still to be determined by my editors (who I'm being reallllly nice to this week). 1. America's widening rich-poor gap (16,789 votes) 2. Illegal animal trade (13,276 votes) 3. Where rape is most common (12,996) 4. The world's poorest children (12,820) 5. America's most endangered river (12,002) Each story will focus on an extreme case -- the state with the widest rich-poor gap or the place where rape is most common. Together we'll try to start a conversation that could, in the long run, bump these places off the bottom of their respective lists. I'll announce the first story soon and will reveal the focus of each story (which river is the most endangered, for instance) during the reporting process. I love that each of these stories was chosen by you. I see that as a mandate of sorts. When journalists pitch big projects they sometimes wonder, ""Is this really the best use of my time?"" I don't have those doubts with Change the List. I know I'm working on your behalf -- on the topics you've deemed most important. This is journalism as democracy -- rebalanced to give you power. You're the boss. That's the way it should be. I also think this vote created a pact between us. I know that you'll have my back as I tackle these subjects and ask for your help in gathering info and pushing for change. These are subjects that are too massive to take on alone. I'll need your help. I'll leave you with the rest of the list just so you can get a sense of what your peers on the Internet value. As I wrote last week, I was surprised by these numbers -- not the fact that 32,546 ballots were submitted, but because a story about the economy finished at the top of the list, and several ideas I found to be most interesting (the country with 100,000 new cases of leprosy per year; the place in the United States without Internet access) received relatively few votes. About half of you picked the income inequality story, the winner, which would have been near the bottom of my ballot. Only 9% of the ballots submitted included the leprosy story, which would have been my top pick. All these are worthy subjects. But the vote gave me pause. It made me re-evaluate my news judgment -- and realize how interesting and rewarding it can be to include your perspectives in the story-selection process. You see things I'd miss on my own. And during the vote, you also gave me at least 97 story ideas that could be the basis for the wild card sixth story. How cool is that? I hope you'll follow this project over the coming months -- and participate in its creation. The Change the List homepage -- http://cnn.com/changethelist -- is one place to look for updates. We also have Tumblr, and my personal social networks are listed in the editor's note at the top of the story. Thanks to all who voted. I'm excited for this journey. I must have the best job in journalism. And it's because I have all of you guiding me. Here's the rest of the list, including vote totals: . 6. Where conflict is never-ending (11,566) 7. The state with the highest drop-out rate (10,372) 8. America's most drug-dependent state (8,614) 9. The country ranked lower for free speech than North Korea (8,380) 10. The world's deadliest roads (7,864) 11. Where women aren't in government (7,197) 12. Where you're most likely to be locked up (6,810) 13. Where 9 in 10 don't have toilets (6,332) 14. Where mothers die in childbirth (4,753) 15. Malaria at its deadliest (4,648) 16. Landmines still end lives (4,125) 17. Three countries stand in the way of polio eradication (3,901) 18. No Internet -- in the United States (3,823) 19. The saddest of the rich countries (3,682) 20. Where leprosy is still a scourge (2,781) Was your top story chosen?

"(CNN)Despite the conventional wisdom that Washington is a frozen island of partisanship, a hopeful thaw is underway. For the past year, we have been spearheading a bipartisan effort to update the process of discovering, developing and delivering medical therapies to help people live longer and better lives. After months of listening to experts and stakeholders, the path to faster cures is clearer than ever. We call it the 21st Century Cures initiative, and Congress is about to take a major leap down this road of hope. There are over 7,000 diseases yet we only have cures and treatments for 500 of them. This unacceptable fact led to one simple question: What policies can we enact to help get more cures and treatments to patients? Our review revealed several areas of reform that will close the gap between the science of medicine and the regulations that impact the volume and fate of new therapies. Our legislation will modernize all of these categories, removing outdated hurdles that can prevent innovation from flourishing or from fleeing the United States. First, we must modernize clinical trials to streamline the approval of drugs and devices. Safety has and always will be a top priority. But the old approach of automatically applying a therapy to a broad group of patients is no longer the best path forward, particularly for those diseases for which we do not have a treatment or cure. Technologies like genetic screening can help us target the right treatments to the right group of patients, creating opportunities for smaller, more targeted and effective trials. We will also streamline the paperwork associated with conducting scientific investigations, whether it's making it easier to recruit patients for clinical trials or adapting the operation of trials as we learn new information. Second, we will better integrate the patient perspective into the regulatory process. Building off of the Food and Drug Administration's Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) program, we are looking at ways to help strengthen FDA's efforts to further incorporate the patient's perspective. New public-private partnerships that can help build the science around biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes are one way to produce more collaboration, move toward faster cures and better involve patients. We also will create a predictable process for the qualification of biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes so we can utilize these tools in the development process. Third, we must promote better access to and sharing of information such as genomic and other clinical data to foster more collaboration among researchers. We will also assist developers and entrepreneurs building innovative, patient-focused technologies by removing regulatory uncertainty as they build apps and other new products. With the explosion of technology, we can collect, monitor and analyze information like never before, helping patients stay healthy and adopt healthy habits while also making treatments safer and more effective. Finally, fostering better interoperability and the collection and secure sharing of data for research are other critical components to modernizing the development of treatments. Fourth, we will invest in the future of science. Our legislation will help young, emerging scientists with expanded access to resources and will take steps to ensure federal dollars are invested wisely. Many of our most promising investigators -- many with great ideas and cutting edge training -- are hamstrung by the challenges of securing much-needed support. We will encourage them to conduct research here in the United States, creating jobs and ensuring that patients here at home have access to the most innovative, new treatments. Finally, we will better incentivize new drugs and devices for unmet medical needs. This includes streamlining the premarket process while establishing mechanisms to better capture real world evidence post-market. We can also examine incentives, such as exclusivity or simplifying the reimbursement process, to produce drugs and devices for diseases with unmet needs. America has a strong history of finding solutions to diseases through medical innovation. Today, partnerships with patients and advocates, health care workers and researchers, and government and the private sector can speed the cycle of finding faster cures. Given the rate of recent scientific progress, it's time to modernize policy to move the process of discovery, development and delivery even faster. The 21st Century Cures initiative is a bipartisan effort to melt Washington's polarization and do just that.","There are over 7,000 diseases yet we only have cures and treatments for 500 of them .

"(CNN) -- At first glance, it seems obvious -- of course Twitter and YouTube have the right to take down a video showing the American journalist, James Foley, being beheaded. The question is why taking it down is controversial at all. The answer, I think, shows how important services like Twitter have become, and how this has thrust unexpected responsibilities onto them. Twitter and YouTube both have rules telling users what they can and cannot post, even though the volume of material they deal with necessarily means they're inconsistent in the application of those rules. YouTube's community guidelines go beyond saying that you can't post ""bad stuff"" that's against the law, ""like animal abuse, drug abuse, under-age drinking and smoking, or bomb making."" The site also won't let you post legal content that depicts ""graphic or gratuitous violence."" Twitter's rules are more minimal, explicitly forbidding only porn in your profile photos, threats and harassment, and spam. But, if Twitter wants to add a new rule in response to a grotesquely violent posting, it's perfectly within its rights to do so. That's because YouTube and Twitter are private websites. They don't have to post anything they don't want to. You'd feel the same way if you set up a site for people to post photos of their pets and someone started feeding it pictures of animals being beheaded. Private sites have no obligation to support free speech. Free speech in America means the government can't tell you what not to say in public. If you don't like a private website's rules, go somewhere else on the Web or start your own site. That's how it works and it's how it should work. And yet, it feels different for sites the size of Twitter and YouTube than for a little pet photos site. Our society has higher aspirations for free speech than that the government not censor us. We want a robust, vibrant public sphere in which ideas of every sort are welcomed and debated. And now we have the Internet, the greatest venue for free speech in human history. Would you watch the video? Sort of. Yes, anyone can talk on the Internet. We're no longer held back by the limited real estate of a daily newspaper or by the judgment of an editorial board. But talking on the Internet is like shouting into the ocean unless you find a place where there are lots of people ready to listen. YouTube and Twitter are just such places. Not everyone will hear you, but your voice may not be totally drowned out, for these sites also provide ways for friends to connect with one another and with others who share their interests. That makes sites like Twitter and YouTube especially important to our society. Their special role comes from what's known as ""the network effect"" -- they gain value simply from the fact that there are so many people there. This also makes them difficult to replace, because it would require masses of people to move to a new site that at its start has very few people there to speak with. With a great network effect comes great responsibility. Opinion: What is ISIS hoping its abhorrent beheading video will achieve? We look to Twitter for special care in handling content fairly not only because free speech needs sites with lots of people, but also because Twitter has begun to play a unique and remarkable role in the ecosystem of news so important to informing us as citizens. In one sense, Twitter is just a distribution system for news, most of which has first appeared on a professional news site. But, as the tweets from Ferguson have shown, it has also become the leading platform where news breaks before it gets picked up by the professional media. Twitter's stream of tweets is not only an amazing pool of eyewitness accounts of the sort compiled by journalists in their research, it is also a contextualized, socially refined end product. This puts a special responsibility on Twitter to accept some of the norms of journalism. Twitter is not a news site, but if it were caught removing conservative or liberal tweets, there would be a firestorm for violating a prime journalistic ethic. Twitter has been vested with a responsibility, and a trust, it did not ask for. Removing accounts responsible for propagating a video of the political murder of a journalist does not violate that trust; the national news sites also are not linking to that video. But the fact that we even wonder about Twitter's social and journalistic responsibilities shows how deeply the Internet has transformed our social and media ecosystems.","Video of ISIS beheading U.S. journalist James Foley appears on social media .

"An unlikely ally is offering a glimmer of hope that President Barack Obama can make good on his vow to close Guantanamo Bay before leaving office. Republican Sen. John McCain, a fierce critic of Obama's foreign policy, is about to take the chairmanship of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee. He says it's still possible the war on terror camp in Cuba could be shut down -- but warns that the administration will have to come up with a clear plan to overcome Republican opposition. Asked in a CNN interview whether he was prepared to help his old political foe, despite a congressional ban on sending detainees to the U.S. mainland, McCain said, ""I am prepared to and I think it can be done."" But he warned that ever since he started talking to the administration about Guantanamo Bay in 2009, it had ""never come forward with a plan as to how we treat those individuals that have been judged as too dangerous to ever be released, and that is the hangup."" McCain, himself a former prisoner of war, has long favored closing Guantanamo Bay, which critics say stains the reputation of the United States and is a recruiting tool for terrorists. But key players in Congress, including many senior Republicans, have barred funding for the administration to send remaining inmates elsewhere or to build facilities on the U.S. mainland. Speculation about the camp's future is being stoked by the recent transfers of a group of prisoners to Uruguay last week. The U.S. response to the 9/11 attacks in 2001 is also back in the spotlight because of the recent release of a Senate report on enhanced interrogation tactics critics say equate to torture. McCain said he thought that Republican opposition could be overcome, if the administration laid out exactly how it believed it could close Guantanamo. ""If I went to the members of the committee today and said, 'Look they are going to be moved to a maximum security prison in some location in the United States of America and we have a plan for that transfer, I think most of them would be perfectly happy about that,"" McCain said. Last weekend, the Obama administration sent six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay for resettlement as refugees as part of its plan to depopulate the camp prior to its closure. Four of the former detainees -- Ahmed Adnan Ahjam, Ali Hussain Shaabaan, Omar Mahmoud Faraj, and Jihad Diyab -- are Syrian nationals, while Abdul Bin Mohammed Abis Ourgy is Tunisian, and Mohammed Tahanmatan is Palestinian, according to Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby. RELATED: GOP congressman: We 'ought to rethink' Gitmo transfer policy . I just don't think that is trustworthy,"" McCain said, adding that former inmates needed re-education to ensure they did not return to extremism. ""I am very concerned,"" he said. Republicans complain that released detainees are not sufficiently monitored when they leave Guantanamo Bay, and cite figures saying that nearly 30 percent of those released are back in the fight against U.S. forces. The transfers leave only 136 detainees at Guantanamo Bay, out of an peak population of more than 750. That's the lowest number of inmates at the base in Cuba since detainees started arriving in 2002. Gitmo inmate: My treatment shames American flag . But that leaves the most problematic prisoners, including those who the administration says are too dangerous to be released, and cannot be tried in civilian courts as they are considered enemy combatants or the evidence against them is seen as tainted because it was obtained under duress. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that Obama remained determined to close Guantanamo Bay, and was prepared to use executive power to do so if Congress would not go along. Since he won re-election in 2012, Obama has appointed special envoys at the Defense and State departments to try to get foreign countries to accept more foreign detainees. He has also lifted the moratorium on lifting sending Yemeni prisoners back home. Nearly all Guantanamo prisoners are being held without charges, and while about half of those are considered high-level threat detainees, the remainder were determined to be low-level threats by a task force of top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Those in the latter group could gain their freedom, provided security conditions could first be met in their host countries. In December 2010, Congress amended the annual defense budget bill to prevent the transfer of any Guantanamo detainees to the United States. That defeated the Obama administration's plans announced a year earlier to try several Guantanamo detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in U.S. federal court.

"George Zimmerman -- who was acquitted earlier this month on murder charges tied to Trayvon Martin's death -- was stopped this weekend for speeding in northern Texas, according to police. Zimmerman was apparently traveling with a gun when he was pulled over. Dashcam video released by Forney, Texas, police shows him and a police officer talking briefly before the officer tells him to shut his glove compartment . ""Don't play with your firearm, OK?"" the officer says. The Forney police officer ultimately sends Zimmerman off with a verbal warning to ""slow down."" In a tweet, Zimmerman's defense team said Wednesday that they would protect his privacy and wouldn't make any comments on their client's whereabouts ""for his safety."" His brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., explained what happened with a brief tweet of his own: ""A heavy foot ... Nothing more."" The traffic stop occurred shortly after noon on Sunday. The dashcam video shows the officer turning on his sirens and saying, ""Get 'em,"" as Zimmerman's 2008 gray Honda pulls away. Moments later, the officer pulls up behind Zimmerman's car, which is by then parked in the breakdown lane with its hazard lights on. The officer asks for a driver's license, and after a short exchange with Zimmerman and recognizing the name, he says, ""What a coincidence."" ""The reason you were stopped is for your speed,"" the officer adds later. ""And as long as you don't have any warrants, you'll be served a warning."" The entire episode -- from when Zimmerman was stopped to when he was cleared -- took about four minutes, according to the police report. Forney City Manager Brian Brooks said he couldn't answer several questions about the incident, including about the type of gun that Zimmerman apparently had, in part because the incident was short and no citation was issued. Zimmerman helps family out of overturned SUV . A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder on July 13 for fatally shooting the 17-year-old Martin in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. After the trial, the Sanford, Florida, Police Department turned over all evidence related to its investigation into Zimmerman -- including a gun -- to federal authorities weighing whether to pursue a civil rights case against him, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The case stirred fervent emotions on both sides -- from the 29-year-old's supporters who argued that he had a right to protect himself, to others who argued he profiled the black teenager, then willfully ignored a police dispatcher's advice by pursuing him. The passions contributed to an ""enormous amount of death threats"" against Zimmerman and his family, his parents told ABC News earlier this month. After the trial, Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara described his client as a marked man who wore a disguise and often strapped on body armor when he left home. ""He has to be very cautious and protective of his safety because there is still a fringe element who have said ... that they will not listen to a verdict of not guilty,"" O'Mara said. Given such concerns, Robert Zimmerman Jr. told CNN's Piers Morgan after the verdict that he didn't see ""any reason why (George) shouldn't"" have a gun. ""I think he has more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him because they express they're trying to kill him, all the time, every day, on my Twitter feed, on the Internet,"" Robert Zimmerman Jr. said. In a statement released Wednesday, after news got out about the weekend traffic stop, Zimmerman's family made no mention of George carrying a gun then or at any time. But they reiterated that he, and other family members, remain under pressure. ""Our family receives many death threats,"" the family said. ""We all continue to take our security seriously and to ensure our safety in accordance with the law."" This week's incident in Texas marks the second time George Zimmerman has made headlines since his acquittal. Zimmerman was mentioned in news stories for helping, with another man, a family of four get out of an overturned vehicle in Sanford, said Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Heather Smith. Zimmerman did not witness the July 17 crash, and he left after making contact with a sheriff's deputy, Smith said. No injuries were reported.

"(CNN) -- ""The guys would say they'd be tortured so bad, they'd be screaming, 'Tell me what you want me to say! Tell us what to say and we'll say it!' They'd agree to confirm anything State Security wanted."" The words are those of one Egyptian speaking to Human Rights Watch - and alleging torture by Egypt's security services against his fellow detainees. Another man, a 22-year-old taxi-driver, told HRW last year about his detention by Egyptian police: ""They had whips and hit me on the legs, on the bottom of my feet, and on my back. When they took me down, they brought a black electric device and applied electro-shocks four or five times to my arms until it started smoking."" They are two of many cases documented by Human Rights Watch in a 96-page report on mistreatment of detainees in Egypt entitled ""Work On Him Until He Confesses: Impunity for Torture in Egypt."" The report, which was published Monday but compiled before the current unrest, concludes that the Egyptian security forces carry out torture and ill-treatment of detainees with impunity and the ""government is failing miserably to provide victims of torture and ill-treatment effective remedy."" The international human rights group says those guilty of human rights abuses have little expectation or reason to fear they will be held to account. It cites the Egyptian government's own figures that criminal courts convicted only six police officers of such abuses between 2006 and 2009. The Foreign Affairs Ministry reported to HRW that 10 other officers were acquitted, and three received suspended sentences. The Interior Ministry said that it had reduced the salaries of 47 officers, suspended 17, issued one warning and acquitted 11. There were at least 70 cases (some involving more than one officer) referred to the courts or a disciplinary tribunal during that period. It's not clear how many complaints are filed each year, but HRW said that human rights lawyers have documented numerous incidents that never reached court. The Egyptian government told a U.N. panel in November 2009 that ""the Office of the Public Prosecutor investigates every complaint it receives about torture or cruel treatment."" CNN was unable to get a response from the Egyptian government on the report. In the event that officers are convicted of ill-treatment, the law does not provide meaningful penalties that might represent a deterrent, HRW said. Abuses are classified into three categories -- contraventions (a fine of less than US$17 or 100 Egyptian pounds), misdemeanors (a fine of more than US$17 or a jail term) and felonies (prison, prison with hard labor or the death penalty). Torture and ""assault leading to death"" are felonies; cruelty and other categories of assault are classified as misdemeanors. According to the Egyptian penal code, any official ""who deliberately resorts, in the course of duty, to cruel treatment in order to humiliate or cause physical pain to another person shall be subject to a penalty of up to one year's imprisonment or a fine of up to EGP200 (US$34)]."" Assault leading to death carries a prison sentence of three to seven years in prison, possibly with hard labor. ""The result is an epidemic of habitual, widespread, and deliberate torture perpetrated on a regular basis by security forces against political dissidents, Islamists allegedly engaged in terrorist activity, and ordinary citizens suspected of links to criminal activity or who simply look suspicious,"" the report concludes. One case highlighted by HRW is that of Khaled Said, a young businessman in Alexandria whose death prompted street protests last year against police brutality and has been a rallying cry in the current protests. He was accosted by police at an Internet cafe because he had posted a video online allegedly showing police dividing up drugs seized in a bust. The son of the cafe's owner told HRW: ""They grabbed his head and banged it against the marble shelf. At this point we tried to get them outside, thinking that they wanted to arrest him, but they dragged him into the entrance of the building next door....They kicked him so hard that he fell on the stairs. They held him by the throat and by the hair and banged his head against the stairs."" An official autopsy said Said died after swallowing a bag of drugs, but photographs of his body showed severe injuries. Human Rights Watch says the State Security Investigations (SSI) is responsible for the disappearance of many people. ""SSI officers will summon individuals or arrest them, after which he or she ""disappears"" for a period of time, usually up to two or three months...Longer-term detention occurs at SSI headquarters in Cairo according to recent witness testimony and human rights groups."" One such detainee, according to his lawyers, was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Nasr al-Sayed Hassan Nasr, who was allegedly held blindfolded for 60 days last year. Nasr told HRW that his interrogators warned him: ""This is the biggest citadel in the Middle East for extracting information. You are 35 meters below the ground in a place that nobody except the Minister of Interior knows about."" His account is consistent with the findings of a UN Human Rights Council mission to Egypt in 2010 that found: ""There is an alarming lack of judicial oversight of facilities run by SSI, which as such are not subject to any inspections of the kind referred to above. With this in mind it becomes difficult to fully ignore many reports about terrorist suspects being arrested, transferred to, and held incommunicado in what are mainly referred to as SSI secret underground cells."" In February 2010, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry responded to accusations by HRW: ""There is no truth to the allegations regarding the unlawful detention of some individuals inside State Security Intelligence headquarters. In Egyptian law no citizen can be unlawfully detained."" HRW says the Egyptian government maintains that incidents of torture are isolated -- and the Ministry of Interior tends to respond to accusations of torture ""by denying the facts, discrediting the complainant, and pointing to training programs and internal disciplinary measures."" It says there is significant gap between the number of torture incidents that victims or their families document or file with prosecutors, and the very small number of complaints that prosecutors transfer to court and result in convictions. The HRW report says the offices of the Public Prosecutor in Egypt ""operates very much as an instrument of the executive"", despite its formal independence as a judicial body. ""Another factor contributing to impunity is the clear conflict of interest that arises when police are involved in investigating allegations of abuse within their own ranks,"" it says. In its recommendations, Human Rights Watch urges the Egyptian government to take steps towards ending torture and ensuring effective investigations. ""Officials at the highest levels, including the president and minister of interior, should publicly acknowledge the scope of torture in Egypt and declare that they will tolerate neither torture nor ill-treatment."" And it adds: ""The ministry of interior should immediately end the illegal practice of enforced disappearance and detention in SSI offices, and allow prosecutors to conduct unannounced visits to such sites to verify compliance.""","A 96-page Human Rights Watch report details cases of detainee mistreatment .

"A Sudanese lawyer filed an appeal Thursday for a pregnant woman sentenced to death this month for refusing to renounce her Christianity. The filing asks the appeals court to reverse the verdict by the lower court and free Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27. Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, was convicted of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith. She is  in prison with her 20-month-old son, but the toddler is free to leave any time, according to her lawyer, Mohamed Jar Elnabi. Her husband, Daniel Wani, is a U.S. citizen who uses a wheelchair and ""totally depends on her for all details of his life,""  her lawyer said. The appeal . The appeals court in Khartoum will issue a ruling on the case in the next week, but it will first ask the lower court to submit the documents it used to make the ruling, according to her lawyer. Once that's done, it will issue a case number, he said. ""We will continue checking with the appeals court, but Inshallah (Allah willing) ... the appeal court will reverse the sentence  and set her free,"" he said. Christian or Muslim? Ibrahim says her father was a Sudanese Muslim and her mother was Ethiopian Orthodox. Her father left when she was 6, and she was raised as a Christian. The court had warned her to renounce her Christianity by May 15, but she held firm to her beliefs. Sudanese Parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen said claims she was raised as non-Muslim are untrue. She was raised in an Islamic environment, and her brother, a Muslim, filed the complaint against her, according to Al-Deen. The complaint alleges that she went missing for several years, and her family was shocked to find out she married a Christian, according to her lawyer. However, because her father was Muslim, the courts considered her one too, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. Attempts to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister for comment were unsuccessful. 100 lashes . In addition to the death sentence, the court convicted her of adultery and sentenced her to 100 lashes. The Parliament speaker has said the verdict is not final and will go through all the judicial stages to reach the constitutional court. Worldwide condemnation . Rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide condemned the verdict. ""The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered,"" said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher. Katherine Perks with the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies said the verdict goes against Sudan's ""own constitution and commitments made under regional and international law."" Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the government to reverse course. In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende.

"While winter is a distant memory for most Americans, it continues unabated in Anchorage, Alaska -- where a new bout of precipitation this weekend helped the city break its record for seasonal snowfall, at more than 133 inches (3.38 meters). Some 3.4 inches of snow  -- and counting -- had fallen as of 4 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) Saturday in Anchorage, according to the National Weather Service. That brought the seasonal total for the city to 133.6 inches -- breaking the record of 132.6 inches, set in 1954-1955. And with snow continuing to fall into early Sunday morning, the figure promises to get even larger. ""Okay...now the records broken, could you please make the snow go away??!!"" wrote one commenter of the Facebook page of the weather service's Alaska division. Another said, ""Oh, it's not chilly. I'm wearing a tee-shirt and shorts while cooking outside and enjoying this beautiful springtime weather @ 35 degrees."" While snow is nothing new to Alaskans, this year's record haul in Anchorage is notable given that the average seasonal snowfall is 74.5 inches. And it's also striking considering that, elsewhere in the United States, this past winter was known more for its warmth than its white stuff. Across the United States, the 2011-2012 winter season was the fourth warmest ever recorded, according to the National Climatic Data Center. The agency's report, issued in March, found that a relative dearth of snow throughout the contiguous United States contributed to snow cover levels in North America being the fourth lowest since such records were first kept. Still, as much as Anchorage residents can revel in being standouts when it comes to snow in their country, they hardly merit top billing in their own state. Other record-setters in the state include Haines, a community about 92 miles north of Juneau that  saw about 360 inches of snow for the 2011-2012 season -- smashing the previous record of 309 inches set five years ago, according to the weather service.","Anchorage has had more than 133 inches of snow for the 2011-2012 season .

"Under an almost cloudless sky, family members gathered and soldiers marched in full military dress. Taps echoed in the wind. A wreath of red, white and blue flowers was placed on a grave. It is a solemn ritual repeated multiple times daily, year-round at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. But this ceremony on Tuesday at the resting place of Army Pvt. William Christman carried particular significance. Christman, a civil war soldier, was the first to be buried at Arlington and the graveside remembrance was held to mark the start of the cemetery's 150th anniversary commemoration, which will continue through June 16. Over that century-and-a-half, more than 400,000 active duty service members, veterans and their families have been buried there, according to the cemetery's website. Presidents, astronauts, Supreme Court justices and other notable Americans also have been laid to rest at Arlington. ""It's a place that is consecrated by all the heroes that are buried here,"" said Jack Lechner, the cemetery's deputy superintendent. ""We have heroes here from every war that the United States has fought in from the Revolutionary War on."" The initial property belonged to George Washington's extended family and then to Robert E. Lee, who left it at the start of the Civil War. Federal troops used it as an encampment, and the federal government purchased 200 acres in 1864 and established a cemetery. More than 600 acres now, Arlington is mostly known for dignified rows of white marble headstones that sweep down an expansive, rolling tree-lined slope where the hallowed ground almost touches the Potomac River. The cemetery is also a year-round tourist attraction with 250,000 visitors each month. Many flock to the most well-known grave -- that of President John F. Kennedy. It is marked by the flickering ""eternal flame."" For Phil Doyle and his family, visiting from Australia, it was one stop they knew had to be made especially with one of their sons training to be a helicopter pilot in the Australian Forces. ""It's an emotional thing walking in and seeing all the tombstones.  It really hits you hard,"" said Doyle. ""It's one of enormous sacrifice by so many people."" Rebecca McCarley, a police officer from Oklahoma City, has visited the cemetery before and says she is overcome by feelings of extreme gratitude. ""It is absolutely awe inspiring the change of the guard by the Tomb of the Unknown. It's such a huge sacrifice people made so that we could be free."" Barbara Christman Page, Christman's great-grandniece, had been to the cemetery before. But she was never aware there was a family grave site, something she will make sure to change for her grandchildren. ""It is so important. It also made us think that we need to pass this story on as opposed to just letting it stop right here,"" Page said. ""We are going to make sure that they know.

"You probably won't see executives from Comcast and Netflix cozying up at some corporate event anytime soon. In its second such complaint this week, Netflix told U.S. Sen. Al Franken that Comcast's takeover of Time Warner Cable would give the merged cable behemoth the leverage to extract higher fees from content providers, costs that would ultimately be passed on to consumers. ""The proposed merger will result in online video content providers paying higher prices for access to Comcast customers or delivering poorer service to customers who depend on Comcast for broadband access,"" wrote Netflix Vice President Christopher Libertelli in a letter to Franken. ""Ultimately, competition and consumers will suffer,"" he continued in the letter, made public by Franken's office Thursday. ""That is why Netflix opposes the merger."" Netflix's letter to Franken came on the heels of its Monday letter to shareholders, in which CEO Reed Hastings and CFO David Wells argued a merged Comcast-TWC could ""charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers."" Of course, Netflix is no impartial observer in this deal. The company pays Comcast for access to its vast network of U.S. cable subscribers and does not want to absorb any fee hikes imposed by a newly dominant Comcast-TWC. Comcast fired back this week, accusing Netflix of distorting the facts. ""Netflix should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about Net Neutrality,"" said Comcast senior Vice President Jennifer Khoury in a rebuttal posted online. ""Rather, it's about improving Netflix's business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the Internet and not just to Netflix customers."" The dispute comes as the Federal Communications Commission is proposing new rules that would allow Internet providers such as Comcast to create a ""fast lane"" for certain websites and services. The rules have drawn fire from advocates of net neutrality, the concept that access to the Internet should be equal for everyone. With Franken, Netflix may be preaching to the choir. The senator from Minnesota has been a vocal critic of the Comcast takeover. ""The danger in allowing Comcast to accrue even more power is not purely hypothetical. The company is already using its dominant position to dictate terms to content providers seeking to reach its 20 million customers,"" Franken wrote in an opinion piece published on CNN.com earlier this month. Franken has no real say in whether the $45 billion merger will be approved, however. That power rests with the Department of Justice and the FCC, whose regulators must decide whether the deal violates antitrust laws. A combined Comcast-Time Warner Cable would bring cable or Internet service to about 30% of American subscribers and serve 19 of the country's 20 largest metropolitan regions. That would bolster Comcast's current status as the nation's largest TV, Internet and home phone provider.","Netflix sent U.S. Sen.

"Apart from what they do for the military; drones have already proven themselves capable sheep herders, delivery boys, tour guides, filmmakers, archaeologists, and -- possibly -- spies. The global economic potential of these machines is astounding; a recent study estimated the worldwide market for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)  at $89 billion in 2013. Proponents are eager to point out the many ways they're going to make our lives better. ""Really, this technology is an extra tool to help an industry be more effective,"" says Gretchen West, the executive vice president for the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI). ""With precision agriculture, for example, it can take pictures of fields so farmers can identify problems they wouldn't necessarily see walking through the fields. In law enforcement, you could find a child lost in the woods more easily than walking through a field, particularly if there's bad weather or treacherous ground."" While it may seem that drones are set to take over our lives, the reality is a bit more complicated. Drone usage around the world is definitely picking up in the public sector, but when it comes to commercial activity, many countries have strict limitations. Opinion: Bad laws could hurt good drones . The United States doesn't allow for commercial drone usage at all, though that's expected to change in 2015, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aims to put a plan in place to integrate drones in U.S. airspace. In the meantime, says West, the U.S. is losing $10 billion in potential economic impact for every year the FAA delays. ""I think the U.S. has been the leader in this technology, and I think there's a risk of losing that first-mover aspect the longer we wait on regulations,"" she says. ""A lot of countries are allowing for flight, and that puts us at a disadvantage. We're seeing U.S. manufacturers realize they're developing great products they can't use here, and they're looking to overseas to fulfill their business model."" Currently, civilian drone use in the U.S. is only sanctioned in a handful of incidents, namely in the public sector, as research or as a hobby, though the latter dictates they don't fly above 400 feet, near populated areas or outside of the operator's line of vision. While this means that ostensibly, non-military manufactures are restricted to making hobby models, most of these can take on commercial applications. ""We're amazed at the uses that pop up,"" says Sue Rosenstock, a spokesperson at 3D Robotics -- an American manufacturer of hobbyists UAVs. In addition to catering to enthusiasts locally, Rosenstock estimates that half their business is done overseas in countries with fewer restrictions. One of the most open countries, she notes, is Australia. The Outback recently made headlines when Australian start-ups Zookal and Flirtey announced they would team up to provide textbook deliveries via drones by next year. Read more: How robots learn from insects . ""We see them as a wonderful example of the power of legislation to free up this emerging technology,"" says Rosenstock. Despite the infancy of the industry, many lawmakers fear the potential invasion of privacy that drones portend. Nine U.S. states have already passed laws restricting drone use, both in the hands of private citizens and law enforcement agencies. ""Drones make surveillance cheaper and easier, and when you do that, you can expect to see a lot more of it,"" warns Ryan Calo, a law professor at the University of Washington School of Law and an affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet Society. While Calo argues that the ease with which the government can spy on us ""should be a concern"", he also says that drones could be useful in starting a long overdue conversation about privacy law. ""Privacy law has lagged behind surveillance technology for years, and it probably has to do with the fact that citizens can't envision what the problem is, but they can picture what drone surveillance would feel like,"" he says. As a result, he argues, drones ""could be a catalyst for better privacy law.""","Though drones have incredible commercial potential, most countries restrict its use .

"An imposing ancient floor mosaic depicting a man driving a chariot drawn by horses and led by the Greek messenger god Hermes is the latest in a series of remarkable finds archaeologists have unearthed in the largest ancient tomb found in Greece, at Amphipolis in the country's north. As experts try to get to the heart of this complex and delicate structure, excavation works have revealed the large floor mosaic, 10-feet wide and 15-feet long, full of tiny pebbles of white, black, blue, red and yellow. Other finds inside the tomb include two magnificent caryatids, sculpted female figures like those found at the Acropolis in Athens. Each figure has one arm stretched, as if to keep intruders out of the main chamber. With every find revealing the further wealth of the tomb, excitement grows as to who was buried at the site. Dating from the fourth century BC, obvious links lead to Alexander the Great. Some say it may be the king's wife, Roxane, or his mother, Olympias. And while historic accounts show that Alexander is buried elsewhere, his tomb has not been found, fueling further speculation. Since the excavation began in August, hundreds of tourists and local day-trippers have flocked to Amphipolis hoping to catch a glimpse of the site, while local media are filled with lengthy reports of the archaeologists progress. Bets and sweepstakes have also appeared to guess the occupant of the tomb, some less serious than others, with names like ""Indiana Jones"" popping up. A visit to the site by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, who has described it as very important, has increased local certainty about the significance of the tomb. Despite what historians say, there are many who argue that only Alexander could be buried in such opulence. The government is warning against unfounded reports but at the same time continues fueling public interest, with almost daily reports from Amphipolis on state broadcaster Nerit. Broadsheet Kathimerini in an article this week wondered whether the ""Amphipolis Syndrome"" is largely a product of the financial crisis that the country has been experiencing for the last six years. The crisis ""did not only dry social funds and pockets but also revealed a cultural deficit,"" the newspaper said. It questioned whether this is an attempt to restore Greece's tarnished image and boost national pride and morale that includes elements of a strategy that will see the government's popularity increase at a time when polls put ruling New Democracy 10 percentage points behind the main opposition, leftist Syriza. There is such a wealth of heritage in Greece, often referred to as ""the cradle of civilization,"" that there is no denying that antiquity remains one of its strongest cards, and with tourism being its second largest moneymaker after shipping, the country is keen to promote it further. Only days ago at a presentation at the Archaeological Museum of Greece's second city, Thessaloniki, a team of Greek experts  confirmed that bones found in a royal tomb at Vergina, also close to Amphipolis, are those of the Macedonian King Philip II, Alexander the Great's father. As Greece looks to the past to move forward at a time of crisis, it is also preparing to bring back to the limelight a cultural cause celebre, that of the Parthenon marbles housed at the British Museum in London. Greece says they were removed illegally and is asking for their repatriation. Three prominent lawyers have arrived in Greece for talks with the government to explore the legal route for the marbles' return. And there are few people who are likely to attract more attention than the youngest of the three, 36-year-old Amal Alamuddin, who recently became Mrs. George Clooney after marrying the Hollywood star in Venice. The Oscar-winning actor took the audience by surprise when he called on Britain to return the marbles to Greece in February during a news conference for his film ""The Monuments Men,"" which deals with the recovery of artworks stolen by the Nazis. Responding to a question by a Greek reporter, he said, ""I think you have a very good case to make about your artifacts."" Alamuddin has been involved in the issue since 2011, yet her high-profile visit, her first public viewing since her marriage with Clooney, is expected to further raise international interest in Greece's antiquity.","There is speculation the find in northern Greece is related to Alexander the Great .

But everyone in economy wants that seat,"" explains Ken Harris, the founder and CEO of Plusgrade, the software company that developed the system. ""The idea was to help correct that, and do it intelligently."" The setup works differently for each airline, depending on their specifications. Some carriers offer upgrades to First Class as well. Who is allowed to participate in the bidding process also varies. Often, the selection process is determined by the route and the number of leftover premium seats. On occasion, a customer's frequent flyer status might also come into play. Furthermore, bidding is blind; customers enter how much they're willing to pay, and if that number exceeds other bids (and the airlines keep that information top secret), they win. The cost of an upgrade is extremely variable, depending on the airline, season and route. Carriers are shy to reveal how much is necessary in securing a winning bid, though it's fair to say the price is less than a full-fare,  Business Class ticket. The concept has gained traction with the airline community. A dozen carriers have already introduced upgrade auctions to their websites with the help of Plusgrade and he expects to double that number before the year is out. Still, one can't help but wonder if the airlines risk eating into their premium revenues. Jamie Baker, an airline analyst at JP Morgan, says it's a possibility. Read more: Baggage drop goes DIY . ""If airlines make it too easy to pay for an upgrade, it might dilute what the traveler would initially be willing to pay for that ticket,"" he notes. ""As a result, airlines tend to control the capacity of award seats. There's a certain amount of experimentation in the process that is required."" Harris, however, seems confident the bidding system will not impact premium-seating sales. ""There's no guarantee that simply because you've requested an upgrade, you'll receive it,"" he says. ""If you want to sit in Business Class and your budget allows you to do so, you should buy that seat. It's the only guarantee you won't be sitting in the back of the plane on your next trip across the ocean."" Austrian Airlines has one of the more democratic approaches to the process. Everyone, regardless of frequent flyer status, can bid on an upgrade, assuming any are available on the flight in question. The airline isn't worried about hurting their profits, because they view the full-fare seats and auction upgrades as two different products, even though passengers who win an upgrade receive the exact same benefits as someone who paid up front, including access to premium lounges and extra baggage allowances. Read more: Your own private luxury jet . ""This product is for a completely different type of group,"" explains Stephanie Kunath, Austrian's director of revenue management and business development. ""It's not for the business traveler who really wants to fly Business Class and needs a 100% guarantee that he can. It's for the passenger that just wants to treat himself for a little extra, and can live with the uncertainty."" While bidding for seats might not hurt an airline's bottom line, the advent of these auctions will likely eat away at the number of free upgrades awarded passengers. ""It probably will erode the complimentary upgrade process to a certain degree, and airlines do run the risk of offending their elite traveler, who has become accustomed to complimentary upgrades,"" says Baker. Harris, however, argues that free bump-ups are the stuff of fantasy. ""Free upgrades are really only given by necessity in operational situations or given to frequent flyers,"" he says. ""The idea that you can simply smile at a ticket agent and get gifted a free upgrade is a romantic notion. It simply doesn't happen.""","Many airlines offer passenger chance to 'blind bid' for an upgrade .
Iberia is the latest airline to offer customers the chance via an online auction.
Plusgrade, the company that developed the software, has already signed on a dozen carriers."
"""Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in...."" my wife Ana blurted into a song this week, as she gazed eastwards through the window of our apartment in downtown Beijing. The old tune from the Broadway show ""Hair"" seemed apt. This is the fourth consecutive morning that we woke up staring at a grey haze. It's another bad-air day in Beijing. You can barely see. You can barely breathe. But you can feel -- and even taste -- the grit floating in the air. The World Health Organization has set healthy level of Air Quality Index at 25 micrograms, while Beijing considers a 300 reading as ""Bad"" and 500 as ""Hazardous."" Last weekend, however, it breached 700! ""I'm getting itchy,"" complained my daughter Michelle, 22, visiting us from New York. ""I could feel it at the back of my throat."" Longtime expatriate residents in the Chinese capital jokingly call it the ""Beijing tickle,"" a nagging cough that takes a long time to shrug off. Beijing adopts emergency measures for hazardous pollution . Air pollution is a major problem in China because of the country's rapid pace of industrialization, reliance on coal power, explosive growth in car ownership and the sometimes disregard for environmental laws. It is now paying the price of rapid development. In 2007, China overtook the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. It is also the No. 1 source of carbon emission worldwide, state-run China Daily reported recently. Added to this, the World Bank says 20 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in China. Health is the big casualty. Almost 400,000 premature deaths are recorded in China each year, with the majority related to pollution, according to the World Bank's ""Cost of Pollution in China,"" a report based on official Chinese figures. A growing number of individuals and institutions are looking to find last-gasp solutions. The government has already shut down high-polluting factories, built new subway lines, and allocated state subsidies to reduce the cost of public transport. Beijing bans vehicles from the road one day a week to reduce heavy traffic and vehicle emissions. It also imports natural gas from other provinces to rely less on coal for heating and cooking. As part of a long-term solution, Chinese researchers are producing prototypes of solar and electric cars to replace gas-fueled vehicles. So far, these measures have not produced consistently blue skies and clean air. Green activists complain that even though government regulations have improved, laws are often ignored. One of Beijing's big problems has been the city's geography, as it is surrounded by mountains shaped like a horseshoe. When pollution blows in from the heavily industrial neighboring towns and cities, it builds up and, in windless days, gets trapped over the capital. Off-the-charts pollution in China . In fact, this is not the first time bad air has bedeviled Beijing. I remember one day last year when the U.S. embassy's air monitoring system reported the pollution level as ""crazy bad."" What can we Beijing residents do about it? Wear face masks? Unless you use heavy-duty ones, I am told, they do not really make much difference. Turn on air-purifiers full blast? We've never used one at home, although my friends swear they help. ""The truth is there isn't a lot people can do about ambient air pollution,"" said Deborah Soligsohn, an environment and energy specialist at the World Resources Institute, a U.S. based think tank. ""Ambient air pollution is not nearly as large a health risk as more immediate forms of air pollution.  Tobacco is a much larger killer, and indoor air pollution from poorly ventilated wood and coal fires has traditionally been a much larger killer in the developing world. Smoky restaurants and bars can have levels as high as these recent air pollution numbers."" I know a few expat friends who have decided to relocate out of Beijing and were mainly turned off by its bad air. ""What did you think of Beijing?"" I asked David Van Dyke, who lived and worked in Beijing for nearly seven years before relocating to Canada last year. ""Mostly liked it, save for the Internet (censorship) and pollution,"" he said. Meantime, some residents have resorted to humor and sarcasm online to vent their frustration. ""I love my city, but I refuse to be a human vacuum cleaner,"" netizens re-tweeted on Weibo, China's microblogging social media. ""We want clean air, and we want to breathe freely."" Others posted pictures wearing face masks of various shapes and designs. A page of Sohu.com featured a section covered with haze, with a note saying the headlines have been obscured by a massive smog.  ""Click on it, and it will clear up."" Once it cleared it, the title read: ""We live in a ""toxic gas.'"" ""Don't worry,"" Henry Ngo posted on my Facebook page. ""Smokers are inhaling worst air than this. And they did not die immediately!"" Is this now the new ""normal""? Soligsohn, who lived in Beijing for 14 years, does not think so. ""This is a confluence of bad events,"" she assured me. ""Pollution is definitely a problem. It hasn't gone away, but there is no reason to believe an extreme reading is anything other than an extreme."" There seems to be no quick solution. ""This is complex and takes time, but the work has begun,"" Soligsohn added. ""It took cities like London and Los Angeles almost half a century to get from really dirty air to pretty clean air, and LA has never actually fully met EPA standards, which have become tougher with new information."" Five days after what some have dubbed Beijing's ""air-mageddon,"" the sunshine has reappeared, and the air has actually turned relatively clear. My daughter points out that London and Los Angeles have confronted pollution as well. As long as the Chinese recognize it is a problem, they will eventually be able to strike a balance between a clean environment and a thriving economy."" Wind has dispersed some of the smog, although my chest remains heavy and my throat is still itchy.","FlorCruz: On bad days in Beijing, seeing, breathing is difficult .

"Thailand's military declared Thursday that it has taken control of the country in a coup. Two days earlier, the military declared martial law, saying the aim was to calm tensions. What's fueling the situation in Thailand? What could happen next? And why should you be paying attention? Here's a guide to understanding the country's fast-moving crisis: . What's the latest? Details are sketchy, but Thailand's military chief announced Thursday in a national address that the armed forces had taken control of the country after rival factions were unable to reach an agreement to govern. On Tuesday, the military declared martial law without consulting the country's interim prime minister, who was serving in a caretaker status after former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra -- also a caretaker -- was ousted by Thailand's Constitutional Court. An aide to interim Prime Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan described Tuesday's move by the military as ""half a coup d'etat."" There's been no reaction from Niwatthamrong's camp so far. The country remains under martial law, which among other things  includes restrictions on where protesters can gather, what TV and radio broadcasters can air and social media posts, according to the Bangkok Post. Thailand wakes up to military rule: What it means . How did things get to this point? Thailand's politics have been in turmoil for years, driven in large part by a schism between populists, many of them rural and poor, and a largely urban middle class and elite in Bangkok partial to the nation's royal establishment. The current disruption has its roots in the 2006 military ouster of billionaire Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who built a strong political base with populist policies that appealed to rural villagers in Thailand's north. Thaksin's removal led to a broad-based opposition movement that came to a head with widespread demonstrations in parts of Bangkok in 2010. The military violently suppressed the protests, resulting in some 90 deaths. A year later Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, rode a wave of opposition votes into power. In 2013, Yingluck proposed legislation that would have granted amnesty to Thaksin and others. The move set off a new wave of protests and anger -- this time among Bangkok's urban elites and middle class sometimes known as ""Yellow Shirts"" -- who want an end to the involvement of Thaksin's family in Thai politics for good. In May, Thailand's Constitutional Court removed Yingluck and nine Cabinet ministers from office, saying she had violated the Thai Constitution by reassigning a senior security official in 2011. Populists known as ""Red Shirts"" saw her ouster as a ""judicial coup"" and have been protesting what they consider a bias by many of the country's institutions against their side. Things escalated last week when three Yellow Shirt protesters died and 23 were injured after gunmen opened fire on a protest camp. The violence prompted an ominous warning from the army chief that troops would have to step in if the situation didn't calm down. What's next? Before the coup, the army chief, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, said the next step would be bringing ""rival parties to talk in peace."" It wasn't immediately clear if such negotiation is still on the table, or if the military has other plans. Previously, Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the military was in a precarious situation. ""They have to be evenhanded,"" he said at the time. ""If it's seen as favoring one side or the other side, then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military,"" he said. Has anything like this ever happened before in Thailand? Thailand is no stranger to military coups. Including Thursday's coup, the military has attempted 19 coups in 80 years; 12 have been successful. Before Thursday, the last one was in 2006 when the military sent tanks onto the streets before ousting Thaksin. Soldiers, selfies and martial law . Why should I care about this? Thailand's political instability could have an impact beyond the country's borders. ""Known as the 'Detroit of the East,' Thailand has risen to become a vital manufacturing and assembly hub of hard-disk drives and automobiles for Japanese and Western firms,"" the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a December analysis of the political crisis. The months of protests have already hurt Thailand's economy and run the risk of making the country less attractive to investors and governments looking to strike up deals, analysts said. ""A reputation for perpetual political unrest would definitely hurt Thailand's competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investment in the future,"" the analysis said. A recent report from the U.S. Congressional Research Service noted that ""Bangkok's reliability as a partner, and its ability to be a regional leader, are uncertain."" ""A stable Thailand is strategically important to the United States, both because of its status as a U.S. treaty ally and as an anchor for mainland Southeast Asia,"" the report said. ""U.S. policymakers are faced with how to deal with an unraveling democracy and how to respond to profound concerns about the civilian-military balance in Thai society."" This sounds familiar. How does it compare to what we've seen in other countries? Around the world, we've heard a lot about coups recently. In Libya, some troops have been arguing that increasing military power that's rallying behind a renegade local general isn't anything about which to worry. But the Libyan government and the military command in Tripoli reacted with alarm, saying that they didn't order retired Gen. Khalifa Haftar's deadly attacks against Islamist militants last week, and that the operation -- which they conceded included some Libyan soldiers -- amounted to a coup. In February, Ukraine's President claimed a coup had forced him from office, while lawmakers said they were following the will of the people when parliament voted to oust him and hold new elections. A military coup in Egypt last year ousted President Mohamed Morsy from office and placed an interim leader in power. A debate surged afterward about whether a coup was an appropriate term to use for the ouster.","Army declares coup as Thailand remains under martial law .

"(CNN) -- Virginia Tech will be fined $55,000 for waiting too long to provide timely warnings about a shooter on the loose during a 2007 rampage in which 32 people died, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday. The school said it will appeal. A December 2010 report said the school did not notify students in a ""timely manner"" -- as dictated by what is known as the Clery Act -- after a shooting that left two people dead at West Ambler Johnston residence hall on the morning of April 16, 2007. The same shooter, identified as Cho Seung-Hui, 23, went to the university's Norris Hall more than two hours later and killed 30 more people before turning a gun on himself. The Clery Act was created in 1990 in memory of 19-year-old Jeanne Ann Clery, who was raped and killed while asleep in her dorm room at Lehigh University. The law requires colleges and universities to disclose information about crimes on or near their campuses. Federal officials said the $55,000 for two violations of the act is the maximum allowed. ""While Virginia Tech's violations warrant a fine far in excess of what is currently permissible under the statute, the department's fine authority is limited,"" wrote Mary E. Gust, director of a department panel that reviewed the case. Larry Hincker, associate vice president for university relations at Virginia Tech, said Tuesday the school ""respectfully disagrees"" with the fine. ""As we noted before, neither the Department of Education nor the Clery Act defines 'timely,' "" Hincker said in a prepared statement. ""The university actions on April 16 were well within the standards and practices in effect at that time."" According to the report and Tuesday's letter to Virginia Tech, police went to the scene of the Virginia Tech dorm shooting at 7:24 a.m. At 7:57 a.m. police notified the office of the executive vice president about the shooting. President Charles W. Steger was then notified and an 8:25 a.m. meeting was held to discuss the shootings and how best to notify the campus community. The administration knew that no weapon had been found and that bloody footprints led away from the crime scene, according to the education department. But it was not until 9:26 a.m. that the university first notified students and staff by e-mail about the shooting. ""The message was vague and only notified the community there had been a shooting on campus. It did not mention that there had been a murder or that the killer had not been identified,"" the Department of Education said Tuesday. It was about 15 minutes after the e-mail went out that Cho began shooting in Norris Hall. The rampage lasted from about 9:40 a.m. to 9:51 a.m. A second message was sent to the community at 9:50 a.m. with a ""much more explicit warning."" ""Because Virginia Tech failed to notify its students and staff of the initial shootings on a timely basis, thousands continued to travel on campus, without a warning of the events at"" the residence hall, the education department said. University officials disputed the federal findings. ""We believe that Virginia Tech administrators acted appropriately in their response to the tragic events of April 16, 2007, based on the best information then available to them,"" Hincker said. The university also argued it ""is being held accountable for a new federal standard that was adopted after the April 2007 shootings."" New rules went into effect in 2008. But in its letter to Virginia Tech, the Department of Education said the school did not meet timely warning rules that were in effect on the day of the rampage. The school also is being fined for not following the warning policy it had disclosed to students and staff, the department said. CNN's Craig Bell contributed to this report .","Virginia Tech did not send timely warnings, the federal government says .

"(CNN) -- Fallout from anger over AIG's bonuses is following Sen. Chris Dodd from Washington back home to Connecticut. Sen. Chris Dodd says if he does his job, ""the politics will take care of itself."" In an example of Dodd's new uncomfortable political reality, what was supposed to be a media event to tout federal funding for emergency communications equipment for  Enfield, Connecticut's police and fire departments turned into something very different. When it came time for questions, the only questions reporters had for the Democratic senator concerned his role in the handing out of AIG bonuses. The big question is whether the Senate Banking Committee chairman's involvement will make him politically vulnerable next year when he faces re-election. At the Enfield event Friday, Dodd said that he was misled on the issue of bonuses for AIG executives. He said he would not have drafted key legislative changes allowing the bonuses to move forward if he knew the purpose of those changes. Dodd said officials at the Treasury Department led him to believe that the changes, added to the $787 billion economic stimulus bill shortly before its passage last month, were merely ""technical and innocuous"" in nature. ""If anyone had mentioned AIG or any bonuses, I would have rejected it immediately, out of hand. But the argument was this was technical,"" Dodd said. Dodd said he was disappointed that the Treasury officials who asked him to make the legislative changes had not identified themselves.  Watch why some are accusing Dodd of flip-flopping » . People are incensed over the bonuses handed out to executives at AIG and elsewhere, Dodd said. ""I don't blame them ... No one is angrier than I am."" Public outrage has exploded over $165 million worth of bonuses given out by the insurance giant at a time when the company is being bailed out with taxpayer money. Dodd told CNN on Wednesday that he was responsible for language added to the stimulus bill to make sure that existing contracts for bonuses at companies receiving federal bailout money were honored. A Treasury Department official said the Obama administration had pushed for the language. Both Dodd and the official, who asked not to be named, said administration officials worried that the government would face lawsuits without the language. Dodd initially denied that he had anything to do with the language that AIG used to justify paying out millions in bonuses. On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed legislation to try to recoup the bonuses. The measure would tax individuals on any bonuses received in 2009 from companies getting $5 billion or more in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Bonuses for people with incomes over $250,000 would be taxed at a 90 percent rate. ""In a sense I am now being blamed for having tried to do something, and accepted a technical change,"" said Dodd. ""But I'm glad I led on the issue. And I still will continue to do so. And it began last fall during the first legislation on this area. Now people are going to make what they want out of it politically,"" Dodd said. ""But I have enough faith. I've been through eight elections in this state. And people are smarter than the politicians give them credit for. And they can see through politics."" But some Democrats are worried how this will affect their long-time senator. ""I felt very sorry for him, but I feel that it probably could be the end of his political career,"" said Democrat Grace Darling, at Peppe's Pizza in New Haven. ""As a Democrat, you hate to see someone lose their seat, but I'd have to see who's running against him,"" said another patron, John Piurek. One candidate is former Republican Rep. Rob Simmons, who announced this week that he'll challenge Dodd next year. Simmons sees an opening, saying that Dodd ""failed in his oversight responsibilities. I think the papers and everybody else have got it right. It's a flip-flop."" Simmons doesn't even have a campaign office, but a Quinnipiac University poll taken before the AIG flap shows him with a 1 point lead over Dodd. ""Dodd has to be concerned because he's under 50 percent against a former congressman who's not that well-known outside of his former district,"" said Quinnipiac Polling Director Doug Schwartz. The Republican National Committee slammed Dodd Friday in a Web video that highlights the senator's  inserted language on the AIG bonuses. The RNC is also trying to cash in by sending out national fundraising solicitations. The GOP says Dodd concentrated in 2007 on running for the Democratic presidential nomination when he should have concentrated on his duties as Banking Committee chairman. Republicans mention an ethics panel investigation into discount mortgages Dodd allegedly received from Countrywide Financial Corp., a big lending company in the middle of the home foreclosure crisis. Dodd says he was unaware of the discounts. ""We intend to hold Sen. Dodd accountable for his record in what is shaping up to be an extremely competitive race in a traditionally blue state,"" said NRSC spokeswoman Amber Wilkerson. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fired back. ""Sen. Dodd is the one who has led the fight against excessive executive compensation, often over the objections of many of his Republican colleagues. ""The people of Connecticut know he's been a leader on this issue, and any attempt to make him responsible for what happened at AIG is an absurd political cheap shot that won't ring true to anyone even remotely familiar with his strong record on curbing excessive pay,"" DSCC Communications Director Eric Schultz said. ""I know I've been targeted. When you get Dick Cheney and Karl Rove and Rush Limbaugh all talking about you in the same day, it isn't coincidental. As I said, I was born at night, but not last night,"" Dodd said. He acknowledges he'd like better poll numbers, but says he thinks people will see through the political point scoring. ""I have enough confidence in them that if I do my job on their behalf, which is what they're interested in, about their jobs, their homes, their retirement, their kids' future, then the politics will take care of itself."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Mary Snow, Shirley Zilberstein, Mark Preston and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","At media event for funding announcement, reporters question Dodd about AIG .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Kulsoom Abdullah is a 35-year-old with a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering. But it's her passion outside of work that has put her at the center of a debate -- one that could affect athletic competitions worldwide, even the Olympics. Later this month, the International Weightlifting Federation will take up the question of whether Abdullah may take part in officially sanctioned tournaments while keeping her entire body covered, aside from her hands and face, in keeping with her Muslim faith. ""It's what I believe in. It's what I've chosen to do,"" Abdullah tells CNN of her decision to wear modest garb. ""I've always dressed this way publicly."" Abdullah is not an Olympic athlete, but enjoys lifting weights. She can deadlift 245 pounds (111 kg) and get up 105 pounds (47.5 kg) in the snatch, in which the competitor lifts the barbell from the floor to over her head in a single motion. She likes to compete with other women in her weight class -- she generally weighs in the 106-pound (48 kg) or 117-pound (53 kg) classifications. ""It guess it's empowering,"" she says. ""There's a lot of technique involved, so someone who's this big muscular person -- it's possible I could lift more than they do. There's speed and timing to it -- you have to be explosive. I think it's great just for confidence building ... I guess I got hooked."" The Atlanta resident wants to take part in tournaments in the United States, including one coming up in July. But USA Weightlifting informed her that those events are governed by IWF rules. And those rules preclude her dressing in keeping with her beliefs. Abdullah generally wears loose, long pants past the ankles, a long-sleeve, fitted shirt with a loose T-shirt over it, and a hijab, or head scarf, covering her hair. The outfits -- officially called ""costumes"" -- worn at competitions must be collarless and must not cover the elbows or knees, according to the IWF's technical and competition rules. The IWF constitution also states that no distinction is made among individuals based on religion. Mark Jones, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee -- which oversees USA Weightlifting and many other sports -- explained part of the challenge is that judges need to see that a competitor's elbows and knees are locked during a lift. But the USOC also understands the dilemma Abdullah faces.  After CAIR, the Council on American-Islamic Relations -- a Washington-based group that advocates for Muslims and Muslim causes -- contacted the USOC on Wednesday, Jones said, his group reached out to the IWF. ""I think their (CAIR's) language is to 'advocate' on the athlete's behalf with the international federation, and we have done that,"" Jones told CNN. ""The Olympic movement is all about the universal values of equality. We value that greatly, but we also respect the rules of sport -- especially those set forth for competitive reasons. So we're looking to see if there's some way to accommodate -- not just this one particular athlete,"" he said, adding, ""this is an issue that has some wider implications."" The International Weightlifting Federation has agreed to include the issue on the agenda of its next meeting, later this month in Malaysia, Jones said. The group's technical committee will hold a debate, and then present a recommendation to the IWF board, Jones said. ""Awesome!"" Abdullah responded, when CNN informed her Thursday of these developments. ""That's wonderful."" The news came after months of pushing for change, she said. In April, USA Weightlifting responded to an e-mail from her,  explaining that it had to reject her request due to IWF rules. In that e-mail, there was no suggestion that the group or the USOC might take up the issue with the IWF. John Duff, CEO of USA Weightlifting, issued a statement Thursday reiterating that the organization abides by the IWF rules on uniforms, and that the ""issue has been brought to the attention of the IWF and the IWF Technical Committee has agreed to place the matter on the agenda of the next meeting, which will take place on June 26 in Penang, Malaysia, for consideration."" The IWF did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. Abdullah says she understands the need to make sure she isn't wearing anything under her clothes to give her a competitive advantage. She says judges could check to make sure she is not wearing something on her elbows, for example, that might help her. And she says she's willing to wear a ""snug"" shirt -- though not skin tight -- underneath a loose singlet, so judges could ""see that there's lockout"" in her arms when she does her lifts. Ibrahim Hooper of CAIR, which sent out a news release about Abdullah on Wednesday, praised the USOC Thursday for taking action. ""It sounds like they've really done exactly what we asked them to do, which is advocate on behalf of this Muslim athlete,"" Hooper said. ""The ultimate result is a very reasonable compromise that allows the Muslim athlete to follow her religious beliefs and practices and maintain the legitimate rules and policies of Olympics and sports in general."" While Abdullah was happy to hear the IWF will consider her situation, there is no guarantee the IWF will alter its rules. Although there were no immediate, organized protests against the USOC's decision to bring Abdullah's case to the IWF, USOC spokesman Jones said his agency has received messages from people opposing any change in the rules. He did not characterize what the messages said or how many there were. Numerous athletic agencies have faced similar questions in the past and, in some cases, have determined that allowing special clothing violates fairness or equality among all contestants. FIFA, the international federation governing soccer, recently refused to allow Iran's women's soccer team to wear headscarves while playing in an Olympic qualifying round in Amman, Jordan. Abdullah told CNN her effort is not just about herself. ""I should at least try,"" she said, ""if not for me then maybe for other women who -- if they have my faith or another faith -- dress a certain way.""","Kulsoom Abdullah wants to keep her body covered during official competitions .

"On the same day the United States announced the arrest of a 19-year old attempting to leave the country to join ISIS, a top State Department official said the American efforts to combat ISIS' powerful online message are working. The anti-ISIS messaging campaign is keeping disaffected youth from joining the extremist group, Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel told CNN's Elise Labott on Monday. ""We have evidence that there are young people who are not joining because we have somehow interceded,"" Stengel said. ""They're reading the messages, they're hearing the messages -- not just from us but from the hundreds of Islamic clerics who have said that this is a perversion of Islam, from the hundreds of Islamic scholars who have said the same thing."" ""It's a very small cohort,"" Stengel said of the so-called ""foreign fighter"" cases originating from the United States. As part of his role at the State Department, Stengel overseas the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which aims to counter propaganda from ISIS. ISIS has been effective over the past several months at bringing its message to young people around the world through a series of highly produced and graphically violent videos, and through online forums. ""We're out there contesting that space,"" said Stengel, ""and I think we're doing well there."" Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? Stengel recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, during which he met with officials from U.S. regional coalition partners in the fight against ISIS. During his interview with CNN, Stengel weighed in on controversy surrounding comments made last week by Vice President Joe Biden, which seemed to call into question the commitment of some of those same key partners. Stengel said the uproar over Biden's remarks, which he later apologized for, is a ""peripheral issue."" ""I don't think that deters anybody at all,"" Stengel added, ""and in fact I think they regard it as a very minor distraction compared to this real challenge of mobilizing all of our collective forces against this abhorrent organization.""","Anti-ISIS messaging campaign is working, State Department official says .

"A celestial fireworks show peaks Monday and Tuesday as Earth passes though the dust of a comet's tail. Humans around the world have witnessed the Perseid meteor shower every August for at least 2,000 years, with dozens of meteors streaking across the sky each hour. Your view is best after midnight until just before sunrise. Get away from city lights, if possible, for the full effect.  A waning crescent moon means less light in the sky to compete with the meteor display.  Next year's show will be dimmed by a full moon. The annual sky spectacular happens when our planet's orbit around the sun passes near Comet Swift-Tuttle's path, which goes by every 130 years.  The last close encounter with the comet was 20 years ago, but it left grains of dust in its wake. The bright streaks you see are ""interplanetary dust"" burning up as it collides with our atmosphere at about 133,000 mph, according to NASA micrometeoroid expert Diego Janches.  ""The fragments are either remnants from the solar system's formation, or they are produced by collisions between asteroids or comets from long ago."" ""Each such fragment is approximately the size of a dime, but the more constant, sporadic meteoroids have been around much longer, breaking down over time into tiny fragments only about as wide as a piece of human hair,"" according to NASA.gov. While the meteor show is entertainment for most, it is a research opportunity for Janches and other NASA scientists.  They'll use radar systems around the globe to watch the fragments of sodium, silicon, calcium and magnesium enter the atmosphere. ""The small meteoroids feed the atmosphere with all these extra materials,"" Janches said in a NASA.com posting. ""They come in, release metallic atoms that get deposited in the mesosphere and then get pushed around from pole to pole by the general global circulation. So by using the metals as tracers, you can answer some important questions about the general composition and movement of the atmosphere.""","The best view of the Perseid meteor shower is after midnight until just before sunrise .

"(CNN) -- Two people charged in a staged Texas bank heist apparently didn't think twice when they typed messages in the ""What's on your mind?"" portion of their Facebook pages, court documents show. ""Get $$$(;.,"" wrote bank employee Estefany Danelia Martinez, 19, two days before $62,201 was taken from the International Bank of Commerce in Houston, according to an affidavit from FBI Special Agent Kevin J. Katz. According to the affidavit, filed with a criminal complaint in federal court this week, her boyfriend, Ricky Gonzalez, 18, wrote on his page on March 24, the day after the robbery, ""Wipe my teeth with hundereds (sic)."" Those postings, plus an anonymous Crime Stoppers tip on March 30, landed the pair and two others in custody, according to the federal complaint. The tip advised there was information about the heist on Facebook. Martinez's attorney said Friday the Facebook postings may show his client was immature and deserving of a short prison term or probation. According to the Katz's affidavit, Martinez told authorities the amateurish scheme was hatched by another teller, Anna Margarita Rivera. Rivera was a teller during a previous unsolved bank robbery ""and believed staging the robbery would be easy,"" according to the affidavit. ""Martinez advised the plan was for herself and Rivera to pick a date where they would both be working the late shift and they would plan for the staged robbery to take place close to closing time, thus minimizing the chances of any customers being in the bank,"" according to the affidavit. Gonzalez and Arturo Solano, Rivera's brother, were recruited, authorities said. Bank surveillance video showed two masked and armed men entering the bank around 5:45 p.m. on March 23. They jumped over the counter and demanded money. One of the pistols later was determined to be fake. One robber took money and the other ordered the tellers to place money from the vault in a bag, the FBI agent said. The tellers, the only people in the bank at the time of the robbery, remained in the vault and later called 911. On March 24, Gonzalez wrote on his Facebook page, ""U have to past the line sometimes!! To get dis money,"" the complaint says. Martinez allegedly wrote, ""I'm rich"" on Gonzalez's page on March 25. Lance Hamm, an attorney for Gonzalez, told CNN that his client was not referring to the bank robbery in his Facebook posts. ""I don't feel the Facebook thing is as relevant as everyone is making it to be,"" Hamm said. ""I think it was just young kids talking,"" said Hamm, adding Gonzalez, who could face 10 years in prison, has been ""upfront"" with investigators. ""He knew he was in over his head."" Hamm said the incident was more akin to an employee theft. Gonzales was not a mastermind and his role ""should be mitigated"" in any prosecution, the lawyer said. Richard Kuniansky, who represents Martinez, said the single mother has never been in trouble and likely will enter a plea, arguing her age and maturity should be factors in sentencing. ""They were young and immature and didn't appreciate the seriousness,"" he said. CNN also left a message Friday with Rivera's lawyer. An attorney for Solano was not listed in court documents. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Client didn't appreciate seriousness of crime, attorney says .

"During the world championships in Moscow last month, sprint king Usain Bolt was asked how long he intended to keep running. He kept reporters guessing and some thought he wouldn't last until the next Olympics. But on Wednesday Bolt said that he would call it quits after racing at the 2016 Summer Games in Brazil. ""So far it's after the Olympics in Rio,"" the 27-year-old told reporters in Brussels, where he is competing Friday. ""If I'm in great shape and I go there and do what I have to do, I think it would be a good time to retire on top and having dominated for so long."" The Jamaican admitted he struggled with his motivation this year and it is little wonder given he has regularly coasted to 100- and 200-meter victories at the Olympics and world championships. ""I couldn't find that goal, that drive to get going again,"" Bolt said. ""I sat down and thought to myself -- what do I really want? And what can I do in this sport some more?"" Including relays, Bolt owns a combined 14 gold medals in the sport's two biggest events and is the world record-holder in both the 100 and 200 meters. In order to ensure his place in the pantheon of sporting legends, Bolt said he needs to go out on a high in Rio -- and hopes his powerful body cooperates. ""I've made up my mind that if I want to be among the greats of Ali, Pele and all these guys I have to continue dominating until I retire,"" he added. ""I'm really focusing on getting every season correct, trying not to get injured and just continue dominating so at the end of my career people will put me among the greats."" His accomplishments to date already make him one of the best athletes of all time. Not the shy type, Bolt called himself a ""legend"" after achieving another individual sprint double at the 2012 London Olympics. No one came close to challenging him in Russia. His only misstep since rising to the top took place at the 2011 world championships in South Korea when he false started and was disqualified from the 100-meter final. And in a sport hit hard recently by positive drug tests to sprinters Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell and Veronica Campbell -- the latter two are fellow Jamaicans -- Bolt has never tested positive, always maintaining that he is clean. With a personality larger than his 6-foot-5-inch frame, Bolt is especially popular among fans and sponsors alike. Forbes this year named him the 40th highest-paid athlete in the world with earnings of $24.2 million. He features in commercials for Virgin and is also backed by Puma, Samsung and Nissan, among others.","Sprint king Usain Bolt says he will retire after the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .

"It's fairly clear the federal investigation into Penn State University won't be a duplication of the grand jury probe that led to charges of more than 50 counts of child sex abuse against Jerry Sandusky. Instead, federal authorities seem to be stepping into areas where the state attorney general's office hasn't gone. This time, they seem to be exploring the possibility of a cover-up at Penn State, as well as possible bribes, fraud, or misuse of federal money, according to three former federal prosecutors asked to independently review the subpoena Penn State received February  2. And on the case is one of the most experienced and respected assistant U.S. attorneys in the region, Gordon Zubrod. The subpoena asks for: . -- payments made by university board members to third parties. -- records of complaints, interviews or out-of-court settlements regarding Sandusky, a former coach at the university. -- computer hard drives. -- correspondence with Sandusky's children's charity, The Second Mile. ""If you thought there might be a cover-up, these are the type of documents you might want to get to know, one way or another,"" said Laurie Levinson, a former assistant U.S. attorney and current professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ""The subpoena appears to be exploring when or whether there was any institutional awareness of Sandusky's alleged conduct at Penn State,"" said James W. Spertus, a Los Angeles lawyer and former federal prosecutor. ""If, for example, there were private efforts by board members to settle claims before the matter became public, or there were reports to the board about the allegations, it could change the nature of the investigation."" Already, state prosecutors have charged two former Penn State officials with not doing enough when a report was brought to them in 2002 by an assistant football coach who said he'd allegedly witnessed something inappropriate in a locker room shower on campus. The moral obligations of others have been questioned. But those charges involve inaction, rather than an overt cover-up. This federal investigation appears to be going deeper. ""At this point, they don't have to have proof, just a theory,"" said Bruce E. Reinhart, another former federal prosecutor now in private law practice. ""They're trying to prove or disprove the theory."" While Gov. Tom Corbett said in two recent television interviews that The Second Mile isn't under investigation by the state — although his staff says he was speaking in past tense and meant ""wasn't"" — the federal subpoena is specifically looking at issues related to the charity where it's alleged Sandusky met almost all of his 10 accusers. Lanny Davis, the high-profile Washington lawyer hired to represent Penn State in the wake of the Sandusky scandal, declined to comment on where the investigation might be going. ""We don't speculate on what prosecutors might be interested in, we just cooperate,"" Davis said. Each year, educational institutions such as Penn State receive million of dollars in federal money earmarked for certain areas such as defense or medical research and educational programs. If that money was used for other purposes, that could be a federal crime, Reinhart said. ""I'm sure they get all sorts of federal funding that flows into large state university's like that,"" he said. ""As part of that sort of grant or funding, you have to certify those funds will only be used for the certain things. That could be why they'd be looking into interactions with Second Mile and Penn State."" Fraud could be a possibility if false statements were made to an agency such as the NCAA, Reinhart said. Something like, ""We don't have any unauthorized persons using the training facilities."" Penn State has said that, as part of his retirement agreement, Sandusky kept an office and a key to the Penn State locker room. Sandusky left his coaching job as Paterno's defensive coordinator after the 1999 season. He was asked, after the 2002 incident, not to bring children with him to the facilities, but university officials testified before a grand jury that the ban was unenforceable. If Penn State didn't disclose that to an agency who asked for such information, that could constitute fraud. ""The NCAA might say, 'We would never have allowed them to go to a bowl ... or get certain funding,'""  Reinhart said. There's also the possibility of hush money. ""If they somehow diverted funds to keep victims, or others in the know quiet,"" Reinhart said, ""they might be trying to figure out if that happened. ... That would explain why they'd ask if trustees have ever made payments on behalf of university."" All these things requested in the subpoenas — e-mails, complaints, payments — all point to an investigation that might have little to do with the alleged victims, Levinson said. ""That looks much more like the back end — how did the university react to what Sandusky had (allegedly) done?"" she said. ""Not investigating what Sandusky had done. ... This is more about the university and The Second Mile."" When contacted, several people close to the alleged victims named in the state grand jury presentments against Sandusky said they had not been contacted or interviewed by federal investigators. Those close to the defense for former athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz — both charged with failing to report the 2002 incident, then lying to a state grand jury about it  — said the pair has not been subpoenaed. Sandusky's attorney had no direct knowledge of the probe. The Second Mile charity and a lawyer for the late head coach Joe Paterno received requests for documents and are cooperating without a subpoena, sources say. At this stage of the investigation, however, that's not unusual, the experts said. ""This is definitely the first step,"" Levinson said. ""The first thing that happens is the prosecution sends out a subpoena for all the documents they can find and then start in on key witnesses."" The state grand jury continues to meet on the Sandusky case, a spokesman for the attorney general's office said, even after two presentments have led to multiple charges against Sandusky. Because grand juries meet in secret, prosecutors can't talk about what topics they are exploring. However, Corbett said publicly there is no indication The Second Mile is under investigation. He also publicly defended his decision to accept more than $25,000 in campaign donations from current members of The Second Mile board while running for governor. That number balloons to $200,000 when former members are included. Corbett also received about $38,000 directly from current members of the Penn State board of trustees.","Former prosecutors review subpoena sent to Penn State .

"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's trip to Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia underscores that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remains the cornerstone of Japan's Asian diplomacy. Before cutting his trip short to deal with the kidnapping of Japanese nationals in Algeria, Abe commented, ""Open seas are public assets and Japan will do utmost to protect them by cooperating with ASEAN. China's economic rise is definitely a plus for Japan but it is important for China to act responsibly as part of international society."" Coming amid an escalating territorial dispute with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, it appears that Abe's diplomacy aims to strengthen Japan's hand vis-a-vis China. Ironically, during his last visit to the region back when he was previously premier in 2007, Abe promoted an Arc of Freedom and Prosperity. At that time the reaction to this values-based initiative aimed at containing China was lukewarm. Now China's muscle flexing in the region has everyone worried. Beijing's growing assertiveness in territorial disputes has raised tensions and left China diplomatically isolated. While everyone is concerned about Abe's revisionist views concerning Japan's wartime history, especially his caviling about the ""comfort women,"" there is widespread appreciation in the region for Japan's post-WWII contributions to peace and development. ASEAN has no concerns that Japan represents a threat to regional stability, but the same cannot be said for China. Abe is on a mission to reinvigorate the Japanese economy, win control of the upper house of the Diet (National Assembly) in summer elections and push through constitutional revision to remove constraints on Japan's military. Hounded from office in 2007 because of his poor political skills and failures to address voters' economic anxieties, Abe II seeks redemption and has hit the ground running. He has publicly pressured the Bank of Japan to adopt unlimited monetary easing and a 2% inflation target, unveiled a $117 billion fiscal stimulus package, sent his finance and foreign ministers on key diplomatic missions to Southeast Asia and Australia, and dispatched an envoy to South Korea to reach out to new President Park Gyeun-hye. This flurry of diplomatic activity is driven by economic and security concerns. Japanese companies are investing heavily in the growth prospects of Southeast Asia. Japan is a leading economic partner overall and Abe seeks to reassure its partners, and voters at home, that Japan will remain a major global player. When the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) took over in 2009, PM Yukio Hatoyama promoted warmer ties with Beijing, but that strategy has not exactly worked out. Chinese maritime and aerial probing in the disputed territory in the East China Sea has escalated security concerns and also damaged economic relations. It has been assumed that economic relations would continue to prosper despite chilly political relations, but that calculus no longer holds. Japanese business has played a key role in China's rapid rise, and will continue to do so, but on a lesser scale as the mood has soured dramatically. ASEAN's GDP is less than a third the size of China, but the region is resource-rich, has a lot of untapped growth potential and represents a good hedge against political risk in China. Much has been made of the Obama strategic pivot to Asia involving the reallocation of U.S. security assets to a region where Washington sees the greatest economic opportunities and security risks. While the U.S. was distracted by wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there was a perception of policy drift towards the Asia-Pacific, leaving China to expand its influence. The Obama Administration talks about cooperation with Beijing on key issues, but seems to have settled into a ""contain and isolate"" mode. Abe is also pivoting. He has called for a $1 billion (2.6%) increase in defense spending and will build six new Coast Guard patrol vessels. He also included significant security-related logistical support in his fiscal stimulus package, is shifting security assets to Okinawa in southwestern Japan and is establishing a Coast Guard patrol group that will focus on monitoring Chinese probing in the disputed territory. Abe also seeks to modify defense guidelines to facilitate expanded security cooperation with the U.S. Part two of the Abe pivot is expected following the Upper House elections. If the LDP succeeds in winning it will hold the reins in both houses of the Diet, creating an opportunity for him to push through his longstanding agenda of removing constitutional constraints on the military. While this will prove controversial at home, and in a region where memories of Japan's wartime excesses still resonate, Washington welcomes the prospect of enhanced burden sharing. China's decade of smile diplomacy -- aimed at reassuring the region that a rising China is not a threat -- has imploded and its feistiness has only increased its diplomatic isolation. Equally, Japan's rightward political shift and the Abe pivot could backfire, alienating the region while stoking tensions. The current test of wills and ratcheting up the saber rattling is a dangerous dead-end. Quiet diplomacy and a cooling off period leading Beijing and Tokyo to hand each other a ladder to climb down might prove more helpful in averting some grave miscalculation over the divisive islets. Renunciation of military solutions after all, is a cornerstone of Japan's post-WWII success and high esteem in the region.","Kingston:  It appears that Abe's diplomacy aims to strengthen Japan's hand vis-a-vis China .

"We're not bluffing, the Obama administration told Afghanistan on Tuesday in announcing for the first time it has started planning for the possible withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of the year if no security agreement is signed. Statements by the White House and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel showed President Barack Obama's impatience with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign the agreement that would keep several thousand American troops in the country after combat operations conclude this year. In a phone call with Karzai on Tuesday to discuss upcoming elections for a new Afghan leader, Obama made clear that time was running out to properly plan for keeping any U.S. forces in the country beyond 2014, the White House said. Meanwhile, a senior Pakistani official warned that pulling out U.S. troops could have dire consequences, leading to a civil war in Afghanistan. Obama calling . ""President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014,"" said the White House statement. It also noted that a deal remained possible with a new Afghan leader, even if Karzai fails to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement before the April election chooses his successor. History not repeating itself in Afghanistan . ""Should we have a BSA and a willing and committed partner in the Afghan government, a limited post-2014 mission focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces and going after the remnants of core al Qaeda could be in the interests of the United States and Afghanistan,"" the White House said. ""Therefore, we will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year."" In his separate statement, Hagel said he strongly supported the order by Obama to ""ensure adequate plans are in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014."" Speaking at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia Tuesday afternoon, Hagel said the situation in Afghanistan will likely be a top item on the agenda at a NATO ministerial conference in Brussels this week. Obama, he said, has been very clear that the possibility of U.S. troops staying in Afghanistan depends ""on whether we have a bilateral security agreement signed by the Afghani government, to assure our rights of our troops and other important elements that are required any time America has troops in another country."" Pakistani official: Don't do it . A senior Pakistani government official told CNN that a full withdrawal of U.S. troops should not be considered, declaring that ""the zero option means civil war in Afghanistan."" Speaking on condition of not being identified, the Pakistani official predicted that 30% of Afghan forces would desert if U.S. forces leave the country. For the Pentagon, Obama's order means preparing for all contingencies. ""For the first time, the commander in chief has told us to begin planning for a complete withdrawal"" from Afghanistan, a senior U.S. official told CNN. While the option to keep troops there remains, the situation has reached a point where the Pentagon has to begin planning for all possibilities, the official added. More than 33,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan as the Obama administration winds down the almost 13-year war that began shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The security agreement negotiated between Afghanistan and the United States would cover a continuing mission after 2014 focused on training Afghan forces and counterterrorism. Pentagon: If freed Afghan prisoners return to fight, they're 'legitimate targets' Afghan presidential contender says he'll sign if elected . While Karzai has balked at signing, a leading contender to succeed him told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this month that the agreement should proceed. Presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah said he would sign the deal to keep international forces in Afghanistan, and aid dollars flowing, if elected in April. Abdullah said Afghanistan will need the financial and military support of the international community ""for years to come."" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that that longer it takes for security agreement to get signed, the more difficult it will be to properly plan and carry out a U.S. mission after 2014. Continued delay would result in a smaller and less ambitious mission, Carney said. Asked what happens if no agreement gets signed, he said: ""We cannot and will not have U.S. troops on the ground"" without a signed deal. Karzai's not-so-crazy end game .

"Followers of the Paleo Diet may go prehistoric on U.S. News & World Report this week. The publication has ranked the controversial diet last on its ""Best Diets Overall"" list for 2014. Each year, U.S. News & World Report asks experts to rank various nutrition plans to help consumers make informed decisions. This year the panel evaluated 32 of the most popular diets. To be top-rated, a diet has to be relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease. First popularized in the 1970s, the Paleo Diet asks people to follow a diet similar to those who lived during the Paleolithic era, between 2.6 million and 10,000 years ago. This means eating like hunters and gathers -- consuming lots of produce and animal protein, while avoiding sugar, grains, legumes and dairy altogether. ""If the cavemen didn't eat it, you shouldn't either,"" U.S. News & World Report summarized. The diet has gained a significant following in recent years, especially among the CrossFit crowd. ""Paleo Diet"" was the most searched diet term on Google in 2013. Being last on the Best Diets list doesn't mean Paleo is the worst diet ever (the ""Cookie Diet"" didn't even make the list). But U.S. News & World Report's experts said the Paleo Diet was too restrictive for most people to follow long term, and that it limited some essential nutrients. They also cited a lack of research proving the Paleo Diet's cardiovascular health and weight loss benefits in their ranking. The Paleo Diet tied for last place on the list alongside the Dukan diet, which is also a high-protein, low-carbohydrate approach. For the fourth year in a row, the DASH Diet Eating Plan was named the best overall diet. DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, was developed by the National Institutes of Health for people with high blood pressure. But it is also effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing a person's risk for heart disease, stroke, kidney stones and diabetes, its website states. Unlike many diet plans, DASH doesn't cut out or extremely restrict certain foods. Its focus is on limiting daily sodium intake. The meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes. The diet's only downfalls, the expert panel said, are that it takes some ""grunt work"" to adhere to, and that it may cost more than a diet based on ""processed, fatty, sugary foods."" Following DASH on the best overall list was the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes Diet, which also was created by the National Institutes of Health. Next in line were the Mayo Clinic Diet, the Mediterranean Diet and Weight Watchers -- all tied for third place. This is the same as last year's ranking. U.S. News & World Report also published several other lists, including best weight-loss diets, best diabetes diets, best commercial diet plans and easiest diets to follow. Weight Watchers topped the best weight-loss, best commercial diet plan and easiest to follow lists. Also high on several lists were the Jenny Craig plan and ""The Biggest Loser"" plan.

"The U.S. government is conducting a review of how it responds when American citizens are taken hostage by overseas terrorists, including how the families of captives are kept informed, CNN learned Monday. A top Pentagon official wrote in a letter to Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, that President Barack Obama had ordered a ""comprehensive review of the U.S. Government policy on overseas terrorist-related hostage cases, with specific emphasis on examining family engagement, intelligence collection and diplomatic engagement policies."" Hunter has advocated for a tougher U.S. response when Americans are taken captive overseas. The Obama administration response was first reported Monday by The Daily Beast. The Pentagon official who wrote Hunter, Under Secretary of Defense Christine Wormuth, said the review came as a result of ""the increased frequency of hostage-taking of Americans overseas"" and would seek to add ""innovative and non-traditional solutions"" to hostage-recovery efforts. In a statement, the White House said Obama had ordered the review over the summer. ""President Obama directed relevant departments and agencies, including the Departments of Defense and State, the FBI, and the Intelligence Community, to conduct a comprehensive review of how the U.S. government addresses these matters,"" Alistar Baskey, a National Security Council spokesman wrote. ""While we are not in a position to detail every effort or every tool we are using to try to bring American hostages home, we will continue to bring all appropriate military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic capabilities to bear to recover American hostages,"" Baskey said. ""Those efforts continue every day."" On Sunday, ISIS released a fifth video showing the brutal execution of a Westerner, in this case, American aid worker Peter Kassig. Two other Americans have been shown in previous videos being beheaded by ISIS: James Foley and Steven Sotloff, both journalists. After Foley's death in August, the United States said it had attempted to rescue him and other hostages in a military operation over the summer but couldn't find where they were being held. Foley's mother later told CNN she was ""embarrassed and appalled"" by how the U.S. government had responded to her son's case. ""I think our efforts to get Jim freed were an annoyance"" to the U.S. government, Diane Foley said on CNN in the weeks following James Foley's death. She said the U.S. government should be more willing to negotiate with ISIS in order to free hostages. Other governments, particularly in Europe, have successfully won the release of captives by paying ransoms to ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Obama and other U.S. officials have decried the practice, saying the money has fueled the group's rise.

"When word started spreading last week that Saudi women -- already some of the most oppressed and restricted in the world -- were being monitored electronically as they left the country, activists were quick to express their outrage. ""It's very shameful,"" said Manal Al-Sharif, who became an icon of female empowerment in 2011 after defying the conservative kingdom's driving ban and encouraging other Saudi women to do the same. Al-Sharif was one of the first prominent Saudis to start tweeting about the electronic monitoring issue -- describing the shock experienced by a couple she knew after the husband received a text message alerting him his wife had left Saudi Arabia, even though they were traveling out of the country together. What surprised and disturbed them most, Al-Sharif told CNN, was the fact that the husband had not registered with the Interior Ministry to begin receiving such notifications. ""It shows how women are still being treated as minors,"" added Al-Sharif. She went on to explain how, even though a notification system has actually been in place since 2010, before last week, a male guardian would have had to specifically request the service from the country's Interior Ministry before receiving such messages. In recent years, much has been made of the fact that Saudi Arabia is the sole remaining country in which women still have not been given the right to drive. But restrictions experienced by Saudi females extend to far more than just getting behind the wheel. In the deeply conservative kingdom, a woman is not allowed to go to school, get a job, or even travel outside the country without first obtaining the permission of her male ""guardian,"" or mahram. Paris Hilton causes dust-up in Mecca . In Saudi Arabia, every woman has a male guardian -- traditionally her father, husband or brother. But the country's guardianship system doesn't just apply to women -- underage children, as well as foreign workers, also must be granted permission before being allowed outside the country's borders. In the past few years, the country's Interior Ministry has been introducing ""e-government"" initiatives to simplify tracking of dependents with technology and to make it easier for guardians to allow their dependents to leave the country. One such program was introduced in 2010 -- guardians could sign up for a service that would notify them electronically once any of their dependents, be they, wives, children or workers, had left the country. The information would be sent out once any of these dependents had their passports scanned and crossed any of the country's borders. It was only over the course of the last week, however, that text messages started getting sent even to men who hadn't signed up for this service. Opinion: Fairness needed for U.S. pregnant workers . Eman Al Nafjan, a Saudi writer and blogger, told CNN that the electronic monitoring controversy is a complicated issue that has been somewhat misunderstood -- that this is simply the latest iteration of an antiquated guardianship system Saudi women have had to live with for far too long. ""Why is it being technologically implemented and being updated?"" asked Al Nafjan.  ""Why is it not being phased out? That's the real question."" And it's a question that's been asked more and more in the last several years by activists who say Saudi Arabia's strict guardianship laws only serve to infantilize women and strip them of any freedoms. For Al Nafjan, the electronic monitoring is a serious matter, but one that has overshadowed something far more important: . ""This (male guardianship) system enables exploitation of women -- it's government-sanctioned exploitation,"" said Al Nafjan, adding how Saudi laws enable men to exert complete control over their female dependents. ""It's a power that's being used over women,"" explained Al Nafjan, who strongly advocates ending the guardianship system. ""Women are not free. No matter how old you are, you're always a minor. It's almost like slavery. Guardianship is practically ownership."" Al-Sharif, for her part, wondered why there aren't e-government services in place in Saudi Arabia to assist women who are in trouble, ""to help women go file complaints against their abusers if their actual guardians won't go with them."" ""Women should use this to make some noise,"" added Al-Sharif, ""rock the boat, and say enough is enough.""","In Saudi Arabia, every women of any age has a male ""guardian""
The government set up an electronic monitoring program in 2010 for women's travel abroad .
The guardian could request to be notified if his dependent left the country .
But now, men are being notified -- even if they never asked for the information ."
"Ellen DeGeneres, #Busted. The Academy Award host broke Twitter with her Oscar-night group selfie using a mobile phone built by Samsung, a major sponsor of Hollywood's big night. It generated a record 2.7 million retweets -- a coup for her, the Oscars telecast and the Korean electronics maker. But some sharp-eyed observers noticed something a bit different when viewing the talk-show host's backstage tweets. Several of them, such as a photo of DeGeneres with actor Channing Tatum, were sent not from a Samsung Galaxy handset but a rival iPhone. The source of the photos and tweets can't be seen on DeGeneres' Twitter page, but is visible when they're viewed on another platform such as TweetDeck. Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN. Several other photos DeGeneres posted were sent using an Android device, most likely the Samsung phone she used to pose with Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt and a handful of other A-list stars. A similar faux pas occurred in 2012, when after weeks of talking up Microsoft's Surface tablet, talk-show queen Oprah Winfrey sent a Twitter message touting the product to her 14.8 million followers. However, Winfrey -- or whoever managed her Twitter account -- sent the tweet from an iPad. Some bloggers came to her defense, noting that no official Twitter app existed for the Surface's operating system at the time. And singer Alicia Keys claimed she was hacked after she was caught tweeting from an iPhone last year while serving as a ""creative director"" for BlackBerry.","Ellen DeGeneres tweeted pics via phone from Oscars sponsor Samsung .

"He has been declared America's ""first gay president."" But President Barack Obama's evolution to that title hasn't been easy. His positions zig-zagged over almost two decades. His advocacy of same-sex marriage began well before his White House years, tracing back to his early political service in Illinois. The effectiveness of his leadership, however, will be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court as it considers a California ban on same-sex marriage. 1996: While running for the Illinois Senate, Obama signs a questionnaire for a gay Chicago publication saying he favors legalizing same-sex marriages. He later wins the race. 1998: He alters course and answers ""undecided"" on same-sex marriage when questioned in another survey. 2003: In his campaign for the Illinois Senate, Obama says in a questionnaire that he is against repealing the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 federal law that states for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. 2004: When running for the U.S. Senate, he notes he is ""a Christian"" and that ""marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman."" He wins the race. The new Obama has his heart on his sleeve . 2009: Obama signs a memorandum granting some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. February 2011: The Obama administration instructs the U.S. Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of  the Defense of Marriage Act in court. June 2011: White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer says President Obama's 1996 questionnaire was ""actually filled out by someone else, not the president."" Obama ""has been against"" same-sex marriage, but his and the country's position was evolving on the matter, Pfeiffer says. ""I can't tell you when that evolution will continue."" 2012:  Obama endorses same-sex marriage, the first such statement by a sitting president. The legal decision should be up to the states to determine, he says. January 2013: Obama becomes the first U.S. president to mention gays and lesbians in an inaugural address and champions same-sex marriage. March 2013: Obama personally reviews and OKs his administration's amicus or ""friend of the court"" brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court as it weighs the constitutionality of California's 2008 Proposition 8 referendum banning same-sex marriage. 2013-2017: Will Obama's next evolutionary step seek change in the 41 states that currently define marriage as between one man and one woman?

"Two days after an international pact was brokered with the stated goal of easing tensions in Ukraine, the major players met again in Kiev to hash out plans to push it along. While there was little indication of what, if any, progress was made Saturday in defusing tensions, all sides agreed to allow a 57-nation organization with a history of stepping in to mediate crises to moderate talks. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said in a statement it planned to send its deputy chief monitor to eastern Ukraine to help implement an international pact reached among Russia, Ukraine and its Western allies in Geneva earlier this week. ""In this regard the meeting's participants recognized the need to take immediate concrete steps towards de-escalation,"" according to the OSCE statement. The OSCE says the Ukrainian government has already taken steps to do this. OSCE also said the participants in Saturday's meeting in Kiev also agreed ""to meet regularly"" as they work to resolve the continuing unrest in some eastern Ukrainian cities. Donetsk separatists stand their ground . Meanwhile, Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine did not agree to the Geneva Statement, and in defiance of the international deal, have dug in their heels. But they have not seized any new buildings or infrastructure sites since the deal was signed. However, in Donetsk and other cities, they have refused to leave the buildings they do occupy or to lay down their arms. A key element of the Geneva pact calls for them to vacate the buildings and disarm in exchange for amnesty. The separatists' self-declared leader, Denis Pushilin, who leads a group called the Donetsk People's Republic, says the separatists did not sign the deal. Pushilin said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who signed the deal, was not acting on his behalf. ""He signed on behalf of the Russian Federation."" Pushilin has called for a referendum by May 11 on the separation of eastern Ukraine from the country as a whole. Such a move could prove popular among Ukrainians who view the country's interim authorities as illegitimate. The current government took power in February after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Putin says Russia won't back down under threat of U.S. sanctions . The Geneva Statement has not stopped the war of words between Russia and Western powers. The U.S. has accused Russia of fomenting instability in Ukraine and has imposed sanctions on some Russian officials. The West has repeatedly called on Russia to withdraw some 40,000 troops that NATO says it has massed near Ukraine's border. Moscow insists they are there for military exercises. In an interview posted on Russia's state-owned Rossiya 1 website, President Vladimir Putin said he won't give in to Western demands. But on Saturday Putin said he saw no reason why relations between East and West shouldn't return to normal, according to state news agency ITAR-Tass. ""This does not depend on us. Or not on us only. This depends on our counterparts,"" he is quoted as saying. ""I believe there is nothing preventing (the) improvement of relations and ... normal cooperation."" U.S. military exercises in eastern Europe . The diplomatic back-and-forth came amid word from a Western official that U.S. troops will take part in military exercises Eastern Europe. The official, with direct knowledge of the plan, said the exercises will take place in coming weeks in Poland and Estonia. Both countries are U.S. allies and share a border with Russia. Officials in Poland and Estonia have both expressed concern over recent Russian military movements and actions in and around Ukraine. Putin aims to reward Russian troops for Crimea . The Russian government has plans to reward the nation's troops who took part in the annexation of Crimea last month. Putin announced those intentions during an interview that aired on Russian state TV Saturday. ""I don't think we will know (those who participated in that mission) in the near future, but government awards will certainly follow.""","Little progress in a meeting in Kiev Saturday to ease tensions in eastern Ukraine .

"Mudslides, cold, flooding. The barrage of extreme weather feels relentless. Another arctic blast is bringing subzero temperatures to the Midwest, pushing the mercury below freezing as far south as Florida. Detroit public schools will be closed Friday because of extreme cold, the school system said. The National Weather Service warned that in the Detroit area, wind chills are forecast to be between 10 and 25 degrees below zero. Forecasters say Detroit is the hardest-hit this season, with more than 78 inches of snow and 13 days of temperatures below zero. New York, Philadelphia and Chicago also rank high on the misery list for record snowfall and freezing temps. ""We've been able to look at this winter and compare it to the record since 1950, and putting this winter in context, it really has been as severe as people think it is,"" said Barbara Mayes Boustead, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. ""This really has been the worst winter in a lot of people's lifetimes. We haven't seen winters like this since the 70s in a lot of places."" News of more extreme weather got a cold response. ""Where the hell is that stupid groundhog? I'm going to wring its scrawny little neck,"" said Christopher Klipstine of Hobbs, New Mexico. Famed groundhog weather prognosticator Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow earlier this month, predicting six more weeks of winter. Rain brings relief, and mudslides . Thousands of miles away from Detroit, some areas in Southern California are evacuating because of the potential for flash floods Friday and Saturday in Los Angeles County. Authorities are warning that torrential rain will finally put a dent in the state's severe drought -- its worst in 100 years -- but at a price. Currently, California is ""abnormally dry,"" the U.S. Department of Agriculture said last week. Though rain will bring much-needed relief, mudslides are a big concern, with 6 inches of rain forecast for some areas. ""A very strong and dynamic storm will bring a significant amount of rain to much of southwestern California,"" the National Weather Service said. ""A flash flood watch has been issued for several recent burn areas in Los Angeles County due to the abundant rainfall expected,"" the weather service said. ""There will be isolated thunderstorms ... rain rates at times are expected to range from a half to 1 inch per hour, which could cause significant mud and debris flows."" A flash flood watch remains in effect until Saturday evening for Colby, Madison and Madre burn areas in Los Angeles County. Most of those areas are at risk because recent wildfires have razed vegetation and left hillsides bare. Affected areas under mandatory evacuation orders include Azusa and Glendora, which have the highest risk of flooding due to loss of vegetation.","Detroit public schools will be closed Friday because of extreme cold .

"It's for just one congressional seat for about eight months, but Tuesday's special election in Florida has taken on huge political significance. National Republicans are framing Tuesday's special election as a referendum on Obamacare. But their message -- plus a flood of outside spending by Democrats focused on the issue of Social Security -- is drowning out other issues in the race, Republican candidate David Jolly says. His Democratic opponent, Alex Sink, isn't shying away from the health care debate, touting the law's benefits and saying she's open to improvements. Both parties are looking at this race as a testing ground for their messages going into the midterm elections. Florida's 13th District is one of a small number of competitive ones, and Republicans and Democrats say the tight race here will come down to which campaign gets its supporters out. Both sides have spent more than $11 million on media and direct mail, according to data from the Sunlight Foundation. The bulk of that spending comes from outside groups hoping to shape two very different narratives. Eight things to watch between now and Election Day . Republican groups and Jolly's campaign have concentrated on tying Sink to Obamacare and its rocky rollout and to President Barack Obama and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who have low approval ratings among independent voters. Jolly thinks the health care law is a top issue for voters, but the message he was trying to deliver last week at a senior center focused heavily on local issues. ""There is a lot more going on here that just Obamacare,"" he said. Jolly served as a longtime aide to GOP Rep. Bill Young, whose death last October after representing the area for more than 40 years prompted the special election.  At the senior event, Jolly pointed out his connection to Young and the federal resources the late congressman helped to deliver for the district, saying Young was ""nearly a father to me."" Borger: Congress takes the year off . But Democrats are trying to make Jolly's work as a Washington lobbyist after he left Young's staff the driving issue in the campaign, arguing he backed changes to Social Security that could cut benefits. The district has one of the highest concentrations of voters over age 65 in the country. Talk about changing retirement benefits or any concerns that Obamacare provisions could affect health care coverage resonate strongly with voters here. Pre-emptive strategy on Obamacare . Standing next to former Florida Democratic Sen. Bob Graham at an event with seniors at her campaign office, Sink called the current programs ""an American promise"" and said, ""those programs were put in place for a good reason, and I'm going to fight to protect the integrity of the Social Security and Medicare programs for all of us."" Sink, who served as Florida's chief financial officer and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010, recognizes that Obamacare is a major issue.  She acknowledges that the Obama administration's proposal to cut the popular Medicare Advantage is a major worry among older voters, who she says will make up half of the electorate in the race.  Other Democratic candidates tend to avoid the O-word, but Sink talks about the law's benefits and argues she won't go back to the old system. Crist: Democrats 'ought to strengthen up' and support Obamacare . Sink's strategy on Obamacare appears to be pre-emptive: she stresses how the health care law will help people but also notes it has some major flaws that need fixing. She said she is open to Republican-backed plans to change the law's current requirement that employers provide health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours a week. She also said Obamacare's current requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees offer health insurance is ""an arbitrary number"" and says she wants to work across party lines to adjust the law to avoid any ""unintended consequences,"" such as keeping businesses from expanding. Obama: Democrats 'sleepy' during midterms . Jolly reiterates the Republican mantra that Obamacare must be repealed altogether. Because his own campaign hasn't raised nearly as much money as Sink's, the bulk of the ads and direct mail attacking Sink are from the National Republican Campaign Committee and other allies like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Action Network, which backs GOP candidates in House races. Although he concedes it's not likely to happen, Jolly says he remains committed to getting rid of Obamacare entirely.  He ticks through his plan to cover younger workers with a small government program and says he wants to make sure those with pre-existing conditions can always obtain insurance. Some Republicans worry about repeal-Obamacare strategy . He said Obamacare shows ""two very different views of government.  We can talk about specific health care solutions, but it really comes down to a view of government that says we need more government in individual lives.  We need individual mandates and we need more interference between government and families versus a view of government that says no, we don't. That's wrong. "" Some Republicans worry that the bright line the party is drawing about repealing Obamacare isn't the right tactic. Bob Sikora, a resident at the Regency Oaks senior community who supports Jolly, told CNN he thinks the GOP should be talking about improving the law instead of scrapping it entirely. ""I would certainly think personally if I were in charge of his campaign, I would not have said, 'I'm out to repeal it' -- he's been forced to say that by some of the party higher-ups that control the tea party, which is controlling what Republicans are saying right now,"" Sikora said. Sink told CNN the concerns about the health care law are lower on the priority list for people in the district.  She puts it as ""fifth"" on the list of things voters raise with her at forums, after homeowners' worries about the skyrocketing costs of flood insurance, veterans issues, and the fear that any plans to start offshore drilling could hurt the tourism industry in this beach community. But one Sink supporter, Julie Meyer, who runs a retail shop in St. Petersburg, told CNN she thinks voters and the candidates should be talking about Obamacare. ""I would like the conversation. I think there are blatant lies about what is being said about Obamacare and that's very, very unfortunate, because people should be able to decide with the real information,"" Meyer said. Texas kicks off first primary of 2014 . Democrats had a head start . Democrats had the advantage going into the race because they did not have to spend time and money on a primary.  Jolly endured a contentious primary in January and didn't have any significant resources going into the general election.  With no primary opposition, the Sink campaign went to work against Jolly early and stuck with the line of attack that electing him would send someone to Washington who wanted to cut Social Security. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and outside groups have spent millions to drive that message home and link it to Jolly's lobbying history. House Majority PAC, an outside group that backs Democratic candidates, has spent close $750,000 on one ad that says Jolly ""lobbied for a special interest that wanted to privatize Social Security."" Jolly insists that Sink has misrepresented his position on the issue and says he would vote against the House Republican budget authored by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan because of the changes it would make to Social Security and Medicare. ""They spent a million dollars painting me as an extremist and a million dollars on Social Security and Medi-scare and Social Security claims that are false,"" the GOP candidate told CNN. Poll: Anti-incumbent feelings at all-time high . Jolly reiterates he opposes the proposals to privatize retirement accounts or alter how Medicare benefits are structured. ""I think the current reform plans are too aggressive, and I don't think we should pursue them,"" Jolly said. Republicans privately acknowledge that Sink's ability to start her ads early, combined with the fact that her campaign and the outside groups supporting her are outspending them, has hurt. David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report, told CNN that ""Democrats have been more consistent with their message in this race, building a narrative about Jolly as a lobbyist who operates behind closed doors, and that has clearly helped."" District is evenly split . This district is split down the political middle -- 37% of those registered to vote are Republicans, about 35% are Democrats and 28% are unaffiliated or back a third-party candidate.  There is a libertarian candidate, Lucas Overby, competing in the race, and he has participated in the three major debates. But it's unclear what kind of impact he'll have in drawing votes away from Jolly or Sink. Florida allows absentee voting by mail, and well over half of those who were mailed ballots have returned them.  In past election cycles, Republicans have traditionally posted a stronger return rate of absentee ballots, but the Pinellas County supervisors office reports that the GOP holds about a 4-point edge over Democrats sending in their ballots. Voters here frequently mention their distaste for the gridlock in Washington, and supporters of both Sink and Jolly told CNN they aren't sure that their candidate will be able to change much. Tami Simms, a registered independent who backed Young in the past and works as a Realtor in St. Petersburg, told CNN she's voting for Sink.  But she's unsure a new, more junior representative will deliver the same results. ""I know there are some concerns that no one is going to have (the) power that Congressman Young had from his tenure and from his longtime experience. There was more than just his tenure that allowed him to move funding for projects in this area."" If Jolly wins on Tuesday, Republicans will certainly say retaining this competitive seat is a validation of their plan to make Obamacare the central issue this fall. A Democratic victory could have other candidates across the country adopting Sink's approach to discussing health care with a ""fix-it"" attitude. House Speaker John Boehner made it clear that even if the Democrats manage to pick up this seat, his party's midterm strategy won't change.  Asked if a loss in this special election could alter the GOP message of repealing Obamacare, Boehner replied simply, ""No.""","Both parties are testing messages for fall midterms in Tuesday's special election .
Republicans trying use Obamacare to frame midterm elections .
Republican candidate says outside anti-Obamacare ads are drowning other issues .
Democrat is confronting Obamacare debate, saying there's room for improvement ."
"China's first lunar rover deployed successfully from the unmanned spacecraft Chang'e-3 that landed on the moon Saturday. Jade Rabbit (called Yutu in Chinese) is a six-wheeled lunar rover equipped with at least four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples to a depth of 30 meters. The solar-powered rover will patrol the moon's surface, studying the structure of the lunar crust as well as soil and rocks, for at least three months. The robot's name was decided by a public online poll and comes from a Chinese myth about the pet white rabbit of a goddess, Chang'e, who is said to live on the moon. Weighing 140 kilograms, the slow-moving rover carries an optical telescope for astronomical observations and a powerful ultraviolet camera that will monitor how solar activity affects the various layers -- troposphere, stratosphere and ionosphere -- that make up the Earth's atmosphere, China's information technology ministry said in a statement. The Jade Rabbit is also equipped with radioisotope heater units, allowing it to function during the cold lunar nights when temperatures plunge as low as -180°C (-292°F). The moon exploration makes China one of only three nations -- after the United States and the former Soviet Union -- to ""soft-land"" on the moon's surface, and the first to do so in more than three decades. China's space program . China has rapidly built up its space program since it first sent an astronaut into space in 2003. In 2012, the country conducted 18 space launches, according to the Pentagon. The Chang'e-3 mission constitutes the second phase of China's moon exploration program, which includes orbiting, landing and returning to Earth. In 2010, China captured images of the landing site for the 2013 probe, the Bay of Rainbows, which is considered to be one of the most picturesque parts of the moon. Tourist trips to the moon by 2043? Within the next decade, China expects to open a permanent space station in the Earth's orbit. But scientists in the United States have expressed concern that the Chang'e-3 mission could skew the results of a NASA study of the moon's dust environment. The spacecraft's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon's surface that could interfere with research already being carried out by NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), Jeff Plescia, chair of NASA's Lunar Exploration Analysis Group told news site Space.com in November. The Chang'e-3 spacecraft blasted off from a Long March 3B rocket in China's Sichuan province on December 2 and reached the moon's orbit at 100 kilometers (about 60 miles) from its surface less than five days later. On Tuesday, it descended into an elliptical orbit with its lowest point just 15 kilometers off the lunar surface, a spokesperson for China's Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense told Xinhua. The Soviet Union's Luna 24 probe was the last space mission to land on the moon in August 1976 -- four years after the United States launched the manned Apollo 17 mission.

"Russian freestyle skier Maria Komissarova has undergone more than six hours of surgery after breaking her back during a training run at the Winter Games in Sochi, the Russian Freestyle Federation spokesman said Saturday. Komissarova, 23, fractured a vertebra and dislocated her spine when she crashed at the PSX Olympic skicross venue at Rosa Kuhtor, federation spokesman Mikhail Vezhba told the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. ""The operation lasted 6½ hours, and it was successful,"" Vezhba said. ""We'll know more about the details later."" A source close to the situation earlier told the Russian news agency that Komissarova's condition was too serious to transfer her to Moscow. The skier was reportedly in ""unbearable"" pain when she was rushed to the hospital, the news agency reported. Komissarova placed second in a World Cup event in 2012 but was not considered a medal contender in Sochi. She injured her leg last year, requiring surgery and keeping her off the slopes for almost six months. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited with Komissarova in the hospital, news channel Russia-24 reported. Footage showed Putin meeting with the skier, who was on a ventilator, in the hospital.

"(CNN) -- Norway's navy announced on Monday that it will help search for the missing plane of 20th century explorer Roald Amundsen, more than 80 years after his death. Roald Amundsen led the first successful expedition to the South Pole from 1910 to 1912. The search -- scheduled for later this year -- will focus on a 40 square-mile (104 square-kilometer) area of the Arctic Ocean where researchers believe Amundsen's plane crashed in 1928. ""If there is something down there, we will find it,"" said senior Commander Frode Loeseth told CNN. Loeseth said they will be concentrating on finding the plane's wreckage, and do not expect to find any remains. Amundsen, who is a national hero in Norway, led the first successful expedition to the South Pole from 1910 to 1912. He is also credited with being the first person to reach both the North and South Poles. He went missing in June 1928 at the age of 55 while flying to the North Pole for a rescue operation. The location of his disappearance ""is one of the remaining unsolved mysteries in our time,"" a press release from the Norwegian Navy said. Loeseth said the navy will participate in the search along with the Norwegian Aviation Museum; Kongsberg Maritime, a Norwegian maritime technology company; and Context TV, a German TV production company that will document the operation. The search is scheduled to begin the last week of August. There have been several attempts to find the location of Amundsen's crash, most recently in 2004. But this time Norway's navy will be able to scour the depths of the Arctic Ocean with a submarine, named after a character in Norse mythology. ""We have one special tool -- Hugin -- that is a state-of-the-art submarine, unmanned, and can search for 18 hours,"" the commander said. Hugin is the mythological raven that traveled around Earth and informed the Norse god, Odin, of what happened that day. Loeseth said the navy has had the unmanned submarine for some time, but the one that will be used in the search is the Hugin 1000, a ""newly modified and upgraded"" model. Loeseth would not say how much the operation was expected to cost, or which organization was funding the bulk of the search. He stressed that the partners have an agreement and a budget, and Norwegian taxpayers will not be paying for any part of the search. He said Amundsen's relatives support the project. He noted that it has been five years since the last search for Amundsen's wreckage because ""it takes time to raise funding for such projects.""","Unmanned submarine to be used in search for Roald Amundsen's plane .

"Two cruise ships marked the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the RMS Titanic by tossing wreaths into the North Atlantic early Sunday morning directly over the site of the ship's wreckage. The 450 passengers gathered on the Azamara Journey, a ship chartered for a ""Titanic Memorial Cruise,"" began their evening of remembrance by sitting in silence as 1,503 names of those who perished aboard the Titanic were displayed on a projection screen. A ceremony followed. ""We pray for the departed, especially those who died on this night 100 years ago,"" said the Rev. Robert Lawrence. ""We pray for the relatives of all those who died in Titanic."" Descendants of the dead, as well as Titanic enthusiasts, were among the crowd that had gathered for the occasion. Earlier in the night, an announcement was made to let passengers know they were passing over the point where the Titanic put out its distress signal, alerting others that they needed help.

Families of the victims and dignitaries were seated facing the hearses and a lectern. ""There's no doubt these are difficult days,"" said Obama. But he pledged that ""the United States of America will never retreat from the world."" ""Four Americans, four patriots, they loved their country and chose to serve it and serve it well,"" the president continued. ""They had a mission and they believed in it, and they knew the danger and they accepted it. They didn't simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it, they embodied it: the courage, the hope and, yes, the idealism. ""We will bring to justice those who took them from us,"" Obama said. Clinton said that Libya, Egypt and Tunisia ""did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob."" Those countries' leaders ""need to do everything they can to restore security"" in the face of anti-American protests arising from an ""awful Internet video,"" she said. Clinton said the four victims' lives -- as well as all people who work in the Foreign Service -- ""are at the heart of what makes America great and good."" ""America must keep leading the world. We owe it to the these four men to continue the long, hard work of diplomacy,"" Clinton said. ""We will wipe our tears and stiffen our spines and face the future undaunted."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Vice President Joe Biden also attended the ceremony. The other men killed in Libya include Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEAL commandos working as diplomatic security officers. The fourth was Sean Smith, an information management officer who also had an online alter-ego legendary in the gaming world. Four people have been arrested in connection with the attack that left Stevens and the three other Americans dead, the top aide to the president of the Libyan parliament said Friday. Those arrested were not directly tied to the attack, Monem Elyasser, the chief aide to Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur, told CNN by telephone. Elyasser did not release the identities of the four suspects in custody, nor did he detail the allegations against them. The announcement came as the United States is struggling to determine whether a militant group planned the attack that killed the four Americans. Blog: Arrest and violence updates . The head of Libya's ruling General National Congress, Mohammed Al-Megaryef, also confirmed the four arrests but declined to say to what group the suspects are linked. However, the government now believes the suspects are part of one of the many armed extremist groups operating especially in the eastern part of the country and Benghazi itself, he told CNN. Authorities also believe the attack was planned and deliberately carried out to inflict maximum damage on key Western interests, particularly the United States, he said. The government believes the attack was intended to drive a wedge between Americans and Libyans. Asked what the Libyan government was doing to ensure security, al-Megaryef answered, ""We are doing our best to avoid further attacks."" But he acknowledged that authorities had little capacity to defend against the powerful extremist groups. State Department Under Secretary Patrick Kennedy has said that the attack appeared to be planned because it was so extensive and because of the ""proliferation"" of small and medium weapons at the scene. He was briefing congressional staffers when he offered that theory. But on Thursday, three U.S. officials told CNN that they had seen no evidence the attack was premeditated. A team of FBI investigators is expected to be in Libya by Saturday, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Agents are first conducting interviews outside the country to gather information about the attack, the source said. Obama vowed Thursday that those responsible for the attack would be brought to justice. ""I want people around the world to hear me. To those that would do us harm -- no act of terror will go unpunished. It will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world. No act of violence shakes the resolve of the United States of America."" Source: Al Qaeda central not behind Benghazi attack . During an interview on CNNI's ""Amanpour,"" Abushagur said Thursday that there had been one arrest early Thursday in Benghazi and that three or four others were being pursued. ""The evidence itself is based on mostly pictures that were taken around the compound at that time, and also through some witnesses,"" the prime minister said. Conflicting theories flew in the hours after the four Americans were killed late Tuesday. They died amid a protest outside the U.S. Consulate over a film that ridiculed Muslims and depicted the Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer. The demonstration was one of several protests across the region that day. Protest as diversion . U.S. officials believe the attackers used the protest as a diversion. Given what officials know about al Qaeda in Libya, intelligence officials believe it is very unlikely that core al Qaeda was behind the attack, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to release the information. Meanwhile, Shawn Turner, director of communications for U.S. National Intelligence, denied news reports that American officials had been warned of a possible attack. ""This is absolutely wrong,"" he said. ""We are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the U.S. post in Benghazi was planned or imminent."" Slain ambassador warned in '08 about extremists near Benghazi . The United States is deploying warships and surveillance drones in its hunt for the killers of the diplomatic staffers, and a contingent of 50 Marines has arrived to boost the security of Americans in the country. The United States and Libya have embarked on a new relationship since rebels toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi last year. U.S. and NATO warplanes helped the Benghazi-based rebellion against Gadhafi, who was wanted by the International Criminal Court for charges of crimes against humanity before he was killed in October. The jihadists suspected in Tuesday night's attack ""are a very small minority"" who are taking advantage of a fledgling democracy, said Ali Suleiman Aujali, the Libyan ambassador to the United States. Sources tracking militant Islamist groups in eastern Libya say a pro-al Qaeda group responsible for a previous armed assault on the Benghazi consulate is the chief suspect. A senior defense official told CNN the drones will be part of ""a stepped-up, more focused search"" for a particular insurgent cell that may be behind the killings. Rights groups have raised concerns about the Libyan legal system, which is in the early days of being rebuilt following the fall of the Gadhafi regime. ""Due process violations against detainees in Libya are the norm,"" Human Rights Watch said in a June report. ""Libyan government officials told Human Rights Watch that very few detainees have been formally charged and that very few of the cases have been reviewed by a judicial authority."" At the same time, the dominance of militia groups, ""which in most towns and cities are stronger than the army and police, has complicated the rebuilding of Libya's justice system,"" the report says. Amnesty International has similarly warned of serious problems with Libya's legal system. Its researchers also ""found that hundreds of armed militias are acting above the law."" Questions swirl around the attack . There are numerous questions about what happened at the consulate where protesters had gathered to demonstrate against the film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" which reportedly was made in California by a filmmaker whose identity is unclear. Chief among the questions is what happened to Stevens, who went missing during the attack. What is known is that during the attack, a rocket-propelled grenade set the consulate on fire, and American and Libyan security personnel tried to fight the attackers and the fire. As the fire spread, three people -- Stevens, Foreign Service information management officer Smith, and a U.S. regional security officer -- were inside a safe room, said senior State Department officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity as a matter of practice during a briefing with reporters. Smith was later found dead, apparently of smoke inhalation, officials said. The State Department has not released details about how Stevens died, though numerous media reports have said the ambassador was taken from the consulate to the Benghazi Medical Center by locals. He arrived at the hospital, according to the reports, unresponsive and covered in soot from the fire. A doctor was unable to revive him and declared him dead, the reports said. Stevens' body was turned over to consulate personnel as they were evacuated from Benghazi. As of Friday night, funeral plans had not been announced for the four Americans.

"(CNN) -- After months of speculation, one of Formula One's worst kept secrets has finally been confirmed. Fernando Alonso, the double world champion who recently left Ferrari, will rejoin McLaren for the 2015 season, which gets underway in March. The Spaniard, who won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, joins the British team after ending his four-year association with Ferrari. He will be partnered by Jenson Button, whose services were retained above Kevin Magnussen, who stays on as a test and reserve driver. Between them, Alonso and Button have won three world titles, 47 grands prix and achieved 147 podium finishes from a combined 500 races. Now 33, Alonso will be expected to boost McLaren's fortunes after a season which saw it struggle to match the pace set by the all-conquering Mercedes team. ""Over the past year I have received several offers, some of them really tempting given the current performance of some of the teams that showed interest,"" he said in a statement. ""But, more than a year ago, McLaren-Honda contacted me and asked me to take part, in a very active way, in the return of their partnership -- a partnership that dominated the Formula 1 scene for so long."" Between 1988 and 1992, McLaren and Honda won 44 grands prix out of 80, with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost winning all but one of the 16 races in one season. ""I still remember, as a kid, the posters in my wardrobe, my toy cars in which I dreamed I would one day emulate Ayrton, and the kart that my father built for my older sister, and that I ended up falling in love with,"" Alonso added. ""That kart had the livery of one of the most legendary partnerships in the history of Formula 1, McLaren-Honda, the car that Ayrton drove, the same partnership to which I am now honored to join. ""I am joining this project with enormous enthusiasm and determination, knowing that it may require some time to achieve the results we are aiming for, which is no problem for me."" It remains to be seen whether McLaren's new engine partnership with Honda returns it to the top of the sport. Alonso previously joined McLaren in 2007, but left after just one season due to tensions between him and then rookie teammate Lewis Hamilton -- the now Mercedes driver who was crowned 2014 world champion last month. This time around, Alonso will be paired with the vastly experienced Button. The Briton, who won the 2009 drivers' title with Brawn, has signed a new deal to extend his four-year stay with the team. ""I am extremely excited to be embarking on my 16th year in Formula 1 and my sixth season for McLaren,"" said the 34-year-old, whose future had been heavily debated in recent days. ""Like Fernando, I am certain that McLaren and Honda will achieve great things together, and I feel sure that, working together, all of us will pull incredibly hard to create a brilliantly effective winning team. ""I admired Ayrton Senna enormously, but, for me, it was the exploits of Alain Prost that inspired me most as a boy. 'The best driver lineup' ""The way he stroked those beautifully brutal red-and-white cars to grand prix wins and world championships was to my mind poetry in motion, and I have tried to emulate his driving style ever since. ""Being a part of new-look McLaren-Honda is a wonderful opportunity for all of us and I am very pleased to have been invited to do my bit. In fact, I am absolutely raring to go."" ""I am sure (Fernando and I) will work extremely well together."" After plenty of uncertainty over whether Button or Magnussen would be retained for 2015, McLaren chairman and CEO Ron Dennis is delighted with the pairing of two former world champions. ""I can safely say that we now have by an order of magnitude the best driver lineup of any current Formula 1 team,"" he said. ""We signed Fernando a little ago, but we decided not to announce the fact until we had also re-signed Jenson as his teammate. For many reasons, our negotiations with Jenson took quite a long time."" The decision to retain Button means Magnussen loses his seat after just one season in the sport. The Dane finished 71 points behind Button in this year's championship. ""I am very glad that Kevin will remain part of the team,"" said Button. ""He is a very quick driver and a really nice guy.""","Two-time world champion Alonso rejoins McLaren, the stable he left in 2007 .

"One day after naming the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, Egypt arrested more than 100 people across the country Thursday, state media reported. State-run MENA said among those arrested were 54 members of the Muslim Brotherhood charged with attacking police stations and inciting violence. The suspects were also accused of inciting riots and blocking roads, according to MENA. The news agency reported at least nine different roundups of people. A spokesman of the interior minister, Hany Abd El-Fattah, said anyone who is a member of the Brotherhood will receive a five-year prison sentence, MENA reported. People who help finance the group will be given a sentence of hard labor. Al-Masriya TV, a state-run broadcaster said the interior ministry will detain anyone who attends a Muslim Brotherhood protest and they, too, will be sentenced to five years in prison. On its official English language website, the Muslim Brotherhood vowed to press on with its protests and said it was time was ""escalate revolutionary wrath."" ""Let's begin with full force and peacefulness a new wave of majestic anti-coup action in a 'Revolutionary Rage' week,"" the group said. The interim Egyptian Cabinet declared the Muslim Brotherhood to be a terror group Wednesday, the latest move in a crackdown against the group that backed deposed President Mohamed Morsy. Morsy, the nation's first democratically elected President, was forced out of office in July and arrested, with detractors saying he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy Thursday to express U.S. concern over the declaration. ""The secretary underscored the need for an inclusive political process across the political spectrum that respects the fundamental human rights of all Egyptians in order to achieve political stability and democratic change,"" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Bomb blast hurts five . Five people were wounded Thursday in an explosion near Al-Azhar University in Cairo's Nasr City neighborhood, according to local media reports. A bomb disposal team defused a second bomb, al-Masriya reported. The Nasr City neighborhood is a traditional stronghold of supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. It was the second bombing of the week. On Tuesday, 16 people were killed in an attack on a police headquarters in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. Ansar Jerusalem, a jihadist group responsible for attacks in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the twin bombing. Also Thursday, one person was killed and seven were arrested in clashes between students and residents who live near Al-Azhar University, the Interior Ministry said. EgyNews, a state-run news agency, reported the Interior Ministry told police to confiscate copies of the Muslim Brotherhood's newspaper, stop its publication and seal off the Justice and Freedom publishing house that print the group's daily. Thursday's unrest comes in the lead-up to Egypt's referendum on a new constitution, which will be held January 14-15. If passed, the constitution would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military.","Egyptian broadcaster reports at least nine different roundups .

"Two Northern California men made brief appearances in federal court Wednesday in what began as another big pot-growing drug bust but what has become a horrifying story of one teenager's alleged torment, captivity and sexual abuse. The criminal complaint against the two men -- Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain, 24 -- outlines the allegations of a 15-year-old girl's ordeal of being held in a coffin-like box for hours on end at a marijuana-growing ""farm"" where she worked trimming plants. Balletto and Pearmain were criminally charged in federal court earlier this month -- and are in custody without bail -- with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants and with using a minor in a drug operation. Additionally Pearmain faces state charges of kidnapping to commit robbery or rape and unlawful sex with a minor. Balletto faces state charges of lewd and lascivious acts with a child. They appeared before a federal judge during a three-minute hearing Wednesday, according to court records. No pleas were entered, and arraignment of the two is set for Friday in federal court, according to records. Efforts Wednesday to reach attorneys for the two men were not successful. The girl sometimes was held in a metal toolbox 4 feet long, 2 feet wide and 2 feet high, authorities said. According to the criminal complaint, she told authorities that the men  ""put her in the box to 'teach' her because they had a 'point to prove.'"" The girl referred to the marijuana operation as a ""mission"" and said the men locked her in the box to protect the operation, according to the complaint. ""Specifically, they did not want (the girl) to 'ruin the mission' or 'go off and say something about the mission,'"" the complaint stated. Abused but alive . The box was hoisted at an angle to allow a hose to be inserted ""to wash her off and rinse human waste from the inside of the box without letting her out,"" the complaint said. Federal authorities declined to comment Tuesday on the whereabouts or current condition of the girl. But a psychologist who had read about the case told CNN that he was shocked by the details and that he believes the girl will suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""She is no different from, say, a POW ... She was in a box. She's going to need a lot of therapeutic treatment,"" said California-based clinical psychologist Mark Burdick, who is not involved in the case. ""This is obviously a very traumatic situation for her...It is cruel, cruel and unusual punishment for a 15-year-old girl, and she will undoubtedly need a structured therapeutic environment for what could be years,"" Burdick said. According to the criminal complaint, federal agents began a suspected narcotics investigation in late 2011, and Balletto was one of the individuals suspected. Last August, agents identified land that he had bought in Lake County, California, north of San Francisco. During a surveillance flyover of that land in April, a Lake County detective spotted two greenhouses that appeared to be full of marijuana plants. Meanwhile, also in April, the Los Angeles Police Department ""requested urgent assistance of the Lake County Sheriff's Department regarding a missing juvenile from the Los Angeles area,"" the complaint stated. The minor was traced from a cell phone call to a hotel in Sacramento, where she was found with Pearmain on April 30, the complaint said. He was immediately taken into custody, and the girl was placed in protective custody. Authorities said they also found a black notebook in Pearmain's possession with a script apparently for the girl to read from if confronted by police. Balletto was taken into custody on May 1 when he was found in a trailer on the property that had been under surveillance. According to the complaint, the minor said she worked for Balletto by trimming the marijuana plants on what she referred to as the ""farm."" The girl then went on to describe an ordeal of being held in the box twice ""for a total of approximately three days,"" according to the complaint. She said both men ""engaged in multiple sex acts with her,"" and Balletto ""told her she was a 'trooper' because she didn't scream in the box,"" the complaint said. ""A poem signed by (the girl) found in Balletto's trailer described her life as being locked inside a box with holes in it,"" the complaint added. At the property, authorities found the two greenhouses with 970 individually potted and irrigated marijuana plants, according to the complaint. Authorities later found a third greenhouse with an additional 346 plants. Authorities also uncovered a stash of weapons including, assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, loaded magazines, night-vision scopes, ballistic face masks and gas masks, body armor and a large cache of assorted ammunition, according to the complaint. The Northern District of California U.S. attorney's office said a search of Balletto's residence uncovered even more weapons, including several sniper rifles and additional assault rifles. Lake County Sheriff's Department Lt. Chris Chwialkowski said the stash was one of the largest collection of weapons seized in his department's history. Tatum King, acting special agent in charge of investigations for the Homeland Security office in San Francisco, which mounted the federal narcotics investigation, said, ""The criminal groups involved in growing and trafficking marijuana have repeatedly shown they have no qualms about using violence and intimidation against those who get in their way. ""In this case the alleged victim was only 15 years old.""","Two suspects make brief court appearances .

"Apps4Africa has just announced the three winners of its 2012 competition, showcasing the best in African innovation. The winners, chosen from nearly 300 submissions, were Ffene, from Uganda, an app that helps small and medium businesses reduce administrative costs; SliceBiz, from Ghana, a crowdsourcing platform to encourage middle class Africans to invest small amounts in high-growth startups; and Prowork, from Nigeria, which is a project management and real-time collaboration tool for businesses. The Apps4Africa competition began in late 2009 as an annual program that aimed to support African social entrepreneurs using technology to solve societal problems. This year's competition demonstrated again that Africa has innovation and a growing number of innovators. But now the challenge for technology entrepreneurs is not merely to innovate and create apps, but to turn them into lucrative business ideas. Read this: 10 African tech voices to follow on Twitter . During my trips to Africa while coordinating the Apps4Africa competition, I witnessed from the innovators a real desire to innovate and have their voices heard. But whilst a technology revolution is taking place in Africa, with so many of these young men and women building and creating apps, they still face huge challenges in understanding how to start businesses around their innovations. Most of the innovators are following trends and their dreams, inspired mostly by the stories of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs making it without a clear business plan or any structured road map when they started their businesses many years ago. The reality check has not yet taken place in the minds of Africa's innovators and lots of time is being wasted on unrealistic desires. Young entrepreneurs in Africa have a mosaic of demands that need urgent attention. Policy makers need to start taking the young entrepreneurs seriously, as they are the future of Africa. Read this: Web savvy Africans fuel growth in online shopping . The growing number of competitions and gatherings -- like Apps4Africa, Startup Weekend, Africa Gathering, Maker Faire, Pivot East and BarCamps -- help to give visibility and credibility to these innovators, but this is not enough. The young African innovator needs business skills and funding. However, preparatory brainstorming gatherings, where people meet to share ideas, cement relationships and learn, could form the missing link that helps to create a culture of entrepreneurship and trust, that challenges and empowers the technology entrepreneurs to do more for Africa, and encourages the funders to support them. Now the competition is over, with the prize money coming soon into the winners' bank accounts, what is next for them? Many people are asking this legitimate question. One thing is sure, the entrepreneurs have ideas; the proof is that we have banks of apps being developed from the continent. But 90% of the people who attended the Apps4Africa sessions, with their business ideas in hand, need mentoring. Read this: Shaping Africa's tech revolution . The ecosystem in their countries to facilitate the creation of companies and a culture of entrepreneurship and risk taking is currently in its infancy or non-existent. Funding is currently a big issue. Investors don't take the technologists seriously, say the entrepreneurs. Whilst their intentions and ideas are good, many of the entrepreneurs that I meet need to be mentored intensively. Investors don't have time for this. African policy makers need to seriously invest in creating more business schools and put the right infrastructures into place to save the private sector industry of Africa and youth of Africa. Technology hubs and innovative spaces are addressing these current needs. The Apps4Africa winners now need to scale up their business models; this means they will need more funding, mentoring and manpower. To respond to this growing need, I have launched Spotone Mentoring @spot1mentoring, a new social enterprise initiative committed to supporting, guiding, unlocking the potential of the growing numbers of bedroom entrepreneurs in Africa. With its official launch in the summer, it's an initiative I hope can help Africa's innovators to scale up and become profitable.","Ffene, SliceBiz and Prowork are the three winners of the Apps4Africa 2012 competition .

"Boston (CNN) -- Reputed mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger wants a judge to clamp down on leaks from federal agents about his case, arguing Tuesday they endanger the former fugitive's right to a fair trial on murder charges. ""If it is now possible -- and Mr. Bulger seriously questions whether it will be possible -- for Mr. Bulger to receive a fair trial, law enforcement leaks of non-public information must end, with disclosures of information limited to the judicial process,"" his interim attorney, Peter Krupp, wrote. Prosecutors say the 81-year-old Bulger was the boss of South Boston's Irish mob before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995. At the same time, he was an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the basis for the Oscar-winning crime drama ""The Departed."" U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf issued no rulings during Tuesday's brief hearing, which is scheduled to reconvene Thursday afternoon. But he told prosecutors to submit a plan for stopping any leaks by Wednesday. Bulger was arrested last week in California, along with his longtime girlfriend, 60-year-old Catherine Elizabeth Greig. He now faces 19 counts of murder, while she has been charged with harboring a fugitive. Bulger appeared in court in orange jail coveralls Tuesday. He has asked for a public defender, but prosecutors -- who said FBI agents seized more than $822,000 in cash from Bulger's Santa Monica apartment -- say he should pick up his own legal tab. ""He has every incentive to lie and stick the taxpayers with the bill for his defense,"" prosecutors wrote in court papers filed Tuesday. They said Bulger has admitted to stashing more money away with ""people he trusted"" but would not name, and suggested that Bulger's brother William could pay for a lawyer. William Bulger is a former president of the University of Massachusetts and state Senate leader. He was forced to step down from his university job after then-Gov. Mitt Romney, now a Republican presidential candidate, accused him of being evasive during congressional testimony about ""Whitey's"" whereabouts. Prosecutors asked Wolf to require both William Bulger and a third Bulger brother, John Bulger, to submit affidavits before a decision is made. Bulger also asked the judge to order federal agents to turn over notes of their interviews with him following his capture, arguing the documents are needed to defend himself against charges that he has hidden assets and will assist his defense. Bulger lived ""a relatively comfortable lifestyle"" for the 16 years he was a fugitive, taking numerous gambling trips to Las Vegas, according to a government document filed in his case. Prosecutors say Bulger waived his Miranda rights after his arrest and told agents who were taking him back to Boston that he had been ""a frequent traveler as a fugitive,"" according to the government. ""Bulger acknowledged visiting Las Vegas on numerous occasions to play the slots and claimed he won more than he lost,"" the filing said. ""Bulger also admitted traveling to San Diego and then crossing over into Tijuana to purchase medicines."" Bulger also told the feds that he traveled back to Boston ""on several occasions while 'armed to the teeth' because he 'had to take care of some unfinished business,'"" the document said.  Bulger refused to tell the agents any details of his Boston visits, it said. Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss Bulger from the earlier racketeering indictment. Those counts included allegations that Bulger and his associates engaged in loan sharking, shaking down bookies and drug dealers, and attempting to fix horse races. The murder case against him ""not only carries higher penalties, but is stronger both factually and legally than this matter,"" prosecutors wrote. Meanwhile, two key witnesses have died, and Bulger's status as an informant has complicated the case, they wrote. But Krupp called the move ""troubling,"" suggesting the government was ""forum-shopping"" by trying to drop the earlier case. Wolf told Krupp he would be handling the issue for Bulger until a decision was made on his request for a court-appointed lawyer. CNN's Sheila Steffen contributed to this report.","NEW: Bulger argues leaks endanger a fair trial .

"(CNN) -- The case against Anthony Sowell is grounded in his Cleveland backyard. There, in October 2009, investigators unearthed remains of five of the 11 women -- ages 25 to 52 -- found on Sowell's property. On Monday, jury selection for Sowell's trial begins in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. Sowell faces 85 counts related to his alleged rape, murder and dismembering of the women between 2007 and 2009 -- charges to which he's pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Since the bodies were discovered, other women have come forward alleging that Sowell also attacked them. In April 2010, prosecutors handed down an 10-count indictment against Sowell in connection with the alleged rape of a 34-year-old woman in his Cleveland home. Sowell's lawyers have declined previous requests by CNN to explain their case, and the suspect has not been interviewed. But in January 2010, attorney John Parker told The Plain Dealer newspaper in Cleveland that he felt police violated Sowell's Miranda rights as he was being interrogated. But those likely to decide Sowell's future have already had their first opportunity to take a measure of the man. About 200 prospective jurors were introduced to the accused serial killer Friday morning at the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in Cleveland, county court administrator Greg Popovich said. They also met Judge Dick Ambrose, the presiding judge in the case, as well as the defense and prosecution teams. Dressed in a polo shirt and khaki pants, and unencumbered by handcuffs or shackles (even though he was escorted by six deputies), Sowell addressed the jurors simply by saying, ""Hello."" Popovich described the event as ""unusual"" but necessary to ""ensure the integrity of the process in the interest of justice"" -- though he didn't elaborate on how it did. Following the meeting, the potential jurors went through an hour-long orientation and then were asked to fill out a 32-page questionnaire. Should they be tapped for the jury, they will sit through what Popovich estimates will be a six-to-eight week trial documenting the gruesome case against Sowell. Sowell grew up in East Cleveland, joined the Marines at age 18 and traveled to California, North Carolina and Japan, authorities said. People who interacted with him after his 2005 release from prison, where he had served 15 years for attempted rape, said he appeared to be ""a normal guy,"" known locally for selling scrap metal. His inconspicuous two-story home sits in a dilapidated neighborhood known as Mount Pleasant, where one in five homes were in foreclosure and at least a third of residents got food stamps, according to a 2010 study by Case Western Reserve University's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development. Neighbors and even a city councilman had failed to realize that the stench wafting in the area around Sowell's home was human flesh, not a byproduct of a nearby sausage factory. Moreover, the disappearance of the 11 women -- many of whom lived nearby -- went largely unnoticed for almost two years, with only four of them even being reported missing. Many of his alleged victims struggled with drug addiction at some point in their lives, with court records showing that many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. In late 2008, Gladys Wade told police that a man in a gray hoodie offered her beer, and when she declined, punched her in the face several times. Wade said that he then tried to rape her, dragging her toward his home, adding that she got out only after ""gouging his face."" Police investigated Wade's complaint, with one police report noting blood droplets on Sowell's walls and steps. But officers told CNN affiliate WKYC that the case was dropped after Wade declined to press charges. After Wade's complaint, six more women would disappear. Then, on September 23, 2009, a 36-year-old Cleveland woman told police a story eerily similar to those of Wade and the woman whose 1989 account led to Sowell's first conviction for attempted rape. She said he'd invited her into his home for beer, punched her in the face, then began performing oral sex on her -- releasing her only after she promised to return the next day. Sowell was then arrested. More than a month later, police entered his house and found two bodies rotting in his attic. These were the first of the 11 bodies they'd eventually discover, in various states of decay, on his property. Most of the women whose remains were found in and around Sowell's home were strangled by ligature -- which can include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said. Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. A skull is all that remains of one victim. It was found wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed in a bucket in the home's basement. While the prosecution will press its case against Sowell in the coming weeks, this may not be the end of his story -- even if he is eventually given a death sentence. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason has said that his cold case unit is reviewing unsolved murders that occurred during the time Sowell lived in Cleveland and East Cleveland to see if there are any connections. Mason said the group is working its way through 75 cases.

"U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue American journalist James Foley and other hostages held by Islamic militants, a U.S. official told CNN. Several dozen of the most elite U.S. commandos from units like Delta Force and Navy SEAL Team 6 flew in aboard helicopters but couldn't find the hostages, including Foley, whose grisly execution was captured on video and released this week by ISIS, the terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. ""Unfortunately, the mission was not successful because the hostages were not present at the targeted location,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said on Wednesday. It's the latest revelation about Foley's final days in the hands of ISIS, which taunted his family in an e-mail a week ago, saying he would be killed. ""The message was vitriolic and filled with rage against the United States. It was deadly serious,"" said Philip Balboni, CEO of the online publication GlobalPost, which employed Foley. ""Obviously, we hoped and prayed that would not be the case. ... Sadly, they showed no mercy."" Balboni told the Wall Street Journal that the captors originally demanded a ransom sum of 100 million euros ($132.5 million) from Foley's family and GlobalPost. Then came the message sent to Foley's family last week. ""There was no demand,"" Balboni said. Obama: ISIS is a 'cancer' Obama says ISIS a 'cancer' that must be eradicated . In the video, which CNN is not showing, Foley is seen on his knees as a man cloaked in black, his face covered, stands behind him. Foley is then executed. The video of his killing also shows another U.S. journalist, believed to be Steven Sotloff. The militant in the video, who speaks English with what sounds like a British accent, says the other American's life hangs in the balance, depending on what President Barack Obama does next in Iraq. But the threat did little to curb U.S. military operations in Iraq, with American warplanes carrying out at least 14 airstrikes against ISIS targets. Calling ISIS a ""cancer,"" Obama said the United States ""will continue to confront this hateful terrorism and replace it with a sense of hope and civility."" Several ISIS operatives were killed in the special operation earlier this summer that tried to rescue Foley and others, the U.S. official said. No U.S. personnel were killed, but one was slightly wounded. Fighters jets and surveillance aircraft provided overhead protection to the troops. Who is the ISIS? Foley's father: They showed no mercy . Messages from Foley's captors began last fall, Balboni of GlobalPost said. Foley, a freelance journalist, was on assignment when he disappeared on November 22, 2012, in northwest Syria, near the border with Turkey. ""The captors never messaged a lot. There was a very limited number with a very specific purpose. ... They made demands,"" Balboni said. Some messages were political and some were financial. Then came the final message last week, without any demand. Foley's family, according to Balboni, responded in an e-mail, pleading for mercy and asking for more time. They did not hear back. The captors showed no mercy, Foley's father, John, told reporters on Wednesday, breaking down in tears. Foley's family appears to have been among the journalist's final thoughts. In the execution video posted Tuesday to YouTube, Foley reads a message, presumably scripted in part, if not all, by his captors. ""I wish I had more time. I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again,"" he can be heard saying. Foley's parents, flanked by one of his brothers, talked to reporters about their son's plight. ""Jim was innocent and they knew it,"" his mother, Diane, said. ""They knew that Jim was just a symbol of our country."" His father broke down several times. ""We beg compassion and mercy"" for the other American journalist shown in the video, said John Foley. Sotloff, a contributor to Time and Foreign Policy magazines, was kidnapped at the Syria-Turkey border in 2013. ""They never hurt anybody,"" John Foley said. ""They were trying to help. There is no reason for their slaughter."" James Foley, 40, previously had been taken captive in Libya. He was detained there in April 2011 along with three other reporters, and released six weeks later. Afterward, he said that what saddened him most was knowing that he was causing his family to worry. His parents talked about asking him why he wanted to return to conflict zones. ""Why do firemen keep going back to blazing homes?"" John Foley told reporters. ""This was his passion. He was not crazy. He was motivated by what he thought was doing the right thing ... that gave him energy to continue despite the risk."" His mother said she remembered him telling her, ""Mom, I found my passion. I found my vocation."" Source: Foley tortured, beaten . Disturbing details about Foley's final months began to emerge Wednesday. A source who claims to have been held last year with Foley told CNN's Bharati Naik that he, Foley and another journalist were held from March to August 2013 in a prison in the Syrian city of Aleppo near Masha al-Adfaa hospital. At the time, the source -- who spoke on condition of anonymity -- said they were being held by al-Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. At one point, according to the source, there were almost 100 people -- including other European journalists -- in the prison. The source believes Foley and the other journalist, who was not Sotloff, were transferred to an ISIS training camp. Foley and the other journalist, according to the source, were tortured in prison -- mostly beaten. Foley and the other journalist, who the source declined to identify, said they gave him contact numbers and e-mail addresses to pass on messages to their family members. The source told CNN he lost the contacts and did not get in touch with the families. He said he did, however, give the information about the journalists to Western government authorities in November 2013, including details about where Foley was being held. French journalist Nicolas Henin told France Info radio he had been held with Foley in northern Syria prior to his release in April. Henin, who has never before spoken about Foley because he didn't want to jeopardize his safety, said he was held for seven months with the American journalist. Hostages were held in groups. At one point, he shared a cell with Foley. Foley ""was in a difficult state,"" Henin said. ""He already suffered a lot during his first months (of captivity) and thankfully we shared a phase (in our detention) that was less difficult."" Foley, according to Henin, said he had been initially kidnapped by a group of jihadists who were fighting in Syria. The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates there are about 20 journalists missing in Syria, many of them held by ISIS. Among them is American Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post. Tice disappeared in Syria in August 2012. There has been no word of or from him since his abduction. What to know about ISIS . Searching for clues . U.S. and British counterterrorism analysts are examining every frame and piece of audio of the execution video for clues about where it took place and who the executioner is, U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. The voice in the video seems to have a British accent so they're trying to match any individuals known to the British government who may have gone to Syria to fight in that nation's civil war. The analysts are looking at clothing, climate, terrain, language and wording and whether there are any National Security Agency or UK phone intercepts matching the voice, the officials said. U.S. Official: ISIS 'credible alternative to al Qaeda' Foley's killing recalled the murder of Daniel Pearl, The Wall Street Journal correspondent who was kidnapped while reporting in Pakistan in January 2002. His killing was captured on video and posted online by al Qaeda. Pearl's mother, Ruth Pearl, responded to Foley's death with a tweet posted by the Daniel Pearl Foundation Twitter account that reads: ""Our hearts go out to the family of journalist James Foley. We know the horror they are going through."" Foley's death also harkened to the videotaped beheadings of Americans Nicholas Berg, Eugene Armstrong and Jack Hensley carried out by al Qaeda during the height of the Iraq War.

"New York (CNN) -- Protesters gathered in lower Manhattan mid-day Sunday to demonstrate against plans to build a mosque near the site of Ground Zero, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed by Islamist hijackers on September 11, 2001. Protest organizer Pamela Geller, a conservative blogger, and her group, ""Stop the Islamicization of America,"" planned the event because, according to the group's website, ""Building the Ground Zero mosque is not an issue of religious freedom, but of resisting an effort to insult the victims of 9/11 and to establish a beachhead for political Islam and Islamic supremacism in New York... Ground Zero is a war memorial, a burial ground. Respect it."" Geller said the NYPD and security at the rally told her about 5,000 demonstrators were there. But NYPD spokesman Sgt. Kevin Hayes said the police department's policy is to not provide crowd estimates and that he could not confirm Geller's number. CNN iReporter Julio Ortiz-Teissonniere, who attended the rally and sent photos to CNN, said the number was closer to 200-300 while he was there for the first 45 minutes of the event. All three said the protest was peaceful. Human rights advocates, politicians and families of 9/11 victims addressed the crowd. Both Geller and Ortiz-Teissonniere said those family members elicited a powerful, emotional response from the protesters. Geller recently told CNN's Joy Behar that no one's telling the mosque's planners they can't build it, but ""We're asking them not to."" ""We feel it would be more appropriate maybe to build a center dedicated to expunging the Quranic texts of the violent ideology that inspired jihad, or perhaps a center to the victims of hundreds of millions of years of jihadi wars, land enslavements, cultural annihilations and mass slaughter,"" Geller said. The project calls for a 13-story community center including a mosque, performing art center, gym, swimming pool and other public spaces. It is a collaboration between the American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative. The Cordoba Initiative aims to improve relations between Muslims and the West. ""The Cordoba Initiative hopes to build a $100 million, 13-story community center with Islamic, interfaith and secular programming, similar to the 92nd Street Y,"" its website says, referring to the cultural institution on the upper East side of Manhattan. Daisy Khan of the American Society for Muslim Advancement told CNN it was a ""community center with a prayer space inside."" She said the project was an opportunity for American Muslims living in New York to ""give back"" to the community. ""There is a lot of ignorance about who Muslims are. A center like this will be dedicated to removing that ignorance and it will also counter the extremists because moderate Muslims need a voice,"" she told CNN. ""Their voices need to be amplified."" Local political leaders turned out in support of the community last month after Mark Williams of the conservative Tea Party Express reportedly said the mosque was for ""the worship of the terrorists' monkey-god."" ""To make room for peace there can be no room for hatred, bigotry or prejudice,"" City Councilman Robert Jackson said at the May 20 demonstration. The project has the backing of the Community Board of lower Manhattan. It does not require city permission to go ahead. iReport: Protests against mosque near Ground Zero . The plan has split people touched by the September 11 attacks. ""Lower Manhattan should be made into a shrine for the people who died there,"" said Michael Valentin, a retired city detective who worked at ground zero. ""It breaks my heart for the families who have to put up with this. I understand they're [building] it in a respectful way, but it just shouldn't be down there."" Others such as Barry Zelman said the site's location will be a painful reminder. ""(The 9/11 terrorists) did this in the name of Islam,"" Zelman said. ""It's a sacred ground where these people died, where my brother was murdered, and to be in the shadows of that religion, it's just hypocritical and sacrilegious. "" But Marvin Bethea, who was a paramedic at ground zero, said it was ""the right thing to do."" ""I lost 16 friends down there. But Muslims also got killed on 9/11. It would be a good sign of faith that we're not condemning all Muslims and that the Muslims who did this happened to be extremists,"" he said. ""As a black man, I know what it's like to be discriminated against when you haven't done anything.""

"Facebook is helping to roll out a pilot online education program in Rwanda, as part of its pitch to bring internet to the unconnected world. Dubbed SocialEDU, the new initiative was revealed at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Monday and comes the same day as the social media giant's founder Mark Zuckerberg gives a keynote speech at the event. As part of the SocialEDU pilot program, EdX will work with Facebook to create an educational app to provide localized education. This Facebook integrated app is being released under the umbrella of Internet.org, the partnership between Facebook and mobile companies to bring internet to those without access. The deal, which will initially be offered to university students, has been done in partnership with telecommunications giant Airtel, which is providing free educational data for a year to those who sign up and Nokia, which is offering discounted smartphones to those participating. The Rwanda government is also set to expand its free wifi in campuses and will adapt edX course materials locally. SocialEDU students will receive access to education from universities such as Harvard, MIT, Berkeley and others. The program allows users to interact with each other and with teachers. Facebook's Chris Weasler, director of global connectivity, said the partnerships were able to ""create a new type of educational experience that's affordable and social."" It is hoped the pilot, if successful, will be expanded beyond Rwanda. The deal is revealed as focus at the huge mobile trade fair turns to Zuckerberg, who is making his first appearance at the event and is due to take the stage at 1800 CET/1300 ET. The famously reticent speaker's appearance at the congress is being seen as a signal Facebook is set to put mobile first  -- as witnessed by the $19 billion purchase of WhatsApp, a mobile messaging service, last week. Facebook paid 19 times more for WhatsApp than it did for Instagram, despite the app's low profile in the United States. Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would continue to operate independently of Facebook, saying at the time: ""The product roadmap will remain unchanged and the team is going to stay in Mountain View,"" the suburban California city where it's based. Days after the deal, WhatsApp suffered an outage, going down for more than three hours on Saturday. On Monday Zuckerberg is expected to face embarrassing questions over the glitch.","Facebook is helping roll out a pilot online education program in Rwanda, under the Internet.org umbrella .

"The Clintons left the White House more than a dozen years ago ""dead broke"" and in debt, according to Hillary Clinton, who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year. In a wide-ranging interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that aired on Monday, the former secretary of state also said that the deadly 2012 terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya,  would give her ""more of a reason to run"" for president again than a rationale for not doing so. The interview comes just as Clinton's new book, ""Hard Choices,"" about her years as Barack Obama's first secretary of state hits bookstores on Tuesday. It's the latest look at her storied career in the global spotlight as first lady, U.S. senator, presidential candidate and top diplomat. She made headlines in a clip of the interview that aired on ""Good Morning America"" in which she defended her hefty speaking fees, noting that she knew what it was like to experience tough financial circumstances in the winter of 2001. She said her family ""came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt,"" adding later that her family had ""no money"" at that time and ""struggled to piece together the resources"" for mortgages and her daughter Chelsea's college education. ""You know, it was not easy,"" she said. The Clintons departed the White House in debt due to enormous legal fees. By the end of 2000, their debt totaled somewhere between $2.28 million to $10.6 million. But former presidents and first ladies have the ability to make a lot of money, and the Clintons were no exception and have done so. Their assets grew quickly. Bill Clinton made more than $9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $9.5 million in 2002. They paid off their legal fees by 2004. A CNN analysis of the family's financial records in early 2013 showed that Bill Clinton had earned $106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind. In 2012 alone, he earned $17 million in fees. Although she regularly speaks for free at certain events, Mother Jones reported earlier this year that Clinton made roughly $5 million on the speaking circuit since stepping down as America's top diplomat. Clinton did not dispute the figure when Sawyer asked about it. Though not as profitable as her husband - who has made as much as $750,000 in one speech - Hillary Clinton reportedly commands $200,000 per speech. The two also have received hefty advances for their books. Hillary Clinton said the former first family eventually turned around their finances, noting that her husband has ""worked really hard and it has been amazing to me."" She noted that they had to pay off debts, get their houses arranged and ""take care of family members."" Clinton has become a staple on the paid speaking circuit. She has appeared before an array of audiences, including trade associations, business groups and college students. Asked if she thought Americans could understand making ""five times the median income in this country for one speech,"" Clinton said she ""thought making speeches for money was a much better thing than getting connected with any one group or company as so many people who leave public life do."" American Rising, the pro-Republican opposition research shop that along with the Republican National Committee, takes the lead in criticizing Clinton, was quick to ping her over her comments to ABC, saying they ""reveal someone who is extremely out of touch with financial reality facing Americans."" On its website, America Rising said the two homes the Clintons purchased after leaving the White House in Chappaqua, New York, and Washington cost around $4.5 million combined. On Benghazi, Republicans contend that the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and four Americans illustrates Obama administration foreign policy failures. Democrats say ongoing Republican-led scrutiny is political and designed to undercut any potential Clinton candidacy. ""I view this as really apart from - even a diversion from - the hard work that the Congress should be doing about the problems facing our country and the world,"" Clinton said, noting that the United States should be ""in the majors"" on world affairs. Clinton has taken responsibility for the attack in the past and she did so again in the clip released by ABC. But in this interview, Clinton defended herself by saying she ""was not making security decisions"" for the Benghazi compound. ""Well, I certainly would give anything on earth if this had not happened,"" Clinton said. ""And I certainly would wish that we had made some of the changes that came to our attention to make as a result of the investigation. But I also am clear in my own mind that we had a system and that system, of course, ended with me.""","The former secretary of state reportedly has made $5 million in speaking fees since leaving government .

"It is a tale of tragedy meets election-year politics. As the nation reels from yet another mass murder, in which the killer shot some of his victims before taking his own life, two rival proposals aimed at improving mental health -- and supporters hope curbing mass gun violence by extension -- are before congressional lawmakers. A measure sponsored by Rep. Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania Republican and clinical psychologist, seeks to get states to revise standards for committing the severely mentally ill to hospitals. His bill, which has bipartisan support, also includes a controversial proposal that seeks to empower families and judges to intervene on behalf of severely mentally ill adults and, in some cases, compel court-ordered therapy and medication. Murphy's effort would also significantly dial back federal funding to the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which spends more than $3 billion annually on care and is an agency that Murphy does not think is effective. His bill has the backing of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Sheriffs' Association, among other groups. On Thursday, he will also outline before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee the results of his yearlong look into federal mental health programs -- an investigation sparked by the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Can Mental Health Bill Help Stop Mass Killings? Treading carefully on guns . ""The privacy laws were to prevent mistreatment from health care ... not meant to keep people from being treated in health care,"" Murphy said on CNN's New Day on Wednesday . He added that in many of the recent mass shootings, the parents were aware of the gunman's mental health issues but were legally powerless. ""People knew when something was going on. What about the rights of society? When someone says 'we don't want you forcing them into treatment,' look, I get that,"" Murphy said. ""But society is saying when the signs are there, that someone is gravely disabled or gravely ill from mental illness, a brain illness, treat them. Denial is not a treatment."" A competing measure from Rep. Ron Barber, a politically vulnerable Arizona Democrat struck by gunfire when his former boss, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot and severely wounded in 2011, also takes a mental health approach. His legislation would more broadly improve mental health care through added federal financial assistance for counseling, research and education efforts. Stage set for partisan fight . His measure has the seal of approval from a number of organizations, including the National Association of School Psychologists, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and Mental Health America. ""We know that one of every four Americans will have a mental illness at least once in their lifetime. Investing in mental health services in our communities and early identification and prevention of mental illness will save both lives and money,"" Barber said in a statement on his Web page. The pending showdown over the two measures -- neither of which directly addresses the type of mass gun violence that ended lives in Santa Barbara, Newtown and so many other cities -- sets the stage for a partisan fight over overhauling the nation's mental health system. ""It's not what's in their hands, it's what is in their mind and heart that we've got to deal with,"" Murphy said on ""New Day."" ""California has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation bar none. And so it didn't work there."" Tackling mental health and gun policy is a thorny issue, but one that needs to be addressed, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told The Washington Post this week. ""We've got to look at how we define mental illness, who is denied weapons and who is not, and focus the discussion,"" King, who has pushed for tougher firearms measures, told the paper. ""We have to have this debate."" Initiatives focusing on mental health were among the nearly two dozen executive actions put in place by the White House after Newtown. Young, angry and socially alienated . The debate will unfold as the nation digests the actions of  Elliot Rodger, 22, a former Santa Barbara City College student who police say fatally stabbed three people and shot three others in that city before taking his own life, Friday. His parents had alerted authorities to their son's mental illness and signs, they say, pointed to the danger he might one day pose. And, as has happened after Columbine, Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, Tucson, Aurora, Newtown, Washington and other shootings in other places, the victims' families and neighbors plead for justice, for an end to gun violence, for a change in laws. ""What, what has changed? Have we learned nothing? Where the hell is the leadership,"" a weeping Richard Martinez, whose son, Christopher, a University of California Santa Barbara college student who was shot by Rodger, told CNN. ""My kid died because nobody responded to what happened at Sandy Hook."" Father of shooting victim chastises politicians, demands new gun laws . In what has become part of a familiar ritual following mass shootings in America, advocates call for action and politicos, especially those in Washington, project solemnity before retreating to their respective corners of the intractable gun debate. ""Shame on us for allowing this to continue,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who championed firearms reforms that failed in Congress following Newtown. Dems also weigh gun bill . In another effort, House Democratic leaders said Wednesday they were weighing whether to push an amendment to a spending bill aimed at strengthening background checks for gun buyers. But they acknowledged it would likely prove unsuccessful. The White House is also pushing to fund gun violence prevention studies for the first time in roughly 20 years, an effort resisted by Republican critics who accuse the Obama administration of playing politics with taxpayer funds. Political experts say there's little visibility on the issue, even if the conversation centers on mental health, which has routinely presented itself in the roster of America's mass shootings. As details emerged over the weekend in California, Rodger's history of mental health issues apparently was no secret to his family. A family friend said he had seen therapists since childhood. The public push for reforms is fickle and is largely influenced by moment-to-moment tragedy, said Cedric Alexander, the chief of police for DeKalb County, Georgia, a clinical psychologist and adviser to the pro-gun rights group Independent Firearm Owners Association. ""Our attention span is so short we never focus on this complicated problem long enough to address the problem, let alone begin to fix it,"" Alexander said in a statement. Support for gun control has hit peaks and valleys since 1993. That's when the Brady Bill came about after the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan and established a federal background check program for gun purchases. According to a  CNN/ORC International survey conducted in December, 49% of Americans said they supported stricter gun control laws, while 50% opposed them. That fell from the 55% who backed tougher measures a few weeks after the Newtown shootings. States take the lead . Stymied federal legislative actions have sent advocates for stricter controls looking for new ways to have an impact. The gun control fights have now moved to the states where legislatures have weighed more than 1,000 proposals, according to an analysis by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The battle over gun policy: Old fight, new strategies . And according to data collected for CNN by the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than half of the nation's legislatures -- those dominated by Republicans -- weighed bills that would have nullified any federal ban on military style assault weapons and limits on large magazines. Will states go where Congress hasn't on gun laws? A number of measures at the state level deal with mental health. In South Dakota, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill requiring that mental health records of ""someone acquitted of a crime by reason of insanity"" be sent to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. According to data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, roughly 1% of gun permit applicants who failed to pass a background check over the past 14 years, or 10,180 people, were denied for reasons related to mental health.","Lawmakers have two bills tackling mental health in aftermath of Santa Barbara shooting .

"He grew up a child of two nations -- the United States and Pakistan -- with a parent from each. He was born Daood Gilani, the son of a prominent Pakistani broadcaster, but in 2006 he changed his name to David Headley. In a federal courtroom in Chicago on Thursday, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison for his role in the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, India, that killed 164 people, including six U.S. citizens. Headley has admitted conducting advance surveillance for the operation in India. Although Headley, 52, was facing up to life in prison, the Justice Department recommended that the judge sentence him to the term he eventually got after the defendant cooperated with U.S. authorities. Prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty in exchange for his plea on terrorism charges. He signed that agreement in 2010 and promised to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Attorney General Eric Holder noted at the time that he had provided extensive ""valuable intelligence about terrorist activities."" Name change helped facilitate the surveillance in India . Headley was arrested by federal agents on October 2009 in Chicago, accused of helping plan terror attacks against a Danish newspaper that ran cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, sparking Muslim anger worldwide. He was later linked to the bloody four-day terrorist siege in Mumbai. Headley cooperated with the authorities investigating both terror plots. Headley received a Social Security number in Pennsylvania sometime in the late 1970s, public records show. He changed his name from Daood Gilani to David Headley on or about February 15, 2006, in Philadelphia in order to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani, according to a criminal complaint against him. The Justice Department also accused him of attending terrorism training camps in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003, and working with the group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to carry out terror attacks. The United States lists Lashkar as a terrorist organization. India blamed the group for the Mumbai attacks. Terror testimony . Headley testified against a Canadian man who was sentenced last week to 14 years in prison for aiding a plot to attack the Danish paper. Gary Shapiro, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago, issued a lengthy sentencing memo to the federal district court on Tuesday concluding that the 30- to 35-year sentence the government recommended for Headley was fair. ""While his criminal conduct was deplorable, the uniquely significant cooperation which he provided to the government's efforts to combat terrorism support the government's recommendations,"" Shapiro said. The Indian government wants to conduct another trial for Headley, but the United States has said it would not send him to any other country.

"(CNN)While the New Jersey governor's unusual adoration of the Dallas Cowboys has been well documented, Chris Christie's loyalty for America's team was on full display Sunday night when he was seen giving Cowboys owner Jerry Jones a bear hug after the team made a huge comeback to defeat the Detroit Lions. His embrace quickly spread via social media, drawing detractors and defenders alike for the governor's NFL preference. As for the ribbing he got online, Christie said Monday morning that nobody was giving him a hard time until the Cowboys started doing welâ€‹l. ""I would take all the abuse that I'm taking from some of these folks in return for Cowboys playoff wins,"" Christie said on WFAN's ""Boomer & Carton"" radio show, where he does regular call-in interviews. The Republican described the celebratory mood in Jones' box as ""pandemonium"" after the game. The locker room, he added, was also ecstatic, and he recalled being hugged by wide receiver Dez Bryant. Asked about the orange sweater he wore to the game, Christie said it was a good luck charm, one that he's sported to every game he's been to this year. ""And They've won all five,"" he said. Christie defended his longtime, out-of-state loyalty, saying ""you are who you are as a fan,"" adding that he's also remained a New York Rangers fan in the NHL rather than a New Jersey Devils fan."" He said he hopes to go to the Cowboys playoff game next weekend against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in Wisconsin. Asked if he'll pay a visit to Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 rival for the GOP presidential nomination, while he's there, Christie said: ""Of course. Scott and I are friends, and I'll see Scott."" The New Jersey native has long been clear about his professional football allegiance, saying it dates back to when he was fascinated by quarterback Roger Staubach as a kid. Christie said in 2013 that his father was a Giants fan -- ""Every Sunday, he'd watch the Giants and yell at the TV set"" -- and part of his own motivation for favoring the Cowboys stemmed from watching his dad get so upset on game days. ""I used to think to myself, why do I want to root for a team that makes you angry? So I decided not to."" More recently in a late December interview, Christie was grilled by New Jersey reporter Steve Adubato about appearances with Jones in the Dallas Cowboys owners' box. ""What is the deal?"" Adubato demanded during his hour-long interview with Christie shortly before Christmas. Christie defended his loyalty to the Cowboys as a badge of honor: ""You don't change your sports teams. You know? So that's who I am.""  His brother, Todd Christie, also came to his defense on Sunday night, writing in a fiery Facebook post: ""To all of those non Cowboy fans who have their panties in a ringer because the Governor of NJ is a Cowboys fan---GET A LIFE !!!"" While Christie acknowledges it's politically incorrect to be a Cowboys fan in New Jersey, it could be a smart move in the Garden State, which technically doesn't have an NFL team. Choosing one of the New York teams might not win him many friends in the southern part of the state, close to the Philadelphia Eagles -- and vice versa. Regardless of his sports affiliations, Christie's friendship with Jones -- which he said developed over the past five years -- could be a valuable asset to the New Jersey governor if he runs for president in 2016. More importantly, Christie's friendship with Jones could help widen his donor network in a state where both Perry and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- two potential competitors -- have deep ties to many wealthy contributors across the state. Jones has been a generous contributor to Texas Gov. Rick Perry over the years, and also contributed to 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney's presidential campaign early in the cycle. Asked if he thinks he can carry Texas now if he runs for president, Christie joked on the radio show Monday: ""I think our chances have improved."" Still, Christie has caught flack for his NFL choice. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell said last month that Christie's unapologetic love for the Cowboys is ""pathetic"" and rooted in a ""basic inferiority complex."" ""If you are a Jerseyite or a Pennsylvanian and you're rooting for the Cowboys, it means you're not secure in yourself and you wanted to root for a team that was a team in your youth that was a constant winner,"" the Philadelphia Eagles fan said Thursday on a radio show. He was booed by some of the children in the crowd at a central New Jersey elementary school during his 2013 gubernatorial campaign when he admitted the Cowboys were his favorite team.  Before revealing that choice, he warned the audience that his answer often ""gets all my political advisers nervous."" Christie's favorite basketball team, the New York Knicks, drew a more favorable response from the elementary school audience. When he named his favorite baseball team, the New York Mets, he got some heat from the young Yankees fans in the crowd. But some came to his defense Sunday night, including former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe, who tweeted that it ""takes guts"" for someone to stand by their team.","New Jersey Gov.

"Ever wished you could clamber aboard your cumbersome luggage to zoom down a hill or coast through an airport? Driven by the same desire, Slovenian frequent flier Bostjan Zagar has come up with the answer -- a foot-powered scooter-suitcase known as Olaf. ""The idea comes from having to catch the next connection flight in three minutes when the gate is on the other side of the world and you need to move faster than those moving walkways,"" Zagar tells CNN. Disappointed with available luggage solutions to this problem, Zagar used his background as an automotive engineer and his time waiting for flights to sketch up an alternative. Now, after three years of ""testing, testing, testing,"" and a soon-to-finish fundraising campaign on Kickstarter, the Olaf is ready to hit the streets. It's available in three models: an airline-approved carry-on suitcase with a built-in kick scooter; a backpack with kick scooter and a kick scooter that can carry another bag. All three feature wheely suitcase-style collapsible handles and can double up as a hand trolleys. 'Hardcore engineering' Zagar, who describes himself as a ""hardcore engineering guy,"" says he grew up preferring scooters to skateboards because he liked being able to control the speed. Needless to say, his suitcase scooters are all fitted with brakes. Even with this sensible feature, Zagar says travelers in some parts of the world may be wary to step aboard. ""What we learned is the typical reaction in Europe was 'oh cool, I want to have one, but how will I look? People are staring at me.' ""This is the problem in Europe, people don't want to stand out from the crowd. For sure, it's not for the shy ones."" Olaf clearly has considerable appeal though. With the final hours ticking down, Ljubljana-based Olaf's Kickstarter campaign has raised well in excess of its $27,000 target. The scooter-suitcase, it seems, is already on a roll.","Slovenian frequent flier Bostjan Zagar's Olaf suitcase can also be ridden as a scooter .

"(CNN) -- Colombia and the United States signed an agreement Friday that allows U.S. personnel to be stationed at seven military bases in the South American nation. The United States says it needs the bases to help in its fight against terrorists and narcotraffickers, especially since the closure a few months ago of a U.S. base in Ecuador. The United States maintains similar ""forward operating locations"" in El Salvador and Aruba-Curacao. Colombia's agreement to host the Americans has come under harsh criticism in Latin America, particularly from President Hugo Chavez in neighboring Venezuela. Chavez has likened the agreement to an act of war and accuses the United States of wanting to stage military personnel nearby to destabilize his leftist government. The U.S. forward operating location in Aruba-Curacao is off the northern coast of Venezuela. The United States linked Colombia's agreement to a trade pact the South American nation wants. Colombia also stands to gain from U.S. help in the nation's 45-year-old war against Marxist guerrillas known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly called FARC. Colombian Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez, Defense Minister Gabriel Silva and Interior and Justice Minister Fabio Valencia Cossio were joined by U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield in signing the document Friday in Bogota, the nation's capital.","U.S. military personnel may be stationed at seven Colombian bases .

"You might have been forgiven for not knowing there is an election around Europe, starting on Thursday, to elect 751 members of the European Parliament, known as MEPs. You are not forgiven. There are 751 seats from 28 countries up for grabs. Nearly 400 million Europeans are eligible to vote. Extreme parties on the left, and more noticeable, on the right, are expected to poll very well. It seems the angry are most likely to make the effort to vote, from Dublin to Athens. The European Parliament gained more power in the Lisbon Treaty. It certainly does not have the legislative power of a national parliament, but it has the power to pressure Brussels. In theory it even has the power to ""elect"" the next European Commission president (though heads of state/government can also ignore who parliament chooses. Isn't Europe fun?). During the last vote, in 2009, the United Kingdom Independence Party came in second to the now ruling Conservative Party -- both parties are full of euroskeptics -- and UKIP became a force in British politics. If you believe polls, UKIP could come in first in Thursday's vote. The difference this time around is that the party has been under heavy scrutiny about his anti-immigration stance, about its controversial leader Nigel Farage and about its desire for the UK to actually pull out of the EU -- which of course would put its MEPs out of work. That's because UKIP does not have one single seat in Westminster, the UK's national parliament. But UKIP is tapping into a feeling that is also benefiting parties on the extreme left -- that Brussels has lost its way. While rightist parties want to cut EU budgets, cut its influence, or simply cut it all up and throw it away, those on the left have been pushing hard to end the austerity drive driven by Brussels. They want to see spending to cut Europe's biggest disease: unemployment. Both extremes are benefiting from drag on Europe following the economic crisis which was followed by the Great Recession. Europeans are sick of it all and have every right to express their displeasure through the ballot box. So, will it make a difference? Yes, but maybe not in obvious ways. The bigger the vote for the extremes, the more likely the middle parties will have to work together to form a voting bloc. Giles Moec of Deutsche Bank calls it the ""big soft"" center. The second influence by the fringe parties will be how far they push national governments to the left or the right, depending. Some ruling parties have already embraced their left party's call to end austerity and spend their way back to health. Other ruling parties have talked about cracking down on immigrants and other bogeymen, real or imagined. So, the rise of the fringe can influence Europe for the next five years simply by being who they are and making their voice at every turn, even if they can't really vote as a bloc. You see, if there is one thing the fringe have in common in Europe, they are far from united. Every time one of them sticks their foot into it, the others have to at least pretend to be aghast and to pull away. The more seats the rightest parties gain from next week, the more likely the battle between Marine Le Pen of the France's National Front and Farage of UKIP for dominance will split the base. No unity from the right is expected. Now, if I am wrong and the right can form a useable bloc to block Brussels at every turn, then the European elections will prove to have been more important than most people could ever imagine.

"Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett announced plans Wednesday to file an anti-trust lawsuit against the NCAA over its sanctions against Penn State University following the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal. Last July, the NCAA levied unprecedented sanctions against the university, including a fine of $60 million. It also stripped 14 seasons of football victories from late head coach Joe Paterno. ""These sanctions did not punish Sandusky,"" or those who allegedly helped cover up his repeated sexual abuse of disadvantaged children, said Corbett at a news conference in State College. He said they instead affect past and current students who were not part of the scandal. ""I cannot and will not let it happen without a fight,"" said Corbett, adding that the Sandusky case was a criminal matter and not a violation of NCAA rules. Corbett also called a university-funded review of the scandal led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh an incomplete report. Freeh's 267-page review was released in July and blamed former university president Graham Spanier, Paterno, suspended Athletic Director Tim Curley and ex-Vice President Gary Schultz for allegedly taking part in a cover-up to avoid bad publicity. Do sanctions alter history books on Penn State? The scandal led to Spanier's ouster and shocked the nation after Freeh's team concluded that the school's top administrators had ""empowered"" Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for the football team, to continue his abuse. The NCAA said in a statement Wednesday it was disappointed by the governor's action. ""Not only does this forthcoming lawsuit appear to be without merit, it is an affront to all of the victims in this tragedy -- lives that were destroyed by the criminal actions of Jerry Sandusky,"" said Donald M. Remy, NCAA executive vice president and general counsel. ""While the innocence that was stolen can never be restored, Penn State has accepted the consequences for its role and the role of its employees and is moving forward. Today's announcement by the governor is a setback to the university's efforts."" Penn State also issued a statement Wednesday saying it remained ""committed to full compliance with the Consent Decree, the Athletics Integrity Agreement and, as appropriate, the implementation of the Freeh report recommendations."" School faced 4-year 'death penalty' The fine is expected to be paid over five years and will fund an endowment with a mission of fighting child sex abuse and supporting victims. Pennsylvania's U.S. House delegation objects to the NCAA's plans to spend only 25% of those funds within the state. The delegation wants the association to spend all of the $60 million in Pennsylvania, according to a November letter to the NCAA. ""While we fully support the stated purpose of the endowment, we believe its funds should be used solely for programs and organizations within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where a need exists for the creation of prevention programs for sexually abused children,"" the letter stated. Sandusky, 68, was convicted last June on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less-than-two-week trial. In October, he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, meaning he'll likely die behind bars. Penn State alum: We deserved NCAA penalty . Penn State, a college football powerhouse and two-time national champion, avoided the NCAA's ""death penalty,"" a suspension from play of a year or more, in the Sandusky abuse case. But Ed Ray, the chairman of the NCAA's executive committee, said the sanctions on the school ""should serve as a stark wake-up call to everyone in college sports."" Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the university accepted the decision and would not appeal. ""I think, for the whole university, what this calls upon us to do is to look at our whole value culture, our whole value set, our value base,"" Erickson told CNN last year. Paterno, who coached at Penn State for 46 years, was fired after Sandusky's arrest in November 2011.  He had been the all-time leader in major college football victories for a coach, with 409 wins. The NCAA's decision strikes 111 of those from his record, beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumps him from the top of the list. Last July, the Big Ten Conference declared Penn State ineligible for any conference title football games and ruled that the Nittany Lions' share of bowl revenues for four seasons -- about $13 million -- will be donated to charities that ""protect children."" David La Torre, a Penn State spokesman, said last year the school will not use tax or tuition dollars to pay the NCAA's $60 million fine. Paterno loyalists call NCAA sanctions excessive .","Gov.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman managed to keep his Senate committee chairmanship in part because President-elect Barack Obama didn't want to punish him for supporting Sen. John McCain, Lieberman said Tuesday. Sen. Joe Lieberman speaks Tuesday after Democrats allowed him to keep his committee chairmanship. The Senate Democratic caucus, following a lengthy and often heated debate, voted 42-13 Tuesday to let Lieberman continue chairing the Senate Homeland Security Committee. The caucus did, however, strip Lieberman of his spot on the Environment and Public Works Committee. A Democrat in the Senate for 18 years before going independent, Lieberman criticized Obama, the Democratic nominee, during the race for the White House. ""I know that my colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus were moved not only that Sen. [Harry] Reid said about my longtime record, but by the appeal from President-elect Obama himself that the nation unite now to confront our very serious problems,"" Lieberman said in the Capitol as those colleagues nodded in agreement behind him.  Watch Lieberman express regrets over past statements » . Democrats were angered by Lieberman's speech to the Republican National Convention, where he praised his longtime friend McCain and criticized Obama for not reaching across the aisle to work with Republicans during his time in the Senate. Reid, the Senate majority leader, said Lieberman's criticism of the Democratic nominee had angered him. ""I would defy anyone to be more angry than I was,"" he said Tuesday. ""But I also believe that if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time we walk out of here saying, 'Boy did we get even'?"" Obama urged Reid privately to let bygones be bygones, sources said. Reid dismissed vehement criticism of the decision from elements of the party's more liberal base, which insisted Lieberman be punished. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Senate's other independent who regularly caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN's Dana Bash he was one of the 13 who voted against Lieberman because while millions of people worked hard for Obama, Lieberman actively worked for four more years of President Bush's policies. But Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, one of four Democrats who proposed the motion to allow Lieberman to keep his chairmanship, said the caucus decided that it could forgive if Obama could. ""If Barack can move on, so can we,"" Carper said. Lieberman, of Connecticut, and Sanders consistently vote on most issues with the Democrats, who hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate including them. Democrats picked up six more seats in the election two weeks ago. Three more still are being contested in Alaska, Georgia and Minnesota. Winning those three seats and counting Lieberman and Sanders could give Democrats a 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority, which would allow them to advance legislation at will and prevent Republicans from blocking it from getting to the floor. After serving three terms as a Democrat, Lieberman lost Connecticut's Democratic 2006 primary to Ned Lamont, who was helped by bloggers and others angered by Lieberman's support for the Iraq war. But Lieberman ran in the general election as an independent and was re-elected. Lieberman was the Democrats' 2000 vice presidential nominee, running with Al Gore. Along with McCain, Lieberman co-sponsored the 2002 resolution that authorized the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has resisted removing troops. On the campaign trail with McCain this year, Lieberman strongly defended the Republican presidential nominee's call for staying the course in Iraq. He endorsed McCain's bid in December 2007 before the first nominating contest of this year's election cycle. Before the convention speech, Lieberman angered Democrats when he said Obama was choosing to lose the Iraq war by planning to withdraw American combat troops. ""If Barack Obama's policy in Iraq had been implemented, he couldn't be in Iraq today,"" Lieberman said, referring to a trip Obama was about to make to Iraq. Lieberman added that Obama ""was prepared to accept retreat and defeat."" CNN's Dana Bash, Ted Barrett, Evan Glass, John Helton and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Democrats vote to let Sen. Lieberman keep top Homeland Security Committee post .

"The French government has thrown down the gauntlet to the jihadists of Ansar Dine and their fellow travelers in Mali -- and insists its goal is nothing short of eradicating these militant groups. It is a major undertaking, even with U.S. logistical and intelligence help and the prospect of reinforcement from African states. And the outcome is far from assured. Operation Serval seeks to push Islamist groups out of northern Mali's key cities as well as smaller towns dotted through this vast region. But these groups have had nine months to establish defenses and a chain of command and improve their arsenals. As I found out last summer on a journey north from the capital, Bamako, into the dusty heartlands of Mali, the seizure of the north by Islamist groups has traumatized tens of thousands of civilians. Many have fled their homes; others have endured hunger or cruel punishment for ""offenses"" that didn't exist before the Islamists arrived. So ordinary Malians are welcoming the French intervention. But their enthusiasm may wear off, if the result is prolonged urban warfare and destruction. On my trip up the RN15 last June, one of the few roads in Mali worthy of the description, I met Mohammed al-Mahmoud, a noted Tuareg artisan from Timbuktu.  At that point, Mali's security forces had melted away in the face of the Islamists' advance. Al-Mahmoud told me he had seen no vestige of the state in Konna, a town of some 50,000 people, contradicting the assertion of a high-ranking military officer who assured me his forces were deployed there  -- precisely to deter a possible push southward by the Islamists. In reality, Konna was in the middle of an ungoverned buffer-zone rather than a well-guarded front-line town.  And it stayed that way for months, perhaps lulling foreign governments and even the Malian army into a false sense of security. That is until last week, when militants of Ansar Dine made a sudden move southward to take the town and get within striking distance of the important town of Mopti and the airport at Sévaré. That provoked the immediate arrival of French air and ground forces in Mali to help local troops push back the advancing jihadis. Over the weekend Mirage warplanes launched sorties against Léré, near the border with Mauritania, as well as the key hub of Gao and the town of Douentza. Now French armored personnel carriers are heading north from Bamako. The United Kingdom is pledging to help the transport of troops from neighboring African states, and the United States will employ its vast technical capabilities to assist in the overall operations. But France will be the essential external actor in the conflict. Mali's meltdown began in mid-January of last year when the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), an ethnic Tuareg separatist outfit, and Ansar Dine, a newly formed Salafi-jihadi group, attacked the northeastern town of Menaka. Following a succession of lighting raids by heavily armed rebel groups in late March 2012, Malian security forces evacuated three northern regions: Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal. Mali's army, national police and paramilitary gendarme force, who had been stationed in the north, relocated to the safety of garrisons and cinder-block station houses south of a rapidly created front line. And for a while the disparate rebel movements worked together in an ad hoc alliance despite their very different ideologies and goals. But before long the highly divergent agendas of Ansar Dine and the MNLA led to clashes between them. Ansar Dine is led by a Tuareg by the name of Iyad ag Ghaly -- a veteran separatist-turned-Islamist. The jihadists prevailed. However, Ghaly's Ansar Dine is just one of three Salafi-jihadi groups in northern Mali. His turban-clad men were soon joined by the Saharan contingent of the Algerian-led al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and another hitherto unknown group, the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), believed to be run by a Mauritanian national named Hamada Ould Khairou. On December 7, 2012, the U.S. State Department listed Khairou as a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist."" The loss of the north -- and resentment among army officers that they were inadequately equipped to fight the rebellion -- led to a coup against the democratically elected President, Amadou Toumani Touré.  He was overthrown by a military junta led by an obscure army captain Amadou Sanogo, who accused him of appeasement when dealing with AQIM and Tuareg separatists. The well-armed Islamist groups may have decided not to advance further south after their initial seizure of territory because they were occupied in consolidating their power in the areas already under their control. A fragile status quo left the international community with the illusion that there was sufficient time to plan for military action, while leaving room for negotiations that might lead to a political solution. The French were the most bullish in supporting military intervention by ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States), but the scale of the task was recognized as enormous. The Malian military was low on morale and equipment, the distances vast and the territory difficult. Mali's neighbors dithered with their own military planning as a series of fruitless, drawn-out talks with various rebel factions were led by Blaise Compaoré, Burkina Faso's longtime president and his foreign minister, Djibril Bassolé. President Compaoré, a one-time confidant of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has a reputation for meddling in the affairs of his West African neighbors, including past conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Ivory Coast. Much to the consternation of pro-junta Malian hardliners, Burkina Faso invited the rebels to talks at a plush Ouagadougou hotel and  sent a high-level delegation to Gao and Kidal led by Bassolé. Cheikh Modibo Diarra, the recently ousted transitional prime minister in Mali (and former NASA scientist) said in November that he was open to talks in Burkina Faso with both the MNLA and the jihadists of Ansar Dine on the condition that they were Malian citizens with a purely Malian agenda. Soon thereafter, he lost his job -- once again displaying the complete dysfunction of Malian politics. It seems Diarra's initiative ran afoul Captain Sanogo, who wields considerable influence despite formally handing over to a civilian president. On December 20, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 2085 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, allowing for the eventual creation and deployment of international troops in Mali. The UN allowed for the creation of African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA) in concert with ECOWAS and the African Union. Members of the international community hoped for certain benchmarks to be met among Mali's political elites and the military junta that still wields considerable power. But it seems Ansar Dine and MUJAO were operating on their own strategic timetable, catching many off guard -- including civilians who were forced to flee the fighting. The U.S. has watched the deteriorating situation in Mali with concern -- but with no appetite for direct intervention. After the September attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seemed to suggest that there may have been a link between AQIM operating freely in Mali's ungoverned spaces and the tragedy in eastern Libya. ""They [AQIM] are working with other violent extremists to undermine the democratic transitions under way in North Africa, as we tragically saw in Benghazi,"" she said. But it's been difficult to stitch together a coalition of African countries willing or able to go to war on behalf of Mali's weak civilian government. Many of Mali's neighbors were rightly concerned about the prospect of a wider regional conflict and the risk of terrorist blowback at home. And they were concerned that a substantial part of Mali's population might not welcome them. These are not states with well-trained Rapid Reaction Forces, nor the airlift or support to inject a sizeable presence into hostile territory. But now at least seven west African countries are ready to supply troops to a regional intervention force. The two principle hawks on Mali have been French President Francois Hollande and Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou (who's offering soldiers to the ECOWAS force), two leaders who believe they may have the most to lose, should Mali's conflict worsen. France still has a number of hostages in northern Mali, including four of its citizens captured by Mali-based militants in neighboring Niger in 2010 while working for Areva, the French uranium mining consortium. AQIM has been holding the men as bargaining chips and could potentially execute them in response to the French intervention. In Niger, President Issoufou fears armed conflict (and a tide of refugees) could spill into the country's northern regions and re-ignite its own Tuareg troubles. Despite the relatively small number of militant fighters, there is little simple about the French operation. The distances are huge, the geography difficult, and the risk of neighboring countries being dragged into Mali's crisis cannot be discounted. The French defense minister has acknowledged that the militants are a determined adversary that is well equipped. It will take more than a few air strikes to dislodge them.","Operation Serval seeks to push Islamist groups out of northern Mali's key cities .

"Washington (CNN)Mike Huckabee's announcement on Saturday to end his Fox News show marked yet another significant move by a key player in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, bringing the 2016 contest further into focus as a deep bench of prospective candidates begins to test the waters. The former Arkansas governor said Saturday night's episode of ""Huckabee"" would be his last. It was a necessary step, he said, as he explores a second presidential bid, a decision he stressed he won't finalize until the spring. ""I say goodbye, but as we say in television, stay tuned. There's more to come,"" he said at the end of his show. His announcement comes nearly three weeks after former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announced he will ""actively explore"" a possible run. A source close to Huckabee's political operation said the decision to leave Fox has been long in the works and argued Bush's timing had ""zero"" impact on Huckabee's strategy. Huckabee is set to take another typical pre-presidential step when he releases his book ""God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,"" on Jan. 20. His promotional tour is already scheduled to take him to Iowa, Tennessee, New York and Virginia. The Iowa book signing takes place one day after he is scheduled to appear at a Jan. 24 Des Moines event, hosted by Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, and Citizens United, a conservative nonprofit based in Washington. All told, the former governor will make 30 stops in 10 states over 10 days for his book tour, according to the source, including visits to the early primary state of South Carolina, in addition to Iowa. His website says he's also leading a group of people to Israel in February. Israel is a common stop for prospective presidential candidates, though it's a trip he's also made in the past. Huckabee rocketed to conservative fame in early January 2008 after he went from a long-shot candidate to the surprise victor of Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses. The win catapulted him into a fairly competitive race against Sen. John McCain, but the Arizona senator surged ahead and clinched the nomination in early March 2008. Three years later, Huckabee considered another run but ultimately declined to throw his hat in the ring, announcing his decision on his show in May 2011. With Huckabee back in the spotlight as a serious prospective candidate and with his television show no longer a distraction, his focus will shift toward securing the financial footing that he lacked in 2008 to sustain a prolonged campaign. ""If he decides to run this time, I think that's something we will be able to remedy,"" the source said. ""It's one of the things that he learned eight years ago: make sure you have the financial resources to compete."" In fact, Huckabee spent a considerable amount of time on the campaign trail last year, rubbing elbows with donors and activists as he made multiples stops to each of the three early primary states to help 2014 candidates and speak at conservative and evangelical gatherings. He has consistently done well in polls measuring support for the potential 2016 GOP field, ranking higher in many cases than other possible candidates who made more ambitious hints at a presidential run in the past year. A recent CNN/ORC poll showed Huckabee tied for fourth place with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, with 6% support in the hypothetical GOP horse race. Bush topped the list at 23%, followed by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 13% and neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 7%. RELATED: Huckabee ends Fox News show to mull 2016 . Huckabee, who served as the Arkansas governor for nearly 11 years, benefits by having strong name recognition, thanks in part to his 2008 campaign but largely because of his successful cable news show that's kept him a mainstay in the conservative political dialogue for more than six years. Popular among social conservatives, the former Baptist pastor's prospects will likely have the biggest impact on Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Both men are seriously considering 2016 campaigns and have strong appeal among socially conservative voters. Santorum ultimately won the Iowa caucuses in 2012 in a delayed vote count, though Mitt Romney carried the early momentum since he was initially declared the winner. Huckabee's announcements could speed up the timelines for Cruz and Santorum, given that they'll be competing in the same donor pool â€” a race, in many respects, that has already begun. It could also bring renewed attention in the race to social issues. But Huckabee could be considered a threat to the candidacies of 2016 hopefuls outside the social conservative wing of the party. Rand Paul's political team was quick to pounce on Huckabee's announcement, buying ad space Saturday on Google and Twitter so that links to Paul's website came up when people searched for Huckabee's name. They employed similar tactics when Bush announced his interest. And while having high name identification and an Iowa win already under his belt can certainly be a boost, it doesn't guarantee another round of success in the Hawkeye State. George H.W. Bush, for example, won the Iowa caucuses in 1980, but lost the contest in 1988. Still, Bush went on to win the GOP nomination.

"President Barack Obama has signed into law a bill to avert the fiscal cliff, a day after the House and Senate approved the much-debated legislation. Obama, who returned to his family vacation in Hawaii after Tuesday's House vote, signed the bill via autopen on Wednesday. But new battles over taxes and spending await Washington in the next few weeks. Congress averted that self-built precipice late Tuesday when the House voted to stave off widespread tax increases and deep spending cuts by accepting a brokered Senate compromise. It makes permanent the Bush administration's tax cuts for individuals earning less than $400,000 per year and couples earning less than $450,000. It raises rates on those who make more than that from 35% to 39.6%, bringing back a top tax bracket from the Clinton administration, and will raise roughly $600 billion in new revenues over 10 years, according to various estimates. The bill also extends unemployment insurance and delays for two months the threat of sequestration -- a series of automatic, across-the-board cuts in federal spending. Economists had predicted the combination of those tax increases and spending cuts could have thrown the U.S. economy back into recession and driven unemployment back into the 9% range. Meanwhile, a new Congress takes office on Thursday, and lawmakers will soon be confronted by the need to raise the federal debt ceiling and what to do about the still-hanging sequester -- a legacy of the last battle over the debt ceiling, in 2011. Read more: Five things about the fiscal cliff . ""The sum total of all the budget agreements we've reached so far proves that there is a path forward that is possible, if we focus not on our politics but on what's right for the country,"" Obama told reporters late Tuesday, after the House approved the fiscal cliff deal. ""And the one thing that I think, hopefully, in the new year, we'll focus on is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinksmanship, not scare the heck out of folks quite as much."" The Bush tax cuts expired at midnight Monday, while sequestration had been scheduled to start when federal offices reopened Wednesday. World markets rose after the late-night vote. U.S. stocks jumped, too, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising nearly 2% by mid-afternoon. Rum, electric vehicles and motor sports: Nuggets in bill . Tuesday night's 257-167 vote saw Boehner, R-Ohio, and about a third of the GOP majority lining up with Democrats against most of their own caucus, including Majority Leader Eric Cantor and party whip Kevin McCarthy. Rep. Nan Hayworth, an outgoing Republican representative from New York, said she was a ""reluctant yes."" ""This is the best we can do, given the Senate and the White House sentiment at this point in time, and it is at least a partial victory for the American people,"" Hayworth said. ""I'll take that at this point."" The Senate plan was brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and it passed that Democratic-led chamber 89-8. But many House Republicans complained the bill did too little to cut spending while raising taxes for them to support it. Boehner's White House F-bomb . Conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist, whose Americans for Tax Reform pushes candidates to sign a pledge never to raise taxes, said the plan preserves most of the Bush tax cuts and won't violate his group's beliefs. ""The Bush tax cuts lapsed at midnight last night,"" Norquist tweeted Tuesday. ""Every (Republican) voting for Senate bill is cutting taxes and keeping his/her pledge."" But Rep. Jeff Landry, R-Louisiana, told CNN's ""Early Start"" that Obama convinced Boehner ""to undo everything he promised he would do"" after the 2010 elections that gave the GOP control of the House. ""They did a debt ceiling deal, gave the president $2.1 trillion,"" Landry said. ""They turned that deal off for two months. That's going to be another fight on top of the sequestration, a debt ceiling fight."" iReport: What's your message for Washington? Other Republicans warned that as they did in 2011, they'll be demanding additional cuts before they agree to raise the federal cap on borrowing. ""The president has maxed out his credit card, and he is not going to get an unlimited credit card,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, told CNN. ""We're going to talk specifically about cuts and specifically focused on tax reform as well as helping to save and strengthen Medicare and Social Security.  And that's the next discussion we're going to have in Washington."" The federal government bumped up against its $16.4 trillion debt ceiling on Monday and has about two months before it runs out of ways to shuffle money around to keep Washington within its legal borrowing limit. Obama had sought to resolve the issue as part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, but the issue never made it to a final bill. Tuesday night, the president warned Congress that he will not tolerate another round of brinksmanship that could have ""catastrophic"" effects on the global economy. ""While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they've passed,"" he said. How they voted: House | Senate . The last debt-ceiling battle led to the sequester, a kind of fiscal doomsday device that Congress was supposed to disarm by agreeing to more than $1 trillion in other cuts over the next decade. They didn't, leaving federal agencies preparing to slash spending by $110 billion by the end of the 2013 budget year. Before Tuesday night, the Defense Department had been preparing to issue furlough notices for its entire civilian work force of 800,000. Those notices were stayed on Wednesday -- but Pentagon officials say they're worried that unpaid leave may be harder to implement later in the fiscal year. ""We hope Congress can find a way to end sequester once and for all,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said. While the deal gives Obama bragging rights for raising income taxes on the wealthiest Americans -- the first rate increase for any Americans since 1993 -- it also leaves him breaking a promise. Obama had vowed to raise tax rates for the top-earning 2% of Americans, including those with household income above $250,000 and individuals earning more than $200,000. Raising the threshold for higher tax rates shrinks the number of Americans affected. While nearly 2% of filers have adjusted gross incomes over $250,000, only 0.6% have incomes above $500,000, according to the Tax Policy Center. By comparison, Census Bureau figures put the median U.S. household income at just over $50,000. And despite the last-minute fiscal cliff agreements, Americans are still likely to see their paychecks shrink somewhat because of a separate battle over payroll taxes. The government temporarily lowered the payroll tax rate in 2011 from 6.2% to 4.2% to put more money in the pockets of Americans. That adjustment, which has cost about $120 billion each year, expired Monday. Now, Americans earning $30,000 a year will take home $50 less per month. Those earning $113,700 will lose $189.50 a month. Opinion: Cliff deal hollow victory for American people . The legislation also caps itemized deductions for individuals making $250,000 and for married couples making $300,000. Taxes on inherited estates over $5 million will go up to 40% from 35%, and that threshold will be indexed for inflation. The alternative minimum tax, a perennial issue, will be permanently adjusted for inflation. Child care, tuition and research and development tax credits will be renewed. The ""Doc Fix"" -- reimbursements for doctors who take Medicare patients -- will continue, but it won't be paid for out of the Obama administration's signature health care law.","Boehner undid ""everything he promised he would do"" in 2010, GOP lawmaker says .

"Through the hotel lobby he goes, to the elevator, up into guest rooms, and back. Jaber lashkari says he hauls around 50 pieces of luggage along this well-worn route every day. But the porter at Tehran's Parsian Azadi Hotel says in the past several months his work has nearly doubled. ""Recently we've seen a big increase,"" he said. ""We don't need exercise or treadmills anymore. We walk more than anyone else."" Jaber's heavy workload comes amid a 215% increase this year in visits to Iran by tourists, according to a government official who called the surge a ""tsunami of tourists"". Hotel marketing and sales manager Zahra Manafzadeh says if this surge keeps up Tehran may soon run out of hotel space. ""It shows that we have to take action and do something about it,"" he said. Tehran may be a capital of some 12 million people, but remarkably it has only three large five-star hotels. A fourth is under construction yet most of Tehran's accommodations remain smaller apartment style hotels. Farman Ghafarian owns two of these enterprises -- Tehran Grand Hotels One and Two. The recent spike in visitors has him thinking expansion. ""We already have a shortage in Tehran,"" he said. ""Now it's motivating us to build a third branch because for sure we are anticipating much demand in the tourism market."" For much of the last three decades here in Tehran there was never an overwhelming demand for hotels. Many visitors stopped coming after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. This was in large part due to Iran's political and economic isolation by western powers and their warnings that Iran was rogue and dangerous nation with a radical leadership. Many in Iran's hotel and tourism industry credit the turnaround to first year president Hassan Rouhani who's been on a campaign to give a gentler and more positive impression of Iran by easing some visa requirements and working to resolve Iran's nuclear dispute with the West. ""After Mr. Rouhani became president I think everyone around the world thought Iran has changed,"" Manafzadeh said. ""They want to come and see what the difference is."" Many of those working in Iran's hotel industry feel the upswing in business is well deserved. For hotel porter Jaber it means hauling more luggage and helping tourists get to know the rich culture and hospitality of Iran. ""It feels good when they leave and they're happy -- especially when they rave about Iran,"" he said.","Iran has experienced a massive increase in tourists coming to country .
Capital Tehran currently only has three large five-star hotels .

"Republicans in Congress have begun their most forceful push yet in urging President Barack Obama to begin a military campaign into Syria to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""One of the key decisions the President is going to have to make is air power in Syria. We cannot give (ISIS) a base of operations,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on ""Fox News Sunday."" For nearly three years, Obama has refused to engage in a complicated civil war in Syria where different factions are fighting each other and attempting to topple President Bashar al-Assad. The President has actively defended his decision to not get involved in the war-torn country. But now that ISIS, which gained prominence and power in Syria, is expanding its scope, the domestic calls for the President to act in Syria are loud. Conservatives pushing for military action dominated the Sunday political talk shows less than one week after an ISIS militant with a British accent beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video of his killing. ""I don't want to hear from the President about how he's reacting to events,"" U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" ""I want to hear a strategy how he's going to fend ISIS off."" Is Obama heading toward airstrikes in Syria? Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that it is to ""America's peril"" if ISIS is not stopped. ""It's about time now to assume the worst about these guys, rather than to be underestimating them,"" he said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel gave a stark assessment of ISIS on Thursday, indicating the terror group, which has expanded its grip to western Iraq, needs to be addressed. ""This is beyond anything that we've seen. So we must prepare for everything. And the only way you do that is you take a cold, steely, hard look at it and get ready,"" Hagel said. At the same news conference, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. is going to expand its reach to address ISIS. He refused, however, to confirm that the U.S. would conduct airstrikes in Syria. ""It requires a variety of instruments, only one small part of which is airstrikes. I'm not predicting those will occur in Syria, at least not by the United States of America. But it requires the application of all of the tools of national power -- diplomatic, economic, information, military,"" he told reporters Thursday. Graham said the United States must do everything it can to defeat ISIS, even if that means U.S. ground troops become engaged. ""If our military commanders tell us that we need ground forces to defeat ISIL, which is a threat to the United States, so be it,"" he said. But Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the only Democrat to appear on the Sunday shows to talk about ISIS, pushed back against the idea that U.S. troops should enter into another ground war. ""The most effective use of our force is not putting troops on the ground, but using capable troops like Kurds with (U.S.) airstrikes,"" Reed said. Threat to the United States . The Republican lawmakers said their calls for expanded military action are justified because ISIS poses an ""imminent threat"" to the United States. ""We should, in my view, look at ISIL as a direct threat to the United States,"" Graham said, using the alternate name for ISIS. Graham's assessment mirrors all of the other top Republicans who appeared on political talk shows Sunday, who insisted that ISIS is capable of committing an attack on U.S. soil. ""I do think they present the greatest threat we've seen since 9/11,"" Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said on ABC's ""This Week."" ISIS siege cuts off small Iraqi town from food, water . Top military officials issued dire warnings about the severity of ISIS and their mission but stopped short of saying ISIS posed an immediate, direct threat to the United States. Dempsey described their mission as ""apocalyptic,"" and Hagel called the threat ""imminent ... to every interest we have."" McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he believes an attack on the U.S. is in the works. ""They would love more than nothing else to hit the United States of America,"" he added. Rep. Mike Rogers, Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the estimated 100 ISIS fighters who are American citizens and ""thousands"" that hold European passports make it easy for the trained militants to enter into the United States. ""They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores,"" Rogers said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Reed, a top Democratic member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, however, softened the immediacy of the threat. ""But to jump from what they have done, which is horrific, particularly the murder of Mr. Foley, to the assumption that they're going to be an immediate and within days a threat to us here in our homeland, I think you don't jump to that assumption, but you don't dismiss it,"" he said on ""State of the Union."" But Graham fired back: ""Here is the question. Can America be safe if ISIL is not defeated? I don't think we can."" Criticism of Obama . Republicans blamed the President for the expansion of ISIS, saying the terror groups' dominance stems from a lack of inaction in Syria when that country's civil war broke out nearly three years ago. ""I am heartbroken ... about what has happened to the Syrian people and a lot of that is due to our total inaction. And it's going to be one of the more shameful chapters in American history,"" McCain said. American held in Syria is released . Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire said the President's limited foreign policy is no longer acceptable. ""The containment aspect of it is not going to defeat them,"" Ayotte said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" McCaul echoed that same sentiment: ""I don't think you're going to win this with a containment policy alone. This administration thus far has only dealt with containment."" ""This is an opportunity for the President to take a step back, change his presidential guidance,"" Rogers said. Congress' role . Members of Congress have not yet expressed concern that the Obama administration has acted unilaterally by launching nearly 100 airstrikes in northern Iraq. More concerning to Republicans are cuts to the defense budget that cost more than half a trillion dollars, or 10% of its budget, over 10 years as part of an effort to reduce overall government spending. McCain said his ""his first goal"" when Congress returns to Washington in September is to repeal reduction to the defense budget. Ayotte agreed. ""There's a disconnect with sequester from the threats that we face around the world and the resources we are going to need to fight this threat,"" she said.","Republicans urge Obama to begin a military campaign into Syria to defeat ISIS .

"(CNN) -- Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has called plans to build a community center and mosque near the site of the 9/11 terror attack in New York City an ""unnecessary provocation."" ""Peace-seeking Muslims, pls understand, Ground Zero mosque is UNNECESSARY provocation; it stabs hearts,"" Palin wrote in a Twitter post Sunday. ""Pls reject it in interest of healing."" The former Republican vice presidential nominee also posted a plea asking ""peaceful New Yorkers"" to ""pls refute the Ground Zero mosque plan if you believe catastrophic pain caused @ Twin Towers site is too raw, too real."" Plans to build a $100 million, 13-story center have sparked an emotional debate. The developer, Sharif El-Gamal, describes the project as an ""Islamic community center"" that will include a 500-seat performing arts center, a lecture hall, an exhibition space, a swimming pool, a gym, a culinary school, a restaurant and a prayer space for Muslims. He said the project ""is not a mosque."" Plans for the project have called for a prayer space where an imam would lead services. A ""mosque"" is generally considered a space where Muslims worship. New York's Landmarks Preservation Commission is scheduled to vote in August on whether an 1850s structure on the site of the proposed center should be granted landmark status. Even if the commission approves landmark status, though, that may not necessarily halt construction of the center. Voices opposing the center dominated a hearing on the subject last week. ""It would be a terrible mistake to destroy a 154-year-old building in order to build a monument to terrorism,"" one woman said. The heckling and intense nature of the hearing got to be too much for some participants. ""I'm ashamed to be an American today,"" said Rakif Gathwari, a Muslim-American who reminded the crowd that people from many countries and religions died in the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. ""I want to prove to this hall that I am a citizen,"" Gathwari said, holding up his passport.

"While tensions remain high between the United States and North Korea, the relationship is more cordial between their scientists. Scientists from both nations are collaborating via nongovernmental organizations and universities on projects ranging from tuberculosis research and deforestation issues to digital information technology. The idea behind science diplomacy is to build bridges and relationships through research and academics despite political tensions. This month, a delegation of North Korean economic experts visited Silicon Valley to see various American businesses and academic institutions such as Stanford University. It may seem like a bizarre concept that two countries, at odds with each other, would share scientific knowledge. But science diplomacy existed between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War, as researchers cooperated on nuclear issues, space missions and technology.  And this practice continues, with U.S. scientists working with academics and researchers from adversarial states like Iran, Cuba and North Korea. ""A group of us who believe in science diplomacy, believe that it is useful to find people in those countries with whom you can find something in common, with whom you can discuss and can perhaps cooperate in areas not strategic, military or defense-related,"" said Dr. Norman Neureiter, senior adviser to the Center for Science, Technology and Security Policy, which is part of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, an international non-profit organization dedicated to advancing science. U.S. scientists, backed by a scientific engagement consortium that includes AAAS, Korea Society, U.S. Civilian Research & Development Foundation, Syracuse University and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, have worked with North Korean scientists and technical universities since 2007 to deliver lectures and share resources and knowledge about subjects such as reforestation, river reclamation, soil quality and agriculture. The U.S. government does not sponsor these activities. The visits are heavily supervised by North Korean minders.  Also, scientists cannot collaborate in areas related to weapons or the military. After a failed rocket launch last week, attention shifted to North Korea's scientific capabilities. The launch drew nearly universal criticism, with United Nations officials calling the country's decision to launch ""deplorable.""  The failed launch also triggered concerns about a possible nuclear test. ""The foreign powers are not the only ones with monopoly on military supremacy, and the days of their threatening and lying to us with atomic weapons is forever gone,"" said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in the centennial celebration of his grandfather's birth. Under these circumstances, sharing scientific and technological knowledge with North Korea may seem questionable. ""Given what has happened, those are legitimate concerns and questions,"" said Hyunjin Seo, assistant professor at the School of Journalism and Mass Communications at the University of Kansas, whose main area of focus is public diplomacy. ""The level of exchanges between the United States and North Korea is quite limited when it comes to science engagement,"" she added.  ""Given what scientists can bring to North Korea, there are a lot of limitations. So I don't think that those exchanges can really be blamed for helping North Korea."" Despite the rocket controversy, Seo supports continued efforts in science diplomacy.  She added that people should distinguish between North Koreans and its government. The intent behind scientific overtures is well-meaning, said Hank Song, a Washington-based human rights activist for North Koreans. ""Looking at it from bigger picture, one-on-one contact is good, because it exposes North Koreans to individuals and provides an opportunity to meet and talk with Americans,"" he said. ""But this is all done between the watchful eyes of the minders. When these meetings take place, the end result is, everything goes to help the regime. It doesn't help the people that really need help."" American and European scientists, including a Nobel laureate, an astronaut and other elite scientists, have visited North Korea in recent years and discussed ecology, biology, global weather systems and the Western scientific method, such as the peer review process. ""To simply oppose and coerce the North Koreans without trying to engage them is a prescription for failure,"" wrote David Hillmers, the only U.S. astronaut to visit North Korea, in an opinion piece for the Houston Chronicle after his visit. ""We can engage without appeasing."" Hillmers visited the elite Pyongyang University of Science and Technology in the nation's capital. The lessons are taught in English, and the school educates students in the modern sciences. Select groups of North Koreans have visited the United States. One group visited Google's headquarters in April, according to the Korean media site Chosun Ilbo. Google did not respond to inquiries about the meeting. The same group of 12 North Korean officials also visited Stanford University on April 1, where they learned about the history of Silicon Valley and discussed economic collaboration.  Researchers from Stanford and North Korea's Ministry of Public Health teamed up in 2008 to develop a way to detect drug-resistant tuberculosis. North Korea is believed to have one of the highest incidences of tuberculosis outside sub-Saharan Africa. This kind of project has mutual benefits. ""Re-emerging infectious diseases don't respect boundaries,"" said Vaughan Turekian, the chief international officer and director of the Center for Science Diplomacy at AAAS. He referred to cooperation with Burmese and American scientists in 2010. Before the political relationship between Myanmar (also known as Burma) and the United States began to thaw, scientists from both countries were addressing ways to tackle malaria and other infectious diseases. For 10 years, Syracuse University has worked with Kim Chaek University of Technology in North Korea to develop a digital information library so they would no longer have to rely on card catalogs. The data would be stored online. The program brings North Korean computer scientists to the New York campus, as the only academic exchange program between American and North Korean universities. ""During these difficult times, it's more important to have channels of communication that are not necessarily hostile,"" said Stuart Thorson, who directs Syracuse's integrated information technology research collaboration with Kim Chaek University. ""Countries are adversarial to the U.S., but open to science,"" he said. ""They like our science, our technology. This opens doors to places where our elected officials are not welcome."" Song, the human rights activist who works with North Korean defectors, remains doubtful that this has much impact on ordinary citizens. ""When I talk to defectors, they don't believe that these scientific exchanges will help the people. This will only help the regime."" In March, the American Association for the Advancement of Science launched a new quarterly journal called Science & Diplomacy, which examines the relationship between science and diplomacy.  An editorial published in its first issue recalled instances when the U.S. collaborated with its historic rivals such as Japan, China and the Soviet Union. ""American scientists and Russian scientists who had built nuclear weapons, built enough to destroy civilization,"" Neureiter said.  ""It would've completely destroyed both countries. But they began talking with each other, and gradually, they built an atmosphere of trust that influenced government policies.  It didn't suddenly topple the walls, but there was a basis of communication.""","No diplomatic relationship exists between the U.S. and North Korea, but scientists interact .

"A third video emerged Wednesday of MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, insulting voters and suggesting their ignorance was exploited by those pushing passage of the health care law. Neither the White House nor Gruber would comment. In this one, Gruber was discussing how then-Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, pushed forward a way to add a tax on expensive health insurance plans, or ""Cadillac Plans,"" that would purportedly tax the insurance companies though Gruber suggests everyone knew the companies would just pass on the additional cost to customers. ""It's a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" Gruber said at the Honors Colloquium 2012 at the University of Rhode Island. The moment is at about 29:25 in this video. The video was first reported by The Daily Caller. Over the weekend, media first became aware of a video of Gruber making a similar remark -- that the unintelligent voters were hoodwinked by those pushing passage of Obamacare, which was in his view for the good. That video, from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013 (which you can see here) featured Gruber saying, ""If you had a law which said healthy people are going to pay in -- if you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed, OK? Just like how people -- transparent -- lack of transparency is a huge advantage. And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass."" Gruber said he wished ""we could make it all transparent. But I'd rather have this law than not."" Asked for reaction to the video, Senator-elect Thom Tillis, R-NC, told The Lead that it sounded like Gruber was arguing that ""the ends justify the means...That is exactly what the American people are tired of. They want transparency. They want to be treated with respect. We did a lot of very difficult bills since I've been speaker of the house (of the North Carolina legislature). Some of them were controversial on both sides of the ideological spectrum. But we took the time to explain it to people and not do this sort of bob and weave."" On Tuesday, Gruber went on MSNBC to offer a mea culpa. ""I was speaking off the cuff and I spoke inappropriately, and I regret making those comments,"" he said. But then more videos emerged. Last night, Megyn Kelley on Fox News showed another excerpt of a Gruber lecture, this from Washington University at St. Louis in 2013, where he said ""they proposed it and that passed, because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference."" The videos were documented over the course of the last year by Rich Weinstein, an investment adviser who became interested in the origins of the law after the price of insurance for his family doubled. Weinstein tells CNN he has many more videos in his collection.","Economist Jonathan Gruber is considered one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act .

"(CNN) -- Pedro Passos Coelho, a businessman and opposition leader, is set to succeed Jose Socrates as Portugal's prime minister after his party scored a convincing victory in Sunday's election. According to official results posted online that accounted for more than 99% of all ballots, Coelho's Social Democratic Party had just under 39% of the vote. Socrates' Socialist Party was running a distant second at 28%, while the Popular Party had nearly 12% of the overall vote. In his victory speech, Coelho announced the Social Democrats, which won 105 parliamentary seats, would form a coalition government with the Popular Party, which won 24 seats. He also promised to tackle Portugal's burgeoning financial crisis, including taking steps to meet European Union requirements for deficit reduction and revenue hikes in order to receive bailout funds. ""This is a night for Portugal to celebrate this change,"" he said. ""We have our work cut out, but we aren't afraid of working."" Nearly 59% of Portugal's registered voters hit the ballot box Sunday, compared to a 61.5% turnout in 2002. In a speech Sunday night, Socrates -- who was first elected in 2002, and re-elected in 2009 -- acknowledged the loss and resigned as head of his party. ""We have lived through extraordinary national and international circumstances but the facts are the facts: We lost,"" said Socrates, who wished Coelho and Portugal well going forward. The early election was triggered by Socrates' resignation in March after the country's parliament rejected his austerity plan intended to ease the financial crisis. He remained on as the caretaker prime minister and hoped to muster more support in Sunday's election. During the campaign, Socrates criticized ""the obstruction"" to his austerity plan as ""intolerable."" But Coelho, in a March 30 guest column in the Wall Street Journal, headlined ""Our Plan to Fix Portugal,"" criticized Socrates' plan for failing to spur growth while ""imposing unacceptable sacrifices on the most vulnerable members of society."" ""We voted against the ... austerity measures not because they went too far, but because they didn't go far enough,"" wrote the 46-year-old Coelho. ""It was too much tax and not enough cost reduction."" He said his party plans to reduce Lisbon's public deficit to 4.6% of gross domestic product in 2011 (a figure that was 7% last year) and, by 2013, down further to 2% of GDP. He added that he supported reforms aimed at making Portuguese businesses more competitive internationally. His plan, he said, would do so by reducing costs, increasing productivity and pushing viable industries by instituting ""predictable tax policies, effective conflict resolution and reducing bureaucracy."" ""We now have new hope for getting new growth in our economy, to show everyone that we are absolutely committed to reach the (EU mandates),"" Coelho said Sunday night. ""I hope this is a new step for Portugal to re-establish confidence."" Coelho, who was born in Coimbra and spent five years of his childhood in the then-Portuguese colony of Angola, will bring a business background when, as expected, he assumes the prime minister's job from Socrates in the coming weeks. Active in Portuguese politics since 1980, most of those in Parliament and since 2010 as his party's leader, he has also made a name for himself in business. Since 2007, he has been executive director of Forment Invest, a firm focused on investing in environmentally friendly projects. Like Greece and Ireland, the Portuguese government has already asked for outside help to address its budget crisis, one that's gotten worse in the worldwide economic downturn. That request to the European Commission was made in April. The cost of Portugal's borrowings has gone up drastically since Socrates resigned in March. Portugal was due to repay more than 4 billion euros ($5.68 billion) to investors in April, followed by payments of almost 5 billion in mid-June.

"Five things kill more people in the United States than anything else: heart disease, cancer, lung disease such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, stroke and unintentional injuries such as those on roads or caused by medication overdoses. Together, these five conditions cause almost two-thirds of all deaths in the country -- nearly 900,000 each year. On Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is releasing its first report on potentially preventable deaths from those causes in each one of the 50 states. The data suggest we could prevent at least a third of those deaths. We already know how to do it -- now we need to act on what we know. Whether it's by investing resources, using proven strategies or coordinating with health care systems, we have within our communities the strengths to help people live long and healthy lives. Even identifying and focusing on just one issue that can be addressed in each community will make a difference. The greatest impact comes when we make the default choice the healthy choice -- for example, making heart-healthy actions part of the normal course of everyday life. CDC: 200,000 people die needlessly every year . We can make it easier for people to be physically active, avoid tobacco and have access to affordable, healthy food. We can make it easier for people to get recommended clinical preventive services such as blood pressure management and cancer screening, and to have access to good quality health care when it's needed. And we can make it so that our children are likely to reach adulthood without being addicted to nicotine or facing a potentially lifelong struggle with obesity. Here are some examples of communities making a difference: . • In San Francisco, 44,000 children have access to safe recreational space because public school playgrounds are now open during nonschool hours. • Nearly 700,000 residents of Broward County, Florida, can increase their level of physical activity because their community is improving the safety and accessibility of walking, riding bikes and using public transportation. These are just two examples of success stories, large and small, that make the healthy choice easy. The Million Hearts initiative, launched by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2011, brings together communities, health systems, nonprofit organizations, federal agencies and private-sector partners to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Americans suffer 2 million heart attacks and strokes each year, which cause one in every three deaths and add more than $300 billion to our annual health care bill. Million Hearts will reduce these human and economic costs by improving care for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, helping patients quit smoking and increasing use of aspirin for those who will benefit from it. Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of death in this country and in the world. Tobacco use is a major factor in four out of the five leading causes of death: heart disease, cancer, lung disease and stroke. It causes about a third of heart disease and cancer, and most emphysema. Getting the last 20% of Americans who still smoke to quit will make a huge difference in the length and quality of their lives. Most people in this country who smoke started as kids, most who have ever smoked have already quit, and most current smokers want to quit. We know it can kill us: Why people still smoke . We can prevent children from starting to smoke, help motivate smokers to quit and protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke by working at federal, state and local levels to eliminate loopholes in restrictions on tobacco marketing, pricing and products, and by expanding smoke-free regulations that cover all public places and workplaces without exception. This kind of change requires political will, especially when faced with vocal and well-organized opponents funded by the tobacco industry. We've learned from health systems around the country that big improvements can come from simple measures that focus clinical attention. These include effective use of electronic health records to identify and track the progress of patients who need support, team-based care and the use of protocols and prompt data feedback. Change is never easy. But each year we don't act adds tens of thousands of preventable deaths to the toll. We owe it to the American people to do better.","Heart disease, cancer and lung disease are among the top five U.S. killers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps has taken command of Iranian naval operations in the Persian Gulf, the U.S. military has revealed. An Iranian sailor monitors a Revolutionary Guards missile test in the Persian Gulf in 2006. That means U.S. naval forces are operating in the same waters as an organization the United States considers a major supporter of terrorist activity. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made the disclosure Wednesday at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he was answering questions from military students. Afterward, in a written statement, the U.S. Navy Fifth Fleet in Bahrain said, ""Based on activities observed in the Arabian Gulf over the past several months, it appears the Iranian navy has shifted its patrol areas to the Strait of Hormuz and Gulf of Oman -- leaving the IRGC navy to provide the primary Iranian naval presence in the Arabian Gulf."" The move is of concern to the U.S. Navy, which has long viewed the IRGC's forces as more antagonistic than Iran's regular navy. Mullen said Iran made a ""strategic decision"" in recent months to ""essentially give the entire Gulf to the IRGC over the next four or five years."" ""That's a big deal, because I think part of the leading-edge challenge with Iran is the IRGC specifically,"" Mullen said. For the past several months, IRGC forces have occupied a sunken barge and crane near Iraqi oil terminals at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. The IRGC is using the site as an observation post for the area, which is patrolled regularly by U.S. and coalition naval forces. Mullen's comments reflect the chairman's concern about not just Iran's nuclear program, but also its arms shipments to Iraq and Afghanistan and statements against Israel, a senior U.S. Navy official said. The United States has long said it believes the IRGC is behind those arms shipments, but it has stopped short of saying the central government of Iran is responsible for those actions. IRGC forces earlier this year seized a group of British sailors at the northern end of the Gulf and held them for several days. The British had been conducting a boarding of a merchant vessel, as part of an approved coalition operation in the Gulf. Since that incident, security measures for boarding parties have been stepped up, a senior U.S. Navy official said. New procedures during all boardings include flying an armed helicopter overhead and having an armed vessel close by. A U.S. Navy official in the region said that operations in proximity to Iran's regular navy have been ""formal and correct,"" but added that IRGC forces ""rarely respond"" to U.S. Navy attempts at ship-to-ship communications with them. Several U.S. Navy officials said the move is militarily significant for the United States because of the IRGC's terrorist affiliation. U.S. Navy ships would not want IRGC vessels sailing too close to them because of that concern, they said. One official said Iran's regular naval forces evoke less concern because they ""represent a nation state."" The IRGC was formed in 1979. Under Iran's constitution, the corps' task is to protect the revolution, which generally means that it makes sure that domestic forces don't threaten the theocratic state, said analyst William Samii of the Center for Naval Analyses. The center is a government-funded think tank for the Department of the Navy in Alexandria, Virginia. In contrast, the conventional forces are tasked with protecting the country's borders and guaranteeing its security. The naval move ""makes perfect sense,"" Samii said in a telephone interview. In recent years, the Iranian military has recognized that, in a toe-to-toe fight with the U.S. military, ""they'd get squashed,"" Samii said. In response, it has been focusing more on alternative tactics, in which the Revolutionary Guards excel, such as setting mine fields and using large numbers of small boats either packed with explosives or manned by personnel carrying rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The thinking is that at least one would be able to get close enough to a large enemy military vessel to attack it, Samii said. ""Iran is trying to send a signal that it is ready for any military eventuality and that it is prepared to defend itself aggressively,"" he said. But the move could backfire by driving Iran's Gulf neighbors into the arms of the United States, which has guaranteed the security of Arab states in the Gulf for decades, Samii said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former transit police officer convicted last year in the shooting death of an unarmed man on an Oakland, California, train platform will be freed from prison early Monday morning, according to a court order. Johannes Mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, but California law gives him one day of good conduct credit for each of the 365 days he's already served behind bars, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Perry said in an order signed Friday. Mehserle, a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer when the shooting occurred, said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun when he fatally wounded 22-year-old Oscar Grant on New Years Day 2009. Mehserle, who has been behind bars since a Los Angeles jury found him guilty on July 8, 2010, will be free to walk out of prison just after midnight Sunday, Perry said. Violent protests erupted in Oakland last November when Perry sentenced Mehserle to just two years in prison, which meant he would possibly be released after another seven months. At least 150 people were arrested during the protests, which Oakland Police Chief Anthony Batts described at the time as ""tearing up the city."" Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson, had asked the judge to sentence Mehserle to the maximum 14 years in prison. She and four other family members who spoke at the sentencing hearing last year called him ""a murderer."" The jury acquitted him of the more serious charges of second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. Although his defense attorney argued for probation, Mehserle told Perry before sentencing that he would be willing to go to prison if the sentence made his city and family safer. ""I shot a man,"" he said. ""I killed a man. It should not have happened."" A conviction for involuntary manslaughter normally carries a four-year sentence, but the judge had the option of adding an ""enhancement"" that could have made the sentence 14 years because a firearm was used in commission of a crime. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Johannes Mehserle can walk out of prison early Monday .

"Misogyny is so deeply rooted in India's collective psychology that even the president's son -- in this case, Congress Parliament member Abhijit Mukherjee -- could entangle himself with a remark against women protesting gang rape. He called them ""dented and painted women"" who go to discos, have little connection with ground realities and are making candlelight vigils fashionable. After an enormous backlash, he apologized and retracted his comments, but many are not satisfied and want his resignation . Misogyny has long permeated our textbooks, our pedagogy and our parenting. In fact, it runs so deep that it reflects itself even in our linguistics. The Hindi phrase most commonly used to describe sexual violence or rape against women is ""izzat lootna,"" which means ""to steal the honor of."" Another Hindi word used for rape, ""balatkar"" (or ""bad act""), is considered so erudite and technical that it's barely ever used. (Its English equivalent would be ""coitus"" instead of ""sex."") So, for the most part, we're stuck with ""izzat lootna"" -- and the necessary question: Why should a rapist be given so much credit? Rape is a criminal act of force and perverse subjugation. When a woman is raped, her most fundamental rights as a human being are violated. Yet, she is just as honorable as she ever was. Honor cannot be stolen. It can only be surrendered. Surely in the act of rape, it is the perpetrator, not the victim, who surrenders honor. The brave girl from Delhi died with her honor intact. Her rapists will live in ignominy. Unfortunately, in India rape is inextricably linked by men -- and women -- to shame: the ultimate desecration. Many victims are murdered by their rapists or choose to commit suicide. It is also not uncommon for the parents of rape victims to kill themselves. Thus, most victims don't speak up about what happened to them, lest their families be ostracized, lest they never find a husband or be shunned by their friends. About 10 months ago, I was offered a role of a young, urban woman who gets gang raped. The film explores how she chooses to deal with what happens to her. It is a very powerful script, and most of me wanted to accept the role immediately. But a gnawing part of me worried about how I'd be perceived by the general public were I to perform this role. Female sexuality in Hindi cinema is extremely fraught, especially because audiences seem unable to comprehend the distinction between what a role demands from an actor and that person's conduct offscreen. In the script the woman is attractive, confident and self aware; she'd had several consensual relationships with men and enjoyed her sexuality. Truth be told, her character is not far from me in real life. Still, in patriarchal, judgmental, misogynistic Indian society, these are labels most women are afraid to carry publicly. On top of this, the character gets raped. I was afraid to accept the role. Afraid of whether audiences and the media would think I was promiscuous, desecrated. Embarrassed at the prospect of saying I'm doing a film in which I get raped, lest aspersions be cast on my character. There lay, in my own mind, the seeds of the same misogyny that makes Mr. Mukherjee's remarks in the wake of the student's gang rape so deplorable. Seeds I had to uproot at once. I accepted the role. At the time I was offered the film, rape wasn't getting the sort of national attention it is getting right now. It was still a topic that made most people uncomfortable, a topic that women and men alike were not able to freely express their opinions on. That India's young public is today demanding so vocally the need to address the way we view sexuality and gender equality is empowering. People are sharing their own experiences of sexual violence on blogs and social media. Men and women are collaborating to seek legal reform, to challenge the societal perceptions they have been force-fed. We now understand that to remain silent bystanders of a crime is to collude with the criminal. It is clear to me that as actors, filmmakers, artists, journalists, activists -- people who use a medium that has the potential to reach so many minds -- it is our responsibility to educate and mobilize, while we entertain. For the last 10 months, as we have been rehearsing and shooting, the subject of rape has been my foremost preoccupation. Two points have struck me in particular: First, the director, who is also the scriptwriter, is male. His co-writer, the music composer, is also male. These two artists, Tarun Chopra and Daboo Malik, chose to champion a cause that almost always gets packaged as a women's issue. In India, sexual violence is perpetrated almost entirely by men. Rapists are male. Should men not feel responsible then to prevent the occurrence of this crime? Shouldn't men be disturbed that their mothers, sisters, wives and daughters constantly feel unsafe or feel they have to dress and behave in a particular way to avoid getting raped? Isn't it time men educated other men about consent? Secondly, and this point took me longer to acknowledge, women are as guilty as men for the mindset that breeds the crime. We kill our own infant daughters, we immolate our sons' wives if they bear female children, we disapprove of women who make an effort to be attractive -- and doubt their character. We still look at marriage as if it's the purpose for which we were born. But misogyny is no longer misogyny when expressed by a woman. It's self-loathing. And while it is easy -- and justified -- for women to point fingers at men for the chauvinism in our society, don't we owe it to ourselves to look within?

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Federal authorities said Tuesday that health care providers could consider simply watching for flu symptoms in some individuals rather than prescribing preventive antiviral drugs right away if a person has been exposed to the flu. CDC: The fact that the virus has mutated little in recent months is a reason for optimism. ""In the new guidance, we add an option,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Instead of preventive use of antivirals, providers might want to consider watchful waiting."" Under watchful waiting, a clinician would wait to see whether someone who came into contact with an infected person went on to develop flu symptoms -- like fever or respiratory problems -- before prescribing the drugs, she said. But the list of people with flu symptoms who should be given antivirals remains unchanged from the disease agency's recommendations in May, she said. It includes people with chronic conditions, the very young, the very old and pregnant women. ""Timing is important,"" she said. ""Beginning treatment within 48 hours of symptoms can really help with the outcomes. People can do better with the illness."" One way to speed access to the drugs would be for a doctor to write his or her high-risk patients prescriptions, which they would fill only after they had developed symptoms and discussed those symptoms with their doctors, Schuchat said.  How much do you know about H1N1? Take our quiz » . That would save patients the time needed to see their doctor and would ease the load of sick people descending on their physicians' offices, she said. But anyone with difficulty breathing, and particularly young children under age 5 who have bluish skin, difficulty eating, vomiting ""that just doesn't stop"" or a difficult time waking up should consult their physician, she said. Already, some Southeastern states -- particularly Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida -- have been hit hard by the swine flu virus, also known as 2009 H1N1 influenza, perhaps because schools opened earlier there, she said.  Watch Schuchat talk about the upcoming flu season » . On Friday, 24 elementary and secondary schools dismissed about 25,000 students because of the flu, Schuchat said. ""It's causing increased disease, and it's time to pay attention,"" she said. ""We wish we could predict exactly what is going to happen, but unfortunately we cannot."" Still, there are reasons for optimism, including the fact that the virus has changed little in recent months, suggesting that a vaccine under development will prove effective, she said. All patients hospitalized with flu should get the antivirals, she said, even before the strain they have is confirmed by a laboratory test. But most people will not need antiviral medications, she said. ""In fact, if all those people take antiviral medications, things may actually get worse,"" she cautioned, citing the risk that H1N1 might mutate to forms resistant to the antivirals. Except for hospitalized patients, others with flu-like symptoms are not being tested to confirm they have swine flu, since ""virtually all of the influenza that's circulating right now in the United States is the 2009 H1N1 strain,"" Schuchat said. Dr. Tom Jefferson, who reviewed the efficacy of the antivirals, said he was unimpressed. He noted that Tamiflu, the most commonly used antiviral, can have serious side effects that the CDC did not cite. Its benefits -- shortening the duration of illness by one to two days and reducing viral excretion from the nose -- are modest, he said. ""The evidence that they do anything else is controversial and there is a possibility of harms, which hasn't been taken seriously,"" said Jefferson, a medical epidemiologist with the Cochrane Collaboration, an international, independent network of volunteers who prepare systematic reviews of evidence. The CDC's own Web site cites nausea without vomiting by 10 percent and vomiting by 9 percent of adults taking Tamiflu. It also said ""transient neuropsychiatric events"" such as self-injury or delirium have been reported among people taking the drug and that the Food and Drug Administration ""advises that persons receiving oseltamivir [Tamiflu] be monitored closely for abnormal behavior."" Jefferson, in a telephone interview from his home in Rome, Italy, said the FDA database reported harms, ""from trivial all the way down to death,"" that have been linked to Tamiflu. Citing the development of drug resistance as ""a mathematical certainty,"" he urged the drugs be given sparingly. The CDC's Schuchat told reporters that, in order to prevent shortages and avoid resistance, health officials are not recommending prophylactic use of Tamiflu. She said most of the handful of people in whom resistance to the antiviral was found had taken it before they got sick.","Feds tweak recommendations for who should get antiviral therapy for H1N1 flu .

"Was it the ultimate adventure or an audacious act of disrespect that should be punished by law?

"A new law in Israel makes it a sex crime to post sexual pictures or videos to the internet without the consent of the person featured in them. We need to follow that example. Revenge porn can ruin a person's life. A single post can go viral. For example, in the United States, ""Jane"" allowed her ex-boyfriend to take her naked photograph because, he assured her, it would be for his eyes only. After their breakup, the man betrayed her trust. On the revenge porn site UGotPosted, he uploaded her naked photo and contact information. Jane received calls, e-mails, and Facebook friend requests from hundreds of strangers, many of whom wanted sex. After the site refused to take down the post and the anonymous calls and e-mails intensified, she turned to law enforcement. According to the officers, nothing could be done because her ex had not engaged in a harassing ""course of conduct,"" as required by criminal harassment law, and because he had not explicitly solicited others to stalk her. Criminal law should have a role in deterring and punishing revenge porn. It's not new that certain types of privacy invasions  are crimes. Many states prohibit the nonconsensual taking of sexually explicit images -- the disclosure of someone's  naked images should be criminalized as well. Only California and New Jersey have laws against turning people into objects of pornography without their permission  -- although a huge loophole in California allows the posting of ""selfie"" images and only applies to photos posted by the photographer. Revenge porn and its ilk raise the risk of offline stalking and physical attack. Fear can be profound. Victims don't feel safe leaving their homes. Jane, who is a nurse, did not go to work for days. As many victims have told me, they struggle especially with anxiety, and some suffer panic attacks. Revenge porn victims withdraw from online engagement, shutting down their social media profiles and blogs to prevent strangers from finding them online.  They cannot participate fully in our networked age. The professional costs of revenge porn are steep. Because searches of victims' names display their naked images, they lose their jobs. Schools have fired teachers whose naked photos appeared on revenge porn sites. A government agency terminated a woman's employment after a co-worker circulated her nude photograph to colleagues. Victims may be unable to find work at all. According to a 2009 Microsoft study, more than  80% of employers rely on candidates' online reputations as an employment screen. Common reasons for not interviewing and hiring applicants include concerns about their ""lifestyle,"" ""inappropriate"" online comments, and ""unsuitable"" photographs, videos, and information about them. Recruiters don't contact victims to see if they posted nude photos of themselves or if someone else did in violation of their trust. The simple but regrettable truth is that after consulting search results, employers don't call revenge porn victims to schedule an interview or to extend offers. It's just seen as good business to avoid hiring people whose search results would reflect poorly on them. Revenge porn is a harmful form of bigotry and sexual harassment. It exposes victims' sexuality in humiliating ways. Their naked photos appear on slut shaming sites. Once their naked images are exposed, anonymous strangers send e-mail messages that threaten rape. Some have said: ""First I will rape you, then I'll kill you."" Victims internalize these frightening and demeaning messages. New Jersey is the only state to make it a felony to disclose a person's nude or partially nude images without that person's consent. In California, it's a misdemeanor. The New Jersey statute is a helpful model for states that are considering proposals to criminalize revenge porn. Congress should amend the federal cyberstalking law, 18 U.S.C. § 2261A, to cover the use of any interactive computer service to produce or disclose a sexually graphic visual depiction of an individual without that individual's consent. What about First Amendment objections to legislative proposals to criminalize revenge porn? A narrowly crafted criminal statute like New Jersey's can be reconciled with our commitment to free speech. First Amendment protections are less rigorous for purely private matters because the threat of liability would not risk chilling the meaningful exchange of ideas. Listeners and speakers have no legitimate interest in nude photos or sex tapes published without the subjects' permission. That online users can claim a prurient interest in viewing sexual images does not transform them into a matter of legitimate public concern. Nonconsensual pornography lacks First Amendment value as a historical matter, and could be understood as categorically unprotected as obscenity. Although the Court's obscenity doctrine has developed along different lines with distinct justifications, nonconsensual pornography can be seen as part of obscenity's long tradition of proscription. Criminalizing revenge porn is a crucial step in protecting victims from real and profound harms to their physical, emotional, and financial health and safety. It would deter damaging privacy invasions and send the powerful message that posting someone's most private moments, most often in a breach of their trust and without their permission, is unacceptable. That lesson needs to be repeated early and often before online users, especially young people, think that shaming and terrorizing individuals is an acceptable practice. We need a ""cyber civil rights"" agenda to combat bigoted online abuse. The criminalization of nonconsensual disclosure of someone's naked images is an important part of that agenda.","Danielle Citron: ""Jane's"" ex posted nude photo on revenge porn site with contact info .

"The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation brought in $144.4 million in 2013, a three-fold growth from the $51.5 million the foundation received in 2012, according to tax documents released on Wednesday. Though the group said in a statement the boost came from a consolidation with other charities under the foundation, the jump could also be seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. ""In 2013 the Foundation reconsolidated the Clinton Global Initiative into its operations,"" Andrew Kessel, the foundation's chief financial officer, wrote in a letter attached to the tax forms. ""As such, the 990 tax document shows a corresponding increase in both revenue and expenses."" According to the filing, nine donors collectively gave over $60 million. One donor gave $15 million, while three more gave around $10 million. The foundation does disclose a range of their donors online -- though they are not legally obligated to -- but the names of these donors are blacked out on the tax filing. ""In 2013, the Foundation expanded our work, reinforced our financial footing, and became better positioned to maximize our impact for years to come,"" Kessel said. ""Our tax statements reflect these improvements."" While revenue went up, so did expenses. Nearly 10% -- or $8.1 million -- of the foundation's $84.6 million in expenses was spent on travel. The only categories with higher expenses were salaries and wages and ""conferences, conventions and meetings."" And now at least one conservative group, America Rising PAC, is calling on Clinton to detail the foundation's expenses to reveal whether the Clintons' politically-related travel during the 2014 midterms was funded by the nonprofit organization. ""We are calling on the Foundation to release details of how their travel and fundraising budget was spent so voters know the extent to which the Clinton's use the charity to subsidize their lavish travel, courtship of potential 2016 donors, and political schedule,"" the PAC's executive director Tim Miller said in an email. Early in 2013, just shortly after Hillary Clinton left her post as America's top diplomat, the foundation that was once simply known as the William J. Clinton Foundation was renamed to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton has been very visible at the foundation's events. She led a number of sessions at the group's annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York this year and just last week led a session at a foundation event in Little Rock. Since leaving the State Department, Clinton has stepped up her role in fundraising for the foundation, too. When Clinton served as secretary of state, the foundation pledged to disclose their donors and stopped holding events overseas in order to avoid conflict of interest claims between her role and the foundations. With Clinton eying another run at the presidency, a spokesman for the foundation said earlier this year that should Clinton run for president, the ""precedent"" of what the foundation did while she served as secretary of state would serve as a guide to how they would handle her run .","The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation had a three-fold growth in contributions from 2012 to 2013 .

It is just the latest accolade to be handed to Djokovic, who was also named Laureus Sportsman of the year last week after winning 41 matches in a row at the start of 2011 and losing only six all year. ""I may have dreamed of lifting the trophy at Wimbledon, but I could never have thought that my country would reward me with such great honor,"" the 24-year-old five-time grand slam winner told his official website. ""I am indebted to my people, and I will do my best to continue representing our beautiful country in the best possible way."" Tadic praised Djokovic, saying: ""Novak deserves the medal for special merits in representing Serbia."" Serbian Tennis Federation president Vuk Jeremic described Djokovic, who was part of Serbia's Davis Cup-winning team in 2010, as the greatest sporting hero the country has produced. ""Tennis has become the most popular sport in Serbia and a source of collective pride,"" Jeremic told CNN of Djokovic's impact. ""People identify with Novak, and draw great inspiration from his can-do, never-give-up attitude. He's the role model -- unbreakable, devoted, patriotic, charismatic."" As well as the impact Djokovic has had on the court, Jeremic also hailed the positive impact he has had on Serbia's image around the world. ""No athlete in our history has become such a national hero. And as far as Serbia's image abroad is concerned -- can you think of a better public diplomacy vehicle?"" Djokovic will next be in action at the Dubai Tennis Championships at the end of this month for an event he has won the last three years.","Novak Djokovic has been given Serbia's highest honor at a ceremony in Belgrade .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- At least 80 people are dead as a result of a rampage Friday on a Norwegian island, police said, an attack that came shortly after an explosion killed seven others in the Scandinavian nation's capital. Police have detained a 32-year-old Norwegian man who they suspect opened fire on scores at the ruling Labour Party's youth camp on Utoya Island, about 20 miles from Oslo. Police spokesman Are Frykholm, who told CNN early Saturday about the death toll spike, said authorities are investigating further, based on information from the man. That attack and the massive explosion in the heart of Oslo are definitely linked, police said. Seven were killed in the attack in the Norwegian capital, officials said. In all, 90 people were hospitalized as a result of the Oslo blast, said Erik Hansen, a spokesman for Oslo Mayor Fabian Stang. The mayor's staff members were searching for housing for people, many of them elderly, whose homes were damaged, Hansen said. Frykholm, the police spokesman, said that the man arrested on the island appeared to match the description of a person who was seen near the government buildings shortly before the bomb erupted. The man was wearing a police emblem on his blue sweater, though he does not work for police, Frykholm said. The prime minister, whose office was badly damaged in the Oslo blast, leads Norway's Labour Party, which runs the youth camp, where about 700 people were in attendance on Friday. People at the camp said the man arrived Friday on the boat that ferries visitors across the 3/4-mile of water from the mainland and told campers that he was carrying out a security check, Labour Party member Bjorn Jarle Roberg-Larsen told CNN. ""After just a few minutes, he took a handgun and started to shoot people,"" Roberg-Larsen said. ""A panic broke out; people tried to hide; some jumped into the water and tried to swim ashore."" Others took shelter in caves or bushes, or climbed trees. ""And he went after them,"" the party member said. ""Unfortunately, a lot of people are wounded and also a lot of people are dead."" The acting national police chief, Sveinung Sponheim, told reporters in Oslo that the gun was an automatic weapon and that undetonated explosives were found on the island after the attack. The vast majority of the Labour Party youth movement attendees were between the ages of 16 and 22, though some were as young as 13 and others as old as their early 30s, Roberg-Larsen said. They had been planning to attend political training classes and participate in group activities during the day and sleep in tents at night, he said. Citing Norwegian broadcasters, he said that the man was stopped by Norwegian police. Roberg-Larsen said the nearest hospital was asking donors to give type O blood, the most common type. ""It's a bad day for Norway,"" he said. ""We have never had any terrorist attack on Norwegian soil before. Today, we have had two, so people are completely shocked."" Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store, a Labour Party member, said he had visited the camp on Thursday. ""There was political discussion, there was joy, there was everything that is associated with a political youth camp."" He said that the fact that the suspect is a blond Norwegian man should underscore the importance of allowing police to do their work before drawing any conclusions. ""We've seen in Europe in recent years that politicians have been jumping to conclusions about suspects before investigations have been conducted, and we will not commit that error."" Friday's events will have an enduring influence on Norway, but will not fundamentally change the country or what it stands for, he predicted. ""Today, free government was attacked, freedom of association was attacked, the spirit of youth was attacked. But we will kick back and say that these are values that are dear to us, and we intend to defend them and Norway will be recognizable tomorrow as the Norway our friends and partners around the world have known so far."" Oslo Mayor Stang said it was a ""terrible day"" for Norwegians. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was not in his office at the time of the blast and was not hurt, officials said. Afterward, he had a message to whoever may have been responsible: ""You won't destroy us,"" he said. ""You won't destroy our democracy. We are a small but proud nation. No one can bomb us to silence. No one can scare us from being Norway. This evening and tonight, we'll take care of each other. That's what we do best when attacked."" Nick Soubiea, an American-Swedish tourist in Oslo, said he was fewer than 100 yards from the blast, which he described as deafening. ""It was almost in slow motion, like a big wave that almost knocked us off our chairs,"" he told CNN. ""It was extremely frightening."" Several buildings in Oslo were on fire, smoke billowing from them, he said. One explosion appeared to have occurred on an upper floor of a main government building; every window on the side of the building had been blown out. The blast also damaged the Oil Ministry, which caught fire. In brief remarks to reporters from the Oval Office, U.S. President Barack Obama extended his condolences to the victims of the violence in Norway, saying the incidents are ""a reminder that the entire international community has a stake in preventing this kind of terror from occurring."" Heide Bronke, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman, said Washington was monitoring the situation but did not have any word of U.S. casualties. British Foreign Secretary William Hague also condemned the attacks. ""We condemn all acts of terrorism,"" he said. ""The UK stands shoulder to shoulder with Norway and all our international allies in the face of such atrocities."" British Ambassador to Norway, Jane Owen, told CNN she was working in the embassy when she felt the blast three miles away. ""The whole building shook here in the embassy,"" she said. ""It was quite a sizeable explosion and a huge shock. ... The results demonstrate that it was a very large bomb."" She added, ""As we have all experienced, you can never be totally prepared for the horror and the tragedy that unfolds when you do have a major terrorist incident and that is, unfortunately, what the people of Oslo and Norway are now having to cope with."" Stoltenberg, who has been prime minister since October 2005, heads a coalition government comprising the Labour Party, the Socialist Left Party and the Centre Party.

"A British hostage whose life ISIS threatened in a video was helping to provide humanitarian relief in Syria when he was abducted last year, an aid agency said. David Haines is a logistics and security manager for ACTED, a Paris-based relief organization that was helping provide food, tents and water at a camp for tens of thousands of people displaced by Syria's civil war, the agency said Friday. Haines, 44, is a longtime aid worker who has helped victims of conflict since 1999, ACTED said. He was near the camp at Atmeh, Syria, close to the Turkey border, when he was abducted in March 2013, ACTED spokesman Adrien Tomarchio said. ISIS, an Islamist militant group that calls itself the Islamic State, posted a video online this week showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff -- the second beheading of a U.S. journalist by ISIS in two weeks. After the beheading, the video shows and threatens the life of a man that it identifies as Haines. ""ACTED is deeply shocked by the images broadcasted earlier this week. The threats on David Haines' life are intolerable,"" the aid group said in a statement. ""A man's life should never be threatened on account of his humanitarian commitment,"" the group added. ISIS blamed the Americans' killings on President Barack Obama's decision last month to conduct airstrikes in Iraq against the militant group. ISIS, one of the major belligerents in Syria's civil war pitting rebel groups against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has taken large swaths of northern and eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate. The group has brutally slaughtered both religious minorities and fellow Muslims as it tries to expand its rule, with witnesses and videos testifying of crucifixions and public executions. As logistics manager, Haines had been in charge of procuring humanitarian goods for people staying at the Atmeh camp, Tomarchio said. Haines' years of experience as an aid worker has made him a reassuring presence among his colleagues, Tomarchio said. Haines has helped victims of conflict in the Balkans, Africa and the Middle East, the spokesman said. The Atmeh camp still is operating, but Tomarchio wouldn't say whether ACTED remains involved there. The group does have relief activities in Syria that are managed from a distance, he said. The United Kingdom said this week it had attempted to rescue one of its citizens held by ISIS ""some time ago"" but failed. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works. ""You wouldn't expect me to discuss various options that we will be considering,"" he said. ""But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person.""","Man threatened in ISIS video was working for French aid group ACTED .

"(CNN) -- It's a safe bet that whoever wins the presidential election will face fateful decisions on foreign policy in 2013. In a series of forums sponsored by three Washington-based foundations and livestreamed by CNN Opinion this year, experts have explored the issues that are likely to face the next administration. On Wednesday, another session will feature a debate between representatives of the Obama and Romney campaigns -- Dov Zakheim, representing Mitt Romney, will debate Janine Davidson, an adviser to the Obama campaign. It will be streamed live on CNN Opinion at 9 p.m. ET. Here's a summary of several recent opinion pieces on foreign policy. Robert Kagan: America has made the world freer, safer, and wealthier . International order is not an evolution; it is an imposition. It is the domination of one vision over others -- in America's case, the domination of liberal free market principles of economics, democratic principles of politics, and a peaceful international system that supports these, over other visions that other nations and peoples may have. The present order will last only as long as those who favor it and benefit from it retain the will and capacity to defend it. If and when American power declines, the institutions and norms American power has supported will decline, too. Or they may collapse altogether as we transition into another kind of world order, or into disorder. We may discover then that the United States was essential to keeping the present world order together and that the alternative to American power was not peace and harmony but chaos and catastrophe -- which was what the world looked like right before the American order came into being. Robert Kagan is a senior fellow in Foreign Policy at Brookings. His most recent book is ""The World America Made."" Michele Flournoy: Congress, show political courage on defense cuts . After more than a decade of deficit spending, mounting national debt and the global financial crisis, we must shore up the U.S. economy as the foundation of our prosperity and security. This will require hard choices to bring government spending and revenues into balance while still investing in the long-term drivers of U.S. economic competitiveness. Republicans and Democrats have been unable to reach consensus on how to make these hard choices, bringing Congress to a standstill. The super-committee's failure to reach agreement on deficit reduction highlighted another more worrisome deficit -- one of political courage, vision and classic American pragmatism. These qualities are sorely needed at a time when partisan ideological discipline seems to have trumped the other nobler forms of discipline that have made this country great. In this context, Americans must decide what kind of military we need for the future. Michele Flournoy served as undersecretary of defense for policy in the Obama administration and is co-chair of the Obama campaign's national security advisory committee. Patrick Cronin: Ten big questions for Obama, Romney on Asia . Obama's rebalancing of priorities toward Asia is designed to reassure allies and new partners, without overly provoking a China vital to the global economy. For all its importance, however, the national political campaign has barely acknowledged the existence of Asian security. China has come under fire for currency manipulation and trading practices, and North Korea's Kim Jong Un managed to break into the campaign with his reckless missile launch. But the deeper, underlying issues of Asian security and their implications for the United States are awaiting more deliberate consideration. ... Obama and Romney administration policies for the Asia-Pacific would be apt to overlap more than they would differ. But when it comes to making hard choices and implementing policies, leaders matter. And here it is worth noting that President Obama's Asia team in a second term would probably lack its most able senior official: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has made her preference for returning to private life abundantly clear. Patrick M. Cronin is senior adviser and senior director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington. Stuart Gottlieb: What if U.S. stops policing the world? Obama's assertion that his recalibration of U.S. foreign policy -- centered on withdrawing U.S. troops from Mideast wars and leaning more on allies and the United Nations -- has awakened ""a new confidence in our leadership"" is without foundation. Like Great Britain in the 19th century, America since the turn of the 20th century has been the world's pivotal global power. Fair or not, in moments when America seemed unsure of its role in the world, the world noticed and reacted. There is no reason to believe now is different. Indeed, in many ways, looming opportunists are more obvious today than the 1930s, 1970s and 1990s. These include al Qaeda and other Islamist movements spinning U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan as strategic defeats; an emboldened Iran on the cusp of attaining nuclear weapons; and a rising China flexing its muscles in the South China Sea. To his credit, Romney has strongly warned against a world with more limited American leadership. He has also promised to reverse Obama's defense cuts and offer his own increases. But while Obama's approach may be shortsighted, Romney's would face an uphill battle against fiscal and popular sentiment. ... Whoever wins in November will confront not just an increasingly dangerous world, but also an increasingly isolationist public. The great challenge will be to convince the American people that robust U.S. leadership in the world remains vital to their security and prosperity and convince the world it remains unwavering. History shows that doing otherwise only raises the stakes down the line. Stuart Gottlieb teaches American foreign policy and international security at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, where he is also an affiliate of the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies. He worked as a foreign policy adviser and speechwriter to two senior Democratic senators and has worked on presidential campaigns for both Democratic and Republican candidates. Peter Bergen and Megan Braun: Drones are Obama's weapon of choice . Covert drone strikes are one of President Obama's key national security policies. He has already authorized 283 strikes in Pakistan, six times more than the number during President George W. Bush's eight years in office. As a result, the number of estimated deaths from the Obama administration's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the Bush administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618. Under Obama, the drone campaign, which during the Bush administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda, has undergone a quiet and unheralded shift to focus increasingly on killing Taliban foot soldiers. ... The number of drone strikes in 2011 fell by 40% from the record number of strikes in 2010. So far this year, the number of strikes has dropped by a further 25%. This is a welcome development. If the price of the drone campaign that increasingly kills only low-level Taliban is alienating 180 million Pakistanis -- that is too high a price to pay. While the drone campaign in Pakistan may be on the wane, it is amping up against the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. This year alone, Obama has authorized around 30 drone strikes in Yemen, while Bush only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst, is a director at the New America Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that seeks innovative solutions across the ideological spectrum.

"(CNN) -- Like former White House Press Secretary James Brady, my life has a ""before"" and an ""after."" For Jim Brady, who died Monday at 73, the ""before"" was the time leading up to March 30, 1981, when he was gravely wounded by an assassin aiming for President Ronald Reagan, who was also seriously wounded. For me, ""before"" was my life as a nurse, wife, and mother leading up to December 7, 1993, when a mentally disturbed gunman shot and killed my husband, Dennis, and severely wounded my son Kevin during a mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad. The ""after"" for Jim and for me has been a life colored by sadness and loss, but also driven by a cause bigger than both of us: ending violence caused by guns in this country. Jim Brady did not choose to be a leading advocate to prevent gun violence, but he embraced that role with courage and grace. Jim and his wonderfully steely wife, Sarah, founded the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and went to work to ensure that other individuals and families would not have to endure what they suffered after the 1981 shooting. Jim and Sarah have been leaders in the anti-gun violence effort for over 30 years and they have always handled their roles in a way that has earned them admirers across this country and around the world. Jim and Sarah have led the discussion on the role guns play in our society. I first met Jim Brady in late 1993 after the Long Island Railroad shooting. He and Sarah were very kind and provided me with hope for life after my shooting tragedy. Even while recovering from his severe head wound, he moved forward into his own new life of prodding America into addressing gun violence in a commonsense manner. Jim Brady had a great sense of humor and he used that humor to put people at ease when they met him. He never played the martyr. Jim and I were once discussing my son's recovery from his gunshot wounds and I told Jim that Kevin wanted to go skydiving. I had my doubts, but Jim thought it was a great goal. He said, on behalf of all shooting victims, ""We want to show people that we are still the person we were and we do things that people think we can't."" On his next birthday, Kevin went skydiving. James Brady's lasting legacy is, of course, the law that bears his name. The Brady Law, providing for background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases, has been in effect for more than 20 years. It has blocked more than 2 million gun sales to felons, fugitives and those suffering from mental illness. While the tragedies of Columbine, Virginia Tech, Newtown, and unfortunately many others demonstrate that we have more to do toward ending gun violence in America, Jim Brady leaves us with a law that has undoubtedly saved many lives. The Brady law continues to protect Americans, and the life of James Brady will continue to inspire all those faced with challenge and tragedy. My friend, Jim Brady, will be greatly missed.","Carolyn McCarthy: Like James Brady, her life had ""before"" and ""after"" a shooting tragedy .

"Margaret Thatcher was one of the defining personalities of the 20th century. In diplomacy, economics, society and as a woman, she had enormous impact at home and abroad. The test of a statesman is whether he or she changes the political weather. Thatcher, who won an unprecedented three consecutive general elections, certainly did that as UK prime minister from 1979 to 1990. What do you think about the loss of Britain's 'Iron Lady'? Share your thoughts on CNN iReport . But Thatcher not only changed the philosophy of her own party, the right-leaning Conservatives, she also forced other parties to change their whole approach to politics. Since Thatcher, all British mainstream parties have been believers, more or less, in the market economy. No other British politician during the second half of the 20th century had his or her own ""ism"" -- but Margaret Thatcher did with ""Thatcherism,"" defined by some as the application of a housewife's home budgeting to the national economy, coupled with the encouragement of home ownership and entrepreneurial capitalism. Her first achievement, easily forgotten now, was to go as far as she did in politics as a woman: She was, after all, the UK's first female prime minister. It was much harder then, and the best she had hoped for when she started her political career was to become chief finance minister as Chancellor of the Exchequer. When she entered 10 Downing Street, the prime minister's official residence, Thatcher headed a Cabinet in which most ministers had voted for her predecessor Edward Heath. Soon, in scribbled comments on the margins of Cabinet papers, the prime minister derided as ""wets"" those fellow ministers who were aghast at the budgets driven through by herself and Chancellor Geoffrey Howe. Her colleagues and advisers told her that she could not reform the trades' unions that had brought the country to its knees during the 1970s through industrial action and seen off the previous Conservative government. Only governments run by Labour - the Conservatives' main rivals for power -- could do that, they said. But Thatcher brought the unions under control and no government since has reversed the measures she took. Diplomats and ambassadors told her she could not get back from the European Union what she liked to refer to as ""our money,"" the contribution paid by the UK as part of its membership of Europe. But Thatcher ""handbagged"" her way through European summits till the UK secured a unique budget rebate which no prime minister has dared to negotiate away ever since. Unafraid to go to war, at home and in the Falklands . Above all, advisers told her there was no prospect of fighting a far-away war and winning back the Falklands Islands after Argentina's invasion in 1982 -- but she did. As the late Washington diplomat Lawrence Eagleburger later confirmed, it was U.S. officials' fear of her personal wrath which brought crucial intelligence help from Washington. With her program of selling off homes rented to tenants by regional councils and the privatization of state-controlled industries, Thatcher founded popular capitalism in Britain. Nobody would understand what was meant by ""Heathism"" or ""Wilsonianism"" or even ""Blairism,"" all creeds associated with previous prime ministers. But the British people still have a clear idea of what Thatcherism was all about. Thatcher took power in a period when most commentators and politicians had accepted that the only role for Britain was the least painful management possible of gentle decline. Instead, she restored a sense of national pride and purpose, enabling Britain to continue punching above its weight in international affairs. By taking on the power of the trades' unions, many say she gave managements back the power to manage. But in her revolutionary march through the institutions of British society, she didn't go as far as many Thatcher zealots would have liked, especially when it came to introducing the open market to health and education services. WATCH: Falklands War clouds Thatcher's legacy . Soviets respected her as 'The Iron Lady' Overseas, Thatcher became a true power broker on the international scene, seeing Russia's President Mikhail Gorbachev as a man with whom she could ""do business"" and re-charging her ideological batteries in exchanges with U.S. President Ronald Reagan. The ""Iron Lady,"" as the Moscow media christened her, became a world figure. Her fondness for Ronald Reagan did not stop her bawling him out in 1983 when he allowed American forces to invade Grenada, a member of the Commonwealth, or telling him off for (in her view) conceding too much to Gorbachev in arms negotiations. But she engendered respect rather than love, especially when she fought the rest of the Commonwealth by opposing economic sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The authority she gained did not mean there were not mistakes along the way. Some economists blame her governments for wrecking British manufacturing.  They say it was under Thatcher's financial ministers that chronic underspending on Britain's public services created problems that are still being rectified today. Critics contend that hers was not a tolerant society and she ensured that Britain's role in Europe become that of permanent irritant rather than profitable partner. Aided and abetted by sections of the media, it seemed Thatcher came to believe in the myth of her own invincibility. That was what led her into mistakes including the poll tax -- a charge that saw dukes and domestic cleaners paying the same local dues -- and increasingly shrill anti-Europeanism, which alarmed even her own party and eventually led them to discard a leader who had won them three consecutive elections. U.S. political figures react to Lady Thatcher's death . Proud but isolated . Thatcher's vote-winning drive had forced Britain's other parties to change their thinking to remain in touch with the electorate. But when the poll tax - a levy on individuals -- and her ""no, no, no"" response to Europe frightened her party into dumping her in 1990, they woke up the next morning and felt guilty about what they had done to their one-time heroine. Many Tories then adopted Euro-skepticism as a badge of loyalty to the discarded leader and made the party virtually unleadable under Thatcher's successor John Major. As her friend the novelist Jeffrey Archer put it, this turned the Conservative party into the only known example of a ""circular firing squad."" The appealing certainties of a ""conviction politician"" had turned a party that had been interested previously in the gaining and retention of power into an ideological sect more concerned with winning arguments than elections. During Thatcher's party leadership she purged her team of moderates who backed previous leaders like Ted Heath as well as other doubters. She quarreled with other strong figures like Chancellor Nigel Lawson and leadership rival Michael Heseltine, and she sought compliant government officials, inquiring in advance of key Civil Service appointments: ""Is he one of us?"" By the time she fell out with Howe, provoking him to deliver a ministerial resignation speech which began her own downfall, he was the only survivor of her first Cabinet. Thatcher's strength and drive made her an icon to conservatives in many parts of the world, especially in eastern Europe. She possessed the certainties of a tabloid newspaper editor, and her eagerness to see the power of central government reduced even made her a heroine to some of today's Tea Party enthusiasts in the United States. Few European politicians since have been so capable of drawing an American audience. The irony though is that while her election results show the pull she exerted through her strong leadership, her populist streak and her raising of the British profile, many Britons never really identified with the underlying values of the woman who became, both in her time as prime minister and in the years to come, a national icon.","Margaret Thatcher was the UK's first female prime minister .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not deny a report that he told U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro ""not to ever second guess me again"" on how to deal with Hamas, though he said the report did not reflect the general ""tone and substance"" of the calls. ""First let me make a general statement about our relationship with the United States,"" Netanyahu said in English on Saturday evening when an American journalist asked about the report from Matt Lee of the Associated Press. ""I think the United States has been terrific."" Netanyahu then praised President Barack Obama's ""unequivocal stand with Israel on our right to defend ourselves"" as well as the ""untiring efforts"" of Kerry. He also called Shapiro ""a great ambassador"" and thanked Congress for passing an additional $225 million to help Israel pay for its Iron Dome defense system. Some Israeli officials believed the attempt by Kerry and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to broker a cease-fire with Hamas -- the militant group that controls Gaza and which the U.S. government considers to be a terrorist organization -- was ill-conceived. Just 90 minutes into the 72-hour cease-fire, Israel accused Hamas of breaking it with an attack on Israeli soldiers through one of its tunnels. Though officials tend to sing from the same song sheet in public, there is a clear behind-the-scenes tension between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations over many issues, sources tell CNN -- including whether Israel's military operations in Gaza are excessive and resulting in preventable civilian deaths. In his news conference Saturday night, Netanyahu attempted to lump in the Associated Press report, which neither American nor Israeli officials have denied, with a supposed transcript of a phone call between Obama and Netanyahu that has been widely rejected as bogus by officials in both governments. ""There is a lot of support and we deeply appreciate it, and that is the substance of our relationship, that's the tone of our relationship, which gets to the question of these reports that are not only of my conversation with Ambassador Shapiro but also with the President that are full of incorrections, full of distortions and are wrong in both tone and substance.""","AP report said Benjamin Netanyahu had warned John Kerry on second-guessing him .

"""Remember: When the buying stops, the killing can, too."" That's retired NBA star Yao Ming appearing in a 2009 public service announcement aimed at stopping people in China from consuming shark-fin soup. Yao and other people sitting in a fancy restaurant push their shark dishes forward as a narrator explains that ""each year up to 70 million sharks are killed to end up"" in that delicacy. It's an important message, and an overlooked one. Much of the effort to combat the global illegal wildlife trade, which United for Wildlife values at $5 billion to $20 billion per year, has focused on additional park rangers and dismantling crime networks. That's important. Somewhat lost, however, have been efforts like those from Yao and WildAid, the group that produced that PSA for China, which are trying to unplug the wildlife trade from the demand that feeds it. Cut wildlife demand and rhinos, elephants and sharks live. There's evidence that tactic is seeing success. ""People said it was impossible to change China, but the evidence we are now getting says consumption of shark fin soup in China is down by 50% to 70% in the last two years,"" WildAid Executive Director Peter Knights told The Washington Post. ""It is a myth that people in Asia don't care about wildlife. ""Consumption is based on ignorance rather than malice."" I find that news encouraging, and it's one reason I'm overjoyed that a group called Education for Nature Vietnam has pledged to make a public service announcement about the pangolin to air in that country later this year or early next. After I featured the pangolin as part of CNN's Change the List project, readers donated more than $17,000 to that group in hopes it would make such a PSA. The group, based in Hanoi, Vietnam, had said it would need $5,000 to cover production costs. The ad wouldn't be happening without you. The pangolin is thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. Few people in the West know it exists, but it's trafficked by the ton for its scales, which are used in traditional medicine, and for its meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. The Vietnamese ad likely will focus on curbing demand for pangolin scales, said Doug Hendrie, adviser of Education for Nature Vietnam's wildlife crime and investigations unit. The extra CNN reader donations not used to create that ad will be used to boost the group's efforts to break up the pangolin trade and out restaurants and medicine shops that are illegally selling pangolin products. Hendrie said he was overwhelmed by the response. He called his wife at 3 a.m. to tell her about the flood of donations. Education for Nature Vietnam has produced and commissioned a number of public service announcements aimed at curbing local demand for wildlife, but never one for the pangolin, which generally doesn't get the funding of the more ""charismatic"" wildlife species, either because it is little known or isn't thought to be as cute. The group's PSAs try to create associate social shame or stigma with the consumption of wildlife products, Hendrie said. One, for example, shows a business meeting in which a man gives his colleague tiger bone as a gift. He looks up to see his co-workers are leaving the room. ""Using tiger bone glue won't impress anyone,"" the ad says. ""Don't embarrass yourself."" ""We are extremely happy to see the response,"" he wrote in an e-mail to me, ""and surprised as well."" I'll second that. I'm humbled by your generosity. The world is a weirder and more interesting place because the pangolin exists. And your kindness is upping the odds this creature will survive.

"Remember Syria's chemical weapons?  Yes, those, the ones the Syrian regime agreed to give up after President Obama threatened to bomb. All of the ""priority one"" the most dangerous of those weapons, were supposed to be gone by December 31 last year. They're not. Almost all of them -- more than 95% -- are still in Syria despite a commitment by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to get rid of his deadly arsenal. The deal to remove Syria's stock of WMD was the one tangible accomplishment of the Obama administration's approach to the Middle East's multiple crises. Now that deal looks to be failing, even as red flags also start flying along the path to a deal with Iran. It's hard to escape the impression that Iran and its close ally, Syria, are toying with the U.S. America is earnestly seeking a diplomatic solution. And we should all hope diplomacy succeeds in securing an agreement that stops the carnage in Syria and one that prevents Iran from becoming a greater threat to its neighbors. But there is a reason these efforts are already running into trouble. Secretary of State John Kerry is valiantly pursuing the suit-and-tie approach to peace, but Kerry is handicapped by the growing perception that Obama will not use military force under any circumstances. The U.S. doesn't need to release bombs to show it is powerful. What it needs to do is remind its adversaries, its enemies, that it has options beyond the well-appointed rooms of hotels along Lake Geneva. Obama can do this by speaking directly and firmly about those choices. That alone would go a long way in reshaping some points of views, and could produce results. If it doesn't, more concrete steps would be required, from increasing material support for specific anti-al-Assad forces to a tightening of sanctions against Iran and other steps. Diplomats can help concentrate the mind of their interlocutors when the people on the other side of the table worry about the possible cost of failure. This is true of Syria's al-Assad, who has heard Obama's threats on the use of chemical weapons starting in the summer of 2012, and is still playing games with America while relentlessly slaughtering and starving his people. And it is true about Iran, which just heard Obama during the State of the Union threaten to veto a plan to set the stage now for additional sanctions against Iran if negotiations fail in the next six months. Iranian officials presumably also heard the president state what so many have stopped believing: that he is prepared ""to exercise all options to make sure Iran does not build a nuclear weapon."" Iran foreign minister says Obama's remarks are for ""domestic consumption"" The more we hear from the Iranians, the less likely it seems that a successful agreement can be reached. After CNN's Fareed Zakaria talked to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani last week, he concluded there's a ""train wreck"" on its way in negotiations. The U.S. is moving forward on the assumption that a deal would involve the dismantling of some key nuclear facilities, but Rouhani, the moderate face of the Islamist Republic, made it ""categorically, specifically and unequivocally"" clear that Iran has no intention of ever rolling back its nuclear program. On Syria, I had heard rumors that the removal of its most terrifying weapons was not going as scheduled. Then an anonymous source told Reuters that the regime has delivered a dismal 4.1% of the 1,300 tons of toxic agents it has reported, ""and there is no sign of more,"" on the way. Then the U.S. confirmed it. On Thursday, Ambassador Robert Mikulak, who heads the U.S. delegation to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, told the group that Syria is ignoring the timeline for removal of banned weapons and displaying ""a 'bargaining mentality' rather than a security mentality."" In addition, he said, there is little progress on Syria's commitment to destroy its chemical weapons production facilities. If Syria's games over its chemical weapons sound familiar -- agreements followed by ""misunderstandings"" and endless delays -- it is because we see much the same already unfolding with Iran. Iran's President and foreign minister are well versed in their communications strategy with the West. They are charming and fluent, speaking directly to Western publics who would like nothing better than to be done with the threat of a confrontation. And how great it would be to truly resolve the issue diplomatically. Hope, however, is not a strategy any more than closing your eyes when you don't like what you see, as when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted that in the Geneva agreement the ""world powers surrendered"" to Iran. That's when the White House dismissed the worrisome statement as a play for a domestic audience. Since then, however, one after another Iranian official has maintained they have no intention of taking apart any of their nuclear program. Without destroying any centrifuges, reactors, or other facilities, Iran can negotiate with the West, and receive political, diplomatic and economic benefits from the loosening of sanctions, as it already has. And then, as top Iranian officials have said, it can reverse any freeze and resume high-level enrichment in 24 hours. That's the vow from the top nuclear negotiator and the foreign minister. Making matters worse, much worse, we have just learned that American intelligence officials believe Iran has essentially already reached the ""nuclear breakout"" capability it sought. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told Congress this week that Iran has made ""technical progress in a number of areas -- including uranium enrichment, nuclear reactors, and ballistic missiles -- from which it could draw if it decided to build missile-deliverable nuclear weapons."" In other words, he concluded, the only thing between Iran and nuclear weapons is a political decision to build the bomb. Everything else is already in place. That extraordinary revelation received little attention in the U.S., where the headlines were consumed with the crisis in ice-logged Atlanta. In other places, the news was cause for alarm. ""Heaven help us,"" tweeted a respected Israeli journalist, ""Iran can now build and deliver nukes."" How is it possible that Iran and Syria are getting away with this? Iran and Syria are not the only countries convinced that the U.S. will not take military action. Saudi Arabia apparently has reached much the same conclusion. After his 2012 red lines became blurred, the deal to get rid of al-Assad's chemical weapons allowed Obama to claim he had succeeded in showing consequences for their use, even if al-Assad stayed in place and the killing continued. But now it looks as if essentially nothing has changed. Except that tens of thousands more have died. To support American diplomacy, Obama needs to erase that image of a weak America. Again, there is no need to launch attacks and deploy troops. But there is a need to show to America's enemies they cannot play the U.S. for a fool. The President needs to assert convincingly that he will be able to exercise power if that becomes necessary. Nothing would be more helpful to the chances for diplomatic success.","Syria has only removed about 4% of priority one chemical weapons, U.S. says .

"Oscar Pistorius is depressed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and is a suicide risk, the doctors who spent a month evaluating his mental health concluded. But he does not appear to have a history of abnormal aggression or psychopathic tendencies linked to ""rage-type murders in intimate relations,"" they found. The conclusions, read at the athlete's murder trial on Wednesday, are a ""slam-dunk for the defense,"" CNN legal expert Kelly Phelps said. The double amputee sprinter is on trial for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in his home last year. He admits killing her but says he mistook her for a burglar and thought he was defending himself. The prosecution says the two had an argument and he killed her intentionally. The psychiatric report seemed to suggest that Pistorius's version of events was plausible. ""When Mr. Pistorius's appraisal of the situation is that he might be physically threatened, a fear response follows that might seem extraordinary when viewed from the perspective of a normal bodied person, but normal in the context of a disabled person with his history,"" the doctors found. One of the questions Judge Thokozile Masipa must consider in determining her verdict is whether Pistorius behaved reasonably in the circumstances. Several witnesses have testified that Pistorius tends to arm himself and go towards danger, rather than away from it, when he thinks he is under threat. The track star's specialist sports doctor testified Wednesday after defense lawyer Barry Roux read the mental health report. Wayne Derman said that Pistorius was ""hypervigilant."" Mentally sound . The trial restarted Monday after a monthlong break when Pistorius was evaluated by mental health experts at the prosecution's request. They found he was not mentally incapacitated when he shot and killed Steenkamp. An independent panel of doctors said that Pistorius was, at the time he shot Steenkamp, not mentally ill or incapacitated in any way that would make him ""criminally not responsible of the offenses charged."" The report added that ""Mr. Pistorius was capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act."" Had the doctors deemed Pistorius mentally incapacitated during the shooting, the trial would have immediately ended in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. Verdict . At the trial's conclusion, Judge Masipa will have to decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or killed Steenkamp intentionally. If she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to a prison term ranging from 15 years to life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion.

"NSA leaker Edward Snowden accused New Zealand Prime Minister John Key of misleading the public over the country's spying activities, as the nation's explosive election campaign reached a crescendo Monday. The claims were made at a packed public meeting in Auckland's Town Hall, organized by the German tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom, that was billed as a ""Moment of Truth"" for the election campaign. Dotcom had hyped the event as a ""game-changer"" that could alter the course of this Saturday's general election. Appearing onstage alongside Dotcom were journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the NSA leaks story, lawyer Robert Amsterdam, and Laila Harre, the leader of the political party founded by Dotcom. Snowden, who is evading U.S. authorities in Moscow, and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is confined to Ecuador's embassy in London, spoke via video-link. Drawing on information contained in Snowden's NSA leaks and elaborating on articles they had published earlier in the day, Snowden and Greenwald said New Zealand was involved in mass electronic surveillance activities as part of the Five Eyes intelligence partnership with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The pair said their information showed that New Zealanders were subject to mass electronic surveillance via the ""XKeyscore"" software tool that New Zealand intelligence agency the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) shared with the NSA. They claimed this directly contradicted Key's assertion that ""there is not, and never has been, mass surveillance of New Zealanders undertaken by the GCSB."" Rather, Snowden wrote: ""If you live in New Zealand, you are being watched."" He also claimed during his remarks that the NSA operated two facilities in New Zealand. READ MORE: What is XKeyscore? Key said in a statement he would not address the XKeyscore matter, saying ""we don't discuss the specific programs the GCSB may, or may not use. ""But the GCSB does not collect mass metadata on New Zealanders, therefore it is clearly not contributing such data to anything or anyone."" Key has previously told reporters that he and the head of GCSB would resign if the spy agency were found to have conducted mass surveillance. Project 'Speargun' Greenwald said Key had also misled the New Zealand public when the government was seeking to pass controversial, beefed-up spying laws last year, by giving assurances the new legislation would not allow mass metadata collection on the New Zealand public. On the contrary, claimed Greenwald, the bill, which narrowly passed into law, was designed to enable just that. Leaked NSA documents appeared to show that at around the time Key was making his public assurances around the planned legislation, the GCSB was implementing the first phase of a mass surveillance program code-named ""Speargun,"" Greenwald said. ""Speargun,"" which would have involved tapping into the Southern Cross undersea telecommunications cable to harvest internet data, would have required the expanded laws to operate, and would have constituted ""the greatest expansion of GCSB spying activities in decades,"" he wrote. The claims prompted the government to acknowledge the existence of plans for the ""cable access surveillance program"" for the first time. In a statement, Key said the government had begun work on presenting a business case for the project, described as a ""cyber security protection initiative."" But the project was ultimately shelved, he said. ""The business case for the highest form of protection was never completed or presented to cabinet and never approved. Put simply, it never happened,"" he said. Anthony Briscoe, chief executive of Southern Cross Cables, released a statement saying there was ""no facility by the NSA, the GCSB or anyone else on the Southern Cross cable network."" War of words . The conflicting claims over the government's spying activities have sparked a harsh war of words between Key and Greenwald, with the prime minister labeling the latter a ""clown"" and ""Dotcom's little henchman"" in remarks to reporters. ""If this loser's going to come to town and try to tell me, five days before an election, staying at the Dotcom mansion... he's doing anything other than Dotcom's bidding? Please don't insult me with that,"" Key told a radio interviewer. In response, Greenwald told the Auckland Town Hall audience it was a new experience to arrive in a foreign country and be ""publicly maligned and attacked by the nation's head of state using the most adolescent set of epithets imaginable."" He had not been called a loser ""since I was, like, 14 years old,"" he said. Dotcom in politics . A New Zealand resident since 2010, Dotcom is fighting a battle in New Zealand courts to avoid extradition to the United States, where he faces major criminal copyright charges relating to his now-defunct cloud storage site, Megaupload. The site is alleged to have facilitated the piracy of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of films and music. At odds with the government since his 2012 arrest, Dotcom has gradually emerged as a significant player on the fringe of New Zealand politics. While as a non-citizen, he cannot run for office, he has formed a political party, the Internet Party, which has campaigned on a platform of Internet freedom, digital rights and opposing government electronic surveillance. The party has formed an alliance with the Maori nationalist Mana Party which, on current polling, looks set to win two seats in parliament. READ MORE: Who is Kim Dotcom? Dotcom himself was subjected to illegal surveillance by the GCSB prior to his arrest. The surveillance was unlawful at the time, as the GCSB was not permitted to spy on New Zealand residents, although those laws have since been changed. The seizure of his electronic data by U.S. authorities has also been ruled illegal by a New Zealand court. In his fight against extradition, Dotcom has argued he is a victim of a conspiracy by the New Zealand and U.S. governments and Hollywood. He claims his arrest in a military-style police raid over criminal copyright charges is a clear-cut example of prosecutorial overreach, and a case study in the way in which the surveillance state was being harnessed to pursue commercial interests rather than protect citizens from terrorism. READ MORE -- Kim Dotcom writes: 'Why New Zealand is a slave to U.S. interests' He has repeatedly outlined his beliefs that the New Zealand government decided to grant him residence in 2010 -- over the objections of intelligence officials -- only in order to facilitate his extradition to the United States. He claims he was used as a bargaining chip in the New Zealand government's negotiations with Hollywood executives over the filming of ""The Hobbit"" trilogy. Warner Brothers were threatening to relocate the production of the films in a spat over New Zealand's employment laws, at around the same time in October 2010 at which Dotcom's residency application was being considered. Key has previously rejected those claims, saying he did not know of Dotcom's existence until more than a year later, immediately prior to his arrest. Smoking gun? But in the lead-up to his event Monday night, Dotcom released to the New Zealand Herald newspaper what he claimed was an email between Hollywood executives which backed his version of events. He gave no account of the email's provenance, but the newspaper reported it the email was one of the main bombshells Dotcom had planned for his ""Moment of Truth"" event. Dated October 27, 2010, it purports to be from Warner Brothers chairman and chief executive Kevin Tsujihara to a senior executive at the Motion Picture Association of America, the lobby group for Hollywood studios. Titled ""MegaRIP,"" the purported email read: . ""We had a really good meeting with the Prime Minister. He's a fan and we're getting what we came for. Your groundwork in New Zealand is paying off. I see strong support for our anti-piracy effort. ""John Key told me in private that they are granting Dotcom residency despite pushback from officials about his criminal past. His AG will do everything in his power to assist us with our case. VIP treatment and then a one-way ticket to Virginia."" But Warner Brothers, the MPAA and Key's office all rejected the email's authenticity. ""Kevin Tsujihara did not write or send the alleged email, and he never had any such conversation with Prime Minister Key,"" Paul McGuire, Warner Brothers' senior vice president of worldwide corporate communications, told CNN via email. Warner Brothers is owned by Time Warner which also owns Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN. Key released a statement saying: ""The conversation allegedly reported on in the email did not take place. People will see this for what it is."" Dotcom did not raise the subject of the email during the Town Hall event, and did not address questions on it at a subsequent press conference, other than to say he believed it ""to be 100 per cent true."" Hone Harawira, the leader of the Mana Party, has lodged a complaint with parliament's Speaker to investigate the email. 'Dirty politics' New Zealand's election campaign has been unusually controversial this year. While Key's National Party has a strong lead in the polls, it has been hit by a string of scandals, following the publication of a book alleging the government was outsourcing its political smears to a controversial ""attack blogger."" The affair led to the resignation of a senior minister and two official inquiries being launched into allegations raised.

"An independent assessment of National Security Agency surveillance ordered by President Barack Obama recommends a controversial program aimed at collecting  Americans' electronic communications remain in place. But the effort predominantly covering so-called metadata relating to phone records and e-mail must have tighter constraints and greater transparency, according to the report released on Wednesday by the presidential Review Group on Intelligence. Some 40 recommendations -- considered modest in scope -- were offered by the group on how the United States should continue collecting and storing data domestically and abroad. Among them are calls for greater judicial oversight and more public transparency. ""Because our adversaries operate through the use of complex communications technologies, the National Security Agency, with its impressive capabilities and talented officers, is indispensable to keeping our country and our allies safe and secure,"" said the report's executive summary. The panel was created amid a political firestorm that followed leaks last summer by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. The disclosures triggered outrage among civil libertarians and many members of Congress, who considered the degree of data collection an overreach of post-9/11 anti-terror efforts. Leaks about surveillance and a secret court that works with the NSA put enormous pressure on Obama, who came into office promising a more transparent government. 5 questions about the NSA ruling . Key members of Congress are considering changes to programs under the Patriot Act law to restrict NSA snooping programs. ""The message is very clear,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said following the report's release. ""NSA, you've gone too far."" Leahy mentioned the section in law allowing telephone data collection ""was not essential to preventing attacks,"" according to the report. That directly contradicts national security officials, who have said the authority had helped thwart terror plots both in the United States and abroad. ""Just because we can collect massive amounts of data doesn't mean we should do so,"" Leahy said. Read the report here . The review panel said that when government officials consider national security risks, they should also consider risks to privacy, freedom, civil liberties, relationships and trade with other nations. It also recommended new limits on spying on foreigners and foreign leaders following controversy around disclosures of U.S. snooping on overseas presidents, like Germany's Angela Merkel. The panel said intelligence officials should weigh if a foreign leader is believed to be duplicitous, if another country has a cooperative relationship with the United States and the political and diplomatic fallout if the leader became aware of such surveillance. Heads of state in Brazil and Germany have been among those expressing recent outrage at alleged surveillance by the U.S. government in their countries. The independent panel said spying on foreigners should only be conducted to protect national security and U.S. allies, not directed for economic issues such as trade secret theft. Snowden's open letter offers to help Brazil investigate NSA surveillance . Mike Morrell, the former acting CIA director and member of the panel, said the recommendations are not ""in any way disarming"" the intelligence community by removing tools needed to protect the United States. Fellow panel member Richard Clarke, a former top counter-terrorism official in two administrations, said the recommendations also are not a signal that the fight against terrorism has ended. Additionally, Obama will deliver a speech likely in January on the path forward following the report recommendations, which include presidential oversight of monitoring of foreign leaders and agreements with nations like France and Germany on what is acceptable and what is not. Obama met on Wednesday with members of the review group to discuss their findings. He has to decide which of the recommendations will be accepted, which could be revised and which will be rejected. Obama vowed this month to find ways of reforming the NSA, though he also defended the agency's work. Release of the findings came two days after a federal judge in Washington ruled preliminarily that NSA data collection of telephone metadata was probably unconstitutional on privacy grounds. Opinion: Who broke the law, Snowden or the NSA? The group's other recommendations included: . -- Subjecting U.S. citizens and foreigners to the same privacy standards . -- Urging that the U.S. government support, and not undermine, encryption standards . -- Tightening classified information protection, including more monitoring and routine vetting of people who access classified information. And background investigations should be done by government employees or by a nonprofit private company, not for-profit firms criticized for not thoroughly vetting contractors hired by the NSA, like Snowden, the group advised.","Independent report recommends metadata collection should have more safeguards .

"When the ""Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act"" went into effect 20 years ago this month, America took a historic stand against gun violence. It was the first federal law to require that licensed dealers refer every gun sale to law enforcement for a background check. The law honored my husband, Jim Brady, who had been shot in the head in 1981 by John Hinckley Jr, a mentally ill man who attempted to assassinate President Reagan. The shooting left Jim permanently impaired physically and cognitively. Since February 28, 1994, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, background checks have stopped more than 2 million gun purchases by ""prohibited purchasers""  like convicted felons, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill and fugitives—people who we all agree should not have guns. It's easy to imagine how many lives were saved and how many disabling injuries prevented thanks to Brady background checks. But a lot has changed over the past two decades, and people who wouldn't pass a background check have found other ways to procure guns easily through unlicensed sales at gun shows or on the Internet, where background checks are not required. Opinion: The man who made people talk about guns . The corporate gun lobby would like us to think these unlicensed sales are transactions between family members and hunting buddies, but the truth is that thousands of guns are sold legally each day without a background check, thereby potentially putting guns directly in the hands of criminals. In fact, websites like Armslist.com boast upward of 70,000 listings from private sellers,  many touting ""No background check"" as a selling feature. As a result, an estimated 40% of gun sales today occur without a Brady background check.  Many of these sales have deadly consequences. Take Zina Daniel, a victim of domestic violence who procured a restraining order against her estranged husband, making him unable to pass a background check. He bought a semiautomatic handgun from a private seller online, where he didn't need a background check. He used that gun to kill Zina and two others and wound four more at a nail salon. Let's think about background checks in another way.  Imagine if Zina's husband were on the no fly list and was one of 40% of airline passengers the Transportation Security Administration allowed to fly without undergoing a security screening. Would Americans feel safe in the air in this scenario? Not likely. Yet that is precisely the percentage of gun purchases made daily without a background check. Opinion: The warrior, the hero, the 'Bear' So what's the solution?  Congress needs to finish the job the Brady law so effectively started to ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of people who should not have them. Congress must pick up where it left off last April when, to Jim's and my great disappointment, Senate legislation to expand Brady background checks fell short. The bill received a majority 54 votes, including the support of six ""A-rated"" National Rifle Association senators, two of whom were the lead sponsors.  The American people support this legislation. In fact, 90% of Americans support universal background checks covering all online sales and gun shows. Three out of four NRA members and 80% of gun owners agree that the scope of background checks needs to be expanded. In 2013, after the horrific tragedy of the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, eight states passed meaningful gun regulations.  These laws could save lives and prevent injuries. Let's keep moving forward.  Let's finish the job, expand Brady background checks and help keep guns out of the hands of the wrong people.","""Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act"" went into effect 20 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Most Americans had never heard of the Khorasan group until this week, when President Barack Obama announced that U.S. airstrikes in Syria had targeted the ""seasoned al-Qaeda operatives."" U.S. officials said that the Khorasan group was actively plotting to conduct an attack in the United States or Europe. ""We can't say that we definitely disrupted their plots"" against the West with the U.S. airstrikes, a senior Obama administration official told one of us, but ""there is a decent chance we have"" because ""their communications are interrupted"" and members of the group were killed in the strikes. The sudden public emergence of the Khorasan group as a threat underlines the fact that the global jihadist movement, which at the time of the 9/11 attacks was largely concentrated in Afghanistan, has morphed and metastasized a great deal since then. Which raises the question: What are the dimensions of the overall global jihadist threat today? During the Cold War the U.S. intelligence community knew in detail the size of the Soviet military and the disposition of its forces across Eastern Europe and Russia. In the long, twilight struggle against al Qaeda, its affiliates, splinter groups, and like-minded organizations -- armed forces that fight without uniforms and often in secret -- such an accounting is harder to do. A good example of this is the shifting estimates of ISIS's strength. ISIS, which split off from al Qaeda earlier this year, ""can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria,"" a CIA spokesman told CNN last week. This is as much as three times previous estimate of ISIS's strength; U.S. officials initially estimated ISIS had around 10,000 fighters. To see if we could come up with some kind of estimate for the total number of militants fighting with jihadist groups around the world, we asked a range of experts to estimate the number of fighters belonging to various al Qaeda-affiliated or like-minded groups. These estimates appear in a report, which we helped to author, that was released this week by the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project, a successor to the 9/11 Commission. If we tally up the low and high estimates for all these groups, we can begin to have a sense of the total number of jihadist militants that are part of formal organizations around the globe. We found that on the low end, an estimated 85,000 men are fighting in jihadist groups around the world; on the high end, 106,000. How did we arrive at those numbers? -- We assess that core al Qaeda, whose members are largely located in the Pakistani tribal regions along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, has been devastated in recent years by CIA drone strikes and now numbers only in the low hundreds of militants. -- Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which operates out of Yemen, poses perhaps the most immediate threat to the U.S. homeland. AQAP had 300 original members in 2010, expanding to around 1,000 by 2012, and membership has remained steady since then, according to Gregory Johnsen, whose book ""The Last Refuge: Yemen, al-Qaeda, and America's War in Arabia,"" is the authoritative history of AQAP. -- Jabhat al Nusra, the al Qaeda affiliate operating in Syria and northern Iraq, is estimated to be smaller than ISIS, with which it is presently at war. Aaron Zelin, who tracks Nusra for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, estimates that Nusra has 5,000 to 10,000 fighters. (The Khorasan group is only a small subset of Nusra). -- Al-Shabaab, al-Qaeda's Somalia affiliate, once controlled much of that country, but it has suffered a number of battlefield losses over the past three years. Ken Munkaus, a professor of political science at Davidson College and a specialist on Somalia, believes that the most reliable estimates for the group put the number of fighters between 3,000 and 5,000. -- French military intervention in Mali in 2013 largely defeated the forces of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and its splinter groups, which had taken over half of the country, but AQIM countinues to operate in Algeria, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. AQIM's main appeal is its wealth, as its focus on kidnappings for ransom has brought in an estimated $90 million. Hannah Armstrong, who studies North African militant groups for New America's International Security Program, estimates the total number of AQIM-associated fighters in the Sahel region of North Africa at about 3,000. -- Counterterrorism operations in 2009 and 2010 have reduced Jemaah Islamiya (JI), al Qaeda's Southeast Asian affiliate. In the period after 2010, ""JI was severely crippled and could only stage small-scale attacks"" according to Zachary Abuza, a leading JI expert at the National Defense University. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) assesses: ""Southeast Asian governments since 2002 have arrested more than 300 suspected terrorists, significantly degrading JI's network."" About 100 Southeast Asians have reportedly traveled to fight with ISIS, which could reinvigorate Southeast Asian extremist networks. The threat to Western interests, of course, doesn't just come from those groups that are formally affiliated with al Qaeda. -- Though the Pakistani Taliban is predominantly focused on fighting in Pakistan, the group has repeatedly threatened the United States. The group was responsible for Faisal Shahzad's failed car bomb attack in Times Square on May 1, 2010. According to National Defense University Professor Hassan Abbas, who has written extensively on the Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban have anywhere from 17,000 to 22,000 foot soldiers. --The influx of Pakistani Taliban militants into Afghanistan --under the leadership of Pakistani Taliban commander Mullah Maulana Fazullah, who currently resides in Afghanistan --adds more fighters to an already robust Taliban force: U.S. government officials estimate the number of Afghan Taliban members at around 35,000. -- Since 2011, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) has lost several senior leaders, yet the group continues to pose a threat to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The IMU claimed responsibility for the June 2014 attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, which killed 28 people. The U.S. State Department estimated that as of April 2014, the IMU had about 200 to 300 members and that its splinter, the Islamic Jihad Union, has 100 to 200 members. -- Since its creation in 2002, Boko Haram has only attacked Western interests once, when it bombed the U.N. office in Abuja, Nigeria, in August 2011. The group has consistently shown little inclination for attacking Western targets and is principally interested in putting Nigeria under its version of Sharia law. Dr. Peter Lewis, the director of African Studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies has estimated that Boko Haram had several thousand supporters and at least 300 armed men. (We excluded from our overall account the armed forces of Hezbollah and Hamas, because these organizations also engage in conventional politics and governing and also do not attack American targets -- all facts that make them at odds with al Qaeda and its affiliates and splinter groups). The vast majority of the estimated 85,000 to 106,000 militants fighting with militant jihadist groups around the world are fighting for purely local reasons, for instance, trying to install Sharia law in northern Nigeria or trying to impose Taliban rule on Pakistan and Afghanistan, while only a small number of these militants are focused on attacking the West. By historical standards this is hardly a major threat. At the end of the Cold War, Soviet and other Warsaw Pact countries could muster around 6 million men to fight in a war against the West, a number that is some 60 times greater than the total number of militants estimated to be fighting for jihadist organizations today. And, of course, the Soviets had a vast supply of nuclear-armed, land-based missiles, nuclear-armed submarines and nuclear-armed bombers and many other highly sophisticated weapons systems that jihadist organizations have never acquired and are quite unlikely to. The only reasonable conclusion to draw is that the threat posed by jihadist organizations around the globe is quite inconsequential when compared with what the West faced in the past century.","Peter Bergen, Emily Schneider: Khorason shows jihad groups metastasizing.

"President Barack Obama is loading new missions on the U.S. military with fast-expanding mandates and no certain end dates as he grapples with the threats posed by ISIS and Ebola. Evolving operations in the Middle East and west Africa are causing some supporters to ask whether the president, a notoriously reluctant warrior dedicated to ending foreign entanglements and getting troops home, has changed his mind. By committing the U.S. military to two new crises, with no clear exit strategy, Obama risks the same perilous slide into ""mission creep"" that hounded some predecessors, who got sucked ever deeper into wars in Vietnam, Somalia and Iraq. Already, there are mounting questions about whether the strategy is working. A former top U.S. counterterror official told CNN Tuesday that the ""imminent threat"" from one of the groups targeted in an initial wave of airstrikes in Syria hasn't abated. When Obama announced America's new war in August, he said U.S. air strikes would only take place ""if necessary"" and only in Iraq to save civilians from massacres by the marauding Sunni radicals and to protect U.S. personnel. Yet less than three months later, in the newly branded Operation ""Inherent Resolve,"" U.S. warplanes have blasted ISIS fighters, vehicles and supply lines in Syria, as well as Iraq. There are more than 1,400 troops in Iraq and hundreds more aboard ships and in nearby countries carrying out airstrikes. U.S. attack helicopters have gone into battle against ISIS in Anbar province. It is indisputable that the campaign has widened. US planes this weekend intensified air strikes on the besieged Syrian town of Kobani, and dropped arms and ammunition to Kurdish forces locked in a struggle for the strategic choke point near the Turkish border. There is every sign the anti-ISIS operation will go on for years. And there is no clear idea of what success will look like, despite Obama's vow to destroy ISIS's ""network of death."" As for Ebola, the Pentagon didn't have a role when the outbreak exploded in west Africa. But soon Obama — warning the deadly epidemic could spark a national security crisis if left unchecked, announced plans to send 3,000 troops to build treatment centers and health care infrastructure. All this came with a caveat that no American soldiers would go near sick patients. Soon, the Pentagon said the number of troops could go as high as 4,000. Then last week, Obama issued an executive order clearing the way for reservists to be called up to fight Ebola if necessary, amid increasing frustration in the White House that US allies have not stepped up. PHOTO GALLERY: U.S., Arab nations attack ISIS in Syria . On Sunday, the mission expanded further when the Pentagon revealed it was standing up a rapid reaction squad to leap into action should more Ebola cases emerge on the U.S. mainland — opening the possibility that military officers would be exposed to infected patients for the first time. Deepening U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria seems to be the result of a reluctant conclusion by Obama that the burgeoning threat from ISIS requires a wider US response. But on Ebola, the president is personally and actively demanding the military get more involved. The concept of an emergency treatment team only emerged after Obama ordered more action from his administration in crisis meetings last week as political pressure spiked amid infections on U.S. soil, two senior administration officials told CNN. The White House is walking a fine line. Obama faces skepticism from the Democratic left, which is skittish about new wars and warnings from Republicans that he isn't hawkish enough. The administration insists there will be no ""boots on the ground"" in the ISIS conflict and notes an international coalition is helping to bear the burden. Although US involvement may be deepening, it pales in comparison to the 150,000 strong U.S. garrison in Iraq when Obama took office, officials say. Top Pentagon officials privately say the new mission list exposes the folly of current budget cuts at a time when the military is also being asked to bolster Obama's pivot to Asia and strengthen NATO to counter Russia. Top defense officials often cry wolf but they say this time they're not playing politics, and warn that in future they may not be able to answer every time the president calls. It is ironic that Obama is parrying questions on mission creep, after being hammered by critics for ""leading from behind"" on Libya and for setting timelines for troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan rather than making drawdowns conditional on battlefield gains. But presidents find themselves sucked deeper into military operations for many reasons — including reverses in the field, temptations brought on by the unique capabilities of the US military or the realization that local allies are deficient. Sometimes, they just have their hands forced by rising political heat back home. Some or all of these conditions may apply to both the Ebola and Iraq operations. But in the ISIS campaign at least, it's clear those in Obama's inner circle have the dangers of Middle East mission creep on their minds. The message is clearly that Obama will use force if necessary — but not beyond certain points. ""We make no apologies for being deliberate about the use of force, particularly when it engages the United States in conflicts in a region like the Middle East,"" deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" on Monday. ""The American people want a president who is going to think hard before making those decisions who .... makes sure he is drawing from the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan."" Top officials pushed back hard against the idea that U.S. ground troops will inevitably be drawn into the fight, and comments by Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that US advisors could see combat advisors on the ground alongside Iraqi troops. ""That's not come up the chain to anybody at the White House. And I don't anticipate that it will,"" National Security Advisor Susan Rice said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on October 12. CENTCOM commander Gen. Lloyd Austin rejected the idea that U.S. operations around Kobani represented a stretching of the military's orders, saying last week that he was simply exploiting a chance to hit ISIS forces massed in the town. ""I think that we really have to remain focused on the first task, and that is to help the Iraqis restore security and stability inside of the country of Iraq; restore their borders; regenerate forces to be able to help them do that,"" Austin said. But there are concerns in Obama's political base that things are already going too far. Anna Galland, executive director of progressive group MoveOn.org said that what started off as a humanitarian mission has morphed out of all recognition. ""Our members are very concerned by the prospect of a slippery slope in Iraq and Syria back into another open ended war,"" she said. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) told CNN that Americans were war weary and not ready for another widening conflict. ""We cannot allow the U.S. to be dragged into another endless war. Since the start of US military action in Iraq and Syria, I have been gravely concerned with mission creep,"" Lee said Tuesday. But Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense, said he believed the limited nature of the campaign would mitigate against public war fatigue. ""I think now we have recognized that no one is going to transform the Middle East,"" Korb said, comparing the ISIS operation to US anti-terror strikes in Yemen and Somalia. ""We just deal with the immediate threats and keep them from getting out of hand.""","President Obama risks getting sucked into deeper and deeper conflicts .

"Fourth-grade teacher by day, adjunct professor and mother by night, Renee Longshore keeps a strict budget and pulls a second income all in the name of teaching. With her husband's two jobs -- he's also a fourth-grade teacher and an adjunct professor -- the master's-educated couple makes four incomes. But, money is tight for this family of six. While Longshore's passion for teaching children helps her overlook her modest life, she sometimes resents her job. She feels under-appreciated by parents at times and like her profession isn't respected. ""My paycheck does not reflect my expertise,"" she wrote on CNN iReport. ""The minimal esteem shown is not warranted, considering my formal schooling and experience. ... But I teach, because that is who I am."" Despite administration frustrations and poor classroom conditions -- and for Chicago teachers, a weeklong strike --  why do they do it? CNN asked teachers to share their perspectives about the sacrifices they make, and the motivations for teaching. These are five of their stories: . Inspired by her teachers . The Longshore family's best electronics are hand-me-downs from when the school replaces them with new, grant-funded equipment. The laptop that Longshore uses in the classroom is also the family computer. They opt for cheap, older cell phones -- no smartphones for this couple. The budget for entertainment is $100 per month. One night at the movies or an outing for frozen yogurt is as far as it goes, she said. Her salary of $55,000 to $60,000 may seem adequate, but Longshore hasn't seen a pay raise in 7 years, not even a cost of living increases, she said. Their life is modest but it keeps them content because the couple can keep teaching. Besides, she made up her mind in second grade. She was going to become a teacher. ""No matter where I turned, I kept coming back to the idea of teaching, inspired by the teachers that touched my life,"" she said. ""There just had to be more people like them in the profession -- and I was determined to be one of them."" Ms. Barnett was like a ""second mom"" when her parents divorced. Mr. Flurry ""was the first teacher who saw me,"" she said. Mr. Dale taught her to dream beyond poverty. Mrs. Cook helped her find her voice to speak up. ""Each of them became a part of who I am today,"" she said. ""Their influence inspired me towards my utmost. To have opportunity to invest and pour my life's work into budding politicians, businessmen and women, civil servants -- I could think of no greater calling."" There's more time with family . Working ""crazy hours"" as an operations manager at a startup company, Ryan Thompson spent little time with his family and little time relaxing. ""I had no social life and I was frustrated with that. I felt like I was chasing money to be happy,"" said the 31-year-old from Somis, California. When he was laid off from the startup, Thompson saw it as an opportunity to change careers. He now teaches entrepreneurship at Thousand Oaks High School and appreciates each day. ""I never feel like I am punching in and punching out."" But before he was molding young minds, he had a reality check -- his future, shrunken paycheck. In the beginning, it took awhile to ""be OK with not making a lot of money,"" he said. Teacher turned down high-paying job to stay . While he was studying to become a teacher, he started a small window-cleaning and pressure-washing business to get by. It was only meant to be temporary, but it's now a second source of income. ""I do that year-round still to this day, so that supplements the low pay that teachers get,"" he said. He also took night classes to push himself higher on the pay scale -- teachers are paid partially based on their work experience and education. Last year he was making just shy of $45,000 and after eight graduate classes, he will be making $53,000, he said. ""I do sometimes wonder what if I stayed in the corporate world and what that would look like,"" he said. ""But now that I have three kids, I would have to say that my job is an awesome family job."" There aren't many dads who get the summer free and can come home at 2:15 p.m., so his children love that, he said. Helping kids who struggle like she did . Mary Lynch wanted to add a voice ""from an often overlooked demographic of teachers:"" those who are not in unions. She teaches art at a private school for students who have been kicked out of the public school system in Fairfax County, Virginia. ""I don't think that people understand that many nonunion teachers are on even lower pay scales than union teachers,"" she wrote. ""And we usually don't have the protection that unions provide, nor do we have pension programs."" The salary of for a public school teacher in a union with the same years of experience would be making almost $70,000 a year, according to Fairfax County Public Schools' salary scale. Lynch, who did not share her salary, works at a nonprofit private school. She's now entering her 19th year of teaching and is living paycheck to paycheck. ""My plans for my retirement future are structured around winning the lottery or, if that fails, working until I die,"" she said. Lynch's students provide professional challenges, as many of the middle- and high-schoolers cannot read or perform basic math. ""We have to work ridiculously hard to make up ground lost over years and years of unsuccessful education,"" she said. There's also a threat of ""physical violence"" from her students, she said, which makes the job ""emotionally draining."" Yet, the veteran teacher remains fiercely loyal to these struggling kids. ""I was drawn to this population when I recognized the ease with which difficult children fall through the educational cracks, and the social impact that a lack of educating this population has on society,"" she said. Lynch herself struggled through high school and was diagnosed with a severe learning disability in her 30s. ""I saw my situation as an opportunity to help other students with similar learning issues find a way to be successful,"" she said. ""I teach because I love what I do, and despite losing kids to the judicial system and street violence, there is nothing like seeing them succeed."" Giving back to kids who need it . Wearing a red shirt that reads ""love"" with a figure in a wheelchair representing the ""o"", Allie Griffin has been on the picket lines all week. The special education teacher joined the Chicago strike because there are basic needs at her school that just aren't being met. She works in a program for children with autism at a South Side elementary school. Her students need special supplies, so she's spent $4,000 to $5,000 of her own money since she began teaching three years ago, she said. She makes $47,000 a year, which was her starting salary. ""They need adaptive scissors because they can't use regular scissors,"" she said. ""Most of my students can't write yet; they're working on fine motor skills so they can hold a pencil,"" so she buys Velcro. Magnets and other objects also help the children with sorting activities. ""I teach special education in Chicago because regardless of the working conditions, I am going to find the resources somewhere to make our classroom function,"" she wrote on CNN iReport. Even though she misses being in the classroom, she went on strike to speak up for her students, she said. ""Everybody is here advocating for the students,"" she said. ""I come from a staff of teachers that love what we do; we love the kids."" iReport: I teach to see them smile . Griffin grew up in the wealthy Chicago suburb of Naperville, where a good education was a given, she said. As a teacher, she wants to give her students the same ""premier"" education, regardless of where they're from. For her, it's about giving back. ""I teach special education in Chicago because I leave my job every day knowing that I gave a lot, but was given more,"" she said. Finding self-reliance and their own truth . ""The frustrations I face most as an educator are not the low pay, long hours or poor benefits,"" says dance educator Daniel Levi-Sanchez. ""It's the ignorance of politicians that are out of touch with what is happening on the ground that draft educational policies that have nothing to do with preparing our future leaders with the tools to become self-reliant and creative thinking adults."" He uses a creative art, like dance, to help teach the children self-expression and individuality. He hopes to shape them into adults who are confident and passionate in whatever endeavors they pursue. ""Most of my teaching derives from the curiosity of my students and what I do as an educator is invest myself in their journey of finding the truth,"" he said. Because I still believe there's a future . The Piscataway, New Jersey, resident is still on a journey of his own, as he is striving to become a full-time educator. He left teaching to finish his master's degree program in dance education; he's in his third year. For now he, his wife and two girls are living in graduate housing, he said. ""Each semester I have to answer the very real question: Can I afford it anymore?"" he said. Yet, he forges ahead because he believes he can help students feel like they are a valued part of society. ""Children and adolescents are smarter than we give them credit for. If the administration and politicians really took the time to listen to these future leaders, we wouldn't be in the mess that we are in today with our educational system.""","Salary cuts, supply shortages and administration issues are common frustrations .

"Terrorists will stop at nothing to keep Afghan girls from receiving an education. ""People are crazy,"" said Razia Jan, founder of a girls' school outside Kabul. ""The day we opened the school, (on) the other side of town, they threw hand grenades in a girls' school, and 100 girls were killed. ""Every day, you hear that somebody's thrown acid at a girl's face ... or they poison their water."" There were at least 185 documented attacks on schools and hospitals in Afghanistan last year, according to the United Nations. The majority were attributed to armed groups opposed to girls' education. ""It is heartbreaking to see the way these terrorists treat ... women,"" said Jan, 68. ""In their eyes, a women is an object that they can control. They are scared that when these girls get an education, they will become aware of their rights as women and as a human being."" Despite the threat of violence, Jan continues to open the doors of her Zabuli Education Center, a two-story, 14-room building where 354 area girls are receiving a free education. ""Most of the (local) men and women are illiterate,"" Jan said. ""Most of our students are the first generation of girls to get educated."" Seven small villages make up Deh'Subz, where the school is located. Though Deh'Subz is not Taliban-controlled, Jan has still found it difficult to change the deep-rooted stigma against women's education. On the evening before the school opened in 2008, four men paid her a visit. ""They said, 'This is your last chance ... to change this school into a boys' school, because the backbone of Afghanistan is our boys,' "" Jan recalled. ""I just turned around and I told them, 'Excuse me. The women are the eyesight of Afghanistan, and unfortunately you all are blind. And I really want to give you some sight.' "" Jan has not seen the men since. ""You can't be afraid of people,"" she said. ""You have to be able to say 'no.' Maybe because I'm old, the men are kind of scared of me, and they don't argue with me."" The Zabuli Education Center teaches kindergarten through eighth grade. Without her school, Jan says, many of the students would not be able to receive an education. ""When we opened the school in 2008 and I had these students coming to register, 90% of them could not write their name. And they were 12- and 14-year-old girls,"" Jan said. ""Now, they all can read and write."" Jan's school teaches math, science, religion and three languages: English, Farsi and Pashto. It recently added a computer lab with Internet access. ""They can touch the world just sitting in this house,"" Jan said. ""The knowledge is something that nobody can steal from them."" To shield the students from attacks, Jan has built a new stone wall to surround the school. She also employs staff and guards who serve as human guinea pigs of sorts. ""The principal and the guard, they test the water every day,"" Jan said. ""They will drink from the well. If it's OK, they'll wait. ... Then they'll fill (the) coolers and bring it to the classroom."" Jan says she is so scared of poisoning that school staff members accompany children to the bathroom and make sure the children don't drink water from the faucet. Additionally, the day guard arrives early each morning to check for any gas or poison that might be leaked inside the classrooms. The guard opens doors and windows and checks the air quality before any children are allowed to enter. ""People are so much against girls getting educated,"" Jan said. ""So we have to do these precautions."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . Born in Afghanistan in the 1940s, Jan traveled to the United States in 1970 to attend college. Much of her family was killed or fled Afghanistan during the Russian invasion. She stayed in the U.S., raised a son and opened a small tailoring business. She became an American citizen in 1990. Jan was always involved in various philanthropic efforts and community organizations in Duxbury, Massachusetts. She worked for many years to forge connections between Afghans and Americans. Then the events of September 11 shook her to the core. ""I was really affected personally by what happened to the innocent in the U.S.,"" she said. ""It's something that you cannot imagine for a human being to do to other human beings."" Almost overnight, Jan turned her small store into a workshop and launched an exhaustive campaign to help victims, first responders, U.S. soldiers and Afghan children. Jan and community volunteers sent 400 homemade blankets to rescue workers at ground zero and assembled and shipped nearly 200 care packages for U.S. troops in Afghanistan. When she heard that U.S. soldiers needed shoes to distribute to Afghan children, Jan and her volunteers sent them more than 30,000 boxes of shoes. Still, in the back of her mind was a bigger dream. On a visit to her homeland in 2002, she noticed that women and girls were struggling from years of Taliban control. ""I saw that the girls had been the most oppressed,"" she said. ""The Taliban regime was very brutal, brutal in the way that the woman had no place in their book. The woman had no right. No say in anything."" Jan said that while her life in America was fulfilling and rich, her dream was ""to do something for Afghanistan and to educate the girls."" So in 2004, she began searching for land on which to build a school. In 2005, she began fundraising through her Massachusetts-based nonprofit, Razia's Ray of Hope. Then, on a visit to Afghanistan, Jan was able to negotiate with the Ministry of Education to secure the land where the Zabuli Education Center now stands. ""After five years now, (the men) are shoulder to shoulder with me, which is such a great thing,"" Jan said. ""It's unbelievable how much they are proud of the girls."" The school is entirely free. Jan says it costs $300 to teach each girl for an entire year. Those fees are covered by donations to her nonprofit. Read about the CNN Heroes of 2012 . Although she isn't there every day of the week, Jan spends as much time at the school as possible. She meets with her students' fathers and grandfathers two or three times a year to address any issues and make sure she still has their buy-in. She also deals with community elders and locals to ensure that the school has local support. Jan, who takes no money for her work with the school, believes the education her students receive will benefit not only future generations of Afghan women but the country as a whole. ""My school is very small. It's nothing big. But for this to start here, I think it's like a fire. And I think it will grow,"" she said. ""I hope that one day these girls ... will come back and teach, because I'm not going to be there all my life. I want to make this school something that will last 100 years from now.""

"This isn't the first time Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has faced allegations that he's racist. Audio recordings from a conversation full of racist comments attributed to Sterling surfaced over the weekend, bringing national attention to him and his team. But the billionaire real estate mogul has found himself in hot water in the past, denying in court accusations of discrimination tied to the NBA team and to property he owns. A top team executive accused Sterling of running the Clippers with a ""plantation"" mentality. Federal prosecutors accused his rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans. And a group of tenants accused him of ""numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices."" ""Actions speak louder than words, and Mr. Sterling's actions have been consistent,"" former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday. Abdul-Jabbar, who coached the Clippers for about three months in 2000, said Sterling has ""a bad reputation."" ""I'm not surprised by this very much,"" he said, ""and that's really the most unfortunate part of this."" Sterling, who has not publicly commented about the recordings, has owned the team for more than three decades. Clippers President Andy Roeser said Sunday that Sterling is upset and ""emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect, his views, beliefs or feelings."" Here's a look at what court documents reveal about several claims made against Sterling in the past: . 2009: Clippers' former general manager files a wrongful termination lawsuit . Elgin Baylor, who was executive vice president and general manager of the Clippers from 1986 to 2008, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination against Sterling in 2009, saying that the team's owner underpaid him and treated him ""as a token because of his race."" Baylor, who is African-American and an 11-time NBA All-Star, said Sterling wouldn't let him negotiate players' salaries and had a vision of a ""Southern Plantation type structure"" for the team. Sterling, according to Baylor's complaint, told Baylor repeatedly that he ""wanted the CLIPPERS team to be composed of 'Poor Black boys from the South' and a White head coach."" The lawsuit also accuses Sterling of ageism and alleges that Sterling harassed him by making demeaning comments about his age. Sterling denied those accusations and said the team acted within its rights and ""for good cause and not for any improper reason."" Before the case went to trial, Baylor dropped the racial discrimination claim but maintained accusations of age discrimination. A jury sided with Sterling in 2011. At the time, the jury's foreman said jurors believed Baylor was fired because the ""team hadn't been performing,"" according to the Los Angeles Times. 2006: Justice Department accuses Sterling of housing discrimination . A Justice Department lawsuit filed in 2006 accused Sterling's rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans, refusing to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles County and turning away families with children from its properties. That case was settled in 2009, with Sterling agreeing to pay nearly $3 million but continuing to deny the accusations. ""The magnitude of this settlement should send a message to all landlords that we will vigorously pursue violations of the Fair Housing Act,"" Thomas E. Perez, then head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said at the time. Robert Platt, a lawyer for the Sterling Family Trust, said at the time that the settlement includes no admission of liability and the government ""could not identify a single individual who was wrongfully denied the right to rent an apartment from the trust."" He said the company had a ""zero-tolerance"" policy regarding discrimination. ""My clients vehemently and unequivocally deny that anyone was discriminated against,"" Platt said in a written statement on the settlement. ""Nevertheless, the insurance companies for the trust decided to settle the case because the cost of continued litigation far exceeded the cost of settlement."" 2003: Tenants, nonprofit allege housing discrimination . The nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties filed a federal lawsuit in 2003 against Sterling, accusing him of ""numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices,"" according to court documents. Court documents allege that Sterling told building staff that he did not like Hispanic or African-American tenants and that he preferred Korean-American tenants and made ""disparaging comments"" about African-American and Hispanic tenants. They also allege that Sterling's company refused to accept rent from African-American and Latino tenants -- then later attempted ""to use the tenants' supposed failure to pay rent as a basis for eviction."" And they claim that African-American and Latino tenants were asked to sign in as visitors at apartment buildings where they had long lived. Sterling, according to court documents, ""vehemently denied"" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of ""being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas."" The case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached. Details of the deal were not disclosed. According to court documents, a judge ordered Sterling to pay nearly $5 million in attorney's fees to the plaintiffs.","Abdul-Jabbar: ""Actions speak louder than words, and Mr. Sterling's actions have been consistent""

"Bolivian President Evo Morales apologized for the humiliation suffered by indigenous peoples at the hands of the police over the weekend,  and said his government did not mandate the attacks, state media reported late Wednesday. ""We ask for forgiveness -- forgive me,"" Morales said, according to Bolivia's state news agency.   ""It was not an instruction by the president. No one in the government would have thought such an attack could happen to our indigenous brothers."" On Sunday, 500 police tear-gassed and rousted about half of 1,500 indigenous protesters making a 300-mile march to the capital, La Paz, to protest a road project through a national park on their ancestral homeland. The marchers say four people were killed, scores of protesters were injured and several others were missing.  On Monday, Bolivian officials denied any deaths or injuries but promised to launch a full-scale investigation into the raid, which they said was undertaken to save lives and avoid confrontations. Bolivian indigenous leaders have vowed to keep fighting the project even though Morales said Monday he would suspend construction pending a national dialogue. Indigenous leaders, who maintain the marchers were unarmed, expressed their skepticism Tuesday over Morales' statement. ""We don't believe what he says anymore,"" said Rosario Barradas, a leader of the Conference of Indigenous People. ""We are reorganizing to continue this,"" Barradas told CNN. ""We are not going to stop until this is solved. Monday night's concession to suspend construction ""will lower pressure but won't solve the problem,"" said Jaime Aparicio, the Bolivian ambassador to the United States from 2002 to 2006. ""This is not an easy problem to solve."" At the heart of the dispute lies the construction of a highway through the Isiboro-Secure Indigenous Territory and National Park, a rainforest preserve commonly known by its Spanish acronym of TIPNIS. The road, being constructed mostly by a Brazilian company, aims to give Brazil access to Pacific Ocean ports by connecting to highways in Chile and Peru. Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development is financing $330 million of the road's estimated $415 million cost, the Bolivian government has said. ""There's a lot of money involved,"" said journalist Martin Arostegui, who has lived in Bolivia for the past five years. That money has an even bigger impact on Bolivia, one of the poorest and least developed nations in Latin America. About one of every three Bolivians lives below the poverty level. ""The rights of indigenous people are recognized on paper, but, unfortunately, when it comes to these big economic projects that come from the top down, these rights get swept by the wayside,"" said Andrew Miller, a spokesman for the Amazon Watch advocacy group. There also are social concerns for a large indigenous population that is used to living in relative isolation, said Miller, the Amazon Watch spokesman. The indigenous movement has been on the upswing since 1990, when a large march to La Paz helped to solidify their power. That burgeoning power seemed to come to fruition in December 2005, when Morales was elected the nation's first indigenous president. Running on a platform of empowering the nation's indigenous majority, Morales won by the widest margin of any candidate since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982. He easily won re-election in December 2009, when his party also gained control of the nation's legislature. Now many of those indigenous supporters feel Morales has deserted them. ""Evo Morales' government does not respect human rights,"" said indigenous leader Barradas. ""Of course, we are betrayed because the indigenous people supported him to establish a plurinational government."" The Bolivian government extolled the supposed benefits area residents would receive from the road, saying it would help the indigenous receive better health care and education. Indigenous from at least 16 communities expressed their support for it. But many indigenous remained steadfastly opposed and were marching to La Paz when police swooped in Sunday afternoon near the town of Yucumo and carted many of them off in buses. Authorities aimed to disperse the protesters by putting them on planes and flying them home. The marchers were resting, cooking dinner, washing clothes and bathing when police arrived, Barradas said. ""We were surprised, ambushed, assaulted and abducted by the police,"" she said Monday afternoon, about 24 hours after the raid. Police efforts were thwarted, though, when local indigenous people shut down two airports and freed many of those who had been apprehended by police. All the protesters apparently had gained their freedom by Tuesday. The Bolivian government initially said the police intervention had been done to protect the marchers. ""The only reason for the action that was taken was to avoid a confrontation between civilians,"" Interior Minister Sacha Llorenti said Monday morning. Problems started to build for Morales, though, a short while later when Defense Minister Cecilia Chacon resigned in protest over the police intervention. By Monday afternoon, the government had ordered an investigation into whether ""excessive force"" had been used. Late Monday night, Morales said he would suspend construction during this ""national debate,"" saying the public would decide the road's fate.","""Forgive me,"" Evo Morales says after police violence .

"On Sunday's CNN ""State of the Union"" show, anchor Candy Crowley asked Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D- California), the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and her counterpart in the House, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Michigan), a simple question: ""Are we safer now than we were a year ago, two years ago, in general?"" Feinstein's' answer was unambiguous, ""I don't think so. I think terror is up worldwide. Statistics indicate that. The fatalities are way up. ... There are more groups than ever, and there is huge malevolence out there."" Crowley seemed surprised by this response: ""I have to say, that is not the answer I expected. I expected to hear, oh, we're safer."" Rogers backed up Feinstein's gloomy assessment, saying, ""Oh, I absolutely agree that we're not safer today."" Both Feinstein and Rogers are able public servants who, as the heads of the two U.S. intelligence oversight committees, are paid to worry about the collective safety of Americans, and they are two of the most prominent defenders of the NSA's controversial surveillance programs, which they defend as necessary for American security. But is there any real reason to think that Americans are no safer than was the case a couple of years back? Not according to a study by the New America Foundation of every militant indicted in the United States who is affiliated with al Qaeda or with a like-minded group or is motivated by al Qaeda's ideology. In fact, the total number of such indicted extremists has declined substantially from 33 in 2010 to nine in 2013.  And the number of individuals indicted for plotting attacks within the United States, as opposed to being indicted for traveling to join a terrorist group overseas or for sending money to a foreign terrorist group, also declined from 12 in 2011 to only three in 2013. Of course, a declining number of indictments doesn't mean that the militant threat has disappeared. One of the militants indicted in 2013 was Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is one of the brothers alleged to be responsible for the Boston Marathon bombings in April. But a sharply declining number of indictments does suggest that fewer and fewer militants are targeting the United States. Recent attack plots in the United States also do not show signs of direction from foreign terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda, but instead are conducted by individuals who are influenced by the ideology of violent jihad, usually because of what they read or watch on the Internet. None of the 21 homegrown extremists known to have been involved in plots against the United States between 2011 and 2013 received training abroad from a terrorist organization -- the kind of training that can turn an angry, young man into a deadly, well-trained, angry, young man. Of these extremists, only Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the alleged Boston bombers, is known to have had any contact with militants overseas, but it is unclear to what extent, if any, these contacts played in the Boston Marathon bombings. In short, the data on al-Qaeda-linked or -influenced militants indicted in the United States suggests that the threat of terrorism has actually markedly declined over the past couple of years. Where Feinstein and Rogers were on much firmer ground in their interview with Crowley was when they pointed to the resurgence of a number of al Qaeda groups in the Middle East. Al Qaeda's affiliates in Syria control much of the north of the country and are the most effective forces fighting the regime of Bashar al-Assad. In neighboring Iraq, al Qaeda has enjoyed a renaissance of late, which partly accounts for the fact that the violence in Iraq today is as bad as it was in 2008. The Syrian war is certainly a magnet for militants from across the Muslim world, including hundreds from Europe, and European governments are rightly concerned that returning veterans of the Syrian conflict could foment terrorism in Europe. But, at least for the moment, these al Qaeda groups in Syria and Iraq are completely focused on overthrowing the Assad regime or attacking what they regard as the Shia-dominated government of Iraq. And, at least so far, these groups have shown no ability to attack in Europe, let alone in the United States.","Heads of intelligence committees tell CNN U.S. is no safer than in 2011 .

"(CNN) -- The woman who accused football star Ben Roethlisberger of raping her in March in a bar in Milledgeville, Georgia, described the alleged incident to police as the culmination of a night of bar-hopping. A prosecutor decided this week that he would not pursue criminal charges against Roethlisberger, saying he could not prove that a crime had been committed. The woman, a 20-year-old college student who has not been identified publicly, said she and her friends first saw the Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterback on the night of March 4 at Velvet Elvis, a supper club in Milledgeville, which is 83 miles south of Atlanta, Georgia. After posing with him for pictures, ""we left him alone"" and went to The Brick, a pizza and pasta place in the same town, she said. Roethlisberger and his entourage were there, too, she said, adding, ""We continued to have casual conversation. He even made crude, sexual remarks."" Afterward, both groups made their way to Capital City, she said. The nightclub describes itself as having ""great music, awesome drinks, hot bartenders."" ""Ben asked us to go to his 'VIP' area (back of Capital). We all went with him. He said there were shots for us, numerous shots were on the bar, and he told us to take them. His bodyguard came and took my arm and said come with me, he escorted me into a side door/hallway, and sat me on a stool. He left and Ben came back with his penis out of his pants. I told him it wasn't OK, no, we don't need to do this and I proceeded to get up and try to leave. I went to the first door I saw, which happened to be a bathroom. He followed me into the bathroom and shut the door behind him. I still said no, this is not OK, and he then had sex with me. He said it was OK. He then left without saying anything. ""I went out of the hallway/door to the side where I saw my friends. We left Capital and went to the first police car we saw."" The statement was among hundreds of pages of documents released Thursday by police. Public records show that Roethlisberger owns property on nearby Lake Oconee. Roethlisberger's attorney has said no rape occurred. In a statement, bar patron Ann Marie Lubatti told police that the back room of Capital City had been curtained off ""and Ben was back there with 15-20 girls. He was buying everyone shots and just talking and taking pictures with everyone. At this point he was noticeably intoxicated."" Lubatti said she watched the 6-foot, 5-inch, 241-pound athlete enter the back room where her friend was. ""I approached the other security guard and told him that she was in no shape to be back there with Ben Roethlisberger,"" she said. ""He couldn't look me in the eye, and told me he didn't know what was going on. My friend went to open the door, and it was locked. No one would let us into the room, and the security guards acted like they had no idea what was going on. ""Eventually, [the alleged victim] came out and wanted to go home. She said that she told him 'this isn't right,' but he still insisted on having intercourse."" Another patron, Nicole Biancofiore, said the alleged victim ""was dragged by a bodyguard to the back room in Capital. She was extremely intoxicated and not aware of what was happening."" Biancofiore said she spoke with club manager Rocky Duncan, who told her, ""Ben was not going to do anything to ruin his reputation for the Steelers."" In his statement, Duncan told police that he had seen Roethlisberger ""and his group of friends go in and out of my private bathroom located outside my office in the rear room of Capital City."" He said he noticed ""a young lady sitting on a stool outside the bathroom talking to Ben."" ""The ladies asked about going back there to see their friend, so I told them they could walk over to the open area and see her. After talking to the friend, I assured her her friend would be fine, because at last glance the 'victim' was still sitting outside the bathroom talking to Ben. That was the last I noticed of the situation."" At about 2 a.m., the alleged victim and several of her friends left the club and approached a police officer outside, according to Lubatti. He radioed Sgt. Jerry Blash, who approached on foot. According to Blash's case summary, ""he asked [the alleged victim] if Roethlisberger had raped her and she stated, 'No, I did not know what was going on,' because she was intoxicated so much."" The summary said, ""Blash indicated that he asked the victim, 'Did he rape you?', and the victim stated 'no.' Blash asked the victim if they had sex, and she responded by saying, 'Well, I'm not sure.' "" Blash went to Capital City, where he found Roethlisberger and his entourage and told them about the allegation. ""Roethlisberger told Blash that he remembered her and he had told her that she was too drunk to be back there,"" the summary said. ""Roethlisberger did not allege any sexual intercourse with the female. Roethlisberger remembered her falling and hitting her head. The female's friends got mad because they could not come to the back."" In the summary, Blash acknowledged having made off-color remarks about the alleged victim at the club. ""When asked about a comment similar to 'this f------ b---- is drunk' or 'this b---- is drunk off her ass accusing Ben of assaulting her,"" Blash said that he did say something like that to the other Milledgeville police officers and indicated that Roethlisberger's bodyguards may have overheard the comment,"" the report said. It added, ""Blash indicted (sic) that he was mad because the victim was not being 'straight up' with him and that pissed him off."" Blash resigned Wednesday, Milledgeville Police Chief Woodrow Blue told CNN on Friday. He would not discuss reasons for the resignation. According to Officer Jason Lopez, the woman told him that the alleged rape occurred as she was seated on the toilet in the bathroom, that the athlete did not use a condom and she did not know whether he ejaculated. The alleged victim was taken to Oconee Regional Medical Center, where a sexual assault kit was completed. Officials reported they were not able to obtain enough genetic material to pursue an identification.","Woman says Roethlisberger raped her in club bathroom after she tried to resist him .

"It's been called a ""cure for rejection-letter fatigue."" Amazon on Thursday released new details about the success of its program for authors who want to self-publish on its Kindle e-reader devices. The company, which unveiled a suite of new e-readers and tablets at a press conference in Southern California on Thursday, says 27 of the top 100 Kindle books were created using a system called Kindle Direct Publishing. That system allows authors to bypass traditional publishers and instead deal directly with Amazon, which claims to be able to publish their books digitally ""in hours."" The authors receive 70% of the royalties from the sale of these books. And some of them are doing quite well. ""Most of my months are six-figure months,"" said Hugh Howey, a 37-year-old Florida author whose ""Wool"" series of digital books was highlighted by Amazon. ""It's more than I ever hoped to make in a year."" The company says some authors, including Theresa Ragen, who appeared in a promotional video during the Amazon event, have sold hundreds of thousands of books. During the event Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos displayed a quote from Kathryn Stockett, author of best-selling novel ""The Help,"" in which she lamented being rejected dozens of times before a publisher accepted her. ""What if I had given up at 15? Or 40? Or even 60?"" she was quoted as saying. ""The thing that occurs to me,"" Bezons said, according to a live blog, ""is how many authors did stop after 40 rejections? How many great manuscripts are sitting in a drawer somewhere?"" The fact that so many self-published books have been successful in Amazon's ecosystem highlights what other writers say is a trend toward success in digital self-publishing, which is offered also by companies like Apple and Barnes & Noble, in addition to Amazon. This comes despite evidence that many self-published e-book authors make very little money. A 1,007-person survey earlier this year found ""DIY authors"" make $10,000 a year on average, and half of them make less than $500 a year, according to a report in The Guardian. Still, the system does work for some. ""Fact is that authors no longer need a publisher,"" Bernard Starr wrote at The Huffington Post. ""And more and more writers are awakening to the realization that if you are not a high-profile author who can command large sales, a traditional publisher will do little for you beyond editing and printing your book."" For Howey, author of the ""Wool"" series, the direct-publishing platform has opened up a life he never imagined was possible -- one where he is paid to write full-time. Without the Amazon platform, the books might not have been published at all. Howey never promoted the first edition of ""Wool,"" a dystopian series about a group of underground people who get all of their information about the outside world through a single, digital screen. He didn't think it would sell. Then in October 2011, he said, his sales jumped from from dozens to thousands. ""I was taking screenshots and posting them on Facebook,"" he said of the moment when the books started appearing on Amazon's top-100 lists. (The compilation ""Wool Omnibus Edition"" is currently ranked No. 193 in the Kindle store, although it was listed in Amazon's press conference as being in the top 100, where it has appeared before). ""I was kind of bewildered by the whole thing."" Howey used to work as a bookseller and yacht captain. Now his story has been optioned by the director Ridley Scott, according to news reports. New York publishers have approached him about book deals, he said, but he wants to continue to self-publish so he maintains rights to his work. ""The stigma is gone,"" he said of self-publishing in digital formats. ""Publishers will pick up a self-published work if it does well. Readers are really just interested in good stories.""","Amazon: 27 of 100 top Kindle books are self-published .

"The police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, has problems. He's been under intense scrutiny ever since a white officer in his department fatally shot African-American teenager Michael Brown. Now, government officials familiar with ongoing discussions are saying he is expected to step down as part of an effort by city officials to reform the Police Department. Chief Thomas Jackson and Ferguson's mayor have denied the reports. There's no denying, however, that Jackson is in hot water. Here's a look at five ways the police chief or his department have sparked outrage in the community: . 1. Body in the street . After Brown was gunned down, his body lay in the street for four hours in a blazing Missouri sun. Police would later say that officials couldn't reach the area where the body lay because a crowd had gathered, making it too dangerous. State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal said the community was ""outraged by looking at this body all day long."" In an apology a month later, Jackson would apologize to Brown's family. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said during his video statement. Investigators were doing ""important work"" trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours, Jackson said, but ""it was just too long, and I'm truly sorry for that."" 2. Video of theft . As demonstrators clamored for more information about how Brown came to lie dead on a Ferguson street, the Police Department clamped down, releasing little information. Yet, six days after the shooting -- on the same day police released Officer Darren Wilson's name to the public -- police decided to release video of a robbery in which Brown was involved before he died. To make matters more confusing, Jackson told reporters that Wilson didn't stop Brown because of the robbery, but because he was walking in the street. This caused many to say ""huh?"" The decision to release that store surveillance video, while the Police Department was keeping so many other details close to the vest, created consternation even among his colleagues. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson stated the robbery and shooting of Brown ""are separate issues."" ""I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go,"" he told CNN. ""Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family."" Jackson responded that news outlets had requested the video and Wilson's identification. He also said they needed to be released at the same time, but he didn't elaborate as to why. Brown family attorney Benjamin Crump said the move was ""a diversion, and it's an attempt to smear Michael's character."" 3. Heavy-handed response to protests . When protesters hit the streets -- and violent elements among them looted and vandalized businesses -- it wasn't long before police brought out the heavy weaponry. Soon, images out of Ferguson included police in riot gear with shields and batons, automatic weapons, police dogs, armored vehicles and police firing rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds. It's important to note that St. Louis County Police Department was in charge of tactical operations within hours of Brown's death, but it all unfolded in Ferguson, and that mattered to many onlookers. Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, well-versed in unrest after leading recovery efforts for Hurricane Katrina, questioned the logic of letting SWAT teams handle a civil disturbance. ""The tactics they are using, I don't know where they learned them from,"" he said. ""It appears they may be making them up on the way, but this is escalating the situation."" 4. Keep walking . A common refrain from police to protesters during the demonstrations was, ""Keep moving."" Police were arresting or threatening to arrest anyone who stood still along the sidewalks, whether they were just stopping to rest or a reporter taking notes. A federal judge ruled that they violated the Constitution when police told protesters they had to keep walking and that they couldn't stand still. In some cases, officers told protesters they couldn't stand for more than five seconds. In others, the protesters were told they were walking too slowly. Jackson would have to include a statement in his video apology on how officers did not protect the people's freedom to assemble. ""The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry,"" the police chief said. 5. Lack of police diversity . Some of the complaints against Jackson stretch back further than Brown's shooting. ""People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the Ferguson police force. These anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters after visiting the area. The Justice Department is investigating the Police Department. It will look at the department's use of force, analyze stops, searches and arrests, and examine the treatment of people at Ferguson's city jail. Many African-Americans in Ferguson say that they often found themselves subject to racial profiling, such as being pulled over for no obvious reason besides, they presumed, ""DWB,"" or driving while black. The city is a predominately black community with a mostly white police force. At the time of Brown's shooting, only three of the city's 53 officers were African-American.","Chief Thomas Jackson is expected to step down, according to officials .

"All BlackBerry did Wednesday was change its corporate name, introduce two new smartphones and launch a bold new mobile operating system, BlackBerry 10, that may be the struggling company's last stab at relevance. Now it's up to consumers to render a verdict on whether BlackBerry's new offerings -- the all-touchscreen Z10 phone and the Q10, which still has a keyboard -- are worth buying over iPhones or Android devices. BlackBerry (they're now no longer known as Research in Motion) still has some work to do, and early reviews of BlackBerry 10 have been mixed. But there are some promising signs out there. Here are five reasons BlackBerry 10 may win over fans, new and old. New productivity features . Large companies and government agencies have historically been BlackBerry's core clients. But in recent years more people have been bringing their own devices into the workplace, choosing to stick with fun, app-laden phones over devices that just offer security and IT-department approval. For BlackBerry 10, the company smartly focused on features that maximize productivity and speed. A new feature called Balance splits a BlackBerry phone into two separate devices, one for work and one for personal use. (Balance is only for customers connected to BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10 at work.) The separate profiles cordon off sensitive work information so that IT departments can control the flow of data. Personal apps, e-mails and photos are on the Personal side, so you can jump from one profile to the other. It's a way to manage both sides of your life without sacrificing privacy or security, and without dragging around two separate devices as some BlackBerry users have been doing. CNNMoney: BlackBerry's Z10 and BB10 feel a generation late . Being productive requires switching between apps and tasks quickly and seamlessly. At the BlackBerry 10 launch event Wednesday morning, executives demonstrated something called BlackBerry Hub, which collects all a user's notifications in one spot. It can be accessed from anywhere on the phone with a swipe, and shows social media, calendar, BBM, e-mail and other updates (you can pick what shows up here to minimize noise). You can have up to eight apps going at once, and the feature lets users quickly switch back and forth between messaging platforms without having to open or close apps or revisit the home screen. Another popular tool, BlackBerry Messenger (BBM to its friends), got a new upgrade. The messaging app already allowed for free voice calls over Wi-Fi, but in BB10 it's adding a FaceTime-like video-chatting feature. Perhaps its coolest new trick is the ability to share your phone's screen with the person on the other end of the call (if they're also on a BlackBerry 10 device), so you can review work documents or enjoy photos together without having to e-mail or upload the files. Big-name apps . A smartphone is only as good as its app-store selection. BlackBerry has been working hard, and spending money, to fill up its app store with over 70,000 apps for the launch of BlackBerry 10. However, many of those apps are old BlackBerry or Android apps that have been ported over to the new system, not designed specifically for its features. It's going to require quality, not just quantity, for people to leave behind the Apple App Store and Google Play store. BlackBerry has managed to secure an impressive number of big-name apps out the gate. Skype, Kindle, WhatsApp, SAP and ""Angry Birds"" have committed to developing for BlackBerry 10, which means they're on the way soon, if not in the online store yet. Popular apps such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn already have BlackBerry 10 apps. But there are still many missing pieces, such as apps for Instagram, Hulu and Google products. BlackBerry is clearly aware of the importance of robust app offerings. But app developers might still need to be convinced that the new platform will catch on and not be a waste of their time. Typing is easy to learn . BlackBerry fans are good at resisting change. Its diehard users have stuck with the company even though there were more advanced phones running superior software and featuring stores stocked with many more apps. The biggest sticking point was the beloved physical keyboard that could be navigated with a lone speedy thumb. Although BlackBerry announced two devices on Monday, it was the keyboard-free Z10 phone that dominated the event and is getting the larger marketing push. The company clearly wants to shift users to a touchscreen keyboard. To be successful, it will have to make learning how to type on the screen simple and enjoyable. ""Typing on a glass screen with one thumb, it's magic,"" said Heins. In BlackBerry's future, keyboards may be an afterthought . BlackBerry says the touchscreen keyboard learns how you type, adapting over time to be more accurate and to automatically correct common mistakes. There's support for multiple languages, and you can switch between languages mid-message. While you are typing, it will auto-suggest what words it thinks you may be composing, and you can swipe up to toss one directly into your message. Positive buzz . A strange thing has happened in the past couple of months. Consumers, investors and the press have been cautiously optimistic about the Canadian company's plans for a comeback. BlackBerry has gone from being mocked to being seen as an underdog people are rooting for. Rebranding is one part of that process, and on Monday CEO Thorsten Heins announced that the company is renaming itself BlackBerry, dropping the awkward Research In Motion (RIM) moniker. BlackBerry hasn't had a major product release in 18 months, which is an eternity in the smartphone world and long enough for memories of the devices to slip people's minds. Hardcore fans may be ready to upgrade to BlackBerry 10, but to take on Apple and Google, BlackBerry needs to shed its stigma of being out of date. When you want cool points, you hire a celebrity (see: Windows Phone 8 and Jessica Alba, Polaroid and Lady Gaga). BlackBerry trotted out Alicia Keys near the end of Wednesday's event and gave her the honorary title of Global Creative Director. It was a nice touch, but tech-savvy shoppers aren't easily fooled by celebrity endorsements. They need to see real people using the devices, and they need to test them out for themselves. Global appeal . BlackBerry is rolling out its new Z10 phone gradually around the world, starting in the UK on Thursday. The phone launches in Canada on February 5, and in the United Arab Emirates on February 10. It won't be released in the U.S. until sometime in March. The focus on making the phone an international product is smart, since the company has a strong hold in places like the UAE, Indonesia, England and parts of South America. Wednesday's press announcement referenced satellite launch events for BlackBerry fans in London, Dubai and South Africa, among other far-flung places. BlackBerry hasn't just been wooing developers in the U.S., it's paying attention to the top mobile apps in other markets and getting those developers to create products for the BlackBerry 10 platform. To hold its own against Apple, Android and Microsoft, it will need them.","Maker of BlackBerry announces two new phones and a new mobile operating system .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be a celebration -- sun, fun and relaxation on a tropical island for recent graduates savoring the heady taste of approaching adulthood. But instead, the trip to Aruba by a group of Birmingham, Alabama, high school seniors ended in tragedy, as one of their members, 18-year-old Natalee Holloway, never returned home. Questions surrounding her fate are unanswered five years later. Now, Joran van der Sloot, the youth twice arrested and released in Holloway's disappearance -- seen by many as a privileged playboy who has displayed no remorse or concern over her whereabouts -- has been named a suspect in the bludgeoning death of a woman in Peru, allegations that hint at a chilling pattern. Van der Sloot was arrested Thursday in Chile following a manhunt. ""It's fair to say that he's a pretty easy guy to point a finger at, a pretty easy guy to say, 'I'm confident suspecting him,'"" said Joe Tacopina, who represents van der Sloot in the Aruba case. ""And he's earned some of that and some of it he hasn't earned. He's been through the wringer. He's been detained twice in Aruba. There's been absolutely no credible evidence in that case whatsoever ... he was never charged with a crime there. Don't forget that."" Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. She was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from Mountain Brook High School in suburban Birmingham. Holloway failed to show up for her flight home the following day, and her packed bags were found in her hotel room. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were arrested and released in 2005 in connection with the case, then arrested a second time in 2007 after Aruba's then-chief prosecutor Hans Mos said he had received new evidence in the case. Van der Sloot, then attending college in the Netherlands, was brought back to Aruba. But judges ruled the new evidence -- which included an Internet chat the same day Holloway disappeared with one of the three youths writing that she was dead -- was not enough to keep them in custody. In the years since Holloway vanished, van der Sloot has consistently denied any involvement in her disappearance, police said. ""He's just totally, totally dragged us all through hell,"" Holloway's anguished mother, Beth, has said. In 2008, a videotape surfaced on Dutch television. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he thought was a friend he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she ""started shaking"" and lost consciousness. He said he panicked when he could not resuscitate her and called a friend who had a boat. The two put Holloway in the boat, van der Sloot said, and he went home. The friend told him the next day that he had carried the body out and dumped it into the ocean. ""I don't lose a minute of sleep over it,"" van der Sloot said. He later claimed the account was a lie, saying he told the man what he wanted to hear. A court ruled there was not enough evidence to re-arrest him. Aruba chief prosecutor Peter Blanken said the story was ""unbelievable and not true."" But it's been van der Sloot's cavalier attitude toward the case that has fueled criticism, as well as conflicting statements he's made. He told Fox News in a 2008 interview he sold Holloway to human traffickers for $10,000, then in a taped interview denied it. At the time his name first surfaced in the Holloway investigation, suspicion swirled around his parents, particularly his father, an Aruban lawyer training to be a judge. Paul van der Sloot was briefly taken into custody in 2005 on suspicion of involvement in the Holloway case. Authorities said he told his son that police had no case without a body. He was released after three days of questioning. Holloway's parents, however, have said they met with Paul van der Sloot and continue to believe he had the answers to questions regarding their daughter. ""I remember the day I met with Paul at the prison,"" Dave Holloway has said. ""And the thing that stuck out in my mind was I asked him all the questions, why he hid from the news media. And the last question that I had was, was he involved, and he said no. He said, 'Dave, I can understand your position, but you've got to understand mine. Joran's my son and I'll do everything I can to protect him.' And I believe it."" Van der Sloot's mother, Anita, has said her son told her he was on the beach with Holloway but left her there because she wanted to stay. She has maintained her son's innocence. However, Tacopina said van der Sloot's relationship with his family has suffered in recent years. ""Joran in the last several years has gone in a very different direction, has not behaved in a way that is acceptable to anybody,"" he said, referring to van der Sloot's being paid for versions of events in the Holloway case. ""It border-lined on pathological, it really did, and quite frankly I think he hurt a lot of people."" Tacopina cautioned against jumping to conclusions, saying that many times a new lead was thought to be the key to the Holloway case but didn't pan out. In March, for instance, a Pennsylvania couple told authorities a picture they took last year while snorkeling off Aruba showed something that looked like a skeleton. Authorities called off a dive team's search after two days, saying they found nothing that resembled the image depicted in the photograph.","Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway disappeared in 2005 on Aruba .

"Guor Marial made his debut in the London Games on Sunday, a major accomplishment for the South Sudanese marathoner who ran as an independent in the Olympics. Marial, 28, pounded his way around the 26.2-mile course in 2:19:32. He finished 47th in the race dominated by fellow Africans Stephen  Kiprotich of Uganda, who won gold, and Kenyans Abel Kirui and Wilson Kiprotich, who won silver and bronze, respectively. But for Marial, completing the race was as good as winning. The marathoner was born in what is now South Sudan, which split  from Sudan last year after years of conflict between the two that left millions dead. Though he is a permanent resident of the United States,  where he fled 11 years ago to escape the bloody conflict, he is not an American citizen and thus cannot compete under its flag. He does not have a passport for South Sudan, either, and cannot compete for his homeland. And even if he had  one, the world's newest nation was not eligible for the Olympics this year because it does not have a Games committee. Since he qualified for the marathon but could not run for  both nations, the International Olympic Committee granted him permission to run as an independent. He donned a gray and black uniform with IOA --  Independent Olympic Athlete -- printed on it. ""Even if I am not going to carry or wear the flag, I will be the flag of my nation. South Sudan will be in my heart,"" he said before the race. Marial left home in 1993. His story of survival from the war has taken him across different countries, including Egypt, where he sought refuge before the United States granted him asylum in 2001. He attended high school in New Hampshire, where he gave competitive running a try after years of ""running away from conflict,"" he said. He later went to Iowa State University, where he had an athletic scholarship and was an All-American cross-country runner. The Olympian has not seen his parents since 1993, when he first fled what is now South Sudan. But on Sunday, they planned to catch a glimpse of their son on television after nearly two decades. ""I'm hoping they will at least see me run in the Olympics,"" Marial said last month. ""They live in a village with no electricity and no televisions. But they planned to walk to the nearest big town about 40 miles away so that they can watch me on television.""","""Even if I am not going to carry or wear the flag, I will be the flag of my nation,"" he says .

"Drones are everywhere. Consider that just in the past few days, a Federal Aviation Administration official revealed that in March a US Airways passenger jet nearly collided with a small-unmanned aircraft that looked similar to an F-4 Phantom jet and was flying above 2,000 feet over Florida. These details and the fact that the drone was described as ""camouflaged"" suggest that it was not a civilian drone. Then Sunday the Iranians announced that they had engineered a copy of a highly sophisticated U.S. surveillance drone that they had captured in 2011. Iran's state television showed footage of what they claimed was a replica of the American RQ-170 Sentinel drone. A photograph showed Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sitting next to the drone. The same day that the Iranians showed off their new drone, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, wrote an op-ed in The New York Times arguing against the appointment of David Barron as a federal judge. Barron was a White House lawyer who was involved in drafting the legal opinions used to justify the 2011 drone strike in Yemen that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen who had taken a leadership role in al Qaeda. Paul wrote, ""Killing an American citizen without a trial is an extraordinary concept and deserves serious debate. I can't imagine appointing someone to the federal bench, one level below the Supreme Court, without fully understanding that person's views concerning the extrajudicial killing of American citizens. ... I believe that all senators should have access to all of these opinions. Furthermore, the American people deserve to see redacted versions of these memos so that they can understand the Obama administration's legal justification for this extraordinary exercise of executive power."" Not so long ago, killing an American citizen on the other side of the world with an armed drone would have been in the realm of science fiction. Before 9/11, the United States had only a handful of experimental drones that had never been used to kill anyone. Today, there are at least 7,000 drones in the U.S. arsenal, more than 200 of which are armed drones  that have killed thousands of people. Nine facts about armed drones . This large American fleet of drones is a harbinger of an important trend. Armed drones will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as tanks were during World War II. We can expect to see them used not only by the United States, but also by other countries such as China and Russia that are jumping into the production of armed drones. But armed drones raise a number of moral and political issues that are unresolved. In Pakistan, the CIA drone campaign is deeply unpopular because Pakistanis ask themselves: What gives the United States the right to invade the sovereign airspace of our nation and sometimes kill our civilians, even in the service of the laudable goal of killing al Qaeda militants? For American readers, do a thought experiment in which armed Mexican drones were routinely killing members of drug cartels living in Texas, but they were also sometimes killing a number of ordinary Texans and you get a sense of how the average Pakistani thinks about this issue. In Yemen, the U.S. drone campaign has also become increasingly controversial because drones continue to kill Yemeni civilians -- as they did last month in a strike that targeted members of al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate. In that strike on April 19, at least nine militants were killed but so were three civilians. Even with these issues, drones present features that make them appealing to political and military leaders. Drones are not simply pieces of artillery that happen to fly. They have four characteristics that mean they are likely to reshape warfare at a tactical level. First, armed drones are different from any previous form of artillery because they can linger over and assess a target for many hours. That capability can quite dramatically lower the civilian casualty rates that have been typical of earlier eras of warfare. The smallest bomb dropped by the U.S. Air Force is typically 500 pounds. Such a bomb cannot, of course, distinguish between a civilian and a combatant. A drone can do so. And it can also shoot much smaller missiles, such as the 100-pound Hellfire missile. In that sense there is a case to be made that armed drones presage a more ethical form of warfare that kills fewer civilians. But that doesn't mean of course that drones and the people who operate them won't kill civilians in the future. The U.S. drone campaigns in Pakistan and Yemen have killed hundreds of civilians over the past half decade. Second, armed drones also make it possible to wage war against particular individuals. In a sense drones are flying assassins that target particular people. It is not an accident that the rise of drone warfare has coincided with America's unconventional war against al Qaeda and its allies. In conventional wars, armies wearing uniforms attack each other. But in the kind of drone warfare that the United States has conducted since 9/11 outside of conventional war zones in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen, drone strikes are not directed at someone because of his status as a uniformed member of another military force, but rather because of the individual's suspected connection to al Qaeda or an allied group. Bergen: Target an American with drones? Third, there is a lower threshold for the use of force when armed drones are an option. In many ways the use of armed drones is akin to the use of cyberwarfare. Both tactics greatly reduce or eliminate the number of deaths that would result from a conventional armed conflict.  And whoever launches a drone attack or a cyberattack pays no costs of the kind that would typically take place on a conventional battlefield. You can't shoot down a drone pilot or kill a computer technician launching some kind of cyberattack thousands of miles from the intended target. For this reason, drones and cyber capabilities can make conflict more likely as the barriers to engage in either drone warfare or cyberconflict are so low. (Until, of course, the opponent has the resources to retaliate in kind.) Fourth, drone warfare is taking place in an unprecedented information environment in which the U.S. government collects ever-vaster amounts of data. This data collection is so extensive that the National Security Agency, for instance, can record every phone call that is made in a particular country. It is this merger of ""big data"" and drone technology, which is also complemented by human intelligence about suspected terrorists provided by CIA assets on the ground in places such as Pakistan's tribal regions, that has made drone warfare against al Qaeda and its allies so effective. The CIA drone campaign in Pakistan has killed 58 militant leaders, according to a count by the New America Foundation. Thirty-five militant leaders have also been killed in Yemen. Meanwhile, at least 339 civilians have been killed as well as at least 2,200 foot soldiers in militant groups in Pakistan and Yemen. At least 230 other people were reported killed, though it was not clear from reliable news accounts if they were militants or civilians. Indeed, using the most conservative estimates from a database of drone attacks maintained by the New America Foundation, the Obama administration authorized the killing of more than 2,400 people in drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen from the time it first assumed office until the end of March 2014. (Using the least conservative estimates from that database, the total number of people killed was almost 4,000.) Put another way, using the most conservative estimates of the numbers of people killed in drone strikes by the Obama administration, they amount to three times the total number of the some 800 prisoners at the Guantanamo prison camp placed there by the Bush administration. As President Barack Obama reportedly told some of his aides, ""Turns out I'm really good at killing people. Didn't know that was going to be a strong suit of mine."" Osama bin Laden recognized the devastation that such drone strikes were inflicting on his organization, writing a lengthy memo about the issue that was later recovered in the compound in Pakistan where he was killed three years ago. In the October 2010 memo to a lieutenant, bin Laden advised his men to leave the Pakistani tribal regions where the drone strikes have been overwhelmingly concentrated. Bin Laden wrote, ""I am leaning toward getting most of our brothers out of the area"" and urged his followers to depart for the remote Afghan province of Kunar, explaining that ""due to its rough terrain and many mountains, rivers, trees, it can accommodate hundreds of the brothers without them being spotted by the enemy."" The civilian casualty rate from drone strikes has been dropping dramatically in recent years. According to New America Foundation data, the casualty rate in Pakistan for civilians and also for ""unknowns"" -- those who were not identified in news reports definitively as either militants or civilians -- was around 40% under President George W. Bush when the drone program was in its infancy. It has come down to about 7% under Obama. Bergen: Obama's high-stakes drone war in Yemen . In 2013 in Pakistan and Yemen, the numbers of civilians killed by drones in both countries combined was the lowest ever, in the single digits, according to the New America Foundation's data. This shift has been accomplished because of the combined effects of smaller munitions, improved drone flight technology, better intelligence on the ground, stricter White House guidelines regarding the use of drones, increased congressional oversight of the drone program and greater public scrutiny of the issue. It will be many years before other countries are able to build up the capacity that the United States has to carry out lethal drone strikes. As of 2013, the United States had drone bases in countries such as Afghanistan, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia. And it isn't as easy as some might think for other nations to arm unarmed drones. Such weapons systems require specific electrical engineering; the wings must be reinforced for the aircraft to sustain the force of launching a missile; the drone must be equipped with fire control systems, and built-in mounting brackets are needed to attach munitions to the vehicle. But even with these inherent limitations, the drone industry thrives, and more companies and nations continue to jump on board the drone bandwagon. And the U.S. aggressive and secretive drone campaign against al Qaeda and its affiliates is setting a powerful international precedent about the use of armed drones. It is these kinds of drone strikes that are controversial since the use of armed drones in a conventional war is not much different, legally, than a manned aircraft that drops bombs or fires missiles. There has been virtually no substantive public discussion about what an international legal framework governing such drone attacks should be among policymakers at the international level. It's long past due for that conversation to happen.","Peter Bergen says use of drones for military purposes is going to proliferate .

"(CNN)Cuba has freed all 53 political prisoners it had promised to release as part as an historic rapprochement with the United States, a U.S. official said Monday. The names of the prisoners were not given. The move comes as part of a deal announced December 17 to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba. Both nations have previously released political prisoners in a show of goodwill. American Alan Gross headed home on ""humanitarian"" grounds from Cuba last month. In a separate swap, a U.S. intelligence source held for 20 years was released in exchange for three jailed Cuban spies. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf provided details about the timing of the releases on Monday. A small number of the 53 prisoners identified by the U.S. side were released in the summer and fall, she said. A few additional prisoners were released before December 17. ""In the period since then ... the Cuban government has released all 53 persons whose names were shared by the U.S. government,"" Harf told reporters. She added: ""We know there are going to be human rights concerns we still have when it comes to Cuba, but we are very pleased that they followed through on this commitment."" Her point was echoed by Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, who commented on the releases last week. ""Prisoner releases will be no more than a smokescreen if they are not accompanied by expanded space for the free and peaceful expression of all opinions and other freedoms in Cuba,"" she said. According to Amnesty, which cited the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, 8,899 short-term detentions were reported last year, compared with 6,424 in 2013. ""The good will expressed by the Cuban authorities with this series of releases must absolutely translate into the implementation of a new human rights agenda. Respect for freedom of expression, assembly and association must be the next step if the Cuban authorities want to keep their credibility in the face of a world which is watching them,"" the Americas director said.","The move comes as part of a deal to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba .

"Robel Phillipos, a friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's, was convicted Tuesday on two counts of lying to federal agents investigating the 2013 bombing, according to the U.S. attorney's office. Prosecutors said Phillipos lied to investigators about being in Tsarnaev's college dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth after the bombing. He faces up to eight years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine. He will be sentenced January 29. After the verdict, U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said thousands of citizens assisted law enforcement in identifying and tracking down the suspects following one of the most significant events in Boston's modern history. ""A federal jury concluded that Robel Phillipos did just the opposite,"" she told reporters. ""He lied to agents when he could have helped. He concealed when he could have assisted. It is a crime to lie to law enforcement agents, and that is why Robel Phillipos was charged and why the jury found him guilty today. But this case also reminds us that our public safety network relies on every citizen in the commonwealth."" Defense attorneys Derege Demissie and Susan Church said their client will appeal the verdict. ""Basically ... the jury found that he was present in the room while others did what they did in this case,"" Church said. Defense lawyers argued that Phillipos, a Boston native, was a ""frightened and confused 19-year-old"" when authorities questioned him several times in the days following the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and wounded more than 260. ""I don't believe that Robel Phillipos has ever been more angry at a person than he was at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev when Robel found out that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did what he did in this case,"" Church said after the verdict. ""He was absolutely mortified. It was an unbelievable feeling of shock and betrayal that somebody that he knew could commit such atrocious and horrible acts."" Police believe Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- who was killed by police after the attacks -- set off the two bombs near the race's finish line. Phillipos attended high school with the younger Tsarnaev at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. According to court documents, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing. He was taking a semester off from the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth and was only on campus the night of April 18, 2013, for a seminar. His attorneys said that Phillipos was under tremendous pressure when he was interrogated and didn't have a lawyer at the time to help him. Phillipos' presence on campus that night is a case of ""sheer coincidence and bad luck,"" the defense lawyers said. Phillipos was living with his mother, an Ethiopian who immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and is now employed as a social worker. In July, a federal jury found another friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's guilty of obstructing the investigation into the attack. The jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. Tazhayakov will be sentenced November 19. A third friend of Tsarnaev's, Dias Kadyrbayev, pleaded guilty in August to conspiring to obstruct justice and obstructing justice with the intent to impede the bombing investigation. He will be sentenced November 18. Prosecutors said Phillipos repeatedly lied to investigators when he denied that he entered Tsarnaev's dormitory room and saw Kadyrbayev remove a backpack containing fireworks on the evening of April 18, 2013. At trial, prosecutors showed that Phillipos saw the images released by the FBI of the suspected bombers and recognized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.  On April 18, Phillipos went with Tazhayakov to Tsarnaev's dormitory room, where he and Tazhayakov watched as Kadyrbayev searched through Tsarnaev's belongings and found a backpack containing fireworks. When Kadyrbayev, Tazhayakov and Phillipos left Tsarnaev's room at 10:30 p.m., Kadyrbayev removed Tsarnaev's backpack containing fireworks, a jar of Vaseline, and Tsarnaev's laptop computer, prosecutors said. Later that night while Tazhayakov and Phillipos watched the manhunt for the Tsarnaevs on television, Kadyrbayev discussed getting rid of the backpack with the fireworks with them. Kadrybayev placed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's backpack in a garbage bag and dropped it in a trash bin outside their apartment.  The FBI recovered the backpack a week later at a landfill. Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are both nationals of Kazakhstan who were temporarily living in the United States on student visas while attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.","Robel Phillipos convicted of lying to federal agents in Boston Marathon bombing probe .

"Colombia's top rebel group, FARC, announced Monday it will temporarily halt its decades-old battle against government forces starting at midnight as a goodwill gesture amid peace talks with the Colombia government. FARC commander Ivan Marquez announced the unilateral cease-fire and called on the the Colombian government to do the same as he arrived for peace talks at Cuba's Convention Palace in Havana Monday. ""Heeding the overwhelming demand for peace from diverse sectors of the country, the FARC secretariat orders guerrilla units across the country to cease military operations and acts of sabotage,"" Marquez said . The rebel cease-fire is scheduled to start Monday night and last until January 20, the rebel group said. It's unlikely the Colombian government will take part in the two-month truce: Bogota has said previously that it will not consider a cease-fire until after a final agreement is reached. FARC had signaled that it would pursue a cease-fire, even before peace talks, now being held in Havana, began in mid-October in Norway. Critics of the move believe it's just an attempt by the rebel group to rebuild its forces. The leftist FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, has been at war with the government since the 1960s, making it the longest-running insurgency in Latin America. The U.S. State Department, which has listed FARC as a terror group, posted a $5 million reward for the capture of Marquez, whose real name is Luciano Marin Arango. FARC child soldiers on the rise . There have been sporadic attempts at peace since the 1980s. The last attempt fell apart in 2002. Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position. But this time, both sides say, they have a more ambitious agenda. ""The end of the armed conflict is the precursor to peace. To achieve it, we have to go deep into the transformation of society,"" said Humberto de la Calle, a representative for the Colombian government. Five facts about the FARC rebels . The end of hostilities -- the kidnappings and bombings by the FARC and military operations by the government -- will not usher in peace without a true transformation within the country, he said. Ivan Marquez, a FARC representative, agreed. ""We are not the guerrillas that some media make us out to be,"" he said. ""We come to the table with proposals and projects to achieve a definitive peace, a peace that implies a demilitarization of the state and radical socioeconomic reforms that are the foundation of democracy, justice and freedom."" The FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces, though it has been severely weakened in recent years. Two days after peace talks began in Norway, an apparent FARC rebel attack killed five Colombian soldiers. FARC rebels release French journalist . A large distance remains between the sides. While the Colombian government has said that the FARC could continue to advocate for its positions as a political force, it does not want to negotiate all the group's demands during the peace talks.

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. military's Missile Defense Agency will practice protecting the United States from a simulated Iranian missile attack next month in an exercise using the agency's newest missile-killing technology, Pentagon officials said Friday. Previous tests have been focused on a missile trajectory that mimics an attack from North Korea, but the January test will have a trajectory and distance resembling an intercontinental ballistic missile launch from Iran. At the same time, the agency will be testing its new ""Capability-2"" technology, with upgraded software and sensors loaded inside an interceptor missile that will be fired at the fake Iranian missile. The Capability-2 technology is designed to eventually replace the existing hardware the United States has in its two missile defense bases in California and Alaska, according to Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency. While intelligence assessments of that country's capabilities now suggest an Iranian ICBM threat is as far away as 2020, this test was planned more than three years ago, when the threat seemed much closer, Lehner said. In the January test, the fake ICBM is slated to originate from the Missile Defense Agency's launch facility in the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific while the interceptor missile will be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, according to Lehner. Missile defense tests have been likened to hitting a bullet with a bullet. This test will be even more difficult: It will be like hitting a bullet head-on with another bullet, because any launch from Iran would have a trajectory that would require a U.S. interceptor missile hitting the target directly, Lehner said. The missiles will be flying at speeds of between 17,000 and 18,000 miles per hour, according to Lehner, about 3,000 mph faster than tests involving mock North Korean missiles. The speed will reduce the strike window, meaning the interceptor, also known as the ""kill vehicle,"" will have to work even faster at identifying and striking the target missile. The United States has only two missile defense bases, one at Vandenberg, with three missiles, and the other at Fort Greely, Alaska, with 20 interceptor missiles at the ready. Lehner said that if Iran were to launch an ICBM attack against the United States, the most likely defense option would be firing a missile from Alaska, because of the shorter distance around the globe. The United States was prepared to put a third missile defense site in eastern Europe, but the Obama administration scrapped that option because of the reduced ICBM threat from Iran. In its place, the administration said it will move ships with the capability of shooting down short- and medium-range missile from Iran which, they say, pose a greater threat to Iran's neighbors and U.S. bases in the Middle East.","Previous tests have been focused on a trajectory that mimics a North Korean attack .

"(CNN) -- Cheers in Moscow. Outrage in Kiev. Bloodshed in Simferopol. Tuesday saw Russian President Vladimir Putin announce the annexation of Crimea, two days after voters in that semiautonomous territory approved a hastily called referendum on separating from Ukraine. Putin told a joint session of Russia's Parliament that the nearly 97% of Crimean residents who voted to join Russia over the weekend was ""an extremely convincing figure."" ""In our hearts, we know Crimea has always been an inalienable part of Russia,"" he said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk called it ""a robbery on an international scale,"" one that Kiev will never accept. ""One country has come and temporarily stolen part of of the territory of an independent country,"" he said. ""It will be difficult to find a quick resolution to this problem, but Russia is now isolated by the whole international community."" And after a member of its military was killed, another wounded and more captured when masked gunmen seized their base near the Crimean regional capital, Simferopol, Ukraine's defense ministry authorized its forces to open fire. Yatsenyuk warned that the crisis was shifting ""from political to the military form, and the blame is on the Russian military."" Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority, has long been a semiautonomous region within Ukraine. It has had its own Parliament, but the Ukrainian government had veto power over its actions. After the revolt that forced pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych from office in February, Russian troops poured into the Crimean Peninsula, effectively cutting it off in support of a pro-Russian government that took power in Simferopol. Putin said Tuesday that Russia had to act as Ukraine's new government, backed by the United States and European powers, prepared ""to seize the state through terror and murders."" ""The main executors of this were nationalists, Russia-phobes and anti-Semites,"" he said. ""Those people define what is happening today in Ukraine."" But international observers have said Moscow saw its chance to annex a strategic territory, one that was transferred to Ukraine in the Soviet era and which still hosts the home port of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine's interim President, Oleksandr Turchynov, told reporters that Putin is ""mimicking the fascists of the last century"" by annexing Crimea. ""The political leadership of Russia will have to answer before the whole world for crimes they are committing today in our country,"" Turchynov said. Cameron: Annexation sends 'a chilling message' Putin declared Tuesday that ""We have not used our armed forces in Crimea,"" despite what has been stated by international observers and the government of Kiev. He said the 22,000 Russian troops in Crimea did not enter during the current crisis, but ""were already there,"" in accordance with previous international negotiations. Russian forces were allowed in Crimea under a treaty that allowed the Black Sea Fleet to be based there, but the movements of its forces within Crimea are supposed to be agreed upon with Kiev. Putin praised those forces for avoiding bloodshed, but the tensions appear to have boiled over into violence Tuesday. Masked gunmen killed a member of Ukraine's military, wounded another and arrested the remaining staff of Ukraine's military topographic and navigation directorate at Simferopol, Defense Ministry spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov told CNN. After that, the Defense Ministry authorized its forces in Crimea to use weapons ""to protect and preserve the life of Ukrainian soldiers,"" according to a statement posted on its website. Petro Poroshenko, a Ukrainian member of Parliament and former foreign minister, said Tuesday that his country stands at ""the beginning of a very dangerous conflict, and we should do our best to stop this process."" ""Several weeks ago, we had a guarantee that nothing [would] happen with the Crimea. Several weeks ago we had [a situation] that there is not any military presence on Ukrainian territory, including the Crimea,"" he told CNN's ""Amanpour "" program. Now, he said, ""I strongly believe that this is not only Ukrainian territory is now threatened."" ""Now under attack can be any country in the European Union, including other parts of Ukraine,"" said Poroshenko, a billionaire and leading potential candidate for president. ""That's why we should think that it can never happen again."" U.S. and EU officials imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials Monday and have urged Russia to avoid escalating the crisis, but Moscow has ignored those calls. Tuesday's annexation brought a new round of condemnation from the West, with British Prime Minister David Cameron saying it sends ""a chilling message across the continent of Europe."" ""It is completely unacceptable for Russia to use force to change borders, on the basis of a sham referendum held at the barrel of a Russian gun,"" Cameron said in a statement issued by Downing Street. ""President Putin should be in no doubt that Russia will face more serious consequences, and I will push European leaders to agree further EU measures when we meet on Thursday."" Russia faces 'more than just sanctions,' Biden says . The G7 group of industrialized nations had already suspended preparations for a planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi. Now, U.S. President Barack Obama has invited his counterparts from the other G7 countries and the European Union to a meeting of next week on the margins of a nuclear security summit in The Hague, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. The planned meeting comes amid speculation that Russia will get kicked out of the G8 -- which comprises the G7 countries plus Russia -- because of its actions in Crimea. In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry criticized ""this rise of a kind of nationalism that is exercised unilaterally, to the exclusion of the international legal process."" ""That's what we have worked hard to avoid ever since World War II,"" Kerry said. He acknowledged that Russia has interests in Crimea and ""an enormous historical connection to Ukraine,"" but said he was ""really struck and somewhat surprised and even disappointed"" by Putin's case for annexing the territory. ""With all due respect, it just didn't (jibe) with reality or what's happening on the ground,"" Kerry said. ""The President may have his version of history, but I believe that he and Russia, for what they have done, are on the wrong side of history."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the ""so-called referendum"" and the acceptance of Crimea to the Russian Federation ""goes against international law,"" while French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and a French delegation have postponed a planned visit to Moscow because of the Ukrainian situation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. And U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, dispatched to reassure NATO allies in Eastern Europe, said Russia faces ""more than just sanctions"" unless it abandons its ""land grab"" in Crimea. ""We're talking about Russia putting itself on a path that undermines long-term confidence and creates obstacles for its full participation in the global economy,"" Biden said after talks in Poland's capital, Warsaw. ""That path that they've placed themselves on does nothing to help the next generation of Russians compete and succeed in a world that will be led by the most dynamic and open economies."" Condemnation abroad, cheers at home . But lawmakers in Moscow met Putin's address with regular and enthusiastic applause. The Russian leader accused the West of ""double standards"" and cynicism in its response to the Crimean crisis, citing Kosovo -- which split from Russia's historical ally Serbia over fierce objections from Belgrade -- as a precedent. ""It's absolutely in favor of their own interests -- black today, white tomorrow,"" he said. Russia's Parliament is expected to vote on ratifying Crimea's accession to the Russian Federation by the end of the week. The speaker of Russia's upper house of Parliament, Valentina Matvineko, told state-run Russia-24 TV that the process of adding a new member to the Russian Federation ""can be done rather promptly."" And hours after the annexation announcement, Putin appeared at a huge celebration on Red Square organized by his supporters -- a sign of his widespread popularity at home. An opinion poll by the Moscow-based Levada Center puts his approval rating at 72% -- the highest in more than three years, and the second-highest point of his presidency. The highest point came in 2008, during Russia's conflict with Georgia, another former Soviet republic. ""Putin in many senses, on many levels, crystallizes the Russian national consciousness,"" biographer Alexander Korobko told CNN. ""For the past 100 years perhaps, we have never had a leader who would appeal to the Russian soul ... as much as Putin."" Most Russians and Crimeans feel Crimea ""is coming back home,"" and a country that can produce ""pretty much anything"" has little fear of sanctions, he said. ""It is absolutely not in the U.S. interest to impose sanctions on Russia, because who will take American astronauts to space if not us Russians?"" Korobko asked. Crimea's vote: Was it legal?

"Haiti's terror didn't end when the ground stopped shaking. Reports of rape and sexual violence have been all too common after the January 2010 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced almost 25% of the entire population. ""On the evening of January 20, several young men were firing gunshots in the air. They came into our shelter and grabbed my 19-year-old niece,"" one woman, Dina, told Amnesty International. ""They just came in, grabbed her and dragged her away. ... She was raped by several men. They took her at around 9 p.m. and let her go at around 2 a.m."" Another woman, Guerline, told the rights group that she and her 13-year-old daughter were attacked on the same night in March 2010. The men wore hoods and told Guerline that if she went to the police, she would be shot dead. ""There is nowhere safe where I can live, so I had to keep quiet,"" she said. ""I didn't take my daughter to the hospital. She was too scared. I sent her to another town where some relatives live."" In the days following the disaster, camps were set up to provide shelter for more than a million displaced Haitians. But these ""tent cities"" have been far from ideal, according to Malya Villard-Appolon, one of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes. ""After the earthquake, the situation was inhumane and degrading. There was no security. There was no food; there was no work,"" said Villard-Appolon, a rape survivor who co-founded an organization, KOFAVIV, that helps other victims find safety, medical aid and legal support. ""Two years after the earthquake, it is still the same,"" she said. ""The people are still under the tent, they don't have electricity, they are getting raped."" Nearly 370,000 people remain in displacement camps, according to the U.N. And gruesome reports of violence, inadequate health care and substandard living conditions have painted a picture of horror and hopelessness. In one study, published in January by the Center for Human Rights and Global Justice (PDF), 14% of households reported that at least one member of the household had been a victim of sexual violence since the earthquake. And 70% of households surveyed said they were now more worried about sexual violence. Residents have cited lack of lighting, long walks to the bathroom, and flimsy tents as some of the issues putting females at risk of attack. Many females also are on their own for the first time. ""Women and girls were left to fend for themselves in camps,"" said Anne-christine d'Adesky, project coordinator for PotoFanm+Fi, a nonprofit that has been working with more than 70 Haitian support groups to track post-earthquake violence. ""Because of the great displacement, people lost that sense of community protection."" Accurate numbers of gender-based violence are difficult to find in the aftermath of such devastation, especially when many victims fear retaliation. But d'Adesky said her group has seen a steady rise in reports, which she attributes to increased outreach. One young woman, Marie, was raped in the Champ de Mars camp and had her jaw broken. She said she was also forced into prostitution so she could eat and survive. High numbers of adolescent girls are engaging in what they call ""transactional sex"" for shelter and food, d'Adesky said. Many of those interviewed claimed they had never sold sex before, but the earthquake had left them no option. ""I call this gender aftershocks,"" said d'Adesky, whose group is publishing their report on Haiti next month. ""These women and girls have no means of survival and are engaging in transactional sex work -- or survival sex -- sometimes just for shelter."" And many of those women -- as well as those who have been raped -- are becoming pregnant, raising fears about rising maternal health issues. Even before the quake, Haiti was the most dangerous place to be pregnant in the Western Hemisphere: the lifetime risk of dying during childbirth there is 1 in 47. ""We followed up with a number of pregnant girls who were no longer pregnant,"" d'Adesky said. According to her sources, there has been a high rate of illegal street abortions and child abandonment. But amid the depressing and dire reports comes a glimmer of hope. KOFAVIV and other groups are working to help young girls and women, giving them safety, support and training so they can make money and not have to sell themselves. Better lighting has been installed in some displacement camps. More than 10,000 military and police personnel are now helping to provide security throughout the country, and hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers have been assigned to specifically work with the Haitian National Police. And in the last two years, there has been a big change in the way rape is prosecuted, according to legal experts. More women are reporting the crimes, and more rapists are being prosecuted. ""There has been a higher percentage of complaints that are turning into pre-trial investigations and are leading to formal charges,"" said Brian Concannon Jr., director of the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti. In the first two years after the quake, sources in Haiti had estimated there were few, if any, rape convictions. But this year there have already been more than 60 convictions for sex crimes in Haiti, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network. This summer, 22 rape cases were prosecuted and there were 13 convictions, said Meena Jagannath, a lawyer who has worked with Haitian rape victims. There was one acquittal, and eight of the trials were ""left blank"" for a number of reasons, including lack of representation for the victim who may not have even known she was to appear in court. ""It sounds like it's a small number, it sounds like more should have been filed since 2010,"" Jagannath said. ""But we should take into consideration the biases of the system and level of disorganization and corruption. It really is an accomplishment. I've heard those numbers are much higher now than even before the earthquake."" CNN Photos: Rape adds to Haitian camp woes . Concannon said Haiti's justice system has a history ""of not taking rape that seriously."" It wasn't until 2005 that rape was classified as a crime on par with an assault. Before that, rape was a ""crime against public morals,"" which Concannon says is something like a misdemeanor compared with a felony. Now the challenge is changing attitudes and empowering women to speak up. While it still can be difficult for many victims to file a police report and obtain the necessary medical documents needed to pursue justice, there are more resources for women who want to speak out. ""All this progress is the result of advocacy by KOFAVIV and other grassroots women's groups and their allies,"" Concannon said. ""I believe that the progress has the potential to play a key role in transforming attitudes about violence against women -- not just in the justice system, but in Haitian society as a whole.""

"State House Entebbe ebbed and flowed with dramatic contrasts: laughter at sexual jokes versus the pain of impending persecution and prosecution; Western freedoms clashing with African culture; an unwinnable battle between science and learned behavior; nature and nurture. Who decides? President Yoweri Museveni did, in this moment, inking into law harsh penalties for gay people, supported overwhelmingly by Ugandans. I was floored at the barrage of criticism belted out to The West. ""Arrogant western groups are to blame."" Applause. ""Leave us alone."" Applause. ""We don't need your (donor) money."" Huge applause. The press conference was attended by MPs, scientists, Ugandan officials and other journalists. I stepped out for a moment to do a report by telephone, which we call a beeper at CNN, and returned to a room that was pretty jovial. It felt uncomfortable to laugh about something that had such serious implications. ""What did I miss?"" I asked my producer Antonia. ""Something about the mouth being for kissing and eating only, and not for going south, only north,"" comments delivered by the president to more laughter, she said. I approached the mic and asked two questions that were significantly less amusing -- there was palpable tension in the room as a blanket of silence descended. I was in the minority, raising subjects like human rights and freedom of speech, and asking if he wasn't taking Uganda a step backwards in time? The response tore into Western values and ripped to shreds any willingness to tolerate Western ideas around sexuality or ""social imperialism,"" as the president put it. Now it's easy to roll your eyes but I know this region, and many Africans think the imposition of social norms by the U.S. or Western and former colonial powers is offensive and unwanted, though they love Western music, movies and cutting-edge technologies. Overall, East Africans are not generally anti-Western. I was shocked when Museveni declared, to even more clapping, that Uganda doesn't need aid money from the West. I turned to Antonia: ""Did he really just say that?"" She nodded and folded up the note we wrote to an aide requesting an exclusive interview with the president. Newsflash to me: I realized then that Uganda clearly didn't feel dependent on Western aid money. Perhaps China, a big Africa player, and Russia, could be stronger future allies. We caught the president on his way out of the room and he agreed to an exclusive CNN interview on the spot. We were whisked to the elegant boardroom and offices and set up. My colleagues Fabian and Antonia set up a two-camera shoot in five minutes. President Museveni made his argument: gay people are disgusting, and I made mine: they are not. He laid out his case based on the scientific research he was presented with and insisted homosexuality was a learned social behavior that can be unlearned. I was born and bred in Kenya and I believe that each individual has a right and the freedom to love whoever he or she chooses, gay, or straight. But here in Uganda, I am in the minority here. Why is he doing this? Moral conviction, but he is also looking ahead to the 2016 elections and the majority of his electorate is overwhelmingly anti-gay. However Museveni denies it is an election ploy. As I drove past the shimmering Lake Victoria, towards Kampala, one thing was for sure: It's going to take a long time before the West and Uganda can agree on this topic, if they ever will. For now, as the president articulated, the subject is ""a no-go area.""","CNN's Zain Verjee challenges Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni over new anti-gay law .

"It's thought to be the most-trafficked mammal in the world, but few people know that it exists. I recently introduced CNN Digital readers to the pangolin as part of my Change the List project, which focuses on bottom-of-the-list issues and places. See all of the pangolin stories at CNN.com/Change. The pangolin is a rare, scale-covered animal that rolls up into a ball to protect itself from predators and has a tongue that's longer than its body. It would be a shame if it went extinct simply because people are trafficking it for its meat and scales, which are ground up and used in traditional medicine in Vietnam and China. That could happen before people learn how interesting and important it is. I hope you'll use your voice to advocate for this loveable underdog. Here are seven ways you can help save the humble pangolin. 1. Fund a pangolin PSA in Vietnam . At least 10,000 pangolins are thought to be trafficked illegally each year. The trade, of course, would end if we could figure out how to curb the demand for pangolin in Vietnam and China, the two main consumer countries for pangolin products. The good folks at Education for Nature Vietnam, based in Hanoi, are trying to do just that -- and they will produce a pangolin-focused public service announcement to air on television in Vietnam if they can raise $5,000 for the effort. That's just to cover the costs of production. • Donate here: There's a link at top right for pangolin donations. I'll let you know whether enough money is raised to create the ad. Doug Hendrie, a technical adviser and manager of the group's wildlife crime and investigations unit, told me the PSA would be finished this year or early 2015. The PSA probably would focus on curbing demand for pangolin scales, which are easy enough to find a traditional medicine shops in Hanoi, even though selling the animals is illegal. The group has a history of making these PSAs and has produced them for a number of species (here's one called ""Killing tigers will not impress anyone"") but never the pangolin. 2. Support other worthy organizations . Environmental groups, on the whole, are doing far too little to support pangolin research and conservation. That's partly because they think the public loves all of the conventionally cute animals -- rhinos, tigers, elephants -- but doesn't care about oddballs like the pangolin. Help change their minds by donating to these CNN-vetted groups that are working to help stop the pangolin trade and are funding research to learn more about these secretive animals. • TRAFFIC: the wildlife trade monitoring network . • Wildlife Conservation Society (pangolin donation page) • Annamiticus . • Education for Nature Vietnam . 3. Petition Disney: Get a pangolin in an animated film! Part of the pangolin's problem is that it's just not popular like the animals that end up in Disney Pixar cartoons. If more people cared about the pangolin -- or even knew that it existed -- it might find a certain level of protection in celebrity. If someone starts a petition asking Disney Pixar to make a cartoon with a pangolin in it, I'll sign it, share it widely and put the link here. You can do that in a few clicks at Change.org or We the People. The pangolin would make a great cartoon character: shy, curious and able to roll down hills like a basketball. The heroic introvert! UPDATE: Sign this reader-started Change.org petition: ""Help beautiful and mysterious pangolins by featuring them in an animated movie!"" 4. Read ""Roly Poly Pangolin"" to your kids . Anna Dewdney, author of the ""Llama llama"" series of children's books, wrote a fun little book called ""Roly Poly Pangolin,"" about a shy animal that learns to find a friend. A portion of the book's proceeds go the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program at Cuc Phuong National Park in Vietnam, which rescues pangolins and prepares them for release back into the wild. 5. Spread the word: Help us make the pangolin popular . Disney's great, but -- also -- who needs Disney? There are plenty of things you can do on your own to spread awareness about the pangolin. Share this story. Share the main piece in this series -- ""The most trafficked mammal you've never heard of"" -- and share these some of these educational (and entertaining) pangolin resources: . • IUCN Pangolin Specialist Group: A group of researchers and conservationists dedicated to finding out more about the pangolin and raising its international profile. • Honey Badger II: The guy behind that viral honey badger video made a new (hilarious) video about pangolins as part of this CNN project. Check it out on his YouTube channel. • SavePangolins.org: A great website with lots of info about what makes pangolins unique. It also has other ideas about how people can get involved. 6. Demand better law enforcement in Southeast Asia . In Vietnam, it wasn't hard at all for me to find pangolin scales and meat for sale. And in Indonesia, I heard that parks have only a small fraction of the rangers they would need to adequately protect the pangolin and other endangered wildlife. Bribes and corruption are commonplace. Help pressure these countries to take the illegal pangolin trade seriously. They could shut it down with more funding and effort. Currently, this species is too low of a priority. Two groups working to do that are TRAFFIC, which operates throughout Southeast Asia, and Education for Nature Vietnam, a nonprofit in Hanoi. Both conduct their own wildlife crime investigations and work with authorities to break up these networks. 7. Submit a better name for P26, a pangolin in Vietnam . The Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program released a pangolin named P26 into the wild in late March. What kind of name is that? It sounds like a robot. Help come up with a better name for the pangolin. CNN readers are basically adopting this little guy, and we'll be following his journey as he acclimates to the wild.","Pangolins are thought to be the most-trafficked mammals in the world .

"Aarti Aziz and her husband Moosa are locked inside a pitch-black concrete dugout in Mexico, sweating in unbearable heat. With them is a shaman who has been chanting ceaselessly for the past two hours as strange vapors swirl around them. It may sound like a harrowing ordeal, but it's one the couple volunteered for. This is the world of Temazcal, a practice dating back centuries to when Mexico's Mayan Riviera was wilderness and the Mayan civilization was at the height of its power. Temazcal entails entering a stone igloo with little or no clothing on and sweating it out to the sound of chanting and the fragrance of herbs. Typically carried out for small groups by a shaman who's usually a member of one of the Mayan communities in the surrounding area, the process lasts two hours. It can be a tough experience. Anyone with diabetes or heart disease should forget it, while those susceptible to claustrophobia or skepticism, might think twice. Even skeptics, however, can rest assured that they'll come out from their two-hour session feeling refreshed, invigorated and a probably a few pounds lighter. During the session, rosemary, basil and peppermint and other scents waft over a vapor created by the shaman as he or she gently throws water over a pile of hot rocks in a pit in the middle of the floor. Visitors are kept hydrated with herbal tea and are permitted to lie down, walk around, or sit still -- whatever it takes to cleanse body and mind. But once they check in, they can't check out. ""I did freak out a bit when the shaman covered the dugout's door with a thick blanket,"" says Aziz, who experienced a Temazcal in Tulum, on southeastern Mexico's Yucatan Peninsular. Inner child . Her eyes soon adjusted to the darkness and she enjoyed a comfortable two hours. ""The only light we ever saw were the brief sparks from the rocks when the water was poured on them,"" she adds. Her husband says he found the shaman's constant chanting -- urging him to direct his woes and pains toward the smoldering rocks to rid his body of hatred and lighten his mental load  -- a tad hokey, but the ambiance eventually caught up with him. When the shaman told him to ""let his inner child out,"" he laughed loudly as directed, carried away by the mood. The couple emerged from their session feeling refreshed and lighter -- physically and mentally. ""My skin felt amazingly soft,"" adds Aarti. ""The ancient Maya respected the steam bath's efficacy and power for treating both physical and spiritual diseases,"" says Rosita Arvigo, author of ""Spiritual Bathing: Healing Rituals and Traditions from Around the World."" A doctor of naprapathy -- a science similar to chiropractic manipulation -- who's trained in Central American traditional medicine, Arvigo says steam bath buildings made out of stone were a part of every major Maya ceremonial center. Some are still intact in various parts of Mexico. Hallucinogenic drugs . While technically the word Temazcal is not Mayan, but Aztec, ancient Mayans -- athletes, priests, kings -- regularly engaged in these sweaty detox sessions and  took hallucinogenic drugs such as peyote to further enhance the experience. Visitors are unlikely to be offered any peyote today, but just about every hotel in the touristy cities of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum offers a version of a Temazcal. Many actually have a stone dugout, or sweat lodge, on their premises. They're the main attraction for most travelers, says Barbara Varicchio, head of sales and promotion for Dos Palmas Eco Tours, an organization that arranges Temazcals and works closely with Mayan communities in the region around Playa del Carmen. Varicchio attests that the physical benefits are many. She says the vapor created by the mix of essential herbs clears the digestive tract, improves blood circulation, energizes tired muscles and clears the skin. And finally, partaking in the experience helps develop tourism, in the best way. ""By keeping the ancient steam bath practice alive, we are encouraging sustainable tourism and enabling traditional communities to earn their livelihood by doing what their ancestors did,"" she says.

"After five years in captivity, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is free. But that's hardly the end of the story. While the Idaho man's friends and family and the Obama administration are hailing his release, the deal that set him free is getting heat from critics who say Bergdahl is a traitor who cost American lives and those who say the deal could cost American lives in the future. A captive U.S. soldier returns home ... sounds like a good thing. Why are some people so upset? Some fear that the deal will encourage hostage-taking and open a new era in which the United States has to negotiate with terrorists. Others say the administration may have broken the law by failing to notify Congress that it was letting terror detainees free from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Still others -- many of them Bergdahl's fellow soldiers -- are queasy about the whole thing because of the questions that continue to swirl around his disappearance and claims that he may have deserted his post. Don't other countries make such swaps? Hasn't the United States? Of course. Prisoner exchanges have been a feature of many U.S. conflicts going back to the Revolutionary War. And no student of Cold War history could overlook the exchange of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for a Russian spy in 1962, or of the several cloak-and-dagger spy exchanges conducted on Germany's Glienicke Bridge. Other countries, notably Israel, have also been known to negotiate prisoner swaps to gain the release of captive soldiers. One controversy here is a U.S. law that requires the administration to give Congress notice 30 days before releasing any detainees from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Sunday on CNN that the ""acute urgency"" of Bergdahl's failing health and what she described as a narrow opportunity to win his freedom justified making the move without notifying Congress. On Monday, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough defended the administration's handling of the negotiations, saying Congress had known for years of negotiations for Bergdahl's release, including the possibility that detainees might be released. But several U.S. lawmakers on Monday criticized the White House's approach. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday that lawmakers on her committee should have been given a heads-up about the prisoner swap. ""We had participated in a number of briefings some time ago, and there (were) considerable concerns,"" the California Democrat said. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman the House Intelligence Committee, said he planned to look into whether Obama broke the law by not notifying Congress 30 days in advance. ""I think it certainly merits further review, and that's what I'm going to do to make that determination,"" the Michigan Republican told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""It certainly doesn't smell right to me."" So who is this guy, and how did he wind up getting captured, anyway? Friends describe him as a trustworthy and outgoing world traveler who joined the Army in 2008. How he ended up captive remains a bit of a mystery. U.S. officials have declined to go into detail, but soldiers in his platoon say he was pulling guard duty when he put down his weapons and walked off base. He reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing U.S. activities in Afghanistan, according to 2012 reporting by late Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings. What are the soldiers who served with him saying? Bluntly, they resent any talk of Bergdahl as a hero. They say he's a deserter who should be put on trial, especially in light of the deaths of at least six U.S. soldiers killed while looking for him. ""I was pissed off then and I am even more so now with everything going on,"" said Matt Vierkant, who was in the same platoon as Bergdahl. ""Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him."" ""I don't understand why we're trading prisoners at Gitmo for somebody who deserted during a time of war, which is an act of treason,"" Vierkant said. Are they right? Was he a deserter? U.S. officials aren't saying that, at least not directly. When asked about the issue Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sidestepped the question. ""Our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family,"" Hagel said. ""Other circumstances that may develop and questions, those will be dealt with later."" On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby said U.S. officials ""still don't have a complete picture of what caused him to leave his base that night."" ""But let's not forget, he was held captive as a prisoner for five years. Five years by himself,"" Kirby said. ""That's a pretty high price to pay for whatever impelled him to walk off that base."" So what's next for him? He's at an American military hospital in Germany being evaluated by doctors and facing a lengthy repatriation and reintegration process. He's in stable condition ""receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization,"" Landstuhl Regional Medical Center said in a statement. Beyond saying he requires attention to ""dietary and nutrition needs,"" the hospital didn't elaborate, citing medical privacy requirements. ""The Landstuhl staff is sensitive to what Sgt. Bergdahl has been through and will proceed with his reintegration at a pace with which he is comfortable,"" the hospital said. Those in charge of treating Bergdahl are working to build up his confidence in them, a senior Defense Department official said, noting that Bergdahl hasn't been able to trust anyone for five years. Doctors in Germany are evaluating his health and whether he's ready to be transported, said Arwen Consaul, a spokeswoman for U.S. Army South. Once doctors give the OK, a receiving team will travel there to facilitate his transport to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. From there, he'll head to the San Antonio Military Medical Center, where a room is already ready for Bergdahl and a support team is standing by, Consaul said. He hasn't yet talked to his family, Kirby said. ""That will obviously occur, but it won't occur until I think everybody believes it's the right time,"" he said. The first meeting between Bergdahl and his parents may only last minutes, Consaul said, depending on what psychologists recommend. Once in the United States, she said, Bergdahl's daily routine will focus on four key areas: medical care, psychological support, debriefings and family support. ""This is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step,"" she said. Is it true he's having trouble speaking English? Why? Yes, according to a senior Defense Department official, but the reasons for it aren't clear. It may be that he hasn't used English since he was captured, instead speaking to his captors in Pashtun, the local language. Roy Hallums, a private contractor held by Iraqi insurgents for 10 months, said he didn't have trouble readjusting to English, but said he couldn't talk for a while because he had been forced to stay silent under threat of death. ""It's like your vocal chords are like your muscles in your arms. If they don't get any use, they get out of shape,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" What about these detainees the U.S. let go? Should we worry about them? According to senior U.S. officials, they're mid- to high-level officials from the Taliban regime that ruled Afghanistan when the United States invaded the country. They include figures said to be linked to the late terror leader Osama bin Laden, his al Qaeda terror network and to abuses inside Afghanistan during the Taliban's rule. But Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials have received assurances from Qatari officials that the men ""were not going to pose a direct threat to the national security of the United States."" He declined to go into detail, but according to a senior defense official, they will be subject to Qatari supervision and a one-year travel ban. Should we expect any more prisoner swaps or releases? There aren't any other U.S. military personnel being held, so there won't be any more swaps involving troops, at least. But it's possible that Bergdahl's release presages a broader release of Afghan citizens from Guantanamo Bay, said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen. ""At the end of hostilities, both sides typically swap prisoners, and we're coming to the end of conventional hostilities between these two groups,"" he said. The State Department said Monday that the swap for Bergdahl doesn't set a precedent for other detained U.S. military or diplomatic personnel, like former State Department contractor Alan Gross in Cuba or Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae in North Korea. ""We look at each case differently,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters. Bergdahl ""is a member of the military who was detained during an armed conflict. That, obviously, is a unique circumstance,"" she said. ""In any case, whether it's Alan Gross or Kenneth Bae or others who are detained American citizens, we take every step possible to make the case and to ... take steps to ensure their return home to the United States."" What's next for Bergdahl? Fellow soldiers call Bergdahl a deserter, not a hero .","Feinstein: Lawmakers should've gotten heads-up about prisoner swap .

"A lay Baptist preacher or a brutal national leader found guilty of war crimes by an international court: in Charles Taylor, the myth and the man, became inseparable. Accusations of cannibalism swirled around the former Liberian president even as he quoted scripture to his supporters, many of whom he was accused of terrorizing into voting for him during the 1997 elections. Taylor has been a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades, with his overthrow of the regime of Samuel Doe in 1989, spiraling the country into a bloody civil war that left 200,000 dead over the next 14 years. He was infamous for filling his forces' ranks with drugged child soldiers who reportedly called him ""Pappy."" Look at high-res photos of the Charles Taylor years . But it was over his involvement in the civil war in Sierra Leone that Taylor was indicted and put on on trial in 2007 at the Special Court for Sierra Leone sitting in The Hague, Netherlands. United Nations officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The first African leader to appear before an international war crimes tribunal, he pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and other violations of international humanitarian law. But he was found guilty of aiding rebels who raped, killed and mutilated civilians in neighboring Sierra Leone. Prosecutors failed to convince a judge that Taylor had command over the rebels but he could still face a lengthy jail term when he is sentenced on May 30. For victims in Sierra Leone, Taylor's verdict brings relief . Speaking at a sentencing hearing at the court on Wednesday, Taylor said terrible things happened in Sierra Leone that could not be justified, but added that his role in the conflict had been misunderstood. ""What I did to bring peace to Sierra Leone was done with honor,"" Taylor said. ""I pushed the peace process hard. Contrary of how I have been portrayed in this court."" Prosecutors had accused Taylor of arming rebel groups and terrorizing civilians during the decade-long Sierra Leonean civil war in exchange for uncut diamonds smuggled out to him in empty mayonnaise jars. During the trial British supermodel Naomi Campbell was summoned as a witness for the prosecution. She told the court she received a gift of ""dirty-looking stones"" from two men following a dinner hosted by then-South African President Nelson Mandela in 1997. The prosecution argued the stones were ""blood diamonds"" -- a personal gift from Taylor. That claim contradicted Taylor's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict. What are 'blood diamonds?' It was one of the many instances of high drama in a trial that started with Taylor's dismissal of his entire defense team. But always lurking behind the spectacle of the trial was the specter of the more than 50,000 killed, maimed or missing in Sierra Leone's civil war. According to Amnesty International, that conflict ""was characterized by some of the worst abuses known: widespread deliberate and arbitrary killings of civilians, torture, including rape and deliberate amputation of limbs, and abduction and forced recruitment of large numbers of people, including children."" Deliberating for more than 12 months, they waded through 50,000-plus pages of testimony and examined more than 1,500 exhibits. Sierra Leone remains one of the most impoverished countries in the world and many of those who survived the civil war still bear its scars. U.S. degree . Taylor remained in power for six years until 2003 when heavy international pressure forced him from office. He lived in exile in Nigeria, where border guards arrested him in 2006 as he was attempting to cross into Chad. Born in 1948, Taylor was the third of 15 children of Americo-Liberian parents, descendants of the freed American slaves who established the Liberian republic in the 19th century. His father sent him to the United States, where he obtained a degree in economics from Bentley College in Massachusetts. He became involved in radical Liberian student politics. Influenced by Marxist and Pan-African ideas, he once advocated burning down the Liberian Embassy in Washington. He earned cash in his spare time working on a production line at a toy factory. He became a teacher and was part of Doe's government in 1980 before being exiled to the United States. In the U.S. he was jailed for allegedly stealing $900,000 in Liberian government funds -- only to escape from a Massachusetts prison, along with four petty criminals, in 1985 after a year in captivity. In 1989, he returned to West Africa and launched a revolt from the Ivory Coast against Doe, an ethnic Krahn who had taken power in a military coup. Taylor's campaign turned into an ethnic conflict, with seven factions fighting for control of the country and its resources -- particularly iron ore, timber and rubber. Taylor's forces included children, often dressed in costumes and blond wigs. Often under the influence of drugs, they were noted for their brutality.","Charles Taylor found guilty by U.N. court of war crimes in Sierra Leone civil war .

"Washington (CNN)  -- A former State Department employee and his wife, accused of illegally aiding the government of Cuba for nearly 30 years, pleaded guilty Friday to federal charges. Walter Kendall Myers, 72, pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit espionage and two counts of wire fraud. He agreed to forfeit $1.7 million related to the two counts of wire fraud and to serve a life prison sentence. His wife, Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers, 71, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to gather and transmit national defense information. She agreed to serve a sentence of between 6 and 7½ years in prison. The couple, who appeared in U.S. District Court on Friday, were captured June 4 after an FBI agent posing as a Cuban intelligence officer managed to coax them into offering information on U.S. government personnel, authorities said. In a diary quoted in the federal affidavit released in June, Myers expressed his opinions on the flaws of the United States and the appeal of Cuba. ""The abuses of our system, the lack of decent medical system, the oil companies and their undisguised indifference to public needs, the complacency about the poor, the utter inability of those who are oppressed to recognize their own condition ...,"" he wrote of the United States. ""Have the Cubans given up their personal freedom to get material security? Nothing I have seen yet suggests that,"" he wrote. ""I can see nothing of value that has been lost by the revolution. The revolution has released enormous potential and liberated the Cuban spirit."" The indictment said Kendall Myers, known to Cuban intelligence as Agent 202, and Gwendolyn Myers, known as Agent 123 and Agent E-634, engaged in activities ""which spanned nearly three decades."" Conviction on the wire fraud charge would carry a sentence of up to 20 years, illegally acting as an agent of a foreign government would carry a sentence of up to 10 years, and the conspiracy charge would carry a sentence of up to five years. A Justice Department official previously told CNN that counterespionage agents had gathered information on the couple and set up an April 15 meeting at which an FBI undercover agent convinced the couple he had been contacted by Cuban intelligence and was to ascertain the scope of their activities. They fell for the ruse, the department said. According to court documents, the couple disclosed they had received coded messages via short-wave radio, had met with Cuban agents in Mexico and had been carefully watching for any sign of U.S. surveillance. An affidavit released by the court said Kendall Myers first traveled to Cuba in 1978 and Cuban intelligence then began to develop him as a Cuban agent. Six months later, Myers and his wife agreed to work for the Cuban service, it said. After the April 15 meeting, the Myerses allegedly agreed to provide the undercover agent with information on the April 17-19 Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago, which President Obama attended. Kendall Myers confided to the undercover agent that he had received a ""lot of medals"" from the Cuban government for his work and that he and his wife met and spent an evening with Fidel Castro in 1995. The affidavit quoted Kendall Myers as telling the undercover agent that he typically removed information from the State Department by memory or by taking notes, although he did occasionally take some documents home. He also said he had delivered information that was classified as secret. Myers retired from the State Department on October 31, 2007. He had viewed more than 200 classified reports on Cuba in his final months, even though he was at the time an analyst working on European issues, the court document said. CNN's Paul Courson contributed to this report.","Walter Kendall Myers, 72, Gwendolyn Myers, 71, accused of aiding Cuba .

"So, Justin Bieber has done something stupid again. This time, he made the headlines by allegedly smoking pot on a chartered airplane and being rude and verbally abusive to the crew on a flight to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Is he just another rich teen idol blowing off a little testosterone? Sure. But seriously, his bad behavior is getting a bit out of control. For those who may never have flown aboard a charter, think of it like a bigger, swankier limousine where the passengers in the back are pretty much free to do whatever they want. In a regular airplane, the line in the sand is a bit clearer when it comes to passenger conduct. Unruly behavior is not tolerated on airlines like Delta or American Airlines. Get rowdy and obnoxious enough and most captains would tell the passengers they were landing the airplane at the nearest airport if they didn't calm down. On the chartered airplane that carried Bieber, his father and 10 friends, the flight attendant was verbally abused so much so that she took refuge near the cockpit, according to a police report. The report also said that the captain asked the Beiber entourage more than once to stop smoking marijuana, but those demands were ignored. Worried that the intoxicating fumes would eventually make their way to the cockpit, the pilots donned their emergency oxygen masks. Luckily, all went well and the airplane landed safely. In the great rulebook of flying, this easily qualifies as interference with the flight crew. However, even though the plane was met by Customs agents and the police upon landing, and the cabin still smelled like marijuana, none of the crew members wanted to press charges. Who has the resources to sue a pop star who can hire the best lawyer money can buy? Bieber got off easy in this incident. But it could have been a disaster. What if the crew of the chartered jet, trying to be nice to this unruly bunch of well-paying customers, hadn't put on the oxygen masks? What if the fumes had gotten them high before they put on those masks? Instead of a bunch of crazies arguing with the flight crew, you could have a flight crew impaired as well. Imagine a now-impaired flight crew approaching some of the busiest airspace in the world. Could they have managed to get the airplane down on the ground in one piece? Maybe. But maybe not, because when you're impaired your thinking is off. Or, what if one of the passengers, already high as a kite, had wandered up front and distracted the pilots (chartered planes don't usually have the same secure doors as airliners) ... just enough that they missed an important radio call or failed to notice another nearby airplane? If you were on an airliner headed for Newark or LaGuardia, how would you feel knowing the guys in some nearby business jet are loopy? Or imagine if the airplane had slid off the runway during landing, or sailed through the airport fence because the crew wasn't really in control? The profit the charter company made carrying the Bieber entourage would not even cover the attorney's fees in a lawsuit. The flight attendant on the flight said she'd never fly with these passengers again, and good for her. The charter company should never carry the Bieber entourage again, either, because these people don't belong in an airplane where they can hurt someone else. Most captains I know would have put the safety of the crew, the passengers and the people on the ground above everything else. Should any company fly Bieber after this? I hope not, but a wealthy pop star usually gets his way.","Justin Bieber and his entourage smoked pot a charter plane, says police report .
Robert Mark: Bieber has been getting in trouble lately, but this is getting out of line .

"(CNN) -- Another day, another FIFA farce. Football's world governing body has already embarrassed itself on a number of occasions with its president, Sepp Blatter, also getting in on the act. Thursday's debate between lead investigator Michael Garcia and FIFA judge Hans-Joachim Eckert over allegations of corruption during the FIFA World Cup bidding process is just the latest episode in a whole catalog of ignominy. Blatter, who has been in charge of FIFA since 1998, is hoping to stand for a fifth term as president next year. The 78-year-old has presided over some of the organization's most troubled times. Here are a few reminders. Racism solved with a handshake . Yes, you read that right. In June 2011, during an exclusive interview with CNN, Sepp Blatter said that any racism on the field of play could be solved with a handshake. When asked if racism on the pitch was a problem, the FIFA president said: "" ""I would deny it. There is no racism. ""There is maybe one of the players towards another -- he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one. ""But the one who is affected by that, he should say: 'This is a game. We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands.' And this can happen, because we have worked so hard against racism and discrimination."" Blatter later said that his remarks had been misunderstood and released a statement clarifying his position. Let women wear 'tighter shorts' Blatter caused a stir in January 2004 when he suggested female footballers should wear ""more feminine clothes."" ""Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball,"" he said at the time. ""They could, for example, have tighter shorts."" Blatter added: ""Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so, and they already have some different rules to men -- such as playing with a lighter ball. ""That decision was taken to create a more female aesthetic, so why not do it in fashion?"" No sex in Qatar . When Qatar was awarded the 2022 World Cup, Blatter was asked about what gay football fans should do given that homosexuality is illegal in the Gulf state. Speaking in December 2010, Blatter joked: ""I'd say they (gay fans) should refrain from any sexual activities."" Blatter later apologized. ""It was not my intention and never will be my intention to go into any discrimination,"" Blatter said. ""If somebody feels hurt, then I regret and present apologies."" She's a looker . Blatter was at it again in May 2013 at the 63rd FIFA congress held in Mauritius where the executive committee elected three women. With the world waiting to hail FIFA's progress, the president took center stage. He declared: ""We now have three ladies on the board. Say something, ladies! You are always speaking at home, say something now!"" Oh and before that, he had told everyone that one of the candidates, Australia's Moya Dodd was ""good and good-looking."" Affairs are OK? In 2010, Blatter turned agony uncle to England's Wayne Bridge following revelations that his Chelsea teammate, John Terry, had been having an affair with his girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel. The English Football Association (FA) stripped Terry of the England captaincy and Bridge's relationship with the French model fell apart in front of the watching world. Fortunately, Bridge had Blatter to turn to for some advice. ""Listen, this is a special approach in the Anglo-Saxon countries,"" he said. ""If this had happened in let's say Latin countries then I think he (Terry) would have been applauded."" Big screen Blatter . Nothing massages the ego more than having your own film -- hence the production of ""United Passions,"" a movie telling the story of how FIFA came into existence. FIFA coughed up a reported $8 million to help fund the film starring Tim Roth as Blatter, French actor Gerard Depardieu as World Cup creator Jules Rimet and Sam Neill as Joao Havelange, the disgraced former FIFA president. The flick, which reportedly cost $27 million to make, failed to attract many viewers to its premiere in Switzerland earlier this year -- a reported 120 people bought tickets. Sepp the stand-up comedian . In October 2013, Blatter caused much mirth during a question and answer session at Oxford University. The Swiss was asked which player he preferred out of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. One might have expected a straight answer -- but not this time. After saying that Ronaldo was like a ""commander on the field of play,"" Blatter got up from his chair and began to do a comic walk across the stage in a bizarre interpretation of the Real Madrid star's movement. It went down like a lead balloon -- especially with the Portuguese star who posted a sarcastic response on his Facebook page. The two made peace in the end with Blatter tweeting an apology.

"The internet in Africa is entirely different to the internet used in the developed world. In America or Europe, the internet is generally something you surf on a computer or tablet -- a device with a 10-inch to 15-inch screen. In Africa, hundreds of millions of people will experience the internet for the first time on a 2-inch cellphone screen. Probably in black and white. And probably only as text. They may not even know they are using the internet. Google, for instance, offers search and Gmail via SMS, the text message service that is still the most popular form of communication. Text messaging is important because it works on any kind of phone, especially the older so-called feature phones that still dominate. While the rest of the developed world is rushing headlong into smartphone heaven -- with powerful touchscreen devices that are more mini computer than voice-calling phone -- Africa's workhorses are the kind of phone seen in European cities circa 1998. The reason is simple: With a dearth of infrastructure, the vast majority of people (an estimated 1.5-billion globally, according to the UN) have no electricity. More people in Africa have a mobile phone than access to electricity.  That means, for a phone to be functional, it needs decent battery life. These feature phones have anywhere up to a week. Secondly, many have the two other must-have features: an FM radio and a torch. Radio remains the killer app in Africa, especially for mass communication. Read more: How cultural differences affect mobile use . Historically Africa has been bereft of wired telecoms infrastructure. There was a statistic bandied about in the 1990s that Manhattan had more phone lines than the 55 countries in Africa. Impossible to verify, but it reveals the scale of the communications problem. Until mobile phones came along, that is. Cellphones have made it possible for anyone to have a phone -- to make calls, send SMSes and, using clever payment systems like Kenya's M-Pesa, send mobile money to another phone user. Half of Kenya's GDP now moves through mobile money, and M-Pesa reportedly handles $20-million a day in transactions. Mobile money is projected to become a $617-billion industry by 2016, according to researchers Gartner, who predict mobile transactions will reach $171-billion this year. Already, 80% of the world's mobile money transactions are happening in East Africa, driven by Kenya, the epicentre of mobile innovation. Other services are also flourishing: ways for consumers to check whether medicine is authentic and hasn't expired (mPedigree); for farmers to find out where they can get the best price for their produce (Farmerline); for people to do real-time live mapping of disasters or elections (Ushahidi); and for communities to communicate with each other (Mxit and FrontlineSMS). Read more: 7 ways mobile has changed lives in Africa . Africa, once labeled the ""hopeless continent"" by The Economist a decade ago, is leading the way. The Economist renamed us the ""hopeful continent"" last year, after it noted that six of the 10 fastest growing economies in the last decade were in Africa. Africa has about one billion people, but already has an estimated 700 million SIM cards (by Q1 2012). It's important to note these are SIM cards and not users. Many people, myself included, have at two or three SIM cards, and perhaps a 3G data dongle. Because cellphone operators charge interconnect fees to make a call to another network, many people simply have a SIM card for each network and swap them out of their phone when they want to make calls. Savvy to the various offers -- including ones for cheaper on-network calls in the evenings and weekends -- family members or students use different networks at different times of the day to stay in touch. Mobile phones, by their nature, are better suited to Africa's historical inadequacies and current challenges. Smartphones, which are growing but not nearly at the same rate as in the developed world, are appearing; and with them, an app market is slowly developing. Computers have always been too expensive for the majority of Africans, most of whom have never had a home phone line. A cellphone is cheaper to buy, cheaper to run and is always on you. In South Africa, for instance, Google says 25% of its searches during the week are via mobile, rising to 65% on the weekends. Simply put, Africa is not just a mobile-first continent. It is mobile-only. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion .","The first time most Africans use the internet is on a mobile phone, says Toby Shapshak .

"Katie Hall was shocked the second she saw it: a light-bulb glowing in the middle of a room with no wires attached. Looking back, it was a crude experiment, she remembers: a tiny room filled with gigantic copper refrigerator coils -- the kind you'd see if you cracked open the back of your freezer. She walked in and out between the coils and the bulb -- and still the bulb glowed. ""I said: 'Let's work on this. This is the future.'"" What's the trick? ""We're going to transfer power without any kind of wires,"" says Dr Hall, now Chief Technology Officer at WiTricity, a startup developing wireless ""resonance"" technology. ""But, we're not actually putting electricity in the air. What we're doing is putting a magnetic field in the air."" It works like this: WiTricity builds a ""Source Resonator,"" a coil of electrical wire that generates a magnetic field when power is attached. If another coil is brought close, an electrical charge can be generated in it. No wires required. ""When you bring a device into that magnetic field, it induces a current in the device, and by that you're able to transfer power,"" explains Dr Hall. And like that, the bulb lights up. Wireless homes . Don't worry about getting zapped: Hall assures that the magnetic fields used to transfer energy are ""perfectly safe"" -- in fact, they are the same kind of fields used in Wi-Fi routers. In the house of the future, wire-free energy transfer could be as easy as wireless internet. If all goes to WiTricity's plans, smartphones will charge in your pocket as you wander around, televisions will flicker with no wires attached, and electric cars will refuel while sitting on the driveway. WiTricity has already demonstrated the ability to power laptops, cell-phones, and TVs by attaching resonator coils to batteries -- and an electric car refueler is reportedly in the works. Hall sees a bright future for the family without wires: . ""We just don't think about it anymore: I'm going to drive my car home and I'm never going to have to go to the gas station and I'm never going to have to plug it in. ""I can't even imagine how things will change when we live like that."" World outside . Beyond these effort-saving applications, Hall sees more revolutionary steps. When Hall first saw the wireless bulb, she immediately thought of medical technology -- seeing that devices transplanted beneath the skin could be charged non-intrusively. WiTricity is now working with a medical company to recharge a left-ventricular assist device -- ""a heart-pump, essentially."" The technology opens the door to any number of mobile electronic devices which have so far been held back by limited battery lives. ""The idea of eliminating cables would allow us to re-design things in ways that we haven't yet thought of, that's just going to make our devices and everything that we interact with, that much more efficient, more practical and maybe even give brand new functionality."" What's next? The challenge now is increasing the distance that power can be transferred efficiently. This distance --  Hall explains -- is linked to the size of the coil, and WiTricity wants to perfect the same long-distance transfers to today's small-scale devices. For this reason, the team have high hopes for their new creation: AA-sized wirelessly rechargeable batteries. For Hall, the applications are endless: ""I always say kids will say: 'Why is it called wireless?'"" ""The kids that are growing up in a couple of years will never have to plug anything in again to charge it."" *UPDATE (March 17) It's great to see so much discussion of this technology on social media and the comments thread. There seems to be a lot of interest in the contribution of Nikola Tesla's experiments to the development of this technology. Dr Hall discussed Tesla briefly in her interview with Nick Glass: . Nick Glass: Given that Tesla and others realized all this over a Century ago, why's it taken so long? Dr Hall: I don't think they realized exactly what we've done. They were certainly dreaming of wireless power -- there's no question about that.  In those days, it was a different problem, because they were really thinking about: how do they get the power from where it's generated to where it's used. And in that case they might have been thinking about Niagara Falls generating the power and getting it to New York City -- and that's a long distance. We're not proposing that the technology we have here at WiTricity would be used for that kind of application. When we came around, power's already being transferred by wires to homes and rooms and things of that nature, so we had a much different problem, which was really just this much shorter distance. As WiTricity has mentioned on its website, its Highly Resonant Wireless Power Transfer technology is also distinct from Tesla's creations -- and is efficient enough to be economically viable.","Dr Katie Hall is developing ways to transfer power without wires .
In the home of the future, wireless energy will be as common as Wi-Fi, she believes .
The technology could lead to new and revolutionary medical devices ."
"(CNN) -- People across Egypt took to the streets on Tuesday in demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies, rallies partly inspired by similar protests that rocked Tunisia this month. Thousands were protesting in the capital of Cairo, according to the ""Front to Defend Egypt Protesters,"" an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events. At first, witnesses said, the police were restrained in Cairo. But later, they said, police fired around a dozen rounds of tear gas on the protesters, and people in the crowd threw the canisters back at the officers. The group said about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of Aswan, 2,000 in the eastern city of Ismailiya, and about 3,000 in the northern city of Mahallah. Protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by Tunisians, who 10 days ago forced the collapse of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 23-year rule. 'Winds of change' blowing through Middle East and North Africa . The Egyptian government did not issue permits for Tuesday's planned protests. In an interview released Tuesday with state-run al-Ahram newspaper, Interior Minister Habib Adly warned that ""the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend"" the demonstrations and called the efforts of the ""youth staging street protests ineffective."" By early Tuesday morning, more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the event in a Facebook group called ""We Are All Khaled Said,"" named after an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police. The Facebook group demands raising the minimum wage, sacking the interior minister, creating two-term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says ""resulted in police control"" over the people and the nation. To highlight the role of police corruption, organizers tapped January 25 -- Police Day and a national holiday -- to hold protests. Amnesty International released a statement Monday ""urging the Egyptian authorities not to crack down"" on the planned nationwide demonstration. The banned Muslim Brotherhood, the biggest organized opposition to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's regime, had stated it would not have an official presence at Tuesday's protests, but some of its members ""have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention"" if they attend and protest, Amnesty International said. It was not clear whether opposition leader and Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei would attend the planned demonstrations. However, he posted statements supporting the effort on his Twitter account. He also issued a video statement released Monday on YouTube addressing police. ""I sympathize with you because sometimes you are asked to do things that you do not want to do,"" ElBaradei said. ""One day, I hope that you will regain your role as the protectors of the people; rather than protectors of ... fraud elections. I am sure that every one of you deep inside is looking forward to the day that his role will again be with the people and a part of them, rather than against them."" he added. Public sentiment against state security forces has grown recently with alleged videos of police brutality shown on the Internet. A recent report from Human Rights Watch said the problem is ""epidemic"" and ""in most cases, officials torture detainees to obtain information and coerce confessions, occasionally leading to death in custody."" Some other human rights groups, such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights, have drawn a comparison between Egypt and Tunisia under Ben Ali, in terms of the level of government corruption and police brutality. Adly, the Egyptian interior minister, dismissed any such comparisons, calling it ""propaganda"" that had been dismissed by politicians as ""intellectual immaturity."" But one woman, identified only as Nahla, who plans to attend the Tuesday protests, disagrees. She wrote in an online post, ""I hope the [Tunisia-style] revolution will be taught in history. And that Egyptians will learn in school later about the January 25th revolution.""","NEW: Tear gas fired at protesters in Cairo .

"Detectives are ""tightening up"" their case against Justin Bieber in his alleged egg attack on a neighbor, an investigator said Tuesday. The neighbor accused Bieber, 19, of tossing eggs over a fence and onto the mansion next door on January 9, causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. A dozen Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies raided Bieber's $6.5 million home in the exclusive Oaks community in Calabasas, California, two weeks ago, taking the security video system as evidence. A prosecutor reviewed the security video Monday and asked detectives to do more investigation before a decision is made about charging the pop star with felony vandalism, according to Lt. David Thompson. Could Justin Bieber be deported? Detectives are ""tightening up the case"" this week and will likely meet again with prosecutors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office next week, Thompson said.  The district attorney will then decide if a charge will be filed against Bieber. Bieber already faces criminal charges in Miami stemming from an early morning traffic stop last week. Although Breathalyzer tests suggest Bieber was not too drunk to legally drive when he was pulled over by Miami Beach police early Thursday, it could be two or three weeks before tests are back from the lab that should give a more accurate blood-alcohol reading and could tell if he was high on pot. Bieber blew .011 and .014 in two Breathalyzer tests given to him at the police station, according to a source with knowledge of the results. Florida's legal limit for drivers under the drinking age of 21 is .02. The police report said that Bieber failed a field sobriety test given to him at the police station. He admitted to drinking, using marijuana and taking prescription pills, police said. The Miami prosecutor said no date has been set yet for Bieber to return to court on the DUI, resisting arrest and expired license charges. We've seen this bad behavior before . Although Bieber was not charged with speeding, the arresting officer said it was his reason for stopping Bieber and testing his sobriety. The head of the exotic car rental company that owns the yellow Lamborghini Bieber was driving told CNN on Saturday that the GPS tracking system in the high-performance car indicated that Bieber never exceeded 55 mph in the 15 minutes before the stop. The Breathalyzer tests and the GPS information could help Bieber lawyer Roy Black in his defense of the singer. Bieber fled Miami late Friday, boarding a private jet for a flight to Panama City, Panama. Paparazzi photos showed Bieber strolling along a beach on the Pacific Ocean on Saturday, kicking a soccer ball while others kite surfed above the waves. Other photos showed his manager, Scooter Braun, and mentor Usher Raymond with Bieber at the Panama resort. His representatives have been silent about the criminal charges, declining to comment to CNN.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government will be hit with a class action lawsuit on behalf of 700 Guatemalans who were infected with syphilis unless it offers a way to settle claims before Friday, the plaintiffs' attorneys said. Law firms representing the victims said the United States intentionally infected the Guatemalans between 1946 and 1948 in an effort to study the effects of the disease. The complaint compares it to the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in Alabama. During the 40-year study that began in 1932, doctors observed how the disease progressed in about 400 poor African-Americans, who already had syphilis. The men were never told they had the disease and never treated for it. The test subjects received free medical testing, meals and burial insurance. ""We are hoping we can come up with a mutual agreement by Friday about what next steps should be in terms of a concrete remedy for the people that were impacted,"" Piper Hendricks, a litigation associate for Conrad and Scherer, said Tuesday. ""We were favorably impressed with how the administration denounced the studies and apologized last year; we hope we can come up with a settlement without actually having to go to court and litigate."" The Obama administration acknowledged the experiments in October. ""Although these events occurred more than 64 years ago, we are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a joint statement. ""We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices."" While the complaint mentions that there were at least 700 test subjects, it only lists seven plaintiffs -- all are either the direct victims of the testing or their legal heirs. ""We do expect more people to come forward, but the news is still making its way through Guatemala,"" said Hendricks, who acknowledged that many people may have passed away over the years. ""Some of our clients are living in rural regions and even if they have received news of what went on it's not easy to get in touch with someone to join the suit."" In a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday, attorneys Andres Alonso and Terrence Collingsworth ask that ""a claims process be set up through which aggrieved citizens of Guatemala, who have been adversely affected by this experiment,"" can receive a settlement outside the court system. The legal team says it will proceed with the litigation if it doesn't hear from the government by Friday.","Lawyers say about 700 Guatemalans were infected with syphilis .

"(CNN) -- The current round of fighting between the Israel Defense Forces and the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, in Gaza has been raging for over three weeks. Both sides have suffered casualties -- the numbers are much higher on the Palestinian side, as they always are. The Palestinian death toll has exceeded 1,000, while the Israelis have suffered fewer than 50. There are many reasons for the huge disparity, not the least of which are the facts that the ground combat is taking place in densely populated Gaza, and the effectiveness of the Israeli anti-rocket/missile system known as Iron Dome. Despite calls by the Egyptians, the United Nations and the U.S. secretary of state, fighting not only continues, but has escalated in the last few days. Israeli airstrikes, missile and artillery attacks, and naval gunfire have increased in tempo and lethality. The targets of the Israeli attacks have also expanded into areas normally considered to be off-limits, such as the al-Amin mosque in Gaza City, struck during the early morning hours of July 29. That same night saw attacks on the Hamas-run al-Aqsa radio station and homes of senior Hamas officials. This expands the target set beyond pure military targets and goes to the political structure of Hamas. The sole electrical power plant in Gaza was also in flames; there are conflicting reports as to the actual cause. The Israelis claim that a Hamas rocket malfunctioned and landed short in the facility, while the Palestinians claim it was Israeli tank fire. In any case, the infrastructure of Gaza is being severely damaged. So, how does this end? If one was to look at the previous conflicts in 2008 and 2012, there would be a United Nations Security Council resolution and a cease-fire with conditions accepted by both sides. The fighting stops, repairs to the infrastructure begin and everyone hopes that this cease-fire will hold longer than the last one. This time seems different. There seems to be less willingness on both sides to look for the ""usual"" way out of the armed confrontation. The Israelis continue their operations despite withering international criticism over the high number of civilian casualties in Gaza; they appear intent on achieving their stated goals of destroying the Hamas tunnels that threaten communities and kibbutzim inside Israel close to the Gaza frontier, and reducing, if not eliminating, Hamas' substantial rocket inventory. On the other side, Hamas is also committed to continue the fight. Despite the surprising effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome anti-rocket system, which has dramatically blunted Hamas' main threat to Israel, Hamas continues to fire rockets at Israeli cities. On the ground, the group appears to have adopted some of the tactics that Hezbollah used effectively against Israeli forces in southern Lebanon during the 2006 fighting. There are more ambushes, use of improvised explosive devices and tunnels to attack Israeli soldiers. Opinion: Five lessons of the Gaza war . There is another consideration influencing Hamas' decision to continue the fight. Hamas knows that it will be much harder to re-arm after the end of this round of hostilities. The main sources of its rocket arsenal and other weapons have been Iran and Syria -- Hamas' longest range rocket is the Syrian-made M-302, capable of reaching targets 100 miles away. The weapons traditionally are smuggled into Gaza via a series of tunnels on the Egyptian border, after being smuggled from ports in Sudan and transported across the Sinai peninsula. With the removal of the government of President Mohammed Morsy in Egypt, Hamas has lost a valuable ally and source of political support. The new Egyptian government of former defense chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has beefed up its military presence on the border with Gaza and dismantled many of the tunnels into Gaza. El-Sisi considers Hamas to be nothing more than a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he has outlawed in Egypt. Hamas cannot expect assistance from that quarter as it has in the past. At some point, the fighting will end. As I said, though, this time it is different. Rather than the result of United Nations-brokered cease-fire and agreement, in my assessment it will end when the Israelis have inflicted what they believe is enough damage to Hamas to render it militarily ineffective. This means the destruction of Hamas' rocket inventory and the destruction of all the tunnels Israeli forces can find. Only then will Israel quit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the Israeli people to expect a long fight in Gaza: ""We will not finish the mission, we will not finish the operation, without neutralizing the tunnels ... which have the sole purpose of destroying our citizens, killing our children."" I would take him at his word. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","In some ways, Gaza conflict fits pattern of earlier clashes, but this one is different .

"Canada's most valuable export? Oil. Its most problematic? Justin Bieber. You know it's going to be a strange week when the hashtag #DeportBieber. is trending on Twitter. Guess what? Nineteen-year-old singer and teen heartthrob Justin Bieber -- who was arrested this week in Miami Beach for street racing in a $250,000 Lamborghini while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, driving without a valid license, and resisting arrest -- is not a U.S. citizen. Rather, Bieber is a citizen of his native Canada. Lucky Canada. Bieber is in the United States on an O-1 work visa that was designed to retain foreigners with ""extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics."" What Bieber has is an extraordinary knack for getting into trouble. Far away from Miami, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is investigating whether Bieber was involved in an egging of his neighbor's home in a gated community in Calabasas, California. While other teenage celebrities might aspire to be crowned ""America's sweetheart,"" Bieber -- given his childish, narcissistic and self-destructive antics -- seems to be angling for a more dubious title: ""America's brat."" Bieber isn't known for doing smart things, but the one smart thing that Team Bieber did is what the rich and spoiled often do when they land in jail in South Florida. Bieber's manager hired Roy Black, the Miami-based celebrity defense lawyer who is as skilled in front of a television camera as in front of a jury. Black said this week that he hoped the case against Bieber would proceed ""as any other case would."" C'mon, Roy. Really? If this case had proceeded like any other -- or at least, like many others -- your client might be in Calgary by now. The immigration enforcement apparatus does not look favorably upon non-U.S. citizen foreigners who commit crimes and get arrested. You can have a green card or a visa that allows you to live in the United States legally while you work or study, and you can still get deported if you get crossways with the law. Think of it this way: The U.S. government grants permission to some people to stay in this country, and it can revoke it, too. It happens every day, especially here in the Southwest and along the U.S.-Mexico border, for crimes ranging from shoplifting to drunk driving to selling ice cream without a permit. Americans either don't hear about these cases, or they don't care because the person being removed from the country isn't rich and famous. Of course, Bieber hasn't been convicted of anything yet. In fact, according to published reports relying on a source close to the investigation, Bieber's blood-alcohol level was below 0.08% in two breath tests administered by authorities. The 0.08% mark is the legal limit for most drivers in Florida. For drivers under 21, the state has a lower threshold for proving one is intoxicated: 0.02%. A source told CNN that Bieber blew .011% and .014% in the two Breathalyzer tests. However, police say Bieber admitted to them that he had been drinking, using marijuana and taking prescription pills. The point is that, in many cases, when dealing with foreigners who find themselves in police custody, we wouldn't even have gotten this far. Again, back in the real world of law enforcement, there are police stations -- for instance, in Southern California -- that allow federal immigration agents to sit at a desk in the squad room. And when a police officer walks in with a suspect in handcuffs who looks like he might just be undocumented (read: ""Mexican""), the catch of the day gets passed on to the immigration agent before he is even fingerprinted. So there's no record of the transaction. And if the agent determines that the person in custody is in the country illegally, he takes possession and immediately transports him to a nearby Border Patrol substation to begin deportation proceedings. It's all very efficient, and journalists like me wouldn't even know it was happening if we didn't have helpful sources within police departments telling us that it's happening. In Bieber's case, he was not handed over to immigration agents and hustled out the back door of the police department to begin deportation proceedings. Instead, Bieber was released from jail after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a Miami judge, who set a ""standard"" $2,500 bond. Bieber has an estimated net worth of about $130 million. I bet that, right about now, many of those Mexican immigrants who were deported because they came to the attention of local police officers for a burned-out taillight, or for not making a complete stop at an intersection, are wishing that they had been a rich, white kid with marginal music ability and too much money. If so, things might have gone differently for them. Meanwhile, Congress seems to be getting ready to debate how to fix the immigration system. The major question will be what to do with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States. But along the way, lawmakers must also revisit and revamp the unfair O-1 work visa program. There is enough favoritism in the immigration system as it is. If people come from certain countries or have certain skills, they're more likely to get in. We don't need more of that brand of preferential treatment for singers, actors or ice skaters. Just like we don't need a certain Canadian import. If Bieber is convicted of the alleged crimes in South Florida, he should get what many other foreigners have already received for less serious infractions: a one-way ticket out of the country.","Justin Bieber was arrested for racing under the influence of drugs, alcohol .

"Poachers in search of ivory in northern Cameroon have slaughtered nearly 300 elephants for their tusks since mid-January, according to the country's minister of forestry and wildlife. Minister Ngole Philip Ngwese backed up a claim by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) that an armed gang of Sudanese poachers had killed the free-roaming elephants in the Bouba Ndjida National Park, on Cameroon's border with Chad. Park officials say many orphaned elephant calves have been spotted, and concerns are high the babies may soon die of hunger and thirst. One park official, Bouba Jadi, told CNN the deaths are worsening the situation for Cameroon's already threatened elephant populations. According to official estimates, there are between 1,000 and 5,000 elephants in Cameroon. Officials on a tour Monday saw at least 100 elephant carcasses. More carcasses are expected to be found in unexplored regions of the national park. A massive crackdown on poachers has been launched, according to officials in the west Central African nation. ""It was common for armed gangs of poachers to cross from Sudan during the dry season to kill elephants for their ivory. But this latest massacre is massive and has no comparison to those of the preceding years,"" IFAW official Celine Sissler Bienvenu told a local newspaper, The Voice. She added that the ivory is smuggled out of West and Central Africa for markets in Asia and Europe, and money from ivory sales funds arms purchases for use in regional conflicts, particularly ongoing unrest in Sudan and in the Central African Republic. Cameroon shares a porous border with Chad. Armed insurgents from Sudan and the Central African Republic seeking elephants frequently travel through Chad. Observers in Cameroon have been blaming the raids on poorly trained and ill-equipped park guards, who are pitted against professional gangs of poachers.","Poachers are killing the elephants for their tusks .

"Libyan authorities are trying to round up 1,200 inmates who spilled out of a Benghazi prison.

"A severed hand travels down a conveyor belt in a coal plant -- the pale, smooth skin of the hand half buried in shards of black coal. This macabre yet visually arresting scene sets the tone for ""Black Coal, Thin Ice,"" a Chinese arthouse thriller that has achieved the miraculous triple whammy of winning over critics, captivating audiences, and pleasing the notorious Film Bureau censorship panel. All this achieved without a hint of martial arts clichés or special effects, potentially signaling a new era of Chinese filmmaking. A classic detective story plot line drives the movie: when body parts start appearing in a northern Chinese town, an overweight  former cop who drinks too much turns vigilante and seeks out the serial killer. Along the way he falls in love with a woman connected to the murders. Top Berlin award . Directed by Diao Yinan, a relatively unknown name outside of the festival circuit, the film hit headlines in February when it won the Golden Bear, the top prize at the prestigious Berlin International Film Festival, as well as a Best Actor trophy for its lead, Liao Fan. It further raised eyebrows when China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, or SARFT, passed the film for domestic screening with just a handful of edits -- a rarity for a film based in politically sensitive themes of coal mining and depressed cops. The cherry landed on top when the film opened in China on March 19 to unexpectedly high box office earnings. State-run news agency Xinhua reported the movie raked in US$12.8 million in its first two weeks, becoming the current king of Chinese language cinema. ""I did think that we would do better than other Chinese award-winners, but I never thought we could possibly reach the RMB 100 million mark,"" says Diao, who was attending the Hong Kong International Film Festival. The success of ""Black Coal, Thin Ice"" is a possible game changer for the global film industry. If Chinese films continue to be so well-rounded, it could challenge the Hollywood-dominated global film scene. Changing tastes . The Chinese film market is the second largest in the world in terms of box office performance, and fast on it's way to surpassing the United States. According to a report by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), China's box office sales in 2013 achieved $3.6 billion and grew by 27%, compared to the 1% growth observed in the U.S. Many insiders predict it will surpass the U.S. in six years. SARFT announced an alarmingly rapid proliferation of cinemas in China in 2013, with an average of 13 new theaters being built per day. The country's first 7D cinema opened this week in the northern province of Shanxi, while in Qingdao, on the eastern coast, the Dalian Wanda Group is constructing what is says will be the world's biggest film and television hub. While there's no problem getting the Chinese audience to fill the seats in all those new cinemas, there is concern over raising the overall quality of the films that they will be watching. ""When I read reports by Hollywood reporters and critics, they always seem to look down on Chinese films,"" says Diao. ""I think they [Chinese officials] want to change this phenomenon. They don't want the masses to watch films with little cultural value. It can't all be like 'Where Are We Going, Dad?'"" The director was referring to a spin-off of a domestic hit reality TV show featuring celebrity dads and their kids. According to Xinhua, the movie took nearly $15 million on its first day in China, breaking the record for a single day's earnings for a Chinese language movie. Loosening the reigns, just a bit . Part of the strategy for changing the taste of movie-goers is to provide better films. This requires censors to loosen their grip and communicate with filmmakers better. Diao believes his film is setting a precedence for works that ride the balance of art and political correctness. He consciously made his film ""arthouse for the mainstream,"" injecting commercial elements to a gritty script. ""If you tell a good story, you can also honestly express your views and attitudes towards society, life, and humanity. It will just be in an indirect manner,"" he says. Originally inspired by American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne's short story, ""Wakefield,"" Diao reworked the screenplay over five years, incorporating a crowd-pleasing ""cops and robbers"" plot and film noir elements, citing directors John Huston, David Lynch, and the Coen Brothers as influences. ""It's about good people chasing after villains. We all loved these stories as kids and we still do as adults."" Apparently, even the censors loved it. Diao describes the censorship process as ""smooth"" with just ""five or six changes"" after a polite back and forth with members of SARFT. But it isn't smooth sailing for all. Leading Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke recently won Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival for ""A Touch of Sin,"" a work based on violent true-life events. The movie lingers in censorship limbo in China today. 'Optimistic' Diao argues that ""things are already much easier now than before"" and that filmmakers should be optimistic, as nurturing high quality cinema is a priority for a China concerned with gaining voice in the international cultural arena. ""All art and culture in the end is judged and determined by the market. Film will be the same. As the Chinese market grows, it will be able to compete with the U.S. for the right to speak. We want to speak through our films. We want to be accepted as equals,"" says Diao. ""We don't want to be liked just because we are being overtly politically critical, or just because we are showing a dark side of society. We have our own understanding of film. Film is about beauty. We want to conquer you with beauty and with our Eastern sensibilities.""","""Black Coal, Thin Ice"" reigns over domestic box office for Chinese language film .

"(CNN)Looking only at the historic, social and political facts, you will miss the spiritual phenomenon that enabled us to come together to change the South and the nation in 1965. MLK, LBJ, SNCC, SCLC, NAACP, churches, synagogues, universities, trade unions, United Nations, federal courts, FBI and even Congress came together in spite of historic conflicts and differences to create one of the greatest occasions in the history of our nation. That's miraculous. This complex story has evolved into a visual psalm of spiritual power that leads us to the truths of democracy that defy, but also reveal, the ultimate power that occasionally breaks into our lives and lifts us to new cultural heights. This is Selma the movement and ""Selma"" the movie. Oprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay, with a team of brilliant, but mostly little-known actors and artists, attempted to tell this story in Hollywood. They condensed years into minutes -- with great success. Very few of the personalities, their families or their institutions will like this phenomenal effort, for it does not give them the credit or the recognition to which they feel entitled.  We often get lost in the trees and miss the forest, and its life-saving grandeur and beauty. The opening scenes of ""Selma"" shocked me into a spiritual realm with the sudden explosion in the midst of four beautiful, laughing little girls in Sunday school at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.  That scene put me on an emotional roller coaster ride that reminded me that whatever success I have enjoyed was because of the sacrifice and suffering of others: from Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, to Jimmie Lee Jackson, James Reeb, and Viola Liuzzo. We are what we are because others risked and gave their lives to redeem our world from the evils of racism, war and poverty. Zelizer: The real story behind 'Selma' The movie ""Selma"" has been years in the making.  Many have tried. But most have given up because of the difficulties of accommodating so many constituencies, patents, property rights and the complex ego structure of our society.

With very little money.  And with only our faith in the creator as our source of power.  ""Selma"" is a cinematic tribute to the democratic vision that we can live together in freedom without violence. Fifty years later, the challenge is global as well as local. Now we must learn to address the economic crisis of unemployed poor and under-employed workers. Just as the answers 50 years ago revolved around voting, today's issues revolve around jobs, the economy, gender, culture, religion and healing. But now, we know that we can. Because of the miracle of Selma in 1965 and today as a film in 2015, we can bear witness and embrace the powerful belief that we shall overcome. ‎ .","Andrew Young: The movement for voting rights achieved a miracle, depicted in the film ""Selma""

"Washington (CNN)  -- Newt Gingrich first arrived on the national political scene when, a few years after being elected to the House, he pushed ethics violations charges against then-Speaker Jim Wright, who later resigned. Ethics complaints and a budget battle that forced a government shutdown, led to Gingrich's downfall after he had risen to the speaker's chair. On Thursday, Gingrich is expected to announce that he will explore a presidential run, typically the first step toward a national campaign. While Gingrich's quest to topple Wright helped him become the deputy leader of House Republicans in 1989, what solidified his place in American political history was his championing of the 1994 Contract With America, a blueprint for changes the GOP pledged it would bring to Congress if it gained control of the House. The contract required that all laws the public had to abide by also applied to Congress, limited the terms of committee chairmen and required a three-fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase. The contract helped propel the GOP to its first majority in the House in 40 years and got Gingrich, a representative from Georgia, elected speaker. Gingrich coverage on the CNN Political Ticker . ""Those of us who ended up in the majority stood on these steps and signed a contract ... aimed at restoring the faith and trust of the American people in their government,"" Gingrich said as he was sworn in as speaker in January 1995. Soon Gingrich was battling the Clinton White House as congressional Republicans pushed government cuts to help balance the budget. Both sides dug in and there were two government shutdowns. Gingrich and congressional Republicans came out the political losers. ""It's very difficult to work with a president who seems to be primarily driven by his political advisers to engage in public relations stunts,"" Gingrich said of Clinton in early November 1995, a few weeks before the first shutdown. Democrats ridiculed Gingrich for allowing hurt feelings over a perceived slight by Clinton to influence his stance in the budget negotiations. Gingrich said he had felt snubbed by Clinton and his staff when he traveled with the president to Israel for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral. Gingrich had to use Air Force One's back stairs for the trip. He said Clinton's behavior had caused him to toughen his stand during initial budget discussions. The incident was later immortalized by a New York Daily News cartoon titled ""Cry-Baby."" In a Washington Post op-ed last weekend, Gingrich dismissed suggestions the shutdowns were that bad for his party. ""Those who claim that the shutdown was politically disastrous for Republicans ignore the fact that our House seat losses in 1996 were in the single digits,"" Gingrich wrote. ""Moreover, it was the first time in 68 years that Republicans were re-elected to a House majority and the first time that had ever happened with a Democrat winning the presidency."" In 1998, Gingrich lashed out at the Clinton White House's handling of the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky affair, calling it a ""systematic, deliberate, obstruction of justice."" Later it was revealed that Gingrich was having an extramarital affair with a congressional staffer. Gingrich had to confront numerous ethics complaints brought by Democrats. He voluntarily turned in a $4.5 million book advance after critics questioned its appropriateness. In 1997 he agreed to pay $300,000 to the House to reimburse the cost of an ethics investigation into whether he used tax-exempt funds to promote Republican causes. He was not found guilty of those charges. He was reprimanded by the House for giving what was considered misleading information. Republicans kept control of the House for a third consecutive term in the 1998 elections, but won fewer seats than expected. Gingrich resigned as speaker and left Congress the next year. Over the next decade, Gingrich mounted a comeback, expounding on the lecture circuit on his numerous ideas about how to reform government and society -- ranging from creating a new Social Security system based on what one contributes to completely revamping the country's energy policy to replacing the Environmental Protection Agency with a new Environmental Solutions Agency. He also formed a successful think tank, called American Solutions for Winning the Future, which he used to help develop and communicate his ideas. His visibility was elevated when he joined Fox News as a contributor, which gave him a national platform to comment on the news and promote a number of books he has written on subjects ranging from the American political scene to Ronald Reagan. Fox announced on Wednesday that it was suspending the contracts of Gingrich and a fellow contributor, Republican former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, until they make decisions about running for president. Gingrich is also a prolific fundraiser. American Solutions raised more than $3.8 million between October and the end of December 2010 and almost $14 million over the entire year. The American Solutions political action committee raised an additional $425,000 from October through December. With those numbers, Gingrich outpaced his potential 2012 rivals in money brought in. Republican consultants not affiliated with any prospective campaign said they believe Gingrich as a presidential candidate offers positives as well as negatives. ""He is an idea factory. Republican voters love him,"" GOP consultant Ron Bonjean said. ""They have watched him on TV and watched his think tank produce on an almost weekly basis. ""The cons are that he has a political record. He has been a career politician in Washington and a House speaker who left under controversial circumstances and that could weigh on voters' minds."" Some Republican consultants also said his personal life, with two divorces, will complicate any potential run because that will not be popular with some social conservatives who are a key voting bloc in key early voting states.","Gingrich used ethics issues to bring down his foes .
But ethics problems also helped bring down Gingrich .

"Ethics troubles complicated New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's chances of becoming Mitt Romney's running mate last year, The New York Times reports is in an upcoming chronicle of the 2012 presidential campaign. The Times reported that too many questions remained after Christie completed the vetting process and Romney had lingering concerns. The details come four days before New Jersey voters head to the polls to determine if Christie gets a second term. During a campaign stop Friday, he dismissed the report and told CNN that the authors are ""just trying to sell books."" Christie's challenges were first reported Thursday night by Times national political correspondent Johnathan Martin and based on details of the book, ""Double Down: Game Change 2012."" The highly anticipated book about the presidential election by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, is expected to be a juicy tell-all about the inner-workings of the presidential campaign. Those concerns included a Justice Department investigation of Christie's expenditures while he was a U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. A 2010 report by the department's Inspector General concluded Christie â€” among five top prosecutors investigated -- was the ""the U.S. attorney who most often exceeded the government (travel expense) rate without adequate justification."" He also offered ""insufficient, inaccurate or no justification"" for most of those costs, and refused to meet personally with investigators about the discrepancies. Christie was not identified by name in the government report, but government sources have said he was ""U.S. Attorney C,"" CNN confirmed. Romney adviser Beth Myers, who ran Romney's vice presidential search committee, told CNN that ""Governor Christie complied fully with the Romney campaign's request for documents in a timely manner, including a complete medical report from his internist and cardiologist."" Romney ultimately chose Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate. Biden vs. Clinton . President Barack Obama's closest advisers may have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket, but White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that it was never a remote possibility. ""Campaigns and pollsters test a lot of things,"" he told reporters at the daily White House briefing. ""What I can tell you without a doubt  is that the President never considered that and if anyone brought that to him, he would have laughed it out of the room, would never take it seriously."" Carney earlier told CNN's ""New Day"" that he knew ""for a fact"" Obama never considered it, later saying the idea was never brought to him. He answered affirmatively when asked if Obama thought Biden would be a strong chief executive, saying that he had been an asset to the President in two campaigns and throughout the administration. ""Sure. I think the President picked Joe Biden as his running mate for the right reason, which is, if necessary, the vice president could be president. That's the first item on your checklist when you're picking your running mate,"" Carney said at the White House. Asked about sizing up the potential Republican presidential field, Carney replied, ""I think they all ought to run. It would be awesome."" Bill Daley, who was then Obama's chief of staff, said the swap wasn't necessary. No one ""thought that that was a good idea or needed to be done or should be done,"" Daley said on ""CBS This Morning."" The Times obtained a copy of the book and reported that the President's top aides conducted ""extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011"" to gauge whether dumping Biden could help bolster Obama's waning re-election hopes. The book says Daley spearheaded the effort, despite their ""close personal rapport,"" before ultimately deciding against the move when data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket wouldn't ""materially improve Obama's odds."" Daley pushed back on the notion. ""Not for a moment was there a serious discussion or a belief that Joe Biden should be replaced, period,"" said Daley, a CBS contributor. A difficult political year . Like Carney said, Daley admitted that it was something he considered and that polling and research were done to explore the possibility because it was his job to ""look outside the box."" ""But in 2011,"" Daley said, ""it was a very difficult political year, and so my sense was we ought to look at everything here because this is a very -- it was a very difficult period, politically."" Polls conducted by CNN at the time showed that the President was struggling politically a year out from Election Day 2012. In the late summer and fall of 2011, Obama's approval ratings hovered around 45%, a 10-point drop from January of that year. There was much speculation over whether Biden would be on a second-term ticket in late 2011 and early 2012. Wolf Blitzer wrote on CNN.com in October 2011 that White House sources told him that the President was ""very high"" on Biden and ""deeply appreciates his advice."" He said he asked Clinton, then Secretary of State, if it was something she would consider but she said, ""No."" Obama's former deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, told CNN's Erin Burnett in January 2012, ""Even privately, President Obama would tell you that one of the best decisions he's ever made in politics was putting Vice President Biden on his ticket."" ""He's not leaving the ticket,"" Burton added. According to Jonathan Martin, the Times' national political correspondent, the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the White House, namely Daley, to measure what effect swapping Clinton for Biden would have on the polls. The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office. Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers -- including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew the change was under consideration. Messina, Plouffe and Axelrod took to Twitter to push back on the report. Plouffe denied the White House or the campaign ever contemplated the swap. ""Never any consideration of (Biden-for-Clinton) switch,"" Plouffe wrote in a tweet. The move was ""not ever entertained by the only person who mattered. Or most of us. Back to Halloween,"" he added. Axelrod tweeted: ""VP swap never in play. Biden's taken on many tough assignments. He's been loyal friend and wise counselor. POTUS lucky to have him,"" Axelrod wrote Friday. And Messina said: ""Let me be clear: VP-HRC switch never considered by POTUS or anyone who mattered in the campaign. #sillyseason"" A significant investment . But Martin pointed out that it was, in fact, considered. Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls. ""Campaigns don't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something,"" he said on CNN's ""AC360."" He said on the program that he asked Daley whether his then-boss knew about the potential shuffle. While Daley said he doesn't think the President ""was aware"" of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it's ""possible"" Obama knew. Martin added that ""Double Down"" does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached Obama's desk. As to whether Clinton knew, Daley said on CBS that if she did know, she ""didn't find out from me.""","Concerns included investigation of Christie's travel expenditures while U.S. attorney.

"Donna Summer defined the disco era. Her brazenly sexual hits ""Love To Love You Baby"" and ""I Feel Love"" horrified some and delighted many more when they came out. They also helped to propel disco into a national phenomenon.  Even now, the sound of her voice -- controlled yet passionate -- summons up the hedonistic, willful spirit of the late 1970s. Summer died from cancer Thursday at 63. Her passing offers an opportunity to reconsider her musical contributions and the legacy of disco. News: The legacy of America's disco queen is lasting . But she deserves more than nostalgic praise, because her records with producer Giorgio Moroder have had a lasting effect on pop music. Listen to Lady Gaga's  ""Born This Way,"" for starters.  Not only does the disco-inflected rhythm evoke Summer's dance tunes, but as a gay-pride anthem, it recalls the roiling, joyful setting in which Donna Summer's music first found its audience. Disco originated in the 1970s New York club scene, and it was Summer's ""Love To Love You Baby"" and then the Bee Gees' ""Saturday Night Fever"" that catapulted it onto the national stage. In ""Love To Love You Baby,"" a strong-voiced woman gives herself over to pure pleasure.  This feeling of abandon reflected the spirit of the emerging gay liberation movement. Overheard on CNN: Dim all the lights; this 'last dance' goes out to Donna Summer . Back then, the music and its culture was huge. But to be honest, these days Donna Summer -- and the disco craze she embodied -- sometimes get a bum rap. Disco is a kind of guilty pleasure for people of a certain age, a slightly embarrassing hangover from the simultaneously wild and innocent days of their youth. But they -- we -- have nothing to be ashamed of, and neither does Donna Summer. Because underneath the flashy exterior and dated trappings of the best disco records lurks true heart and soul. And disco records don't get better than the ones Donna Summer made with Moroder. Listen to a playlist of Donna Summer's greatest hits . ""Love To Love You Baby,"" a Top 10 hit in 1976, largely consists of vocal moans and sighs over an orchestrated rhythm track. ""At first it was startling, almost embarrassing -- even in this age of rampant pornography,"" wrote critic Albert Goldman in 1978.  And Summer's sexy album covers fed into the disco diva persona. But she was no moonlighting fashion model. Born in Boston, she had performed in European productions of ""Godspell"" and ""Hair"" before she met Moroder in Germany. Moroder crafted a sleek musical background for her creamy vocals, cushioned by strings, synthesizers and a fluid dance beat. When the tingling ""I Feel Love"" hit the Top 10 in 1977, her sound became almost purely electronic. Perhaps this is the moment when the machines began to take over the music business. In reality, Donna Summer never conformed to the stereotype of disco singer as producer's plaything, despite Moroder's commanding presence. She was ambitious, releasing concept albums such as ""A Love Trilogy"" and ""Four Seasons of Love"" and an epic disco-fied version of ""Macarthur Park,"" by 1960s songwriter Jimmy Webb. And at the end of the 1970s, Summer came into her own. The double album ""Bad Girls"" was her magnum opus. Even disco-hating rock fans were taken aback. ""Bad Girls"" added soaring lead guitar lines and more varied songwriting to the mix. The singles ""Bad Girls"" and ""Hot Stuff"" took this disco-rock fusion to the top of the pop charts, while the slow-dance ""Dim All the Lights"" revealed more of Donna Summer's personality than her earlier hits. Later in the '70s, Summer became a born-again Christian and began to distance herself ever so slightly from her sexy image.  In the 1980s, America moved on from disco, and so did Summer. She dabbled in Las Vegas schmaltz, made an ambitious album with Quincy Jones and came bouncing back with the assertive ""She Works Hard for the Money"" at the dawn of the MTV era. She continued to record comeback albums well into the 1990s, but over the past decade or so, the new music came less frequently. She performed the occasional greatest hits tours after the disco craze had long since retreated.  And her music gained hipster cachet, even fully divorced from the cultural flash of its time. Indeed, every synth-pop group from Depeche Mode on down owes Donna Summer a big thank you, if not a royalty check, for the influence and innovation of ""I Feel Love."" ""Generally I don't think there is too much art involved in what I do,"" said Moroder in 1978 at the peak of his career. ""But I do know that I achieved something specially different with 'Love To Love You Baby' and 'I Feel Love.' These songs will endure.""","Mark Coleman: Donna Summer, who died Thursday, defined the disco era of the '70s .

"(CNN) -- He has beheaded again. The tall, masked British man with the London accent, working with ISIS. His first two victims were American journalists. His third was a fellow citizen, British aid worker David Haines. British Prime Minister David Cameron hastily assembled a meeting of his top national security advisers in the early hours of Sunday morning to discuss what can be done. According to British officials, Cameron knows the identity of the British executioner. ISIS executes David Haines, Cameron vows justice . He also knows that the executioner has already killed two citizens of his country's closest ally and he knows that the executioner holds at least two other American citizens. Cameron knows that the executioner holds other hostages from additional Western countries and that he is part of a larger group of British hostage-takers working for ISIS, nicknamed ""the Beatles"" by their captives. And he knows that the lives of the remaining hostages are in grave danger. It is a real crisis for Cameron, and it underlines a sobering fact: British citizens have volunteered to go to Syria to fight at 25 times the rate that Americans have done so, when adjusted for population size. Some 500 British citizens have traveled to Syria to fight, as have 100 Americans. The population of the United Kingdom is about a fifth of that of the States. A British government assessment by the Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism provided to CNN shows that the British have already arrested 69 people this year for ""Syria related terrorist offences"" that include terrorist financing, preparing an act of terrorism, and attending a terrorist training camp. In 2013, 25 people were arrested in the UK on similar charges, bringing the total number of arrests to 94, according to the British government assessment. By contrast, only eight have been arrested for similar Syria-related terrorist crimes in the States. ISIS execution videos strikingly similar . The war in Syria is attracting British fighters from all kinds of ethnic backgrounds, not just those of Syrian descent. A British official told CNN that the vast majority of British fighters going to Syria do not have any real links to the country other than a desire to fight in a holy war against the Bashar al-Assad regime. Alarmed by the threat posed by its citizens fighting in Syria, the British government has already refused to issue or has cancelled 23 passports and has also revoked the citizenship of eight British citizens, according to the Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism. The British agency also underlines the threat posed by other European citizens who have traveled to Syria, who can freely travel around the European Union, including the UK, and who can also travel to the States without visas as they are from so-called ""visa waiver"" countries. Statement from the family of David Haines . According to the British government, 700 fighters have traveled to Syria from France; 400 from Germany; between 300 and 500 from Belgium; 130 from the Netherlands; over 100 from Denmark; 100 from Austria; 80 from Sweden; and between 50 and 100 from Spain. The British government also estimates that 100 Canadians have left Canada to ""support or train with terrorist movements abroad. The majority of these are likely to be in Syria."" And it estimates that there are 60 Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq and about 100 Australian ""facilitators"" helping to make this possible in Australia. This brings the total number of Westerners who have fought in Syria to between 2,620 and 2,870, according to the British Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism assessment obtained by CNN, which is likely the most authoritative estimate yet. Despite the fact that the British government has identified the executioner of the two American journalists and of David Haines, it is not making his name public ""for operational reasons."" That's because the only likely hope for the remaining hostages is some kind of rescue operation similar to the one that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command mounted on July 4, which didn't achieve its purpose because the prisoners had been recently moved from the location where they were being held in Syria. A rescue operation is a long shot, but at this point it may be the only real chance of saving the lives of the remaining hostages. David Cameron knows this -- and so does President Barack Obama.","ISIS executioner, tall man with London accent, has beheaded a third man, a UK aid worker .

"In an unusual step, a U.S. congressman is proposing a two-year ban on all new federal legislation regulating the Internet. Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican from California who has been an advocate for Internet freedoms, has posted online a draft of his legislation, the Internet American Moratorium Act of 2012. The bill would ""create a two-year moratorium on any new laws, rules or regulations governing the Internet."" Issa first posted the complete text of the bill Monday on Project Madison, the nickname for a crowdsourcing platform that allows citizens to amend individual passages of legislation by adding or striking language. On Tuesday, he posted a link to the bill on Reddit, the social news site, where users quickly voted it to the top. ""Together, we can make Washington take a break from messing w/ the Internet,"" Issa said on Reddit, where he also invited users to suggest changes to the proposed bill. He said he will begin taking questions about it from Reddit users Wednesday morning. Issa is one of the more tech-fluent members of Congress and was an outspoken critic of the Stop Online Piracy Act, which would have penalized websites that host pirated content. That bill died this year amid near-unanimous opposition from the technology industry. It was not immediately clear whether Issa's moratorium would apply to his own Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act, which would seek to protect U.S. copyrights and trademarks from infringement by foreign websites. Initial reaction on Reddit to his proposed moratorium was mixed. Some users were confused about what point Issa was trying to make, while others saw the move as a stunt. ""I have a problem with legislation that preemptively ties your hands for years at a time. You can't know what the internet or society will look like in six months, let alone two years, and making it harder to respond to emerging threats or opportunities is an abdication of your responsibilities as a member of Congress,"" wrote one Reddit user. ""This just seems to me to be more cheap political theater, along the lines of Grover Norquist's 'We will never ever ever raise taxes for any reason' pledge."" ""The answer is NOT to ban new regulation. We need regulation,"" another said. ""But, I don't believe ANYBODY in Congress has the vocabulary, is intelligent in knowing how the internet or computers work, or has the foresight to put current trends and future technologies together in a context to create those new regulation that protect the internet and it's users/consumers."" Issa's Reddit post had drawn more than 2,000 comments by early Wednesday. Leslie Horn, writing for Gizmodo, also dismissed Issa's idea. ""Open internet? That's a good thing. But a law that keeps congress from governing? That's not a good thing -- the internet is a big place, and the language of this law is very broad,"" she wrote. ""As it stands now, IAMA is just a discussion draft, meaning it will be a very long time before it's even close to a vote. And while we're for an open internet, a blanket ban is a bad idea. Let's think about this one a little more, Rep. Issa."" When asked why the congressman introduced the bill, a spokesman for Issa told CNN, ""After SOPA and PIPA (the Senate's similar Protect Intellectual Property Act), it became very clear that we needed a cooling-off period to figure out a better way to create policy that impacts Internet users, job creators and all Americans."" The spokesman, who asked not to be named, declined further comment Tuesday.","Rep. Darrell Issa proposes halt to federal Web regulations .

"Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock believes that rapes resulting in pregnancy are ""something that God intends to happen."" Do you? It's a relevant question as we enter the last two weeks of this election, because Mourdock's comments are not isolated. The statement comes from the same rigid ideology behind conservative Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's musings in   August, when he said women's bodies have the ability to ""shut down"" pregnancies that result from what he called ""legitimate rape."" Mourdock and Akin were both trying to explain their determination to outlaw abortion even in cases of rape and incest, a position consistent with the Republican Party platform, which calls for a constitutional ban on abortion. Mitt Romney and some other leading Republicans repudiated Akin's comment.  But as I pointed out in a CNN column at the time,  the problem seemed to lie with the politics and optics rather than  underlying policy. Republicans are desperately trying to close the gender gap with women, and one way to do it is to insist that this election is only about economic issues.  But many conservative candidates for Senate harbor deep-seated social conservative views, an absolute opposition to abortion among them.  It's a position that vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan has long held. Most Americans believe that abortion should be ""safe, legal and rare.""  And a stunning Gallup Poll taken earlier this month in 12 swing states found that 39% of women who are registered voters said that abortion was the most important issue for women in this election.  With the Supreme Court likely one vote away from overturning Roe v. Wade -- a goal that Mitt Romney has reaffirmed on the campaign trail -- this issue is real and relevant. That's why Mourdock's centrist Democrat Senate opponent Joe Donnelly said, ""The God I believe in and the God I know most Hoosiers believe in does not intend for rape to happen — ever. ... What Mr. Mourdock said is shocking, and it is stunning that he would be so disrespectful to survivors of rape."" The case against electing a right-wing ideologue like Richard Mourdock to the Senate goes deeper than social issues.  When Mourdock took on the senior Senate statesman Dick Lugar in a Republican primary with tea party support, he specifically attacked Lugar's record of bipartisan problem-solving, saying: ""The time for collegiality is past ... it's time for confrontation."" That's the kind of change a Tea-vaneglist  candidate like Mourdock represents for the U.S. Senate, the Republican Party and the nation -- more hyper-partisan fighting, more absolutism and more religion influencing public policy.  There's nothing libertarian about government forcing a woman to carry her rapist's baby to term. Let's be clear -- Mourdock's attempt to square his religious beliefs with his public policy beliefs is what led to the tortured statement.   But what Mourdock said was not a mistake or a misstatement.  It's what he truly believes. Combined with his commitment to be an obstructionist and absolutist in the Senate, instead of a bipartisan problem-solver, it presents a clear choice with national implications because he's the only Senate candidate running for whom Mitt Romney took the time to cut a TV ad. Indiana voters will get to decide if Mourdock's comments are consistent with their common sense approach to politics and problem-solving.  Voters across the nation will need to decide whether they want to empower his extreme vision of politics in Washington over the next four years.","GOP's  Mourdock says ""God intends"" any pregnancies that come from rape .

"Cory Monteith, who played heart throb Finn Hudson in the Fox hit ""Glee,"" was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room on Saturday, police said. He was 31. Police said the cause of death was not immediately apparent, but they ruled out foul play. Medical examiners will conduct an autopsy on Monday. Monteith's body was discovered by staff members at the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel after he missed his checkout time, acting Chief Constable Doug LePard told reporters. Monteith apparently had several people over to his room at one point Friday night, but LePard said Monteith, who had checked in July 6, was seen on hotel surveillance video returning to his room in the early morning hours by himself. Lea Michele silent on 'devastating' news of Monteith's death . The glue of 'Glee' Adam Shankman, who directed an episode for each of the past three seasons, told CNN's Poppy Harlow that he had talked to Monteith on Saturday morning. The actor said he wanted to come down to California to Jet Ski. Shankman said Monteith was the glue of ""Glee."" He was always welcoming, whether it was to a guest director or a new cast member, Shankman said. The actor knew all of his lines when filming began each time and would congratulate his fellow cast members when he thought they did well. ""He showed up every day and he was a delight,"" Shankman said. In his own words . 'My heart is broken' One of his castmates on ""Glee,"" Mark Salling, tweeted a simple ""no"" after police held their news conference. Celebrities react to Monteith's death .

My heart is with his family and our whole Glee family! I love you all!"" Share your memories of Monteith . Offscreen, Monteith was dating co-star Lea Michele. He was madly in love with her, Shankman said. ""He felt like it had renewed his spirit."" Reps for the actress asked Sunday ""that everyone kindly respect Lea's privacy during this devastating time."" Struggles with substance abuse . Monteith spent time in rehab this year, checking into a drug addiction treatment facility in late March. He had been frank about his struggles with substance abuse, telling Parade magazine in 2011 that he began using drugs at 13, and by 19 went into rehab after his mother and friends intervened. ""I had several interactions with him yesterday where he said that he was doing amazing,"" Shankman said. ""He even said I am feeling fantastic. I'm like everybody else, really devastated and confused by what happened."" Remembering Monteith as Finn on 'Glee' Awards for show . Monteith had been on the musical comedy show since it began in 2009. On the show, Monteith played the dim quarterback of the football team at the Ohio high school who is forced to join the glee club. After graduation, he comes back to town and helps direct a musical at the school. In 2011, he won a Teen Choice Award for top actor in a comedy. The show's cast won a Screen Actors Guild Award for an ensemble in a comedy the previous year. He was in three projects that are in post-production, according to the Internet Movie Database.

"Afghans have finished casting their ballots to pick a president in a runoff election between former Cabinet ministers. Saturday's runoff between former Foreign Affairs Minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani went on despite incidents of violence: Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi said 10 Afghan soldiers, 14 civilians and 19 insurgents were killed in a day that saw nearly 150 attacks throughout the country.  Salangi said more than 60 Afghan troops and 41 civilians were injured in those attacks, as were 10 insurgents. Insurgents cut off the inked fingers of 11 voters, mostly of whom were elderly men returning home from a polling station in Herat province, according to Samiullah Qatra, the police chief of Western Herat province. The injured men were taken to a hospital, Salangi tweeted. Citizens have their fingers inked to show that they have voted. Even though the day was marked by violence, the International Security Assistance Force still lauded the election as a security success. ""ISAF commends the Afghan National Security Forces, who essentially conducted non-stop security operations following the April 5th elections,"" said an ISAF news release. ""The ANSF led all aspects of security, securing approximately 6,200 polling centers across the country. This is a historic accomplishment."" Third vote since Taliban's fall . The Obama administration praised the ""historic presidential election"" on Saturday. ""These elections are a significant step forward on Afghanistan's democratic path, and the courage and resolve of the Afghan people to make their voices heard is a testament to the importance of these elections to securing Afghanistan's future,"" read a statement from White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.  ""As the President said when he reaffirmed our continuing commitment to Afghanistan beyond 2014, while the future of Afghanistan must be decided by Afghans, the United States will support the Afghan people as they continue the hard work of building a democracy."" This is the third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, and it's set to be the first democratic transfer of power in the fragile, war-torn country. After casting his own ballot, President Hamid Karzai gave a short speech urging other voters to head to polling stations, the presidential palace said. Their participation would help lead to ""stability and a prosperous life"" in the country, he said. ""In reality, today is the day that Afghanistan is stepping from a transition period to stability, development and peace,"" he said. ""Today is your day to come out and save your soil from being ruined, bring stability to your country, brighten its future, choose your president and found the future of children of this soil by your vote."" Karzai opponent was top vote getter in first round . Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power. Although he was once an ally of Karzai, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in recent years become an opponent. He challenged Karzai in the 2009 election but dropped out after the first round to protest what he said was large-scale voting fraud. Ghani is a former academic and U.S. citizen who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He worked as an adviser to Karzai and as finance minister in his Cabinet. In the general election on April 5, Abdullah secured 45% of the vote, while Ghani got 31.6%. A candidate needs to receive more than 50% of the votes to win the first round and avoid a runoff. Vote counting has already started in some provinces, including northern Balkh and southern Kandahar, Afghan election officials said. Some 7 million turned out to vote in the April 5 election, but there was no immediate information available about Saturday's turnout. The results will be announced on July 22, the election commission said.","Insurgents cut off inked fingers of 11 voters in Herat province .

"(CNN) -- The downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine last week, most likely after being struck with a missile fired by pro-Russian rebel forces, was followed this week by the rebels' shoot-down of two Su-25 attack aircraft deployed by the Ukrainian Air Force. These incidents reflect a typical pattern in insurgencies and counterinsurgency operations. Air power is often crucial in fighting insurgents, as it has been recently in Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force has made up for the poor performance of Ukrainian ground units by driving rebel forces into retreat. The Su-25 ground-attack planes that were shot down this week were part of a renewed Ukrainian air offensive against rebel positions. Because governments fighting insurgencies often enjoy a monopoly or major advantage in air power, rebel fighters must try to offset this advantage by using surface-to-air missiles, or SAMs, and other air-defense weapons. That is precisely what has been happening recently in Ukraine, where pro-Russian rebels have shot down at least a dozen Ukrainian military aircraft over the past few months. The downing of MH17 was apparently a tragic mistake, not a deliberate attack on a passenger airliner flying at high altitude. The pro-Russian rebels evidently believed the target was a large military transport aircraft, only to realize afterward that they had committed a terrible blunder. Who are Ukraine's pro-Russia rebels? But even if the downing of the airliner had been deliberate, it would not have been unprecedented. Indeed, on numerous occasions, insurgents armed by Moscow have deliberately shot down civilian planes. In September 1978, guerrillas from the Zimbabwean People's Revolutionary Army shot down an Air Rhodesia passenger airliner using a Soviet-supplied SA-7 shoulder-fired SAM. Dozens were killed in the crash, but 56 passengers survived. The guerrillas methodically hunted down the survivors and killed them (though a small number evaded death by hiding). Five months later, in February 1979, Zimbabwean guerrillas once again used a Soviet-supplied SA-7 to shoot down an Air Rhodesia passenger aircraft. All the passengers and crew died in the crash. In December 1988, Polisario Front guerrillas in Morocco used Soviet-supplied missiles to attack two U.S. DC-7 civilian aircraft that were spreading insecticide against a locust infestation. One of the planes crashed, killing all five Americans on board. After the Soviet Union broke apart, the new government in Moscow continued to arm and train insurgent forces, focusing on other former Soviet republics. On three consecutive days in September 1993, Russian-backed separatist guerrillas in the Abkhazian region of Georgia deliberately attacked Transair Georgian Airways passenger flights, using Russian-supplied shoulder-held SA-7s against two of them in flight and artillery against the third during boarding. A total of 136 people were killed in the three incidents. This record of Soviet and Russian support for insurgents who target civilian aircraft is important to bear in mind when judging the latest crisis over Ukraine. In all these earlier instances from the 1970s through the 1990s, Moscow-backed guerrillas deliberately attacked civilian planes. By contrast, in last week's downing of MH17, the likelihood is that the rebels only targeted the passenger aircraft because they thought it was a military plane. No one has yet apologized for the incident, and the pro-Russian forces' handling of the crash site has been despicable, but the downing was not akin to the deliberate attacks that occurred in earlier years. Many flights soar over conflict zones . Many observers have depicted events in Ukraine, including the MH17 tragedy, as reflecting something peculiar about Russian foreign policy under President Vladimir Putin. But as the 1993 attacks by Abkhazian fighters indicate, Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin often dealt with Russia's neighbors in a similar manner, seeing them as little more than vassal states. Under both Yeltsin and Putin, Russia has bullied, intimidated, destabilized and violated the sovereignty of its neighbors, especially Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, whenever they have been led by rulers the Russian authorities dislike. Since 1992, Russia has consistently supported the entrenchment of authoritarian regimes in neighboring states and opposed upheavals and popular unrest directed against authoritarian rulers. The historical record of Russia's domineering policy toward other former Soviet republics has often been disregarded in the recent flurry of commentary about Ukraine and MH17. One observer, writing last week on Forbes.com, declared that the MH17 disaster marked ""the first case of rebels, supplied by a major power with surface-to-air missiles, bringing down a passenger plane."" That statement is absurd and reflects an underlying ignorance of the long record of Russia's imperious dealings with its neighbors. When thinking about where things might head now in Ukraine, we need to separate entrenched patterns from what is truly distinctive. Many observers get caught up with the daily twists and turns and fail to consider relevant historical precedents. In each case in the past when Moscow-backed guerrillas deliberately attacked civilian aircraft, the incidents had no lasting impact on the conflicts and did not induce the Kremlin to back down. After the September 1993 attacks that destroyed three Georgian passenger planes, Yeltsin not only maintained his staunch support of the Abkhazian separatists but also deployed thousands of Russian troops in Abkhazia to deter the Georgian government from trying to reclaim it. Over the past week many have predicted that MH17 will be a ""game-changer"" and might even lead to the unraveling of Putin's regime. The historical record gives us little reason to be confident about such optimistic prognoses.

"It has long been said that in war, ""truth is the first casualty."" It is generally accepted, however, that the United States, the world's leading democracy, should try to make truth-telling a common practice when it goes to war. When Gen. David Petraeus was U.S. commander in Afghanistan in 2010 he issued guidance to his troops, one of the key points of which was to ""be first with the truth."" The guidance explained, ""Avoid spinning, and don't try to 'dress up' an ugly situation. Acknowledge setbacks and failures, including civilian casualties, and then state how we'll respond and what we've learned."" Yet, in Yemen where the U.S. has been fighting a small, undeclared war for the past four years, we have now arrived at the ironic point where America's main enemy there, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is doing a better job of truth telling than the U.S. In a video message released on Sunday, a leader of al Qaeda in Yemen apologized for an attack on a hospital in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa earlier this month in which civilians were killed. According to the al Qaeda leader, the attackers were targeting the Yemeni Ministry of Defense, but one fighter made a mistake and attacked a hospital inside the defense ministry: ""We confess to this mistake and fault. We offer our apologies and condolences to the families of the victims,"" said the al Qaeda leader. While al Qaeda has publicly -- and, no doubt, self-servingly -- apologized for killing civilians at the Yemeni hospital during the attack in Sanaa on December 5, at the same time American officials have said nothing publicly about a U.S. drone strike that took place a week later on a suspected convoy of militants in western Yemen on December 12. The target of this strike turned out to be a wedding party and at least a half dozen civilians are reliably reported to have died. This gets to a key problem of the secretive American drone program. Its clandestine and unaccountable nature means that when the U.S. does make a mistake, as it inevitably will, instead of apologizing and making some kind of compensation to the civilian victims of a botched strike -- a common practice when the U.S. military inadvertently kills civilians in wartime -- American officials instead say ... nothing. Or worse, they make claims that the program is somehow perfect and never kills civilians as Obama's then top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, improbably claimed of the drone program in June 2011 when he said that for almost a year, ""there hasn't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities we've been able to develop."" Brennan is now the CIA director. Seeking to redress some of the problems in the drone program, on May 23 President Barack Obama gave a major speech about his counterterrorism policies in Washington in which he said, ""Before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set."" Did Obama's speech and the new policy it sought to inaugurate make any difference to the drone program? Short answer: Yes. Since that speech the Obama administration has dramatically cut the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and has slightly slowed the number of strikes in Yemen. There were 14 drone strikes in Pakistan during the past seven months; an average of one strike every 15 days. In the year before Obama's speech, drone strikes happened every eight days. And there have been no reliably reported civilian casualties in Pakistan from drone strikes since Obama's May speech, according to an analysis of the drone program by the New America Foundation. The pace of drone strikes fell in Yemen after Obama's speech, too, but not as much as it did in Pakistan. Since May 23, there have been 16, an average of about one strike every 13 days. During the previous year, a strike occurred about once every 10 days. It's worth noting that the civilian death rate has fallen steadily overall in both Pakistan and Yemen over the past several years, but the strike on December 12 in Yemen and the civilian casualties it caused is a reminder that there is definitely room for improvement. What can be done? One idea to make the drone program as accountable as possible is to set up an internal U.S. government body that is independent of the CIA and Pentagon that would conduct reviews of the drone strikes after they have occurred. One could imagine, for instance, that a small, nonpartisan group of experts on security and law, similar to the group that Obama appointed to analyze the activities of the NSA, could review the aftermath of drone strikes to examine whether the victims of the strikes were in fact militants who posed some kind of threat to the United States. Such additional oversight would make CIA targeters and drone operators all the more diligent to avoid mistakes.","An al Qaeda leader apologized for hospital attack; U.S. mum on drone that hit wedding party .

"There's no shortage of harrowing stories of life under Islamist militants in northern Mali. Public floggings for smoking a cigarette. Brutal beatings for working as a radio journalist. Broken limbs. Broken hearts. ""For the Islamists, a human being is like an ant you squash, like an animal you slaughter,"" said Sedou Sangare, a resident of the northern town of Gao. Read more: What's behind the instability in Mali? Gao was once a vibrant community  filled with colorful camel caravans lazily strolling down the streets. Bearded men and beaded women mingled freely. Then the Islamists rode in on rundown pickup trucks, armed to the teeth. They banned smoking, television, sports and music --  a major setback for the northern region known for its ""Festival au Desert."" They forbade unwed men and women from mixing in public. An offensive led by France is aiming to stop the militants from expanding their reach to the capital of Mali. But the north remains under the Islamists' iron grip. Read more: United States, Italy lend support for French in Mali . 'Everybody panicked' Though Gao has a majority Muslim population, most residents practice a more relaxed form of the religion. After militants started imposing a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia, throngs took to the streets in protest. ""When they declared Sharia, everybody panicked,"" Sangare said. ""Christians, Muslims, everybody fled."" But the protests did not deter the militants, who publicly punished anyone who defied their teachings.

In August last year, they forced a couple allegedly having an affair into two holes and stoned them to death as terrified residents quietly watched. Lists of public and cruel punishments grew.

The  fabled city includes ancient tombs and wooden structures dating to the 15th century, a major part of its cultural heritage. And those are not the only changes. Women who don't cover their bodies in accordance to the militants' Sharia law, are imprisoned or raped, she said. Their husbands, terrified of killings and amputations, don't utter a word. And gunshots are a common sound. ""If not to disperse women marching, it is to kill dogs that are barking and  preventing the insurgents from sleeping,"" Alainchar said. ""Home has changed.

Last week, another radio journalist was killed, leading Gao residents to retaliate by killing a militant leader. Then there's Suleyman and Muktar, former truck drivers, accused of stealing. Their limbs were hacked off. They are jobless and  wander around the capital. ""I prefer dying to being like this,"" Muktar said. ""My hand hurts, my heart aches. I only have God to ask for help."" Mali descended into chaos last year, when junior military members seized power in a coup. Outraged soldiers accused the government of not providing adequate equipment to battle ethnic Tuareg rebels roaming the vast desert in the north. Tuareg rebels took advantage of the power vacuum after the coup and seized some parts of the north. A power struggle erupted between the rebels and local Islamists, leading the latter to topple the tribe and seize control of two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. Hope amid chaos . The crisis in the north has prompted fears that the al Qaeda-linked extremists will set up shop there. It is ""a serious, ongoing threat,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Wednesday. The French offensive to help the government in its former colony aims to stop the militants from using the vast desert area as a training ground for international attacks. ""We are in for a struggle. We cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven"" for terrorists, Clinton said. International troops from West African nations such as Nigeria are joining the effort to restore some normalcy to the north. Amid the strife and despair, citizens of the former French colony remain hopeful. And as French combat helicopters fly overhead, crowds below erupt into cheers.

"Magic Johnson has some advice for Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling: Sell the team, take the money and enjoy the rest of your life. A day after Sterling appeared on CNN slamming the NBA legend's character, his battle with HIV and his community outreach efforts, Johnson said Tuesday that he feels sorry for the 80-year-old billionaire. ""It's sad. It really is. I'm going to pray for this ... man,"" Johnson told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview. Sterling's explosive CNN interview that aired Monday night was the first time he had spoken publicly since audio recordings surfaced last month of him making racist remarks. Reaction to the taped remarks came fast and furious, and the NBA responded with a lifetime ban for Sterling. Johnson became an involuntary figure in the controversy after Sterling named him in the leaked recording. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" Sterling is heard telling friend V. Stiviano. Johnson told Cooper he is still waiting for an apology from Sterling for getting roped into Sterling's fight with Stiviano, and Johnson called the Monday interview -- in which Sterling directed another tirade at the NBA legend -- ""disturbing."" ""What's really sad is, it's not about me,"" Johnson said. ""This is about the woman you love outing you and taping you and putting your conversation out here for everybody to know. ... This is between you two, but then he wants to include me."" Johnson said he had only met with Sterling three or four times, and most of those discussions had focused on basketball. Johnson couldn't say if the Clippers owner has slipped mentally. Sterling ""seems like he's all there,"" Johnson said. ""But the problem is, he's living in the stone ages."" Johnson: Sterling called me . Sterling went on the offensive in his interview with Cooper when Johnson's name came up, blaming the basketball Hall of Famer for Sterling's delay in apologizing for the racist remarks that have him now fighting to keep his team. ""Wait, be patient, I'll help you, we'll work it out,"" Sterling said the NBA legend told him. Not so, Johnson said Tuesday. In fact, Johnson told CNN, Sterling called him recently and asked him to appear alongside him in an interview with ABC's Barbara Walters. ""I said the number one thing you need to do which you haven't done is apologize to everybody, and myself,"" Johnson said. ""(Sterling replied) 'I'll get to that. I'll get to that.'"" The former NBA star told Sterling that the billionaire businessman needed to consult with attorneys, stressing that the controversy was bigger than Sterling realized. Johnson said Sterling was adamant about Johnson doing the interview, even reaching out a second time. Johnson said his attorneys advised him not to have any further conversations with the embattled owner. Sterling never did the interview with Walters. ""I'm really disturbed by the fact that when he called me he should have said, 'Magic, I'm sorry,'"" Johnson said. A sterling solution: Start talking honestly about race . 'I don't know that young lady' Johnson and the woman at the center of the scandal -- Stiviano -- have met briefly only once, the NBA legend said, taking a picture at a Los Angeles Dodgers game. Johnson is a part-owner of the baseball team. ""I don't know the young lady. I barely know Donald, so now I am caught in the middle of this love affair or whatever they had,"" Johnson said. Stiviano has denied being intimate with Sterling, who when asked about the nature of their relationship declined to answer. Johnson said he doesn't think Sterling understands what a big mistake the Clippers owner's racist comments were or the number of people who were offended by the remarks -- and by Sterling's statements to Cooper that aired Monday night, slamming Johnson again. ""What kind of a guy goes to every city, has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV? Is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about?"" Sterling asked Cooper in Monday's interview. ""I think he should be ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background. But what does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything."" In response, Johnson defended his charitable work and business investments, saying Sterling should have done his homework before making the comments. ""My whole life is devoted to urban America. So, you know I just wish he knew the facts when he's talking,"" Johnson told Cooper. ""But he's a man who's upset and he's reaching. He's reaching. He's trying to find something that he can grab on to help him save his team. And it's not going to happen."" Johnson says Sterling disrespected the work he's done, like helping coffee shops, gyms and theaters open in urban areas. ""That really makes me upset. And then my competitive spirit comes out, because I've done all this great work. All the kids we've sent to college, and I've got 150 kids on scholarship right now."" He also responded to Sterling's HIV remarks, saying he never hid from the diagnosis when he retired from the NBA in 1991. ""I came out like a man, you know, I told the world. I didn't blame nobody else. I understood that what I did was wrong,"" Johnson said. ""OK, so I announced that to the world, and I hoped that I was able to help people in doing that, and I think I did."" Johnson says Sterling's comments about HIV show there's still a stigma that needs to be fought. ""I hope this doesn't set us back,"" Johnson said. ""The stigma is still there. We know that. We've been fighting it for years, and what we want to continue to do is just educate the world that it's OK, that you can high-five a person who has HIV. It's OK. ... It's a shame that Donald used this platform with you, instead of using this platform to come out and apologize to the world, which would have been great."" Opinion: The 5 apology rules that Sterling broke . Magic's interest in a basketball team . Johnson, whose ownership interests also include the WNBA's Sparks in Los Angeles, denied Sterling's assertion that the former Los Angeles Laker was trying to deceive his way into buying the Clippers. The accusation made Johnson laugh. ""If I was going to trick somebody, deceive somebody, be dishonest to somebody, steal somebody's franchise, it's going to be the Los Angeles Lakers,"" said the man who won five league titles while with the team, one of the NBA's marquee franchises. Johnson once owned a minority stake in the Lakers, which have been owned by the Buss family since 1979. But Johnson said he would entertain the idea of buying the Clippers with his five partners who spent more than $2 billion on the Dodgers. He thinks a sale forced by a vote of the NBA Board of Governors would take at least eight months to complete and would be a $1 billion transaction. ""If it comes out and it's for sale, and my Guggenheim (Baseball Management) partners and I say, 'OK, we want to take a look at it, we want to buy it,' of course, we'll make a run for it,"" he said, adding that he has had offers from other NBA teams to become a part owner. Donald Sterling's claims vs. reality . Time for change? Sterling, the longest tenured owner in the NBA, bought the team in 1981 when it was in San Diego and moved into Los Angeles. But after his recorded racist remarks were revealed, the NBA began the process of forcing him to sell the franchise, which some experts have valued between $575 million and $1 billion. It will take a 75% vote of the league's owners to terminate Sterling's franchise rights. The case is with the NBA's finance and advisory committee of 10 owners, which talked by conference call on Tuesday, but didn't recommend sending the matter to the board. Sterling hasn't definitively said if he will sue to keep the team -- which is actually owned by a family trust that includes his wife, Shelly, as a co-executor -- but many analysts expect him to do so. Johnson noted Sterling's past legal issues with his real estate business where he settled lawsuits brought against him and his wife with out-of-court payments. Sterling ""can't buy his way out of this one. He has bought his way out of all the other situations. Can't do it this time,"" Johnson said. Johnson said Sterling should go into retirement. ""You're 80 years old. You've had a tremendous life. And you're going to benefit, whatever the price tag is, from this team selling. Just go ahead and enjoy the rest of your life,"" Johnson said. ""You're fighting a battle that you can't win."" Sterling asked: What has Magic Johnson done? Answer: Quite a lot .","Magic Johnson says Donald Sterling is 'living in the stone ages'

"The brutal mock ISIS recruitment video starts with a simple phrase: Run. Do not walk to ISIS land. Then a body is thrown off a cliff. Later a mosque is blown up, followed by a photo of a body with a severed head. Complete with crucifixions, Muslims being whipped, shot in the head at point-blank range and thrown into ditches, the grisly video is the latest State Department effort to push back against ISIS recruiting efforts by highlighting the group's barbaric nature. The video, which uses the group's own propaganda footage posted online,  illustrates ISIS actions by advertising so-called ""useful skills"" ISIS sympathizers can learn if they join the group: blowing up mosques with Muslims inside, crucifying and executing Muslims and plundering public resources. Entitled ""Welcome to the 'Islamic State' land,"" the video was posted on a dedicated YouTube channel. It was produced by the State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which seeks to combat ISIS extremist narrative on social media. Who is the ISIS? The campaign is directed at Muslims in the United States believed to be vulnerable to recruitment by extremist groups, amid revelations that more than 100 U.S. citizens have traveled overseas to join the jihadist group. The State Department regards social media as a powerful recruitment tool for terrorist groups and in recent years has launched social media efforts to engage jihadists and their sympathizers online, contesting their claims with the intention of dissuading potential converts to Islamic extremism. Alberto Fernandez, coordinator of the State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which runs the program, has called it ""participating in the marketplace of ideas."" In response to this threat, the U.S. government has been ""messaging"" in social media in Arabic, Urdu and Somali for three years, attempting to penetrate the virtual echo chambers of jihadist thought with contrary points of view. Showing off its crimes: How ISIS flaunts its brutality as propaganda . Groups like ISIS are posting gruesome video of decapitated heads as trophies of battlefield victories, or images of victims from their own side, captioned with vows to avenge them. Links to grainy phone-camera footage abound, documenting everything from group executions to a video appeal summoning Muslim women to come to Syria to find a husband among the Islamist rebels. The content is disseminated swiftly around the world on the Internet through a diverse network of jihadists and their supporters, journalists, analysts and onlookers. While al Qaeda and its affiliates and sympathizers were once the focus of the U.S. campaigns to counter violent extremism, ISIS has increasingly become a target of U.S. efforts. Key White House adviser: U.S. will fight ISIS with a coalition . In addition to YouTube, the center now runs a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign to counter violent extremism launched late last year called ""Think Again, Turn Away."" ""Our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda. Don't be misled by those who break up families and destroy their true heritage,"" the State Department said on the campaign's Facebook page.

"(CNN) -- Yep. You read the headline right. We are so used to the constant flow of bad news from much of the Muslim world that it's hard to get your head around the good news when things go right somewhere like Afghanistan. Consider that the Afghans have done exactly what the feckless and irresponsible Iraqi government failed to do during the past several years. On Monday Afghans formed a ""national unity government"" with the once-bitter rivals Dr. Ashraf Ghani, taking the role of president and Dr. Adullah Abdullah taking the role of chief executive officer; similar, it is envisioned, to a prime ministerial role. What makes this all the more important is that Ghani is identified with the Pashtuns, the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, while Abdullah is identified with the sizable Tajik ethnic group. This is precisely the opposite of what the government of Nuri al-Maliki did in Iraq, which ruled as a Shia chauvinist party and excluded Sunnis from positions of any power or influence. Tuesday, the day after Ghani and Abdullah were inaugurated, they signed the Bilateral Security Agreement, which allows 9,800 American troops to remain in Afghanistan after NATO combat operations cease at the end of December. Again, this is exactly the opposite of what happened in Iraq where the Iraqis would not sign a similar basing agreement with the United States. As a result, almost all American troops left the country in December 2011. The result of Maliki's decision to exclude the Sunnis from any form of power meant that many Sunnis passively or actively supported ISIS, which is now almost at the gates of Baghdad. And, largely as a result of the rise of ISIS, between June and September, 5,500 Iraqi civilians were killed, according to the UN. By contrast, 3,000 civilians were killed in the Afghan War in 2013. Afghanistan and Iraq have roughly the same size populations, which therefore makes Iraq today about eight times more violent than Afghanistan. The signing of the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) is important not only because it allows thousands of American soldiers to remain in Afghanistan as well as a smaller number of troops from other NATO countries, but also because it will restore the confidence of the business community in Afghanistan. Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai's stubborn refusal to sign the BSA for many months had contributed to an atmosphere of uncertainty in the country, which had damaged the Afghan economy significantly. That will change now. What would make the situation in Afghanistan change even more for the better is if the leading contenders in the American presidential race added into their platforms a pledge to extend the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan past December 2016. President Obama's decision to pull out all American troops from Afghanistan two years from now does not bind whoever wins the 2016 presidential campaign. After all, at considerable U.S. and Afghan government effort, a Strategic Partnership Agreement has already been negotiated between the two countries that runs until at least 2024 and that would easily provide the basis for a longer term troop commitment. Many Afghans wants some kind of long-term American military presence in their country as a guarantor of their stability. They only need to look at the carnage in Iraq to remind themselves that the model they want to emulate is South Korea with its decades-long U.S. military presence, not Iraq. At the end of the Korean war in 1953 South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world; now, under an American security umbrella, it is one of the richest. And the appearance of ISIS-like Taliban militias in Afghanistan over the past week who have beheaded 15 Afghan civilians is a reminder to Afghan and Americans and alike that they have a long-term strategic interest in preventing Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists again.","Amid all the bad news, there's a sign of progress in Afghanistan, says Peter Bergen .

"Conventional political wisdom suggests that immigration reform in a midterm election year has a snowball's chance in July of getting any traction. But maybe that wisdom isn't so conventional. Some Republicans say they are warily preparing for the possibility that President Barack Obama could use executive action this summer to bypass congressional gridlock and act on immigration reform. Those changes could include making noncriminals and minor offenders the lowest deportation priorities, a recommendation the Congressional Hispanic Caucus stressed in its meeting earlier this month with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Republicans have good reason to worry, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor at Cornell University Law School. ""If I had to predict, I think the president will make some administrative fine tuning of his immigration policies in the hopes of pacifying the immigration activists,"" said Yale-Loehr. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Florida, worries that day will come in August when lawmakers have headed home to their districts to campaign. Diaz-Balart and his staff are cranking up the pace on crafting a measure that would help some undocumented immigrants gain their citizenship through currently existing channels, said Cesar Gonzalez, the congressman's chief of staff. He declined to say which existing channels the bill would use. He added that the measure would also strengthen border security and try to address the backlog of green card applications for permanent status. The White House has directed the Homeland Security Department to reexamine the administration's deportation policy following criticism over the roughly 2 million deportations that have occurred during Obama's tenure. As recently as last week, the president declined to give a timeline on when those immigration policy reforms might occur. Should Obama use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform? ""The only way to truly fix it is through congressional action,"" Obama told reporters on Thursday."" We have already tried to take as many administrative steps as we could. We're going to review it one more time to see if there's more that we can do to make it more consistent with common sense and more consistent with, I think, the attitudes of the American people, which is we shouldn't be in the business necessarily of tearing families apart who otherwise are law-abiding."" Obama could take matters into his own hands . Still, some Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a potential 2016 presidential candidate who had a key role in helping write a Senate-passed immigration reform bill, have said they are concerned Obama will soon tire of congressional inaction and use executive action. Diaz-Balart hopes to have his measure ready for a debate by June or July. ""We think that's the last window for our bill,"" Gonzalez said. That ""last window"" would likely close because, as House Republican leadership has indicated, using the presidential pen and phone on immigration reform would further sour the relationship between the Obama administration and the GOP. While the Senate passed its sweeping immigration package last year, the measure has stalled in the GOP-controlled House. Republicans in that chamber have followed a more incremental approach with lawmakers -- like Diaz-Balart -- offering their own measures. But Republicans might be gun-shy about taking up this type of measure, political experts say. ""There's a general wariness in the Republican caucus to take up immigration reform -- even incrementally,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""Taking up immigration has the potential to divide the caucus. There are some who want to move forward with immigration reform, but there are also Republicans who represent Republican districts who don't feel the pressure to take it up."" That's because immigration reform is a thorny topic and not one Republican lawmakers are likely to want to embrace in an election year. ""Republicans are trying to balance the prospect of potentially doing very well in the midterms with bringing up legislation or pieces of legislation that could potentially divide the caucus,"" Gonzales said. Tensions between Obama and GOP on immigration . The looming threat of executive action also does little to soothe tensions between Obama and Republicans. ""That will make it almost impossible to ever do immigration reform, because he will spoil the well to the point where no one will trust him by giving him a new law that he will implement the way the Congress intended,"" House Speaker John Boehner told Fox News earlier this month. A tale of two Republicans: A story of the GOP and immigration reform . According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Boehner also told industry groups and campaign donors in March at a Las Vegas fundraiser  that, when it comes to immigration reform, the House Speaker is: ""hellbent on getting this done this year."" In response to media questions about this statement, Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck emailed reporters on Friday saying ""Everyone can tell their editors to chill."" ""Nothing has changed,"" Buck said. ""As he's said many times, the speaker believes step-by-step reform is important, but it won't happen until the president builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law."" Still, some Democratic operatives are banking that Republicans â€” who lost big among African-Americans, women and Latinos in the 2012 presidential race â€” will feel pressure to act on immigration reform. The Service Employees International Union said last year it was spending $500,000 to help defeat more than a half-dozen House Republicans who the group believes are vulnerable on immigration in November. Earlier this month, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said race was part of the reason Republicans in that chamber are blocking immigration reform efforts. ""I think race has something to do with the fact that they're not bringing up an immigration bill,"" she said. Republicans who have pushed immigration reform and political experts both say there is now a narrow window for the GOP to get something done. Late spring and summer ""might open a small window of time for Republicans to act,"" Yale-Loehr said. ""If the primaries in spring and summer show immigration is not that big an issue with activists, then Republicans will feel they can go out on the limb and support reform.""","Immigration reform could get a second life under the threat of executive action .
President Barack Obama has suggested he might act to curb deportations .

"Barack Obama's appearance on ""The View"" on Tuesday topped a week spent cozying up to the world of entertainment, including a dinner hosted by George Clooney that raised $15 million and a $5,000-a-plate extravaganza with Ricky Martin. Presidents have always chased Hollywood's vote. Herbert Hoover's first overnight guest in the White House was Louis B. Mayer, and Richard Nixon had dinner parties with John Wayne. So Obama's willingness to dish dirt on the ""View"" sofa is historically in keeping. Some in the news media are convinced that Obama's endorsement of gay marriage was designed to raise Hollywood dollars. They may have a point, but Obama wasn't just after money. The movie community is enjoying a renaissance of cultural power this election cycle, and that's what the president wants to harness. It's noteworthy that Obama's relationship with Hollywood is far from strong. His biggest problem has always been his lack of enthusiasm for massaging the egos of movie stars. In 2008, he was certainly happy to take Hollywood's cash: One Beverly Hills fundraiser alone pulled in $9 million. But after the election, Obama remained aloof from those who had supported him, and invitations to the White House in the first year of the administration were surprisingly few. There's a glimpse of that alleged awkwardness in Edward Klein's new book about Obama. In ""The Amateur: Barack Obama in the White House"" Klein writes, Oprah Winfrey arrives at the White House for an interview and is shocked to find that she has to join the queue at security like everyone else. She even has to talk to staff who make only $75,000 a year (yes, Klein lists that as a complaint), and Oprah is humiliated when Michelle Obama fails to treat her as an equal. Clearly the wife of the leader of the free world needs to learn a little humility. As a result, there had been rumors in the Hollywood press, before the gay marriage endorsement, about declining political and financial support for the president. Matt Damon's complaint that Obama is too centrist (""I no longer hope for audacity"") summed up the mood of the liberal movie community nicely. When Obama visited Hollywood in September 2011, he was reduced to appearing at an event hosted by a sitcom actor at the House of Blues rock club. Yet Hollywood is so good at raising cash that reliance on just a handful of loyal friends can still produce impressive results, as the astonishing $15 million takeaway from last week's Clooney dinner suggests. The biggest bundlers, bringing in $500,000 each, include producer Harvey Weinstein and DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, while actress Eva Longoria has raised at least $200,000. There have been $38,000-a-plate dinners with Will Smith, Spike Lee, Tom Hanks and Will Ferrell. Of course, the same-sex marriage endorsement has increased Hollywood enthusiasm for the president and induced liberal skeptics to give more. Producer Norman Lear, who had withheld support until now, announced that he and his wife would give the maximum $40,000 each. Hollywood isn't just about money; it also exerts a quiet cultural power. Joe Biden was right when he credited ""Will and Grace"" with shifting popular attitudes towards homosexuality. Television has the power to acculturate and acclimatize viewers to social change. Consider that ""Modern Family,"" which features a gay couple and their adopted daughter, was ranked the favorite sitcom among Republicans in 2010. Incredibly, Time magazine put ""Glee"" star Chris Colfer in its 2011 listing of the 100 most influential people in the world. That's right: A comedy-musical star is just as important to humanity as Christine Lagarde or Kim Jong Un. Hollywood's soft power has been augmented in the past four years by two innovations. First, Twitter has dramatically expanded the reach of stars who aren't even explicitly political. In 2009, actor Ashton Kutcher entered a contest with CNN to see who could reach a million followers first. Kutcher won. Today, he is followed by 10.6 million people, far more than Mitt Romney's 500,000. Were Kutcher to write something political, it would require only 10% of his followers -- and then 10% of each of their followers -- to retweet it for it to become a viral sensation. Second, Hollywood's activist base has moved away from pushing candidates and toward campaigning for ideas. The falling price of media technology, and the platform that the Internet provides, means that moviemakers can now ""do it for themselves"" rather than wait for the Democratic National Committee to recruit them. Same-sex marriage is at the center of this revolution, resulting in a plethora of homemade Hollywood ad campaigns. Local Republicans and Democrats are often united in supporting legal efforts to support gay rights, and their focus brings attention to the issue. In March, Dustin Lance Black's play about California's Proposition 8, which blocked same-sex marriage, was performed in Los Angeles with an all-star cast. Such events, which pursue political rather than strictly electoral goals, are worth millions in publicity to the gay rights movement. All this means that even as the money keeps rolling in, Obama has to stay on the right side of the moviemakers. Perhaps this is another reason why he's intent on playing the culture war card. Hollywood is full of rich people, so health care and jobs aren't issues that interest the new power players. But two people denied the right to express their love through marriage? Now that's a great story.","Timothy Stanley: Obama has done some big Hollywood fundraising in recent days .

"Former Egyptian military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was officially declared the winner of the country's presidential election on Tuesday, with election officials saying he won more than 96% of last month's vote. His sole opponent, Hamdeen Sabahy, received 3.9% of the vote, the country's election commission said. Sabahy conceded defeat last week. Several thousand people in Cairo's Tahrir Square celebrated Tuesday's announcement. Fireworks erupted overhead as vendors sold Egyptian flags and balloons marked with Sisi's face. Military and security personnel watched from the edges as people danced and sang. U.S. President Barack Obama plans to speak with el-Sisi in the coming days, the White House said Wednesday. The United States looks forward to working with el-Sisi ""to advance our strategic partnership and the many interests shared by the United States and Egypt,"" the White House press secretary said in a statement. The election was called amid months of political turbulence that saw Mohamed Morsy -- the country's first democratically elected president after the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak --  removed from power in a July military coup. El-Sisi, who was army chief at the time, stepped down from his military post this year to run for president. Though Sabahy conceded defeat, he didn't embrace the process. Allegations were made that his campaign representatives were attacked and detained, and that el-Sisi's representatives were allowed inside polling stations, Egypt's state-run Ahram Online news agency reported last week. ""We cannot give any credibility or ratification to the announced numbers of turnout or results,"" Sabahy said. ""The announced results are an insult to the intelligence of the Egyptians."" The White House said while it is pleased that international observers were allowed to participate in the election, ""we also share concerns raised by observation groups about the restrictive political environment in which this election took place."" ""As Egypt looks toward parliamentary elections later this year, we urge the government to consider the recommendations of the observer groups on ways to improve the administration of future elections,"" the White House said.

"A federal investigator said he's never seen a train climb an escalator like the one that jumped the tracks at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport early Monday. The crash of the Chicago Transit Authority Blue Line train injured 32 people, although none seriously, according to Chicago Fire officials. The eight-car train failed to stop at the end of the line when it arrived at the airport station at 2:52 a.m., a Chicago Fire official said. The lead car appeared to have climbed an escalator adjacent to the passenger platform. ""I've investigated many accidents and trains do different things,"" National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim DePaepe told reporters. ""It's all about kinetic force. I have not seen an accident like this personally."" NTSB experts will examine video from station cameras and one on the front of the train for clues to the cause of the crash, DePaepe said. A union official told reporters Monday that the train's driver may have fallen asleep, CNN affiliate WLS reported. ""There are indications that she dozed off, yes,"" Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly said, according to WLS. Almost all of the 32 people taken to four hospitals had been released by the afternoon, he said. Investigators are still waiting for the train operator to be released from the hospital so that they can talk to her, he said. The wrecked train will not be moved at least until Tuesday so that investigators can examine it, DePaepe said.

"Mitt Romney campaign said it raised more than $100 million in June, surpassing the more than $77 million it raised the previous months. President Barack Obama's campaign has not yet released its June numbers, which have to be filed with the Federal Election Commission by July 20. Romney for the first time is expected to have raised more money than Obama. At a time when the economy is still struggling to recover and American families are pinching pennies, we decided to see exactly how far $100 million goes. 366 new homes: Based on 2010 census data, which put the average cost of a new home in the United States at $272,900. Health insurance for 4,824 families of four:  According to the Milliman Index, the average cost of employer-based health insurance for a family of four in 2012 is $20,728. 2,646 one-year tuitions at private colleges or universities or 6,660 one-year tuitions at public institutions:  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average cost for one year at a four-year private college or university is $32,790; $15,014 for a public institution. A night at the movies for 2 million families of four: Based on data collected from AMC movie theaters across the country, the approximate cost of a night at the movies for a family of four is $50. 1,668 Hermes Birkin bags: Known as a sign of wealth and opulence, Romney's June fundraising numbers could outfit more than 1,500 women with one of the most exclusive of the purses -- a crocodile bag going for $59,950 on eBay. 29,779,630 gallons of gas, enough to fill 1,751,742 17-gallon American gas tanks: According to AAA, the national average cost for a gallon of regular gas on Friday was $3.358. 29,180,040 gallons of milk: Filling cereal bowls and glasses to dunk cookies into for millions of American families, the average cost of a gallon of milk in May was $3.427.

"Iraqi authorities are looking at a video that purportedly shows Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivering a sermon in Mosul to determine whether it is really the notorious leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Iraq's military spokesman said Sunday. The video surfaced on social media sites tied to ISIS, the terror group that now calls itself the Islamic State. It shows a man identified as al-Baghdadi conducting Friday prayers at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri. ""The video is being analyzed and cross-referenced with intelligence data to determine whether it is in fact al-Baghdadi,"" said Qassim Atta, the military spokesman. The United States government is also examining the video. If it is al-Baghdadi, it would be one of the first known appearances of the elusive extremist militant leader to be captured on video. Very few images have been made public of al-Baghdadi. ISIS fighters took control of Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, in early June following a quick campaign that saw Iraqi security forces quickly fold under their assault. The release of the video comes days after unconfirmed reports surfaced that the militant leader had either been killed or wounded in airstrikes in Iraq's western Anbar province or in the Mosul area. The timing of the video also appears to coincide with a declaration by ISIS last week of the creation of an Islamic state that stretches from the northeast city of Aleppo in Syria to Iraq's Diyala province. As part of that declaration, an ISIS spokesman said the group would now be known as the Islamic State, and al-Baghdadi as its leader would be known as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim -- a reference to the leading religious figure considered a successor to the Prophet Mohammed. The video, which was released by the media arm of ISIS, identified the man as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, which shows dozens of people, including men who appear to be bodyguards, listening to the sermon and praying. Several automatic weapons are displayed near the man delivering the sermon. In the video, the man purported to be al-Baghdadi urges people to follow his call to create an Islamic state in Iraq and Syria and wage jihad, or holy war, during Ramadan -- the holy month of fasting for Muslims that began at the end of June. ""It is a month from Allah when we are protected from hell, and this is every night  -- nights during which the marketplace of jihad is open,"" he said, according to a translation of the video posted by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors terror groups. Very little is known about al-Baghdadi, a name he appears to have adopted just before taking the reins of al Qaeda in Iraq, a group that later reformed under the banner of ISIS. A biography posted on militant websites last year said he earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad. A man named Al-Baghdadi was detained for four years in Camp Bucca, which was a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq. He was released in 2009. CNN cannot confirm whether it is the same man.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Travis Barker has a full agenda for 2011, beginning with his debut solo album (out on March 15) and a tour with Lil Wayne, plus plans to finish the long-delayed Blink-182 reunion album for release later this year. But it hasn't come easy for the drummer, who was barely two songs into the making of his new ""Give the Drummer Some"" album when he was seriously injured in a 2008 small plane crash. Barker and his friend DJ AM were the only survivors. ""Honestly, I never thought the album would be finished,"" Barker tells Rolling Stone. ""For a while after my accident, I was just recovering. No one really thought I would be able to play drums after all the surgeries and everything. That was always on my mind. Once I was in the studio, it was like, 'I can walk now, I can play the drums still. I have to finish this.'"" Random Notes: Hottest Rock Pics . His recovery from the crash took longer and was more painful than was publicly known at the time. Barker went through 16 surgeries and nearly had a foot amputated. For a time, his left hand was completely numb. ""It was sketchy, so I came a long way. And mentally I was a basket case,"" he says. ""It was a big amount of time to get off of 20 medications that they had me on, and then physically getting in shape. It was heavy."" Barker was on tour in 2009 with the reunited Blink-182 when the call came that DJ AM had overdosed in New York. ""It was hard for me to even get in the bus and be moving around. Me and AM would always speak. We were a support system for each other for a year after the crash."" Hottest Live Photos of the Week . After the Blink-182 tour, Barker spent much of the last year completing tracks for ""Give the Drummer Some,"" with cameos by the likes of Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Slash and Kid Cudi. The sound isn't punk. Instead, it's brooding hip-hop propelled by real drumbeats. Slash unfurls a fiery Santana impression on the Latin-flavored ""Saturday Night,"" while Tom Morello rages on guitar through a storm of scratching and thundering beats on ""Carry It,"" with vocals from RZA and Raekwon. ""When I look at music everything is blurred, and I like it that way,"" Barker says of his genre mixing. ""I grew up like that, hanging out with different types of people who listened to so many different types of music. I never wanted to be part of any one clique. I loved it all."" Blink-182 began work on a new album in late 2009, but for most of the last year the band had other things to do. ""It seems like forever,"" Barker says with a laugh. The band is now scheduled to deliver the album in June. ""This year has been the most active Blink year. We're locking ourselves in a studio. I was in there last night."" Barker will be on the road in March and April with Wayne and Rick Ross for the ""I Am Still Music Tour."" (Mixmaster Mike of the Beastie Boys and a rotating lineup of guest vocalists will join them.) He'll then produce three songs with an unsigned artist for the ""Guitar Center Presents Your Next Album With Travis Barker"" competition. And the drummer expects to record again as the Transplants with Rancid's Tim Armstrong. Keeping busy is important, he explains. ""Playing my drums is therapy.""

"An emergency contraceptive manufactured in Europe will come with a new label in 2014, warning that the pill may not be effective for women over a certain weight. The same may be true for emergency contraceptives in the United States. French manufacturer HRA Pharma was conducting research on another topic related to its emergency contraceptive Norlevo when scientists realized there was ""a clear impact of weight"" on the drug's effectiveness, CEO Erin Gainer said. HRA Pharma scientists discovered Norlevo began losing its effectiveness when women reach about 75 kilograms, or 165 pounds, Gainer said, and showed an ""absence of effectiveness"" at about 80 kilograms, or about 176 pounds. ""We felt it was our ethical duty ... to report those results to our health authorities here in Europe,"" Gainer said. Norlevo is identical to the emergency contraceptive Plan B One-Step, said Kelly Cleland, a public health expert at Princeton University. Both are LNG ECs, or emergency contraceptives that include levonorgestrel, a synthetic version of the hormone progestogen. Emergency contraceptives are often called the morning-after pill because they work by interfering with ovulation, preventing the fertilization of an egg. Teva Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures Plan B, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. The Food and Drug Administration ""is currently reviewing the available and related scientific information on this issue, including the publication upon which the Norlevo labeling change was based,"" said spokeswoman Erica Jefferson. ""The agency will then determine what, if any, labeling changes to emergency contraceptives are warranted."" Plan B is available in the United States without a prescription to anyone of any age. Its generic versions Next Choice One Dose and My Way are also the same as Norlevo, Cleland said. Under U.S. federal law, generic brands cannot change their labeling until the name brand product does. ""Actavis' Next Choice One Dose is approved by the FDA as a safe, effective and therapeutically equivalent treatment option to its brand counterpart,"" said Actavis spokesman David Belian. ""Therefore, should any update to the Plan B labeling take place, we would make the appropriate change to our product as well."" European health authorities approved the Norlevo label change a few weeks ago, but it will take several months to implement in all the countries HRA Pharma supplies, Gainer said. The new packaging slip will say the emergency contraceptive is ""not recommended ... if you weigh (165 pounds) or more,"" according to Mother Jones, which first reported the story. It is unclear why emergency contraceptives may be less effective for overweight women, said Anna Glasier, an expert in reproductive medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Glasier published a study in 2011 that analyzed the risk of pregnancy for women who had taken emergency contraception. Glasier and her colleagues found that obese women had three times the risk of getting pregnant after taking emergency contraception than those with a normal body weight. The risk was greater for those who had taken levonorgestrel pills, compared with those who had taken ulipristal acetate, which is used in another emergency contraceptive called Ella. ""There has been some evidence over the years that low doses of progestogen-only contraceptives have less efficacy in heavier women, but we do not know why,"" Glasier told CNN. That said, ""it is well recognized that body weight affects the way drugs are metabolized."" Previous research has shown that women who weigh more than 155 pounds are at a higher risk of regular oral contraception failure. These drugs take longer to reach normal concentration levels in the blood of obese women compared with normal weight women, according to one study. That may be one reason emergency contraceptives are less effective. Glasier noted that the number of obese women in her study was small, so it's hard to make broad recommendations based on the research. In the general population, studies show levonorgestrel emergency contraception prevents about 50% of expected pregnancies. ""You are probably better to take LNG-EC after unprotected sex than just to leave it to chance even if you are obese,"" Glasier said. ""When faced with a choice ... I don't think the findings are strong enough for us to tell women that they should not use LNG-EC,"" Cleland agreed. ""Because Plan-B One Step is now available over-the-counter and is by far the easiest EC method to get, this is the method that most women are familiar with."" Cleland recommends overweight women who are worried about the pill's effectiveness use an emergency contraceptive with ulipristal acetate, or a copper IUD. IUDs, or intrauterine devices, can be inserted by a doctor up to five days after unprotected sex to help prevent pregnancy. It's important to note that women shouldn't be relying solely on emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy. ""The best way to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy among women who are sexually active is to use effective birth control correctly and consistently,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Find the method that works best for you by talking to your doctor.","Norlevo emergency contraceptive may be ineffective for overweight women .

"(CNN) -- The two U.S. journalists released from North Korea last month after five months in captivity said ""the psychological wounds of imprisonment are slow to heal."" Freed U.S. journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee said they spent less than a minute on North Korean soil. In a column posted on the Los Angeles Times Web site Tuesday night, Laura Ling and Euna Lee also said they were seized by North Korean soldiers on Chinese soil. They raised suspicions about their guide and wondered if they had been ""lured into a trap."" ""We didn't spend more than a minute on North Korean soil before turning back, but it is a minute we deeply regret,"" they said. Working for California-based Current TV, a media venture of Vice President Al Gore, the two journalists were arrested in March after stepping on North Korean soil. They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor and eventually pardoned by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after he met with President Clinton early in August. Ling and Lee didn't go into much more detail about their experience in captivity, saying there are ""things that are still too painful to visit."" But they provided information about the day of their arrest and reporting on North Korean defections to China and the human trafficking industry that supports them. Accompanied by a guide, the pair said they had been at the ""frozen"" Tumen River on March 17 separating China and North Korea ""to document a well-used trafficking route."" ""As the sun appeared over the horizon, our guide stepped onto the ice. We followed him,"" they said, referring to a Korean-Chinese man they said has worked for foreign journalists. A producer, Mitch Koss, was also with them. The border between China and North Korea was not clearly marked, and it had no fences or barbed wire, they said. ""But we knew our guide was taking us closer to the North Korean side of the river. As he walked, he began making deep, low hooting sounds, which we assumed was his way of making contact with North Korean border guards he knew,"" they said. The journalists said that the guide told them he called people in North Korea the night before to arrange an interview, but that effort failed. However, he said he would show the journalists ""the no-man's land along the river, where smugglers pay off guards to move human traffic from one country to another."" ""When we set out, we had no intention of leaving China, but when our guide beckoned for us to follow him beyond the middle of the river, we did, eventually arriving at the riverbank on the North Korean side. ""He pointed out a small village in the distance where he told us that North Koreans waited in safe houses to be smuggled into China via a well-established network that has escorted tens of thousands across the porous border,"" they wrote. The women said they became nervous and headed back to China. ""Midway across the ice, we heard yelling. We looked back and saw two North Korean soldiers with rifles running toward us. Instinctively, we ran. We were firmly back inside China when the soldiers apprehended us."" They wrote that Koss and the guide outran the guards, but the two women got caught. ""We tried with all our might to cling to bushes, ground, anything that would keep us on Chinese soil, but we were no match for the determined soldiers. They violently dragged us back across the ice to North Korea and marched us to a nearby army base, where we were detained."" The women have raised doubts about their guide. They said he ""seemed cautious and responsible"" in the days before the capture, and noted he was always concerned ""about protecting our interview subjects and not taking unnecessary risks."" ""In retrospect, the guide behaved oddly, changing our starting point on the river at the last moment and donning a Chinese police overcoat for the crossing, measures we assumed were security precautions.

"Washington (CNN)Iranian and American negotiators preparing to square off in Geneva next week over Iran's nuclear ambitions will also be eying another showdown brewing in Washington. One year after a Republican-led coalition in the Senate came up just short of a deal, GOP lawmakers are poised to wield their new power in the Senate to push a bill authorizing additional sanctions against Iran. But the new 54-member majority doesn't guarantee that Republicans can muster the 67 votes they need to override a presidential veto, and the fight is already underway for the votes that could fill the gap. With fewer than two months until diplomats' March 1 framework agreement deadline, and expecting the White House to start knocking on swing senators' doors, supporters know the clock is ticking to pass a sanctions bill they say will ratchet up pressure on Iran. But for opponents of additional sanctions, the ticking is more like a time bomb as a sanctions bill will torpedo negotiations and set the U.S. on a path to war with Iran, they claim. For Sen. Mark Kirk, the Republican half of the Kirk-Menendez sanctions bill he has pushed for the last three years, the sooner a sanctions bill hits the Senate floor, the better -- both politically and policy-wise. ""If the Senate was allowed to vote tomorrow, I would be able to get two-thirds,"" Kirk said Sunday in a phone interview. ""Now is the time to put pressure on Iran especially with oil prices so low. We are uniquely advantaged at this time to shut down this nuclear program."" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), another major proponent of the legislation, told CNN last month the Kirk-Menendez bill ""will come up for a vote in January,"" a pledge he made the same day to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a meeting in Jerusalem. Kirk said he backed that timing but insisted that it depends on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A McConnell spokesman called the legislation ""a priority,"" but said there isn't yet a schedule for a sanctions bill. Republicans have been clamoring for additional sanctions on Iran, but with control of Congress in their hands, Republican lawmakers will also have to own the consequences of sanctions legislation -- which the President, State Department and Iranian officials have warned could derail negotiations. ""We have long believed that Congress should not consider any new sanctions while negotiations are underway, in order to give our negotiators the time and space they need to fully test the current diplomatic opportunity.  New sanctions threaten the diplomatic process currently underway,"" a senior administration official told CNN. The Kirk-Menendez bill that died in the Senate last year would reimpose sanctions on Iran if Obama couldn't certify that Iran doesn't finance terror groups that have attacked Americans and would keep Iran from maintaining low-level nuclear enrichment in a final deal, just a few terms that are much stricter than the current framework for negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 world powers. Those congressional provisions are ""poison pills,"" according to Dylan Williams, head of government affairs at J Street, a group that bills itself as pro-Israel. It lobbied heavily on the issue last year and is ramping up for another forceful push. ""All of these things are poison pills, far from the clean sanctions, just-if-things-go-wrong idea,"" Williams said. ""We know that many if not most of the people pushing for legislation don't want diplomacy to work."" J Street challenges the Israel lobby from within . Kirk has already been working with Sen. Bob Menendez, of New Jersey, his Democratic partner on the bill, to rework some of its language -- changes that could potentially draw more Democratic support. The pair are still working on final language for the bill, which drew 59 cosponsors last year, though Kirk said he is working to stave off as many changes as possible -- ""The more changes, the worse,"" he said. The Illinois Republican expects a high-profile challenge from the White House and its allies, but he will be getting his own backup from some Capitol Hill heavyweights: the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, which typically spends more than $2.5 million a year on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. ""I think they're pretty damned strong. This would be the No. 1 thing for them,"" Kirk said of AIPAC. Intense lobbying from AIPAC could help the sanctions supporters win back the four Democrats who joined 13 others in cosponsoring the sanctions bill last year, but later backtracked their support. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Chris Coons of Delaware rejected the idea of moving forward amid negotiations after the White House and allies made its push on Capitol Hill to keep the measure from a floor vote. ""I did not sign it with the intention that it would ever be voted upon or used upon while we were negotiating,"" Manchin said on MSNBC after Obama talked about Iran in his State of the Union address. ""I signed it because I wanted to make sure the president had a hammer if he needed it and showed them how determined we were to do it and use it if we had to."" After talks failed to materialize into an agreement by the November 2014 deadline, some Democrats have started to lose patience with the stop-and-stall pace of negotiations with Iran and are facing pressure from groups like AIPAC to support a sanctions bill, though the White House insists the negotiations have yielded tangible results: rolling back Iran's nuclear program during negotiations. But even if Kirk, Menendez and their allies can pressure those four Democrats into signing on, they will need to pull three more Senate Democrats who didn't cosponsor the bill last year to secure the 15 Democrats needed to override a presidential veto. And they won't just be targeted by AIPAC. A coalition of dove organizations is already putting the gears in motion for what they expect to be the toughest battle yet on this issue, and while they're clear-eyed about the uphill climb they face, they dismiss the overconfident stride of pro-sanctions leaders. These groups will look to paint any new sanctions as a step onto the warpath with Iran and show wary Democrats that they have the grassroots backing to stave off attacks from groups like AIPAC. Clinton defends Obama on Iran talks . More than 400 faith leaders and activists traveled to D.C. in late November to lobby Congress against the sanctions in a day of action organized by the Friends Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker-founded organization, and the group plans to drive its 50,000 supporters to flood Congress with calls and letters in the weeks ahead. ""The real trick that we have to do is really to make that opposition -- both in the public and that opposition on the Hill -- to really make it become public and to amplify those voices,"" said Kate Gould, the group's lead lobbyist on the issue. ""Because right now you hear from, it's Lindsey Graham and (Marco) Rubio, who are very confident in their prognosis and have made it sound like it's inevitable that these sanctions will pass with a veto-proof majority."" To accomplish that, FCNL has worked with other groups like J Street and about 70 other groups in an expanding coalition opposing the sanctions in an effort to paint the debate not as a benchmark for support for Israel, but rather what Gould calls a ""wider, anti-war issue"" that resonates with a war-weary public. That's where groups like VoteVets.org come in. The group, which represents more than 400,000 pro-peace veterans and their families, is looking to drive home the risks and repercussions of war. ""As a veteran I was sent to Iraq and you know there are still ambiguous causes for that conflict. We rushed in with bad intel and it could have been a very avoidable situation,"" said Garett Reppenhagen, who leads the group's grassroots effort against the sanctions bill. ""I know firsthand the consequences of failed negotiations.""","Republicans are poised to wield their new Senate majority to push new Iran sanctions .

"Cuban-Americans have had an outsized influence in keeping the U.S. embargo since Fidel Castro seized power. Now a younger generation, with strong familial ties there but far removed from the memories of Castro's revolution, want the embargo to end. ""Asking whether someone is for or against the embargo was a good question in 1962,"" said Giancarlo Sopo, a 31-year-old Miami-born marketing executive in New York. ""We've allowed this policy to become the 800-pound gorilla in the room and a distraction from the atrocities of the regime, the human rights abuses, and the aspirations of the Cuban people,"" he added. His statement is startling. Sopo says his grandfather was murdered by the Castro regime. Sopo's father, who he says witnessed the killing, fought in the Bay of Pigs invasion. According to analysts, as more Cuban-American millennials begin to question the embargo, more will begin to abandon their Republican roots for the Democratic Party, like Sopo did. Democrats have long-hoped to make inroads with Cuban-Americans, the only Latino group that still leans Republican, and have taken notice of the generational shift. Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, deemed the clear front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, recently said she would like to see the U.S. move toward normalizing relations with Cuba.  ""I think it has propped up the Castros because they can blame everything on the embargo,"" she said during a July interview on Fusion. CNN reached out for comment but no one from Clinton's office was immediately available for a response. This year's Florida gubernatorial race will measure just how strong the GOP's grasp on Cuban Americans remains. Incumbent Republican Gov. Rick Scott who supports the embargo faces former Republican-now-Democrat Governor Charlie Crist who during a July campaign stop in Miami's Little Havana openly called for an end to the embargo, a move that had been considered political suicide in the state. At a debate sponsored by CNN in Florida earlier this week, Crist said he wouldn't be willing to go so far as meeting with Raul Castro, but he defended his opposition to the embargo. ""The embargo has been in place for over 50 years, it has not worked. The intent of the embargo was to get rid of the Castro brothers. They're still there,"" Crist said. Related: Florida debate turns bitter . ""The message that worked well in the past -- Cuban Embargo -- and moved older Cubans to vote Republican, is not as impactful for younger U.S. born Cubans,"" said Luis Miranda Jr., a managing partner at MirRam Group, a political consulting firm. He says messages of employment, economic recovery and fixing the broken immigration system is what resonates with this group. It's not just Cuban-Americans, many young Latinos are questioning the embargo. Twenty nine-year-old old Chicago-based writer Hector Luis Alamo, who is of Puerto Rican and Honduran descent,  says people in his generation feel that ""It's about damn time"" for the embargo to end. Alamo says that he and every other millennial he knows desperately want the opportunity to travel to Cuba -- even those that are not Cuban. ""I don't believe that [being of Cuban descent] matters,"" Alamo said. ""As an American, I have a vested interest in the policies of my government not only towards its own citizens, but also towards the citizens of other countries."" On Oct. 11, the NY Times joined the anti-embargo chorus. ""For the first time in more than 50 years, shifting politics in the United States and changing policies in Cuba make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo"", wrote the Times' editorial board. ""The generation that adamantly supports the embargo is dying off. Younger Cuban-Americans hold starkly different views, having come to see the sanctions as more damaging than helpful."" A June poll by Florida International University found that more than half of Cuban-Americans surveyed in Miami support an end to the embargo and a solid majority of them also favor restoring diplomatic relations with Havana. The Obama administration has not endorsed lifting the embargo, however. And it can only be lifted by Congress and as Mauricio Claver-Carone, Director of the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC, a lobby group in favor of keeping the embargo, points out, all seven Cuban-American legislators, including senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Bob Menendez, are against doing so. Still, the Cuban-American community is changing. ""The Cuban-American community is definitely different from that of several years ago,"" says Professor Mauricio Font, Director of New York University's Bildner Center for Western Hemisphere Studies. ""It has a large number of post-1990 immigrants who generally oppose the Castro regime but may want to keep the options to travel to Cuba. Furthermore, the 'historicos' who came to the U.S. in the late '50's and 60's are also experiencing attrition from aging."" The United States and Cuba have been at odds for over 50 years. Both sides have recently taken small steps towards a reconciliation. In 2011, President Barack Obama eased travel restrictions to the island for American citizens and last week, Cuba said it would be willing to cooperate with Washington to help fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. But, only time will tell if a new generation of young, engaged Latino voters can exert enough political heat to completely thaw a relationship frozen during the Cold War.","A new generation of Cuban-Americans is re-thinking the 50 year-old embargo .
Democratic politicians have endorsed ending the embargo ."
"Can a boss fire an employee he finds attractive because he and his wife, fairly or not, see her as a threat to their marriage? Yes, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled Friday. ""The question we must answer is ... whether an employee who has not engaged in flirtatious conduct may be lawfully terminated simply because the boss views the employee as an irresistible attraction,"" Justice Edward M. Mansfield wrote for the all-male high court. Such firings may not be fair, but they do not constitute unlawful discrimination under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, the decision read, siding with a lower court. An attorney for Melissa Nelson, the fired employee, said the decision was wrong. ""We are appalled by the court's ruling and its failure to understand the nature of gender bias,"" said Paige Fiedler, the attorney. ""For the seven men on the Iowa Supreme Court not to 'get it' is shocking and disheartening. It underscores the need for judges on the bench to be diverse in terms of their gender, race and life experiences."" Read the court's decision (PDF) The case concerns her client's employment as a dental assistant. Nelson worked for James Knight in 1999 and stayed for more than 10 years at the Fort Dodge business. Toward the end of her employment, Knight complained to Nelson her clothing was tight and ""distracting,"" the decision read. She denied her clothes were inappropriate. At one point, Knight told Nelson that ""if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing,"" the decision read. At another point, in response to an alleged comment Nelson made about the infrequency of her sex life, Knight responded: [T]hat's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it."" During the last six months of Nelson's employment, Nelson and Knight, both married with children, started sending text messages to each other outside of work. Neither objected to the texting. Knight's wife, who was employed at the same dental office, found out about those messages in late 2009 and demanded he fire Nelson. In early 2010, he did just that. In the presence of a pastor, Knight told Nelson she had become a ""detriment"" to his family and that for the sakes of both their families, they should no longer work together, the decision read. Knight gave Nelson one month's severance. In a subsequent conversation between Knight and Nelson's husband, Knight said Nelson had done nothing wrong and that ""she was the best dental assistant he ever had,"" the decision read. Nelson filed a lawsuit, contending that Knight fired her because of her gender. She did not say he committed sexual harassment. In response, Knight argued that Nelson was fired because of the ""nature of their relationship and the perceived threat"" to his marriage, not because of her gender. In fact, he said, Knight only employs women and replaced Nelson with another female employee. A district court sided with Knight; Nelson appealed. ""As we have indicated above, the issue before us is not whether a jury could find that Dr. Knight treated Nelson badly,"" read the high court's decision. ""We are asked to decide only if a genuine fact issue exists as to whether Dr. Knight engaged in unlawful gender discrimination when he fired Nelson at the request of his wife. For the reasons previously discussed, we believe this conduct did not amount to unlawful discrimination, and therefore we affirm the judgment of the district court.""","Melissa Nelson worked as a dental assistant for James Knight for more than 10 years .

"(CNN) -- I am black, though for most of my life, I've heard from various people that I wasn't. From children with skin the same color as mine saying that my normal speaking voice was somehow faked and that I spoke and therefore acted ""like a white man""; from a black woman who berated me for listening to the Beatles in my car because, in her words, their music ""wasn't yours""; from strangers and would-be acquaintances of varied races over several decades who openly wondered if I was something other than African-American because of an eclectic range of interests (Jewish novelists, New Wave French movies, Wallace Stevens' poetry, etc.) that didn't quite jibe with whatever was expected from African-Americans. There was even a liberal white teacher in my high school who suggested to me, straight-faced and with the very best of intentions, that if I was feeling out of place among my fellow black students I should just spend more time around what was then called ""the ghetto"" and learn how to speak as they would prefer; maybe even to adopt their speech as my own, so as to ....I don't remember the exact words, but I'm guessing it was to better embody whatever her idea of legitimate blackness was back in the mid-60s. If you came of age in mid- to late-20th century America when the civil rights movement gave way to growing consciousness of, and pride in being of African descent, the charge from within the black community that you were Not Black Enough was almost as wounding, even debilitating, as a racial epithet from a white person. Apparently, you can't even win a Super Bowl as a black quarterback without somebody slurring your authenticity. There were reports swirling around the Internet last week that Russell Wilson, signal caller for the defending NFL champion Seattle Seahawks, was being accused by some of his black teammates of being Not Black Enough. ""I don't even know what that means,"" Wilson, who has mixed-race parentage, told a press conference yesterday after his team rallied from a two-week losing streak to beat the Carolina Panthers. The great heavyweight boxer Joe Frazier went to his grave carrying the psychological scars from the often-vicious verbal abuse his great foil Muhammad Ali dealt him before each of their epic bouts, accusing Frazier of being an Uncle Tom and a ""white-man's champion."" And those were some of the milder (but no less dehumanizing) taunts that Ali later regretted and for which he repeatedly apologized to Frazier. Yet that dismal transaction represents one of the very few times in history that wrangling over whether somebody is or isn't Black Enough extended beyond the parameters of the African-American community itself. Lately, though, issues of black cultural authenticity have poked into broader public view; likely as part of the widening space for racial dialogue opened by Barack Obama's election as president, if not set off by it: Hard to remember now, but some black Americans questioned back in 2008 whether the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman could be considered as authentically rooted to the black American experience as those whose racial background went back generations on this country's soil. This fall, what was once a mostly insular discourse among black folks has gone even more public through two cozily familiar entertainment genres: the family sitcom and the campus comedy. The latter, ""Dear White People"" is writer-director Justin Simien's Sundance Film Festival sensation about culture clashes between white and black students (and among black students themselves) at a mythical Ivy League college. There's a black Big Man On Campus named (what else) Troy, who besides being the son of the dean of students is dating the daughter of the white university president. There's also a gay nerd-outcast named Lionel, who wears a retrograde Afro hairstyle so big as to be compared to a weather system, listens to Mumford & Sons, loves Robert Altman movies and, as he puts it, ""isn't black enough"" for either the black or the white students. The most radical character is a mixed-race young woman named Sam White, a rabble-rousing radio jock and aspiring filmmaker whose acerbically funny barbs aimed at genteel racial stereotyping at mythical Winchester University sets off a nationalist insurgency among the black students. Yet, as with Lionel, she carries a portfolio of seeming contradictions, such as a white lover and a preference for Ingmar Bergman's movies over Spike Lee's. Neither these characters nor their creator Simien insist on reconciling or dismissing such seeming incongruities. They're just thrown in as part of the movie's implicit challenge to the audience to look beyond whatever's obvious or shallow -- and not just in matters of race. I only wish it had been around 40 or 50 years ago. But America had too many other things to figure out about black people back then to dig out this elemental truth: That there are as many ways to be black as there are to be white. Or brown. It's a truth that ""Black-ish,"" the new ABC sitcom, pokes at with, so far, erratic results. There was much hype in advance about the ""innovative"" aspects of this series about African-American ad executive Andre Johnson, whose preference for being called ""Dre"" betrays his uneasiness with his fast-tracking lifestyle and whether sending his four children to elite Los Angeles schools disconnects his family from their black heritage, or, at least, those aspects of black heritage he thinks he's left behind in the working-class, predominantly black neighborhood where he grew up. ""Black-ish""â€”like Andre-- often tries too hard to make any real headway in this dilemma as it places its chief protagonist in such overbearing activities as combing school bus stops to find what he considers appropriate black friends for his eldest son, Andre Jr.; or devising elaborate African-based rituals in the backyard to mark his son's 13th birthday. All of which would be ""innovative"" territory only to those who can't recall all those decades of sitcoms featuring bumbling, clueless family patriarchs embarrassing themselves in front of their children. The most intriguing, revelatory moments in ""Black-ish"" are, thus, the smaller, more offhanded ones, most especially in the debut episode in which the two youngest children in the Johnson household say they can't see the significance of Barack Obama being the first black president because they've never lived in a time when there were white ones. Or when, during an episode about corporal punishment, ""Dre's"" multicultural office mates all agree they benefited from spankings when they were children, but abhor the idea of Dre spanking his own child. It is in these slivers of dialogue that we can see ourselves stumbling awkwardly toward new ways of looking at ourselves that are no longer tethered to superficial typing, whether self-imposed or otherwise. Some may wish calling out who is or isn't ""Black Enough"" would remain a covert operation. Others may prefer that all of us, within and beyond the black community, feel empowered enough to tell each other what we really mean. The future has a way of settling these arguments, one way or another.","Gene Seymour challenged for most of his life by other black people as ""not black enough""

"U.S. investigators are stepping up the pace of a corruption investigation into senior leaders of FIFA, even as the world soccer body is giving itself a clean bill of health, according to U.S. law enforcement officials. The FIFA ethics committee announced Thursday that it was closing its investigation into alleged corruption in the 2018 and 2022 bidding process that awarded the World Cup to Russia and Qatar, respectively. FIFA said its investigation found no corruption and has no reason to reopen the bidding process. Related: FIFA embroiled in World Cup civil war . But the FBI, which is leading the U.S. probe, isn't ready to do the same. Investigators are moving ahead with their probe, which could result in charges against senior FIFA officials, the U.S. law enforcement officials said. FBI agents based in New York are moving ahead with their 3-year-old investigation, which will likely benefit from the findings of a former U.S. prosecutor, Michael Garcia, who was hired by FIFA to do an internal probe. The FBI plans to seek access to Garcia's report, which FIFA hasn't yet released. The FBI declined to offer an official comment. Garcia on Thursday distanced himself from the FIFA ethics announcement, saying: ""Today's decision by the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber contains numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions detailed in the Investigatory Chamber's report.  I intend to appeal this decision to the FIFA Appeal Committee."" A U.S. law enforcement official said the probe is looking at a variety of alleged corruption issues, including the 2018 and 2022 bidding process.

"Nearly a year after receiving approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a new obesity drug will be available to certain patients by prescription, starting Tuesday. The FDA approved Belviq, an oral medication, in June 2012. The delay in availability was in part because the Drug Enforcement Administration needed to review the drug. People with a body mass index of more than 30 or a BMI of 27 with at least one weight-related condition, such as hypertension or Type 2 diabetes, are eligible for a prescription. Belviq, as the FDA pointed out in its statement announcing approval last year, is intended ""as an addition to a reduced-calorie diet and exercise."" Belviq, or lorcaserin hydrochloride, works by activating a serotonin receptor in the brain, which may help a person eat less and feel full after eating smaller amounts of food, according to the FDA. Belviq received approval about the same time as another weight-loss pill, Qsymia, which hit the market in September. Weight loss with both drugs is modest. Patients in clinical trials went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds on Qsymia; on Belviq, the average weight dropped from 220 to 207. In trials, 47% of patients without Type 2 diabetes lost at least 5% of their body weight on Belviq, according to the FDA. By comparison, 23% of patients treated with a placebo lost at least 5% of their weight. In people with Type 2 diabetes, 38% of patients on Belviq lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared with 16% on a placebo. At the time of approval, the FDA said Belviq's manufacturer, Arena Pharmaceuticals, would be required to conduct six post-marketing studies, including a long-term cardiovascular trial to assess the risk of heart attack and stroke. The most common side effects of Belviq in nondiabetic patients included headache, dizziness and fatigue, according to the FDA. In diabetic patients, side effects included pain and low blood sugar. In addition, some people taking medicines such as Belviq have reported heart valve problems, according to Eisai Inc., which markets the drug. ""It is not known if Belviq changes your risk of heart problems or of stroke, or death due to heart problems or stroke,"" according to the drug's website.

"Befitting its status as a fast-growing oil exporter, for Nigeria this week was to be a coming out party of sorts, as it hosts the 24th World Economic Forum on Africa. More than a thousand academic, business, civil society and political leaders are supposed to gather in Abuja, Nigeria's capital city, beginning on Wednesday, to discuss ""inclusive growth and job creation."" Conflicting with this image of an emerging regional economic powerhouse, just two days before the start of the World Economic Forum meeting, Nigeria is in the international headlines for all the wrong reasons: Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, a militant Islamist organization, released a video on Monday claiming responsibility for kidnapping more than 270 schoolgirls in northern Nigeria last month. The Boko Haram leader explained that the girls should not be attending school and should instead get married. He also threatened to sell the girls in the marketplace because, he said while laughing, ""Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women."" That statement, coming the day after Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan held a nationally televised ""media chat"" in which he vowed to rescue the girls, highlights Boko Haram's growing power in the country, as well as the government's relative inability to stop the group's attacks. If Boko Haram's growing insurgency isn't halted in Nigeria, it threatens to jeopardize the  largest economy in Africa and the some $100 billion in oil revenue the country generates every year. Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" has been at war with the Nigerian state for years. Founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf, a member of the short-lived ""Nigerian Taliban,"" it is predominantly focused on attacking the Nigerian government and implementing Taliban-style Sharia law. Yusuf was killed in 2009 while he was in police custody. There is no doubt that Boko Haram is a growing threat to Nigerians, but to what extent is it also a threat to Western interests? So far not much, although that could change. In the 12 years since its creation, Boko Haram has attacked an international target only once, when it bombed the United Nations office in the Nigerian capital Abuja in August 2011. A year earlier, Shekau, the Boko Haram leader, had released a statement expressing solidarity with al Qaeda and threatening the United States, and Osama bin Laden was reportedly in direct contact with the group's leaders. However, al Qaeda has never formalized any kind of partnership with Boko Haram. That said, the group has received some funding from the North African al Qaeda affiliate, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM; the exact numbers are unknown, but it is estimated that AQIM has accumulated $90 million, much of it from kidnappings. 6 reasons why the world should demand action . The United States is sufficiently worried about anti-Western terrorism in Nigeria that on Friday the State Department released a warning to Americans traveling in and to Nigeria that ""groups associated with terrorism"" may be planning an attack on a Sheraton hotel in Lagos, the country's commercial center. Though Lagos has never been attacked by Boko Haram, recent bombings in Abuja -- the first in two years -- show that militants are increasingly turning to targets outside their home base in Nigeria's northern territories. To combat the growing threat of Boko Haram, the President placed the northern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe under a six-month state of emergency in May 2013; the state of emergency was extended for six more months in November. But despite the heightened presence of security forces in those states, the Boko Haram insurgency has worsened. Amnesty International reported on Saturday that more than 1,500 people were killed because of fighting between Islamist militant groups and the government in the first three months of 2014, a total greater than in all of 2013. Continuing this trend, 19 people were killed and more than 60 were injured in a car bombing in an Abuja suburb on Thursday. (No group has claimed responsibility for that bombing, but it occurred in the same area as a Boko Haram attack that killed at least 70 people on April 14.) Initially, Jonathan downplayed the Boko Haram threat, calling the situation ""temporary"" and arguing that the Nigerian security forces were winning the battle against the militants. But after international criticism and domestic outrage, Jonathan has called for an investigation into the mass kidnappings of the girls in April and has said he is open to receiving foreign assistance. Boko Haram: The essence of terror . Some of this assistance will be coming from the United States, with a U.S. official telling CNN that: ""You are going to see a focus on this in all three channels of government: diplomatic, intelligence and military."" Adding to the growing frustration within Nigeria over the abductions are reports that Patience Jonathan, Nigeria's first lady, bizarrely ordered the arrest of two of the leaders of the protests that had erupted after the kidnappings of the girls in April, and had even denied the kidnappings had taken place. Patience Jonathan's office has denied the reports, but she was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying, ""You are playing games. Don't use schoolchildren and women for demonstrations again.""","Boko Haram leader says it has kidnapped more than 200 girls in Nigeria .

"DES MOINES, Iowa (CNN) -- Orangutans and bonobos in one of North America's leading ape research centers are spending time high in their habitats to escape Iowa floodwaters, officials said Monday. Floodwaters encroach on the bonobo facility at the Great Ape Trust of Iowa. Water on the grounds of the Great Ape Trust of Iowa in Des Moines has been as high as 14 feet after flooding began last week. Research, including the future and origins of culture, language, tool use and language in ape species, was brought to a standstill, officials said. But at no time were the apes in danger. ""The parts that house the animals all have drains, and being wet is a part of their daily routine,"" said Al Setka, director of communications. Animals moved to the highest levels of their living quarters when they wanted to stay dry, the trust reported. The orangutan habitat is 30 feet high, and the bonobo one is 25 feet high, according to the trust's Web site. ""Today, we are just trying to finish cleaning out the living areas to give the apes access to all of their indoor space,"" Setka said Monday. The trust's Web site said the Des Moines facility, built in a former sand quarry, will be the largest in North America when it is completed.","Water has been as a high as 14 feet at Great Ape Trust of Iowa .

"The Supreme Court on Wednesday announced disturbing decisions on two important cases regarding marriage law, but the high court refused to create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. In striking down Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the court declared that the federal government can't define marriage as the union of one man and one woman for its own policies and laws but must accept whatever the states decide about marriage. The court's ruling, though, doesn't affect Section 2, which provides that no state is required to give effect to another state's recognition of same-sex marriages. The court got it wrong with DOMA. The justices ignored the votes of large, bipartisan majorities in Congress in 1996. It is absurd for the court to suggest that Congress doesn't have the power to define the meaning of words in statutes that Congress itself enacts. This is a serious loss for federalism and democratic self-government. We must work to reverse it -- and to defend the rights of all Americans to make marriage policy. In its ruling on California's Proposition 8 (which defined marriage in that state as the union of one man and one woman), the Supreme Court declared that the citizen group that sponsored the initiative didn't have standing to defend the state constitutional amendment that millions of Californians voted to pass. The only reason this jurisdiction question was an issue is because the governor and attorney general of California decided to not defend a law passed by the people. Although the government of California through inaction tried to silence the voices of Californians, the court didn't create a right to redefine marriage. Marriage laws in the states that tell the truth about marriage -- that it is a union of one man and one woman to provide children with a mom and a dad -- were not struck down. We must now work to protect marriage laws in 37 other states.","Ryan Anderson: Supreme Court's decisions on marriage law are disturbing .

"Egypt's military-backed government resigned Monday, adding new uncertainty to the nation's three years of upheaval. The government headed by Prime Minister Hazem Beblawi turned in its resignation to President Adly Mansour, state-run Nile TV reported. Mansour accepted the resignations and thanked the prime minister and his Cabinet for their service. ""The presidency greatly values the tireless efforts of Dr. Beblawi and members of the government at a pivotal moment in the nation's history,"" Mansour said in a statement. State media reported that Mansour is expected to appoint a transitional prime minister in the coming days who will be tasked with putting together a new Cabinet to manage state affairs until presidential elections in April. The resignations come as disorganized strikes ripple through the work force.  In recent weeks, doctors, low-ranking police officers, postal workers, transport workers and textile workers have all gone on strike for short periods of time. Analysts expect army chief Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi, who served as defense minister, to run for president.  The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has said it would support an El-Sisi candidacy. If he does run, El-Sisi would need to give up his post. But with no clear contender, his chances of winning the presidency are high. If elected, he will become the sixth military leader to rule Egypt since its independence. Egypt's government has been unsettled since a popular revolt toppled the 29-year rule of former strongman Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Mohamed Morsy, the former head of the Muslim Brotherhood's political arm, was elected president in 2012. Shortly after he winning, he resigned from the Muslim Brotherhood and its Freedom and Justice Party in an effort to show that he would represent all Egyptians. But he was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule, with opponents accusing him of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up after the coup and now face a variety of counts, including organizing attacks on Egyptian troops in the Sinai Peninsula and fueling ""sectarian sedition with the aim of igniting civil war in Egypt."" Supporters say the military-backed government that replaced Morsy has returned to the authoritarian practices of Mubarak.","Egypt's government has been in turmoil since 2011 .

"(CNN)Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year. ""There is no stronger bond between man and dog than that formed during war,"" Farthing said at the annual tribute show, which aired Sunday night on CNN's global networks. The star-studded event, held in New York at the American Museum of Natural History, honored the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2014 -- everyday people making extraordinary efforts to change the world. Of those 10, CNN's audience voted Farthing as the Hero of the Year. ""Wow, I am absolutely at a loss for words,"" Farthing said as he accepted the award. ""This is absolutely amazing. I would really like to thank everybody who voted for the Nowzad charity and what we do in Afghanistan and believing in us. And I would also like to thank all the other heroes in this room for doing what they do to make this world an absolute better place. Thank you guys for doing what you do. Thank you."" In addition to the $25,000 that each person receives for making the Top 10, Farthing will be awarded $100,000 for his cause. The inspiration for Nowzad Dogs came in 2006. When Farthing helped break up a dogfight in the town of Nowzad, Afghanistan, the Royal Marine sergeant didn't think much of it. The war-torn town was overrun with dogs. But when one of those dogs followed him back to base, it was hard to tell who rescued whom. ""As the troop sergeant, I was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job. ... But no one was doing that for me,"" Farthing said earlier this year. ""My time with this dog was a way of de-stressing, collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game."" After his tour ended, Farthing went through a difficult process to get Nowzad home to Britain. Realizing he wasn't the only one, he soon founded Nowzad Dogs to help other soldiers whose lives were turned around by the animals they befriended. Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in Afghanistan. The group's shelter and clinic in Kabul are staffed by 14 Afghan nationals, four of whom are trained veterinarians. The group spays and neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population. In turn, those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets. To date, Nowzad Dogs has reunited nearly 700 soldiers with the animals they adopted in Afghanistan. ""I know that the dog I looked after was my saving grace from the stress of conflict,"" Farthing said. ""And because of that initial bond, the work goes on: reuniting soldiers with their companions, tackling rabies and training veterinarians in Kabul. I would like to thank everybody for their support. We're making a difference for the Afghan people, the soldiers and one dog and cat at a time."" Celebrity presenters at the tribute show this year included actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Christina Hendricks, Taye Diggs, Rosie Perez, Uzo Aduba and John Leguizamo. Also appearing were comedian Kathy Griffin, musician Questlove of The Roots, Kelly Ripa of ""Live with Kelly and Michael"" and Morgan Spurlock of CNN's ""Inside Man."" The event included musical performances by Sheryl Crow and Trisha Yearwood. Yearwood performed her latest song, ""PrizeFighter,"" while Crow performed ""Wide River to Cross"" with CNN Hero Arthur Bloom and his MusiCorps Wounded Warrior Band. Musician Nick Jonas, actor Tyler James Williams and actress Quvenzhane Wallis were also on hand to present awards to remarkable ""young wonders"" who are doing their part to help change their communities.

Through Amazon Payments, anyone who wants to contribute can make a direct charitable donation to a Hero's designated nonprofit until December 31. Since 2007, the CNN Heroes campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com. It has also received more than 50,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. As part of their award package, each of the Top 10 CNN Heroes will also receive organizational training through the Annenberg Foundation, a global supporter of nonprofit organizations. All 10 Heroes will participate in customized versions of the Annenberg Alchemy program, tailored to help grow their individual organizations.

"The divisiveness of the abortion debate was on full display in the Texas statehouse Monday as SB1, also known as the fetal pain bill, was opened to public comment by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. Thousands began lining up early in the morning, and the testimony was expected to last more than 16 hours. The measure seeks to ban abortions after 20 weeks of gestation, the point at which some claim fetuses begin to feel pain. Republican state Sen. Bob Deuell acknowledged that there are conflicting opinions in the medical community about fetal pain but remains a firm supporter of the bill.  ""Are we willing to take a chance that a baby at 20 weeks can feel pain? There was little to no middle ground in the debate. Those in favor of abortion rights accused Republicans of creating a bill based on religion rather than science. Anti-abortion activists accuse the other side of using personal liberty to justify infanticide. Throughout the day the committee called upon dozens of speakers, seating those with opposing views right next to each other. For anti-abortion activists such as Lady Teresa Toms, the bill doesn't go far enough. ""God says, 'I knew you before you were even knitted in your mother's womb.' That baby is a baby from the beginning.  There is no way that you need scientific evidence to know that that baby feels pain,"" she said. ""We have laws on the books now that say if you murder a pregnant woman you are charged with two murders ... so what is the difference here?"" But for Sarah Shimmer, the bill is an egregious violation of women's rights.  ""I am a Republican woman, but regardless of what my personal beliefs and experiences are, my personal reproductive choices do not give me the right to restrict other women."" In addition to banning abortions after 20 weeks, the bill would require clinics that provide abortions to become ambulatory surgical centers; would tighten guidelines for administering the drug RU486, which can terminate early pregnancies; and would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. Critics of the measure said it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas, denying access to many, while proponents say it would raise the standard of care for women. The initial bill failed on June 25 after a dramatic day and night in which state Sen. Wendy Davis, a Democrat, talked for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session. But Gov. Rick Perry called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again.  Perry's announcement that he would not be running for re-election fueled speculation about whether Davis can help rejuvenate the Texas Democratic party, which hasn't won a statewide election since 1994. Davis has not yet announced any plans and released a statement congratulating Perry on his lifetime of public service adding, ""I feel confident the next campaign will sort itself out in due time."" Planned Parenthood was quick to condemn the governor in a statement: ""Rick Perry has done more to hurt women than any governor in history. Perry's legacy is endangering women's health in order to score political points with the far-right tea party fringe."" The Senate committee is expected to vote on the bill after the House version of the bill is brought to the floor. That is expected to happen Tuesday, when the legislature reconvenes.","Thousands of people attend state Senate hearing on Texas abortion bill in Austin .

"When Harry S. Murphy arrived at the University of Mississippi in the fall of 1945, he was nervous. He landed at Ole Miss by way of the Navy's V-12 program, a wartime measure that allowed young men to take college classes, receive naval training and preparation to become officers. Murphy was black, but university officials did not know that. He had a white complexion and wavy brown hair. A military official checked the ""W"" box for white when Murphy enlisted in the Navy. This official unwittingly set Murphy on an entirely new path. Murphy explained that he had no intention to ""pass,"" and once at Ole Miss in Oxford, no one inquired about his race. ""I guess they just assumed I was white,"" Murphy said. If no one asked, why tell? Passing -- the choice to leave behind a black racial identity and present oneself as white -- allowed many African-Americans to navigate a racist society. In today's multiracial America, the decision to pass may seem unnecessary and unwarranted. But historically, erasing one's black identity was one of a limited number of avenues available to light-skinned African-Americans to secure a better life in the era of legalized segregation. Those who passed often reaped financial rewards, gained social privileges and enjoyed the fun of ""getting over"" by playing a practical joke on unsuspecting whites and winning a clandestine war against Jim Crow America. Murphy settled into campus life with ease. He was accepted as ""just another student."" He wore the college's colors as a member of the track team, made close friends with white students, danced with and dated white women and ate at local restaurants without incident. He was active on campus. Described by one classmate as ""arrogant"" and ""a loud talker,"" he even participated in a protest against Sen. Theodore Bilbo, the fanatical segregationist, when he spoke at Ole Miss while Murphy was on campus. When the military ended the V-12 program, Murphy transferred to Morehouse College in his hometown of Atlanta. University officials at Ole Miss never questioned why one of their ostensibly white students had made plans to attend a historically black college. Murphy's white skin functioned as a cloak and allowed him to pass as white at the University of Mississippi. But when James Meredith, another black student, attempted to integrate Ole Miss in 1962, it ignited widespread riots across the campus. Ole Miss prided itself on 114 years as a lily-white institution. Murphy observed the violent resistance to integration and declared, ""they're fighting a battle they don't know they lost years ago."" Once at Morehouse, Murphy returned to life as a black man. He later entered the printing business and moved to New York. Harry S. Murphy told his story to the press and gave readers a rare and intimate look at the lived experience of passing. But he was not the only African-American enlisted man whose military records identified him as ""white"" or ""Caucasian."" This type of temporary passing flourished during the Jim Crow era. Murphy's story appears to be one of levity and laughter, of exposing the absurdity of racial categories, and poking fun at erroneous beliefs in racial purity and white supremacy. But his story ends in tragedy. Murphy committed suicide at 63 in New York in 1991. We will never know why he took his own life. There is no evidence to link Murphy's death to any conflict that he may have had about his racial identity. But still, his suicide leads us to wonder about the personal and psychological losses, in addition to the gains, associated with passing. The history of passing offers a richer understanding of lives lived along the color line. But this history is never complete. It remains shadowy and blurred.

"Washington (CNN) -- There is an old joke in the Middle East that goes like this: One of Hosni Mubarak's advisers finally gets the courage to say, ""Mr. President, maybe it's time to think about your farewell address to the Egyptian people."" Mubarak looks at the adviser and asks, ""Why? Where are they going?"" In reality, Mubarak got the message loud and clear. Now, this leader, who for decades has been not just the symbol of Egypt but a dominant voice in the Middle East, will be leaving, and nobody is sure what will emerge in his wake. The effects will be felt not just in the Middle East but back in the United States. Today, the U.S. has less leverage in the region than ever before. At talks last month in Istanbul, Turkey, Iran showed the U.S. and its allies that it will remain defiant on its nuclear program in the face of tough sanctions. Lebanon is in the throes of a dangerous game of brinksmanship that threatens to send the country back into civil war after Hezbollah, supported by Syria and Iran, brought down the U.S.-backed government of Prime Minister Saad Hariri and installed billionaire businessman Najib Mikati as its choice for the job. In Yemen, a strongman president has been ejected, but he was also key to U.S. anti-terror efforts in the country that harbors an active and threatening subset of al Qaeda. Reform in the Middle East was an important item at the outset for the Obama administration. President Obama received international goodwill upon taking office, for simply not being President George W. Bush. He flew to Cairo early in his tenure and gave a much-watched speech to offer a ""new era"" in U.S. relations with the Arab and Muslim world. That was the high point. Although it came into office hoping to seduce the region rather than fight it, the Obama administration has not delivered on the tantalizing promises it made since taking over, not only to show progress on solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but to encourage democratic reform. Change in the region comes not from his encouragement but from the disaffected taking matters into their own hands. These dashed expectations Obama has created in the region are not just disappointing; they have hurt U.S. credibility in the region and have had diplomats and Middle East experts scratching their heads about just what Obama's vision for the region is. This troubled region has always looked to the U.S. to help in times of crisis. Now, countries like Turkey and Qatar, whose interests don't always align with Washington's, are taking the lead. While its influence on big-ticket issues in the region is declining, the U.S. has redoubled efforts to tackle their root causes, such as poverty, hunger and disenfranchisement of women. These are the same ills that prompted Tunisians to take to the streets, with people in the neighborhood nipping at their heels. Sensing the winds of change in the region, the Obama administration has been engaged in a robust debate over the past few months about whether to elevate the issue of reform. The answer was delivered in a speech last month in Qatar by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in which she warned Arab leaders that unless they reform and address economic and social frustrations, their regimes would ""sink into the sand."" The fall of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Tunisia and the events in Egypt caught U.S. officials off-guard and brought that debate to critical mass. For the first time in history, the U.S. has broken with authoritarian Arab allies. The events in Egypt have leaders of other pro-U.S. countries in the region rightly concerned about what will happen if demonstrations take place in their countries and whether they can count on America's loyalty. The Obama administration is trying to send the message to these countries -- but not necessarily their leaders -- that they can count on American loyalty. For years, a game ensued in which the U.S. called for reform and Arab leaders resorted to cosmetic and ad hoc changes to placate Washington, which accepted the meager gestures in the hopes they would lead to further changes. That game is over. Obama's decision to break with Mubarak, a critical U.S. ally in the Mideast, serves as a warning to Arab allies that they too are expendable and their reactions to U.S. calls for reform in the future must be met more seriously. Although the U.S. has finally found its footing on the reform issue, its aspirations of restarting Mideast peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians may be stalled indefinitely. Mubarak was an anchor of U.S. policy of stability in the region. The twin pillars of that policy -- support for pro-American regimes that share U.S. security interests and the pursuit of Israeli-Arab peace -- are now on shaky ground. Israel will probably conclude that if such entrenched Arab regimes can fall, making peace with a deeply divided Palestinian movement is anything but a sure bet. Israel is keeping a wary eye on developments in Egypt with fears that an Islamic takeover there would end three decades of cooperation between the two countries. The U.S.-brokered Camp David accords, signed by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1978, ended a generation of hostilities between the two nations and forged a relationship that has endured, in part, because of the stability of the Mubarak regime -- which came to power after Sadat was assassinated in 1981 -- and in spite of deep animus among rank-and-file Egyptians toward Israel. Eli Shaked, Israel's ambassador to Egypt from 2003 to 2005, predicted that if the Mubarak regime falls, a new Islamist regime, hostile to Israel and Western nations, will replace it. ""There will be no democracy in Egypt,"" Shaked said. ""If there will be democratic elections in Egypt in the summer or in the very near future, (they) will be the first and last democratic elections in Egypt."" While he recognizes that the causes of the upheaval in Egypt lie in economic and social strife, Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu said he is concerned that ""there is a possibility that an organized force will take advantage of the situation."" A new Egyptian regime probably will affect relations with Hamas, which controls the Palestinian territory sandwiched between Israel and Egypt, and may play up the harsh criticism among many sectors in Egyptian society toward Israeli policy. But some terrorism experts believe that extremist voices are being drowned out by the chants of the protesters in Cairo. CNN analyst Paul Cruickshank wrote that al Qaeda's support base, ""already severely shaken by its barbaric excesses in Iraq and biting criticism from fellow jihadists, could narrow yet further."" ""The televised scenes of secular, middle-class youngsters and Egyptians from all walks of life courageously and largely peacefully challenging the regime of President Hosni Mubarak have been transmitted onto tens of millions of television screens across the Arab world and have captured the imagination, providing vastly more attractive role models for young Arabs, whose hopes for too long have been strangled by political, economic and cultural sclerosis,"" he wrote. U.S. officials feel that the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's main Islamic political organization, has been very sophisticated in its handling of the people's revolt. The group deliberately stayed out of the fray in the early days of the protests, allowing other Egyptians to lead the charge for fear Mubarak would cite fears of extremist activity in cracking down on the demonstrators. Carrie Rosefsky Wickham, an associate professor of political science at Emory University and author of ""Mobilizing Islam: Religion, Activism and Political Change in Egypt,"" notes that the Brotherhood is an umbrella organization that encompasses different views and trends. Though technically illegal, the group does have a presence among the masses, but it is no longer the defiant anti-system movement it was in the past. The key question is whether the Brotherhood will continue to exercise self-restraint when the Mubarak regime falls. Rosefsky believes it will, arguing that the Brotherhood is less interested in seizing power and calling the shots than it is in spreading its message and influencing policy. Other experts believe the Brotherhood will grab power if given the chance. It is unclear to what extent established institutions of Egypt and other countries will be willing and able to change and open enough political space for viable oppositions to flourish. The future of U.S. policy and interests in the region will largely depend on who ends up in power, not just in Egypt but in the host of other countries on the verge of transformation. In a doomsday scenario, extremist Islamic factions in Egypt, Tunisia and even Jordan could come to power, killing critical diplomatic and military relationships, forcing the closing of the Suez Canal and allowing Iran fill the vacuum. That could even trigger a most dangerous war between Israel and Iran. Nobody expects that worst-case nightmare to come through, however. Regardless of the outcome, the Obama administration has concluded that it must try to be on the right side of history, which is seems to be the catchphrase of the week for Middle East analysts. Supporting the status quo could embolden leaders to hold on, possibly becoming even more oppressive. That could give way to a permanent resistance that creates even more pressure for chance, further radicalizes the Arab street and creates even more anger at the United States. This tectonic shifts taking place in the region have altered the American role in the Middle East indefinitely, if not forever. For the first time in decades, the U.S. is in uncharted waters in the proverbial boat without a paddle. There is certain fatalism to it all, with the U.S. gradually accepting the hard reality that it can only be driven by events rather than helping to drive them. The hope is that the whoever the new leaders of the Middle East are, they will look to Washington as a partner. When asked how the U.S. will pick up the pieces in the region, one senior official simply said, ""We will call whoever is in charge.""","Nobody is sure who will fill Hosni Mubarak's place when he steps down as Egypt's president .

"Criticism covered the French Foreign Minister's Facebook page and an air of disappointment hovered over much of Tehran just hours after word came that Iran and the world powers had failed to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear program. ""We thought we were going to have good news,"" said Houman, a 24 year-old Iranian actor who has been following the talks. ""We were hopeful both sides were going to reach a compromise. We were disappointed when it didn't happen."" Read more: U.S. isn't 'stupid' on Iran, says Kerry . The Sunday blues in Tehran were in stark contrast to the palpable surge of optimism here 48 hours earlier. On Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said a ""framework"" for a deal had been agreed to. When all six foreign ministers representing the P5+1 -- the U.S., UK, France, Russia, China and Germany -- announced plans to fly to Geneva and join the marathon talks, many Iranians felt an agreement on the first stage of a broader deal was near. ""I really thought there was going to be a deal, but all of a sudden it fell apart,"" said taxi driver Alireza Hashemi. The talks in Geneva were held behind closed doors with remarkable secrecy. Two U.S. administration officials told CNN that under a potential deal, Iran would halt enriching uranium to 20% -- a key step on the path to a nuclear weapon -- and render unusable most of its existing stockpile of higher enriched uranium. But rumors and reports swirled about possible divisions among the P5+1 countries -- with some members pushing for Iran to offer more, including a guarantee not to activate its heavy water reactor in Arak. What ultimately spoiled an agreement remains unclear, but many Iranians took to social media to blame French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. Shortly after arriving in Geneva, Fabius warned against signing a ""sucker's deal"" with Iran and told a French radio station: ""It is necessary to take fully into account Israel's security concerns."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the proposed agreement a ""bad deal for peace,"" and said: ""Iran is not required to take apart even one centrifuge. But the international community is relieving sanctions on Iran for the first time after many years. Iran gets everything that it wanted at this stage and pays nothing."" Read more: Why U.S. and Israel are split on Iran deal . Suddenly, due to ordinary Iranians' anger with Fabius, it seemed the U.S. government was no longer public enemy number one in Tehran.

"(CNN) -- The Tony Awards don't usually match the drama of the Oscars, but the 2014 edition at New York's Radio City Music Hall did deliver surprises and buzzworthy moments Sunday. Bouncing Hugh Jackman . If you are baffled by Hugh Jackman's prolonged bouncing during the Tony Awards opening sequence, you might want to watch online video of musical actor Bobby Van performing ""Take Me to Broadway"" in the 1953 movie ""Small Town Girl."" You'll then understand what inspired Jackman to hop, skip and jump from the red carpet, through the backstage and then onstage where he sang ""I Love the Tonys."" 'Music Man' rap . Jackman must have spent a lot of time researching 1950s musicals while preparing to host the 2014 Tonys. He revived the opening number from ""The Music Man,"" but turned it into a rap song. Hip-hop artists LL Cool J and T.I. joined Jackman for an unconventional performance of ""Rock Island."" ""Hands in the air, everybody on your feet,"" LL Cool J shouted as a drum beat produced by Questlove played. ""First Hip Hop performance on #thetonyawards w/@troubleman31 @thehughjackman,"" LL Cool J tweeted. Judging from Twitter reactions, many viewers loved it, some didn't, while others were just left puzzled. 'Denzel, Denzel, Denzel' A hint of sour grapes emerged from ""A Raisin in the Sun"" director Kenny Leon even though his show carried home three Tonys on Sunday night. Leon, who won for best direction of a play and best revival of a play, acknowledged backstage that he believed his lead actor, Denzel Washington, should have gotten a best actor nomination. ""Yes, Denzel was snubbed,"" Leon told reporters. Washington, who owns two Academy Awards for film work, is the ""anchor"" of the Broadway production, Leon said in his acceptance speech. ""Denzel, Denzel, Denzel. He's truly a theater inspiration."" Leon did find some solace when Sophie Okonedo, whom he called his show's ""glue,"" was given the Tony for best actress in a featured role in a play. ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" which first ran on Broadway in 1960, was the first Broadway play written by an African-American woman -- Lorraine Hansberry. 'All the Way' with LBJ . If Denzel Washington had been nominated, he would have faced Bryan Cranston. The ""Breaking Bad"" actor's ability to bring complex characters to life earned him a best actor Tony for his stage portrayal of former President Lyndon Johnson in ""All the Way."" The Tony might find a place of honor next to the three Emmys that Cranston won for his TV role of teacher-turned-meth dealer Walter White. Cranston wouldn't say backstage if he would reprise his LBJ role in author Robert Schenkkan's follow-up play ""The Great Society."" ""Thank you for electing LBJ once again,"" producer Jeffrey Richards said as he accepted the best play Tony for ""All the Way."" Tony history made . Audra McDonald made Broadway history when she won the Tony for best lead actress in a play for her portrayal of blues legend Billie Holiday in ""Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill."" McDonald's sixth Tony made her the first person to win in four different acting categories. ""I want to thank my mom and my dad up in heaven for disobeying the doctor's orders and not medicating their hyperactive girl and finding out what she was into instead and pushing her into the theater,"" McDonald said in her acceptance speech. She also paid tribute to women who paved the way for her success. ""I'm standing on Lena Horne, I'm standing on Maya Angelou, Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee and, most of all, Billie Holiday. You deserved so much more than you were given when you were on this planet. This is for you, Billie."" ""Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill"" -- billed as ""an evening filled with personal tales of difficult choices, bad breaks, worse men and some of the most glorious songs ever written"" -- also won the Tony for best sound design of a play. 'This is crazy pants!' What's a Tony Awards show without lots of Neil Patrick Harris? The actor who hosted the broadcast the previous four years got plenty of screen time Sunday night, including 90 seconds to accept the Tony for best actor in a leading role in a musical. ""A year ago I was hosting the Tonys,"" Harris said. ""This is crazy pants!"" Harris was honored for his title role in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" a musical about a rock band led by a German transgender singer. Harris, who is known for his big musical numbers as a Tony host, did not disappoint when he performed a song from the show with the ""Tits of Clay"" band. ""Hedwig"" also won for best revival of a musical, and Lena Hall got a Tony for best featured actress in a musical. Hall's acceptance speech included a ""thank you"" to ""my soon-to-be born niece. I don't know her name is yet but she'll be born in October."" Two Carole Kings . Jessie Mueller not only won a Tony for best lead actress in a musical, but she got to sing with the woman she portrays in ""Beautiful -- The Carole King Musical."" ""Carole King, I never thought that I would get to sing with you once in my life -- let alone twice,"" Mueller said in her acceptance. ""You have taught me so much and you teach me so much every time I get up on stage. What you went through and to come out of it with kindness and love and forgiveness and pure heart. And you're just such an amazing woman."" King joined Mueller for part of her performance as a young Carole King. The show also won a Tony for best sound design of a musical, which went to Brian Ronan. Thanks to Mom for skydiving lessons . The Tony for best musical went to ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder,"" which also earned a best director Tony for Darko Tresnjak. ""I should thank so many people, but most of all, my mom literally taught me to jump out of airplanes,"" the director said in his acceptance speech. ""She fought during the Second World War and she was a skydiver in 1940's."" He then spoke for several seconds in his native Serbian language to his 87-year-old mother. ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder,"" which is based on the 1907 novel ""Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal,"" also won Tonys for best costume design of a musical and best book of a musical. Praise-shouting genie . James Monroe Iglehart might have earned the distinction of best acceptance speech dance. Iglehart, who sings and dances as the genie in ""Aladdin,"" erupted in joy after he was handed the Tony for best performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical. ""I know this is supposed to be the most, you know, dignified awards show of the season, but I have to do this,"" he said. ""This is a praise shout."" He then shouted ""hey"" and danced. Iglehart told reporters backstage that he and his wife would celebrate his Tony with dinner at McDonalds, saying it keeps them grounded.","Hip-hop artists LL Cool J and T.I. joined Hugh Jackman for an unconventional performance .

"A group of 14 women jailed for protests in support of Egypt's ousted president will soon be free, after an Alexandria court revised their 11-year sentences, state news reported. The women had been sentenced Wednesday -- along with seven minors facing juvenile detention -- on charges of gathering, thuggery and weapons possession at a demonstration in support of former President Mohamed Morsy. The sentence sparked wide criticism of the Interior Ministry and the judiciary's handling of cases involving those detained for  publicly backing Morsy, who has been in custody since being pushed out in July. Police arrest head of arrested women's defense team . It also set the stage for Saturday's appeals hearing in Alexandria. That ended with the court's decision to release the 14 women, giving them instead suspended one-year sentences, according to Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper. The appeals court also acquitted the detained girls, who ranged in age from 15 to 17. Egypt has been mired in political and social turmoil since massive, peaceful protests in 2011 -- amid the broader Arab Spring movement that targeted many entrenched leaders in the Middle East -- led to the exit of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy took power as Egypt's first popularly elected president in June 2012. But his time was marked by continued unrest, much of it targeting him and the Muslim Brotherhood, the once-banned Islamist organization that he once led. Conditions in the North African country have not improved significantly since the military forced off Morsy and assumed control. Authorities have taken various steps to quell the social unrest, including legislation passed last month barring unauthorized protests. These efforts have most noticeably targeted Morsy supporters, though authorities have increasingly cracked down on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy.

"East Coasters, if intense rains and strong winds ruin your Fourth of July holiday, you will have Arthur to blame. That's the name of the first named storm of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season. Arthur is now churning off the coast of eastern Florida. As of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the center of Tropical Storm Arthur was stalled about 90 miles east-southeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, and 95 miles north-northwest of Freeport in the Bahamas. But Arthur isn't expected to remain stationary for long, with the National Hurricane Center predicting it will drift northwest before turning north on Wednesday. The system is expected to go east of northeast Florida sometime Wednesday, before moving north and possibly affecting the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Thursday night. By then, it may have changed to Hurricane Arthur, if it gets stronger, as forecasters expect. To reach that status, the storm must have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Already on Tuesday, parts of eastern Florida, from Fort Pierce to Flagler Beach, were under a tropical storm watch given the possible combination of powerful winds and heavy rains. Grand Bahama Island saw sustained winds of 47 mph and a gust of 61 mph on Tuesday, according to the Miami-based hurricane center. Such winds may be the least of the worries for the Caribbean island chain, parts of which could end up drenched in 6 inches of rain through Wednesday. Arthur is expected to produce significant, but slightly less, rainfall in the United States. The hurricane center forecast calls for as much as 5 inches through Wednesday in Florida, with 1- to 3-inch totals more likely. Other parts of the East Coast also are expected to be affected as the storm churns north. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the fact that the Outer Banks, a string of barrier islands, is hard to get onto and off of may make the situation difficult for those who are planning to spend their July Fourth holiday there. The islands are low and rain could easily wash onto the roads, making them impassable even before the eye of the storm makes landfall, he said. All preparation for the storm should be done as soon as possible, he stressed. On Tuesday afternoon CNN affiliate WWAY in Wilmington, North Carolina, was asking its readers to take a survey measuring how concerned they are about Arthur. Will it make them ""batten down the hatches"" or be just ""another day at the beach,"" or does it matter, ""as long as it's gone in time for fireworks""? There's also an option for ""don't know/don't care."" Lee Nettles, the executive director of the Outer Banks Visitors Bureau, said his office hasn't received any panicked or alarmed calls from anyone. ""You take every storm warning seriously,"" he said. ""But, for the most part, folks aren't overly concerned."" After hitting the Carolinas, the system is likely to turn northeast, forecasters said. By then, it could drench cities like Washington, New York and Boston, But it's unclear just how torrential the downpour might be or how it could affect Independence Day festivities, CNN's Myers said. The good news is that none of the current National Weather Service forecasts for those three cities are predicting winds in excess of 10 mph through Thursday, at least. But there is a better than average chance that heavy rain could hit them all. Here's a look at what you need to know about Independence Day .","Tropical Storm Arthur is stationary off Florida; expected to head up the coast later .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor asked her husband to call a priest to her hospital bedside ""to read her the last rites"" Sunday, according to her publicist. Gabor, 93, is ""in very serious condition"" at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt. ""It's a sad time for them right now,"" spokesman John Blanchette said Sunday. The actress has been hospitalized for most of the past month since breaking her hip in a fall from bed on July 17. Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband. She was rushed to the hospital from her Bel Air, California, home Friday night, Blanchette said. She underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot that night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, he said. Gabor had just returned home from the hospital on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt.  The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","NEW: Gabor is in ""very serious condition,"" her husband says .

"(CNN) -- Robin Beaton found out last June she had an aggressive form of breast cancer and needed surgery -- immediately. Robin Beaton, 59, found out just days before her mastectomy that her insurance provider would not cover the procedure. Her insurance carrier precertified her for a double mastectomy and hospital stay. But three days before the operation, the insurance company called and told her they had red-flagged her chart and she would not be able to have her surgery. The reason? In May 2008, Beaton had visited a dermatologist for acne. A word written on her chart was interpreted to mean precancerous, so the insurance company decided to launch an investigation into her medical history. Beaton's dermatologist begged her insurance provider to go ahead with the surgery. ""He said, 'This is a misunderstanding. This is not precancerous. All she has is acne.' ... He said ,'Please don't hold up her cancer surgery for this,' "" Beaton, 59, said as she testified at a House subcommittee hearing on the terminations of individual health policies by insurance companies. Still, the insurance carrier decided to rescind her coverage. The company said it had reviewed her medical records and found out that she had misinformed them about some of her medical history. Beaton had listed her weight incorrectly. She also didn't disclose medication she had taken for a pre-existing heart condition -- medicine she wasn't taking when she originally applied for coverage. ""I didn't know what to do. The hospital wanted a $30,000 deposit. I was by myself. I didn't have that kind of money,"" Beaton said through tears. ""Can you imagine, having to walk around with cancer growing in your body? With no insurance. It's the most terrifying thing in the world to not have anybody to turn to or anywhere to go."" Beaton, who worked as a registered nurse for three decades, charged that the insurance company ""searched high and low"" to pull out anything on her so that they would not have to pay for her surgery. Beaton turned to Texas Rep. Joe Barton for help. Barton said his staff went to work, but the insurance company, he said, was ""unyielding."" Barton appealed to the company's president, who promised to investigate personally. The president called Barton back within four hours and said the coverage would be reinstated. Beaton underwent surgery in October, but by then her tumor had grown from two to three centimeters to seven. She had to have all the lymph nodes removed in her arm. Beaton is one of more than 16 million Americans who have individual health insurance policies. She and two others testified Tuesday about their experiences with insurance rescission. The witnesses charged that insurance applications are purposely long and confusing, and that companies look for any discrepancy to avoid covering expensive treatments. The hearing, which was a result of a yearlong congressional investigation in the individual insurance market, examined ""post-claims underwriting,"" a process by which insurance carriers cancel an individual's policy after providers submit claims for medical services they received. ""Overall, what we found is that the market for individual health insurance in the United States is fundamentally flawed,"" said Rep. Henry Waxman, the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. One of the witnesses, Wittney Horton, said her coverage was canceled after her carrier said she did not disclose that she had taken a drug prescribed for weight loss and because of her irregular menstrual cycle. Her carrier sent her a letter saying they would not have accepted her had they known she had ""polycystic ovaries,"" a condition she did not know she had. Peggy Raddatz testified on behalf of her brother, who was diagnosed with stage four non-Hodgkin's type lymphoma. In the midst of his chemotherapy treatment, his coverage was rescinded and he was not able to receive the stem cell transplant needed to save his life. Raddatz's brother was told his coverage was canceled for failing to disclose that, unknown to him, a doctor had once noted in his file that a CT scan showed a small aneurysm and some insignificant gallstones. Peggy Raddatz worked with the Illinois attorney general's office and eventually was able, after two appeals, to get her brother's coverage reinstated. Insurance companies argue rescissions are relatively rare, but Waxman said the practice saved the companies $300 million over the past five years. Waxman said he and the insurers agree the solution to the rescission problem is to pass comprehensive health reform legislation. The CEOs of Assurant Health, UnitedHealth Groups' Golden Rule Insurance Co. and WellPoint's Consumer Business also testified at the hearing. Don Hamm, the CEO of Assurant Health, said his company regrets the ""necessity of even a single rescission."" He said the company has a fair rescission investigation process: When the company becomes aware of a pre-existing condition that was not disclosed on a person's application, a senior underwriter reviews the information to determine if the omission was ""material"" to the underwriting decision. A manager verifies the analysis. If the omission was not material, the review is complete, but if it was, the application goes to a review panel, which includes a physician. The panel evaluates the information and makes a decision. The amount of the claim is not revealed to the panel, Hamm said. There also are multiple opportunities for a person to appeal -- including by means of an independent review panel, he said. Richard Collins, the CEO of Golden Rule, noted that rescission ""has long been recognized by the laws of virtually every state."" ""Rescission is uncommon, but unfortunate, and a necessary recourse in the event of material, and at times intentional or fraudulent, misstatement or omission on an insurance application,"" he said. Less than one-half of 1 percent of individual insurance policies were terminated or rescinded, he said. Brian Sassi, president and CEO of Consumer Business, said WellPoint is proposing a set of rescission regulations with new consumer protections. ""In addition, the health insurance industry has proposed a set of comprehensive and interrelated reforms to the individual health insurance market as a whole. The centerpiece of this proposal is the elimination of medical underwriting, combined with an effective and enforceable personal coverage requirement,"" he said. Members of the subcommittee grilled the CEOs on their rescission policies -- including the fact that some companies will not take on clients who have had insurance rescinded in the past -- but the companies maintained that rescission is not about cost. Asked if they would commit to never rescinding a policy unless it was intentionally fraudulent, all of the CEOs said no, noting that a commitment like that does not coincide with the state laws and regulations they follow. ""Doesn't it bother you that people are going to die because you insist on reviewing a policy that somebody took out in good faith and forgot to tell you that they were being treated for acne?"" Barton asked the panel of CEOs. ""Yes sir, it does, and we regret the necessity that that has to occur even a single time, and we've made suggestions that would reform the system such that that would no longer be needed,"" Hamm replied. CNN's Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","Robin Beaton's insurance rescinded her policy days before her mastectomy .

"Accused Ohio school shooter T.J. Lane was in juvenile court Tuesday for a pretrial hearing as prosecutors moved to limit the release of more information about the suspect. Seated with his attorney and positioned in front of his grandparents, Lane, 17, wore a beige shirt and appeared to address the court politely during its ongoing deliberations over last month's shooting at Chardon High School. He is charged with three counts of aggravated murder, two of attempted aggravated murder and one of felonious assault. Authorities released police reports and court records last week that showed Lane had a troubled childhood. When he was 15, Lane was charged with juvenile assault for putting his uncle in a choke hold and punching him in the face, according to an incident report from the Geauga County Sheriff's Office.  His parents also had both been charged with domestic violence against each other, according to court documents. His father also served prison time for assaulting a police officer and was charged in an assault on another woman. At the time of the shooting, Lane was living with his grandparents. Prosecutors filed a motion Monday to block the media from access to other records related to Lane, CNN affiliate WOIO reported. Prosecutors argued that Lane was already under ""public scrutiny"" and the release of more information ""would only magnify the situation for him and his relatives,"" the affiliate reported. A probable cause hearing is scheduled for April 3, prosecutors said. A  funeral mass for 16-year-old Demetrius C.

"Washington (CNN) -- A senior administration official defended President Barack Obama on Wednesday as a decisive commander in chief ahead of next week's release of a book that reveals an administration deeply divided over U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. ""Obama's Wars,"" by veteran Washington journalist Bob Woodward, describes a frustrated president who urgently sought an exit plan, only to be provided with options that involved increased U.S. troop levels, the Washington Post reported Wednesday. Woodward is associate editor of the newspaper. Woodward takes readers behind the scenes in the Obama White House through accounts of closed-door strategy sessions, private conversations, internal memos and hours of interviews with key players. ""This needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off and get out of Afghanistan,"" Obama is quoted as telling his aides as he agreed to a short-term escalation of 30,000 troops, according to the Post. ""Everything we're doing has to be focused on how we're going to get to the point where we can reduce our footprint. It's in our national security interest,"" Obama said, according to the newspaper. In an October meeting with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Obama said: ""I'm not doing 10 years. I'm not doing long-term nation-building. I am not spending a trillion dollars."" A senior administration official on Wednesday downplayed the rifts portrayed in the book, slated for release Monday. ""The president comes across in the review and throughout the decision-making process as a commander in chief who is analytical, strategic and decisive, with a broad view of history, national security and his role,"" the official told CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry. The official said Obama wanted concise answers to questions about the capacities of the Afghan government and whether a counterinsurgency strategy could be effective there. The official said Obama wanted to know exactly what kind of U.S. presence was required and what could realistically be achieved in the immediate future. Woodward reveals a president greatly at odds with top military advisers Gen. David Petraeus and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Woodward writes that dissent turned into name-calling on both sides, the Post reported. At one point, Petraeus felt shut out and told an aide that he considered Obama adviser David Axelrod a ""complete spin doctor."" Another key disclosure in Woodward's book is that the CIA is running a 3,000-strong Afghan paramilitary force. A U.S. official said the Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams were ""well-trained, effective Afghan special operations forces,"" which conduct secret operations against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Pakistan. A CIA spokesman would not comment on the paramilitary force. Pakistani officials denied that CIA-trained soldiers were operating on Pakistani soil. Among other revelations in Woodward's book, according to the Post: . -- The U.S. government was unprepared to deal with a nuclear terrorist attack on American soil. Obama told Woodward in an interview: ""When I go down the list of things I have to worry about all the time, that is at the top, because that's one where you can't afford any mistakes."" -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai was diagnosed as manic-depressive, Woodward said, citing U.S. intelligence reports. ""He's on his meds; he's off his meds,"" Woodward quoted U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry as saying. A spokesman for Karzai dismissed the allegations. ""About this allegation that the president was on medication for depression -- that is absolutely false, and this is part of a campaign against the president's personal integrity,"" said Waheed Omer. ""The president is absolutely safe, healthy and sound and doesn't take any medication for any illness."" CNN's Pam Benson, Reza Sayah and Atia Abawi contributed to this report.","The book reveals the CIA is running a 3,000-man Afghan paramilitary force .

"Arthur was holding steady as a tropical storm, not quite rising to the hurricane moniker Wednesday night. But it is poised to cause some holiday travel havoc. At 11 p.m. Wednesday, its maximum sustained winds were 70 mph,  3 mph shy of the hurricane category, the National Weather Service said. Arthur, the first named storm of the Atlantic tropical cyclone season, is churning up the East Coast and might be at its most dangerous Thursday as it grinds up against the North Carolina coast. So far, that is the only part of the country predicted to be hit with hurricane force winds, but the weather system also is causing problems farther north. Officials said Wednesday afternoon that the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular, normally held on July 4, will be moved to Thursday because of the potential for bad weather. Arthur is expected to become a Category 1 hurricane off the North Carolina coast on Thursday, and although the eye might not hit land, the storm could create dangerous rip currents that day along the Outer Banks and Pamlico Sound, forecasters said. North Carolina's governor issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coast and sent this message to those who plan to hit the beaches: Stay out of the ocean. ""I don't want you to put at risk not only yourself but also people who may try to help you, especially our emergency operation workers,"" said Gov. Pat McCrory. ""Don't put your stupid hat on,"" McCrory said at the New Hanover County Emergency Operations Center, according to CNN affiliate WWAY. Late Wednesday, a mandatory evacuation order was issued for Hatteras Island and a voluntary evacuation order went out to  Ocracoke Island. Some vacationers at Southern Shores, North Carolina, said they weren't too worried. ""We've been coming down here for 20 years,"" said Jim Stafford of Greenville, Pennsylvania, as he stood in front of the beachfront house where he's staying. ""We'll just see what happens."" When asked whether he was taking any precautions, Stafford said he planned to fill up the gas tank on his car ""just in case."" Track the storm . Strong winds could push water to the point where the underwater sandbars in front of North Carolina's beaches break, creating rip currents that would rush swimmers out to sea, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""There's no time for you to react. That's why you can't be there at all,"" Myers said, describing a danger area from Wilmington north to Nags Head. ""This is not a landfall-problem hurricane. This is a rip-current-problem hurricane,"" he added. As for Independence Day, the storm could send rain to the Washington area during the day, but forecasters said it shouldn't spoil most of Friday night's festivities -- including a colossal fireworks show on Washington's National Mall -- as it veers away from land. PBS is planning to broadcast the pyrotechnics blossoming over the Reflecting Pool live via 20 cameras. Those wet roads . In Boston, officials said there's a chance of rain Thursday, so the city's music-and-fireworks event might not happen that day either, reported CNN affiliate WCVB. The fireworks could be rescheduled but not the concert by the Boston Pops, State Police Col. Timothy Alben said, according to WCVB. ""The rain is a factor for the orchestra,"" event organizer Rich MacDonald told the television station. ""If the rain is coming down hard enough that it is coming down into the Hatch Shell then it affects the instruments and these instruments are valuable and old."" Arthur could trigger the wrong kinds of bangs and booms on the roads leading up to the Fourth. It is the busiest week of summer travel, according to AAA. Most of those travelers will be going by car right around the time Eastern U.S. roads will get soaked. ""They are potentially staring down the barrel of a loaded gun,"" AAA spokeswoman Yolanda Cade said. Florida fireworks . Still a tropical storm Wednesday afternoon, Arthur was slowly creeping north off Florida's northern Atlantic coast, dumping rain there, the weather service said. The same Florida coast might be an ideal place to spend July Fourth, as Arthur should be far away from there by Friday and fireworks will burst over the beaches from Key West to Jacksonville. By late Saturday, Arthur will be gone from the U.S. coast, providing mostly pleasant weekend weather from Florida to Maine.

"When Jon Stewart gave Hillary Clinton a career aptitude test on the 'Daily Show' Tuesday night, her answers alluded to a presidential bid -- and she touched on the disintegration of a Middle East cease-fire she negotiated two years ago. The former Secretary of State, Senator, First Lady and Cabinet member told the Comedy Central host that she wants a home office. ""Do you have a favorite shape for that home office? Would you like it to have corners?"" he asked her. ""Fewer corners,"" said Clinton. It wasn't lost on the audience that she was referencing the Oval Office in the White House. In a web-only cut from the interview, she agreed with Stewart that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is overwhelming. Palestinians in Gaza are ""trapped by their leadership,"" said Clinton. ""Unfortunately it's a two-pronged trapping,"" she said.  ""They have leadership that is committed to resistance and violence and therefore their actions are mostly about how do we get new and better missiles to launch them at Israel instead of saying how we're going to help make your lives better."" Israel's Iron Dome defense system is capable of and successful at shooting Hamas-launched rockets out of the sky, but ""that can't be certain"" in defending Israelis from bombardment from Gaza, said Clinton, especially now that Hamas is reportedly sending drones over the border. Clinton pointed to the Muslim Brotherhood, and former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, as key allies in the negotiation process between Israel and Palestine that she helped spearhead as Secretary of State in November 2012. ""The Hamas leadership now feels somewhat trapped themselves because they had an ally with the Muslim Brotherhood,"" she said.  ""I negotiated the cease-fire with Morsi and Morsi was able to convince the Hamas groups to abide by it. He's gone."" Clinton said that the new, military-led regime in Egypt, which offered a cease-fire Tuesday that Israel accepted and Hamas rejected, sees Hamas as a ""danger.""  Clinton said Egypt's new President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sees Hamas as a ""source of instability and violence that can affect them in Sinai and beyond."" ""So they are trapped, and they're trapped I would argue first and foremost by leadership that doesn't really want to make the situation too much better because that gives them a lot of leverage over the poor people in Gaza,"" she said. Clinton used her third appearance on the show to promote her new book, ""Hard Choices,"" and Stewart cut her off a number of times. ""I think I speak for everybody when I say no one cares. They just want to know if you're running for President,"" he said. ""I was going to make an announcement,"" she said. ""But you kind of spoiled it."" ""It sounds to me like if I may, you've declared you're running for President,"" Stewart said. Stewart referred to two books; 'Clinton, Inc,' a forthcoming book by Daniel Halper, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, and 'Blood Feud' by Edward Klein, both of which are critical of her and the Clinton family. The host also touched on Clinton's testimony over the September 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead. ""If you were not running for President, all of this criticism -- there are two books out now that are exposes of the family, there are constant calls for testimony, there are constant parsing of words. If you stopped that tomorrow -- if you said, 'I am not running for President' -- it all stops. Do you agree or disagree?"" Stewart asked. Clinton, who has said journalism is now driven more by entertainment than fact-based reporting, said that ""if it all stopped,"" a lot of people would lose their jobs. Klein's book, which hinges on multiple anonymous sources to draw a story highly critical of Clinton, recently overtook Clinton's own memoir at the top of the New York Times Best Sellers list. ""I've been amazed at what a cottage industry it is,"" Clinton said. To that, Stewart replied -- referring to himself -- ""It's just these talking heads sitting around, picking out every little thing -- and making fun of it. It's not right."" 6 times Clinton sounded, acted like a candidate .","Palestinians in Gaza are ""trapped by their leadership,"" Clinton says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Jurors heard opening statements Tuesday in the murder trial of a teenager who is accused of gunning down a gay classmate execution-style in their Southern California junior high school classroom in 2008. Brandon McInerney, who was 14 at the time of the shooting, is being tried as an adult on charges of first-degree murder, use of a handgun and a hate crime, said Ventura County Chief Deputy District Attorney Mike Frawley. McInerney, now 17, allegedly shot 15-year-old Lawrence King, an eighth grader at E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California, twice while both were typing papers in a computer lab for their English class, authorities said. The trial is being held in Chatsworth, California, in neighboring Los Angeles County because the defendant successfully sought a change of venue in the high-profile case, Frawley said. King, an openly gay teenager, was seated in the middle of the classroom with two dozen students and their teacher when McInerney allegedly shot him in the back of the head, authorities said. McInerney managed to bring a handgun belonging to relatives inside the school, Frawley said. After the first shot, King fell to the ground, and McInerney allegedly stood over him and shot again, Frawley said. ""It was a coup de grace shot,"" Frawley said of the second shot. ""There were no words exchanged. He just pulled out the gun and did it,"" Frawley said Tuesday. ""The victim didn't even see it coming."" Both shots were at point-blank range, Frawley said. Friends said King was proud of being openly gay. He liked wearing jewelry and makeup to school, and he often wore high-heeled boots with the school uniform. He asked his teachers to call him Leticia instead of Larry. Some students bullied him, pupils said. King lived in a group home called Casa Pacifica, where workers said he started dressing like a girl. Other students said McInerney was also subject to some harassment because King had a crush on him and made it publicly known.","Lawrence King, 15, was shot in the back of the head in English class in 2008 .

"Senate Democrats on Monday offered a new proposal to extend the payroll tax cut before it expires at the end of the year, and President Barack Obama quickly urged Congress to help middle-class Americans by passing it. In a statement to reporters at the White House, Obama said failure to act would mean almost 160 million people would pay higher taxes next year, violating a pledge by Republican legislators against raising taxes. ""Keep your word to the American people and don't raise taxes on them right now,"" Obama said, arguing that extending the lower payroll tax rate enacted last year would help the nation's economic recovery. ""Now is the time to keep growing the economy, to keep creating jobs, to keep giving working Americans the boost that they need."" In reference to the GOP opposition to higher taxes, Obama asked: ""How could it be the only time there's a catch is when it comes to raising taxes on middle-class families?"" ""It doesn't make sense,"" the president added. Senate Republicans fired back immediately, with conservative Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah saying the Democratic plan had no GOP input and no chance of passing. ""It's hard for the majority to call this a compromise when the other side hasn't been involved,"" Hatch said in a statement, adding: ""With the long list of things Congress has to get done by the end of the year and the clock ticking, it's pretty mystifying that the majority is pursuing more political show votes that won't go anywhere."" The issue has become a showdown between Democrats led by Obama and Republicans in Congress over whether to increase taxes on the wealthy to give the rest of the country a tax break next year. Last week, Senate Republicans blocked progress on a Democratic plan that would assess a surtax of 3.25% on income over $1 million. The new proposal sponsored by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, contains a reduced version of that tax provision, down to 1.9%, and calls for it to expire after 10 years, according to a statement by the senator. ""It will be fully paid for with a mixture of spending cuts Republicans have already agreed to and a tiny, tiny surtax on the top two-tenths of 1% of American taxpayers,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, adding that ""in an effort to make our proposal more palatable to Republicans, we have conceded significantly to cut the tax on income above a million dollars and make it temporary."" In addition, the Democratic plan includes cutting the payroll tax paid by workers from the current rate of 4.2% to 3.1%. That would mean a family making $50,000 a year would save about $1,500, according to Democrats. If the tax cut is not extended, the rate would go up to 6.2% and cost that same family an additional $1,000 next year, Democrats say. However, the new Democratic proposal drops a provision in the measure defeated last week that would also expand the payroll tax cut to employers, Casey's statement said. Cutting out that provision drops the total cost of the measure to $180 billion from the $265 billion of last week's proposal, it said. In addition to revenue from the so-called ""millionaire's surtax,"" the new proposal would be paid for by increasing fees that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac charge mortgage lenders to guarantee repayment of new mortgage loans, Casey's statement said. The provision was discussed during negotiations by the congressional ""super committee"" that failed to reach a deficit reduction deal last month, and would raise $38.1 billion, according to Casey's statement. Democrats also included a provision from a Senate Republican measure that would prevent millionaires from receiving food stamps and unemployment assistance, a Senate Democratic aide said. Putting a 10-year ""sunset"" on the surtax for millionaires was a response to Republican criticism that the original proposal amounted to a permanent tax increase for a temporary economic stimulus plan, the aide added. Obama's statement noted that the American economy needs the continued benefits of the payroll tax cut, which puts more money into people's pockets. ""Although the unemployment rate went down last month, our recovery is still fragile, and the situation in Europe has added to that uncertainty,"" Obama said. ""And that's why the majority of economists believe it's important to extend the payroll tax cut. And those same economists would lower their growth estimates for our economy if it doesn't happen."" At the same time, he said, the reduced tax burden helped families pay bills and increased spending and hiring. Obama took aim at the Republican opposition to higher taxes on the wealthy, which undermined comprehensive deficit reduction negotiations this year. GOP negotiators have repeatedly rejected Obama's push to end Bush-era tax cuts on wealthy Americans. ""How can you fight tooth-and-nail to protect high-end tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and yet barely lift a finger to prevent taxes going up for 160 million Americans who really need the help?"" Obama asked. A top Senate Republican aide, who had not yet seen the Democratic proposal, criticized the broad outline because it still includes a tax increase on wealthy ""job creators."" Republicans oppose any kind of tax increase in their push to shrink the size of government, while the White House says raising the taxes of millionaires won't affect small business owners cited by Republicans as job creators who would be hurt by a larger tax burden. On Sunday, conservative Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said he believed the lower payroll tax rate set to expire at the end of the year would be extended, as sought by Obama. However, Coburn told ""Fox News Sunday"" that paying for it should include immediate cuts in spending, rather than a drawn-out approach that ends up only reducing additional spending in future years. ""Where is the backbone in Washington to actually pay for these extensions in the year in which the money is spent?"" asked Coburn, a prominent fiscal hawk. Last week, Senate Republicans prevented Democrats from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on their initial payroll tax cut extension measure, which was blocked on a 51-49 vote. The Democratic plan would have assessed a 3.25% tax on income over $1 million to pay for the proposal's cost. Taxpayers with an income of $50,000 would have benefited by $1,500 a year. A Republican alternative that would have frozen discretionary government spending and cut federal jobs, while also raising Medicare costs for Americans with incomes above $750,000 a year, also got blocked by opposition from both parties on a 20-78 vote. Despite the outcome of the votes, a softening of Republican opposition to extending the lower payroll tax rate raised expectations for eventual congressional approval of a compromise plan. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, last week agreed with Obama and Democrats that extending the payroll tax cut would help the economy by putting more money in the pockets of consumers. Boehner's comment broke from conservative GOP orthodoxy that contends the payroll tax cut enacted last year had failed to benefit the sluggish economic recovery. House Republican leaders have assembled their own proposal to extend the payroll tax cut in conjunction with other steps, but that plan faced opposition from conservative Republicans. Boehner has insisted that any extensions of tax cuts or other programs be paid for, and he outlined a list of spending cuts over 10 years to offset the impact on the deficit, according to House Republican aides. However, a group of fiscally conservative Republicans opposed the GOP leaders' plan because the offsetting spending cuts would take a decade to complete. Some Republicans worried about the political fallout for their party if the public holds them responsible for holding up middle-class tax relief. ""If we don't extend the payroll tax (cut), we're giving the Democrats an issue,"" said Rep. Peter King, R-New York. ""There is no need to give it to them. They're the ones who mismanaged the economy. They are the ones who put us in this situation. We shouldn't allow them to get out from under that."" In his statement Monday, Obama cited the shifting position of Republicans on the issue and called for Congress to also extend unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the year. ""We cannot play games with unemployment insurance when we still have an unemployment rate that is way too high,"" Obama said, adding: ""This isn't just something that I want.  This isn't just a political fight. Independent economists, some of whom have in the past worked for Republicans, agree that if we don't extend the payroll tax cut and we don't extend unemployment insurance, it will hurt our economy.""","The proposed tax on the wealthy would be 1.9% for income over $1 million .

"(CNN) -- Next time there's a mass shooting, don't jump to blame the National Rifle Association and lax gun laws. Look first at the shooter and the mental health services he did or didn't get, and the commitment laws in the state where the shooting took place. Strengthening gun control won't stop the next mass shooter, but changing our attitudes, the treatment options we offer and the laws for holding the mentally unstable and mentally ill for treatment just might. Take the case of the recent mass shooting incident in Isla Vista, California. Police say Elliot Rodger went on a killing spree near the University of California campus in Santa Barbara, shooting and stabbing victims, killing six and wounding 13 before he killed himself. He had legally purchased three guns, passed a federal background check and met several other requirements in one of the most liberal states with the toughest gun control laws in the country. California was one of eight states that passed major gun reforms in the wake of 2012's Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in which a lone gunman killed 20 children and six adults. In fact California's gun control laws received an ""A-"" grade from both The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the Los Angeles Times reported. In this climate, how did Rodger succeed in his lethal plan? It wasn't the gun laws, it was the lack of common sense mental commitment laws. A 2014 report by the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit aimed at removing the stigma of mental illness and barriers to treatment, analyzed the state of mental commitment laws state by state, looking at both the ""quality of involuntary treatment (civil commitment) laws which facilitate emergency hospitalization during a psychiatric emergency and the availability of court orders mandating continued treatment as a condition of living in a community."" On virtually all counts, California received an ""F"" (it got a ""C"" on emergency evaluation). In Rodger's case, a friend concerned about alarming videos he'd posted on YouTube had alerted a county mental health staff member, and police had conferred with his mother, but this was not enough to get him committed. Under California's Welfare and Institutions Code Section 5150, a person must be a danger to himself or others before he can be held for 72 hours for evaluation, and the standard is even higher to mandate treatment. Police visiting Rodger found him to be ""polite and courteous"" and not an apparent danger, so they had no authority to detain him or search his home for weapons to seize. The reason had nothing to do with gun laws. It had to do with the commitment laws in California. We need to adopt a nationwide standard for involuntary civil commitment, and that standard should be ""need for treatment."" If a family member, law enforcement officer or mental health professional is concerned about the well-being of an individual, they should be able to have that individual held for a mental health evaluation. Indeed, the Treatment Advocacy Center's report describes the exact situation police found themselves in when they conducted that ""well-being"" check on Rodger: . ""But what if the person is neither threatening violence against anyone nor at any apparent imminent risk of injuring himself? What if the concern spurring the family member to seek help is simply that the person is suffering, tormented by terrifying delusions, yet somehow unaware that he is ill? Do we as a society have reason to intervene? To answer 'yes,' we must believe there is a compelling societal imperative beyond preventing imminent injury or death -- an imperative to liberate a person from a hellish existence he would never -- in his 'right mind' -- choose."" The truth is that commitment laws shouldn't be a stopgap to prevent imminent harm, but rather seen as an essential tool to help a loved one needing treatment before things reach the imminent harm stage. Next, we've got to connect the dots between mental health records and National Instant Background Check. In 2014, Mayors Against Illegal Guns released a report calling for states to close this gap. It found that 11 states and the District of Columbia have no reporting laws, and another 12 states have submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the national background check system. But connecting the dots won't help unless every gun sale is subject to an instant background check imposed on all licensed gun retailers. And finally, the police need tools as well. They need training and the discretion to ask about and remove guns from any household where there is a domestic dispute, a call for a ""well-being check,"" or a person who exhibits violent or unstable behavior. They also need a mental health professional on call for such checks. Connecticut, Indiana and, yes, even Texas have firearms seizure statutes aimed at dangerous persons. Laws like these enable the police to temporarily remove guns from someone who is exhibiting dangerous behavior until a judge can make a final determination on fitness for gun ownership based on evidence presented at a hearing. I know what you're thinking. ""This will only penalize gun owners. Most gun owners are law-abiding citizens."" You're right. And most gun owners believe in responsible ownership and agree that these mental health measures make sense . You may also be thinking: ""But most people suffering from serious mental illness are nonviolent."" You're right about that, too. Indeed, mentally ill people only account for a small fraction of the gun deaths in America every year and the vast majority of those are suicide, not homicide. Violence by the mentally ill is usually a symptom of the untreated mental illness -- that's why access to treatment, not gun control, is the answer. Overhauling mental health laws would give family members and professionals more responsibility and authority in care decisions. And in some cases, medications and therapies should not be optional. We've got a major problem on our hands. And since guns aren't going anywhere, the discussion about solutions needs to place the focus somewhere else. Even the NRA agrees that the seriously mentally ill should never own a gun. So let's finally do something about it.","Mel Robbins: When there's a mass shooting, don't blame NRA, blame mental health laws .

"At least 28 people died and 55 were wounded Saturday in clashes between protesters and members of a Libyan government-affiliated militia operating in the coastal city of Benghazi, the Libyan state news agency reported. The violence began when protesters attacked the headquarters of the Libyan Shield brigade, demanding the militia turn over responsibility for its security operations to the military, LANA reported. Benghazi's ruling Local Council and the Libyan Interior Ministry issued separate statements calling for ""self-restraint"" and an immediate end to the bloodshed. It's been nearly two years since the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and the new government has reinforced its military by contracting with a number of militia groups. Anger toward the militias, which are predominantly made up of former rebel fighters, has been building since Gadhafi's overthrow. It boiled over after some militias laid siege to government ministries in the capital city of Tripoli in April in an attempt to force the government to pass a law that would ban Gadhafi-era officials from holding office. Libya's government has acknowledged problems with trying to disarm arm and control a number of militias. The Libyan Shield brigade has previously said it is operating in Benghazi with the approval of the Ministry of Defense. Last year, protesters in Benghazi attacked a number of militia offices as part over the public anger that followed the attack on the U.S. Consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead.

"The long overdue verdict in the case of the former Liberian President Charles Taylor will be widely celebrated as a critical achievement for international criminal law. Taylor has been on trial at the special court for Sierra Leone since 2006 on 11 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, pillage and the conscription of child soldiers. Charles Taylor: Lay preacher and feared warlord . Champions of international justice will highlight the unquestionable importance of prosecuting a former head of state, which signals that political seniority is no guarantee of immunity. They will also see the child soldier charge against Taylor as particularly pertinent, given the recent focus on this crime in Africa by the Kony 2012 internet campaign and the International Criminal Court's (ICC) conviction of Congolese warlord Thomas Lubanga. Who is Taylor, exactly? But amid the celebrations at the end of the Taylor trial, important questions should be asked about the future of international justice. In the next few years, the war crimes tribunals for Sierra Leone, Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Lebanon and Cambodia will all close their doors, leaving the ICC as the sole international judicial institution. The Taylor trial asks two main questions that impinge on the ICC's ongoing work: does international justice genuinely help victims of mass crimes and are lengthy, expensive international trials a worthwhile investment by foreign donors in the age of austerity? For victims in Sierra Leone, Taylor's verdict brings relief . One answer to these questions is that it is of greater benefit to victims and better value for donors to invest in rebuilding domestic judicial institutions in conflict-affected countries rather than whisking atrocity suspects off to The Hague. See high-res photos of the Charles Taylor years . The Taylor trial highlights three main shortcomings of all international criminal justice institutions. First, the length of the Taylor trial is unjustifiable, delaying justice for his victims, dulling the societal impact of the case and increasing the financial costs. That it has taken the special court six years to deliver a verdict is partly due to the legal complexity of the case but also to the histrionics of international defense and prosecution lawyers, who have constantly sought media and donor attention. Key grandstanding moments during this trial included Taylor and his defense counsel twice walking out when judges demanded their participation and the prosecution's distraction of calling Naomi Campbell as a star witness. The case has also been delayed because several of the international legal personnel have other professional commitments alongside their work for the court. These included Taylor's defense counsel and one of the judges, who halfway through the trial took up a new role at the International Court of Justice. Second, the Taylor trial suffered -- as all international criminal cases do -- from the narrowness of the charges against him. Because of the inherent length and expense of international trials, prosecutors typically focus on crimes that they can most easily prove, rather than those that may be most representative of the suspect's atrocities or most salient in the eyes of affected populations. While the 11 charges against Taylor are more expansive than those brought against most international suspects, they still ignore arguably Taylor's most egregious crimes, namely those committed in his home country, Liberia, because of the special court's mandate which focuses solely on crimes committed within Sierra Leone. The trial also overlooks the role played by Taylor's various foreign backers, which during the conflict in Sierra Leone included Libya, Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire and a host of international corporations that profited from the blood diamonds used by Taylor-backed rebels to fund their military campaign. Without the training, logistical and financial support of these outside actors, Taylor could never have wrought such destruction on Sierra Leonean soil. Finally, the Taylor trial was weakened by the distance of the trial from the location -- and the victims -- of his crimes. In 2006 because of security concerns, the Freetown-based Special Court for Sierra Leone transferred Taylor to The Hague to be prosecuted in a courtroom leased from the ICC. This denied victims the opportunity to see firsthand the justice being done in their name. The distance also limited the number of Sierra Leoneans who could be called as defence and prosecution witnesses, which decreased the quality of evidence weighed by the Court. The problem of distance for international institutions is more than geographical and also one of a particular international legal mentality. Even international courts such as those for Sierra Leone and Cambodia, which are based in-country, are often wilfully detached from those societies, citing the need to remain neutral and impartial from domestic political influences. The transplant of foreign modes of law, with its wigs and gowns, and imposing, high-security courtrooms separate international law from local populations, even when those courtrooms are physically located in conflict-affected countries. Further highlighting this separation, when these international institutions pack up and leave in the coming years, they will have contributed little to the building of domestic legal infrastructure or training of local judicial personnel, who will have to carry on the task of delivering justice long after foreign lawyers have departed. These problems in the Taylor case highlight the inherent limitations of international criminal justice. Meanwhile, the recent example of high-level Rwandan genocide suspects being extradited home to face justice in a heavily reformed domestic system -- and in front of the Rwandan population -- highlights other important possibilities. In particular, it suggests that a new donor focus on supporting domestic judiciaries around the world might not only make financial sense but also deliver more tangible benefits to victims and societies recovering from mass conflict.","Taylor trial highlights three main shortcomings of international courts, says Phil Clark .
