"Carers at a nursing home who mocked vulnerable dementia patients and pelted them with beanbags did so for ‘gratuitous sport’ a judge said. Judge Michael Byrne said ‘weak and inadequate’ management at the  privately run home facilitated the ‘wholly unacceptable’ treatment of eight elderly Alzheimer’s sufferers. He jailed three members of staff for a total of 17 months. Last November, Katie Cairns (left), was convicted of . three charges including stamping on a man’s foot, throwing bean bags at . another male and mocking another. Carole Moore (right),  the care team leader from . Lancaster, was found guilty of one count in which she struck a resident . on the unit for residents with 'challenging behaviour'. Cairns was jailed today for five months; Moore was jailed for four months . The carers slapped and dragged the . screaming patients, who were all aged between 70 and 85 and unable to . speak or defend themselves, from their beds and threw beanbags at their . heads ‘for laughs’ because they were bored. One . man also had his foot stamped on and another was nearly tipped out of . his wheelchair during the assaults, which went on for more than a year. Preston Crown Court heard that, despite complaints, there was a . management ‘cover-up’ at Hillcroft Nursing Home, in Lancaster, and the . abuse was allowed to continue. It . was only after a whistleblower repeatedly contacted the Care Quality . Commission that social services were eventually contacted and police . launched an investigation. Gemma Pearson (left) was also convicted of attempting to tip another resident out of his wheelchair. She was given a 12-month community order with supervision and told to carry out 40 hours of unpaid work. Darren Smith, 35, from Lancaster, admitted ahead of the trial eight counts of ill-treatment in which he threw bean bags or ball at eight residents. He was jailed for eight months . All the offences at Hillcroft (above) spanned from May 2010 to September 2011 and related to seven men and one woman, all aged in their 70s or 80s, with the eldest aged 85 . Last . night Michael Rowlinson, the son of one of the victims, said the . decision to put his father, Norman, a retired chartered surveyor into . the home in the summer of 2010 was the ‘worst day of his life’. ‘The . decision to put my dad into care was one we didn’t take lightly,’ he . said. ‘As a family we were left with feelings of guilt. The defendants all worked the day . shift on the Coniston Unit at the home, which housed residents diagnosed . with dementia and displaying 'challenging behaviour', the court heard. Kathryn Johnson, prosecuting, told the court the four defendants ill-treated residents in 'varying ways'. 'They mocked them, bullied them and on occasions deliberately assaulted them,' she said. Miss . Johnson said bean bags should have been used as part of recreational . therapy but they were thrown so hard and fast that residents were unable . to catch them. 'This caused frustration and anger in the residents, whereas the defendants would laugh,' she said. Smith . and Moore would say 'they were doing it for their entertainment as they . were bored' and if residents objected, they 'would be subjected to it . all the more'. Evidence was heard that on one occasion Smith was discovered in bed with a resident and another male member of staff. Pearson was seen to tip a resident out of his wheelchair when he failed to stand up, causing him to stumble. The court heard that Pearson also took 'great delight' in going behind residents and blowing in their ears. ‘This . guilt only worsened when we found out my dad had been subjected to . abuse and humiliation. 'We don’t know how dad feels about it because of . his illness, but we know he would not have tolerated this type of . behaviour if he had seen it happen to others. ‘We feel angry that this could have been allowed to happen. ‘The experience has broken down our trust. We will always wish that we could have been able to look after dad at home.’ Chris . Haywood, 37, whose father, Ken, a former RAF serviceman, had his foot . stamped on during the attacks, said the carers had been laughing behind . their backs. ‘Your worst . nightmare in these scenarios is basically what’s happened,’ Mr Haywood, a . customer services’ adviser, said. ‘These are people I shared a cup of . tea with while discussing my dad’s care. ‘Were they laughing at us behind our backs and waiting for us to leave so they could do it again?’ Team . leader Carol Ann Moore, 54, and nurses Katie Cairns, 27, and Gemma . Pearson, 28, all denied ill-treatment and neglect, but were found guilty . following a four-week trial. Moore, who was convicted of slapping a . male patient ‘in revenge’ after his wife complained about a lack of . activities at the home, was jailed for four months. Cairns, . who stamped on Mr  Haywood’s foot, threw beanbags at residents and . taunted an elderly man by pulling loose skin on his neck, was jailed for . five months. Pearson, who . tried to tip a patient out of his wheelchair when he refused to stand . up, was given a 12-month community order and ordered to carry out 40 . hours of unpaid work. A fourth carer,  Darren Smith, 35,  who threw . beanbags at residents, admitted ill-treatment ahead of the trial and was . jailed for eight months. Management at the home ruled there was insufficient evidence for a wider investigation and failed to pass on the complaints to social services . Judge . Byrne told the carers: ‘The offences you committed were carried out as a . gratuitous sport at the expense of vulnerable victims. ‘Victims . of dementia are extremely vulnerable and susceptible to others. Their . quality of daily life is dependent on the help of others. ‘Each . of these defendants deliberately broke the trust placed in them. Any . deliberate act of ill treatment is wholly unacceptable.’ All the offences occurred between May 2010 and September 2011. 'Worst day of our lives': Families' anger at relatives' treatment . Relatives of the ill-treated elderly dementia sufferers have spoken of their heartbreak and anger. One son of a victim chose to enter the witness box to give his statement in person. Michael Rawlinson said his family’s decision to place his father, Norman, a retired chartered surveyor, into care was the 'worst day of our lives'. He said that decision was not taken lightly because his father, married for 57 years, had Alzheimer’s and was unable to give his opinion. He said: 'We had feelings of guilt for not being able to look after him. 'Our feelings of guilt only worsened when we found out that Dad had been subjected to humiliation and ill-treatment by those who were trusted to care for him. 'We feel angry this could have been allowed to happen to Dad and sorry that Mum had to learn about it.” He said evidence heard at the trial had 'saddened us greatly'. Mr Rawlinson said a clear signal had to be sent by the courts that such behaviour could not be tolerated. He asked: 'What sort of human being treats another with such disrepect?' He added that he thought it was clear that management at Hillcroft had covered up the incidents and that they and the owners had failed to ensure the safety of the residents. Mr Rawlinson said he did not believe the Care and Quality Commission (CQC) had held Hillcroft to account. He said he was still awaiting formal apologies from the defendants and Hillcroft’s management and directors. The prosecutor read out statements from other relatives. A daughter of one victim said she was 'devastated' when she was informed of the abuse. 'She has felt a huge amount of guilt because she had moved her father to the home because she thought it was the better place to be in,' she said. Another relative described how she was informed of the abuse against her mother. 'To receive a letter and to be informed that your parent has possibly been physically abused in a place that is thought to be comfortable for them is heartbreaking,' she said. She said she wanted to know why the defendants had acted like they did and what they would think if their parents were treated in the same manner. The son of the man whose foot was stamped on also thanked whistleblowers in the case who were 'brave enough' to come forward. The wife of another victim described feeling that members of staff had been 'laughing at the families behind their backs' and that the carers had abused her trust. Judge Byrne said three common themes emerged from the statements given by families. He said: 'In each and every case, the victim’s family trusted the home to look after their relative. 'Secondly, many of the families felt a sense of guilt of having to give up the care of one of their family to be cared for by strangers. 'And thirdly, the anger and resentment at the trust being betrayed.'","Residents at Hillcroft nursing home in Slyne-with-Hest, Lancs were bullied as they would have no memory of abuse .

"Birdwatchers everywhere are in a bit of a flap. A photograph of a bird with a visible egg inside its body has been taken for what is believed to be the first time ever. A team of experts had visited a remote Indian Ocean tropical island to study the critically endangered Mascarene Petrel. A photograph of a bird with a visible egg inside its body has been taken for what is believed to be the first time ever. The critically endangered Mascarene Petrel was being studied by scientists at Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean when the amazing picture was taken . Unlike land birds, some sea-birds have feathers which hug their body more to stop them getting wet - thus making the bump better defined (left). Pictured right, a file photo of the rare Mascarene Petrel . Little is known about the elusive sea-bird - but what the researchers came back with is an image of a clearly gravid (ie egg-carrying) member of the species in flight. The picture showing the obvious egg bump has given researchers fresh insight into the timing of the petrel's breeding season on Reunion Island, the bird's only known habitat. The discovery was described in the latest Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club. 'Against the background of a pinkish-orange sunset, with Reunion Island in the distance, I spotted a petrel through my camera's viewfinder. 'Almost immediately I saw the outline of an egg, a huge bump at its belly. I called out to the other expedition members - ""She has an egg, she has an egg...""', said author Hadoram Shirihai. 'She flew close to the boat which gave me the unique chance to photograph her just before the sun set. 'It was a magical moment, and to think that in less than an hour she would probably lay her egg and contribute to the future survival of this threatened species.' The picture showing the obvious egg bump has given researchers fresh insight into the timing of the petrel's breeding season on Reunion Island (above), the bird's only known habitat . In total, the researchers studied 33 Mascarene Petrels and photographed 12 of them. But it was only due to a series of coincidences that the image came to light. Unlike land birds, some sea-birds have feathers which hug their body more to stop them getting wet - thus making the bump better defined. Furthermore, the petrel was in flight - making it even easier to spot. And finally, it also helped that the petrel's eggs are 'disproportionately huge'. Most extraordinary of all is the fact the picture was of an extremely rare bird - something which has astonished BirdLife International, the conservation group that released the picture and compiles the official Red List of endangered birds.","Scientist photographed Mascarene Petrel off Reunion Island in Indian Ocean while it was in flight .

"Manchester City, who thought they would escape the Allianz Arena with a hard fought draw, succumbed to a late Bayern Munich winner, scored by Jerome Boateng. Here, Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein gives his verdict on the performances of both sets of players. BAYERN (4-3-3) MANUEL NEUER  - Made everything look ridiculously easy including a near-post save from Edin Dzeko. 7 . Thomas Muller had an opportunity to score in the first couple of minutes but put his shot inches wide . RAFINHA - Plenty of energy as a right wing-back but not always the highest quality. 6.5 . JEROME BOATENG -Excellent reading of the game. His wasted season at City is a mystery and after being foiled by Hart, he broke their hearts with a late, late strike. 7.5 . MEHDI BENATIA - Didn't take any prisoners, appearing to knee Silva in the back at one stage. 6.5 . JUAN BERNAT - Dangerous on the left-hand side, with fantastic delivery from wide areas. 7.5 . Fernandinho played well for Manchester City and set the tone in the centre of the park . PHILIPP LAHM - The man is a machine. Nothing spectacular but always a leader. 6.5 . XABIO ALONSO- Seems to have got over his World Cup loss of form. Neat and tidy. 6.5 . DAVID ALABA - His pace and movement caused City problems. Always a threat. 7 . THOMAS MULLER - Excellent movement but left his prolific World Cup scoring form at home. 6.5 . ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI - Looks ungainly but he gave the Bayern attack a focal point. 6.5 . Mehdi Benatia, who was making his Champions League debut against City, challenges Samir Nasri . MARIO GOTZE - Denied by Joe Hart when set to add to his famous goals collection. 7 . SUBS . Robben 76 (for Muller) 5.5 - The best and worst, great dribble followed by Olympic dive as Fernandinho came across to challenge . Claudio Pizarro 84 (for Rafinha), . Dante (for Benatia 85) PEP GUARDIOLA - Got it right tactically, though the win was late in coming. 7.5 . Robert Lewandowski has endured a slower than expected start at Bayern Munich since his summer move . Man City (4-5-1) JOE HART -Back to his best with a string of saves particularly from Muller, Gotze, Bernat and Boateng. He didn't deserve to end up on the losing side. 9 . BACARY SAGNA - Given the nod at right-back and survived early penalty shout on Muller. 6.5 . VINCENT KOMPANY- The sort of dogfight he loved. A great battle with Lewandowski. 7 . MARTIN DEMICHELIS - No reason for Pellegrini to use £32m Mangala with Demichelis steady. 6.5 . GAEL CLICHY - Over-worked and no surprise when he was booked for foul on Rafinha. 6 . Jesus Navas enjoyed a rare start as Manuel pellegrini opted to begin the match with a five-man midfield . SAMIR NASRI - Speed of game seemed to pass him by. Replaced by James Milner. 5.5 . FERNANDINHO - Couldn't stem Bayern fully and relieved his handball was judged accidental. 6 . YAYA TOURE- Rested at weekend to recover from Ivory Coast duty. Hasn't recovered. 5.5 . JESUS NAVAS - His blistering pace was a good outlet. One sprint and cross set up Silva. 6 . Bacary Sagna played well in his first Champions League match for Manuel Pellegrini's side . DAVID SILVA- What a player. Set up Dzeko with a pass of beauty & nearly headed a winner. 7.5 . EDIN DZEKO - Tried manfully in lone striker's role and took the hits, but blew his goal chance. 6 . SUBS . Milner 58 (for Nasri) 6 - The discipline you'd expect from Milner in a central midfield role . Aguero 74 (for Dzeko) 5.5 - City on the backfoot by the time he came on . Kolarov 87 (for Navas) MANUEL PELLEGRINI - Outplayed but can claim his tough love to Joe Hart has worked. 6.5 . REFEREE . UNDIANO MALLENCO - Did well to control a full-blooded match. 6.5 . In-form Bosnian forward Edin Dzeko was preferred up front to Sergio Aguero for Manchester City .","Manchester City lost 1-0 with Bayern Munich in Champions League .

"Beauden Barrett inspired New Zealand to a thumping 28-9 win over Argentina in the Rugby Championship at McLean Park, Napier. Despite the wet conditions, the Hurricanes stand-off showed his flair with ball in hand and played key roles in tries for Julian Savea (two) and Liam Messam. It was an impressive performance from the 23-year-old, who was making his first Test start at fly-half, with the only small blot on his copybook perhaps his inaccuracy with the boot as he failed to convert all three of those tries. Score: Aaron Smith crosses the line to secure New Zealand's bonus point . Emphatic: Smith dived over in dramatic fashion late in the second half . Getting stuck in: All Blacks' captain Richie McCaw in the thick of the action . On the run: Beauden Barrett is pursued by Argentina's Nicolas Sanchez . Slippery: New Zealand and Argentina players had to contend with torrential rain in Napier . His opposite number Nicolas Sanchez, who struggled to deal with Barrett's intelligent breaks all game, kicked all of Argentina's points. The Pumas will feel aggrieved after they had a perfectly good try ruled out near the end, but the All Blacks will be satisfied after scrum-half Aaron Smith added a fourth touchdown late on to add gloss to the scoreline. Barrett cut the Pumas open early on with a chip over the top to Savea in the corner, but the towering flyer was prevented from catching for a certain try after a cynical early tackle from Horacio Agulla, who was lucky to escape without punishment. It took the visitors five minutes to get out of their own half, with Barrett missing a penalty in the driving rain, but Argentina coach Daniel Hourcade would have been delighted with their response. Two strong drives from Juan Manuel Leguizamon, with the latter seeing him stopped just short of the line, caught the eye as the visitors went through the phases to have a sustained period in All Black territory. Dejected: Argentina's Juan Martin Hernandez and Joaquin Tuculet trudge off after losing to New Zealand . Celebration: L-r Kieran Read and Israel Dagg relish Smith's try . Up in the air: Barrett and Marcelo Bosch compete for a high ball . Committed: Martin Landajo (9) has a kick charged down by the tenacious Brodie Retallick . In vain: Juan Manuel Laguizamon makes a break against the All Blacks . Tackle: McCaw brings down Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe . Eyes on the ball: Retallick charges down another Landajo kick . But New Zealand's defence is a tough nut to crack and the hosts held out before forcing a penalty at the breakdown further up field. This time Barrett made no mistake and settled his nerves by making it 3-0. Sanchez deservedly levelled the score with a kick of his own, before the All Blacks struck after 27 minutes. Barrett's grubber sent Brodie Retallick through just past halfway, with the lock showing superb commitment and skills to take the loose ball cleanly, before the hosts shifted it wide and Conrad Smith's chip bounced favourably for Savea to touch down. The All Black fly-half's failure to add the conversion looked costly when Sanchez made it 8-6, but Barrett atoned with a sweeping line break on the inside of his opposite number before putting Messam over to make it 13-6 on the stroke of half-time. He was the orchestrator again as the All Blacks shifted through the gears in the second half, foxing Sanchez with a shimmy before sending the on-rushing Savea, racing outside off his wing, over the line for his 26th try in 25 Tests in the 44th minute. Barrett failed to add the extras again, with Sanchez clawing it back to 18-9 with a kick of his own, before he was replaced by Colin Slade. Off target: Nicolas Sanchez attempts a drop goal during Argentina's 28-9 defeat against New Zealand . Tenacious: McCaw is tackled by the Pumas Marcos Ayerza . Top of the table: Ma'a Nonu challenges Rodrigo Baez as New Zealand climbed to the top of the Rugby Championship standings . Referee Pascal Gauzere stunned the crowd in Napier when he inexplicably ruled out a try for Argentina. Leonardo Senatore charged down a clearance from Ma'a Nonu and followed it through to touch down, but the official judged the charge down to be a knock-on - although Kiwi fans might argue it was justice after Savea was illegally blocked early doors. While the Pumas were still licking their wounds, Slade made it 21-9 to Steve Hansen's side before Kieran Read broke off the base of a scrum to send Aaron Smith strolling over - with Slade adding the extras - in the closing moments, .","Two Julian Savea tries and one each from Liam Messam and Aaron Smith lift New Zealand to the top of the Rugby Championship table .

"The boss of an alpaca transport company and two other men have today been jailed for 30 years for conspiring to murder his wife. Bruce Killick, 63, from Brooks Green, near Horsham, West Sussex, was found guilty of the planned attack against his wife, Susan, after a five-week trial at Hove Crown Court. Killick was convicted of hiring labourer Karl Cruise, 55, through alpaca farmer Graham Martin, 39, who are both British nationals living in Plouray in the Brittany region of France. Cruise attacked Mrs Killick at her home in February with a hammer, plant pot and screwdriver, and tried to use a stun gun on her. He also repeatedly smashed her head on the floor. Bruce Killick (left) was today convicted of hiring labourer Karl Cruise (right), 55, through alpaca farmer Graham Martin, 39, to kill Killick's wife, Susan. Cruise attacked Mrs Killick at her home with a hammer, plant pot and screwdriver . The court heard that Killick claimed his payment of £10,000 to the pair was for an alpaca as a 30th wedding anniversary present to his wife, then aged 61. Sentencing them, Judge Michael Lawson said: 'This was a horrific offence born out of greed and lust. The victim thought this was a marriage of joy and this has been violated and destroyed for financial gain.' Killick was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment, to serve a minimum of 20 years; Martin was jailed for 30 years, to serve a minimum of 20; and Cruise for 30, to serve a minimum of 15, as well as 11 years to run concurrently for GBH with intent. Describing the planned attack, which Mrs Killick survived, a Sussex Police spokesman said: 'On the afternoon of February 18, Susan had been home alone in Emms Lane when she had answered the door to Cruise, who claimed his car had broken down. 'He asked to use her phone to contact a garage but followed her into her kitchen where he then began his attack. The court heard that Killick claimed his payment of £10,000 to Cruise and Martin was for an alpaca as a 30th wedding anniversary present to his wife, then aged 61. File photo . 'He first hit her with a hammer and then punched her, knocking her to the ground and smashed her head repeatedly on the floor. 'He then attacked her with a plant pot, screwdriver and tried to use a stun gun on her. 'The then 61-year-old victim still managed to fight him off and stopped him from hitting her over the head with a heavy step-stool. 'Cruise then dragged her across the kitchen before trying to stab her, first with a blunt bread knife and then with a paring knife. 'It was only when Cruise became very short of breath, having suffered a medical episode, that she was able to get away from him, alerting her next-door neighbours. 'Her quick-thinking neighbour was able to take down part of Cruise's French number plate and he was arrested in Portsmouth that evening. Cruise pleaded guilty to GBH with intent. 'Killick had made arrangements to ensure he was not at the address when the attack occurred and to provide him with a legitimate alibi. ' The jury heard how he had sent texts to Martin asking how much to get rid of someone but always maintained the £10,000 transferred to Martin just days before the attack was for an alpaca for his and Susan's 30th wedding anniversary. Detective Inspector David Springett said: 'This was a planned and incredibly brutal attack against Mrs Killick, orchestrated by her husband and carried out by his criminal associates. 'I am sure that if it was not for her sustained self-defence then Mrs Killick would not have survived this assault. 'Thankfully she has largely recovered physically but I have no doubt her emotional trauma will be long felt. 'This offence has been motivated by greed and Mr Killick's desire to start a new life with his mistress. 'The fact he has been married to Mrs Killick for over 30 years and sought to explain the payment of funds for the murder as an anniversary present for her are chilling. 'I am delighted the jury has found all three guilty of the part they played in trying to plan this murder. 'I hope Mrs Killick is able to continue to recover and carry on with her life and put this ordeal behind her knowing her attackers have been brought to justice.'","Bruce Killick, 63, of West Sussex, was found guilty of planned attack against wife Susan .

"Ever wondered about some of the three letter airport codes across the world? While some are clearly obvious, others just leave us scratching our heads. But airport codes are more than just three randomly assigned letters stuck to your luggage. These little abbreviations are telling us exactly where we are flying around the world. While some make perfect sense for example Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, they're all pretty simple - SYD, MEL, PER, the first three letters of each city's name. Scroll down for video . Departure Lounge at Sydney airport (pictured) Sydney has a simple code of SYD, not like some of its other airports . Passengers in Melbourne airport (pictured). This airport code is pretty easy just MEL . The Domestic Terminal Perth Airport Australia (pictured). The ones that make perfect sense, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, they're all pretty simple - SYD, MEL, PER, the first three letters of each city's name. And you'd think it would be just as simple for every other airport to follow, but not so. Brisbane had to ditch the BRI in favour of BNE because it was already taken by an airport in the Italian city of Bari, according to the Australian Business Traveller. Unfortunately the easy selection of BAR had to be avoided because it was assigned to the Baker Army Airfield which is now abandoned. And in some cases the tricky airport code skips a letter or two just like Adelaide's ADL and Auckland's AKL or in Hong Kong's case (HKG) picking a few from both words. Adelaide airport (pictured) has a fairly simple airport code ADL, skipping just one letter . BNE Brisbane International Airport (pictured) Brisbane had to ditch the BRI in favour of BNE because it was already taken by an airport in the Italian city of Bari . But here comes the more cryptic codes, that leave us asking the question, why? Almost every traveller usually understands the LAX code which stands for the famous Los Angeles airport - but have you ever wondered where that X comes from? According to Australian Business Traveller it's a remnant from the early days of air travel when airports were referred to by a two letter 'weather station' code. When the growth of air travel created the need for three-letter codes, the airport’s original designation had an ‘X’ amended to ease the transition, as did Portland (PDX). Dublin, Ireland took the code DUB so that meant that Dubai had to import the 'X' to make it DXB, only really to fill out the three characters. In other cases across the world, the airport codes take the first letter of the city's name followed by two letters for the airport itself. London, Heathrow is LHR while one of the countries other main airports London Gatwick is LGW. Or to really throw a spanner in the works, and getting rid of the L altogether, the London Stansted airport is tagged as STN, slightly confusing. London Heathrow Airport (pictured) LHR. In London the airport codes take the first letter of the city's name followed by two letters for the airport itself . Beijing airport in China (pictured) Beijing is PEK. It represents the old anglicised name of Peking which was changed to Beijing after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 . In Asia, old school sometimes takes preference. Beijing is in fact PEK. It represents the old anglicised name of Peking which was changed to Beijing after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. In the United States, Chicago is also stepping back in time with its code ORD. While officially known as the O'Hare International Airport, the original O'Hare field strip was adjacent to a small farming community called Orchard Place, which was taken by the airport. And you'd be excused for thinking WTF when you arrive in Canada with all of the nation's airport codes beginning with the letter Y. In the early days of broadcast radio the North American market was divided into three geographic zones, each carrying a regional-specific letter to be used in front of a station's callsign. Australian Business Traveller says the US stations were assigned W if they were located east of the Mississippi River and K if they were west of the mighty Mississippi. All radio stations in Canada got Y. So you've got Vancouver (YVR) and Ottawa (YOW). Toronto airport in Canada (pictured) Oh Canada! Toronto's appellation of YYZ is more of a puzzler, and came about because YTO was already assigned as Toronto’s generic region code . And even when we go closer to home, the airport codes get a little crazy for thought. The proposed Sydney West Airport at Badgery's Creek has already been christened as SWZ. And there's even the slightly funny ones, that might send out a chuckle. Has anyone flown to SUX? The airport code for Sioux City, Iowa. Apparently the airport has made fun of its unfortunate name selling a variety of SUX souvenirs. But the more unfortunate ones are these. Russia's Bolshoye Savino Airport is stuck with PEE, while the number 2 version goes to Brazil's Poco De Caldas Airport with POO. There's even one for FAT, the airport code for Fresno, Calif.","Airport codes are more than just three random letters .

"CLICK HERE TO READ MARTIN SAMUEL'S MATCH REPORT FROM OLD TRAFFORD . With several new signings on show for Manchester United against QPR on Sunday, a sense of excitement was back at Old Trafford. Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo started the Premier League game in front of their home fans for the first time, but it was Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera who really impressed. Di Maria stole the show with his direct running and trickery, while Herrera's goal summed up his box-to-box performance. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Angel Di Maria scored Manchester United's first at Old Trafford in the 4-0 win against QPR on Sunday . Sandro and the rest of the visiting midfield couldn't handle Manchester United's new superb No 7 . United lined up with a diamond formation, and four at the back for the first time this season. That meant Argentina's World Cup left back Rojo could line up in that position for his new side, while Blind was used in the role Ajax preferred him in, the base of the midfield. Di Maria and Herrera were given the 'running roles' in midfield, providing width for the first part, but also covering centrally when needed. The former in particular, excelled in this role. The 26-year-old winger was experimented in the role last season by Argentina and Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti praising his dynamism and work rate in certain fixtures, particularly against Barcelona. That speed and energy was on show again versus QPR, with the majority of United's attacks coming down the left. Di Maria was often laying the ball off before sprinting for a quick one-two, while his lung-busting runs on and off the ball were difficult for Mauricio Isla to handle. Excitement levels soared every time Angel Di Maria touched the ball... his pace was frightening . ANGEL DI MARIA WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW ON SUNDAY... CLICK HERE TO VIEW MORE STATS WITH OUR WONDERFUL MATCH ZONE SERVICE . Marcos Rojo excelled down the left hand side and formed a partnership with Argentina team mate Di Maria . Marcos Rojo was unlucky not to be credited with an assist after a fine run resulted in a well placed cross . He also worked well down that side with Rojo, as they did for Argentina in the World Cup, and the former Sporting Lisbon man was unlucky not to be credited with an assist after his fine run forward was matched by a neat cross to find Herrera. Robin van Persie poked the ball away from the Spaniard at the final second. The Cristiano Ronaldo, Ryan Giggs effect was clear every time Di Maria had it; the crowd were on the edge of their seats in the knowledge something would happen when the ball was at his feet. With Wayne Rooney and Van Persie asked to spread to provide more width at times, that also gave Di Maria space to run at Sandro centrally when he wanted. His inadvertent goal from a sublime crossed free-kick was certainly deserved, and as his confidence grew in the second half the tricks came out. The supporters were in awe as a couple of back heels from Di Maria in his own half left the QPR players dumbfounded. United fans have got used to their No 7's producing the spectacular, and they have surely found another one to do just that. Pinpoint accuracy with his crosses, outside of the foot finesse and the quick feet to humiliate anybody. Di Maria is the Real deal from Madrid. Daley Blind started at the base of the diamond and impressed technically, but he will need to improve physically . Michael Carrick's injury gave Blind the chance to impress in his favoured role, 'No 6'. The 24-year-old has been used as utiliy player throughout his career, and has operated at left-back, centre midfield, and even centre back for his national team. Patrick Kluivert described him in the build-up as an 'extremely intelligent player' tactically, and his technical ability was clear to see, especially given the midfield options United have had in the past. Blind started moves from the back, read the game well and has a wand of a left foot. One attribute he may want to build on is of a physical nature, with Leroy Fer dominating him at times. Opposing teams may look to target this in the future. Ander Herrera netted his first goal for Manchester United from the edge of the box against QPR . Ander Herrera started at the right of a midfield diamond but popped up in a number of positions . Herrera was another man who was brought in (albeit by David Moyes initially) with the view to being able to fulfill several tactical duties. His favourite position would probably be the tip of this diamond, but he performed well on the right hand side. He was possibly United's most dangerous player in and around the box, often arriving late and could have had more than his one goal in the first half alone. He was occasionally caught in possession when looking for a spectacular long range pass, but as with Di Maria, his energy and ability would have been extremely pleasing for Van Gaal. Radamel Falcao came on late on for Juan Mata as he joined up with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie up top . Radamel Falcao was the man all United fans were dying to see make his debut, but they were made to wait for the Colombian striker. Interestingly, he came on for Juan Mata off the bench, meaning Van Persie, Rooney and Falcao were all on the pitch at the same time. Rooney and Van Persie switched between dropping deep and supporting the 28-year-old, and it could be a system Van Gaal opts for in the future. The Dutch boss used over 30 players in five competitive games, but he may well have found a team and system that sticks. Especially if Di Maria continues this form.","Angel Di Maria the star of the show as Manchester United beat QPR 4-0 .

"Prosecutors allege a man living in a Massachusetts hotel put hot sauce in the mouth of his girlfriend's three-year-old son and then taped it shut. Christopher Delcid, 21, was held on $250,000 bail after pleading not guilty Wednesday to assault and battery on a child and child abandonment. The boy was found alone in the Danvers hotel room Tuesday. The child told police that bruises on his body were caused by his 'daddy' who hit him with a shoe and a belt as punishment. Alleged abuse: Christopher Delcid, 21, denied causing injuries to the three-year-old child of his girlfriend, saying the boy made up abuse allegations . Delcid is not the child's biological father, but is the father of his two younger siblings with the boy's mother, Katherine Rodriguez. She has also been arraigned on child abuse charges. Police responded to the Extended Stay America hotel in Danvers after the hotel's front desk received a call from Delcid's sister concerned about the child. Officers knocked repeatedly before asking a manager to let them in. There they found the toddler lying on a mattress in the corner of the room, alone. He told officers he'd been left there while Rodriguez, Delcid and his two siblings had gone out with friends because he had been 'bad,' reports the Salem News. Mother of three: Katherine Rodriguez has two young children by her boyfriend Christopher Delcid, and a three-year-old boy by a former partner who is now incarcerated . He had multiple injuries, and was able to explain how he sustained each one. A scratch on his face, he told police, he did to himself. He was trying to remove tape from his lips, placed there by his 'daddy' after he'd filled the child's mouth with hot sauce. A bruise on his calf was caused by Delcid hitting him with a shoe. Other injuries included bruising to his side and buttocks caused by Delcid hitting him with a belt, a black eye from being punched, and marks around his wrists where they were bound with tape, the boy told police. The Salem News reports that the little boy told police that he was punished 'Every day. Daddy says I’m bad every day.' Living arrangements: The family was living in an Extended Stay America hotel room, where the little boy was found alone after Delcid and Rodriguez went out with their two younger children . Delcid's lawyer said his client has alternate explanations for the toddler's injuries. The boy has ADD and that he has made false accusations against carers in the past, a lawyer for Delcid said. The lawyer claimed that the boy sustained the injuries falling off playground equipment and slamming his own head into things. Almost two hours after police found the boy, Rodriguez had still not returned to the hotel for her son. She has been held on $100,000 bail after being arraigned on child abuse charges. All three of her children have been taken into custody by the Department of Children and Families.","Police found a three-year-old boy alone in a hotel room in Massachusetts .

"Martin Samuel's attack on the Champions League seeding system . The seeding system for the group stages of the Champions League is set to be changed by UEFA. The top eight seeds in the competition would be the holders, plus the champions of the top-seven ranked UEFA nations. Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel attacked the current seeding system, highlighting the absurdity of Arsenal, who finished fourth in the Premier League last season, being in Pot 1 while title winners Manchester City are in Pot 2. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini talk about the seeding for Champions League . Seeds of doubt: Fernando Hierro draws Manchester City's name from Pot 2 . Skewed: Arsenal, shown by Iker Casillas, were among the Champions League top seeds . Were the new rules in play this season, here's how Pot 1 would have looked: . 1 Spain - Atletico . 2 England - Manchester City . 3 Germany - Bayern Munich . 4 Portugal -Benfica . 5 Italy - Juventus . 6 Russia - CSKA Moscow . 7 France - PSG . 8 Holders - Real Madrid . But Sky Sports News has revealed that talks  took place earlier this year and the plans over seeding - which are the same as Samuel outlined in Sportsmail on Friday - were approved by the club competition committee in May. UEFA president Michel Platini hopes the rules would stop domestic champions in the major European leagues being ranked lower than other clubs from their nations. It would also prevent situations like in this season's Group A where the champions of Italy (Juventus), Spain (Atletico Madrid), Holland (Ajax) and Sweden (Malmo) are all in together. The plan needs approval from the UEFA executive committee - whose next meeting is on September 18 - before it can be introduced but it is hoped it would take effect from next season. The system currently works on the co-efficient system, where clubs' previous Champions League performances and the ranking of their domestic league is taken into account.","UEFA set to change the Champions League seeding system .

"With the transfer window firmly closed until January, Premier League clubs up and down the land have a few months to reflect on their summer business. But which sides had a window to remember? Who surprised their rivals with some wise acquisitions? And which players who chose to go elsewhere would've been the biggest asset to England's top-flight? We asked our three wise men - Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp - those questions and more. Here's what they had to say. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Costa and Welbeck in action this week for their countries . Big money buy: Manchester United splashed a British record transfer fee on midfielder Angel di Maria . Which team 'won' the transfer window? JAMIE CARRAGHER: Chelsea, without a doubt. They got most of their business done early and always seemed to be in control. The way Diego Costa has started is so impressive and we've still not seen Filipe Luis, who is a top player. And the money they've spent is not too bad when you compare it to United. Perfect start: Diego Costa has bagged four goals already after joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid . JAMIE REDKNAPP: Chelsea did their business early and got £50million for David Luiz. Further down the table, Aston Villa did well to keep Ron Vlaar. And I really want Tom Cleverley to do well. He's been a scapegoat for too long. New and old: Cesc Fabregas (left) is pulling the strings in Chelsea's midfield while Didier Drogba (right) has returned to the club to provide  experience . MARTIN KEOWN: It's a full house. Chelsea won it the day they sold David Luiz for £50m. And then they got £28m for Romelu Lukaku. Unbelievable business. Financial fair play rules have made them become better negotiators. Reasons to smile: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) finds his side on top of the Premier League table . Is Danny Welbeck good business for Arsenal? KEOWN: It is good business. United are becoming a team of galacticos and he doesn’t fit into that. I’m not sure United have ever been convinced about him. It will be exciting for him to work with Arsene Wenger. He improves young players and has a superb record with top strikers: Klinsmann, Weah, Bergkamp, Henry. Welbeck is not clinical in front of goal but he’ll practise that. I remember Emmanuel Adebayor rarely hitting the target when he first joined Arsenal but Wenger had him practising and the improvement was phenomental. He’s the same price as Mario Balotelli but Welbeck will be here for the long term, Balotelli won’t. My only worry is that he could be in mourning about leaving such a great club. He needs to realise he has joined another and can finally take centre stage. Fresh start: Danny Welbeck left Manchester United to join Arsenal in a £16million deal on transfer deadline day . CARRAGHER: I can see the positives of his move from both sides. His goalscoring record isn’t great so I can see why United have moved him on. A lot of people at United will be loath to see a local lad go. And he has real pace, which United don’t have much of. He’s a good fit for Arsenal but he’ll play a similar role: sometimes he’ll be out wide, sometimes through the middle and sometimes on the bench. Is he really going to be their No 1 striker? REDKNAPP: I like him and always hear good things about his attitude and personality. He’s a good athlete but doesn’t score enough goals and doesn’t get in the right positions enough. I’m pleased for Arsenal fans that they signed someone. Welbeck is going there with a real point to prove. Point to prove: Welbeck, pictured in England training, will be hoping for regular playing time at the Emirates . Outside the heavyweights, who got the best deal? REDKNAPP: Hull signed match- winners in Gaston Ramirez and Hatem Ben Arfa. And I won’t apologise for saying it but Sandro is an excellent signing — he’s a monster, exactly what QPR needed. He’s got a tremendous attitude and work ethic and is an infectious character who will rub off on everyone. Talented: The signing of French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa on loan from Newcastle was a coup for Hull City . KEOWN: Hull landing Ben Arfa. He was never a bad player, he just fell out with Alan Pardew. He has so much ability. CARRAGHER: I agree on Sandro. He’s a big strong player, who impressed me for Tottenham. He has a physical presence and QPR needed Premier League experience. They just have to keep him fit. One signing you wish had happened... CARRAGHER: I’d have loved to have seen Xabi Alonso come back to the Premier League instead of moving to Bayern Munich. He’s such a good passer of the ball. KEOWN: Toni Kroos. I don’t know why Van Gaal didn’t want him. Instead he went to Real Madrid. He passes the ball so cleanly. REDKNAPP: I agree with Jamie on Alonso and would have also liked to have seen Arsenal sign Falcao. They are so close to being title contenders. Moving on: Xabi Alonso (left) left Real Madrid for Bayern Munich, while Toni Kroos (right) went the other way .

"A top general warned on Monday that planned reductions in the size of military could have a harmful effect on the United States' ability to fight the Islamic State and counter Russia's aggression in Eastern Europe. The military has already cut its active duty forces from a peak of 570,000 down to 510,000 troops. Budget reductions approved in 2011 call for troop numbers to fall to 490,000. Automatic spending cuts associated with sequestration could bring that number down to as few as 420,000 troops. Chief of Staff to the Army Gen. Raymond Odierno said at a news conference on Monday that he was uncomfortable about a potential reduction in forces because of the threats to the U.S. and it's hegemony from around the globe. 'The world is changing in front of us. We have seen Russian aggression in Europe, we have seen ISIS, we have seen increased stability in other places,' Gen. Odierno said, according to the Wall Street Journal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Raymond Odierno is pictured here testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 6. Odierno said Monday that proposed cuts to the military's budget and size would undercut the United States' ability to defeat ISIS and counter Russia in Eastern Europe . 'So I now have concern whether even going below 490,000 is the right thing to do or not, because of what I see potentially on the horizon.' Odierno was speaking at an Association of the U.S. Army event when he levied the complaint. It's not the first time the retiring general has spoken up in the last few weeks about his concerns that cuts to the military are becoming too drastic, and he's not the only military expert who is apprehensive about the curtailment. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who is also a former secretary of defense, has vocally opposed the shrinkage. 'I think we're entering a period of considerable danger with the United States that relative to other nations is weaker than we oughta be,' he told The Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol over the weekend. Speaking broadly about the Middle East, Cheney said it would be 'crazy' to 'look at that part of the world and think we can hide behind our ocean.' 'You gotta be a fool to believe isolationist strategy is the way to go,' he said. 'We have no choice to be involved in that part of the world, and if we're not actively involved, some very bad things are gonna happen,' he forewarned. He later argued that 'this is not the time for us to rest on our laurels' and cut the defense budget. Iraqi soldiers inspect the site of a car bomb attack in Habibiyah district, northeast of Baghdad on Monday. Local media reports said at least 30 people were killed and dozens others were wounded in two car bombings. The attacks came as the U.S. has slowed the number of bombs its dropping on ISIS in Iraq . Smoke rises from the Syrian town of Kobani, seen from near the Mursitpinar border crossing on the Turkish-Syrian border on Monday. The U.S. and it's allies have dropped 21 bombs in Syria in the last days in an effort to slow down the Islamic State's advances there . At a breakfast with reporters last month Odierno cautioned that if the $9 billion in spending cuts included in sequestration are allowed to kick in, the number of active duty soldiers will drop to 420,000 in 2016. That would put the U.S.  at 'significant risk,' he said, and called fiscal year 2016 'the breaking point' for the military. The agreement to cut troops was made before fighting broke out in Iraq and Ukraine, he argued, and it is ill-advised now in light of more recent threat assessments. 'The risk has actually increased. The potential to have ground forces operating on multiple continents simultaneously causes me grave concern about the size of the military, and I think we have to review it,' Odierno said, per Politico. Cuts to the military's budget would bring about 'a significant degradation of readiness,' he explained, and some brigades wouldn't be able to complete the necessary training to be battle-ready. 'I’m not seeing, in ‘16, peace breaking out all over the world,' he noted. Time reports that Odierno also told reporters that U.S. combat forces may be needed in Iraq. 'Airstrikes have slowed the advances of [ISIS],'  Odierno said, according to Time. 'But airstrikes alone won’t defeat [ISIS]. 'You need a complementary ground capability that will go in and do that.' Asked if he would recommend the use of U.S. ground forces if it comes down to it, Odierno said, 'I never rule anything out.' Obama has explicitly promised not put troops back into positions of combat in Iraq, regardless of what happens, even as top generals like Odierno and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey have suggested that circumstances may arise in which they would advise him otherwise. The U.S. has had to slow its air campaign in Iraq as ISIS has changed its patterns and methods to avoid being bombed. In the last two days the U.S. and its allies have launched only one airstrike in Iraq, U.S. Central Command said in a statement, compared to the 21 bombs they dropped on targets in Syria, where fighting has spread in recent weeks to just a mile outside the border with Turkey. On Monday Odierno said he was glad he was to be stepping down at Army chief of staff in a few months so he didn't have to be responsible for deploying troops who aren't prepared to fight. 'I swore that I would never send soldiers into a place not properly prepared, trained or equipped,' he reportedly said. 'I will probably get away with that because I will leave … by the beginning of the next year. 'But I worry for the next chief,' he added.","The military has already cut its active duty forces from a peak of 570,000 down to 510,000 troops .

"Radamel Falcao is tipped to make his Premier League debut for Manchester United on Sunday against QPR, and will be expected to hit the ground running. The Colombian hitman has a formidable striking rate across Europe, and was offered a huge wage by Louis van Gaal upon joining on loan from Monaco. But how has he got on in his first games for his previous clubs? Goals, goals, goals, is the short answer. Sportsmail takes a look at his record. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . VIDEO: Scroll down for Sportsmail's preview for Manchester United vs QPR . Louis van Gaal speaks to Radamel Falcao in training on Thursday as the striker prepares for his debut . Manchester United play QPR on Sunday at Old Trafford and the Colombian striker is set to start . LANCEROS BOYACA, 28 August 1999, Deportivo Pereira, D 2-2 . After making his debut aged just 13, it's hard to criticise Falcao for not hitting the ground running in the Colombian second division. A huge amount of trust was placed in the youngster, and rest assured his first (and only) goal for the club wasn't too far away. Aged just 14, Falcao netted in the 2-0 win against Club El Condor to lift his club off the bottom of the table. A move to a bigger club beckoned. Radamel Falcao is interviewed when he was 14 years old and playing for Lanceros Boyaca . Radamel Falcao made his professional debut for Lanceros Boyaca aged 13, scoring one year later . RIVER PLATE: 6 March 2005, Instituto Cordoba, W 3-1 . Having impressed in the youth ranks for four years, Falcao was finally handed his debut, albeit for four minutes, in a 3-1 win against Instituto Cordoba in the Torneo Clausura. The 19-year-old had little time to impress alongside such stars in the making as Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higuain before bursting into life the following season. Falcao scored twice against Independiente, Lanus and San Lorenzo, before a knee ligament injury in November ruled him out for six months. Radamel Falcao was promoted to the first team at River Plate as a teenager and impressed from the outset . Falcao scored seven goals in seven games before suffering a knee ligament injury . PORTO: 16 August 2009, Pacos de Ferreira, D 1-1 . Porto picked up the prolific frontman for just £3.2million (despite the advances of Aston Villa), and he started to deliver straight away. Replaced Raul Meireles to make his Liga Sagres bow against Pacos de Ferreira and netted in the 78th minute to secure a crucial draw. Scored in each of his first four games while forming a lethal partnership with fellow South American Hulk, though his first game on English soil wasn't so successful; a 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Porto picked up Falcao on the cheap and he netted in his first four games in Liga Sagres . 'El Tigre's' stay in Portugal can be considered to be nothing short of a success . ATLETICO MADRID, 10 September 2011, Valencia, L 0-1 . Brought in to replace Sergio Aguero, the pressure was truly on the Colombian now, possibly for the first time in his career. A 1-0 loss to Valencia wasn't the ideal start for the £41m man, but six goals in his next three games would have put fans at ease, and more. Falcao scored 70 goals in two seasons with Atletico; his reputation as one of the most lethal forwards in the world was secured. Atletico Madrid signed Falcao for around £41m and with the pressure on, he soon started scoring . Falcao scored a stunner as Atletico Madrid beat Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup in 2012 . MONACO, 10 August 2013, Bordeaux, W 2-0 . Real Madrid were tipped to land the striker, but Falcao elected to sign for Ligue 1 moneybags Falcao, albeit only for a season. As per usual the 27-year-old started impressively, scoring on his debut against Bordeaux and netting seven in his first seven games for the club. Monaco were pushing PSG for the title before yet another knee ligament injury, one that he is only just recovering from. One thing's for sure, United can expect an impact from Falcao. They'll just hope it's with his customary goals, not the injuries. Monaco were the surprise suitors for Falcao in 2013 despite the interest of Real Madrid .

"Martin Odegaard, Norway’s youngest ever international is not signing for anyone before the end of Monday's transfer deadline day, according to sources very close to the 15-year-old. Lots of big clubs remain interested in Odegaard, who is currently with the Norway U21 team, including Manchester United and Liverpool. He more than anyone else linked with a transfer today has time on his side. He can wait for six months and move when he’s 16. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 15 Year old Norwegian wonder kid Martin Odegaard highlights . Wanted: Manchester United were discussing possibility of signing Stromsgodset's Martin Odegaard . Record breaker: Odegaard became Norway's youngest ever player at the age of 15 . Centre of attention: Odegaard burst on to the scene earlier this year and has attracted Europe's elite . Born: Norway, December 18, 1998 (age 15) Playing position: Attacking midfielder . 2014-NOW: Stromsgodset (16 apps, 3 gls) 2014-NOW: Norway (1, 0) Odegaard burst on to the scene earlier this year has attracted the attention of Europe's elite. Odegaard's father, Hans-Erik, told Sportsmail: 'We have feet on the ground but we know everything has taken off and there's so much attention on him. I've said to all the agents and the clubs that he is too young to go alone. 'I don't think it's good for any 15 or 16-year-old boy to move abroad to a different country with a different language, different culture, to be alone sitting in a flat, coming in late on February nights, hungry. You need a family to feel secure. 'So if that's going to happen soon, we move with him. And that's not easy because I have a job, working for my father-in-law's textile shops, and we have a family.' Selfie belief: Odegaard takes a picture before his international debut against the UAE . And Stromsgodset manager David Nielsen told Sportsmail: 'We cannot do anything. We're a small club in Norway. We've got a kid that everybody is after. If somebody comes to get him, he will leave. 'It's pretty simple, really. But I still believe the best way for him to develop is by playing first team football and this is one of the only places he is going to play first team football. I think he's at the right place. For at least another year-and-a-half, maybe two years, he's at the right club.' Odegaard made his international debut for Norway on August 27 in a friendly against United Arab Emirates at the age of 15 years and 253 days.

"A teacher at a California high school arrested over the weekend for having sex with her students may have more victims. Amy Corinne Bramlett, 46, was arrested at her home on the 3,400 block of Parkside Drive on suspicion of sex with two boys aged 16 and 17. She was also arrested on suspicion of oral copulation of a child under age 18 and penetration with a foreign object. Arrested: Bramlett is being held on $1 million . According to the Press Enterprise, she was booked into Central Detention Center and bail was set at $1 million. The alleged incidents occurred between January and June of this year. A news release said the encounters took place between January and June in the 7200 block of Sunrise Court in Highland. Records show Bramlett lives on Sunrise. Bramlett was a program specialist at Indian Springs High School when the inappropriate relationships occurred. The 17-year-old was a former student at the school, the 16-year-old was not. High school teacher: One of the alleged victims was a former student of Bramlett's at Indian Springs High School; the other was not . Now, detectives say there may be more victims.

"Out of sight: Rolf Harris pictured with his 2006 portrait of the Queen which has now disappeared . There have been more than 130 official portraits of the Queen since she ascended the throne – many by artists as eminent as Lucian Freud and Dame Laura Knight. All are incredibly valuable and highly sought after. But now one Royal portrait – which Her Majesty posed for in person to mark her 80th birthday – appears to have mysteriously gone missing. The man who captured the Royal likeness was Australian entertainer Rolf Harris, now charged with a string of child sex offences. And in a bizarre game of pass-the-portrait played out by the Royal Collection, the BBC and Liverpool’s Walker Art Gallery, his 2006 picture of the Queen seems to have disappeared from the world of art. Harris’s oil painting – commissioned by the BBC – took two months to paint. The Queen sat for it twice at Buckingham Palace and it was unveiled for her by Harris in the Palace’s Yellow Drawing Room. The artwork shows Her Majesty in a relaxed pose, smiling and wearing a green dress, the first of its kind to depict the monarch in such an informal pose. The Queen wears a three-stranded pearl necklace and a brooch made for her to mark her late mother’s 100th birthday. Harris told reporters at the public unveiling that Her Majesty had described the painting as being ‘very friendly’, although the work was not always well received at the time by art critics. His efforts were filmed by the BBC and shown in a special edition of his programme, Rolf On Art, as part of a series of 80th birthday celebratory documentaries. The portrait hung in the Queen’s Gallery, attached to the south-west wing of the Palace, until 2007 when it was loaned to the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool for several years. The painting left the gallery in August last year. In November, Harris was first questioned by police involved in the Operation Yewtree inquiry, set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal, a process that has led to him being charged with nine counts of indecent assault and four of making indecent images of children. Scroll down for video . Once pride of place: The portrait was first hung in the Queen's gallery at Buckingham Palace, pictured . Now no one is eager to claim ownership of the painting, said to have been worth at least £50,000 before its disappearance. A spokesman for the Walker Art Gallery said: ‘We had the painting on loan from De Montefort Fine Art and the Whitewalls Gallery. 'We then returned the piece and do not have any knowledge about what has happened to it since.’ Mystery: The Palace says that the painting never actually belonged to the Queen . But the Palace claims that the portrait in fact never belonged to the Queen despite it being commissioned to celebrate her birthday. A spokesman for The Royal Collection said: ‘We don’t have it. The portrait was not gifted to the Queen and  was only ever given to us on loan so we could display it in the Queen’s  Gallery. 'There was a great deal of public interest surrounding the BBC programme about the portrait and it  was for this reason that we decided to display it in our gallery. 'The portrait was, to our understanding, commissioned and dealt with by the BBC.’ But a BBC insider said: ‘We don’t have it any more and we don’t know where it is now.’ A spokesman for  the Corporation added: ‘We never owned the artwork. If the piece is not with us or the Palace, it must be in Mr Harris’ personal collection.’ A spokesman for Harris refused to respond to several enquiries about the painting’s whereabouts. And a spokesman at Whitewalls Galleries – also in Liverpool – which owns the bulk of Mr Harris’s other artwork, declined to comment and hung up the phone when asked about the picture. An art world source said: ‘Rolf Harris’s art is a touchy subject. Responsibility is being passed around like hot coals and no one seems to know where it is.’ Portrait: Rolf Harris pictured painting the Queen at Buckingham Palace .

"The Department of Justice may still bring civil charges against Trayvon Martin shooter George Zimmerman, Attorney General Eric Holder revealed on Thursday. Holder told reporters on Thursday that DOJ had not concluded its investigation into the February 26, 2012 incident and the 'matter is ongoing.' 'There are active steps that we are still in the process of taking,' Holder said, according to The Hill. 'There are witnesses who we want to speak to as a result of . some recent developments.' Scroll down for video . Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters yesterday that the Justice Department's investigation into Trayvon Martin shooter George Zimmerman is 'ongoing' Members of the New York City Council wear hoodie sweatshirts in memory of Trayvon Martin, pictured on the poster board, as they stand together on the steps of City Hall in New York during a news conference a month after the 17-year-old Sanford, Florida, resident was shot and killed by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman . Zimmerman and his co-counsel Don West, left, talk during a recess on the first day of jury selection in Zimmerman's murder trial last summer. Zimmerman was ultimately acquitted of the criminal charges but DOJ could still bring federal civil charges against him . Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, was volunteer with his neighborhood watch in Sanford, Florida, when he had the dust-up with Martin that resulted in the 17-year-old African American's death. He was acquitted of murder charges more than a year ago in a criminal court. The Department of Justice could bring its own set of federal civil charges against Zimmerman, however, and it's still looking to, based on Holder's comments Thursday. Justice's continued interest in Zimmerman is unusual as the department . normally concludes it's inquiries within a matter of months. The Hill says the Attorney General didn't offer any additional details on the government's investigation yesterday, such as when it plans to wrap it up. When Holder was asked about Zimmerman last November, the country's chief law enforcement officer didn't give a definitive end date for the probe either but noted that 'a substantial part was resolved in the case that was tried.' 'I'm not sure exactly how much longer that will take, but we will get to . a point where we are able to make a determination,' he said. Holder was questioned again about the Martin shooting on Thursday at a press conference announcing a DOJ investigation related to the shooting of another African-American teen, Michael Brown. In that case, Holder said, DOJ will review the the Ferguson, Missouri, police force to determine if its officers have a 'pattern and practice' of discrimination. The probe follows a month of civil unrest in the St. Louis suburb after one of the mostly black town's white police officers allegedly shot and killed 18-year-old Brown. Brown's family is being represented by the same civil rights lawyer who represented the Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, after he will was killed two and a half years ago. Fulton and Martin have also offered their personal support to Brown's family. The pair traveled to Missouri last month to join the deceased teen's parents at St. Louis' Peacefest rally, an annual event aimed at ending gun violence.","Attorney General Eric Holder said Thursday that the 'matter is ongoing'

"She stands beaming at the immaculate bride, and at the dress she has so carefully designed. Despite the fact L'Wren Scott would never marry her longtime love, Sir Mick Jagger, she poured her heart and soul into making a wedding gown for her close friend, fashion stylist JoJo Cohen. Tragically, it would be the only ever wedding dress that L'Wren would design, worn by JoJo at her wedding in January - just two months before the statuesque brunette would take her life aged 49. Scroll down for video . Haunting: L'Wren Scott puts the finishing touches to the wedding dress she designed for close friend, fashion stylist JoJo Cohen . Happy family: L'Wren Scott's dear friend, Jo Jo Cohen, her new husband Eric Fleiss and his three young children . JoJo, 31, married Eric Fleiss on January 18 in Los Angeles, and pictures in the new edition of Martha Stewart Weddings show the stunning detail on her gown. The blonde chose her friend L'Wren to make her dream dress, saying: 'Her instinct and knowledge of a woman's body were unlike anyone else's. 'We both also shared a love of flowers, and the dress was a magnificent reflection of that, with blossoms everywhere.' The gown was L'Wren's first wedding dress commission, and JoJo recalls: 'L'Wren said it was the greatest honor.' The pair worked together on the design together - 'we spoke the same language from the start', JoJo said - before L'Wren sent the dress to the Royal School of Needlework in the UK. There, the talented artists - who had also worked on the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding gown - embroidered the dress with vintage pearls.

Before her death, Vogue followed her making JoJo's wedding dress as she teamed up with milliner Stephen Jones, who made JoJo's veil. In a video on the fashion bible's website released as a tribute to L'Wren, the 6ft 3ins tall designer can been seen gasping as she sees the intricate embroidery for the dress. She says: 'I got very heavily involved in this dress because it's very intense work when you create something couture for somebody's incredibly special day.'

"Barcelona's La Liga campaign looked set to get off to an unlucky start on Sunday evening as a black cat ran on to the pitch at the Nou Camp in the second minute of their opening league match against Elche. Blaugrana boss Luis Enrique saw the funny side of things in the Barcelona dugout, and was seen laughing and joking with his coaching staff and players on the bench. The black cat, reportedly known as 'Pusskas', spent a couple of minutes evading the attentions of both sets of players and Barcelona staff, with Elche goalkeeper Titon doing his best to sweep the plucky feline into his arms. Barcelona went on to record a 3-0 win thanks largely to two goals from Lionel Messi. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch footage of the cat interrupting the match at the Nou Camp . Marauding run: The cat darted away from a number of Barcelona and Elche players during its spell on the pitch . Pure entertainment: The cat offered more of a threat than Lionel Messi in the early stages at the Nou Camp . 1. In March 2013 a fan let a chicken loose on to the pitch during Blackburn's  1-1 draw with rivals Burnley, reportedly in protest against poultry company Venkys, who own Blackburn. 2. Footballer Luis Moreno was heavily criticised after kicking and killing an owl that ventured on to a pitch during a 2011 match. 3. Four years ago a herd of sheep attacked Tour de France riders during the 174km 17th stage between Pau and Col du Tourmalet. 4. When the England rugby team clashed with Scotland at Twickenham in 2011, a fox stood on the pitch before the game and respectfully observed both national anthems. 5. Argentine basketball star Manu Ginobili managed to catch a bat with his bare hands during a game in 2009. The cat eventually picked up by a member of staff at the Nou Camp, and ushered out of the ground. Twitter exploded with posts about the cat, and within minutes three accounts had been set up paying homage to it. In Spain, like in many European countries, black cats have been considered an object of superstition since the Middle Ages, due to supposedly bringing bad luck and curses to any human they go near. They are also associated with witchcraft. It is not the first time a match at the Nou Camp has been interrupted by a black cat, with one scampering on to the pitch during Barcelona's 2-1 win over Real Sociedad in February 2012. The Catalan giants were not affected by the presence of the cat on that occasion either, and ended a run of three consecutive draws, their worst run of results of the season at that point. It also coincided with Lionel Messi breaking a relative drought in front of goal, as he scored the winner for then coach Pep Guardiola's side. Hot pursuit: A member of staff in the stadium chases the cat across the pitch at the Nou Camp on Sunday . Finally caught: The cat is carried away from the pitch so play can get back underway in Barcelona .

He has scored an incredible 245 goals in 245 league games for Barcelona alone - taking him to fourth in the list of all time scorers in La Liga. Although a relatively quiet season by his standards saw rival Cristiano Ronaldo awarded the Ballon d'Or last term, Messi did top the ratings in the latest FIFA 15 video game with a total score of 93 out of 100. Meanwhile, new Argentina boss Gerardo Martino has slammed the level of media scrutiny directed at those who manage superstars such as Messi, claiming the joy is taken away from coaching such talent. Martino suggests the enormous pressure and constant questioning surrounding Messi means coaches will be criticised regardless of the talisman's performances.

"It’s ballet, but not quite as you know it: As well as the usual ballet attire, these dancers are also wearing their babies. In a new fitness craze sweeping America, Babywearing Ballet is being billed as the perfect exercise class for new mothers, especially those who can’t find a babysitter. It means the little ones pictured here are already doing plies and tendus before they can even walk. For the duration of the class, the mothers practice usual ballet techniques while wearing their newborn babies in a baby carrier or sling. Scroll for video . Dance moms: In Babywearing Ballet classes, participants wear their babies . Raising the barre: Babywearing Ballet is being billed as the perfect exercise class for new mothers . It is claimed that not only do the classes benefit the mothers who get a gentle, safe and effective workout, but the babies too, who enjoy the movement and music, said to emulate the swaying and motion they felt in the womb. Ballet dancer and mother of two Morgan Castner created this class in California. Now an adorable video she posted on Facebook showing her students dancing with their babies has been shared more than 20,000 times. Baby on board: The mothers practice usual ballet techniques while wearing their newborns in a carrier or sling . Quality time: The main focus of the ballet class is bonding between the mother and child . Ms Castner teaches with her nine-week-old daughter Quinn in a sling and came up with the idea two years ago. She explains: ‘My son was 11 months old and with my husband serving in the military, I was looking for fun things we could do together out of the house while he was away. ‘I love dancing and loved babywearing so it was a natural progression. Social network: The class is also a way for new mothers to meet one another . ‘I think Babywearing Ballet has taken off as mothers are embracing the idea and culture of babywearing.’ Ms Castner said she has been overwhelmed by the response to her video since posting it online. She said: ‘It’s crazy, I’ve had so many messages from people wanting to take part and lots are from mothers in the UK who say they wish there were Babywearing Ballet classes there for them to go to.’ Work it out: The class features low-impact toning exercises . Ms Castner added that the main focus of the class was bonding between mother and child. She said it was only natural that babies enjoyed the motion from dance and found it relaxing after being swayed in the womb for nine months. She explained: ‘It’s the perfect class for mum and baby to spend time together. There is no sitter required and mums get to enjoy a low impact toning work out while baby gets to experience all of your movements, rocking motions, soothing classical music and time close to you.’ ‘It’s a wonderful way for mothers to spend time with their babies outside of the house. Maternal bond: The movements are said to emulate the swaying and motion the babies felt in the womb . Head of the class: Morgan Castner, who created Babywearing Ballet, teaches with her nine-week-old daughter Quinn . ‘You are dancing, toning, bonding and meeting other new mothers.’ According to her website, classes begin by warming up at the barre with plies, tendus and desages and move to centre floor work, including upper body port de bras, positions and choreography all while wearing the little one in a sling. She added that Babywearing Ballet was suitable for all levels of fitness and for babies from newborn to any babywearing age.

"Roberto Soldado is compiling quite a DVD of video nasties and produced another horror show as Tottenham crashed out of Europe. As he sprung the Fiorentina offside trap, Soldado had three choices: go round goalkeeper Neto and roll the ball into an empty net, shoot, or pass to Nacer Chadli to his left to leave the Moroccan with a tap-in. Any of those would have given Spurs the lead in the tie. Instead, he chose secret option four, pass the ball straight at Neto in trying to find Chadli.

Subs not used: Vorm, Rose, Paulinho, Mason . Booked: Davies . Manager: Mauricio Pochettino 6 . Referee: Huseyin Gocek (Turkey) 6 . Attendance: 29,886 . MOM: Mohamed Salah . The look on Soldado’s face said it all. He wasn’t the only one as his team-mates tried to comprehend his decision. There was no open goal this time — but in many ways Thursday night’s gaffe was just as bad, if not worse. Within 15 minutes, Soldado was trending on Twitter — above Madonna’s slip at the Brit Awards on Wednesday night. Had the striker done what a player worth £26million should, then Spurs might still be in the Europa League this morning. Instead, they head into Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on the back of this disappointing defeat. However, Soldado shouldn’t shoulder all the blame for Thursday night’s defeat. Jan Vertonghen must also take his share of the flak. Quite how the giant Belgian allowed the diminutive Mohamed Salah to outmuscle him in the box before firing Fiorentina into a 2-0 lead is a question Mauricio Pochettino — who didn’t look at Vertonghen when he was hauled off — will demand answers to. Everyone, including Jose Mourinho, was looking for clues to Pochettino’s team selection ahead of Sunday’s Wembley showdown. And the Argentine, unlike his striker and centre half, didn’t disappoint. Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Danny Rose and Ryan Mason were all left on the bench — a clear indication they will start at Wembley. Nevertheless, this was a bold team selection by Pochettino. Imagine if Christian Eriksen had limped off? The decision to start Eriksen was a risk but it nearly paid off inside 12 minutes when he fell in the box under Stefan Savic’s rash challenge. He appealed for a penalty but to no avail. However, replays showed he did have a case. It was the talking point of a frenetic opening 20 minutes, which saw Eriksen, Milan Badelj and Claudio Pizarro all fail with long-range efforts. Tottenham certainly weren’t overawed, looking to nullify Fiorentina’s away goal in the 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane from the outset. And they would have had it in the 29th minute had it not been for Soldado’s ineptitude following Erik Lamela’s defence-splitting through-ball.

The English full back, who has said he will return to the Premier League in the summer, is sent flying by Vertonghen's challenge . Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah has five goals in European competition, all of which have come against English sides (three v Chelsea, two v Spurs) Pochettino was apoplectic in his technical area. ‘Why would a striker pass up an opportunity to score?’, he was probably asking himself. We’d all like an answer to that question, Mauricio. The night plummeted for Spurs from that moment. Had Turkish referee Huseyin Gocek pointed to the spot when Fiorentina appealed for a penalty, claiming Federico Fazio had handled Gomez’s shot, then Spurs could easily have been behind by half-time. By the 51st minute Tottenham’s bench was a man down after goalkeeping coach Toni Jimenez was sent to the dressing room after arguing with Gocek. And three minutes later they were behind when Mario Gomez raced through one-on-one with Hugo Lloris after Badelj’s defence-splitting pass before coolly slotting home.

Tottenham's Danish midfielder hits his free-kick into the wall during the Europa League clash on Thursday night . Lesson to Soldado: when you’re a striker in a one-on-one, you shoot. Spurs would have been out of the tie had Lloris not thwarted Salah as he raced through on goal in the 61st minute. Pochettino sent for the cavalry, introducing Kane and Andros Townsend in search of an equaliser. It didn’t work. Salah ended Tottenham’s Europa League campaign in the 71st minute, somehow firing past Lloris after Vertonghen’s mistake. The Egyptian, on loan from Chelsea, flung his shirt off in celebration striking a psychological blow for his employers before the final. Soldado will be lucky to have a shirt to wear at all on Sunday. Was fatigue a factor? Spurs have now played 43 games this season, which is more than any other Premier League side. They will certainly be tired of hearing about one historical statistic that rumbles on – Tottenham have never progressed in European competition knockout rounds when they have failed to win the first leg at home. This was a rare start for Micah Richards. In fact it was only his second since Fiorentina’s December 11. In the meantime, he has been an unused substitute eight times, come off the bench twice and had only one start. He is understood to want a move back to the Premier League, with Everton and West Ham keen. His Manchester City deal is up in the summer. - Mohamed Salah just loves tormenting Tottenham and, indeed, any English side. The on-loan Chelsea attacker, who demolished Spurs in this competition in 2013 when he was a at Basle, scored Fiorentina’s second here and was man of the match. He has now scored five in this competition and all five have been against English sides (three against Chelsea and two against Spurs).

"A McDonald's restaurant in Australia has taken to blaring out classical and opera music from its speakers in a bid to stop teenagers hanging around outside. The branch of the fast food outlet in the Mount Annan region of Sydney, New South Wales, began playing the music when the manager became fed up of groups of teenagers loitering late at night. Several weeks since classical music was introduced to the restaurant, its manager claims that the unusual ploy is paying off. Musical deterrent: A McDonalds store in Australia has begun playing classical and opera music from its speakers to deter groups of youths from hanging around (picture posed by models) Matthew Watson told the Macarthur Chronicle newspaper: 'We've noticed a reduction in the number of young people hanging around, but we'll have to reassess it properly in a couple of weeks. 'We play a range of classical and opera music and so far it seems to be working.' Local residents commended the tactic on the newspaper's Facebook page agreeing that it was driving away youths. Sara Carrick posted: 'Great idea and It is working! 'I work nights nearby and it has made a massive difference already to the lingering and loitering in the car park.' But not all residents were as happy with the musical deterrent. Paying off: Several weeks since classical music was introduced to the restaurant, its manager claims that the unusual ploy is paying off . Janeen Brady wrote: 'They turn it up really loud when youth are hanging around the car park. It woke me up at 1am Tuesday night and it's only going to get worse as Xmas approaches.' According to reports, a similar strategy was tried by a local council before in a car park plagued by problem youths. But instead of using classical music, Barry Manilow songs were played from speakers instead.","The restaurant in Mount Annan, Sydney, has seen the number of loiterers reduce .

"The parents of ISIS hostage Peter Kassig have issued another public plea to his captors - emphasizing that he is now a Muslim and wants to 'serve God and teach Islam.' The tweet, sent out on his mother Paula Kassig's Twitter account, was written entirely in Arabic. In the message, they refer to Peter Kassig by his Muslim name: Abdul-Rahman. 'His father and I have done everything in our power to fulfill what you’ve asked of us. We are simple people who are faithful in helping others,' she writes. Scroll down for video . Under duress: Peter Kassig, who now goes by Abul-Rahman has been paraded in front of cameras as the next Western hostage of ISIS . Paula Kassig, Mr Kassig's mother, issued a statement today on Twitter in both Arabic and English pleading for ISIS terrorists to begin negotiating with the family again . 'I beg you in the name of God to please communicate with us so we can discuss the fate of our son who just wants to serve God and teach Islam.' She later posted the message in English, as well. Kassig, a former US Army Ranger turned aid worker, is the fifth hostage to appear on video with brutal executioner 'Jihadi John.' American journalists Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning have all been beheaded in front of cameras after ISIS warned the US and Britain to back down from its airstrikes on ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Mr Kassig's parents, who live in Indianapolis, Indiana, revealed on Monday that they received a horrifying audio recording from their 26-year-old son that had led them to believe his time is running out. Ed and Paula Kassig, from Indianapolis, said it was the first time they have heard the 26-year-old's voice in over a year and he sounded 'like a robot.' The couple, were ordered by ISIS to keep his capture a secret, but when his picture surfaced on TV days ago, they decided to speak out in hopes their son will hear their words. Ed and Pula Kiassig are seen here at a vigil for their son earlier this month in Indianapolis, Indiana . In the audio recording Peter said his life was in jeopardy if U.S. airstrikes did not stop . Sitting in their living room with a school photo of Peter - also known by the Islamic name Abdul-Rahman in the background, Mr Kassig told CBS: 'The dynamics have changed now. Steven's [Sotloff] family kept to secrecy, and he was executed. Peter's name has been listed.' In the audio recording Peter said his life was in jeopardy if U.S. airstrikes did not stop. 'It was just automatic, kind of toneless, as though he was a robot,' Mrs Kassig said. Peter with his mother as a child. He is the Kassig's only child. The couple said they hope their son will learn of their TV appearance - either directly or indirectly - and 'know we are doing everything we can to secure his release' Mr Kassig and his son - he described his horrified reaction one morning at breakfast when a photo of his son flashed across the TV . 'And I'm sure it's because they were insisting what he could say.' He described that his time was running out,' Paul told TODAY. 'His vitality, his spark was not in his voice.' Peter's captors threatened him in a chilling video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning on October 3. The couple told how once the video was made public they moved to a hotel to avoid media attention. Mr Kassig described his reaction one morning at breakfast when a photo of his only child flashed across the TV. 'One minute you look at your scrambled eggs and you look up, it's football. Next minute, look at your scrambled eggs, you look up and there's your son,' he said. 'And you sit there and you have to watch. Everybody's jaw on the place drop. And you gotta fake it, too, 'cause you don't want to stand there and look callous. And inside, you just want to scream. 'Hey, that's my kid.' Just ate it, went back upstairs.' They also speak of the 'demanding' nature of Peter's captors. The Kassigs said ISIS militants have not 'asked' for anything and instead, 'they demand, they simply demand,' Mr Kassig told CBS correspondent Margaret Brennan. Donning a purple jacket and turtleneck top, Mrs Kassig added: 'And their demands have always been ones we cannot accommodate.' Ms Brennan then asked the couple if the demands were 'beyond what is reasonable in terms of money, in terms of power?', to which Mrs Kassig replied: 'In both cases, yes.' Looking down with teary eyes, she continued: 'And we have sent them back messages that we cannot do what you ask. We have tried, but we don't have the power.' In an interview with TODAY they shared portions of a handwritten letter from their son passed on by a former hostage. An inspiration: While in Turkey, Peter (pictured) founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), an emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons . Humanitarian work: It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, that Peter (pictured) was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria . Mr Kassig read from the letter: 'Don't worry, Dad. If I go down, I won't go down thinking anything but what I know to be true, that you and Mom love me more than the moon.' 'He knows that this is bigger than it just being about him,' Mrs Kassig said. 'And we do too.' They explained their son's conversion to Islam saying: 'He was as taken with the religion as he was with the people. 'It was a natural process for him,' said Mr Kassig. Peter, who has been held captive by ISIS for the past year, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier before returning as a medical worker to help victims of war. While in Turkey, he founded SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance), a medically-oriented emergency relief group that serves refugee populations and internally displaced persons. It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, that Peter was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria. In the brutal video showing Mr Henning's death earlier this month, Peter was shown kneeling in the desert while a masked militant condemned President Barack Obama for 'aerial bombardments'. The militant added: 'It's only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.' Emotional plea: Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea  comes just days after they released an emotional YouTube video (pictured), in which they begged their son's ISIS captors to 'show mercy' and free him . Desperate: On Wednesday, the couple appealed directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. Above, Mrs Kassig's tweet, featuring a letter to al Baghdadi . Mr and Mrs Kassig's latest plea to Peter's captors comes just a few days after they appealed directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. Mrs Kassig posted a letter on the social networking site, reading: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child. 'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?' Beheading: On October 3, Mr Kassig was threatened with death in a video showing the beheading of 47-year-old British aid worker Alan Henning (pictured). He was seen kneeling in the sand at the end of the footage . The tweet followed an emotional YouTube video, released by the couple on October 4, in which they pleaded to Peter's captors to 'show mercy and use their power to let him go'. Mr Kassig, a school teacher, who was filmed on a sofa alongside his wife, told militants: 'Our family deplores all human suffering and the loss of innocent life, no matter who is responsible. 'We know that the Syrians have suffered. We also believe violence is not the solution to the problems that trouble us all.' Speaking directly to her son, Mrs Kassig, who was donning a headscarf and clasping a photo of the aid worker in her hands, added: 'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people. Barack Obama  has condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice . 'Our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need.' The  beheading of Mr Henning  followed the murders of three other captives in similar circumstances: U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British aid worker David Haines. U.S. officials have confirmed that Mr Kassig is being held by Islamic State militants, but have declined to give any more details of his capture. The aid worker's family said in a statement earlier this month that they had stayed silent about this news 'at the wish of those who have held their son.' President Barack Obama has strongly condemned the death of Mr Henning and urged that U.S. forces and its allies will bring his killers to justice. 'Mr Henning worked to help improve the lives of the Syrian people and his death is a great loss for them, for his family and the people of the United Kingdom,' the politican said in a statement. 'Standing together with our U.K. friends and allies, we will work to bring the perpetrators of Alan's murder - as well as the murders of Jim Foley, Steven Sotloff and David Haines - to justice.' The President added that the U.S. and other nations will continue to take action to 'degrade and ultimately destroy' the Islamic State group.","Peter Kassig has been threatened with death in a video released by ISIS .

"A woman has revealed her horrific injuries after she was attacked by a pack of raccoons who knocked her to the ground and bit chunks out of her skin while she was walking her dog. Gruesome images show the scores of deep gashes covering Michaela Lee's arms and legs that each needed staples, injections and treatment against rabies. The 28-year-old sustained the lacerations when her dog chased several raccoons up a tree in Fort Steilacoom Park in Lakewood, Washington after he got loose - and they returned to attack. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: Pictures taken after Michaela Lee, 28, was attacked by raccoons while walking her dog in the park show her bloodied, bitten arm . Horrific: Another image, left, shows bite marks on her arm following the attack. Right, she points out the scores . of lacerations covering her body, which were treated . for rabies . When she went to grab the dog's . leash, several raccoons began scratching her legs and when she ran away, . they chased her 75 feet, before knocked her to the ground and biting . her. 'I was trying to run to a neighbour's . front door but the raccoons were between my legs and they tripped me . and I fell,' she told KOMO News. 'They were on top of me, just biting my arms and legs and sides. I was just trying not to let them get to my face.' Her six-year-old American dingo, . Madison, eventually scared them off by barking and snarling, giving Lee . the chance to grab one by the scruff of its neck and throw it away. Mauled: Lee, pictured comforting her dog as she recovers at home, was knocked to the ground by the raccoons as she ran to a neighbour's house for help . Raccoons, which are nocturnal animals, are known to attack dogs left outside homes at night, yet attacks on humans are rare. Animal Control said it is likely a female raccoon felt threatened by Lee or her dog and tried to protect her young. Those attacked by raccoons will need medical care as they carry diseases and parasites. Although cases are rare, raccoons carry rabies, which attacks muscle function and is deadly if not treated immediately. Another worry is the raccoon roundworm, which spreads to people by inhalation of roundworm eggs from raccoon feces. It can cause serious damage to the nervous system and death. Neighbour Michael Parks said he heard . Lee screaming and saw her on the ground. He called 911 and stayed with . two other neighbors to help her.

"Bereaved mother: Tina Wesson, he winner of the 2001 'Survivor', lost her only son, Taylor Collins (pictured), in a car crash last week . The son and brother of 'Survivor' reality TV contestants Tina Wesson and Katie Collins has been killed in a horrific car crash in Tennessee. Taylor Lee Collins, 25, died December 3 when the car he was riding in went off the road in Chattanooga and rammed into the wall of a garage at 20 South Germantown Road.

But the highlight of her career was being flown to the Dominican Republic to tattoo superstar Rihanna at her personal request. Artist Cally- Jo said: ‘That was pretty surreal. Rihanna's hand is probably one of the most famous in the world so it was nerve wracking to know so many people would see my work around the globe. Guess who! Cally-Jo was flown to the Dominican Republic to tattoo Rihanna at the personal request of the singing superstar . The secret's out: Rihanna's new tattoo made headlines around the world - but nobody knew it was the work of young British art graduate Cally-Jo . ‘But it was very exciting and she was a dream to work with.’ The Diamonds singer asked Cally-Jo and a tattoo artist friend to design something incorporating one she already had on her hand and wrist. Rihanna wanted to add to the tribal tattoo she had done in New Zealand. The traditional pattern design was created using a chisel and mallet but Rihanna decided she wanted to expand on it and called Cally-Jo. Cally Jo explains: ‘She wanted a henna look, almost like a piece of decorative hand jewellery.’ ‘Rihanna wanted us to blend in a design that fused with the existing work. Hard at work: The Diamonds singer asked Cally-Jo and a tattoo artist friend to design something incorporating a piece she already had on her hand and wrist . ‘When I was drawing I wanted to create something feminine and sexy that played over the knuckles and wrist. ‘We were drawing on her for about ten hours but the tattoo itself only took one.

But now she is so proud of the name I am making for myself. ‘It’s a privilege to make a living from something I love doing so much. ‘I can’t believe I’ve gone from filling rolls in Subway to hanging out with celebrities and being flown around the world to do something I love.’ Cally-Jo says she developed a love of art and drawing as a child. She says: ‘I was a really creative child and art was always my passion. I knew my future would be about drawing and painting.’ But it wasn’t until she reached her teens that she became interested in tattoo design. She explains:’ My dad had some really old-school tattoos and I used to love looking at them and hearing the stories behind them. ‘It was then I realised I could potentially combine my love of art with body art.’ After leaving school she studied fine art at Eastleigh College and later won a place at the Winchester School of art to study painting. Big names: The young artist has also tattooed actress Sienna Miller, singer Huey Morgan of the Fun Loving Criminals, pictured and goal- keeper Tim Sherwood .

But unable to perform any real inkings until she qualified, she started posting pencil sketches of her designs online. They were an instant hit and she gained her first 150,000 followers in just a few months. She says: ‘I was shocked at the way it spiralled, but really proud that so many people were interested in my work. ‘It was frustrating not to be able to take any bookings though because I wasn’t actually able to use the machine at that point.’ Skills: She graduated with a BA honors degree in 2011. Soon after Cally-Jo started a tattoo apprenticeship to learn her trade . Cally-Jo was stunned to learn American singer Rihanna was following her last year. She says of the moment she found out: ‘One of my friends texted me to say Rihanna  was following me. 'To be honest I thought she had made a mistake but I looked and couldn’t believe it. I knew she was really into tattoos so I was really happy to think she was interested in my work.’ Finally after seven months of training Cally-Jo was able to start tattooing. She was visiting a tattoo artist friend in New York when the call came from Rihanna  last October. Since then she’s tattooed Fun Loving Criminals front man Huey Morgan with one of her own heart designs and actress Sienna Miller who requested an M in honour of her baby, Marlowe.

"It's been ravaged by fire, the roof's caved in, the windows are boarded up and the grass goes past your kneecaps. 'It's totally messed up inside,' adds real estate agent Lee Guo. And this abandoned fibro premises in Western Sydney is all yours for $750,000. The high price of this abandoned South Granville property - a likely knock-down - could be another sign of the high prices that are locking first home buyers out of the market, analysts said. This home in South Granville, in western Sydney, is for sale with an asking price of $740,000 . The roof has caved in, the windows are boarded up, the grass goes past your knees - and there's a spare mattress out the front . If it stays standing, the home would need some work. The interior devastated by a blaze years ago, Mr Guo said. 'It's been burnt. Other things have been broken or missing. You know, even the tiles on the wall, they are all broken,' he said. 'I don't think you can really live inside it.' 'No one (has) lived inside for at least five years. If someone really wants to buy that property probably they have to knock the old house down.' But while the home may be a shambles, the property does have its perks. The squalid home sits on a considerable tract of land - at 570sqm - and it has a 22m frontage. Mr Guo's online advertisement suggested it could be developed to construct a duplex or to 'build your dream home'. The home sits on a considerable 570sqm block of land under R3 zoning, which the real estate agent said is a rare opportunity . An image of the interior, provided by the property group . The property is located just a short drive from the nearby bustling Parramatta CBD and is just a five minute walk from nearby primary schools.

"A group of alleged jewellery thieves used Craigslist to lure victims to California where they would rob them of watches and diamonds worth tens of thousands of dollars. As the FBI closed in on the gang they found a criminal mastermind at the heart of it was an inmate serving 12 years for armed robbery. When agents searched the prison cell of the inmate, identified only as Confidential Human Source (CHS), they found a contraband phone he had allegedly used to run the scam. Search: The gang allegedly used Craigslist to find victims who were selling valuable watches and jewellery . Members of the gang would allegedly lure sellers across the country, paying for their airfare and a limo to collect them, before driving the victims to a remote location where they would be robbed. The gang is accused of carrying out 18 robberies and attempted robberies. Items taken from Craigslist sellers include: . In one case, in July last year, a Middle Eastern man flew from Los Angeles to Oakland with a four-carat diamond worth more than $175,000, and two smaller precious stones. He was intending to sell them to a buyer he had met on Craigslist, and who had paid for his plane fare and limo. The victim realized he had been scammed when the car, that was supposed to take him to a jeweller's or bank, instead drove to a remote location. When the car eventually stopped, three men, including one armed with a gun, robbed the victim who was pistol-whipped and left by the roadside. The case was one of 17 other robberies and attempted robberies listed in a recently released federal search warrant, according to the Daily Dot. Each time the premise was the same. The gang would pose as buyers on Craigslist, pay for the airfare and limo, then rob the seller at a secluded location. Mastermind: The robberies were alleged arranged by an inmate of California's Men's Colony Prison . Jewel theft: In one of the robberies, two 2-carat gems, not pictured, were stolen from a man who was also carrying a $175,000 4-carat diamond . A Cartier watch worth $90,000 and two Rolex watches, one taken from a 23-year-old woman and another from an older victim, were among the items stolen. The FBI were alerted to the gang allegedly behind the heists when two agents on a separate job saw an alleged attempted robbery taking place. In June last year, two agents in Oakland watched as a man waved down a limo and two other men, including one with a gun, approached it. In that case, the driver or potential victim, who had flown in from Denver to sell a diamond, were alerted to the attempted robbery and left before the men could get in the car. A search of phone records of the men, named in court documents as Keegan Leecodi Cotton Jr, Jaedon Evans and Rafael Davis, showed the intended victim was not the first to be targeted. Further cellphone records led the FBI to a suspected gang member who was operating out of  California's Men's Colony Prison. When police seized his contraband phone, its browser history and email inbox was filled with allegedly incriminating conversations with other alleged gang members. The inmate - CHS - had even called Craigslist sellers direct from his cell. 'The browser history on the phone showed the user had been looking at Craigslist sales ads all throughout the country,' Agent Healy wrote in his search warrant affidavit. 'Text messages linked the imprisoned co-conspirator to other identified co-conspirators.' Stolen: A Rolex Pearlmaster, left, and Presidential watch, similar to the ones pictured, were taken . When agents questioned CHS in December he agreed to cooperate after hearing that his son had been implicated by other gang members who had already been arrested. Through questioning the FBI was able to monitor Michael Anthony Martin, one of the last remaining members of the gang. Martin allegedly often arranged the limo rides, often from Avis, to collect potent victims and would either hire an unsuspecting driver or use an accomplice. In December he is accused of providing a limo during what was a FBI sting. An agent, posing as a potential seller, was picked up by a car allegedly provided by Martin. The sting was called off when the agent realized the woman driver was one of Martin's accomplices. After the sting was aborted, Martin called police, saying he needed to know where the limo was because he did not want to accrue extra rental fees, according to documents seen by the Sacramento Bee. Luxury sting: The gang targeted people selling valuable items such as Cartier watches . Martin was arrested last month after the FBI listened in on calls between him and CHS. Over the course of several conversations, Martin allegedly implicated himself in several robberies, including the violent attack on the man selling the diamond. Martin allegedly told CHS he had been nervous since the arrest of three gang members in June. According to an affidavit, he 'looked out the window every morning at 5am, had a bag packed, an escape route, and a motorcycle without a tag'. Shortly afterwards, he was arrested at his Tracy, California home. Police found a pistol there which, because of a previous robbery conviction, he was not allowed to own. Neighbors of 40-year-old Martin, who lived at the home with his wife and two young children, spoke of their shock at seeing federal agents dressed in fatigues and driving an armored car, searching his home. Buddy Kirn told CBS Sacramento: 'It’s not every day you get the FBI busting down the house. They had percussion grenades.' According to Agent Healy, CHS offered to help, stating 'that he is hopeful they will give a better deal to his son' if he ends up facing prosecution.","Gang 'paid for flights and limo for jewel sellers who would then be driven to remote location and robbed'

"With a smile to melt the hardest heart, it’s not surprising little Natalia Goleniowski is taking the modelling world by storm. But what is amazing is Natalia, 5 – who goes by the name of Natty – has Downs Syndrome. When she was born she almost died. Her parents feared she might never learn to walk or talk properly. And aged two she battled with pneumonia and heart surgery. Adorable model: Natalia Goleniowski, 5, was spotted by a photographer when on holiday in Jamaica . Yet she has now been signed up to model the clothes for two prestigious children’s clothes companies. And as well as wowing the modelling world – other companies are also queuing up to feature Natalia in their campaigns - she has started school and is learning to read. 'When Natty was born we didn’t know if she would live, let alone if she would walk or talk properly.  So this is a dream come true,' said proud mum Hayley Goleniowski 42, last night. 'But everywhere we go people stop me to say what a gorgeous little girl Natty is.  And she just adores being in front of the camera.' Babywear company JoJo Maman Bebe agrees. 'When we saw Natalia’s photos we were bowled over by how pretty she was,' said spokeswoman Alice Treharne, 'and we think she will be perfect to model clothes for our 2012 Autumn catalogue.' It’s a world away from the day Natalia – nicknamed Natty - was born. Full-time mum Hayley and her music company boss husband, Bob, 57,  from Padstow, Cornwall, who also have another daughter, Mia, 7, did not expect their second child would be born anything but healthy. 'Apart from some morning sickness, the pregnancy was totally normal,' recalls Hayley, who has had five miscarriages, 'a scan at three months did pick up an unusual thickness in Natty’s neck and we were told this could be a sign of Down’s. But the chance of Natty being Downs was given as 300 to one, which wasn’t enough to go for further tests such as an amnioscentesis. Jumping for joy: Little Natty's enthusiasm is infectious and has turned her into a sought-after child model . 'And as everything else was fine, we didn’t give it any further thoughts.' The couple even chose a home birth. 'It was beautifully calm. I was in the bath and the midwives only arrived shortly before,' says Mrs Goleniowski. But as soon as 6Ib Natalia was born, alarm bells rang. 'Natty was blue and not breathing. It was terrifying. We knew something was terribly wrong when the midwife went into full emergency mode and gave Natty the kiss of life.' An ambulance was called and the pair were rushed to Truro’s Trelisk hospital. There, as her mother lay in shock in a side room, medical staff desperately fought to save Natalia’s life. It was four hours later before a consultant came in and gave the couple the news their daughter was not only critically ill – but had Downs Syndrome. Hayley Goleniowski said: 'When Natty was born we didn¿t know if she would live, let alone if she would walk or talk properly.  So this is a dream come true' 'His actual words were a blur,' says Mrs Goleniowski, 'I was so stunned.  Bob was fantastic – he immediately said, ""well, she’s our baby and we’ll love her anyway,"" and Mia adored her from the start. But I was numb. 'It sounds awful now. But I didn’t even want to see her. It was such a nightmare - I just wanted to go home and forget I’d had a baby.' Things didn’t improve when she got to see Natalia. 'I just looked at her in an incubator and thought, ""you’re not pretty. You don’t even look like my baby"". I felt as if I’d produced an alien.' Doctors warned them Natalia had two holes in her heart and the next few days would be critical. Says Mrs Goleniowski: 'We even had Natty christened in hospital.' Brave little girl: Natty tries out swimming with dolphins . That night the couple went home. But it was when they returned the next morning that mum and daughter began to bond. 'By then I wanted her to live. I suddenly looked at her, lying there amongst bleeping tubes and felt a rush of love. I longed for her to live.' Thankfully after three weeks the couple were able to bring Natalia home. 'But no-one could tell us whether she would walk or even talk properly,' says her mother, 'and she was constantly ill. We were in and out of hospital with pneumonia and she was constantly on antibiotics. Gradually, however – and with intense physiotherapy to help strengthen her limbs – Natalia grew stronger. 'I’ll never forget the day she first sat up by herself. She was ten months and that felt an amazing achievement.' Sleeping beauty: The five-year-old takes a well-deserved nap after playing on the beach . At a year Natalia stunned everyone when she spoke her first word – Teddy. And at twenty months she took her first wobbly steps. Age two she underwent heart surgery to seal the holes in her heart. And from then on she came on leaps and bounds. 'She had so much energy and developed such a little personality.' Then when Natalia was four and the family were on holiday in Jamaica, they were approached by a photographer. 'She was also on holiday and she asked if she could take some photos of Natty.  She was amazed at how photogenic Natty was. Meanwhile, we couldn’t believe how much Natty adored posing for the camera. She loved it.' In September Natalia reached another milestone the family never thought possible – she started mainstream school. Welcome home! Natty's mother, Hayley, initially struggled to bond with her daughter, but big sister Mia (pictured) was always a fan . At the same time Hayley read about a boy with Down's Syndrome in the US who is now a sought after model. 'I decided to write to a couple of clothing companies with a snap of Natty. I never thought anything would come of it. But incredibly both of them immediately emailed back inviting Natty to an audition.' Kurt Jewson co-founder of children’s organic clothing company Frugi says: 'We immediately felt Natty had model potential and are now looking forward to featuring her in our next catalogue and online.' Since then her proud mum has received interest from several other organisations – including holiday companies – requesting to see Natalia for modelling work. She says: 'We are all so proud of Natty. She does shine and it’s wonderful that others see what we do in her.'",Natalia Goleniowski almost died when she was born and had to have open heart surgery when she was two years old .
"The BBC sparked outrage last night over plans to include convicted sex offender Jonathan King in a documentary about rock band Genesis. The disgraced music impresario – who still refuses to apologise to his victims despite spending three and a half years in jail – will be interviewed on BBC2 about his role in the band’s early days. The decision to give him a platform on national TV was immediately criticised by MPs and campaigners. Disgraced Jonathan King (above) – who still refuses to apologise to his victims despite spending three and a half years in jail for his abuse crimes – will be interviewed on BBC2 in a documentary about rock band Genesis . Tory MP Rob Wilson, who said it was ‘astonishing’ the corporation was not more sensitive to victims in the wake of a string of sex abuse scandals involving high-profile presenters. He added: ‘After everything that has happened, you would have thought the BBC would steer clear of convicted paedophiles. 'There is little doubt this will upset King’s victims and further tarnish the reputation of the BBC.’ King, 69, is a former chart-topping star and TV producer who worked on BBC shows No Limits and The great British Song Contest. In 2001, he was convicted of sexual assault on five teenage boys in the 1980s. He was given a seven-year jail sentence and was released on parole in 2005. King has consistently denied the crimes for which he has convicted and refused to apologise to the victims. In 2012, he said: ‘The only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction. I was good at making myself seem attractive when I wasn’t very attractive at all.’ Despite his lack of repentance, King will feature in the new BBC2 film Genesis Together And Apart, which screens on October 4. He gave the band their first big break after he was handed a tape of their music recorded while they were pupils at Charterhouse school. The 69-year-old is a former chart-topping star and TV producer who worked on BBC shows No Limits and The great British Song Contest. He regularly appeared on Top of the Pops (above) with 'It only takes a minute' King will feature in the new BBC2 film Genesis Together And Apart, because of his 'significant role' in putting the band (pictured) together. He gave the band their first big break after he was handed a tape of their music . In the interview, he says: ‘I was a successful pop star - the first act on the London Top Of The Pops show - and of course I went back to Charterhouse in glory in my little Austin Healey Sprite and one of the kids at Charterhouse rushed up to me with a grubby cassette tape, which I still have to this day and said “Ah, this is the school group, listen to it”. ‘I got in touch with them and said ‘I really like the sound of you, I’d like to produce you’ and they said “Yes please”. I gave them the name Genesis because for me that was the start of my production career. ‘I’m not very good with really good creative artists. I’m actually better with people just doing as I say because it’s my work of art I want to do.’ King did not receive an appearance fee from the BBC, but campaigners said it was wrong to allow him to rehabilitate his image on television. Pippa Smith, of campaign group Safermedia, said: ‘This seems completely inappropriate. It sends out all the wrong messages and shows how broadcasters are out of touch with the real world and have not learned the lessons of Savile.’ King (pictured leaving Staines Magistrates' Court in 2000) was convicted of sexual assault on five teenage boys . It is not the first time the BBC has been criticised over King. In 2011, then BBC director general Mark Thompson apologised to the disgraced star after he was cut from a repeat of a 1976 spisode of Top Of The Pops, on which he performed It Only Takes A Minute. After King complained the decision to cut him was a ‘Stalinist revision of history’, Mr Thompson said the omission ‘should not have happened’, adding: ‘We would like to apologise for any upset this caused.’ The BBC’s decision to include King in the documentary conflicts with its policy on former DJ Jimmy Savile. It has a policy of removing all archive footage of Savile ‘where the material is likely to cause offence to his victims’ and removed his Desert Island Discs interview from its archive. A BBC spokesman said: ‘As Jonathan King played a significant role in discovering Genesis during their early years he appears briefly in the documentary.'","Jonathan King will appear in film because of his 'role' in discovering Genesis .

"A British banker accused of murdering two prostitutes in Hong Kong tried to kill himself because he was under so much pressure at work, a former girlfriend claimed today. The woman said Rurik Jutting became depressed after suffering from 'financial problems' and other 'issues' while working for investment bank Merrill Lynch. He appeared in court today charged with the double murder after the bodies of two sex workers were discovered in his flat in the former British colony in the early hours of Saturday. His ex-girlfriend, who did not wish to be named, said Jutting had discussed having suicidal thoughts with her in the past. 'Insane psychopath': British banker Rurik Jutting has been charged with the murder of two prostitutes found butchered at his Hong Kong flat. He is pictured here with Ariane Guarin, also known as Yanie, who is believed to one of the trader's ex-girlfriends, but not the one making the claims about his attempts to kill himself . She told Channel 4 News: 'Every time we met he was always stressed because of work. He told me that he had financial problems and some issues with stuff. 'Last October, he told me that he tried to kill himself. I think (it was) because he was under pressure with his job. He was depressed.' Jutting is accused of killing Indonesian sex workers Sumarti Ningsih and Jesse Lorena after picking them up from clubs in Hong Kong's red light district. Three days ago – on Halloween – he updated his Facebook with the words: 'Money DOES buy happiness.' The bloodbath has yet to be explained, but Cambridge-educated Jutting's final 'update' to his wealthy friends and family is a small, if baffling, insight into his state of mind around the time of the killings. His parents' home: The £1.1million Victorian house in Surrey where his parents Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, live . The 29-year-old financier with investment bank Merrill Lynch certainly had a taste for the high life. He dined with a string of beautiful women in exclusive restaurants across the globe, according to those who know him. He enjoyed skiing holidays in Courchevel, the Alpine playground for the elite, and when in London he relaxed at a private members' club in Shoreditch. The son of an engineer father and a nursery teacher mother, Jutting was described by one colleague in Hong Kong as someone who 'talked very loud and made loads of money'. Earning a six-figure sum as an equity trader and living in luxury in one of the most vibrant cities in the world, Jutting was apparently going from strength to strength. Grand: Before his parents' moved to their current home (above), Jutting lived with them in Grade II-listed house . But for reasons that are unclear, he appears to have mysteriously quit his job in the days around the first murder. 'He always seemed so sad – he never said hello to any of us or smiled,' said an employee who works in the skyscraper where Jutting lives, and who saw him being led away by police at around 4am on Sunday. Jutting had been in Hong Kong since July 2013, having transferred from Merrill Lynch's London office where he had worked since July 2010, according to his profile on LinkedIn. Prior to that, he worked as a trader in capital markets at Barclays in London. Once physically fit, Jutting had been a member of the lightweight rowing club and the cross-country running club at Cambridge University, where he studied law and history at Peterhouse College in the mid-2000s. Heritage: The property his parents' live in inspired the illustrations in 'The Wind in the Willows' He was also the secretary of Cambridge University's history society, which is called Clio, whose honorary members include intellectual heavyweights such as philosopher Professor Roger Scruton and the historian Dr David Starkey. A senior member of the university told the Daily Mail: 'He was a bit of an action man, always on the move. I never heard about him getting into any serious trouble, so this comes as a real surprise.' Prior to Cambridge, Jutting studied at £34,000-a-year Winchester College – motto: 'Manners makyth man'. One contemporary at the independent boys' school, Thomas MacThomas, wrote on Twitter yesterday: 'So I knew Rurik Jutting when at school. Kinda disturbing. He was quite strange.' As teenagers, Mr Jutting and his younger brother lived with their parents in a Grade II-listed house in Chertsey, Surrey. A neighbour there said yesterday the family were 'nice enough' but were 'quiet and kept themselves to themselves'. After Rurik moved away to Cambridge, his parents, Graham, 53, and Helen, 52, moved to a grand Victorian manor worth £1.1million in the nearby commuter town of Cobham.

He also 'liked' a Facebook page with photos of provocatively dressed Asian women. In one of his last postings, Jutting seemed to suggest all was well in his world. He posted a comment, copied from the internet, which read: 'Is 29 the perfect age? I feel more secure, I'm a better friend and I know my limitations. No wonder 29-year-olds are the most popular age group.' Only hours later, he was phoning the police to allegedly confess to murder.

"The wife of a Palestinian imprisoned in Israel has given birth to a boy conceived after her husband's sperm was smuggled into Gaza, her family said. Hana al-Za'anin delivered baby al-Hassan after she was successfully inseminated - the first time such a procedure has been successful in Gaza - after six similar pregnancies in the West Bank. Many political prisoners in Israel are denied conjugal visits, and Palestinians view such births as an act of defiance against jail policies. Secret children: The wife of a Palestinian imprisoned in Israel has given birth to a boy conceived after her husband's sperm was smuggled into Gaza (pictured is another birth as a result of smuggled sperm insemination) ‘I am tired and very, very happy,’ said new mother Hana al-Za'anin said after the birth. Speaking from a hospital bed in Gaza City, she said Israel banned her from visiting her husband Tamer upon his arrest in 2006, citing unspecified ‘security reasons.’ Most of Gaza's 1.8 million people are barred from entering Israel for the same reason, although it allows some merchants and seriously ill people to enter its territory from Gaza. Gaza has been run by the Islamist group Hamas since 2007. Israel has enforced a blockade on the territory and has fought a round of bloody battles with the militant party. Al-Za'anin declined to say how the sperm was conveyed out of prison, but said its journey to a medical lab in Gaza, where two specialists were waiting for it, took around six hours. Tamer was arrested in an Israeli army incursion into the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun and jailed for 12 years for belonging to the Islamic Jihad militant group. Another success: Last year, Palestinian Dalal al-Ziben, 34, gave birth on the West Bank, 16 years after her husband was handed 27 life sentences in Israel . The new grandmother clutches a photograph of her imprisoned son, Tamer, and her newborn grandson . ‘Today a hero was born to a hero,’ the prisoner's 22-year-old brother Tareq, a hairdresser, said with a laugh. Israel regards 5,000 or so Palestinian prisoners in its jails, many imprisoned for killing civilians, as terrorists. The insemination of prisoners' wives led to six pregnancies in the occupied West Bank in 2013, as clinics have become more advanced, community awareness has increased and religious clerics are blessing the practice. 'Today a hero was born to a hero,' said Tamer's brother as new mother Hana lies in hospital surrounded by photographs of her husband who was jailed for being a member of the Islamic Jihad militant group . Religious clerics are now blessing the practice as political prisoners are not allowed conjugal visits . ‘750,000 Palestinians have been arrested by Israel since 1967 - many serve long sentences,’ said Doctor Salem Abu Khaizaran of the Razan Medical Center in Nablus, a West Bank facility that aided the pregnancies. ‘The families suffer, and our services provide a way out.’ Palestinians say their prisoners are fighters in a political struggle and deserve more protection under international law. They are rankled by the Israeli government's decision in 2006 to allow the Israeli assassin of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to conceive a son through conjugal visits.","Prisoner's wife gives birth after being inseminated with 'smuggled sperm'

"Kelsey Grammer forgave the man who raped and murdered his sister but said that he should not be released, during an emotional testimony at the killer's parole hearing on Tuesday. The 59-year-old Frasier star testified against 57-year-old Freddie Glenn who kidnapped and murdered his 18-year-old sister, Karen Elisa Grammer, in 1975 when she was leaving her job at a Red Lobster in Colorado Springs. 'I accept that you live with remorse, but I live with tragedy every day,' the Cheers star said via satellite link at a Colorado parole hearing. 'I accept your apology. I forgive you. However, I cannot give your release my endorsement.' Scroll down for audio of Kelsey Grammer's testimony . Kelsey Grammer, pictured in May, said on Tuesday that he forgave murderer and rapist Freddie Glenn (right) for killing his 18-year-old sister Karen in 1975 but that he should not be granted parole . The actor said that to bless the idea of Glenn’s parole 'would be a betrayal of my sister’s life'. A prison spokeswoman said on Wednesday that Glenn's parole request has been denied. He will next be eligible for parole in 2017. Glenn and accomplice Michael Corbett snatched Miss Grammer on July 1, 1975, while she was  outside the Red Lobster restaurant, waiting for her boyfriend to finish work. The thieves had tried and failed to rob the restaurant and reportedly thought that the 18-year-old, who was sitting in her car, could identify them. A life cut short: Karen was a teenager when she was kidnapped, raped and murdered after leaving her job at a Red Lobster in Colorado in 1975 . She was repeatedly raped over four hours at an apartment, according to KKTV. She was then told she would be let go and released from a car at a mobile home park. Glenn, who according to the trial had taken LSD, then slit the teenager's throat and left her on the ground. She managed to make it to a nearby home for help but no one was home and she died on the back porch. Her body was identified a week later by Kelsey Grammer. Glenn was convicted of killing Miss Grammer and given the death penalty. The Supreme Court later overturned that decision and allowed him to seek parole after 30 years. He also was convicted of killing another two men. Glenn murdered motel cook Daniel Van Lone, 28, in a robbery from which he took 50 cents on June 19, 1975. On June 27 that year, he killed 19-year-old Army soldier Winfred Proffitt over drugs. The Denver Post reported Glenn was tearful at times as he apologized during Tuesday's parole hearing. The murderer was 18 years old when he murdered Miss Grammer.  He told the court he believed that he deserved a second chance. He added that he has a fiancée and a $200,000 trust fund that could help stabilize his life after being released from prison. Glenn is locked up at Colorado’s Buena Vista Correctional Facility. 'I want to believe you have actually . changed your life … things you say, I accept a lot of it,' Kelsey Grammar said on Tuesday. He then asked: 'If someone did to your sister what you did to mine, what would you think should be done to him?' Glenn answered: 'I would be hurt, and I would be angry. I would like to think one day I would forgive.' The last time Mr Grammer blocked Glenn's parole was in 2009. At that hearing, Chuck Heim, who investigated the murder described Miss Grammer's murder as 'vicious'. According to KKTV, he said: 'She crawled up on a back porch, where there was a light, but the homeowners were out. You could see bloody hand prints and finger prints where she tried to reach the doorbell for help and she died there.' Mr Grammer, who was delayed from attending the 2009 parole hearing due to bad weather, sent an emotional letter to the jury about the effect that his sister's brutal death had on him. He wrote: 'She was my best friend and the best person I knew. She had so much to live for. I loved my sister, Karen. I miss her. I miss her in my bones. 'I was her big brother. I was supposed to protect her - I could not. I have never gotten over it...It very nearly destroyed me.'

"Lauren Oliver, 25, has described her daughter Harper (pictured together) as her 'little miracle' after giving birth to her just hours after being stabbed . A mother has told of her delight of her ‘miracle’ baby after she gave birth by emergency c-section just hours after being stabbed in the stomach. Lauren Oliver, 25, was heavily pregnant when she suffered multiple stabs wounds in the alleged attempted murder attack at her home in Belton, Lincolnshire. Due to her injuries, doctors performed an emergency caesarean and her daughter, Harper, was delivered just hours later. The newborn, who was delivered at 33 weeks weighing 4lbs 1oz, remains in intensive care although both she and her mother are said to be ‘doing well’. Miss Harper, who is already a mother to six-year-old Ruby, said the baby girl is ‘her little miracle’. The riding instructor said: ‘Harper is doing really well, she’s a fighter. ‘We’ve had loads of people coming to see us, loads of cards, loads of support. ‘I’m just so happy everything has turned out okay. Of course there was a moment when I thought she couldn’t live to be a week old so it’s really good to see her doing so well. ‘She was just so tiny when she was born, the size of a little doll. ‘I’ve been able to hold her quite a bit when they take her out of the incubator, and she is taking milk. ‘She was on a ventilator for the first four days of her life but thankfully she’s breathing on her own now, that’s a real relief. ‘It didn’t feel real when I held her for the first time. It was just the best feeling ever. I didn’t think she would be there. I can’t describe how happy I was. ‘She’s perfect. We are both so lucky. ‘Ruby absolutely loves her and can’t wait for us all to go home. ‘At the moment we have no idea when that will be. We are just taking one day at a time.’ Miss Oliver, who already had a six-year-old daughter called Ruby (left), gave birth to Harper via an emergency caesarean after suffering multiple stabs wounds in the alleged attack at her home in Belton, Lincolnshire . Nicholas James Leaning, 28, of . Scunthorpe, has been charged with one count of attempted murder and one . count of attempted child destruction in connection with the alleged attack last . Wednesday. He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Hull Crown Court, East Yorkshire on Monday. Neighbours of the young mother have spoken of their shock of the alleged attack, and their relief that both are now on the mend. Next-door neighbour Matthew Rawson, 28, said: ‘Lauren is a fun and bubbly girl...very genuine and a great mum. ‘My kids adore her. We’re a close community and we are all so relieved they are both fine. Nothing like that’s happened round here before.’ Harper, who was delivered at 33 weeks weighing 4lbs 1oz, remains in intensive care although both she and Miss Oliver are said to be 'doing well'. A man has been charged in connection with the alleged attack . Another 50-year old neighbour told how Miss Oliver was taken to hospital by ambulance as the air ambulance hovered overhead. The woman, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘I can’t imagine how her family feel and what they must have gone through. Lauren’s a hardworking young mum and a friend of my daughter’s. ‘Thank goodness they made it through. Someone must have been watching out for them that day.’ Police are continuing to appeal for anyone with information to come forward, particularly those with knowledge of a silver Ford Focus and red Seat Leon which may have been seen in the Ashtree Close area on the day of the alleged assault.

"The sister of a Muslim fanatic who died in Syria after bragging about his ‘5-star jihad’ was arrested today by police investigating a Syria-related terrorism plot. Tamannah Shaharin, 29, idolised her jihadi brother Iftekhar Jaman. The 23-year-old chef from Portsmouth became one of the most infamous British extremists when he boasted on BBC Newsnight that the ‘holy war’ in Syria was like ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature.

The family’s business, Masala Takeaway in Portsmouth, was also raided. Yesterday, just hours before the police raid, Mustakim wrote on Twitter: ‘Sometimes you have to take a side or you will be held accountable for your inaction.’ Jaman, a former Sky call centre worker, left the UK last year after telling his parents he was going to study in Turkey, but he slipped across the border to Syria on May 14.

"Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged after months of abuse on Ask.fm . Website bosses claim the teenager who killed herself after being bullied online sent most of the vile abuse to herself. Hannah Smith, 14, hanged herself in her bedroom ten days ago after being targeted by trolls on Ask.fm. But the social networking site insists that she set up most of the anonymous identities used to bombard her own page, it has been reported. A source at the firm based in Riga, Latvia, said: ‘With the Hannah case, the company have looked at every identity – the [computer] IP addresses are trackable. She posted the anonymous things herself.’ Last night Hannah’s father David, 45, reacted with anger to the allegation. ‘Hannah was a 14-year-old girl who was being bullied and she took her own life,’ he said. ‘Ask.fm is trying to cover its own back by discrediting Hannah. It’s disgusting.’ The firm claims that up to 98 per cent of the messages sent to Hannah came from the same IP address as her own computer. Only four posts were sent from a different machine, it has been reported. Ask.fm allows users to ask questions or invite them from other members but they can remain anonymous, allowing trolls to pick out victims.Mr Smith, a lorry driver from  Lutterworth, Leicestershire, added that the issue was not if Hannah had sent any of the messages. ‘She was bullied online,’ he said. ‘Whether she wrote some of it herself doesn’t make any difference. ‘A 14-year-old girl has taken her own life because she was being bullied on the internet. ‘If Hannah did do some of it herself, then it just shows how desperate she was.’ Mr Smith said Ask.fm should be working to stop the abuse instead of deflecting blame for Hannah’s death. ‘Ask.fm has information to say that Hannah was being bullied but they have not passed on that  information,’ he said. ‘They are  trying to discredit a 14-year-old girl who has committed suicide. ‘They have not once been in touch with me. Hannah has touched a lot of hearts. But they are trying to  discredit her because this company was making millions.’ Marks . Terebins, Oskars Liepiøö, Ilja Terebins, who founded Ask.fm, An . internal investigation is said to have revealed that 98 per cent of the . messages were sent  from a computer with the same IP address as Hannah's . Row: Ask.fm has said previously it does not take responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts . Last night, a source close to Ask.fm said it was conceivable that Hannah may have posted some of the hate messages herself. The source told the Daily Mail: ‘It is possible for a user to write something anonymously on their own wall. ‘Only Ask.fm administrators can tell exactly which computer was used to post questions and answers through the IP address. ‘This is how they can work out who has posted the messages.’ Hannah’s is the fourth death linked to the social networking site after Josh Unsworth, 15, from Lancashire, in April and two girls in  Ireland last autumn, Erin Gallagher, 13, and Ciara Pugsley, 15. David Cameron has urged parents to stop their children using Ask.fm, which attracts 60million global users. A 16-year-old boy from Belgium has been identified as the troll who sent taunts to Hannah the day before she died. Mr Smith told the Daily Mail he had seen evidence the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was targeting his daughter. But he maintained that identifying him would not protect other children as only regulating the internet would be effective. ‘Catching this boy won’t make any difference, it won’t make the internet safer,’ he said. ‘The only way is to bring in controls.’ The mother of the millionaire Russian playboys who launched Ask.fm insisted that they are not to blame for Hannah’s death and instead turned the spotlight on parents. Ludmila Terebin, whose sons Ilja, 34, and Mark, 29, set up the site in 2010, said: ‘What are they guilty of? I think we’d better look instead at the parents of these teenagers and at the way they brought them up. ‘Of course, I sympathise with them. But, I’m sorry, it is all to do with how you raise them. ‘I would worry if my child stayed online a lot.’ Leicestershire Police are analysing Hannah’s computer and said they would consider charges if any offence was uncovered. A spokesman said: ‘Hannah’s death is not being treated as suspicious and a file is being prepared for the coroner.’ A vile internet troll who mercilessly bullied teenager Hannah Smith into killing herself has told how he is now terrified he might go to jail. The 16-year-old, from the historical city of Tongeren in Belgium, is being tracked by police after revealing himself on another social network, the Sunday Mirror reports. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, posted his fears on mobile messaging app Kik. Taunts: Hannah's father David Smith, pictured with his other daughter Jo, said he was contacted by a boy online who said he was in touch with the boy who sent the messages . He wrote: 'This is so srs (serious) i think i might go to jail. 'you . no that girl that's all over the news and s**t... hannah!? The day . before she died i was sending her a load of abuse get cancer kill . yourself e.t.c i didn't think it would go this far.' Another . boy reportedly forwarded the message on to Hannah's father lorry driver . David Smith claiming the troll had wanted to meet him but had changed . his mind. Mr Smith told the Mirror: 'I was speaking to one lad who said he was in touch with the boy who sent the messages. 'He . was going to come round but changed his mind. I called the police and . they said that this was valuable evidence as it gives them individuals . to investigate.' But incredibly Mr Smith said he did not want her abusers to be sent to prison as he believed it would be a 'pointless exercise'. Tragic Hannah, 14, from Lutterworth, . Leicestershire, was found hanged in her bedroom after . suffering months of abuse by bullies on the social network Ask.fm . He said: 'I would just like to see . the people who bullied Hannah and ask them ""why?"" I want them to say . sorry and to see the pain they have caused. 'They will have to live with the guilt of what they have done for the rest of their lives. If they came and apologised. 'I still want justice and see them arrested but I don't want to see them go to prison. That won't bring Hannah back.' Hannah's body was discovered in her . bedroom by her sister Jo, 16, who is now so traumatised by the . experience that she is refusing to go upstairs alone. The family has been sleeping on sofas downstairs and David says they have now decided to sell the property.","Executives at Ask.fm carried out internal investigation into abusive posts .

"He’s been wreaking havoc in Switzerland for weeks, but now a crack team of Austrian hunters have caught the wild bear that developed a taste for picnic food. The real life Yogi Bear became public enemy number one in the snowy Graubunden region after reports of him raiding beehives and bins and stealing food from unsuspecting campers. Caught: 'Yogi' bear who has been causing chaos in Switzerland by stealing from picnickers has finally been trapped . The enormous animal also mistook a skidoo for a giant tasty treat and began tucking in with his powerful teeth. He ripped off large chunks of the ice machine before realising it was inedible. After launching a bear hunt authorities finally managed to stop the beast in his tracks by shooting it with a tranquiliser gun. ‘Yogi’ has now been set free again, but not before he was fitted with a GPS system to ensure that when he wanders into areas inhabited by humans hunters can shoot him with a special type of rubber bullet to scare him away. Enforced sleep: The bear was tied up and muzzled after being shot by a tranquiliser gun so he could be fitted with a GPS device . Hannes Jenny from the Hunting and . Fishing Authorities in Switzerland said: ‘The problem is that the bear . has lost his fear of human beings. Not quite smarter than the average bear: The real life version of the cartoon Yogi Bear has been caught in the wilds of Switzerland . ‘Normal . rubber bullets don't affect bears but the cartridges we plan to use . contain lots of small rubber pellets designed to drive the bear off. ‘That should teach him to avoid man in the future. ‘We want him to get his food naturally in the woods.’ Officially the bear is known by his scientific name M13 but unofficially he has become known as ‘Yogi’. Mr Jenny added: ‘We were able to confirm that it is the same bear that been causing problems elsewhere in the area. He weighs 120 kilos at the moment.’ Prior to the capture and tagging of M13 officials in Austria and Switzerland had warned hikers to be on the lookout for the animal. Wildlife experts said that the bears were notoriously drowsy after waking up from their long winter sleep and often showed a very bad temper. M13 had also shown himself to be lazy in simply stealing from man and had probably been confused from his long winter sleep when he tackled the skidoo. Mr Jenny said it was an unusual exercise for police who had to take DNA samples of the hair left by the bear at the scene in order to help the scientists to identify the beast.","Bear stole food from campers in the Graubunden region of Switzerland .

"This is the dramatic moment the former home of a celebrated Victorian poet suddenly collapsed into a pile of rubble after a workman removed a single brick.

One eye witness said: 'He was up there trying to make it safe and he obviously took out the wrong brick. The whole lot came down with a loud rumble,' one said. It is believed no-one was hurt during the drama. A blue plaque mounted on the front of the building marks the fact it was once home to poet Francis Thompson who lived there between 1864 and 1885.

Gone: The building, which was once home to the Victorian poet Francis Thompson, collapses into a pile of rubble . The son of a doctor and Roman Catholic convert, Francis Thompson was born on December 16, 1859 in Preston, Lancashire. After studying medicine he moved to London as a young man to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. But he would soon fall upon hard times being forced to sell matches and newspapers for a living. Then, after becoming addicted to opium which he first took as a medicine for ill health, he became a tramp sleeping rough by the River Thames. He was saved by a young couple who, impressed with his work, found him a home and published his first book of poems in 1893. But Thompson would continue to struggle with his opium addiction for most of his life. He moved around the country living in extreme poverty as an invalid in Wales and Storrington. At one point he even attempted suicide, later claiming he was only saved by a vision of the poet Thomas Chatterton, who had committed suicide almost a century earlier. He was befriended by a prostitute who took him in and gave him money. Although he never revealed her identity he would describe her in his poems as his saviour. Thompson's most famous work is the haunting poem The Hound of Heaven which describes the pursuit of the human soul by God. It includes the lines: 'My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap. My days have crackled and gone up in smoke. Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.' Other notable works include the famous cricket poem At Lord's and a treatise On Health and Holiness, which was published two years before his death in 1905. Among his biggest fans was a young J.R.R. Tolkien, who described him as an important influence on his own writing . Thompson died from tuberculosis in 1907 at the age of 48. He was buried in St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery in London.","Locals had raised concerns falling debris from the two-storey property .

"She has known the joys of winning gold at the Olympics but the greatest day of Rebecca Adlington’s life took place far from any swimming pool. The 25-year-old married the love of her life – and then told how taking part in I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year inspired her to get in shape. Miss Adlington, who tied the knot with fellow swimmer Harry Needs at The Ashes, near Leek in Staffordshire, told Hello! magazine: ‘I lost nearly two stone in the jungle and perhaps another four or five pounds since then. So it was a great kick start, and I feel better for it. Scroll down for video . Rebecca Adlington, 25, married fellow swimmer Harry Needs at The Ashes, near Leek in Staffordshire . Miss Adlington said that taking part in 'I’m A Celebrity' last year inspired her to get in shape . ‘But I don’t like it when people assume you’re really happy because you’re thin. I’m not suddenly confident because I have lost weight, I’m happy because I’m marrying the love of my life.’ In the lead up to the wedding, the former swimmer followed a Harley Street clinic’s weight loss and detox programme. And she capped it off by spending a week at the clinic’s French retreat, which costs up to £3,295 per person. She embarked on a strict programme of vegetable juices, daily yoga and meditation sessions and long walks in the countryside at a secluded chateau in Provence along with her friend, fellow retired swimmer Katherine Wyld.

"ISIS appears to have copied the opening credits of hit TV show Homeland to introduce the beheading of US journalist Steven Sotloff. Homeland opens with rough cuts between poor quality footage of news reports, CCTV, and a speech by Obama declaring: 'We must and we will remain vigilant at home and abroad'. Almost identical, the prelude to the brutal Islamic State video shows Obama's reaction to the murder of US journalist James Foley, in which he states: 'We will be vigilant and we will be relentless'. Experts have branded the technique a clear move by the extremist group to lure Western recruits using themes from popular culture that romanticise warfare and terrorism. Dr Andreas Krieg, of the Department of Defence Studies at King's College London, told MailOnline the videos are a 'means of psychological warfare' that offer young Muslims 'the illusion to escape the rigid world of boredom'. Copy? The  Homeland opening credits (left) uses poor-quality footage of Obama declaring 'we will remain vigiltant'. The ISIS video released yesterday (right) does the same with Obama saying: 'we will be vigilant' 'They know that these demonstrations of power when wrapped nicely can attract young Muslims and particularly young converts to Islam to join their ranks,' he said. 'To a degree they offer youngster the illusion to escape the rigid world of boredom they live in in the West. IS provides a cause to fight for and a platform to become something you are not.' Both Homeland and the latest ISIS video - entitled A Second Message to America - have deliberately shaky camera shots and special effects to interfere with the colour balance and sound quality of the video. They both fade in and out from President Obama with Arabic subtitles on the screen. In the latest video broadcasting the murder of US journalist Steven Sotloff, ISIS uses a few seconds of President Obama speaking in a similar manner to the opening scenes of the hit TV series which is shown on Channel 4. In the terrorist video, the producer uses commercially available video editing technology to mimic the the techniques used in Hollywood. According to one video expert who spoke with MailOnline, both clips are in black and white so the colour saturation had been dropped. 'The image in Homeland flips over – the visuals in this use a scroll effect. 'In Homeland the title sequence is a stream of consciousness you see Carrie waking and sleeping. They have put a filter on the footage so it appears that it is someone else watching this. The President is shown giving a speech addressing the threat posed by the fictional terrorists . His speech is cut into a Middle Eastern news broadcast with Arabic script at the bottom of the screen . One Twitter user believes that those behind the ISIS broadcasts are from the west . 'In Homeland they use Arabic subtitles at the bottom of the screen faded into a news report. In the ISIS video the Arabic subtitles are also at the bottom of the screen beneath President Obama. 'ISIS has also put a crackle on the audio of President Obama's speech to make it sound more ""edgy"".' In the Homeland excerpt President Obama is reported as saying 'we must and will' remain vigilant at home and abroad. In the ISIS version he says we ""will continue to do what we must do to protect our people, we will be vigilant and we will be relentless"".' Many of the videos are produced by the Al Hayat Media Centre, which is the terrorist organisation's communications department. According to Dr Krieg: 'They are trying to appeal to new recruits in the West. They are staging these beheadings in a particular way by using themes from popular culture – the series Homeland might come to mind.' Sickening: Mr Obama vowed that 'justice will be served' after Steven Sotloff (pictured) was killed on video . Threatened: This image is believed to show ISIS militant Jihadi John  and the British hostage he has threatened to murder next. The video was released two weeks to the day another video showing the execution of American journalist James Foley was released online . Dr Krieg said one of the benefits for ISIS in showing these executions is that it has a psychological impact on their opponents. The extremist group now presides over a mass of land equivalent to the size of the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq, and controls at least four million people. He said: 'The fact that Iraqi Army units abandoned their posts in Mosul in June shows that IS succeeded in spreading fear. They have built a reputation of being ruthless. In this respect these videos are a means of psychological warfare. 'Third, these videos are a direct means of communication with the West. They want to outrage Western publics and governments to lure them into taking a more active role in Iraq and Syria. It is a bait that the West should refrain from taking.' Another murder: It comes just two weeks after another video showing the beheading of another U.S. reporter, James Foley, was released by the Islamic State . In the ISIS version, the President's voice is distorted slightly by a cackling sound to make it more 'edgy' The ISIS version also deliberately interferes with the image, taking away the colour, copying a TV drama . The ISIS video also uses an Arabic script subtitle at the bottom of the screen, partly as a branding exercise . Video released Tuesday by the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) showed American journalist Steven Sotloff (L) next to an unknown jihadi shortly before his execution by beheading . He continued: 'Because the more the West gets directly involved in the Muslim World the more they will alienate local Muslims. IS will then use this alienation to get support from these rather moderate Muslims. As soon as IS can make a case that the West is the near enemy in the Muslim World, the more dangerous the ideology of IS becomes for the West. The reason is that they will give IS legitimacy in continuing their otherwise very un-Islamic jihad.' Dr Krieg said he feels the most video is 'an act of desperation' on behalf of ISIS as most people have rejected their ideology. He said that ISIS 'is mostly staffed with foreign mujahedeen often not speaking any Arabic and little knowledge of Islam'.","ISIS media wing accused of using TV editing techniques for its terror videos .

"He makes no secret of his love of cannabis. He has even campaigned to legalise it. But it seems notorious gangster rapper Snoop Dogg mellowing towards more law-abiding forms of vegetation as he approaches middle age. The Drop It Like It's Hot star has posted a video on YouTube congratulating a retired farmer on his record-breaking swede - and invited him backstage at his upcoming gig in Cardiff in a bid to learn the secret. Scroll down for video . Paying homage: Snoop Dogg, wearing a Cardiff City shirt and standing in front a picture of Cannabis leaves, declares his respect for retired farmer Ian Neale and his massive swede in a YouTube clip (above and below) Ian Neale, 68, who smashed the Guinness World Record last month with his 85.5lb (6st) swede, was left stunned - but said he won't be taking up the offer because he is a country and western fan. The 34-second clip starts with Snoop, wearing a Cardiff City shirt and standing against a background of cannabis leaves, saying: 'What up? Shout out to my home boy Ian Neale in Cardiff for breaking the world record for the biggest vegetable. 'When I do my show in Cardiff, I want you to come backstage and see me because I do vegetation myself and I want to know your secret so I can show you my vegetables and see if you can grow that into a real big vegetable. 'Come see your boy Snoop Dogg, I've got two tickets for you when I get to town.' Record-breaker: Mr Neale, from Newport, South Wales, struggles to hold his mammoth swede, which weighed in at 85.5lbs (6st) Snub: Mr Neale has knocked back Snoop Dogg's invite to his Cardiff gig because he prefers country and western to rap . Mr Neale, from Newport, South Wales, said: 'It's very nice to be asked, but I'm more of a country and western man myself.' Snoop's appreciation of green-fingered pursuits is in contrast to his regular brushes with the law, which has seen him arrested a number of times for marijuana possession since he burst onto the scene with his second album Doggystyle in 1993. In 2006, he was banned from entering the UK following a brawl between his entourage and security at Heathrow Airport. The following year, the Home Office prevented him from obtaining a visa to enter the country over fears it could inspire crime among fans. Back in Britain: Snoop hosts a press conference to promote his new album Doggumentary at gentlemen's club Platinum Lace in London in May after his UK ban was lifted last year . But a judge ruled in 2008 that Snoop had not been at fault during the incident and the ban was fully overturned last year. In 2010, Snoop, real name Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, also released a video backing the effort to legalise marijuana in California. The American is due to play Cardiff's Motorpoint Arena on Saturday on a UK tour promoting his eleventh studio album, Doggumentary.",Rapper congratulates retired farmer on huge vegetable in YouTube clip .
"He is one of the Gaal-acticos now, a constellation of stars Manchester United’s manager must align to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford. But there have been times in the past eight months when Radamel Falcao feared he might never play at the highest level again. When Falcao, 28, ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a French Cup game in January, it soon became clear that the he would miss the Word Cup. VIDEO Scroll down for Radamel Falcao: I was in talks for months with Manchester United . Pointing the way: Colombia's Radamel Falcao is fit again after missing the World Cup through injury . Setback: Falcao ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament  playing in the French Cup for Monaco last January . Good feet: Colombia impressed at this summer's World Cup in Brazil despite the absence of Falcao . Colombia’s star striker could only watch as his country went out at the quarter-final stage to hosts Brazil in a bruising encounter in Fortaleza. It has not been an easy road to recovery. However, a week that began with him flying to Manchester on a private jet to tie up a deadline-day move to Louis van Gaal’s United ended with Falcao making his international comeback against the Brazilians in Miami on Friday. It was only for the last 13 minutes of a 1-0 defeat but this is Falcao after all. The man they call El Tigre. While his team-mates —Real Madrid’s new £71m signing James Rodriguez apart — warranted only passing interest from the waiting media, Falcao emerged from the dressing room at the Sun Life Stadium to an explosion of flashbulbs. El Tigre: Falcao came on for the final thirteen minutes of his country's 1-0 defeat to Brazil on Friday evening . Comeback: Falcao admitted he was nervous playing for his country again following his eight month lay-off . Plenty to smile about: Falcao says he is feeling spectacular and hopes to show he is still at the top level . ‘I’m so happy to be back and to have this opportunity life has granted me after the injury,’ he said. ‘I’m excited about being able to join Manchester United. I hope to score a lot of goals for them —that is something I have done everywhere I have played. ‘Because of the injury I felt so nervous before this game, almost like it was my first time with the national team. I expect it will be the same before I play my first game for United. All smiles: Falcao joined Man United from Monaco . ‘Physically I feel spectacular. I have been able to play without any kind of trouble whatever. Throughout my rehab people have given me so much support and sent me so many kind messages. I want to thank them by giving them as much happiness as possible. As time passes and I get into game shape, I believe I will show I’m still at the top level.’ Falcao’s injury made for a rigorous medical at United’s Carrington training centre on Monday night before his move was confirmed some considerable time after the transfer deadline had passed. Now he is determined to justify the massive expense they have gone to by bringing him to English football; more than £20million for one season if you factor in his £280,000-a-week ages on top of the £5m loan fee from Monaco. The transfer fee will be about £51.3m next summer should Van Gaal want to keep Falcao at United alongside Angel di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata. The former Porto and Atletico Madrid star knows what he is getting into. He understands his new club’s fall from grace and the fact that they have spent £150m this summer trying to put it right. ‘It is a dream come true to play for such a great and famous club,’ he said. ‘To bring the good times back is what we all want and I will work extra hard to do that. United are an historic club, one of the three best clubs in the world. They’ve made me feel very important in this new project and I’m very pleased and happy to have joined them. ‘There has been too much speculation about other clubs but that’s in the past now and I’ve chosen to join Manchester United. Going there was always in my best interests.’ Dream come true: Falcao chats with United's assistant manager shortly after joining the Red Devils . The striker was pictured celebrating with his agent Jorge Mendes and other advisors with a glass of wine in a city centre Chinese restaurant in the early hours of the morning before joining his Colombia team-mates in Miami, where he also applied for a visa at the British Consulate on Thursday. With everything that had gone on, coach Jose Pekerman chose to name Falcao on the bench after he had been out through an hour-long training session at the team hotel on Friday. It was probably a wise decision considering Colombia and Brazil wasted no time re-opening the hostilities that blighted their World Cup meeting. With Falcao hoping to make his United debut at home to QPR a week today, Van Gaal will be grateful he was kept out of the firing line for 77 minutes before replacing Rodriguez. New arrival: Falcao will be hoping to make his Manchester United debut against QPR a week on Sunday . Grateful: Man United manager Louis van Gaal will be pleased Falcao was used sparingly by Colombia . The build-up of excitement that started when he took his place on the bench before kick-off reached a crescendo when the No 9 went up on the board. A couple of final warm-up exercises in front of the dugout and Falcao was back. It all went a bit flat after that. Neymar claimed Brazil’s winner six minutes later and Falcao’s only notable contribution was to head a close-range chance over the bar. United fans will expect more for their money when Falcao lands in England today. El Tigre is desperate to deliver.","New Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao feared he might never play again at the highest level .

"Chris Froome maintained his slim hopes of claiming the Vuelta a Espana title despite missing out on victory on stage 18 atop Monte Castrove on Thursday. The conclusion of the 157-kilometre route from A Estrada featured two ascents of Monte Castrove and one of the final opportunities to accrue time. Italian Fabio Aru  beat Froome to the line, but the Team Sky leader stole crucial seconds from Alejandro Valverde  to move second behind overall leader Alberto Contador. Chris Froome finished second in stage 18 of Vuelta a Espana behind Astana's Italian cyclist Fabio Aru . Contador now leads Froome by one minute 19 seconds after the Spaniard finished fifth, 13 seconds behind Aru. Valverde fell to third, 13 seconds adrift of Froome and 1min 32 seconds behind Contador. It is unlikely Contador will relinquish the red jersey before Sunday's concluding short individual time-trial in Santiago de Compostela, but stranger things have happened. Friday's 180.5km 19th stage is from Salvaterra do Mino to Cangas do Morrazo. Luis Leon Sanchez was the last of the day's breakaway riders to be caught, with 15km remaining, ahead of the final finishing ascent. Tinkoff-Saxo's Alberto Contador is unlikely to surrender the lead at this stage of the Vuelta . Froome's Team Sky squad led the peloton and the 2013 Tour de France winner nicked a few bonus seconds at the intermediate sprint with 8km to go. The real action took place on the second climb to the finish, with Warren Barguil attacking. The Frenchman has been linked with a move to Team Sky in 2015. Barguil's move was short-lived as a select group caught him and the counter attacks continued, with Katusha attempting to help their leader Joaquin Rodriguez. Jerome Cappel then made his move before Aru , who began the day in fifth, accelerated. Chris Froome jumped Alejandro Valverde into second place overall, 1 minute 19 seconds behind Contador . Rodriguez followed, with Valverde, Contador and Froome chasing him. Froome then jumped towards Aru with 2.5km to go and Contador, Valverde and Rodriguez did not follow. Froome caught Aru, with the pair cresting the summit together before making a bid for the finish line. Aru was able to claim victory, but Froome's move saw him enhance his podium ambitions and keep his dream of a possible second Grand Tour title alive.

"PSG forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic has become Sweden's all-time record goal scorer. The 32-year-old netted a brace  in Sweden's friendly against Estonia to reach 50 international goals, overtaking Sven Rydell, who scored the last of his 49 goals against Finland in 1932. After breaking the record, Ibrahimovic took of his shirt to reveal a message for the fans. It read: 'Ni gjorde det mojligt,' or: 'You made it all possible.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch The Best of Zlatan! The funny, brilliant and bizarre . Record holder: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his 50th international goal for Sweden after a brace against Estonia . No 1: He has now broken Sven Rydel's record of 49 goals for Sweden, but in double the number of games . 1. Zlatan Ibrahimovic - 50 goals in 99 games . 2. Sven Rydell - 49 goals in 43 games . 3. Gunnar Nordhal - 43 goals in 33 games . 4. Henrik Larsson - 37 goals in 106 games . 5. Gunnar Gren - 32 goals in 57 games . 6. Kennet Andersson - 31 goals in 83 games . 7.

After making his international debut in 2001, Ibrahimovic scored his first goal for Sweden in his competitive debut - a 3-0 victory over Azerbaijan in a World Cup qualifier. Since then Sweden's enigmatic captain has gone on to score some of the most memorable goals in recent international history. At the 2004 European Championships the then-Ajax forward scored arguably the goal of the tournament. An acrobatic effort, the likes of which would become his trademark, found the net against Italy and helped engineer Ibrahimovic a move to Juventus. But his most memorable international goal came  in 2012. Having already put three past a lacklustre England side, Ibrahimovic scored a spectacular 35-yard bicycle kick to embarrass Joe Hart and earn himself the 2013 FIFA Puskas Award for the best goal of the year. Euro 2004: Zlatan Ibrahimovic scores an acrobatic effort against Italy, which earns him a move to Juventus .

Sweden's captain broke the record after scoring twice as his side beat Estonia 2-0 in a friendly in Solna. It was fitting that the 50th goal should be as brazen as the man himself. Seb Larsson broke down the right before cutting the ball back. The PSG front-man held off the defender before back-heeling the ball past goalkeeper Sergei Pareiko.

"The Democratic National Committee chairwoman has found herself in hot water after making controversial statements, comparing the Republican  governor of Wisconsin to an abuser. At a round-table discussion on women's issues in Milwaukee on Wednesday, Debbie Wasserman Schultz ridiculed Gov Scott Walker's gender policies, saying he gives 'women the back of his hand'. Walker is currently in the middle of heated re-election against Democratic candidate Mary Burke. It's unclear yet, whether these latest statements by Burke's party leader will impact the race significantly, in Walker's favor. Ouch: The Republican National Committee condemned DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Wednesday, after she made controversial statements comparing the Republican governor of Wisconsin for an abuser. Schultz pictured above at a press conference for Florida gubernatorial candidate Nan Rich on August 26 . Congresswoman Schultz was criticizing Scott's opposition to a minimum wage increase and support for a bill which would prevent people claiming employment discrimination from seeking damages in state court. 'Scott Walker has given women the back of his hand. I know that is stark. I know that is direct. I know that is reality,' Schultz said Wednesday. 'What Republican tea party extremists like Scott Walker are doing is they are grabbing us by the hair and pulling us back. It is not going to happen on our watch,' she added. The Republican National Committee pounced on Schultz comments, and issued a statement saying it was a 'new low for an already flailing Democratic Party'. 'This is a sad attempt to gain political points that’s offensive to victims of abuse and well beneath the chair of a major political party,' RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in a statement. Impact? Incumbent Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker (left)  is currently in the middle of a heated race with Democratic candidate Mary Burke (right) 'Mary Burke should denounce the leader of her party or explain why she’s standing by as Democrats mislead Wisconsin voters.' A spokesman for Burke did respond with a statement to FoxNews.com, saying it was not the kind of language the candidate herself would have used. The DNC also reacted, explaining that Schultz was in no way trying to belittle domestic violence. 'Domestic violence is an incredibly serious issue and the Congresswoman was by no means belittling the very real pain survivors experience,' DNC spokesman Lily Adams said. 'That's why Democrats have consistently supported the Violence Against Women Act and won’t take a lesson from the party that blocked and opposed its reauthorization. The fact of the matter is that Scott Walker’s policies have been bad for Wisconsin’s women.' Walker and Burke are running in one of the closest gubernatorial races this year, with both switching back and forth in the lead according to recent polls. A poll published in late August by Marquette University showed Burke up 2 percentage points, while an older poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports found Walker up a single point. Walked is also considered a potential Republican contender in the 2016 presidential election.","Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz made the controversial statements during a round-table discussion on Wednesday .

"Neil Adams was full of praise for striker Cameron Jerome after his brace sent Norwich top of The SkyBet Championship. Jerome - who made his first start of the season after his move from Stoke - scored two goals in the second half after Alex Tettey gave Norwich the lead against a spirited Brentford side. Norwich had John Ruddy to thank for keeping his side in the game and Tettey and Jerome made no mistake at the other end. Cameron Jerome scored a second-half brace to send Norwich top of the Championship table . Norwich manager Neil Adams has praised Jerome's second goal as being 'unsaveable' Brentford: Button 6; McCormack 6, Dean 6, Tarkowski 7, Bidwell 6.5; Douglas 6.5, Odubajo 6, Pritchard 6.5, Judge 6.5, Dallas 7 (Betinho 77); Gray 6 (Proschwitz 77) Subs not used: Bonham, Craig, Tebar, Jota, Toral . Booked: Tarkowski, Judge . Norwich City:- Ruddy 8, Whittaker 6, Turner 6, Hooiveld 6, Olsson 6; Tetty 7, Johnson 6; Jerome 8, Hoolahan 7 (Bennett 86), Redmond 7 (O’Neil 70); Grabban 6 (Odjidja-Ofoe 79) Subs not used: Rudd, Lafferty, Miquel, Murphy . Goals: Tettey 68, Jerome 75, 83 . Booked: Turner, Tettey . Attendance: 10,074 . Match Ratings from JAMES ANDREW at Griffin Park . Tettey finished off a good team move to lift the ball over David Button and then Jerome wrapped up the points with a diving header and an excellent strike from the edge of the area. Adams said: ‘Cameron scored two fabulous goals. The second was an excellent strike, it was unsaveable. ‘You have to start well in this division. You have to make sure you go about your business and we’ve been delighted with how we’ve started. ‘It is fantastic for us to be top of the league, it may only be for 24 hours, nothing is handed out in September, but I would rather than be there than not be.’ But Brentford boss Mark Warburton was raging at referee Tim Robinson not to award his side a penalty when Alex Prichard was brought down in the box by Jos Hooiveld. Norwich then broke away and scored their second and Warburton called it the turning point of the game. He said: ‘I thought should have had a penalty. I’m disappointed as it changed the entire course of game. If it’s not a penalty then book our player. That doesn't happen. That to me was a shocking decision which changed the game. ‘If I am the only one who thinks that is a penalty then I need to go to Specsavers.’ Adams said: ‘Your heart’s in your mouth when a player goes down in the box. I looked to the referee straight away. Luckily enough it wasn’t given. Our players didn’t think it was.’ Brentford's Jake Bidwell (R) gets away from Norwich midfielder Nathan Redmond (L) Brentford had been the better side up until the first goal and had three excellent chances to take the lead before the break. Moses Odubajo crossed for Andre Gray who turned brilliantly on the edge of the six yard box and fired just wide of Ruddy’s goal and Gray was then denied by the outstretched leg of Jos Hooiveld. And on the stroke of half time Ruddy pulled off a stunning one handed save to deny Alan McCormack’s 30 yard piledriver. Bradley Johnson had two good chances to give the visitors the lead at the start of the second half, but he fired his first shot over the bar after good work by Jerome. And then dragged his shot wide after a mazy run through the Brentford defence. Wes Hoolahan (R) sends Norwich off on another attack as the Canaries beat Brentford 3-0 at Griffin Park . Norwich defender Martin Olsson helps his side to a sixth consecutive victory from seven games this season . Ruddy was again forced into action as he tipped Alan Judge’s shot round the post just after the hour mark. But Norwich were able to keep them out and then Tettey put his side ahead shortly after the hour mark and then Jerome met Steven Whittaker's cross to head home at the far post before his spectacular second to earn Adams' side all three points. And Adams added: ‘We scored three goals which is probably a bit unfair. People will probably think Brentford have been battered. But they haven’t’","Norwich defeated Brentford 3-0 at Griffin Park to go top of Championship .

"Petr Cech's chances of squeezing out Thibaut Courtois suffered another blow on Thursday night when the new Chelsea No 1 signed a five-year contract. Chelsea have moved swiftly in negotiations with Belgium goalkeeper Courtois after he returned to Stamford Bridge following three years on loan with Atletico Madrid. His new contract, worth about £100,000 a week, confirms that his long-term future is at Chelsea working with Jose Mourinho. Courtois started the season ahead of Cech and there appears no way back into the team for the popular keeper. Cech was given permission to leave on transfer deadline day but he opted to stay at Chelsea. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho discuss Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois' rivalry .

Courtois, 22, played in Atletico Madrid’s La Liga-winning team last season and was in the side who lost to rivals Real Madrid in the Champions League final. He signed his new deal after returning from the international break and will face Swansea at Stamford Bridge on Friday. Courtois said: ‘I’m very happy with this deal, it’s nice to have signed this new contract for five years. My future was already sorted but it’s nice to know that I am going to be here for another five years. Now I can just concentrate on playing games.’ Courtois has conceded four goals in his opening three games since replacing Cech in goal, including three in the remarkable 6-3 win at Everton on August 30.

"The FA are considering bidding to host the European Championships in 2028, which would be the first campaign to stage a major football tournament since the 2018 World Cup vote fiasco. FA general secretary Alex Horne, who revealed the FA's ambition in Monaco on Thursday morning to dip their toes back in the murky bidding waters, has no fears that staging the climax to Euro 2020 would impact on England's chances. The final and semi-finals of Euro 2020 are heading for Wembley with England overwhelming favourites to be allocated the showcase tournament games by UEFA in Geneva on September 18. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Hodgson: Wayne Rooney as captain not guaranteed game . It's coming home: Wembley Stadium is set to host the final of Euro 2020, which will take place across Europe .

But Germany also have strong ambitions to host Euro 2024 and are still considering whether to pull out of 2020 final consideration in order to concentrate on their hosting blueprint for four years later leaving England in pole position. Horne said: 'We're really confident with our bid. We know what the Germans have been saying. We know that they're thinking about 2024, but nothing has been confirmed. 'I'm not going to dwell on their politics. I'm expecting that they're not going to push very hard for 2020. They've made it very clear they want 2024.' And Horne added: 'I wouldn't rule out looking at Euro 2028 for a full tournament bid.' German football chief Wolfgang Niersbach said: 'We still have the two options, to host the final rounds or four matches in the group stage. Our decision is open. We have a wonderful relationship with the England FA, but I am totally convinced that we will have both Wembley and Munich on the land map for Euro 2020.'

"QPR face a 194-mile coach journey back to West London after their game against Manchester United on Sunday, because they were unable to book out a train carriage for the return journey. The club travelled up by train for the Premier League clash, but couldn't get the space for the way home. And manager Harry Redknapp joked that it was because of too many Manchester United fans who live in London filling up the trains. Opposing supporters often mock Manchester United's fans with claims that they commute from London . Harry Redknapp said that his side were unable to book a train carriage for themselves for the way home . 'We couldn’t get a carriage to ourselves, there’s no room,' Redknapp told The Sun.

"The summer transfer window in England may be closed until the new year but there are still plenty of stars who are free to a good home. These unattached players can be picked up at any time and plenty of Premier League clubs will have their eyes on a bargain. Arsenal, for instance, still have room for two non-homegrown players to be added to their 25-man squad so Arsene Wenger may yet look to add to it, with experienced defender Mario Yepes potentially worth a punt. There are more than that, of course, and here are Sportsmail's best picks of the free agents... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Freestyling Ronaldinho loses his ball to a stickman . Free to a good home: Ronaldinho and Victor Valdes lead the potential free transfer signing . VIDEO Scroll down for The 10 most expensive Premier League summer 2014 transfers . Victor Valdes . Despite an injury plagued couple of years, Victor Valdes remains a top-class keeper. The Spaniard left Barcelona in the summer after 14 years, winning a host of trophies including six La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. The 32-year-old, who earlier in the summer failed a medical at Monaco due to a serious knee injury, is being strongly linked with a move to Liverpool and could end up there on a one-year deal. A possible spanner in the works is that he won't be fit until December. Shot stopper: Valdes established himself as one of the top keepers in the world during his time at Barcelona . Ronaldinho . Despite his advancing years, who wouldn't want to see the magical Brazilian in the Premier League for one last hurrah? The former Ballon d’Or winner is without a club since leaving Atletico Mineiro in July, and has been linked with a move to Benfica all summer as well as a host of other clubs from the newly-formed Indian Super League. The 34-year-old remains a free agent though and we all still hope to see those silky skills and that toothy smile in England's top flight before he does eventually call it a day. Silky: Ronaldinho, two-time world player of the year, still has plenty of skills in his locker . Mario Yepes . Yepes may be 38 now but he is showing no signs of slowing up just yet after playing every minute at the World Cup, where he captained Colombia to the quarter-finals. He predictably has a wealth of experience after spells with River Plate, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan but after leaving Serie A side Atalanta at the end of last season he is now a free agent and is reportedly keen on a move to England. With Arsenal a defender or two light, Wenger could do a lot worse than offer Yepes a short-term deal as he still seems more than capable of performing at the highest level. Experience: Mario Yepes could be an excellent addition to Arsene Wenger's squad for the long season ahead . Hugo Almeida . The former Portugal striker left Besiktas in the summer after three years in Istanbul, scoring 25 goals in the process. He has already attracted interest from newly-promoted Leicester this summer, as well as West Ham, Sunderland and Hull. Almeida, still only 30, could prove to be a useful addition to a mid-table Premier League side and comes with minimal risk too. Pedigree: Hugo Almeida is only 30 but he has amassed a lot of experience in the game at the highest level . Diego Lugano . The experienced Uruguay defender is without a club after leaving West Brom earlier this summer. The 33-year-old joined the club from PSG last summer, but the Baggies triggered a break clause to let him go halfway through his two-year contract. Lugano appeared for his country during the World Cup in Brazil so could prove to be a useful squad addition for a club battling against relegation. He has, however, been linked with a move to Serie A side Lazio. Determined: Lugano is looking to get his career back on track after an indifferent spell at West Brom . Jonas . The Brazilian striker terminated his contract at Valencia on Monday after three years with the club and the 30-year-old should now have a number of interested suitors. Jonas scored 10 goals in all competitions last season, including an eight minute hat-trick against Osasuna in the league. Capped 11 times by his country, Jonas still has plenty to offer at the highest level so it won't be to long before he gets a new club, with the Premier League potentially in sight for him. Quality: Jonas would be a very shrewd acquisition for a number of Premier League sides . Nilmar . The Brazil forward has been in the Middle East playing for the last two years but is now available on a free transfer after his Al-Jaish contract was cancelled by mutual consent earlier this summer. He was a star during his time at Villarreal alongside the likes of Santi Cazorla, proving he has what it takes to compete at the top. Nilmar also has a decent track record on the international stage netting nine times in his 23 appearances for his country. Could be worth a go. Reputable: Nilmar still has plenty to offer at the highest level . Anthony Reveillere . The experienced right back was with Napoli last season after joining on a free transfer in November. The 34-year-old spent 10 years in the all-conquering Lyon side (domestically, at least), and had spells at Valencia and Rennes. Despite his advancing years he could still do a job for a mid-table/lower Premier League side, with his five Ligue 1 title triumphs with Lyon proving he has the quality and mindset to succeed at the highest level. Top drawer: Anthony Reveillere has proved to be a very consistent player for club and country in his career . Florent Malouda . The experienced France winger knows the Premier League well following his time at Chelsea and was last with Trabzonspor. The 34-year-old spent six years at Stamford Bridge making more than 150 appearances and he finished on a high in the dramatic 2012 Champions League win over Bayern Munich. Leicester have reportedly been offered the wideman, who would bring versatility and experience to many a Premier League squad. French fancy: Florent Malouda could still do a job for most Premier League sides . Joseph Yobo . Despite a disappointing spell on loan at Norwich last season as the Canaries were relegated, Yobo has plenty of Premier League nous. The former Nigeria captain spent  nine years at Everton, featuring in over 200 Premier League matches, before moving to Turkish champions Fenerbahce in 2012. The 33-year-old is now available on a free transfer after departing Turkey in the summer and newly-promoted sides could do a lot worse. Rock at the back: Joseph Yobo was a fans' favourite during his time at Everton and still has plenty to offer . George McCartney . At 33 McCartney is by no means a long-term option but will bring much-needed experience and leadership  to any of the struggling sides. The left back spent five years at West Ham in two separate spells - he was released by the Hammers in the summer - and also captained Sunderland. Any Premier League club would have to move quickly, however, as the former Northern Ireland defender is in talks with Australian side Sydney FC. Experience: George McCartney has made around 200 Premier League appearances during his career . Matthew Etherington . Etherington is the kind of old-fashioned, chalk-on-his-boots winger who could provide attacking options for a few Premier League clubs, even at 33. He left Stoke at the end of last season but as of yet has failed to find a new club. After joining the Potters for £2million from West Ham in January 2009, Etherington became a firm fans favourite at the Britannia, making over 150 Premier League appearances during his five-year stint at the club, scoring in an FA Cup semi-final. Old-fashioned winger: Matthew Etherington likes nothing more than to beat a full back and put in a cross . Jermaine Pennant . Another player who has left Stoke this year, Pennant has plenty of baggage but also lots of ability. He has reportedly be seeing a sports psychologist in order to help get his attitude right and get his career back on track. Pennant was reportedly also set for a move to Italian outfit Napoli earlier this summer in a move which would have seen him link up with his former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez, under whom he flourised and played in a Champions League final, but that failed to materialise. Ability: Jermaine Pennant is still more than capable of playing in England's top flight . Tomasz Kuszczak: . Kuszczak was an ever-present for Brighton before being released at the end of last season. The former Manchester United stopper performed admirably down at the Amex as the Seagulls reached the Championship play-offs in successive years. The 32-year-old would be a good No 2 for many clubs in the Premier League. Highly rated: Tomasz Kuszczak is keen on a move to the Premier League after leaving Brighton . Park Chu-Young . Park never started a league game during his three years at Arsenal but, seeing as he is still only 29 the South Korea forward would be open to the idea of another chance to impress in the Premier League. A newly-promoted side may take a punt on the former Celta Vigo and Watford loanee, who does have a decent goalscoring record at international level - with 24 goals in 65 appearances. Talented: Park failed to impress at Arsenal but may want another opportunity to impress in the Premier League . The following are also still available... Abdoulaye Faye, Robert Earnshaw, Mikele Leigertwood, David Prutton, Anthony Gardner, Adam Drury, Sean St Ledger, Luke Young, Zat Knight, Peter Lovenkrands, Chris Eagles & Craig Fagan.

"Immigration dockets are so backlogged, a Virginia judge is setting court dates for illegal children for four years from now. CNS News reports that Arlington, Virginia, Judge John M. Bryant told at least three minors appearing before his court on Tuesday morning that their next hearing would be June 11, 2018. 'Are you available that day?' Bryant reportedly asked one of the immigrant's lawyers as a joke. Immigration courts are so backlogged that they are scheduling hearings for newly arrived illegal immigrant children for up to four years from now . 'I don’t have my 2018 calendar in front of me, but yes, I believe so,' the lawyer told him. 'Okay, good. Have a good school year,' Bryant told the minor, a 17-year-old boy named Christian. 'I’ll see you in a few years, okay?' With 375,000 immigration cases stuck on judges' dockets, illegal immigrants of all ages are routinely made to wait years for a full hearing. The average processing time for a case now stands at 520 days, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. The Justice Department recently instituted a policy requiring courts to give children immigrants their initial hearing within three weeks of their arrival in the U.S. in an effort to try to get the process moving more quickly. But the deluge of immigrant children entering the country illegally with or without a guardian still has courts tied in knots. In the case of the Virginia court observed by CNS News, the judge was spent just four minutes a piece on each minor and was still only able to make it through 35 cases that morning. A reporter for The Heritage Foundation's The Daily Signal who observed the same courtroom in mid-August said the judge made it through 38 names the day he was there. By comparison, roughly 250 unaccompanied minors were illegally entering the country each day at the beginning of this summer. The U.S. predicts that by the end of this month, as many as 90,000 immigrant children, many of whom are from Central America, will have arrived since last year. According to data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the court system has just 243 immigration judges at present. President Barack Obama has requested emergency funds from Congress to pay for more immigration judges and other immigration-related expenses, but the House and the Senate were unable to come to an agreement on how much money to appropriate to the problem before they left for the summer break. Lawmakers will return to Washington, D.C. next week, however they will have just 12 work days to hash out their differences on the immigration spending bill and a host of other issues before closing up shop again until after November's elections. Immigrant children are sent to public school while they away their hearing dates. Educating illegal immigrant children will cost an estimated $761 million this year . Judges could make the immigration process go faster by issuing deportation notices to illegal children who don't show up for their initial hearings, but they often don't given how little warning minors are now given before their court dates. 'It's just not efficient to go so fast that challenges can be made to the due process,' immigration judge Dana Leigh Marks told the Associated Press at the end of July. 'It ends up making the cases take longer overall and results in longer appeals, so no one is happy,' she said. Furthermore, government officials are prohibited from deporting illegal children as soon as they enter the country unless they are from Canada or Mexico. House Republicans passed legislation last month that would amend the law to allow Central American children to be immediately sent home. There's little to no chance that the Democratic-led Senate will take up the measure, though. Without additional funding from Congress or a change in the law, immigration courts could continue to be jam-packed for years. In the meantime, illegal immigrant children are released back to their parents or guardians and sent off to school at the expense of the school district's taxpayers. The Federation for American Immigration Reform estimates that 37,000 unaccompanied minors enrolled in school this fall and will cost schools $761 million this year to educate. Residents of New York, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, California and New Jersey will pay the biggest price, FAIR says. Those seven states will be on the hook for more than $50 million a piece this year to educate illegal immigration children. New York alone will be responsible for $147.7 million of the total amount. Educators are unable to turn away students simply because they know or suspect they are illegal immigrants. The Supreme Court has ruled that public schools cannot require children to provide proof of citizenship in order to enroll. In May the Departments of Justice and Education sent a joint memo to teachers reminding them of the rules as Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department would do 'everything it can' to make sure students of all origins are receiving equal protection under the law. Soon after, schools began publicly complaining about the crippling costs associated with educating illegal children. One Massachusetts town said double the number of foreign born students have enrolled in its educational system throughout the last two years than did before. This school year the town's educational system took on more than 600 new foreign students, 248 of whom were from Guatemala, it's mayor, Judith Flanagan Kennedy, said. Roughly half of the Guatemalan children who enrolled in the Lynn, Massachusetts school district,126, are known to be illegal immigrants, Kennedy told Fox 25. Kennedy noted that 'it's gotten to the point where the school system is overwhelmed, our health department is overwhelmed, the city's budget is being sustainably altered in order of accommodate all of these admissions in the school department.' The school district's superintendent told Fox 25 that the influx of students has created overcrowding, and the district is having to spend it's limited financial resources on hiring more teachers and paying for the necessary vaccinations for newly enrolled students. 'The way this is going, Lynn looks like a microcosm of the United States, in that we have been filled to capacity and we can't take anymore without having the people who are already here suffer,' Kennedy said.","U.S. law prohibits the government from sending children from non-contiguous states back to their home countries without due process .

"Liverpool will lay down the law to Mario Balotelli over what they expect from him as he closes in on a £16million move to Anfield. Brendan Rodgers’ summer-long search for a top-class striker has led him to Balotelli, the Italy forward who he said two weeks ago would ‘categorically not be at Liverpool’. However, an about-turn by Rodgers has seen Liverpool agree a deal with AC Milan to sign Balotelli. They initially enquired about taking him for a season but were quoted an exorbitant loan fee. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the biggest, badest and best moments of Mario Balotelli . Anfield bound: Liverpool think flamboyant Italian striker Mario Balotelli is good value at £16million . How it's going to be: Balotelli mocked up in a Liverpool shirt in anticipation of his move to Anfield . Drive to succeed: Balotelli leaves Milan's training ground in his red Ferrari . Super Mario: Balotelli left the Premier League in 2013, but now seems to be on his way back with Liverpool . Change of heart: Rodgers had previously said he would not be signing the Italian striker . Stats: Balotelli's Premier League record (via Opta) Liverpool believe the 24-year-old is value for money at £16m, given some of the prices quoted for other strikers who have moved during this window, and have offered him a deal worth £90,000 a week. Nevertheless, Liverpool officials met Balotelli’s representatives in a city centre hotel on Thursday night and made it clear that they would expect absolute commitment from the former Manchester City Milan forward, on and off the field. Balotelli’s career has been littered with bizarre episodes, such as setting off fireworks in his bathroom, and they want guarantees from him there will be no more erratic behaviour. If Balotelli is not willing to accept, Liverpool would walk away and look at other targets, headed by Samuel Eto’o. This move, though, comes after Liverpool have done significant research into his character and Rodgers believes Balotelli has the tools to help his side develop in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League. More significantly, it is felt he will thrive in the environment at Liverpool’s Melwood training base, where Rodgers has built a tightly knit group that is strong enough to cope with the arrival of such a larger-than-life figure. Some will wonder why, after selling Luis Suarez, Liverpool are prepared to take another gamble but Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher feels Rodgers’ man-management would help Balotelli. ‘The main thing for any player is what he does on the pitch,’ said Carragher. ‘Both players had issues off the pitch, but I think it’s fair to say Suarez did a lot more on the pitch. Would Balotelli be the final piece of the jigsaw? Would he make the starting XI if everyone was fit and firing? Who knows?’ Striker: Balotelli scored 30 goals in 80 games for City before moving back to Italy . Flashpoint: Balotelli had a number of run-ins during his explosive relationship with Roberto Mancini . Although Balotelli was a controversial figure off the field at City, he was a relative success on it during his three years at the club between 2010 and 2013. After his £24m move from Inter Milan he helped City win their first Premier League title, won the FA Cup and Community Shield and scored 30 goals in 50 starts. Having invested £101m to give their squad depth during this window, Liverpool have been the Premier League’s biggest spenders but the one problem area for Rodgers was finding a top-class front man to work alongside — and provide competition for — Daniel Sturridge. They initially had a deal in place for Loic Remy of Queens Park Rangers but called it off at the 11th hour because of a discrepancy with his medical. Liverpool then turned to Monaco’s Radamel Falcao, whom they would have paid £12million to take for a season. Falcao never gave any encouragement, which then led them to Eto’o and finally Balotelli. Should talks continue to run as smoothly as they have done, there is potential for the deal to be completed at some point during the weekend. The move would leave Milan in the market for a new striker and may cause a domino effect that could see Tottenham misfit Roberto Soldado head for the San Siro, to be replaced at White Hart Lane by Remy. Soldado has not been a success since his £26m move from Valencia last summer, Thursday night’s goal against Limassol notwithstanding. He is set to continue under new manager Mauricio Pochettino as understudy to Emmanuel Adebayor in a system with only one central striker. Spurs are keen to move for unsettled France striker Remy, but they have such a large squad that they do not want to bloat it further without moving players out. Couple: The Italian striker and his partner Fanny Neguesha in Miami over the summer . Sending a message: Balotelli with his famous 'Why Always Me?' T-shirt at Old Trafford in 2011 . Vlad Chiriches is another who is available and Roma are interested if they sell centre-half Mehdi Benatia, who is closing in on a move to Bayern Munich after rejecting Manchester United. Roma officials have been in England this week. They like Chiriches and have a familiar route of negotiation through Tottenham’s technical director Franco Baldini, but are also looking at Manchester City’s Matija Nastasic. Pochettino has been chasing Villarreal defender Mateo Musacchio but have hit a snag unravelling the Argentine’s complicated ownership history, and are also considering Sevilla’s Federico Fazio, another Argentine.

"The cost of converting the Olympic Stadium for use by West Ham could rise by £15 million due to problems involving the construction of a new roof. According to Sky Sports News, the total cost of the stadium could reach £600 million - twice the original cost in London's 2012 bid, once a new roof and retractable seating to cover the running track have been installed. The original stadium was not intended to be used as a Premier League ground and initially cost £429 million with the conversion expected to involve a further £154 million before complications arose. Grounds for complaint: The Olympic Stadium could cost an additional £15m to convert into West Ham's home . The London Legacy Development Corporation is confident that the increase will be covered by savings elsewhere and is intending to hold contractors Balfour Beatty to its fixed-price contract. In a statement the LLDC said: 'The Legacy Corporation and its contractors are working closely together to convert the Stadium from its Games-time mode into a multi-use, year round venue. 'It is a highly complex scheme and subject to tight project management to ensure that all the risks and issues are properly managed, as would be expected on a fixed price contract and an undertaking of this scope and scale.' House warming: West Ham are expected to move into the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 season . The potential cost increase has been raised to allow the stadium structure to be strengthen to support he weight of the new roof. West Ham won the bid to be anchor tenants after a bitter dispute with London neighbours Tottenham. The stadium was expected to be re-opened for a Diamond athletics meeting next summer and five Rugby World Cup matches in the autumn, before West Ham move in for the 2016-17 season.

"Fernando Torres has officially begun life as an AC Milan player, pictured in his first training session for the Italian giants. Torres, who has joined Milan on a two-year loan deal from parent club Chelsea, seemed to be fitting into his new surroundings on Wednesday as he took to the field with his new team-mates for the first time. The Spanish striker, who has made 110 league appearances for Chelsea since joining the west London club for £50 million in January 2011, has fallen out of favour with Blues boss Jose Mourinho and was shipped out on loan last week for the remaining two years of his contract.

"A Russian tycoon has become the victim of a cement bucket challenge after his gleaming £165,000 Bentley received a dousing when he parked too close to a construction site. Artur Shachnev parked his prized Bentley too close to a Moscow building site when workers from a height of 50 feet accidentally spilt seven tonnes of wet cement, which then dried on the car. By the time he noticed, the Bentley was concreted over and very seriously damaged. A Russian tycoon has become the victim of a cement bucket challenge after his £165,000 Bentley received a dousing when he parked too close to a construction site . Artur Shachnev parked his Bentley too close to a Moscow building site when workers accidentally spilt seven tonnes of wet cement, which then dried on the car . Mr Shachnev tried his best to laugh off the damage caused to his car. He posted on Facebook: 'Today my close friend, which died suddenly under some tonnes of construction cement, left me' The 32-year-old did his best to laugh off the nightmare to his Bentley, which he nicknames Bantik. He posted on Facebook: 'Today my close friend, which died suddenly under some tonnes of construction cement, left me. 'Rest in peace, my dear Bantik, under concrete.' The car's headlights and boot were damaged too, as were his expensive suits which were inside the vehicle . He has passed the problem to his insurance company which has so far not commented. Mr Shachnev, the CEO of a music production company, challenged Russia's political clown, ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, to take the cement bucket challenge in his wake. By the time Mr Shachnev had noticed what had happened, the Bentley was concreted over and very seriously damaged . As pictures of his car were shared on Russian websites, Shachnev spoke of 'my famous concreted Bentley'. 'I hope to get into the Guinness Record Book, because 7 tonnes of cement from a height of 15 meters is not a bucket of ice,' he said. 'If I don't get the proposal to compensate me for the damage from the representatives of the developer, I will go to the court,' he vowed. The car owner said he had been contacted by the deputy general director of the construction company at the site of the disaster, which is owned by the Institute of World Civilisations. Mr Schachnev has now passed the incident on to his insurance company to assess the damage . The company had promised to compensate him for all losses, but had yet to make a specific proposal, he said. 'It's impossible to clean the concrete off the entire body of the car,' he said. 'It needs to be changed. A new body would cost twice the price of my car, which I've been using for three years.'","Artur Shachnev had parked his Bentley too close to a Moscow building site when workers accidentally spilt seven tonnes of wet cement on to the car .

"American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, whose name was Peter before converting to Islam, was captured by ISIS militants October 1, 2013 while doing humanitarian work in eastern Syria . The parents of American ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig have appealed directly to the terror group leader on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life. Ed and Paula Kassig, of Indianapolis, Indiana, reached out to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi over social media this week. Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, whose name was Peter before converting to Islam, was captured by ISIS militants on October 1, 2013 while doing humanitarian work in eastern Syria, CNN reported. Following the beheading of British hostage Alan Henning in a video released last Friday, Mr Kassig was named by ISIS as their next beheading victim. Just one day after the threat to kill the American aid worker was released, the Kassigs posted a video on YouTube reaching out to the terrorists. They had learned about his abduction and interest in Islam last October from his former colleagues but maintained a one-year silence while they waited for news. On Wednesday, the hostage's family posted a message to Twitter pleading to the ISIS leader directly. The letter read: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child. 'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?' In a video published to YouTube on October 4, the Kassigs sat on a couch and spoke about the 26-year-old's humanitarian work during a desperate plea for his life. 'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people,' Mrs Kassig said in the video as she clutched a photo of her son to her chest. 'Please know that we are all praying for you and your safe return.' Scroll down for video . Ed and Paula Kassig posted a desperate message on YouTube pleading for mercy to the Islamic extremists . On Wednesday, the hostage's mother, Paula Kassig, posted a message to Twitter pleading directly to the ISIS leader for her son's life . She continued: 'Most of all, know that we love you and our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, a life of service to those in greatest need. 'We implore those who are holding you to show mercy and use their power to let you go.' Abdul-Rahman Kassig wrote in a letter to his parents, which they received on June 2, that he was 'scared to die' and saddened by the pain the ordeal has caused his family, BBC News reported. June 2006: Joined the Army . October 2006: Assigned to the Army's 75th Ranger Regiment . April-July 2007: Deployed to Iraq . September 2007: Honorably discharged as a private first class due to an unspecified medical condition . Between 2008 and 2010: Married and divorced, reports claim . Spring 2011-2012: Majored in political science at Butler University, Indiana. Graduated as a certified emergency medical technician . 2012: Founded humanitarian aid group SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) based in Gaziantep, Turkey . January 8, 2013: Moved to Beirut, Lebanon, working for SERA . July-August 2013: Observed Ramadan fast with Muslim colleagues . October 1, 2013: Kidnapped in Deir Ezzour, eastern Syria . Between October and December 2013: Converted in Islam while sharing a cell with a devout Muslim. His parents say his journey toward Islam started before captivity; insist he was not forced into conversion . June 2, 2013: Abdul-Rahman Kassig wrote to his parents. He explained his situation was 'dogmatically complicated', which they believe referred to his conversion. He said he prays five times a day . The hostage wrote: 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.' He continued: 'If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.' The hostage told his parents that he prayed every day and was not angry about his situation 'in terms of my faith'. The letter ended with the words: 'I love you.' The 26-year-old started his 'journey toward Islam' in 2013 while living and working with Syrian Muslims for his own humanitarian aid company in Beirut, they said. According to a statement tweeted by Ed and Paula Kassig on Sunday, their son observed a month-long Ramadan fast between July and August 2013, which had a 'great impact on him'. But it was not until after he was captured by ISIS in eastern Syria on October 1, 2013 that he made his conversion to the faith while sharing a cell with a devout Muslim. Now going by the name Abdul-Rahman - which means 'slave of the merciful' in Arabic - the former U.S. Army private prays five times a day. Nearly 300 people gathered at Butler University in Indianapolis to celebrate Kassig's humanitarian work and pray for his release. Mr Kassig was a student at the university from 2011 to 2012. Todd Hill, one of Mr Kassig's former classmates, praised the 26-year-old for his strength of character. 'He fully understood that this was a possibility and he accepted that, and I think that says a tremendous amount about the sort of person he is and to the kind of legacy he wants to create,' Mr Hill said. Mr Kassig first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier in April 2007 when he was deployed to Iraq with the 75th Ranger Regiment. He returned to Indianapolis in June 2007, and was honorably discharged as a first class private in September of that year due to an unspecified medical condition. In the next two years, he reportedly got married and then divorced before enrolling as a political science major at Butler University, Indiana, in 2011. In a video released last Friday, Islamic State militants threatened to kill American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig . The Kassigs created a Twitter profile and tweeted a photo of a letter to the jihadist leader numerous times on Wednesday pleading for the life of their only son . Peter Kassig, pictured with his father Ed. The humanitarian aid worker is being held hostage by ISIS and was threatened as their next beheading victim last week . He graduated in 2012 after taking a spring break holiday in Beirut. His trip inspired him to return later that year and set up his own humanitarian aid company, SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance). The medically-oriented emergency relief group served refugee populations and internally displaced persons from Gaziantep, Turkey. As of January 2013, he was based in Beirut, Lebanon, and traveled often to Gaziantep and parts of Syria. Between July and August 2013, he observed Ramadan. It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, when he was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria.

Mr Livni told Israel Radio News: 'The decision was incorrect. It was a decision that weakens Israel and damages its security.'

"A young mother is asking the Maine Supreme Judicial court to overturn a state-imposed do-not-resuscitate order for her baby daughter, who, in a medical miracle, came out of a coma after she was placed in her mother's arms to die. The one-year-old, Aleah Peaslee, is brain-damaged and blind after her 22-year-old father Kevin Peaslee allegedly violently shook her on December 21 in an apartment he shared with her 17-year-old mother Virginia Trask. The baby was placed under state custody because of the alleged child abuse, but Trask's parental rights have not been terminated, and she's fighting the state's imposition of a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order on the girl. The child went into a 'deep coma' after the alleged shaking incident and doctors informed the mother that she was 'neurologically devastated,' reports Fox News. Trask agreed to the DNR order after being informed of her daughter's grave condition. However, after Aleah was removed from a ventilator and put into her mother's arms to die, she began breathing on her own and opened her eyes. She eventually became alert and the parents canceled the DNR order. However, medical personnel wanted to reinstate the order because the baby girl's still-grave condition. The Maine Department of Health and Human Services then obtained authority to do so, without terminating the mother's parental rights. The judge said that it was in Aleah's 'best interest' not to 'endure a cascading series of events that would inevitably lead to her death.' The Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys and several other groups have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Trask, saying that state officials do not have the constitutional right to make the choice for Trask's child. Right to life: Aleah Peaslee's mother wants to overturn a state-imposed do-not-resuscitate order for the baby . 'Even when a state agency believes the parent’s decision to be incorrect, that does not permit it to interfere in the parent’s right to make medical decisions for her child,' the brief reads. 'The state is effectively arguing that this mom isn’t fit to make medical decisions for her child simply because she wants the child to live. No one has declared this mother an unfit parent, yet the government wants to take her place,' ADF Senior Counsel Steven H. Aden told WND. 'The Maine Supreme Judicial Court should reaffirm Mainers’ interest in life, parental rights, and the integrity of the medical profession by reversing the lower court and restoring this mom’s full rights to make medical decisions on her daughter’s behalf.' According to WND, Kevin Peaslee ran a stop sign with Aleah in the car and was pulled over by police. They noticed the child needed medical help and drove the father and daughter to hospital. Peaslee was bailed out of jail in January after pleading not guilty to felony assault and felony aggravated assault. 'Everyone deserves a fighting chance to live. All this mother is doing is fighting for that chance for her baby,' said ADF Senior Counsel Steven H. Aden. 'This mother’s parental rights should not be ignored; no one has the authority to deny her the right to save her daughter’s life.'","Virginia Trask, 17, is seeking to overturn a state-imposed do-not-resuscitate order for her one-year-old daughter Aleah Peaslee .

"The magnificent summer home of Egyptologist Lord Carnarvon, with 40 rooms, 31,000 square metres of parkland and magnificent views of the Italian Riviera, is going up for sale. However, with an asking price of 34 million euros, potential buyers of Villa Altachiara will need deep pockets. They will also need to be fairly fearless, because it's said to be jinxed by the Curse of Tutankhamun, after Lord Carnarvon uncovered the pharaoh's tomb. Scroll down for video . The magnificent summer home of Egyptologist Lord Carnarvon, with 40 rooms, 31,000 square metres of parkland and magnificent views of the Italian Riviera, is going up for sale - but it's said to be jinxed . The 140-year-old villa, which goes under the hammer in November in Genoa, was eventually sold by the Carnarvons to the Agusta family of helicopter magnates . Rooms with a view: The villa nestles in a prime spot on the Italian Riviera . The imposing 19th century mansion built on a clifftop overlooking the chic seaside town of Portofino, was built by the fourth Lord Carnarvon, Henry, as his summer retreat. His main home was Highclere Castle, famed for being used as the location of Downton Abbey. 'Alta Chiara ' is Italian translation of the name of 'Highclere,' His son, the fifth Lord Carnarvon, George, who inherited the villa, had been left with a permanent limp and badly injured lungs after an accident in his racing car. Luxury: The swimming pool at Villa Altachiara . High spec: The villa may have a curse, but's also extremely comfortable . Expensive: The villa has an asking price of 34 million euros . Advised by doctors to recover in a warm climate he took up the-then fashionable Egyptology. Working with famed English archaeologist Howard Carter, the two men made the extraordinary discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, the richest burial site ever found. But soon after discovering the tomb of the boy pharoah in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, Lord Carnavon died from an infected mosquito bite in Cairo's Savoy Continental Hotel. This unexpected death, so soon after the tomb had been opened, gave way to the myth that he was cursed by the young pharaoh for disturbing his eternal peace. The legend was perpetuated when his nephew died months later, after falling down a flight of steps at the villa. The 140-year-old villa, which goes under the hammer in November in Genoa, was eventually sold by the Carnarvons to the Agusta family of helicopter magnates. It features a pool, a helicopter pad and 30 rooms. Then in 2001 another unexplained death followed when former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta, disappeared from the clip-top villa.

"CLICK HERE for your ultimate stats guide to the game, including pitch maps of both of Graziano Pelle's goals. What a terrible afternoon to be Newcastle manager Alan Pardew. His flailing side were derided by their own supporters, who had made a 660-mile round-trip, were 2-0 down within 20 minutes and flattered by the final scoreline. Newcastle are yet to win after their four Barclays Premier League games and host Hull next weekend, the first time Pardew will have faced the club since he butted David Meyler on the touchline and was given a seven-match ban by the Football Association and a £100,000 fine by his club. There were calls for him to be sacked then. A defeat next weekend and Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is not likely to be so lenient.

From the opening minute at St Mary’s it was an onslaught. Just 24 seconds in, a terrible back-pass to goalkeeper Tim Krul allowed Shane Long to charge down his clearance. The ball fell inches wide of the right post. Three minutes later Southampton should have had a penalty when Long raced on to a ball over the top, headed it around Krul only to be clattered by the goalkeeper inside the box. Referee Chris Foy gave nothing. But six minutes of sustained pressure straight from the kick-off resulted in the opening goal. Ryan Bertrand crossed for Graziano Pelle who was left free to head in from five yards out. At that point chants of ‘We want Pardew out’ and ‘Alan Pardew, it’s never your fault’ began from theNewcastle fans. After Southampton made it 2-0 in the 19th minute, the chants got worse. Pardew blamed that poor start for the result. ‘The early goals put us on the back foot,’ he said. ‘We made individual mistakes that we couldn’t absorb. We have to take that as a team. ‘We had a great chance at 2-0 and half a chance after that. We have played OK at the start of the season and really got caught out. ‘We didn’t have long to prepare after the internationals but there’s no excuse really. The players tried everything at 2-0. We just got caught at the start.’ The manner of the second goal did not help tempers. Southampton were hosting their annual Carnival Day, but they did not expect to welcome a Newcastle back line who defended like clowns. Long played a long diagonal ball from his own half and Michael Williamson headed straight to Pelle. Krul was off his line and Pelle shot first time, but his volley skewed to Dusan Tadic. He ran into the box and passed back to Pelle to tap in his fourth goal in three games. The ‘We want Pardew out’ cries became even more feverish and when Southampton fans started up a chant of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ it was taken over and carried on in the away end. Pardew remained sitting in the dugout, unmoved. He was still there, hunched forward with his elbows on his knees, when more calamitous defending from his side allowed Southampton to score a third in the 54th minute.

Struggling Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew (second left) sits and gives directions above a 'Sky Bet Football League' advert during the match at St Mary's Stadium . The Italian striker scored 50 goals in two seasons at Dutch side Feyenoord before joining Southampton this summer. Pelle, 29, spent his teen years at Lecce, from where he was sent out on loan three times in two years, before signing for AZ Alkmaar, where he scored 14 times in 78 appearances. He moved to Parma in 2011 but played only 12 games, scoring just once, before going on loan to Sampdoria and then Feyenoord. Since his arrival at Southampton, he has scored three goals in four games and looks good for many more. Steven Davis played a through-ball from deep, Williamson let it run for Krul, only for Jack Cork to steal in, round the goalkeeper and score. It was Cork’s first league goal for Southampton in three years at the club — League One defences had never allowed him that privilege. Those Newcastle chants started up again. And there was no letting up from Southampton, who made it four in stoppage time when Morgan Schneiderlin curled the ball into the top right corner. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman had little sympathy for his counterpart. Asked about the chants, he replied: ‘It’s always difficult, it’s part of our job. ‘You have to concentrate every day and focus every day. It’s football, it’s going fast. If it goes badly, you have to wait to win again. If you don’t like it you have to do something different.’ There were flashes, however brief, from the away side. Moussa Sissoko hit a first-time shot straight at Fraser Forster in the first half and Jack Colback, stretching, missed an open goal from two yards out in the second. That just about summed up their afternoon. Unless results pick up, Pardew’s four-year tenure at the club is coming to its end.

"Lying on a plastic, avocado-green couch in a basement room in London’s Covent Garden, I take a couple of deep, steadying breaths. At 46, I’m doing what I swore I never would. I’m getting a tattoo — and I’m absolutely petrified. Worse still, it’s on my face. It might sound drastic, but I’m desperate: my eyebrows have never looked thinner or weedier. I’m taking the bold step of getting a new pair tattooed on and I’m beginning to question my sanity. Scroll down for video . Frances was sick of her eyebrows which were becoming more uneven with age so she resorted to tattooing hers on using a new treatment from Browhaus . The problem is I’m sick of looking in the mirror and seeing anaemic brows that fade into the background, making my face appear sallow and aged. Plus, ‘statement’ brows have never been more popular. Everyone from Cara Delevingne to the Duchess of Cambridge has beautifully tended, bold eyebrows — and their cache is sky-high. Mine, very definitely, are letting me down. I started plucking them in my teens, but on hitting 40, I realised I might need a little more help and resorted to waxing and threading. Lately, as little bald patches have developed, I’ve felt that even the professionals have struggled to get a decent shape. What’s more, a slight asymmetry between my brows — my left one is lower than my right — has become more pronounced, pulling my face downwards and emphasising the droopiness around my eyes. Things came to a head when my friend Jackie brought me a brow grooming kit for my birthday. ‘We all need a bit of help as we get older,’ she said with a half-laugh. Elsa goes under the needle in her quest for perfectly aligned brows . So I’m hoping a new treatment by Browhaus can help. Unlike other tattoo techniques it uses a thin needle, which — crucially — doesn’t vibrate. This allows far greater precision: weaving in and meshing the flicks of dye with your own hair. Browhaus has also developed a system to measure the brow and perfectly align it to your face. The result is supposedly an on-point brow that even mathematicians couldn’t better. It could be just what I need. Celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor agrees my brows are ageing. ‘Having very thin eyebrows looks terribly old-fashioned and adds years to your face,’ she says. ‘A good, strong brow frames the face and gives structure and definition.’ As we age, asymmetry becomes more pronounced. This, says Oonagh, is a dead giveaway of middle age. Priya Kerai, senior technician at Browhaus, adds: ‘As we get older, we lose hair from our brows. We also lose colour and definition.’ Browhaus, as the name suggests, specialises in all things eyebrow-related. It has only one salon in Britain — in London — with others worldwide. I am hoping it can find a solution to my wonky brows, so I book a full brow makeover, for £550. After a half-hour consultation, Priya tells me my main problem is asymmetry. ‘Having asymmetrical brows isn’t uncommon. It’s because we use one side of our face more than the other,’ she says. ‘You’ve spent more than 40 years raising your right brow more than the left.’ She suggests raising my left arch slightly and elongating my brows, plus slightly darkening them. Unlike other brow bars, Browhaus uses a small hand-held tool to paint on each individual hair. ‘Normally, if you get your brows tattooed on, the therapist will use an electronic tool and will paint on the brow in a thick block,’ says Priya. Her technique is far more exact. The first step is for Priya to create a shape to compliment my face. She does this with a brow shaver — a tiny blade inserted in a little pen. Some reports show that never-plucked brows can have as many as 1,100 hairs in total . I can’t see what she’s doing, but I can feel a thin scrape and it’s disconcerting. She is creating a softer arch and removing excess hair. She doesn’t pluck because that would open up my pores, and she doesn’t want colour to leak in. Despite Priya’s calm exterior and her rather lovely brows, I’m terrified. Suppose I end up looking like Groucho Marx or Coleen Rooney? It’s also crucial Priya gets it right, since it lasts for two years. Thankfully, she draws on my brows with a pencil and only proceeds to the real thing when I’m happy. When Priya holds up the mirror, my brows are thick, dark and unnatural — like two caterpillars. There’s no way I want to look like that for two years. ‘I don’t like it. It needs to be much subtler,’ I say. Priya takes it like a trouper and sets to work again. Second time around I’m much happier. Priya has evened out the asymmetry, and the effect is youthful and groomed. Then I remember what comes next, and feel the sort of terror I’ve only felt once before, when I was about to have a forceps delivery. Back then, I knew I was going to have a beautiful baby at the end of it. This time I’m hoping for a beautiful pair of eyebrows. I wonder if I’m having a mid-life crisis. The needle is tiny and, thanks to a numbing cream, I feel only a faint pricking. Threading is more painful. Priya dips the needle into a vegetable-based dye then works her way across each brow, painting in hair where I’ve lost it. One of the key signs of ageing is a shorter eyebrow, so Priya elongates mine — edging out subtly towards my temples. The needle penetrates to the second layer of skin — traditional tattooing reaches the third. I’m assured the colour will fade, meshing with my natural tint. I won’t be wandering around with obvious regrowth. There are seven colours to choose from. I’ve gone for ash blonde. The golden rule is to go one shade darker than your natural colour. Twenty terrifying minutes later, I’m done. I can hardly bear to look in the mirror, but when I do I’m delighted. I really do look younger. Best of all, Priya has worked wonders on my drooping left brow. It’s still slightly lower than my right, but now my brows are better aligned, my face is lifted. In fact, when I meet my friend Mandy for lunch, she asks whether I’ve had Botox. I can tell she doesn’t believe me when I insist I haven’t. For the first couple of days, my eyebrows feel sensitive, but by the third day I only remember I’ve had a tattoo when I glance in the mirror. Not a beauty treatment for the faint-hearted, but a needle that’s well worth the jabs.","As FRANCES CHILDS got older her brows became thin, weedy and more obviously uneven .

"As the old saying goes - it seems nice guys really do finish last. A new study has shown that overconfident people are more likely to land the best jobs in life as they can fool others into believing they are more talented than they really are. Experts behind the research also claim that successful people who have an inflated view of their own abilities could partially explain disasters such as the banking collapse in 2008. Researchers said those with an inflated view of their own abilities are more likely to succeed at work (file pictures of models) This is because these people are more likely to overestimate other people's talents, and therefore take greater risks, according to academics from Newcastle and Exeter universities. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, also reported that those who underestimate their own skills are seen as less able than they actually are by colleagues. In the study, 72 students were asked to rate their own ability and the ability of their peers after the first day of their course. Of those, 32 students (about 45 per cent) were under confident in their ability as compared to their final mark, 29 students (40 per cent) were overconfident and 11 (15 per cent) were accurate in their assessments of their own ability. There was a positive correlation between the grades students predicted for themselves and the grades others predicted for them. In other words, students who predicted higher grades for themselves were predicted to have higher grades by others, irrespective of their actual final score. Researchers also claimed that overconfident people are more likely to overestimate other people's talents and therefore take greater risks (file pictures of models) The same applied to those who were under confident. The task was repeated after six weeks of the course when the students knew each other better and the findings remained the same. Those who were overconfident were still over-rated by others. Study author Dr Vivek Nityananda, research associate at Newcastle University's Institute of Neuroscience, said: 'These findings suggest that people don't always reward the most accomplished individual but rather the most self-deceived. 'We think this supports an evolutionary theory of self-deception. The study has linked an evolutionary preference for overconfident people with disasters resulting from risk-taking such as the banking collapse in 2008 (file pictures of models) 'It can be beneficial to have others believe you are better than you are and the best way to do this is to deceive yourself - which might be what we have evolved to do. 'This can cause problems as overconfident people may also be more likely to take risks. 'So if too many people overrate themselves and deceive others about their abilities within organisations, then this could lead to disastrous consequences such as airplane crashes or financial collapses.' Joint lead author Dr Shakti Lamba, of the University of Exeter, added: 'If overconfident people are more likely to be risk prone then by promoting them we may be creating institutions, such as banks and armies, that are more vulnerable to risk.'","Researchers from Newcastle and Exeter universities conducted study .
Students asked to rate own ability and that of peers after first day of course .

"President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron declared on Thursday that their nations would 'not be cowed' by extremists from the Islamic State group who have claimed responsibility for beheading two American journalists. 'If terrorists think we will weaken in the face of their threats they could not be more wrong,' Obama and Cameron wrote in a joint op-ed in the Times of London on the eve of a NATO summit in Wales. Cameron and Obama . called the murders 'utterly despicable' and said they are the 'latest . evidence of a brutal and poisonous extremism that murders . indiscriminately and risks exporting terrorism abroad.' The op-ed follows a claim by Obama on Wednesday that the U.S. could make ISIS a more 'manageable problem' if it were flanked by an international coalition. But U.S. lawmakers say they want fewer words and more action from the Commander in Chief. Members of Congress on both sides of political divide are pressuring Obama to act, and they plan to propose legislation next week that would give the president the authority to continue airstrikes on ISIS - possibly beyond Iraq in Syria, too. Scroll down for video . British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and U.S. President Barack Obama, right, released a joint op-ed overnight declaring that their nations would 'not be cowed' by ISIS. The two world leaders released the manifesto on the eve of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales . Cameron and Obama called the murders of two American journalist 'utterly despicable' and said they are the 'latest evidence of a brutal and poisonous extremism that murders indiscriminately and risks exporting terrorism abroad' NATO . leaders grappled on Thursday with whether the alliance has a role in . containing a mounting militant threat in the Middle East, as heads of . state converged in Wales for a high-stakes summit also focused on the . crisis in Ukraine and next steps in Afghanistan. Obama, Cameron and dozens of other NATO leaders met on a golf resort in Wales for the two-day summit. The U.S. president and British prime minister were expected to pressure their allies to work together to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria and present a united front against Russia over its annexation of eastern Ukraine. 'With more than 60 countries represented at the summit, we can build this proud alliance of transatlantic nations into a more effective security network that fosters stability around the world,' the heads of state said on Thursday. Both the . U.S. and Britain are deeply concerned about the potential threat to . their homelands that could come from the foreign fighters who have . joined the violent Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Earlier . this week Cameron proposed new laws that would give police the power to . seize the passports of Britons suspected of having traveled abroad to . fight with terrorist groups. The . U.S. began launching airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq . last month, and both the U.S. and Britain have been making humanitarian . aid drops to besieged minority groups there. Cameron . said that he hadn't ruled out joining the U.S. in airstrikes, but added . that the priority was to support those already fighting the militants . on the ground. 'We . need to show real resolve and determination, we need to use every power . and everything in our armory with our allies — with those on the ground . — to make sure we do everything we can to squeeze this dreadful . organization out of existence,' Cameron told the British network ITV. Cameron and Obama also visited a class learning about NATO at Mount Pleasant Primary School on Thursday . Secretary of State John Kerry, center, chats with Obama, left, and Cameron, right, during the opening ceremony of the NATO Summit 2014 at the Celtic Manor Resort in Wales . Also facing Obama is a decision about whether to expand U.S. military action against the extremists to Syria. While Obama has said he's considering that step, he has suggested in recent days that it's not imminent. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said on Tuesday that he would file a bill next week that that would give Obama the power to carry out airstrikes in Syria. 'Let . there be no doubt, we must go after ISIS right away because the U.S. is . the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group . that’s intent on barbaric cruelty,' the Florida politician said in a statement. Republican Representative Frank Wolf plans to introduce legislation of his own that would give Obama broad authority to take military action against all terrorist groups, regardless of their location. Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973 the president must receive congressional approval if he plans to engage a country militarily for more than 60 days. If Obama wants to continue airstrikes in Iraq, Congress must give him the green light before October 7. Obama could begin strikes in Syria without the permission of the legislative body, but U.S. officials say Obama is reluctant to delve into country's quagmire on his own. Lawmakers have pressed the president to provide a concrete plan for how he plans to confront the crisis in Syria after he confessed last week that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for that. 'I am of support of going in and not sitting back, but creating a strategy of where we go,' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday in an interview on the Hugh Hewitt Show. 'And if the president won’t act, I think we have to take some action to move forward,' the Republican lawmaker said, according to the Hill. House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers said on the same show that he would support legislation giving White House officials the authority 'to go after ISIS where they find them.' 'They don’t sense borders,' he said. 'We ought not to sense those borders. 'We shouldn’t handcuff ourselves in an effort to degrade and disable their ability to conduct operations,' Rogers added. Obama is expected use some of his discussions in Wales to try to build a coalition that could join him in confronting the Islamic State through a combination of military might, diplomatic pressure and economic penalties. The president 'wants to build an international coalition,' State . Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Wednesday. 'That's not . going to be overnight. We need capabilities from many countries.' Obama administration . officials maintain that the U.S. will not launch a ground war against . the Islamic State militants. Psaki stopped short on Wednesday of ruling out . airstrikes against the group in its safe haven in Syria, as the U.S. has . resisted for years, however. Obama . has 'been clear that we're not going to be limited by geography,' she said. The State Department spokeswoman described a range of actions . being considered against the Islamic State, and noted that decisions and . discussions were ongoing. Over . the past day, Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration . officials have reached out to leaders from Australia, the United Arab Emrites, Jordan, . Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Italy and Israel to discuss how to combat the . Islamic State. Psaki said the discussions focused on what each country . might contribute — including weapons, humanitarian aid and other . resources — and noted that some nations already have. 'Countries that don’t have a lot in common and countries that don’t always cooperate with us are starting to stand up,' White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said on Thursday, adding that those countries were 'starting to see' that ISIS is the 'wolf at their door.' Blinken confirmed to MSNBC that Saudi Arabia may joining forces with the U.S. This image, taken from a video, shows journalist Steven Sotloff kneeling next to a masked Islamic State fighter holding a knife in an unknown location. In the video, released on Tuesday, the masked man murders Sotloff as the extremist group previously warned it would. Sotloff is the second American journalist ISIS has beheaded in the last month . Steven Sotloff's mother Shirley emerged on Wednesday from the family's Miami home for the first time since learning her son had been beheaded. She gave a small wave to media camped out before police guarding the home gave her an escort as she drove out of the gated community . Obama and Cameron visited a local school Thursday morning, where they greeted students learning about NATO before sitting down for a private meeting. Later, the two met with their counterparts from France, Germany and Italy to discuss the crisis in Ukraine. In a show of Western solidarity, new Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko also joined the discussion. Ukraine and Russia have been locked in a standoff for months, with pro-Moscow forces stirring instability in eastern Ukrainian cities. On Wednesday NATO Russia and Ukraine said they were working on a deal to halt the fighting, but Western leaders expressed skepticism — noting it wasn't the first attempt to end the deadly conflict. A centerpiece of the NATO summit was to be the announcement of the rapid response force. Officials said the alliance could position at least 4,000 forces and military equipment in the Baltics and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. 'Russia has ripped up the rulebook with its illegal, self-declared annexation of Crimea and its troops on Ukrainian soil threatening a sovereign nation state,' Obama and Cameron wrote. 'We must use our military to ensure a persistent presence in Eastern Europe, making clear to Russia that we will always uphold our Article 5 commitments to collective self-defense,' they said. Under Article 5 of the NATO charter, an attack on one member state is viewed on an attack on the whole alliance. Obama and Cameron said on Thursday that members of NATO 'who want to adopt an isolationist approach misunderstand the nature of security in the 21st century. 'Developments in other parts of the world, particularly in Iraq and Syria, threaten our security at home,' they stated. Arriving . at the summit site on Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh . Rasmussen said he believes the broader international community 'has an . obligation to stop the Islamic State from advancing further,' but noted . that the alliance hasn't received any request for help. 'I'm . sure that if the Iraqi government were to forward a request for NATO . assistance, that would be considered seriously by NATO allies,' Rasmussen said.","'If terrorists think we will weaken in the face of their threats they could not be more wrong,' Obama and Cameron wrote in a joint op-ed .

"Rumours of Harrison Smith following Earl Thomas as safety-turned punt returner are greatly exaggerated. But anyone who witnessed his 81-yard interception touchdown against the St Louis Rams cannot fail to be impressed. 'Those days left me in high school, I guess,' Smith says after his dart into the end zone put the gloss on the Minnesota Vikings' crushing 34-6 win. Harrison Smith of the Minnesota Vikings returns an interception for a touchdown  at the Edward Jones Dome . St Louis Rams' Cory Harkey is upended by Minnesota Vikings' Harrison Smith as  Chad Greenway, left, looks on . As starts go, it was impressive. But the level-headed 25-year-old is rightly refusing to get carried away. 'It’s a confidence-builder. It’s a great place to start and we did a lot of good things but there’s still a lot to improve on and a lot to correct so we just need to focus on getting those things done and getting better. 'For starters getting the yards down in the passing game. Especially being a defensive back. I think we gave up like 250/260 yards which is too much for us. But getting turnovers was big, getting sacks was big and keeping points down is the overall goal.' Thursday: Pittsburgh at Baltimore . Sunday: Miami at Buffalo . Jacksonville at Washington . Dallas at Tennessee . Arizona at NY Giants . New England at Minnesota . New Orleans at Cleveland . Atlanta at Cincinnati . Detroit at Carolina . St Louis at Tampa Bay . Seattle at San Diego . Houston at Oakland . NY Jets at Green Bay . Kansas City at Denver . Chicago at San Francisco . Monday: Philadelphia at Indianapolis . Smith missed half of last season with turf toe - a major factor in the Vikings conceding an average of over 30 points a game. And as he enters his third NFL season, he agrees he is one of the leaders of Mike Zimmer's aggressive, confusing new defensive scheme. 'I would say my approach to the game and my approach to everyday showing up is being a guy that is accountable. Of being a guy that coaches can rely on. 'Watching other guys has helped me. Chad Greenway is a guy on the team who’s an obvious leader on the defense, he’s a guy I’ve learned a ton from and continue to learn from. So I'm still trying to grow with that role and get better at it.' Zimmer and general manager Rick Spielman began their overhaul of the defense in March, with the free agency additions of run-stuffing defensive tackle Linval Joseph from the New York Giants and cornerback Captain Munnerlyn from the Carolina Panthers. 'Both huge additions,' Smith says. 'Linval, not only is he a great run-stopper - he kind of clogs up that middle - he’s a real athletic guy. Gets a lot of pressure on the quarterback and that showed up on Sunday. 'Captain, not only can he play corner but he comes into that nickel spot. He’s an aggressive player. Physical. Makes plays on the ball, tackles really well. So when he’s out there he’s going to make his presence known. I’m just happy to have him on our side.' Smith's score was the third of his career from 25 games - trailing Munnerlyn's five from 78. 'He’s got a little bit of a lead on me. We were joking about that after the game, so I’m trying to catch him,' he laughs. Linval Joseph of the Minnesota Vikings celebrates after sacking Austin Davis of the St Louis Rams . St Louis Rams wide receiver Brian Quick hooks the facemask of Minnesota cornerback Captain Munnerlyn . After joining the Vikings from Notre Dame in the 2012 draft, he knows the path from the first round (selected 29th) to starter well. He praised lockermate Anthony Barr, the giant linebacker who came from UCLA as the ninth pick in May's draft. 'Obviously Anthony Barr is a guy who you know, he’s a ballplayer. That was obvious as soon as he stepped onto the field. And him being in our defense too, you really don’t think of him as a rookie. Minnesota Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer waves as he walks off the field in St Louis . 'He’s going to get his job done, he’s going to make plays not a lot of people can make and it’s going to be exciting to see what he really becomes after he gets a few games under his belt because he’s already doing things that not a lot of people can do.' 'He gets pressure on the quarterback, makes tackles in space, great in the coverage game and put some pretty good hits on the quarterback on Sunday, so it’s nice having him as an addition.' In Smith's first season, a Vikings team packed with defensive stalwarts such as Kevin Williams, Jared Allen and Antoine Winfield won their final four regular season games to reach the play-offs. Smith remembers his time with the now-retired Winfield fondly. 'I learned how to be a pro really from him. Just sitting in a room with him, just seeing how he shows up does his job. Great guy on and off the field and somebody to really look up to.' A keen student of the game, Zimmer has spoken in glowing terms of the disruptive Smith's willingness to learn. Before his injury last October, he looked set for the Pro Bowl, and his conscientious approach to the game is to be admired. 'You want to improve on things that you have control over,' he says. There’s times when you can do extra. Times when you need to watch extra film. Times when you need to spend extra time getting your body right, working out, so I think part of learning to be a pro and to be efficient is knowing when to work on those things. Because you can’t just work yourself into the ground in all areas: you’re not going to last very long - it’s a long season. So you need to know what to improve on. And get it done and that’s something I’ve tried to learn more and more every season.' 'There’s guys I have a ton of respect for and like watching on film. [Troy] Polamalu, obviously. Brian Dawkins. I got to watch [Eric] Weddle last night. Guys all over making plays. Ed Reed was a guy who made unbelievable things happen. So you try and learn stuff from guys watching films every week. You can pick up some things that a guy will do here and there and just try and add things to your game.' Rams quarterback Austin Davis throws an interception to Minnesota Vikings free safety Harrison Smith . 'Growing up I remember one of the first guys I was excited to see play the position was Steve Atwater. It was toward the end of his career at Denver. He was a guy, I remember watching the Broncos against the Packers and he hit one of the Packers receivers and one of the Broncos corners on the same play. He was a guy that was fun to watch when I was really young.' Next up, the Vikings welcome the might of the Patriots to the TCF Bank Stadium. Stinging from a 20-33 defeat against Miami Dolphins, Smith knows facing the learned mind of Bill Belichick and a modern great in the shape of Tom Brady will be tough. But that's why he plays the game. 'Obviously, he’s one of the best to play that position. I’m excited to go against a guy of his calibre, which there are not many of. Just even to play against them it’s kind of what we look forward to; playing against the best. We’re going to get ready to play and we’ll see where the chips fall after Sunday.' And as well as being a major part of a new look team, the hard-hitting Smith also has a new nickname. Christened 'Harry the Hitman' by ebullient play-by-play caller Paul Allen, it is a moniker he is embracing. 'I like it. He asked me if it was OK to call me it. And I gave him the go-ahead. PA does a great job. And it’s fun to hear him get excited on the play-by-plays.' And if the Vikings go to 2-0 on Sunday, both Smith and Allen will have much to be excited about.","Smith ran 81-yards for an interception touchdown as the Vikings thrashed the St Louis Rams 34-6 .

"A Penn State student is gaining an Internet reputation as a 'squirrel whisperer' thanks to her amazing ability to get a wild campus squirrel named Sneezy to pose in hilarious photos. Mary Krupa routinely dresses up the Eastern gray squirrel in hats and with props like pencils or tea cups to create scenes both adorable and little otherworldy--all for just peanuts. Sneezy happily strikes poses for the crunchy treats and her tameness, along with Krupa's uncanny persuasion skills, have turned the costumed critter into a kind of unofficial internet school mascot. Wild America: A Penn State student has turned a campus squirrel into an internet celebrity by taking pictures of it in various cute poses, with props and in tiny paper hats . Chilling: Mary Krupa, a Penn State junior, has dubbed the squirrel Sneezy for its frequent sneezes . Costs just peanuts: Sneezy is a wild Eastern gray squirrel that was born on the Penn State campus in State College, Pennsylvania and happens to be willing to pose for photos . Krupa, whose Facebook photos of Sneezy have gained international attention, even says a German magazine who interviewed her actually thought the squirrel was Penn State's mascot. 'They got a little confused,' she told WJAC. Make no mistake, though--if popularity along decided, Sneezy would be a shoo-in. The Facebook page Krupa runs for the squirrel actually has more 'Likes' than the school's actual masco, Nittany Lion. Krupa's method is simple. She offers Sneezy a peanut and, while the squirrel nibbles, she puts a hat on her. To get Sneezy to hold props, like the tea cup she used in an English tea party-themed shoot, she simply smears a little peanut butter on whatever she wants the squirrel to hold. Fighting form: Sneezy is always up to the task of taking photos for Krupa, so long as the Penn State junior offers her peanuts during the shoot . Squirrel full of multitudes: Whether its a motorcycle or teacup, Sneezy is willing to hold it--so long as it's smeared with peanut buitter . Buzz: Krupa created a Facebook page for Sneezy and the response has been huge. Thanks to the hilarious photos, Sneezy the Penn State Squirrel has received 20,000 likes . As easy as it sounds, Krupa makes clear that Sneezy is in control. 'I can never force her to do anything she doesn't want to do,' she told NPR. 'I mean, if she gets tired she'll just go up the tree.' Krupa discovered the friendliness of the campus squirrels when she was a freshman. She's now a junior and has befriended multiple squirrels. However, Sneezy--who got her name from her frequent adorable sneezes--likes Krupa the most, and the feeling is mutual. While other squirrels have let Krupa put hats on them, Sneezy is always the most willing. 'As long as she has food she is completely relaxed and really comfortable with people. She is just the sweetest, laid back squirrel ever,' Krupa said. Like magic: While other squirrels have relented to Krupa putting hats on them, only Sneezy is eager to come and play dress-up . All American: Sneezy has even outstripped actual Penn State mascot the Nittany Lion in number of Facebook likes . High brow: A German magazine even mistakenly wrote that Sneezy the Squirrel is, in fact, the mascot of the school of some 35,000 undergrads .","Mary Krupa started befriending the campus squirrels as a freshman and has since become closest to Sneezy .

"Tragedy: Samuel Epps, 11, died of an apparent suicide Tuesday night after shooting himself . A young boy is dead in what is being considered an apparent suicide after firing a single bullet into his head earlier this week. Samuel Epps, 11, of San Tan Valley, Arizona, was home with his father and three siblings Tuesday evening when, after getting into an argument over his chores, he ran off and locked himself in the house's master bedroom. Moments later, he reportedly turned a gun on himself and fired. 'Initial information indicates that Samuel had been asked to complete some chores and he became upset,' Pinal County Sheriff's Office spokesman Tim Gaffney said in a news release. 'Samuel went into the home's master bedroom and a short time later a single gunshot was heard by other family members.' According to NBC 12, investigators believe that Samuel used an off-duty weapon belonging to his father, who is a supervisor with the Arizona State University Police Department. It is still unclear how exactly he got the handgun. When medical personnel arrived on the scene, they reported that Samuel was still breathing and had a pulse, but he was pronounced dead two hours later after being flown to Maricopa Medical Center. 'This child, from our understanding, had no intention to play with the weapon but to harm himself, and so that dramatic decision was made in this young child's mind to likely result in ending his life,' said Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu. There is no evidence that Samuel exhibited depression, mental illness or suicidal thoughts, according to detectives. Devastated: Many have donated money to help the family pay for Samuel's funeral . The family is said to be 'devastated' according to a page trying to raise funds for Samuel's funeral. So far, they have collected over $20,000.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has attacked Uefa’s Champions League rules that have allowed Arsenal to have an easier draw in this season’s competition than his own team. Pellegrini considers it unfair to be facing tournament favourites Bayern Munich in their group for the third time in four seasons despite winning the Premier League while fourth-place Arsenal, who had to come through a qualifying tie to reach the group stage, were classified as top seeds and are odds-on to qualify past Borussia Dortmund, Galatasaray and Anderlecht. Current Champions League seedings depend on previous results in the tournament rather than how they did in their domestic league which favours traditionally strong clubs like Arsenal rather than an emerging force such as City. City have failed to progress beyond the last-16 in three attempts following tough draws which have seen them paired with the likes of Bayern and Real Madrid and Pellegrini, whose side play their first group game of this season’s tournament in Bayern’s Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night, thinks it is time to reward teams for becoming Premier League champions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: We haven't breached Financial Fair Play (ARCHIVE) Manuel Pellegrini criticised UEFA and thinks Arsenal were given a more favourable Champions League draw . In a clear comparison with Arsenal, Pellegrini said: ‘I don´t think it´s good that the teams who play qualification because they finished fourth in their domestic leagues are in pot one (top seeds), where the strongest teams should be. ‘In our group we have three domestic champions, the English champions, the German champions, and the Russian champions (CSKA Moscow). So our group seems a bit unbalanced. ‘Maybe in the future there will be a system for the teams in the pots which goes according to their position in their leagues and the points won in Europe. ‘I think we need to find a modification whereby, for example, all teams who play qualification go into pot four, and all champions of their respective leagues and have a lot of points in Europe (a high coefficient) go into pot one. ‘There is a need for some modifications to not let something like what happened to us happen again, while the teams that play preliminaries appear to be the most important ones in Europe. Arsenal and Manchester City drew 2-2 in their Premier League clash on Saturday at The Emirates . Manchester City have failed to seriously challenge for the Champions League so far in their short history . ‘I think that the champions of England and the champions of the German league, with both leagues being among the best leagues in Europe, they deserve to be in pot one.’ Ironically, City and Arsenal faced each other in the Premier League on Saturday. Pellegrini was hired by City to replace Roberto Mancini at the start of last season because of his Champions League success with Malaga who he took to the quarter-finals in 2013. He managed to take City into the knockout stages for the first time in their history but were eliminated by Barcelona in the last-16 after finishing runners-up in their group to Bayern. He now faces another tough task against Bayern, CSKA and Serie A runners-up Roma, who include Ashley Cole, but hopes last season’s run will help. ‘The fact of having qualified for the knockout stages having been in the toughest group increases the confidence of the players for this season and the future. I hope, but you never know of course, that we will see a more mature Manchester City in the Champions League, and a Manchester City that will try to do better than the year before. Arsenal scraped past Besiktas in a play-off after finishing fourth in the Premier League last season . ‘Our win in Munich and the close tie against Barcelona when we had 10 men has given us extra confidence.’ While Real Madrid boast Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale, and Barcelona Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, Pellegrini has his own Galactico ready to explode. ‘I think that Sergio Agüero is among the best players in the world and I think it is now up to him to make it and fight for the Ballon D´Or as best player, because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player,’ he said. ‘He is technically very strong, he is fast and has a lot of power. He is very intelligent, able to play in his position in between midfield and attack. And so we hope to see Sergio back in the form he demonstrated in the Premier League before his injuries hit him, and I think that he will make a difference this season.’","Manchester City drawn against Bayern Munich, Roma and CSKA Moscow .

"Rangers have agreed an out-of-court settlement with former commercial director Imran Ahmad, who was suing the club for breach of contract. Ahmad last week won the right to arrest £620,000 from the club's bank account pending the court case in light of their ongoing financial difficulties. Rangers were given leave to appeal that Court of Session decision with their case due to be heard in two months, but they announced an imminent end to the case in a statement to the London Stock Exchange on Friday morning. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Graham Wallace denies Rangers will enter insolvency (archive) Rangers' former commercial director Imran Ahmad has reached an out of court settlement with the club . Ahmad had claimed he was owed £500,000 in unpaid bonuses from Rangers. The statement read: 'Rangers have agreed formal terms of settlement with former commercial director Imran Ahmad regarding his current court action. 'The sum agreed is significantly less than the total amount which Mr Ahmad had been granted permission to arrest. 'As part of the settlement terms Mr Ahmad has agreed to refrain from arresting funds in Rangers' bank account or in the hands of others pending the formal removal of the case from court. 'No such arrestment will now take place. The case will be formally taken out of court in the next few days.' Rangers were granted leave to appeal the decision to freeze £620,000 of the club's assets last week . Ahmad was Charles Green's main partner when his consortium took control of Ibrox in an assets purchase of the liquidation-hit Rangers in June 2012. He left his role in April 2013, while Green had quit as chief executive the previous week following claims over links with former Rangers owner Craig Whyte. The news of the settlement came hours before the deadline for applications for the latest Rangers share issue, from which the club hope to raise almost £4million. When the issue was launched two weeks ago, the board issued warnings about their ability to meet financial obligations if the fundraising exercise fails.","The Ibrox side continue to face ongoing financial difficulties .

"News that Hello Kitty, the Japanese cartoon character created by Sanrio, is not a cat but actually a little girl called Kitty White, has devastated millions of fans. But no one was more overwhelmed by the news than this little girl, who could not contain her shock, horror and disbelief that the popular character is not who she seemed to be. The youngster, Lou, was utterly dismayed at the revelation. And she didn't hold back her feelings, venting at her mother who filmed her dramatic reaction and posted it on YouTube. Not actually a cat: The character is actually a real human little girl who lives outside of London, has a twin sister, and a cat of her own . ‘What’s the matter, Lou?’ her mother asks. ‘What did you just find out?’ ‘I’m not talking,’ Lou says. And then proceeds to let rip, demonstrating an eloquence far beyond her  years. ‘Hello Kitty is not an actual cat,’ she says, on the verge of tears, lips a-quiver and with a wobble in her voice. But she doesn't let her emotions take over. Flabbergasted: Lou hates the fact that Hello Kitty, who celebrates her 40th birthday this year, isn't a cat . ‘She’s a little girl,’ the child continues, clearly disbelieving the news. ‘And how does that make you feel? You don’t like it?’ her mother asks. ‘I hate it,’ the child says vehemently, staring at the camera. ‘She looks like a cat,’ she screams. And quite sensibly as well. Articulating every word, the girl continues, ‘She cannot be a human.’ Close to tears: The child is clearly upset at Sanrio's decision to announce Hello Kitty's non-feline credentials . Her hands raised to stress every point, Lou finds herself at a loss for words when asked to explain further . Her hands raised to stress every point, the girl finds herself at a loss for words when asked to explain further. ‘She is a cat that acts like a human, like a usual cartoon.

Looking utterly fed up with having to explain the fundamental difference between cats and human beings, the child sighs deeply, saying ‘I hate it.’ Not a cat: The Japanese cartoon character was 'born' in 1974 and is loved all over the world . Another little voice chimes in, asking, ‘But why is the show called Hello Kitty?’. ‘Because apparently her name is Kitty White. I don’t like it,’ she pouts. ‘I’m sorry,’ her mother says. ‘You’re not posting this on Facebook either,’ the child ends the tirade. ‘My daughter didn't appreciate the truth about Hello Kitty,’ the mother posted on YouTube .

Mercedes are standing by Lewis Hamilton's extraordinary claim that Nico Rosberg told him that he deliberately crashed into him in Sunday's bitter Belgian Grand Prix. Sources within the team told Sportsmail that Hamilton's account of the post-race meeting was 'broadly correct'. The two Mercedes men clashed on the second lap - Rosberg’s front wing punctured Hamilton’s rear left tyre and ultimately forced the British driver to retire from the race - as the world championship fight broke out into open warfare.

April 6: During the third race of the season in Bahrain, Hamilton cuts across Rosberg, almost causing a crash. Rosberg appeals to the team over radio, saying 'Tell him that was not on!'. The British driver holds on to win the race, with Rosberg second. May 11: In Spain Hamilton switches engine modes without the team's permission to hold off Rosberg and win the race. May 24: Qualifying for the Monaco Grand Prix sees the two drivers have their most public flashpoint. Rosberg crashes while on course for pole, denying Hamilton the chance to set a quicker time. Hamilton alleges the crash was deliberate but the German is cleared of any intent. Rosberg wins the race from pole. August 24: The two drivers collide on lap two in Belgium, with Rosberg later admitting he did not try to prevent the crash. Hamilton, who was visibly emotional after speaking to Rosberg about the incident, claimed: ‘I was gobsmacked when I was in the meeting. ‘He (Nico) basically said he did it on purpose. He said he could have avoided it. He said he did it to prove a point. He said it was all my fault.’ That last comment referred to the animosity that has been building up between the two men for months. Rosberg was angry that Hamilton cut across him in Bahrain; Hamilton felt Rosberg deliberately scuppered his qualifying lap in Monaco; and, perhaps most importantly, Rosberg was still fuming that Hamilton did not follow a team order at the last race in Hungary.

The support has been great - so many British flags and tops, and I’m gutted I wasn’t able to get a result for them this weekend.’ Rosberg was booed by Hamilton’s supporters on the podium after coming second to Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo. The German now leads the championship by 29 points with seven races remaining. Ripped: Hamilton limps into the pits with a totally torn up rear left tyre .

Rosberg’s management did not respond to Hamilton’s claims directly, saying he prefers to ‘discuss things internally’. However, Rosberg publicly mainatained it was ‘a racing incident’ rather than a deliberate act of malice. However, his team bosses did not agree on Sunday. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, said: ‘It is unacceptable that in the second lap Nico hit Lewis, completely unacceptable. ‘If these things happen at the end of the race, when they are fighting for the win then OK, but in the second lap to hand the victory to Red Bull is madness.’ Booed: Rosberg was jeered when he took the podium to claim his second-place prize after the race .

"Nico Rosberg has called on Formula One fans to 'forgive and forget' after being booed on the podium for the second successive race. Following his collision on the second lap of the Belgian Grand Prix with Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, which led to the Briton later retiring, Rosberg was severely heckled as he collected his trophy for finishing second. Rosberg suggested post-race it was 'the British people' who had turned against him, but the scenes following the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday confirmed it was not just Hamilton's countrymen now against him.

Being cast in the role of villain, when for so long he has been viewed as a nice guy, is clearly a concern for Rosberg.

"The U.S. Navy has launched a new 12 million gallon indoor ocean the size of a football field to test its future warships. The high-tech facility is based at the Naval Surface Warfare Centre (NSWC) in Washington. The tank was first built in 1962 but for the past six years it has undergone a dramatic renovation. Originally, the facility had a large pneumatic wave making machine. These have been replaced by 216 individually-controlled electro-mechanical wave boards. Making waves: The new high-tech  machine, can create any type of sea condition at the push of a button . According to engineers at the facility, the new wave machine produces more precise data . Jon Etxegoien,head of the NSW Carderock Naval architecture and engineering department said: 'This new finger-style technology provides the Navy with an unprecedented capability to create a realistic ocean environment inside of the facility, which enables us to collect more precise test data . 'This upgrade, along with the size of the facility, makes the MASK the most advanced test facility of its kind in the world.' His colleague Joseph Moeller said the new system allows them to mimic the ocean's most extreme conditions on demand. He said: 'In this facility, we can test scale models up to 30 feet in length in order to predict the full-scale performance of ships in the open ocean. We are very excited to begin exploring the facility's new capabilities and integrating them with our existing test equipment.' The tank is 360 feet long and 240 feet wide and holds in the region of 12 million gallons of water. It is able to test the scale model of ships and moored platforms in all types of sea conditions. Engineers are able to create specific wave types from all different weather conditions. The facility can test models of US naval vessels and how they will perform in different conditions (file photo) Speaking to The Smithsonian Mr Etxegoien said: 'There are no freak waves in the world. They are all predicable.' The computer controlled systems can create sea conditions from dead calm to a typhoon. It also has the ability to mimic particular sea conditions from an individual ocean. As well as testing the handling characteristics of various ships in all weather conditions. The tank can help assess the extreme limits where a ship can launch a missile or if a helicopter can land on deck. Also, engineers can test the impact of the weight of a vessel and how it handles, whether the warship has a full fuel tank or is almost empty. According to The Smithsonian, in the past, engineers had to bring remote control vessels to the open ocean during particular weather events which was deemed inefficient. With the new system, engineers can mimic a six-week cruise in a fraction of the time. The system has the ability to test models at speeds of up to 50 knots. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert recently visited the facility to receive a briefing on its capabilities. He said: 'Technology is moving fast, and some of that technology is being grabbed and put into military systems.' Addressing personnel at the facility he said: 'What you do here, make no mistake, is a major part of our advantage. When I talk to the folks who design and test the technology, what you do is astounding; it not only is good ship building, but it's also good ship design.' The facility is currently testing the new $7billion DDC 1000 destroyer as well as a new design of submarine.","The facility, which was built in 1962, has undergone a 6-year-long upgrade .

"Nude pictures of celebrities leaked online may have been stolen using a rudimentary hacking technique known as phishing rather than a sophisticated sting, experts believe. Phishing scams involve tricking users into handing over passwords or personal information, often using an email which looks like it's from a legitimate company asking for details. Banks have cautioned against such scams for years, telling customers that they will never ask for account details or passwords in email messages. But investigators probing the celebrity leaks are now thought to be looking at the possibility that at least some of the hacked star's details may have been obtained by phishing. Scroll down for video . Experts believe hackers may have got access to celebrity iCloud accounts using phishing, a scam which tricks  users into handing over details by sending a message appearing to be from a legitimate company . Experts believe hackers used a computer to guess the answers to stars' secret questions (below) using widely-known personal details, then used phishing attacks to get their usernames (above) In order to bypass security on an account you usually need two things, a username and an answer to a secret question. In the case of the celebrity leaks, experts believe hackers used a programme which cracked the stars' secret questions by making repeated guesses using personal information available online. However, knowing the username - usually an email address associated with the account - is more difficult. For that, hackers may have used a phishing attack to gain access to one email account, before getting the email addresses of other stars from a contact book. Apple . confirmed yesterday that the leaks were the result of a 'targeted . attack on user names, passwords and security questions', otherwise known . as a brute-force attack. In a brute-force attack a computer programme is used to repeatedly guess at a password until it finds the right combination. In . this case, the celebrity status of the victims makes them much more . vulnerable, as so much information about them, such as the names of pets . or ex-partners, is already public knowledge. However, . any hacker would also have to have access to the target's user name, usually an email associated with the account, which . is where phishing comes in. Experts . believe hackers must have compromised at least one of the stars' accounts, and then used this account to access other email addresses, . which could have been stored in a contact book. Then, using this information, the hackers could have gained access to other iCloud accounts, which might explain the large number of victims. According . to TMZ, FBI investigators are looking into whether Kate Upton, Mary . Elizabeth Winstead, Jennifer Lawrence, or Lea Michele were the target of . the phishing attack. Today actress Denise Richards revealed that she was messaged more than ten . times by suspected hackers asking for her iCloud password and threatening to . shut down her accounts if she did not respond. Denise . Richards tweeted today that she had received over ten emails asking for . her password and threatening to shut down her accounts if she did not . respond . Kim Kardashian described this week's celebrity iCloud hack as a 'wake up call' 'Whether . or not iCloud was the point of compromise in this incident, scammers . have been interested in stealing these credentials for some time,' explained Satnam Narang from security firm Symantec. 'These . emails contain links to phishing websites that will capture your Apple . ID credentials and send them back to the attackers. Apple said . it was 'outraged' by the attacks, and advised worried customers to . update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step . verification. 'Our customers' privacy and security are of utmost importance to us,' it said in a statement. 'We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities. ""In the case of celebrities, these secret questions are very easy to find . online - either in Wikipedia or by searching through some interviews"" 'When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple's engineers to discover the source.' 'After . more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain . celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user . names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all . too common on the Internet.' The news comes as Kim Kardashian described this week's celebrity iCloud hack as a 'wake up call'. 'I think people in general just have to be cautious,' she told the BBC's Newsbeat, telling them 'I don't have an iCloud account on my phone'. Jeffifer Lawrence and model Cara Delevingne are among those hit by the leaks so far . MailOnline . revealed that Hackers could have gained access to celebrity iCloud . accounts using just an email address and a search engine. The . system allows people to reset a password by answering two security . questions - the answers to which can often be found online for celebrity . users. Apple . does message users to tell them their password has been changed, but if . a hacker has access to their email account this notification can be . deleted before they ever see it. Rich Mogull, a security expert with Securosis, warned celebrities not to use the real answers to these questions as hackers would be able to find many of the answers online. Security consultant Graham Cluley also warned that more users could become vulnerable to attacks, as the iCloud serivce will be used to move data across to the new iPhone.","Phishing emails trick people into handing over security information .

"1. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 238 points . 2. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 216 points . 3. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) 166 points . The notion that Lewis Hamilton did not win the Italian Grand Prix fair and square is about as believable as Elvis faking his own death. Both can be found in the file under ‘f’ for far-fetched. The incident that turned the race in Hamilton’s favour was when he was pursuing Rosberg along the start straight at 220mph. The German seemingly cracked, ran straight on at the chicane and surrendered the lead. The TV camera caught Mercedes boss Toto Wolff smiling on the pit wall. The cynics took this as a sign that he had ordered Rosberg to give way to make up for having crashed into Hamilton in the previous race in Spa, and was delighted to see the crafty plan carried out so adroitly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hamilton returns to winning ways . Winner: Lewis Hamilton gives the thums up to the Monza crowd after winning the Italian Grand Prix ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg .

Nightmare start: Nico Rosberg got off the line quickly as Hamilton got stuck behind Kevin Magnussen and Felipe Massa in fourth place . Fighting back: Hamilton showed his racing instincts to battle back to the front, pulling off a fantastic overtake to get past Massa on lap 10 . Down and out: Britain's Max Chilton crashed out early after making an error, losing control and hitting the barrier . VIDEO Hamilton returns to winning ways . Sir Jackie Stewart, the three-time world champion, was not convinced. ‘There was very little rubber smoke. I don’t quite understand why it happened on a very easy part of the track. I thought it was a bit too easy. He could have at least made an effort to get round the corner but he didn’t.’ Fuel to the conspiracy fire is that Rosberg made the same mistake at the same point earlier in the race. Barring Daniil Kvyat’s brake failure, no other driver missed the chicane all race. Stewart added: ‘The first time I thought “that’s wise”; the second time I thought: “hello, what’s going on here?”’ Formula One is not totally unused to such things. The 2008 Singapore Grand Prix was fixed by Renault asking Nelson Piquet Jnr to crash to let Fernando Alonso win. But Piquet was a desperate man seeking a new contract. Rosberg is fighting for the world drivers’ championship. ‘I just messed up,’ said the German. ‘What would be the reason for me to do something like that deliberately? There is no possible reason. ‘If you’re ordered by the team to do it then you would do it, but there is no reason why the team would ask me to change position, or something like that. ‘The only thing in people’s minds could be Spa, but Spa was a mistake I’ve apologised for. ‘It’s not like we are now starting to shuffling our cars.’ Wolff was even more emphatic, saying: ‘Only a paranoid mind would have dreamed up such an idea.’ Indeed, why go to such lengths to fix the result when there are so many easier ways of doing it? They could have issued an order over the radio or fumbled a pit stop? In the total absence of evidence of a foul play, I would rather give credit to Hamilton for the stridency of his driving that forced the mistake from the usually unflappable Rosberg. Hamilton’s victory – his sixth of the season – was achieved despite an awful start that took him from pole to fourth position by the first corner after a technical problem with his launch setting. He recovered manfully, even seizing the initiative to charge at Rosberg there and then despite the advice from the pit wall to sit back and conserve his tyres for the end of the race. His sense of adventure, shrewd tactical judgment, meant he was on Rosberg’s tail by 29th and pivotal lap. Rosberg went off when Lewis was just over a second behind him. Hamilton was untroubled all afternoon. Rosberg came home second, his lead trimmed to 22 points with six races remaining. Finally, Hamilton had had some luck in a season that has tripped him up at every turn. Watching slightly fretfully, as is his wont, was Lewis’s father Anthony and his step-mother Linda. Anthony’s verdict was both blunt and encouraging. ‘Lewis drove the way he knows best and that is what he needs to do from now on,’ he said. ‘He can catch up in this championship. It is just head down and drive like he did in go-karts – to win. Drive to win, no other way. ‘What has happened to Lewis in the past few weeks has been unreal. Sometimes things go well and then they go badly. It is down to the strength of character of the driver to keep plugging away and be honest about hard it is. It is not about engines or anything, it is about getting out there and doing your job. ‘It is all character building but it is extraordinary – and that is why I am feeling this extra special something, that this championship is about giving Lewis such a hard time but he comes through it. We just have to keep the faith.’ Away from Mercedes, there was a minor disaster for Ferrari. Fernando Alonso was non-classified for the first time in five years when his battery pack gave up on him. Kimi Raikkonen scored a mere two points. It was hardly what the throng who made their traditional post-race pilgrimage along the start straight wanted. But there were many others – Union Jack-waving British fans – among the tifosi got the winner they craved. Some of them again, regrettably, booed Rosberg for his Spa mistake. Hamilton was cheered loudly. He had finally secured a psychological blow, one that will mean far more to him if, as seems likely, it was earned fairly.

"The life of a New York State resident came to a shocking and grisly end Monday when police say he committed suicide by beheading himself in The Bronx. Tomas Rivera, 51, from Port Jervis, New York, tied his head with a chain to a pole in the Hunts Point section of the borough and then pressed the gas pedal on his car. Moments later, the man was decapitated, with his severed head left lying in the middle of Longfellow Avenue. Ghastly scene: Tomas Rivera, 51, beheaded himself on Longfellow Avenue in The Bronx (pictured) using a chain and his Honda Pilot . According to police speaking to New York Daily News, the incident took place just after 9.30am Monday in the 500 block of Longfellow Avenue. Tomas Rivera attached a chain to an electric pole and then settled behind the wheel of his white 2005 Honda Pilot. The other end of the metal cable was tied around his neck. The motorist then put the vehicle in drive, police say, and as the Honda lurched forward, Rivera’s head was ripped from his body. The out-of-control vehicle continued speeding down the street before it crashed into a parked car. The impact of the collision caused Tomas Rivera's headless body to be ejected from the Honda onto the street, New York Post reported. Pedestrians who came upon the horrific sight of the headless body initially thought the death was the result of a tragic accident.

The report contains a disclaimer that 'this plan was not actually designed as a joke', but it originated  after military planners in Omaha, Nebraska, wanted a scenario for dealing with a widespread national emergency. The Pentagon's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in from an unclassified document called 'CONOP 8888' - otherwise known as 'Counter-Zombie Dominance' They created a zombie attack plan that covered training civilians how to survive in a post-apocalyptic world - deployment of military was also a large factor in the plans.

"Victim: Hannah Smith, 14, has killed herself after being bullied by anonymous trolls online . A teenager was found hanged at her home after suffering months of bullying by anonymous ‘trolls’ on a notorious website. Hannah Smith, 14, was taunted on Ask.fm – linked to at least four teenage deaths in the past year – over her weight, the death of an uncle and an apparent propensity to self-harm. She had also been urged to ‘drink bleach’ by the anonymous tormentors, friends said. The tragedy comes amid a continuing escalation of the abusive and threatening ‘trolling’ of high-profile women on Twitter. In the aftermath of Hannah’s apparent suicide, her devastated father, David, took to Facebook to urge parents to stop their children using the Latvian-based Ask.fm, which has been condemned as a ‘stalker’s paradise’ by child safety experts. Mr Smith called for its creators to be prosecuted for manslaughter. Less than a fortnight before her body was found early last Friday, Hannah begged her tormentors – who can hide behind a cloak of anonymity on the site – to stop the abuse. In another post, she told one bully who had branded her an ‘ugly f*****’ how she had already attempted suicide and added: ‘Getting things like this from people that like to hide behind there (sic) computer screen doesn’t make me feel any better.’ Writing on Facebook on Saturday, Mr Smith, a 45-year-old lorry driver, said: ‘I have just seen the abuse my daughter got from people on ask fm and the fact that these people can be anonymous is wrong. 'The person that created this website should be done for manslaughter.’ Mr Smith split up with his first wife Tracey, 35, seven years ago and raised daughters Hannah and Joanne, 16, with his second wife Deb in Lutterworth, Leicestershire.

Moving: Flowers left outside Dave Smith's house in Lutterworth as a tribute for his daughter Hannah . Taunts and abusive comments written . in teenage ‘text speak’ remained visible on Hannah’s Ask.fm profile . yesterday, which Hannah last used on Thursday. In her final days, she . had been branded a ‘cow’ and ‘fat sl**’ – but had also been praised on . her appearance and told she was ‘fit’ by others. On July 20, a vile troll wrote, ‘u . ugly f*** go die evry1 wuld be happy’, prompting Hannah to reply: ‘yes, i . may be ugly, but you obviously have an ugly personality to tell people . to ‘go die’!’ Upsetting: Hannah's family and friends have paid tribute to the 'beautiful' 14-year-old . Other hurtful posts urged her to ‘do us all a favour n kill ur self’ and ‘go comit suicide’. Hannah replied: ‘wouldn’t you fell bad if I did ey?’ Just the day before she apparently . killed herself, Hannah posted a picture message on Facebook which read: . ‘You think you want to die, but in reality you just want to be saved.’ Her distraught father yesterday declined to add to his Facebook postings, while Hannah’s mother could not be contacted. Hannah’s boyfriend Kris Cooper, from . Leicester, wrote on Facebook: ‘RIP Hannah Jayne Louise May Smith. Heaven has gained a beautiful angel.’ Friends and family also set up a .

Upsetting: Hannah Smith and her father Dave when she was a baby and and as a teenager, and he said today Ask.fm were 'dancing on her grave' Row: Ask.fm says it does not take full responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts, which has led to advertisers leaving them in droves .

His messaged read: ' @Murkztah_: @stellacreasy I'm gonna be the first thing u see when u wake up'. A terrifying picture of a masked man brandishing a large kitchen knife has been sent to a female MP as the abusive 'trolling' of high-profile women on Twitter continues to escalate. Labour's Stella Creasy was warned by the troll: 'I’m gonna be the first thing u see when u wake up', just days after she was threatened with rape by a different online abuser. The latest shamed Twitter user, sent an image from the horror film Halloween, and has been reported to the police and suspended by Twitter. Ms Creasy retweeted the disgusting message as an example of what trolls have threatened her with, all because she had successfully campaigned for Jane Austen to appear on the new £10 note. Two arrests have already been made in relation to those threats. Ms Beard, a professor of classics at University of Cambridge, last night contacted police after receiving a message claiming a bomb had been left outside her home. Speaking to BBC Breakfast today, she said: 'I've had lots of abuse, but only recently have I had these things actually threatening violence rape and death. 'I think we've got to be quite careful about drawing a distinction between those things because abuse is very nasty, it's sexist, it's misogynist.' Ms Beard said that although Twitter had been 'slow off the mark' to address the issue, she was happy with the support she received from the site in the last 24 hours. Scotland Yard said it has launched an investigation into eight allegations of online abuse and threats. Brave: Hannah had tried to stand up on trolls who were intent on trying to bully her . Less than two weeks before her death, a desperate Hannah Smith begged her tormentors to stop their cruelty and even bravely stood up to them. On July 20 a troll taunted her: 'u ugly f*** go die evry1 wuld be happy.' Hannah replied: 'yes i may be ugly, but you obviously have an ugly personality to tell people to 'go die'! oh and btw i think you may need a dictionary love:*' Days earlier on July 7 another abuser posted: 'Die due (sic) die due (sic) die due (sic).' The day before, she received another chilling message which read: 'go (sic) die u pathetic emo.' On July 5 a troll called her a 'fat self harmin' c***' while another wrote 'do us all a favour n kill ur self'. Another message read: 'go comit (corr) suicide but sued (sic) pls.' Hannah replied: 'wouldn't you fell bad if i did ey?' On the same day as the torrent of abuse, Hannah pleaded: 'omg can you just f*** off who ever this is.' On May 5 Hannah was again targeted when a sick troll wrote: 'Ur uncle deserved cancer and die.' In desperation, brave Hannah replied: 'My uncle had cancer and yes he sadly passed away and I do miss him, he was an amazing man and he certainly didn't deserve cancer, so if I was you I would either come say it my face or come off anon so I know who it is.' On the same day Hannah was even tormented about her family who the troll appeared to know. The troll wrote: 'Would be better if ur mum actualy killed u hahaha.' A month earlier on April 5 Hannah was taunted because of her appearance. The troll wrote: 'well you are a s***, have you seen yourself, ever heard of how to apply your makeup properly, you look about 10.' Another user wrote: 'U should commit suicide. no1 would care if ya died u cretin' A clearly distressed Hannah replied: 'wow, well for your information I've tried commiting suicide before, and yes I know I'm ugly no need to tell me :( and getting things like this from people that like to hide behind there computer screen doesn't make me feel any better then me! 'How would you feel if I did commit suicide because of this?

"Mike Ashley has backed Alan Pardew after clear-the-air talks with the Newcastle manager over his future. The club’s owner has told Pardew he doesn’t want to judge his four year spell at St James’ Park in the opening four games of the season in the Barclays Premier League. Pardew is under massive pressure from Newcastle supporters after their disappointing start to the season left them bottom of the table with just two points. Mike Ashley, Newcastle United's owner, watches on as his side are humiliated 4-0 at St Mary's Stadium . Alan Pardew (right) is under pressure as Newcastle United manager following 4-0 defeat at Southampton . Newcastle United fans unveiled a banner saying 'Pardew Out' in the away end at St Mary's  on Saturday . They lost 4-0 at Southampton on Saturday and Pardew knows he will walk into a hostile environment when they place Hull at St James’ Park on Saturday. Despite the negativity at St James’ Park, Newcastle are only three points behind Manchester United in ninth place and Everton in 10th. Ashley was at St Mary’s to watch his team surrender against Saints, but he is holding his nerve despite the demands from Newcastle fans to fire the manager. They are bottom of the Premier League table after four games, but Pardew has no intention of walking away from the club. On Saturday his assistant John Carver was allegedly involved in a heated exchange with Newcastle fans when they demanded Pardew’s dismissal. A banner was unfurled with the words ‘Pardew is a muppet’ during the game and he was subjected to more unfavourable chants throughout their disappointing performance. Although Pardew signed an eight year contract with the club in September 2012, there is a break clause in the deal if Ashley decides to sack his boss.

Newcastle United fans also held a banner saying 'Pardew is a muppet' during the 4-0 defeat at St Mary's .

Ashley would have pay a fixed fee in compensation - around £5million - to sack Pardew, but he vowed to support his manager during talks over the past 48 hours. The total bill to fire Pardew and bring in another manager, such as Steve Bruce or former Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis, would cost around £8m. In addition to the costs involved in sacking Pardew, the Newcastle owner would have to pay compensation to Hull if he wanted to appointed Bruce. Although Pulis is no longer with Palace, he is still under contract with the south London club and and a compensation figure of around £3m is in existence.

"Justin Bieber has caused outrage after leaving a 'tasteless' comment in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. The 19-year-old singer - who is currently on tour in Europe - visited the famous home where Jewish wartime diarist Frank and her family hid from Nazi persecution for two years during the Holocaust. After spending an hour touring the home on Saturday, which opened as a museum in 1960, Bieber wrote a message in the guestbook, which read: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. 'Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.' Scroll down for video . Sharp exit: Justin Bieber leaving the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam on Saturday after writing a comment that has Facebook and Twitter fans outraged . The Anne Frank House staff-run Facebook page shared the singer's comments. But since the the museum updated its page with Justin's words, the Facebook post has garnered hundreds of comments expressing dismay over the young pop sensation's presumptuous remarks. Many described it as 'disrespectful,' 'disgusting' and an 'embarrassment to Canadians.' Belieber battle: Hundreds of people left comments on the Anne Frank House's update about Justin that expressed disgust . From Justin to Anne: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.' Hundreds of people took to Twitter to express outrage, branding the singer a 'moron' and 'douche,' leaving several to question whether he actually wrote such a shocking message. Buzzfeed reports that BBC reporter Anna Holligan received confirmation from the Anne Frank House press office. The press office commented: 'He was very interested in Anne Frank.' Handling the situation with grace, . they said of his odd note: 'He's 19, it's a strange life he's living, it . wasn't very sensible but he didn't mean bad.' People on Twitter seems to disagree, some even saying it's time to take Bieber to rehab. One person even tweeted: 'When life gets done with Justin Bieber, I have a feeling it isn't going to be pretty.' Another wrote in regards to Justin's note in the guestbook: 'I weep for humanity.' Further driving the point home, an additional shocked Twitter commenter said: 'He has no right to say this.' Anne Frank wrote her now-famous diary while residing in the house, with the teenager describing it as luxurious compared to other hiding places she had heard about. The Frank family moved to Amsterdam from German in 1933 - the same year the Nazis gained control over Germany. By 1940 the Nazi had occupied the Netherlands, leaving the family trapped in Amsterdam. Not . happy: People took to Twitter to express their dismay over the pop . star's disrespectful comment in the Anne Frank House guestbook .

"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has confirmed Senegal midfielder Sadio Mane has been successful in obtaining a work permit and will join up with his team-mates on Friday. Mane is still awaiting his Saints debut after joining the club from Red Bull Salzburg in an £11.8million deal, but will not feature against Swansea on Saturday. Koeman said: 'Yesterday I got the message everything is done. The work permission is okay. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed that Sadio Mane (pictured) has obtained a work permit . Mane joined Southampton in a £11.8m deal from Red Bull Salzburg this summer . 'He is flying back today and he will arrive tomorrow. It's too close for Saturday.' Koeman will assess 22-year-old Mane's physical state before determining if the winger can feature against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup next Tuesday night. 'The last 10 days I don't know what he did,' Koeman added. 'It will be a good chance for him to be part of the squad for next Tuesday, for the League Cup game against Arsenal.' Mane will train with his Southampton team-mates on Friday but will not feature against Swansea this weekend . Saints have no injury concerns after striker Shane Long overcame a head injury. 'Shane Long is okay,' Koeman added. 'He's (been) doing training sessions for three days. He's no problem for this Saturday. No injuries. Only the case of Mane.' Mane's transfer is the sort which may not occur if the Football Association succeeds in tightening rules over non-European Union imports. Koeman also confirmed that Shane Long (centre) is available for selection on Saturday against Swansea . Koeman, though, defended Southampton's impressive record of nurturing native English talent. 'I'm positive to try in the country to do the maximum for the English players,' the Dutchman added. 'I think we do that in Southampton. If you look at the team, our squad, it's a lot of English players, a lot of young players, maybe it's more and more than the rest of the clubs.'","Ronald Koeman has confirmed Sadio Mane has obtained a work permit .

"Celtic captain Scott Brown has told his team-mates there are 'no excuses' now the transition period is over. Brown made his first appearance of the season in Celtic's 2-1 Scottish Premiership win over Aberdeen on Saturday after a torn hamstring ruled him out of Ronny Deila's difficult start as manager. The victory over the Dons was Celtic's first in five games and supporters are still reeling from their failure to qualify for the Champions League against Maribor despite an initial reprieve following an administrative error by Legia Warsaw. Celtic captain Scott Brown has told his team-mates there are 'no excuses' now the transition period is over . But Celtic can give Deila a much-needed boost if they get their Europa League campaign off to a winning start when they take on Salzburg in Austria on Thursday. Brown, who was speaking to promote BT Sport's exclusively live coverage of the game, said: 'It's always hard when a new manager comes in and has three weeks before his first Champions League qualifier. 'Ever since then, I have seen glimpses of how we are going to play and we are getting better and better every game. 'Now we have to put it into 90 minutes and not just 60 or 70. 'You have to have faith in him. Everyone sees the good football we are trying to play. It's all going to come together as soon as possible and hopefully that will be Thursday. Manager Ronny Deila has endured a difficult start at Celtic and failed to make it into the Champions League . 'It's just been getting used to the new shape and new players. Now the transfer window is closed, that's our squad settled. We've got no excuses now. 'We have to try and push on and start playing the football we know we can play. We did really well against Aberdeen and those three points were a boost.' Brown believes the Europa League campaign - where they will also face Dinamo Zagreb and Romanians Astra Giurgiu - has the potential to define Celtic's season. Celtic reached the UEFA Cup final in 2003 after a surprise Champions League qualifying defeat by Basle earlier in the season. The Scotland midfielder said: 'We are still disappointed that we didn't get into the Champions League. Celtic's season took an up-turn after beating Aberdeen 2-1 in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday . 'We have to go out there and show we are a good team and we can play against these teams home and away. 'When you saw the sights, there were over 200,000 Celtic fans in Seville, they were saying. It would be great to do that again but we're not going to get too far ahead of ourselves, we have to take it game by game and see how we do. 'Seville was a huge day for the club and we'd love to bring memories like that back again but we have to take it one game at a time and do as well as we can in the group. 'We've got a big squad now, new wingers and a couple of new strikers. They are looking good in training so hopefully they can take that into games.'

"Manchester United winger Antonio Valencia has been ordered by manager Louis van Gaal to take English lessons – despite having lived here for eight years. Van Gaal is determined his current squad, which includes a number of native Spanish-speakers, should all become fluent in English to help communication on the training ground and the pitch. Newcomers Angel Di Maria, Marcos Rojo, Radamel Falcao and Ander Herrera have all had twice-weekly lessons arranged for them alongside goalkeeper David de Gea, who is in his fourth season at the club, and Valencia, who first arrived in the Premier League to play for Wigan Athletic in 2006 before signing for United three seasons later. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal praise Radamel Falcao's English in press conference . Antonio Valencia has been told to have English lessons by new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal . Antonio Valencia first arrived in England eight years ago when he signed for Wigan in 2006 . Juan Mata, Anderson, Ander Herrera, David de Gea, Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo all speak Spanish . Louis van Gaal wants his players speaking in English around Manchester United's training complex . Di Maria and Rojo, who arrived this summer for a combined price of £75milion, barely speak a word of English and will take beginners’ classes together. It is expected that Falcao, who spoke broken English at his formal press conference unveiling on Thursday, and Herrera will be promoted to join de Gea in intermediate classes over the coming weeks. Valencia has asked for one-to-one tuition. It is ironic that Dutchman Van Gaal is taking a tougher attitude over United players adapting to life in England than either of his British predecessors Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes. Louis van Gaal (right) wants his Spanish speaking players, such as Radamel Falcao, to speak English . Juan Mata's English is judged good enough to not need lessons but Angel di Maria (right) will have lessons . Valencia is by nature a shy person and has never conducted an interview in English despite coming to the country at the age of 20. He has played 282 times for Wigan and United. Spanish international Juan Mata, who joined Chelsea in the same 2011 summer transfer window as De Gea came to England, has been judged to speak English well enough not to need additional lessons. The instruction for De Gea to brush up on his language skills is significant. The £18m Spaniard has improved greatly from a shaky start to his career at Old Trafford but communication in the United defence has never been as strong with him in goal as it was during the eras of Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. Van Gaal’s move is sure to be welcomed by some United fans who are worried that the club are losing their traditional identity after spending £150m on new, predominantly foreign players this summer while letting academy graduates Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley leave.","Manchester United manager wants all his players speaking in English .

"U.S. special forces failed in an attempt to free the British hostage who ISIS militants have threatened to kill, it has emerged. Jihadist militants released a second sickening video on Tuesday which showed U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff being beheaded by a fighter with an English accent. At the end of the video, a British hostage is filmed on his knees in a similar orange jumpsuit to those worn by the two men already killed by the extremist group, sparking fears he could be their next victim. U.S. journalist Steven Sotloff (pictured) was the latest victim of ISIS jihadists and a video of his killing included footage of a British hostage, who it is feared could become the fanatics' next victim . It is believed the British hostage, who is not being named by UK media, and James Foley (pictured), who was the first man killed in the videos, were the subject of a failed  rescue mission earlier this summer . It has now come to light that the man - who MailOnline is not identifying him at the request of the British government but who has been named and pictured around the world - was the subject of a failed rescue attempt by U.S. commandos earlier this summer. Last month the Pentagon revealed it had launched the attempt to rescue a number of hostages held in Syria, including James Foley, the journalist killed in the first video. But the mission failed to bring back any hostages because the jihadist gang had moved prior to American commandos' arrival. The British hostage is believed to be an aid worker who was based on the Turkish border of Syria, working with victims of war. Government sources have stressed that Britain has a long-standing principle not to publicize kidnappers or terrorists. But UK authorities are in touch with the man's family and are continuing to provide support for them, it is understood. It comes as President Barack Obama has said that America will not be intimidated by the 'horrific' violence of the Islamic State following the brutal execution of Mr Sotloff. David Cameron, who will meet NATO leaders in Wales later this week, has branded the latest video 'absolutely disgusting and despicable' Journalists Mr Sotloff (left) and Mr Foley (right) had been covering the war in Syria when they were kidnapped . Speaking in Tallinn, Estonia, Mr Obama vowed that 'justice will be served' and that a coalition will be built to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS, which has taken control of vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. However, failed to give a timeline for deciding on a strategy to attack the terror group's operations, saying: 'It'll take time to roll them back'. Mr Obama spoke at a news conference with President Toomas Hendrik Ilves after arriving in Estonia to show solidarity with Baltic leaders who fear they could be the next target of Russia's aggression. During the conference, he added that the prayers of the American people are with the family of the 'devoted and courageous journalist' Mr Sotloff, who deeply loved the Islamic world and whose 'life stood in stark contrast to those who murdered him so brutally.' Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement that he would chair an emergency response meeting with his Cabinet on Wednesday to review the latest developments. Mr Cameron has hit out at the ‘absolutely disgusting, despicable’ murder of Mr Sotloff. He said: 'If verified, this is a despicable and barbaric murder. My thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sotloff’s family and friends tonight as they deal with this appalling and tragic situation. Steven Sotloff's mother Shirley had appealed directly for the return of her son last week . Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished in Syria in August 2013 and was not seen again until he appeared in a video released last month that showed Foley's beheading. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the U.S. stopped airstrikes on the Islamic State. In the video distributed on Tuesday and titled 'A Second Message to America,' Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the Islamic State, the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq and declared itself a caliphate. The executioner appears to be the same man who killed Foley – known as ‘Jihadi John’ - and tells the camera: 'I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State.' He warned President Obama that as long as U.S. airstrikes against the militant group continue, 'our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people.' 'Justice will be served': President Barack Obama (pictured) today said that America would not be intimidated by the 'horrific' violence of the Islamic State after a second U.S. journalist was brutally beheaded on video . Speech: Speaking in Tallinn, Estonia, Mr Obama vowed that 'justice will be served' after the video was verified . Visit: Mr Obama (left) spoke at a news conference with President Toomas Hendrik Ilves (right) after arriving in Estonia to show solidarity with Baltic leaders who fear they could be the next target of Russia's aggression . The footage - depicting what the U.S. called a sickening act of brutality - was posted two weeks after the release of video showing the killing of James Foley and just days after Sotloff's mother pleaded for his life. Barak Barfi, a spokesman for the family said: 'The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately. There will be no public comment from the family during this difficult time,' Barfi said. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Wednesday that the world was 'outraged' at what they had seen. 'We are all outraged at reports from Iraq about the brutal killing of civilians by ISIL, including yesterday's (Tuesdays) reported brutal beheading of another journalist,' he said. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said U.S. intelligence analysts will work as quickly as possible to determine if the video is authentic. He said it is believed that 'a few' Americans are still being held by the ISIS. Psaki would not give any specifics, but one is a 26-year-old woman kidnapped while doing humanitarian aid work in Syria, according to a family representative who asked that the hostage not be identified out of fear for her safety. No statement: President Obama boarded Air Force One to Estonia yesterday without addressing the nation . The fighter who apparently beheads Sotloff in the video calls it retribution for Obama's continued airstrikes against the group. The killer specifically mentions the recent U.S. airstrikes around the Mosul dam and the beleaguered Iraqi town of Amirli, making it unlikely that Sotloff was killed at the same time as Foley, as some analysts had speculated. Over the weekend, Iraqi government forces with help from U.S. airstrikes broke the Islamic State's two-month siege of Amirli, a town where some 15,000 Shiite Turkmens had been stranded. In a statement on Tuesday evening from U.S. Central Command, military officials said an airstrike conducted on Monday against Islamic State militants near the Mosul Dam damaged or destroyed 16 armed vehicles. The SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, first reported the video's existence. In a sign of disorganization - or perhaps dissension - in the extremist group's ranks, a faction of the Islamic State apparently posted the video early, before it was supposed to be released. In a later Twitter message, those responsible apologized and asked fellow jihadis not to 'reproach' them. Alleged: The British jihadist, Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known as Jihadi John is suspected of killing US journalist James Foley and Steven Sotloff (pictured above on August 19) The Islamic State has terrorized rivals and civilians alike with widely publicized brutality as it seeks to expand a proto-state it has carved out on both sides of the border. In its rise to prominence over the past year, it has frequently published graphic photos and gruesome videos of bombings, beheadings and mass killings. Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded with his captors for mercy, saying in a video that her son was 'an innocent journalist' and 'an honorable man' who 'has always tried to help the weak.' Sotloff grew up in the Miami area, and graduated from Kimball Union Academy, a prep school in New Hampshire. As a student at Kimball, Sotloff 'developed a passion for reporting and writing, a gift that he shared with people around the world, and this unthinkable act of terror has taken him from us far too soon,' New Hampshire Gov, Maggie Hassan said in a statement. Sotloff then attended the University of Central Florida, which said he majored in journalism from 2002 to 2004 but apparently left without graduating. Just how Sotloff made his way from Florida to Middle East hotspots is not clear. He published articles from Syria, Egypt and Libya in a variety of publications. Several focus on the plight of ordinary people in war-torn places. A friend puts a consoling arm around Steven Sotloff's father Art on the day that he found out his son had been brutally executed by ISIS militants in Syria . In a statement, Foreign Policy magazine said it was saddened by news of his death and called him a 'brave and talented journalist' whose reporting 'showed a deep concern for the civilians caught in the middle of a brutal war.' Time Editor Nancy Gibbs said Sotloff 'gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world.' House Foreign Affairs Chairman Rep. Ed Royce, a California Republican, said the new video demonstrates the Islamic State's 'barbarity across the region - beheading and crucifying those who don't share their ideology.' He said the U.S. and allies need to step up military action against the group, including through airstrikes. At Sotloff's parents' home in Pinecrest, Florida, two police vehicles blocked the driveway Tuesday, and officers advised journalists to stay away. Friends of the family could be seen coming and going. 'Everyone's been concerned. Everyone is grieving,' neighbor Pepe Cazas said. 'It's terrible. I've been praying for him.'","British hostage paraded before camera in latest ISIS beheading video .

Eugene Kapustina, 61, says she was told to look after the boy while his parents left to find work in another town, but they have been gone for a year without contacting her . Speaking to police, she said that all her savings have been used up trying to pay for herself and the child and added that she can no longer afford to feed him on her pension. She told officers she hoped that somebody at the supermarket in the suburb of Zelenograd, in the Russian capital Moscow, might take care of him. Investigators managed to trace the woman using CCTV footage and information from the boy. Footage shows the distressed child sitting on the floor by the cash desks where he was approached by the security guard Ahmed Izmaylov after he noticed that the child seemed to be unaccompanied. He said: 'I approached him and he started to cry and saw that he had a small bag with a few possessions and a note saying please look after me.' The boy has been placed in a temporary orphanage and police say he will stay there until they can find his parents. Once they have interviewed them, a decision can be made on the child's future. Kapustina says she has spent all of her money taking care of the boy and cannot feed him any longer. She says she left him in the supermarket in the hopes that someone would look after him .

"After an assist and a goal for Spain against Macedonia on Monday night, 21-year-old Paco Alcacer stepped up in the absence of the injured Diego Costa as La Roja recovered from a poor 2014 World Cup. Here, Sportsmail finds out more about the young Valencia frontman who has been quietly making a name for himself at the Mestella. So who is Spain’s new striking sensation? He’s Paco Alcacer, Valencia’s 21-year-old striker – one start, one assist and one goal are his international stats so far. Talent: Paco Alcacer (left) celebrates his goal with David Silva during Spain's 5-1 win against Macedonia . Name sounds familiar? Top European clubs have been looking at Alcacer since 2010 when he top scored in the Under-17 Euros with six goals for Spain. He was free-scoring 16-year-old in Valencia’s youth academy at the time. He got 14 goals in total in that tournament including qualifying. Arsenal took a very close look towards the end of last season but Valencia – a selling club for so long but now under new ownership wanted to hang on to him. Was his step up to the Spain first team predicted? He got three goals for the Under-19s when they won the Euros in Rumania in 2011, scoring twice in the final against the Czech Republic and a year later he repeated the feat scoring this time in the semi-final against France. Spain love promoting their Under-21s so with Villa retired and neither Negredo or Torres in the sort of form to earn them a recall his chance has come. New boy: Alcacer (right) could soon find himself in Spain's starting line-up more often . Thank you: Alcacer points to the sky in celebration after volleying Spain into a 2-0 lead . But he has Diego Costa ahead of him still? In theory yes. Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque has made Costa his own personal project after persuading him to switch from Brazil to Spain. But many see Alcacer’s style as better suited to Spain’s short passing game. But he is not in Costa’s league? We’ll he’s not even in the Champions League. He was farmed out to Getafe on loan in 2012 and he scored just four goals but still showed enough promise to be recalled and pushed up to the first team at Valencia last season. He repaid that faith with 14 goals and now he is the main man at Mestalla. He is not at Costa’s level but he is young and having come through the Spanish national youth system he fits perfectly in the senior side – unlike Costa who by his own admission is still adapting. Filling in: Alcacer could take advantage of Diego Costa's stuttering start to life in a Spain shirt . International: Costa has struggled to find form for Spain despite a scoring start to life at Chelsea . What are his key strengths? He is a finisher first and foremost. Quick, strong and clever enough to get in front defenders and get on the end of crosses in the six-yard box. Likes to finish with a first touch as he did to get the winner against Barcelona at the Camp Nou last season but also has the quick feet to make room for himself in the penalty area. And he’s a No 9? He’s technically good with the touch to play with his back to goal and hold the ball up for midfielders but he can also play in wider areas and for Spain against Macedonia he spent a lot of time running the left channel leaving David Silva to appear through the middle. Could he still finish up in the Premier League? His current contract runs out in 2016 and his buy out clause is set at £16million. Another good season and there will be plenty of takers at that price. Star striker: The 21-year-old is now the main man at Valencia and is contracted until 2016 .","Paco Alcacer scored during Spain's 5-1 win against Macedonia .

"Brendan Rodgers has rubbished claims by West Ham United boss Sam Allardyce that Liverpool succumbed to defeat to Aston Villa due to complacency by insisting the Reds are 'allergic' to such a thing. The Anfielders surprisingly fell to a 1-0 home loss against Villa last weekend and Hammers manager Allardyce suggested Liverpool had taken their opponents lightly because they were instead focusing on facing Ludogorets in the Champions League in mid-week.

"Ronny Deila insisted on Wednesday that Aleksandar Tonev did not make the racist comments attributed to him by Aberdeen’s Shay Logan - and said the Celtic winger was not ‘wasting any energy’ over the matter. But the Parkhead manager’s unequivocal backing for his player seems certain to anger the Dons as the SFA are still carrying out their investigation into the controversy. Defender Logan alleged that Bulgarian Tonev called him a ‘black c***’ during Celtic’s 2-1 Premiership win at Parkhead last Saturday. Referee Bobby Madden included the claims in his match report and Logan, Pittodrie boss Derek McInnes and Tonev himself are being interviewed by the governing body. Ronny Deila has defended Aleksandar Tonev amid allegations the Celtic player racially abused Shay Logan during the win over Aberdeen on Saturday . Tonev is accused of calling Aberdeen's Logan a 'black c***' during the Premiership match at Parkhead . It’s understood that Sky’s cameras failed to pick up any evidence of abuse and Tonev, on a one-year loan from Aston Villa, vehemently denies the claims. As the player flew to Salzburg in Austria with Celtic for Thursday night's Europa League clash, his version of events were emphatically backed by Deila. ‘That has been no trouble for him,’ said the Norwegian. ‘We made a statement and I trust my players. I know he didn’t do it. ‘He is an honest player and I believe in what he is saying. He has not wasted any energy on that at all. He seems very comfortable. We are in a good mood with the whole squad and it is nothing we have used energy on.’ Logan has declined making a complaint to police, but Parkhead striker Leigh Griffiths is currently the subject of a report to the Procurator Fiscal after he was filmed joining in allegedly racist chants before a Hearts-Hibs clash earlier this year. Tonev carries the ball forward for Celtic as Logan (right) gives chase during Saturday's match . Celtic train on the eve of their Europa League clash with Salzburg at the Red Bull Arena . Celtic were paired with Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Zagreb and Astra Giurglu in their Europa League group . Asked if he had felt compelled to remind players of their responsibilities under the club’s code of conduct, Deila added: ‘We haven’t talked about it because it hasn’t been an issue. Everybody knows we don’t want to be associated with those words. I trust my players and he hasn’t said it. 'Aleksandar needs games. He hasn’t played for a long, long time and that’s the problem with a lot of the players we have. They have been in and out for a while. But he is mentally good.’ Deila is missing Charlie Mulgrew, Adam Matthews and Mikael Lustig for tonight’s clash with under-pressure Salzburg, but is able to call on Ghanaian loan signing Wakaso Mubarak for the first time. ‘He was training this week and looks good,’ said the Celtic boss. ‘He is a quick player, a hard working player so we’re looking forward to seeing him in the match. Tonev on the ball during Wednesday evening's training session in Austria . Ronny Delia (right) and his assistant John Collins keep a close eye on the training session . ‘Could he make an impact for us? Sure, he could do that. Again, he hasn’t played many matches in a while but we have a lot of games coming up so we need everyone in the squad.’ Deila believes points away from home will be the key to success in Group D. Salzburg have lost three games on the trot, but assistant coach Zsolt Low travelled to Glasgow to watch Celtic in action on Saturday. And coach Adi Hutter said: ‘We have carefully analysed the video of Celtic’s 2-1 win over Aberdeen. ‘They have an experienced squad of international calibre. They are very strong. Goalkeeper Craig Gordon makes a save during Celtic's practice session ahead of Thursday's match . Captain Scott Brown sets the pace during the session at the Red Bull Arena . ‘Kris Commons and Scott Brown are their key players in midfield. However, I also admire Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer. ‘Getting an early goal will be vital. That could solve a lot of problems. ‘It is important that we attack Celtic from the very first minute. ‘We have to press offensively against Celtic. They are very sturdy and strong in the tackle.

"Gareth Breese enjoyed a fairytale finish to his cricket career as Durham won the Royal London One-Day Cup after beating Warwickshire by three wickets in a nail-biting final at Lord's. Breese was playing his final game for Durham before retiring and the 38-year-old took three wickets, two catches and scored an unbeaten 15, including the winning runs that secured the trophy. Durham looked to be in a commanding position when they bowled their opponents out for 165 but Warwickshire came back strong as off-spinner Jeetan Patel took four for 25.

Breese and Mark Stoneman with the trophy on the Lord's outfield . Durham's champagne moment with the trophy after their victory . VIDEO Ben Stokes applauds Durham performance . It was Durham though who held their nerve as Mark Stoneman made 52 before Ben Stokes (38no) and Breese steered their side to victory in only the club's second ever Lord's final. The toss was always likely to prove a major factor on a damp and overcast morning in north London but Durham, having elected to field, exploited the conditions to the full. Rushworth (two for 24), fresh from his club-record 15-wicket haul against Northamptonshire, made the early breakthrough, as William Porterfield (nine) was caught behind by Phil Mustard. Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott came to the crease at 16 for one but the second leading run-scorer in the competition was dismissed cheaply, snared lbw by Collingwood (two for 36) for two. Collingwood spilled a straightforward catch after Tim Ambrose mistimed a cut off Stokes (two for 25) but three wickets in three overs put Durham in the driving seat. Ambrose (11) was first to fall, edging into the hands of Breese, and six balls later, Laurie Evans was out for a duck, looping Stokes' short ball into gully where Breese again took the catch. Durham captain Paul Collingwood celebrates taking the key wicket of Jonathan Trott . Breese is overjoyed after taking the wicket of Warwickshire and England all-rounder Chris Woakes . Varun Chopra (right) top scored for Warwickshire with 64 and here he drives one through the covers . Jeetan Patel hits out as Warwickshire's lower order tries to make the total semi-respectable . Warwickshire's No 8 Ateeq Javid hits a six off the bowling of Paul Coughlin . Chopra salutes his hard-fought fifty . The chances kept coming as Rikki Clarke's edge was put down by Mustard but Stokes made sure soon after, clean bowling the right-hander for two to leave Warwickshire 68 for five. The batting side turned to the in-form Chris Woakes for inspiration and, together with Chopra, Warwickshire passed the 100 mark in the 30th over. Chopra made his fifty soon after but just as Durham's momentum looked to be fading, Woakes was caught brilliantly by the back-pedalling Calum MacLeod for 23. With Woakes gone, the onus fell on Chopra to carry the innings but the Warwickshire captain's stubborn resistance ended when he was bowled by Rushworth for 64. Patel (14), Oliver Hannon-Dalby (six) and Boyd Rankin (one) were dispatched quickly to leave just Ateeq Javid (22) unbeaten after 47 overs and Durham chasing 166 to win. Warwickshire needed a fast start to have any hope of victory and they got it as Clarke (two for 20) bowled Mustard for a duck in the fourth ball of the innings. Optimism then turned to belief as Clarke claimed his second wicket in the third over, luring MacLeod (nought) into an edge which was caught by Chopra. At 12 for two, Warwickshire's tails were up but Durham continued to attack their opponents' meagre total with some aggressive batting. Woakes (none for 50) was particularly expensive, as Mark Stoneman smashed a series of boundaries to wrestle back the initiative and push his team past 50. It was then that Patel came into the Warwickshire attack and the spinner struck in his first over, trapping Keaton Jennings (eight) lbw to make it 60 for three after 13 overs. Stoneman passed 50 in 43 balls but Patel was soon celebrating again as he removed both Stoneman and then Scott Borthwick (12) lbw. Tim Ambrose (left) tries to stump Durham's No 4 batsman Keaton Jennings . Ambrose (left), Rikki Clarke (second left) and Chopra (right) appeal in vain for the wicket of Stokes . Durham's nerves were jangling but Collingwood imposed some much-needed stability on the innings, guiding his side past the 100-mark alongside Stokes. Just as Warwickshire looked to be running out of ideas, Collingwood was caught on 21 off Hannon-Dalby (one for 22) to keep the contest alive at 118 for six. Stokes kept the runs ticking over but Warwickshire - and Patel - refused to lie down as the New Zealander claimed his fourth lbw victim in Gordon Muchall (nine). Stokes was fortunate not to pay the price for an audacious reverse-sweep but as the ball whistled past the stumps, Durham's crown finally looked assured as Breese hit the winning runs to spark celebrations.","Gareth Breese hit winning runs for Durham against Warwickshire .

"Mysterious ‘blobs’ in cells have eluded scientists’ understanding since they were first discovered 50 years ago. Now, US experts have called on the scientific community to up their efforts in determining their function, as the ‘blobs’ could play a key role in diseases such as cancer. The strange cloudy structures, known as ‘assemblages’, consist of shifting collections of proteins. Despite their existence being known since the invention of the electron microscope half a century ago, scientists still have no idea why they are there. The search is on: US experts have called on the scientific community (illustrated with a stock image) to up their efforts in determining the function of mysterious cellular proteins known as ‘blobs’ Two American experts are now calling on colleagues around the world to step up research on the 'blobs' in the hope of opening up new avenues for treating disease. Professor Jeffrey Toretsky, from Georgetown University in Washington DC, said: ‘I want to know what these assemblages are doing in Ewing sarcoma, the disease I concentrate on - and I would think all other researchers who study human biology would want to know their functions in both health and disease.’ Together with Professor Peter Wright, from The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, he compiled an overview of what is known about assemblages and published it in the Journal of Cell biology. The ‘blobs’ are often - but not always - made up of intrinsically disordered proteins, they wrote. Unlike most proteins, they do not assume a specific shape that fits certain other molecules, a bit like a lock and key. The scientists are calling on colleagues around the world to step up research on the blobs in the hope of opening up new avenues for treating disease, such as cancer (illustrated) 'Blobs' can be found in animal cells. They are described as strange cloudy clusters known as 'assemblages,' which consist of shifting collections of proteins. Unlike most proteins, they do not assume a specific shape that fits certain other molecules, a bit like a lock and key. Scientists are unsure of their function, despite studying them for 50 years. They seem to seek each other out and form gel-like structures. The ‘assemblages’ can trap and interact with other proteins and even RNA - a close relative of DNA that helps decode and regulate genes. This is why experts suspect that blobs could play a key role in diseases such as cancer. Molecular binding between lock-like ‘receptor’ proteins and key-like ‘ligands’ that fit them, drives a number of biological processes, including fundamental elements of the immune system. While the purpose of the ‘blob’ proteins is not clear, they are far from inert. In an apparently purposeful way, they seem to seek each other out and form gel-like structures. The resulting ‘assemblages’ can trap and interact with other proteins and even RNA - a close relative of DNA that helps decode and regulate genes. ‘It is only in the last five years that researchers have begun recognising that proteins without fixed structures may have important transitional properties that change based upon their local abundance in cells,’ Professor Toretsky explained. If the blobs play a role in disease, it might be possible to target them with a small-molecule drug, the scientists believe. Professor Toretsky said: ‘Current drug-discovery dogma suggests that it is very hard to make a small molecule to prevent two structured proteins from interacting. ‘However, small molecules have a greater likelihood of disrupting intrinsically disordered protein-protein interactions. ‘This review links together very basic biologic phenomena of protein interaction with the potential for new drug discovery. It’s an exciting challenge.’","US experts have reviewed everything that's known about 'blobs' in cells .

"Jamie Carragher has labelled Newcastle’s players a disgrace following their 4-0 defeat to Southampton while Gary Neville has described the Magpies squad as ‘letdowns’. Newcastle supporters have grown frustrated with manager Alan Pardew after the club’s disappointing start to the season but Carragher believes the players are to blame.

"Two Brooklyn men accused of crystal meth possession tasted victory on Tuesday after a settlement from the New York Police Department awarded them $33,000. The two plaintiffs sued the NYPD after they were arrested in Coney Island last year by officers claiming Jolly Ranchers in their possession were rocks of crystal meth. This was in spite of the fact they were leaving a candy store. Sweet: Two Brooklyn men received a settlement from the NYPD after a humiliating arrest for 'crystal meth' that was actually Jolly Ranchers . An undercover cop claimed he spotted Love Olatunjiojo, 26, and Omar Ferriera, 23, selling drugs in front of an IT'SUGAR candy store in Coney Island. Officers Jermaine Taylor and Jovanny Calderon moved in to make the arrest, conducting repeated searches of the two that turned up only Jolly Ranchers, saying it was, 'only a matter of time before they found something,’ according to the civil suit. The Daily News reports that when Jimmy Santos, 27, who was nearby with his 3-year-old daughter, came over to protest his friends' arrests, he was cuffed and 'punched in the face by an unidentified cop.' According to court documents, the officers performed field tests on pieces of Jolly Ranchers that came back positive for methamphetamine and the red and blue candies were taken into evidence. The city later told the plaintiffs' lawyer, Kenneth Smith, that no field test was conducted. The three men were held for 24 hours before an NYPD lab concluded that the Jolly Ranchers were in fact not crystal meth. Chrystal: Actual crystal meth has an appearance like broken glass or rocks, but color can be added to batches during production . In the lawsuit against the city, Olatunjiojo also claimed he was strip searched during his detainment. Smith says the city is not assigning blame to the cops, since there was no way to tell the hard candies were crystal meth. 'To my knowledge there is no evidence in the scientific literature that crystal meth looks like Jolly Ranchers or rock candy, other than from the 'Breaking Bad' show,' he told the Daily News.","Love Olatunjiojo, 26, and Omar Ferriera, 23, were in front of a candy store in Coney Island when an undercover cop says they were selling drugs .

"The father whose fateful decision to allow his 9-year-old daughter try out a powerful Uzi sub-machine gun led to her killing her instructor  is an investment fund manager, MailOnline can reveal. Alex Gen MacLachlan is an Ivy League-educated banker who manages a fund worth $1.5bn. He and his wife Alison have made no public comment on the tragedy beyond to say through their lawyer that they are 'devastated' by the accident at the Arizona firing range which killed instructor Charles Vacca. A female relative of MacLachlan living in New Jersey confirmed to MailOnline that Alex's daughter had been involved in the shooting. 'But I can't say anything about it,' she added. 'It's just terrible.' Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Alex MacLachlan, (left, pictured with his sister, Elizabeth) fired the gun first before letting his daughter take hold of the Uzi. MacLachlan is a fund manager with a firm in New Jersey and oversees $1.5bn . 'All right, full auto': MacLachlan's wife, Alison, filmed the moment their daughter shot dead instructor Charles Vacca and handed it over to police. The family said in a statement that they were praying for Vacca's family . He has not returned to work at Dixon's Global Resource Masters Fund since the August 25 accident. The family hasn't yet returned to their home in Weehawken, New Jersey just across the Hudson River from New York City either. A neighbor on the busy street where the MacLachlans live described the family as 'quiet and very nice,' adding 'it's all so terrible. That girl's just a baby.' MacLachlan, 43, is a high-flyer in the financial world. After graduating from Cornell University and getting a masters at Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, he spent most of his career in Australia where he also worked for UBS. It is believed his wife is Australian and that his daughter was born there before the family returned to the United States last year. Neighbours at the upscale Sydney suburb where they lived described them as a 'gorgeous, happy family', adding the couple had two other children, an older boy and a girl of high school age. MacLachlan has hired lawyer Kevin Walsh - who has been named as one of the 'Best Lawyers in America' since 2012 - to represent him. Walsh, a former federal prosecutor, did not return MailOnline's repeated calls. He earlier issued a statement saying the MacLachlan family was 'devastated', by the death of Vacca, 39, saying family members 'prayed day and night' that he would 'survive his injury'. Walsh said the MacLachlans 'continue to pray' for Vacca's family 'during this terribly difficult time'. Alex and Alison MacLachlan and their three children were vacationing in Las Vegas and took a 60-mile shuttle across the Arizona border to the Last Stop resort in White Hills for some weapon practice on August 25. They went for an early morning monster truck ride before going to Last Stop's Burgers and Bullets shooting range. According to Mohave County Sheriff's Department, Alex was first to fire the Mini Uzi 9mm before allowing his little girl to have a go. Video shows Vacca telling the pony-tailed girl, who was wearing a gray t-shirt, pink shorts and sneakers, how to shoot the gun. High flier: MacLachlan's profile on his firm's page. He graduated from Cornell University and got a Masters degree from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania . Past: The Maclachlans moved from this luxurious house in an upscale suburb of Sydney last year as Alex had spent a large portion of his career there. Neighbours said they were a 'happy, gorgeous' family . The cellphone video, taken by the girl's mother and released by the sheriff's department, shows the instructor, wearing sunglasses, a black t-shirt, camouflage pants and dark gloves, tapping the back of the girl's left knee to put her into a correct shooting stance. He then let her fire one shot as he braced her right elbow with his gloved right hand and placed his left hand in the small of her back. Vacca then turned the weapon on to automatic fire and that is when things went tragically wrong. He then says 'all right, full auto' and the video shows the slightly-built pre-teen lose control of the weapon which curls upward and to her left where her instructor is standing. The video cuts out before the shot to the head that kills Vacca. The girl's parents did not initially realize what had happened as they rushed to their daughter, who had dropped the gun complaining that the recoil had hurt her shoulder. Range workers went to the aid of Vacca, but nothing could be done to save him. A 911 call timed at 10.02 am recorded a fellow worker urging him: 'Breathe, breathe, breathe, Charlie. Breathe.' While another says 'I don't think he's gonna make it.' A 911 dispatcher asks a caller: 'Is he breathing?' The desperate man replies: 'Yes he is, he's having convulsions. You need to send EMS right away.' In a second 911 call a few minutes later, a man at the range asks the dispatcher: 'Where the f..k is the helicopter?' Vacca was eventually stabilized at the scene and airlifted by helicopter to University Medical Center in Las Vegas where he was pronounced dead soon after arrival. Authorities are not pressing charges in the death. According to police reports, Alex and Alison MacLachlan refused to allow investigators to interview their children because they were 'going through a lot'. Police at the scene were instructed to collect the waivers signed by the parents allowing the girl to shoot the Uzi but were told by range staff that they had 'blown away' after the shooting. The MacLachlans have not said whether they are considering a civil suit against the shooting range owners. Alex MacLachlan works for the US arm of Dixon Advisory, based in Sydney, Australia. His 10th floor office in Jersey City, New Jersey, has sweeping views of Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty across the Hudson River. Desperate: A 911 call recorded Vacca's  fellow worker urging him: 'Breathe, breathe, breathe, Charlie. Breathe' Investigation: Alex and Alison MacLachlan refused to allow investigators to interview their children because they were 'going through a lot', according to police reports . 'Alex conceived the idea of establishing a business to acquire and manage homes in urban areas experiencing strong growth and gentrification in 2008,' according to the website of his employers, Dixon USA. 'Between 2008 and 2010, Alex researched and developed the investment thesis and business model for what would become Dixon USA, and in late 2010, Dixon USA was launched. Today, Dixon USA manages a portfolio of over $300 million and is the only real estate investment trust focused on New York metropolitan area single-family homes.' A woman who answered the phone on Wednesday said MacLachlan had not been at work all week but referred other questions to MacLachlan's assistant, who refused to comment. According to the company's website, 'from funds under management of under $100 million at the time of his start, Alex has grown the Funds Management division to over $1.5 billion of funds under management today.' The Dixon website adds: 'In addition to his role as CEO of Funds Management, he now also leads the strategy and growth of Dixon USA, a leading provider of urban single-family home rentals in the New York metropolitan area. 'During his tenure in investment banking, Alex worked on more than $100 billion in mergers and acquisitions and capital markets transactions, advising some of the world’s leading companies,' the Dixon website says.","Ivy League-educated Alex MacLachlan, 43, of Weehawken, New Jersey, manages a fund worth $1.5bn .

"As a child growing up in North Carolina, Donald Morgan dreamed of joining the military and hoped one day to become a paratrooper and Special Forces soldier. But earlier this year the 44-year-old was arrested at JFK International Airport on his way home from Lebanon after trying and failing to join ISIS terrorists fighting in Syria. According to U.S. officials, Morgan spent eight months in the Middle East where he tried to sell military-grade guns and ammunition online. In an NBC interview, he openly admitted he wanted to join ISIS and said he would fight any enemies of Islam - be it the Syria's Bashar al-Assad or President Barack Obama. Scroll down for video . Donald Morgan, 44 (left), grew up as a Catholic in North Carolina, but after his dream of joining the military and serving in the police force fell through he converted to Islam and became radicalised . American mujaheddin: Donald Morgan, who now goes by Abu Omar Al-Amreeki, was arrested when he returned to the United States after trying to join ISIS in Syria . He also posted messages on Twitter under the name Abu Omar Al-Amreeki in which he pledged allegiance to the leader of ISIS, and told 'brothers' in Iraq that he was coming to join them. He wrote: 'Mujahid pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Islamic State commanding good and forbidding evil.' ISIS, which is now known as Islamic State, controls a large area of Iraq and has gained a reputation for appalling brutality after videos appeared of fighters performing mass executions and crucifixions. It is now responsible for the beheading of two U.S. journalists. The first, James Foley was killed last month, while the second, Steven Sotloff, was executed on Tuesday. So how did Morgan go from being a Catholic child with dreams of serving his country, to a radical Islamist hoping to help destroy it? Morgan . travelled to Lebanon earlier this year to be with his second wife, and . while there he tweeted about his loyalty to ISIS and tried to join the . group in Syria. He was arrested coming back to the U.S. in July . According to an interview with NBC, Morgan's journey began after he took part in a bootcamp which would have seen him deployed with the National Guard in Kuwait during Desert Storm. He failed to pass the grade, and with his childhood dream in tatters he turned instead to a career in law enforcement, becoming a sheriff's deputy. He said: 'My entire life growing up was surrounded by the idea that I would be 82nd Airborne, I would be Special Forces, I would serve dutifully – duty, honor and country. 'Later I thought that I would make this [law enforcement] my substitution for what I thought was going to be, in the beginning, a military career, an achievement, leadership.' But when he lost this job after a year and a half, Morgan began drinking heavily and partying. He got into several fights, before eventually being jailed for just over two years for firing a gun into a crowded restaurant. After being released Morgan attempted to turn his life around and took up bodybuilding, marrying fellow bodybuilder Tangela Horne in 1999 and having a son with her in 2001. However in 2008, a year after he and Tangela divorced, Morgan converted to Islam, and in 2012 friends began to notice that the religion was becoming all-encompassing. Morgan stopped going to the gym, grew his beard, shaved his head, opened an Islamic Center near to where he lived in Salisbury and began tweeting extremists views. Bryan Beaver, who had known Morgan for 15 years, said: 'His Facebook posts were a bit extreme at times. Derogatory statements toward Israel, some statements about infidels.' In his NBC interview. Morgan admits  that his views could be viewed as radical by Westerners, but said that he considers himself to be just a 'practicing Muslim'. He added that he was attracted to ISIS because he admired their devotion, and that fact that they put the worship of Islam above everything else. In January this year he went to Lebanon to visit his second wife, and spent months trying to move across the border into Syria 'to join the most beautiful brothers on earth'. However, it would seem his mission ultimately failed. It is not known why he returned to the U.S., but when he landed at J.F.K airport, he was arrested. A judge has ordered Morgan to be held without bail after Attorney Nadia Moore suggested Morgan was too dangerous to return to North Carolina on his own. Judge Ramon Reyes agreed, saying that tweets by Morgan implied he was 'trying to go to Syria or Iraq as the next step and trying to be actively engaged'.","Donald Morgan, 44, grew up as a Catholic and dreamed of joining the army .

"Alex Salmond today toasted a 'very encouraging' opinion poll which shows the gap between the Yes and No campaigns in the vote over Scottish independence has narrowed to just six points. Support for the Yes vote has surged following the First Minister's triumph in last week’s TV debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign. The YouGov survey for The Times and The Sun showed 48 per cent plan to vote No, 42 per cent back the Yes campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided. Scroll down for video . First Minister Alex Salmond, on a visit to the Eden Brewery in Guardbridge, near St Andrews in Fife, said the latest polls were 'very encouraging' Mr Salmond has been boosted by his victory in last week's TV debate against Better Together leader Alistair Darling . Excluding . Don’t Knows, No is on 53 percentage points compared to 47 percentage . points for Yes. Three weeks ago, the split was 61 points for No and 39 . for Yes. According to YouGov, undecided voters are twice as likely to vote for independence. The . surge will add to concerns that the momentum may be with the . independence campaign as the referendum approaches on 18 September. Speaking during a visit to Eden Brewery, just outside St Andrews, Fife, Mr Salmond said: 'I have always thought we would win. The polls are obviously very encouraging. 'But I am much more encouraged by the reaction on the streets. Dundee yesterday was extraordinary - it was a carnival atmosphere with certainly hundreds of people in the city centre. The Proclaimers have given a £10,000 donation to the Yes campaign, it emerged today. Twins Craig and Charlie Reid (above), who are well-known for hits . such as Letter To America and I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), gifted £10,000 to Yes . Scotland, new figures revealed. They said that as 'lifelong supporters of Scottish . independence' the cash gift was a 'matter of principle' for . them. They spoke after the Electoral Commission published its . latest figures on campaign donations ahead of the referendum on September 18. Yes Scotland raised £168,000 in donations between July . 25 and August 21 this year, with a further £10,000 being given to the . pro-independence Business for Scotland group. Designer Vivienne Westwood (right) claimed that an independent Scotland could be 'a model to us all'. The famed designer was inducted into the awards’ Hall Of Fame of the Scottish Fashion Awards for her contribution to the industry. Accepting the honour, Westwood, 73, said an independent Scotland could be 'a model to us all ... if it could become a people-friendly society'. 'People were queuing to register to vote. Yes, the polls are encouraging, but it is happening on the ground and in the streets and in communities.' Mr Salmond said Labour voters were moving to Yes because they do not like seeing their leaders 'in bed with the Tories', due to the Yes campaign's argument that the NHS will be better protected with independence and because of the 'positivity of the Yes campaign'. The Times reported that YouGov also found that some voters have changed sides. The . pro-independence vote among Labour supporters has risen from 18 . percentage points to 30 percentage points in a month. While the . proportion of Liberal Democrat voters supporting independence has also . increased – doubling to 24 points. SNP . ministers have been working hard to attract the centre-left vote – with . promises of more public spending in an independent Scotland. The proportion of women voting for independence has also increased, from 37 percentage points a month ago to 42 points. The . latest YouGov poll comes days after a Survation survey for the Daily . Mail found exactly the same result. It said the No campaign’s lead had . shrunk to six points, with 53 percentage points among decided voters . compared to 47 points for Yes. Last night . the president of YouGov, Peter Kellner, said: ‘Game on. YouGov’s latest . poll puts Alex Salmond within touching distance of victory. ‘Until . one month ago, the No campaign held a steady lead of at least 16 . points. When I first saw the results, I wanted to make sure this . movement was real. It is.’ Last . night Gordon Brown urged the Scots to reject independence if they want . to avoid massive NHS cuts. The former Prime Minister unveiled figures . which show that the Union lavishes far more on the healthcare of the . Scottish than it does on the English. He revealed that £176 a month was spent by the NHS per head of Scottish population – £17 more than the £159 per head in England. This . £1billion ‘NHS dividend’, Mr Brown said, would be under threat if the . Scots voted for independence, because the rest of the UK would no longer . be bearing the burden of the costs. The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18 . The Yes campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence, suggesting Alex Salmond has the momentum . Mr Brown . also warned that a breakaway Scotland would be an ‘international . outcast’ if Mr Salmond reneged on its share of the UK’s debt. He . unveiled his figures on healthcare spending in the first of a series of . rallies designed to target half a million undecided voters. He said the . Union delivered a million jobs, higher pensions, a lower cost of . living, a stable currency – and an ‘NHS dividend’ worth £1billion a . year. He . said: ‘With more elderly people, more people with disabilities and a . wider geographical area to cover, Scottish needs are, rightly, greater . and the share out of resources arises from a principle which is the . fairest there could be: you pay in across the UK based on your ability . to pay and you benefit based on your need.’ Better Together leader Alistair Darling yesterday launched a new ad van campaign with Leanne Williams and baby Charlotte near the Beacon Arts Centre in Greenock in Scotland . Gordon Brown said £176 a month was spent on healthcare per head of Scottish population – £17 more than the £159 people in England get . In his speech, Mr Brown highlighted academic research showing 962,000 Scottish jobs – more than 40 per cent – are linked directly or indirectly to the UK. The Better Together campaign unveiled controversial billboards with slogans such as: ‘I love my family. I’m saying No Thanks.’ Mr Darling said: ‘This poll is not a test of our Scottishness – it is a test of common sense.’","YouGov survey showed anti-independence lead down from 22 points .

"Arsene Wenger fears Olivier Giroud will be ruled out until the New Year, leaving Arsenal to consider a late plunge into the transfer market before Monday’s deadline. Wenger tried to push concerns aside to avoid distractions ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League play-off second leg against Besiktas but admitted Giroud could face a long time out after a freak injury. The striker was hurt when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot in the final seconds of Saturday’s 2-2 draw at Everton, pushing the toe-end of the foot upwards towards the shin, causing a small fracture near his ankle. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger refusing to rule out buying a striker . Crocked: Olivier Giroud (right) went down with an ankle injury late on against Everton on Saturday . Firepower: Giroud scored Arsenal's equaliser in the hard fought 2-2 draw with Everton on Saturday . VIDEO Giroud injury scare for Wenger . ‘I still don’t understand how he did it,’ said Arsenal manager Wenger. ‘The problem I think is his tibia. He over-stretched his ankle that way. It was on the ball, not a contact. ‘He has had a medical check but we need to have further investigation. The first news is not fantastic but I am not a doctor. So I wait for the complete examination and decision for how long he will be out.’ Giroud will be assessed again by a specialist on Wednesday but when asked if it looked like a long-term injury, Wenger replied: ‘It can be, we’ll see. It’s sad for us, but for the moment we are focused on this game. It is very important. We have started the season quite well, with three good games. We want to continue to grow and win our games.’ Arsenal are also without captain Mikel Arteta, who twisted an ankle in the goalless first leg and influential midfielder Aaron Ramsey, who is banned after a red card in Istanbul. Kieran Gibbs has a hamstring problem and Theo Walcott, out since January with a knee injury, will not be rushed back, with both set to return after next month’s international break. Lone man? Summer signing Alexis Sanchez is an option for Arsene Wenger up front against Besiktas . Option: Yaya Sanogo is a more natural forward, but there are still reservations over his consistency and ability . Transfer: Lukas Podolski seemed in high spirits despite speculation linking him with a move away . Arsenal’s poor injury record has been criticised in the past but Wenger said: ‘We do not have any muscular problems apart from Gibbs. Overall that is quite good compared to other clubs. The other injuries are Arteta with an ankle problem and Giroud. You cannot plan for an injury like his in the 94th minute.’ The prospect of five months out for Giroud forces Wenger to contemplate an emergency dip into the market, even though it is something which goes against the grain for the Arsenal boss. ‘In England as soon as you have a problem people want you to buy,’ said Wenger. ‘I can give you clubs with plenty of players who every time they lose say they have to buy more. But if you give the number of strikers we have it is unbelievable.’ Wenger can choose between Yaya Sanogo, Joel Campbell, Lukas Podolski and Alexis Sanchez to lead the line against Besiktas. Sanchez is the favourite, despite failing to impress at Goodsion Park. Like our dedicated Arsenal Facebook page. Stalemate: Arsenal were held to a 0-0 draw against Turkish side Besiktas in the first leg last week . ‘You do not convict a player on one half,’ said Wenger. ‘It was not all bad. There was some quality in what he did. I just felt, on the day, we needed some more physical presence.’ Arsenal are attempting to reach the group stages of the Champions League for the 17th successive year. They have won their last six of these play-off ties without ever seeming in danger. Defeat at this stage would cost the Londoners an estimated £25million and, despite healthy cash reserves, it would not help the club buy a top-quality replacement for Giroud. ‘It will affect us because we will have less income,’ said Wenger. ‘But it will not affect our balance sheet in a dramatic way. We can survive without that. We want to be in the Champions League, we want to play top-level football. ‘Financially we have always adapted. When we had very small resources, we adapted to very small resources. We want to play at the top.’ In charge: Arsene Wenger gathers his troops ahead of Arsenal's Tuesday morning training session .","Arsenal face Besiktas on Wednesday in Champions League play-off second leg at the Emirates after 0-0 draw in Turkey last week .

"Missed: John McCormick, a Vietnam veteran, passed away last week after mowing the grass . The family of a man who died of a heart attack after mowing the lawn has thanked the firefighters who returned to their home to finish the job. John McCormick, 67, who had a history of heart problems, passed away two days after suffering a heart attack while cutting the grass in front of his home in Bayton, Texas last Tuesday. When his grieving family returned home, they found a note from the firefighters of Engine 4. 'We felt bad that your husband didn't get to finish the yard,' the firefighters said in their note, which said they had put the lawnmower away in an unlocked garage. 'We are very sorry that your husband became ill, we hope he has a speedy recovery. Let us know if there is anything we can do to help you out.' The firefighters had followed the ambulance to hospital and as they headed back to their station, the idea struck engine driver, Luke Bednarek, to return to the home and finish the lawn. On their way, the men argued over who would cut the grass and firefighter Blake Steffenauer took on the job after being the first to jump out, KHOU11 reported. Act of kindness: After following his ambulance to the hospital, firefighters returned to the home, where they finished the job for the family. They were photographed by neighbors who spotted the good deed . Thoughtful: The men left this note behind, telling the family to let them know if they needed further help . A neighbor spotted the kind act and . snapped photographs of Steffenauer pushing the mower. The photos were . shared online, where they quickly spread. After some . of the other firefighters took a turn to mow the grass - even finishing . the backyard as well - they locked the mower away in the garage and . dropped the key in the mailbox. Lieutenant J.D. Giles left the note and, speaking to KHOU11, insisted they'd done nothing extraordinary. 'Not at all,' he said. 'Just something to help someone out in the worst time of their life.' Steffenauer . added: 'They already got stuff they've got going on that's more . important. Yard work shouldn't be something they'd have to finish up. So . we were happy to come back and take care of that.' At work: The firefighters also mowed the backyard, right, before locking the mower in the garage . All in a day's work: Lieutenant JD Giles, left, said the mowing carried out by his men, including Blake Steffenauer, right, was the least they could do when the family were facing such terrible news . The family expressed their surprise and their thanks to the crew. 'It just showed me that there's still compassion,' McCormick's daughter, Jeana Blackford, told KHOU. 'That people still do random acts of kindness every day for people that they don't know.' His wife Patsy added: 'I just couldn't believe they took the time to do that... Thank you. We love you.' Other members of the Bayton community praised the firefighters. 'All . of our City employees are proud to serve the citizens of Baytown, but . this is truly special,' the city said in a statement posted on Facebook. 'We couldn't be prouder of our guys from Station 4. Our prayers are with the family at this sad time.' Loved: McCormick's wife Patsy (pictured with her husband and one of their granddaughters) said she could not believe the kind gesture and expressed her thanks to the firefighters . John McCormick, an Air Force Vietnam veteran, will be buried with full military honors at Houston National Cemetery on Wednesday. His obituary paid tribute to the loving, very particular grandfather. 'He never met a stranger, never left the house without first getting dressed up,' it read. '[He] enjoyed eating ice cream, drinking coffee, and watching his granddaughter's activities.'","John McCormick collapsed after mowing the grass outside his home in Bayton, Texas last week and passed away two days later .

"David Cameron today insisted he will not pay 'anything like' the £1.7billion being demanded by the EU - after Brussels chiefs warned the UK rebate could be up for grabs if he does not pay up. Budget commissioner Jacek Dominik said it would be 'extremely difficult' for the Prime Minister to challenge the EU's demand for extra cash  – despite Mr Cameron's angry insistence that he will not pay it by the due date of December 1. Mr Dominik said the move risked opening a 'Pandora's box' which could put the future of the UK's £3billion-a-year rebate in question. But in a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon Mr Cameron said: ‘Britain will not be paying two billion euros to anyone on December 1 and we reject this scale of payment.' And in a clear indication that he believes the row has undermined public support for EU membership, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘For those of us who want to argue that the European Union is capable of reform, this was not a good development.’ Scroll down for video . David Cameron was today facing fresh questions over why he did not challenge the EU's £1.7 billion demand earlier . Mr Cameron added: ‘We will be challenging this in every way possible. We want to check on the way the statistics were arrived at, the methodology that was used. We will crawl through this in exhaustive detail.’ And he told MPs: ‘We are not paying two billion on December 1 and we are not paying a sum anything like that. That is very clear. ‘When your economy grows, you pay a bit more. When your economy shrinks, you pay a bit less. But what is not acceptable is a two billion euro bill and we won't be paying it.’ But the Prime Minister was accused of being ‘asleep at the wheel’ by Labour leader Ed Miliband, who said Mr Cameron should have been aware for at least two years that changes to Britain's contribution to the EU budget were in the offing. Ukip MP Douglas Carswell tweeted: ‘Classic Dave: PM sounding tough but so far not actually ruling out paying £1.7 billion. After December. After all the bluster.’ Any change would require amendments to EU law supported by a majority of European countries. European Commissioner Mr Dominik warned that the UK was obliged by law to pay by this deadline and would be liable for 'late payment fines' if it failed to hand over the cash. Mr Dominik said he was 'surprised' by the PM's reaction, insisting that the adjustment of Britain's contribution to the EU budget - known in Brussels jargon as 'own resources' - was a routine annual procedure about which London was well aware. The figures behind the calculation were provided by the UK's Office for National Statistics and the UK was informed on October 17 of the scale of the surcharge being demanded, he said. The Commissioner warned that opening up discussions over the EU's budget threatened the British rebate. European Budget Commissioner Jacek Dominik said it would be extremely difficult to change EU law to give Britain more time to pay the bill . The chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the UK by the EU in comparison with other member states . David Cameron was left red-faced last week after he was forced to admit he had been kept in the dark for days about the shock £1.7billion demand after George Osborne failed to inform him. The surprise bill was presented to the Treasury by the EU Commission on Friday October 17. But extraordinarily it was almost a week before the Prime Minister learnt about it on Thursday. And according to Labour, the Office for National Statistics might have known about it five months ago. But asked what prospect there was for a renegotiation of the cash demand, Mr Dominik told a Brussels press conference: 'Never in the past was there a situation where such a decision was changed and the implementation regulations changed because one of the member states have contested it. 'I am afraid that it will be extremely difficult to do it, especially because the own resources decision and implementation regulations concern as well the UK's rebate, so if you open this for future negotiations, you open a Pandora's box.' But Mr Cameron's official spokesman responded: ‘The rebate remains entirely justified. It is not on the table.’ Mr Dominik said that the same calculation of Britain's gross national income (GNI) produced by the ONS would result in a £500 million increase in the rebate next year, and added: 'I think it would be extremely difficult to explain to other member states why on Monday you like this data, and on Tuesday you don't like it.' Responding to Mr Cameron's claim that the demand was sprung on Britain with little notice, Mr Dominik said: 'I was surprised by the reaction because ... up to this moment there was no single signal from the UK administration that they had problems with this figure.' Speaking to a Westminster press briefing, Mr Cameron's official spokesman made clear that there was no question of the PM putting Britain's rebate - negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984 - on the table. Asked if it was correct that the rebate would not be on the table when Chancellor George Osborne meets fellow finance ministers, the spokesman said: 'Yes.' Labour leader Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of being 'asleep at the wheel' over the EU budget demand . Mr Osborne is later this week expected to discuss the surcharge demand with EU finance ministers, including Germany's Wolfgang Schauble, in the margins of an OECD summit in Berlin on Wednesday. Speaking during a visit to Leeds, Mr Cameron said: 'We face tough battles in Europe because that's the nature of what you have to do.' He added: 'I think Britain is best off in a reformed European Union - but you have to fight for those reforms. That means a fair deal over funding, a fair deal over migration, [it] means access to European markets, but these things aren't achieved without a fight.' The French media today reacted mockingly to Mr Cameron’s refusal to pay Britain’s EU budget contribution – likening him to an angry diner out of Fawlty Towers. All major outlets highlighted the Prime Minister’s fury, with the Dauphine Libere running the headline: ‘Angry Cameron refuses to take out his cheque book for Europe’. Europe 1 radio station was typical of those which took up the Fawlty Towers theme, portraying Mr Cameron as the kind of ranting and very dissatisfied restaurant customer who used to visit Basil Fawlty’s hotel in the 1970s comedy sitcom starring John Cleese. Europe 1 writes on its website: ‘A diner unconvinced by the proposed EU menu, David Cameron refuses to pay the bill. ‘It has to be said this is a bit rich, because Brussels is demanding an additional two billion euros from Britain as part of its share of EU budget. ‘Faced with this request, the British Prime Minister has abandoned the traditional English reserve to rant at a press conference that was held on Friday.’ Le Parisien runs a picture showing Mr Cameron with his mouth wide open, and suggests that he was forced to act in such an angry manner by the success of the UK Independence Party. ‘Under immense pressure from Eurosceptics, notably since the last European elections which saw Ukip win more than 27 per cent of the vote, David Cameron believes that this demand does not support the issue of Britain being in the EU,’ the Paris daily wrote. Like many other papers, L’Express and Le Monde concentrate on the reaction of Francois Hollande to the growing crisis, quoting the clearly irritated Socialist president as saying: ‘Respecting treaties is for everybody.’","David Cameron said he would not pay the EU's demand for extra £1.7billion .

City were fined £50million for the FFP breaches but will only have to pay around £20million if they comply with the break-even rules in future seasons. The first tranche of payments from City, Paris St Germain and Zenit St Petersburg will total £20million and will be split among the Champions League and Europa League clubs who did comply with the rules last season.

"Yorkshire’s celebrations of their first championship title for 13 years were thrown into disarray tonight when their captain Andrew Gale became the first county cricketer accused of using racial language on the field. The newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of Gale, who is accused of abusing Lancashire’s Ashwell Prince towards the end of the third day of an acrimonious Roses match on September 3. It became clear that Gale was facing more than just a dissent charge when he was banned by the ECB not just for two games but also from taking any part in the presentation of the championship trophy at Trent Bridge last week. Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale has become the first county cricketer to be accused of using racial language . And Yorkshire’s worst fears were confirmed last night when it emerged that Gale would be summoned to a disciplinary hearing in London next week on a Level Three or even Level Four charge for racial verbal abuse. The charge will hinge on exactly what Gale, an inspirational captain for Yorkshire, said to the South African in a highly charged passage of play at Old Trafford which opened old wounds between fierce Roses rivals. Sportsmail understands that Prince told Gale to ‘f*** off back to your fielding position’ when the Yorkshire captain was attempting to squeeze in one more over towards the end of play in a push for victory. Gale then told Prince to ‘f*** off back to your own country you Kolpak f*****’ which Yorkshire are adamant should not be treated as racist and are preparing a legal case to defend their captain against the ECB next week. Andrew Gale's celebrations were cut short by accusations that he had acially abused Ashwell Prince . The Kolpak regulation refers to Prince’s status as a non-overseas player, a restraint of trade ruling successfully overturned in the European courts by Slovakian handball player Maros Kolpak, but it is whether ‘go back to your own country’ is interpreted as racist that holds the key to this explosive matter. Yorkshire will ask the hearing whether the same charge would have been brought had the same words been used against a white South African, but the ECB are determined to take a stand against what they see as a serious matter. It was the governing body who took the matter to its own Cricket Discipline Commission after umpires Steve Garrett and Steve O’Shaughnessy reported Gale for a Level Two offence under the ECB code of conduct for using ‘language or gesture that is obscene or of a serious insulting nature to another player, umpire, referee, team official or spectator.’ Gale had been disciplined for dissent earlier in the season, which meant that the latest charge triggered a two-match ban that ruled him out for the championship decider against Notts But it is the escalating of the accusation which has turned it into a far more serious matter. The newly crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain Gale . It was a Level Three charge that was originally thrown at England’s Jimmy Anderson after he clashed with India’s Ravindra Jadeja during the first Test even though there was no suggestion in that case of any racist abuse but it was thrown out through a lack of evidence by the International Cricket Council. Now it is the Yorkshire and former England Lions captain who finds his reputation on the line over the interpretation of words that both he and his county are adamant should not be construed as racist. The ECB, who were criticised for not allowing gale to collect the trophy on Yorkshire’s behalf last week, are clearly determined to make an example of a county captain who is no stranger to charges of dissent. Yet there will be those who accuse the ECB of double-standards because they were so reluctant to become involved when Moeen Ali was booed by Indian supporters at Edgbaston in what appeared to be racist abuse of the England all-rounder’s Pakistani heritage. Gale was expected to parade the championship trophy in front of Yorkshire fans at Headingley next week during their final match of the season against Somerset. Instead he will be fighting to salvage his reputation.","Yorkshire are county champions .

"Fabian Delph looked like he needed a word from a senior player - Wayne Rooney? - to calm him down after his robust early challenges. He should have got a yellow for the first challenge on six minutes and did for the second on nine minutes.

'I have made now the (squad) selection of 27 players - three goalkeepers and 24 players, you shall see it Tuesday with the photoshoot, that is our squad.' Van Gaal was even restrained is his post-match praise for Di Maria, who set United on their way with a curling free-kick and then had a hand in the other three goals. 'When you prepare three goals and make the first goal by yourself then you cannot play bad but he had a lot of unnecessary losses so we can do better,' the former Ajax manager said.

"Crystal Palace have added another player to their ranks by bringing in former striker Andrew Johnson on a free transfer. The 33-year-old has signed a deal which will see him ply his trade in south London until January. Johnson, who has played for Everton, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers since leaving Selhurst Park, left the Eagles in 2006. Palace return: Andrew Johnson has put pen-to-paper on a short-term deal to rejoin the Eagles . Fans' favourite: Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan brought Johnson to the club in 2002 . Legend: Johnson is worshipped at Selhurst Park because of his tremendous goalscoring record at the club . Misery: Johnson, pictured with Nicola Ventola, looks dejected after Palace fail to beat Southampton in 2005 . Johnson joined Palace from Birmingham in 2002 and went on to become a fans' favourite as he helped the club win promotion in 2004. He then scored 21 goals in the top flight the following season, bringing him his first call-up for England, however he could not prevent Palace from suffering relegation. Johnson, speaking to Crystal Palace's official website, said on his return: 'I am delighted to be coming back to a club that I love and have a real soft spot for. 'I would like to thank the gaffer and the chairman for giving me this opportunity and I am looking forward to helping this football club have continued success in the Premier League. 'I have also been given an opportunity to help the youngsters in a coaching capacity, something I am really looking forward to getting involved in.' Johnson, who has been named in Crystal Palace's 25-man Premier League squad, left Selhurst Park for Everton in 2006 for a fee of £8.5million. Neil Warnock’s ninth signing of the summer sees veteran English striker Andrew Johnson return to his former stomping ground. Johnson is remembered fondly by Palace fans after a successful spell with the Eagles from 2002 to 2006, where the former English international scored 74 goals in 140 appearances. Starting his Palace career with a bang, Johnson bagged a hat-trick against rivals Brighton & Hove Albion and then followed his goalscoring heroics up with another against Walsall in the next game. Topping the First Division Football League goal scoring charts in 2003/04 season with 32 goals, Johnson became a revelation at the club under the guidance of manager Iain Dowie. The following season, Johnson helped Palace achieve promotion to the Premier League with a 1-0 win over West Ham at Wembley. This was a major achievement for the club, as just five months before the play-off game, Palace were 19th in the league and under serious threat of relegation. In 2005, Palace fans were asked to vote which players would make it into a ‘Centenery XI’ for the club. Johnson was voted in to the team beating 10 other strikers who were also shortlisted.

"Amazon has now been revealed to sell Holocaust denial and white supremacist literature. The online retailer has been shown to sell books denying the holocaust and promoting anti-Semitism and the superiority of the white race with titles such as The Myth of the Extermination of the Jews and Building a Whiter and Brighter World. The books and ebooks are on sale even in countries that ban such texts, according to an investigation by The Kernel – which first uncovered the hateful Holocaust denial screeds. Shameful: It has now been revealed that online retailer Amazon sells Holocaust denial books . Despite reportedly removing the volumes of violent and horrifying sex-related works disclosed last week from its digital stacks, the online retailer still has a long way to go before cleansing itself of other vile titles. Some of the Holocaust denial books are even on sale in Austria, France and Germany, according to The Kernel, countries whose laws ban such literature. The texts are also illegal in Liechtenstein, where Amazon maintains a European headquarters to reduce tax burden, The Kernel noted. Unlike the rape, bestiality and incest titles disclosed last week, many of these books can be found by searching for them. Shoppers unable to track down their favorite racist titles can also find them in the trusty 'customers who bought this item also bought' product carousel. The racist diatribes were first removed from the online retailer’s virtual shelves in 2009 after the Amazon Germany was sued by the American Jewish Committee for stocking at least 50 Holocaust denial books, according to The Kernel – but the tide of discrimination appears to have come back in. Holocaust denial: Just the latest hateful topic covered by Amazon's vast digital stacks . Don't know where to look? Amazon can help: The online retailer even suggests hate-filled books for people unable to find them on their own . Among the Holocaust denial books is Did Six Million Really Die? The preview questions the validity of claims of gas chambers and alleges many survivor stories have been made up. ‘The Auschwitz Camp Museum has confessed that the ""gas chamber"" shown to tourists is fake,’ the preview says. Later adding that ‘eyewitness survivor’ memoirs, including that of Simon Wiesenthal have been forged.’ The preview ends saying ‘the story was made up.’ There is also a series of books titled ‘Holocaust Handbook Series,' which prominently feature the Nazi symbol, atop the Star of David on the cover of every volume. Ebooks with titles such as Dissecting the Holocaust: The Growing Critique of Truth and Memory, The Myth of the Extermination of the Jews and The Hoax of the Twentieth Century: The Case Against the Presumed Extermination of European Jewry populate the collection. ‘It reads as exciting as a crime novel,’ the preview for the first title mentioned above says. ‘This is the intellectual adventure of the 21st century.’ The First Holocaust: Jewish Fund Raising Campaigns with Holocaust Claims During and After World War I, is another title in the ‘Holocaust Handbook’ series found in a separate MailOnline investigation. There's more: These are just two of the many Holocaust denial titles for sale on Amazon . Other Holocaust denial titles include Auschwitz: The First Gassing. Rumor and Reality and Confessions of a Holocaust Revisionist. The sole purpose of 'Auschwitz' is to disprove the possibility that any Jewish people were ever gassed as the infamous concentration camp. Among some of the more eye-opening anti-Semitic titles in the Amazon store are The Synagogue Of Satan - Updated, Expanded, And Uncensored  and Conspiracy of the Six-Pointed Star. The Synagogue of Satan blames the Jewish people for the slave trade, among other accusations, according to The Kernel. As before, many of these books are Kindle-only, but this time some of them, including ‘Conspiracy’ are also available in hard cover and paperback. Two more: Despite its innocuous title, Expanding Creativity is as hateful as any book on the site . MailOnline’s own investigation also uncovered several white supremacist-promoting materials with the following titles. Building a Whiter and Brighter World, The White Man’s Bible, and Expanding Creativity, which – despite its innocuous title – is actually the latest in a series of writing to which the two books named just before it belong. The WMB’s description boasts that is banned in Canada and is ‘considered as most dangerous literature for modern liberal values.’ The description further states that some ‘areas of concern are extremely important to the survival, expansion and advancement of the White Race' are detailed in its pages. Part of a series: These two books, along with Expanding Creativity promote an all-white religion with the goal of an all-white world population . Movies too: The anti-Semitism ranting extends even to movie reviews . The most bizarre of the white supremacist titles, though, is Trevor Lynch's White Nationalist Guide to the Movies. ‘Since 2001, Trevor Lynch’s witty, pugnacious, and profound film essays and reviews have developed a wide following among cinephiles and White Nationalists alike,’ the book’s description on Amazon reads. ‘He sees movies without the usual blinders,’ the description cheerfully proclaims. ‘He is quite aware that because Hollywood is controlled by Jews, one must typically analyze movies for their propaganda value.’ Mr Lynch’s review of summer blockbuster ‘Django Unchained’ calls it ‘another Jewish wet dream’ before saying that ‘hateful fantasies about teaming up with blacks to harm whites are staples of the Jewish imagination. The movie reviews can be had on the Kindle, in soft cover or via hardcover book. Multiple requests to Amazon for comment from both The Kernel and MailOnline seeking comment were not returned.","The hate-filled literature can be bought in hard copy or paperback, as well as can be downloaded to the Kindle .

"Arsene Wenger certainly won't be short of exciting attacking options as he plots the downfall of champions Manchester City on Saturday. There have been a few injury concerns over the international break, with Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Mesut Ozil picking up knocks. But it appears Wenger will have a clean bill of health and all his Gunners back firing in the top-of-the-table clash at the Emirates. CLICK HERE TO LIKE OUR ARSENAL FACEBOOK PAGE . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger discuss Arsenal vs Manchester City . Centre of attention: Danny Welbeck in training with the Arsenal squad at London Colney on Friday . Arsene Wenger has plenty of options at his disposal for the visit of Manchester City on Saturday . Arsenal will need to incorporate new £16m signing Welbeck into their starting XI for the City match . Commitment: Jack Wilshere is put under pressure by Per Mertesacker, who launches into a tackle . The Arsenal squad assembled for their start-of-season photograph during training on Friday . With £16m deadline day signing Danny Welbeck to throw into the mix, Wenger faces a bit of a selection conundrum in attack. Luckily for the Frenchman, the back line pretty much picks itself at the minute. Wojciech Szczesny will have Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker in front of him. Kieran Gibbs is set to return at left-back in place of Nacho Monreal if the Englishman can prove he's recovered fully from a hamstring injury. All five will have to be at their best to repel City's free-flowing front line and Wenger would be wise to deploy either captain Mikel Arteta or Aaron Ramsey directly in front of them. Arteta is back in full training following his ankle injury and is likely to come back in, but some question marks remain over Ramsey after he rolled his ankle on Wales duty. In keeping with the system utilised this season, the midfield then fans out with Jack Wilshere on one side and Santi Cazorla on the other. With Welbeck set to take up his position as the target man, Alexis Sanchez will drop back to the right side. Mesut Ozil should be available after returning early from international duty with a sprained ankle and will feature on the left. The dilemma for Wenger is that this line-up omits the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers - emphasising the strong options he has at his disposal.

Ozil will be the one to make way if Wenger feels City will be rattled by the pace of Oxlade-Chamberlain. Wenger needs to be wary of being too gung-ho against City - they will pick Arsenal off if given the chance - but they need to make some kind of statement that they are not cowed by these big games. Arsenal have collected just 26 points from a possible 90 against top four opponents over the last five seasons - an awful record that has prevented them sustaining a title challenge. Now, however, there should be optimism around the Emirates that Arsenal have the personnel to do just that. Robbie Savage has called for Mikel Arteta and Mesut Ozil to be kept out of Arsenal's team for the visit of Manchester City. Writing in his Daily Mirror column, Savage says Ozil was a 'passenger' for much of Arsenal's 1-1 draw at Leicester prior to the international break. He also believes Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey should play in place of Arteta, despite the captain's return to fitness.","Arsene Wenger has plenty of attacking options at his disposal for the visit of Manchester City on Saturday .

Left-back Neil Taylor latched on to Ki Sung-Yeung’s defence splitting pass before rolling in a low cross from the left. The Welshman’s pass was destined for Nathan Dyer at the back-post but John Terry, in attempting to cut out the cross, thumped the ball past Thibaut Courtois into his own net. The travelling support were in a frenzy. Their manager, however, was motionless on the touchline. He must have been bubbling over inside though, as his side’s excellent start to the season showed no sign of letting up. Bafetimbi Gomis and Wayne Routledge both went close to increasing Swansea’s lead as Chelsea struggled during the opening exchanges. Dyer, in front of England manager Roy Hodgson who was watching in the stands, and Gomis in particular were causing Chelsea problems. If Swansea had gone 3-0 ahead, Mourinho could have had little complaint. John Terry looked dismayed after Swansea took the lead at Stamford Bridge against Jose Mourinho's side . Swansea celebrate their opening goal after John Terry managed to score an own goal past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois . Diego Costa, who had to undergo a late fitness test, managed to shake off a slight knock to start against Swansea City . The visitors were bright, inventive and dangerous. Chelsea on the other hand were lethargic, sloppy and inefficient. Slowly but surely, however, Mourinho’s men awoke from their Saturday afternoon slumber. Andre Schurrle and Cesc Fabregas wasted free-kicks, both won by Eden Hazard, in threatening positions, before Oscar failed to direct a header goalwards following a cross from Branislav Ivanovic. The Brazil international then saw his low effort from the edge of the penalty area saved by Lukasz Fabianski, before Hazard fired a cross-come-shot wide after an excellent pass by Fabregas. Chelsea were not merely turning the screw, they were tightening it. So it was no surprise when the home side pulled level in the final minute of the first half. The scorer was not a surprise either.

It was, of course, Costa with the simplest of headers from Fabregas’s corner after some slack Swansea marking, as the Spaniard became the first Chelsea player to score in his first four games for the club since John Meredith in 1928. Costa nearly scored again in the 52nd minute but his goalward volley from another Fabregas corner deflected off Hazard before flying wide. But he did not have to wait much longer — just three more minutes in fact — finishing off an attractive move to score his sixth of the season, one more Premier League goal than Fernando Torres scored in the whole of the last campaign. Fabregas and Hazard cut Swansea’s left-hand side to shreds with some intricate passing, leaving Costa to fire the Spaniard’s cut-back past Fabianski to put Chelsea ahead. Their abject start was a distant memory now; Chelsea were vibrant and threatening, looking every inch title contenders. And Costa sealed all three points for Mourinho’s men with another simple finish, tapping past Fabianski after Ramires’ mishit shot from the edge of the area. The striker was given a huge ovation, perhaps the biggest round of applause coming from owner Abramovich, as he was replaced by debutant Loic Remy with 20 minutes remaining. And it took the France international just 10 minutes to open his account following his move from QPR, firing an unstoppable right-foot drive past Fabianski after Oscar’s pass.

Jonjo Shelvey scored a consolation for Swansea four minutes from time. ‘Maybe we should have added one or two after going ahead but second half you saw the power and quality Chelsea have. We couldn’t quite contain them,’ said Monk. ‘We were committed, had a good attitude and tried to play well but I think they’ll be champions.’ It is hard to argue with the Swansea manager on this evidence. Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas combined to devastating effect as they continue to prove just why so many felt Chelsea won the summer transfer window. Costa now has seven goals in his opening four Premier League games, with Fabregas recording six assists. LINK UP . Fabregas laid on for two of Costa’s three goals in a display that showed an underlying understanding the pair have already manufactured. Even though they are both Spain internationals and have played together fleetingly before, the sharpness with which they already read each other’s games will be alarming to title rivals. LOOKING UP . Fabregas’ first movement when picking up possession in midfield is to look for the run of Costa. The striker can come short as well as spin off defenders, offering different options for his midfielder. TEMPERAMENT . Statistics rarely lie: Costa now has a remarkable seven goals after 14 attempts on goal this season. Fabregas, therefore, knew not to panic when the Blues went one down. There is a calmness about both that means Chelsea rarely lose sight of the bigger picture - even if behind in games. THE MOURINHO EFFECT . Jose Mourinho noted Fabregas’ willingness to get forward during a dispiriting first half during which the Spaniard was caught out of position all too often. The manager pushed Fabregas further forward at half-time and he enjoyed the run of Stamford Bridge. BETTERING CHELSEA . It’s fairly simple how Chelsea have already benefitted from the pair signing at the Bridge. Costa now has more league goals than Fernando Torres managed throughout last season while Fabregas intuition in the final third has lessened the creative burden on Eden Hazard.

"Mario Balotelli drove to Liverpool training on Thursday in his £240,000 Ferrari F12 Berlinetta that has been shipped over from Italy. The 24-year-old has now been reunited with his beloved supercar, which was seen arriving at Liverpool's Melwood training base as Balotelli and his team-mates prepare for Saturday's Premier League trip to West Ham. The Italy forward joined Brendan Rodgers side in a £16million switch from AC Milan in August and he will have been buoyed by the fact his luxurious vehicle has finally made the same move.

Balotelli's love of cars is legendary and many of his infamous scrapes and japes have involved one of his motors. The Italy star's most famous vehicle was probably the camouflage £160,000 Bentley GP in which he was spotted in Manchester. His white Maserati was also ticketed in the city centre. Earlier this year, his former fiancee - according to some reports - Fanny Neguesha posted a video on Instagram showcasing Balotelli's love of fast cars. She also put up a picture of some car keys, including those to the Ferrari, a Lamborghini and an Audi. Balotelli is motoring on the pitch after opening his account with a goal against Ludogorets in Liverpool's 2-1 Champions League win on Tuesday.

However, the Liverpool manager added that if Balotelli is to replace Luis Suarez he must show the same drive as the Uruguayan. ‘Mario is a boy who has really looked into the history of the club,’ said Rodgers. ‘He understands the great strikers of the past. We’ve spoken about Suarez and his time here but if you’re clever you’ll remember he’s still young and still learning the game and he still has this hunger to do well. ‘He’ll get fitter and the idea is to persist with him. He’s a good reference for us and he’s improving with each time he trains and plays. It was a brilliant finish and that was exactly what we needed at that time – that bit of genuine Champions League class and he showed that.'

I think you can see what he’s trying to put in for the team. That’s going to be very important. ‘The crowd demand that as the players who’ve been here in the past in that position have been non-stop and he’s becoming attuned to that.

"Angel di Maria has revealed former Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo told him to wear the No 7 shirt at Manchester United due to it's significance at the club. Di Maria, who has penned a five-year contract at the club worth £200,000-a-week wages, has been handed the iconic shirt worn in the past by club legends Ronaldo, Eric Cantona and David Beckham. The Argentina international was unveiled at the club's official press conference on Thursday and remarked how it was Ronaldo who told him the importance of the jersey.

The 26-year-old also revealed his desire to restore Manchester United to the Champions League following his £59.7million plus add ons move from Real Madrid on Tuesday. 'I'm very pleased to be at Manchester United, I like the team and I wanted to come here even though there is no Champions League football this season,' he added. 'I want to help them reach the Champions League again. I'm very pleased that Louis van Gaal chose me to come to Manchester United.

Seventh heaven: Di Maria will wear the No 7 shirt at Old Trafford following his £60m switch . Iconic figure: Ronaldo wore the No 7 shirt at Manchester United during his six years at the club . 'The fee does not bother me, the fact £60m is paid that is for the chairmen to negotiate. I come to play for the club and do my best for them.' Di Maria's arrival to Old Trafford is the club's fourth signing this summer following Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera and Marcos Rojo - taking their spending past £131m. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal believes the signing of Di Maria is a coup that will improve his struggling squad. United have yet to win a game this season, losing their opening Premier League game of the season 2-1 at home to Swansea before drawing 1-1 at Sunderland on Sunday. Keen to impress: Di Maria added that he wants to do his best in helping the club win many trophies . Link man: Van Gaal believes Di Maria can help instill his style of play at Old Trafford . The Red Devils early campaign woes hit a new low on Tuesday when they were thumped 4-0 at League One outfit MK Dons in the Capital One Cup but Van Gaal believes the Argentine will prove beneficial to the club's philosophy.

He can accelerate the game for us but also play for the interests of the team,' van Gaal said at the unveiling of Di Maria. 'That's why we've chosen this player and I hope he will give us good results. We cannot expect after two days training that he is the miracle. No, you have to work for the miracle and he knows that. 'I only buy players that can improve our philosophy. I have spoken about his way of playing in the interests of the team. And he can accelerate our playing style. But he fits our philosophy.

Top talent: Di Maria is United's fourth summer signing which includes Spain midfielder Ander Herrera (pictured) Embarrassing: United were thumped 4-0 at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup second round on Tuesday night . Where Di Maria will feature in van Gaal's preferred 3-5-2 starting line-up is unclear but the Dutchman believes the 26-year-old's versatility means the winger will be equally adept in defence and attack. 'I think he will be a player who can enjoy defence. That’s also a reason we have chosen him. When you see his answers. He is a very modest guy. He wants to work. He showed that last year. He played 52 matches and gave 22 assists. How many players can say that? You are a social human being. And in the football world that is not always the case,' he added. 'I can change the system with him too, which maybe we will do in the future - just like I did against Swansea.

"Aaron Ramsey has hit out at the horror pitch in Andorra that has left him fighting for fitness ahead of Arsenal’s key clash with Manchester City on Saturday. The midfielder will undergo medical tests at Arsenal on Wednesday afternoon after sustaining an ankle injury playing for Wales against Andorra on Tuesday. The Gunners star will return to the club's London Colney HQ  following the international break and will immediately undergo a scan  to determine the extent of the injury. You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . In pain: Aaron Ramsey limped off injured for Wales in their 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifier win at Andorra . Going down: Ramsey picked up a suspected ankle injury while battling for the ball . Hobble: Ramsey is helped to his feet by a physio but he was unable to continue in Andorra . Twisted it: Chris Coleman says he hopes Ramsey's injury wasn't enough to keep him out for too long . Ramsey is touch and go to make a return for Arsenal's showdown with Manchester City on Saturday, but the club do not fear it is a serious injury. The midfielder suffered the injury to his right ankle after falling awkwardly on the artificial 3G surface following a late challenge and faces an anxious wait on the results of medical tests. Ramsey struggled for Wales during their 2-1 victory at the Estadi Nacional that was sealed by Gareth Bale’s brace but revealed the difficulties with playing on plastic and said he cannot wait to return to grass. He flew back to the UK with Chris Coleman’s squad on Wednesday afternoon and now has two days to recover for the visit of champions City to the Emirates. ‘The pitch was very hard, there was no give in it,’ said Ramsey. ‘I rolled my ankle late on. I could feel it. ‘I hope I'll be available for Saturday. Manchester City at home, those are the games you want to play.’ Ice and easy does it: A Wales physio applied immediate treatment to Ramsey's foot after he was substituted . Doubtful: Ramsey's knock now makes him a doubt for Arsenal's  clash with Manchester City on Saturday . The new pitch was only certified by UEFA last week after initial tests showed the ball rolled too quickly but the extra black rubber pellets laid down produced awkward bounces and made movement tricky. ‘I just don't know how you're meant to play football on that pitch to be honest,’ Ramsey added. ‘It was very frustrating, you couldn't play the ball quickly. It was very difficult. ‘Due to the pitch we couldn't get into our stride. Normally we play quick, keep it on the floor, play around teams. We just couldn't do that, we had to take the extra touch, it was bobbling. ‘I hope that's the last time I play on a plastic pitch. It was a great free-kick to win it for us, we're delighted with the points, now we move on and hopefully play on some grass next time.’ Surging run: Ramsey breaks past two defenders during the 2-1 win on Tuesday night . When fit Ramsey’s passing ability should exploit the speed that new £16million striker Danny Welbeck will bring to the Arsenal team. ‘He showed for England what a good player he is with those two goals,’ said Ramsey. ‘He's a player who is very good technically, can get in behind teams and score goals. Hopefully he'll do well for us. ‘He brings runs in behind, pace, and power and his finishing will benefit us for the rest of the season.’","Aaron Ramsey limped off injured in Wales' 2-1 win in Andorra .

"CLICK HERE to catch up on all the stats from the big game, including James Morrison's winning goal . It is hard to know what was most disturbing for Tottenham: four games without a win, successive home defeats without scoring, another flat performance after Europe or the sight of Mauricio Pochettino assuming the 'AVB crouch'. Pochettino had been through the full repertoire. He yelled and screamed and pointed and stamped his feet. He tried to regroup at half-time and made ambitious substitutions in an attempt to jolt his team into life. In the end, none of it worked and the Argentine sank down onto his haunches as Andre Villas-Boas was prone to do as he watched from the same technical area, perhaps engulfed by the same feeling of helplessness.

Unfortunately, the view from ground level was no more appealing for a Spurs boss fast approaching his first North London derby, at Arsenal, on Saturday evening. West Bromwich deserved their first victory of the season and their first at White Hart Lane since 1984. They were solid at the back, industrious, inventive and created enough chances to have scored many more before James Morrison appeared unmarked at a corner to nod in the game's only goal, in the 74th minute. 'I am angry and disappointed,' fumed Pochettino. 'I don't know the best word to show my feelings. We were wrong in the way we played. West Brom arrived here with only two points and last in the table but we need to show respect. 'At the beginning of the game we were too slow, we moved the ball too slowly. We need to play quicker. We need to show more. There was a lack of movement. We showed nerves. You need to be aggressive. The way we played brought risk into the game.' The game after a Europa League fixture can often be a good time to play Spurs. They lost six out of 12, last season, and were sluggish, even though there were 10 changes and only Hugo Lloris remained from the team which started against Partizan Belgrade in Serbia on Thursday. 'It's not an excuse,' said Pochettino. Tottenham were especially vulnerable defending corners, which they were forced to do regularly as Vlad Chiriches conceded several in his determination to over-complicate things in tight defensive areas. Craig Dawson headed over from the first of the day and Joleon Lescott, impressive on his debut, his first game in six months, caught a half-volley sweetly on the turn which seemed destined for the roof of the net until it smashed into Dawson's head. Lloris kept out Craig Gardener's fizzing drive after a short corner routine and the visitors had a strong appeal for a penalty rejected, also corner. Dawson met Morrison's set-piece with a diving header, glancing the ball towards goal only to see it blocked by an outstretched hand belonging to Emmanuel Adebayor.

He also ruled out a goal by Saido Berahino for offside, although on this occasion, the officials got it right. Berahino was a yard offside. Discontent rumbled around White Hart Lane and anxiety gripped Spurs. Not only were they vulnerable at the back but they failed to create anything of note going forward. Seventy minutes had passed before they registered an effort on goal, when Ben Foster saved at the near post from sub Roberto Soldado. 'There was a moment mid-way through the first-half when the mood changed after we had a period of possession and pressure,' said Irvine. 'That can spread around the ground. We've experienced it at home. The fans respond to what they see.' Lloris kept his team in the game. There was a fine save to keep out a swerving effort from Berahino after the young striker skipped past Chiriches, and another to thwart Morrison, but he was finally beaten. Appropriately it came from a corner. It was taken by Chris Brunt from in front of the Albion fans who booed him during a home defeat by Everton, and converted by Morrison, who is not the tallest of players but escaped the attention of Erik Lamela to nod in. Tottenham mustered a late flurry but West Brom hung on without fuss. Having arrived rock bottom of the Premier League, they left with their first win of the Premier League season and a weight hoisted from their shoulders as they prepare for home games against Hull, in the Capital One Cup, and Burnley. 'I'd be lying if I said there wasn't an element of relief,' said Irvine. 'But the over-riding emotion is real pleasure, for players, club as a whole and for our fans.

"Danny Welbeck's status as 'Dat Guy' has penetrated the Arsenal dressing-room, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain used the phrase to mock his new club and international teammate. The Arsenal players seemed to be having a good time as they prepared for the clubs official team photo. Chamberlain enjoyed some banter with Spanish-speaking players including young full back Hector Bellerin, and complained that he is always shunted to the outside of the photo.

"Judd Trump joined Ronnie O'Sullivan in making a painful first-round exit from the Shanghai Masters after falling to Dominic Dale. After pre-tournament favourite O'Sullivan's tumble to Alan McManus on Monday, the loss of Trump on Tuesday evening caused a further major stir and was accompanied by the afternoon exit of four-time world champion John Higgins. Trump lost 5-2 to Welshman Dale, an ever-eager showman who at the age of 42 is still playing a mean game, as was demonstrated in his run to the Crucible quarter-finals earlier this year. Shock: Trump was unable to find his best form after a good start against Dominic Dale . A break of 100 nudged Trump into a 2-1 lead, but Dale held the upper hand thereafter, with runs of 57, 103 and 95 spurring him to a last-16 place. Out: The world No 6 made a century break in the third frame but was then overwhelmed by Dale . Higgins was an arguably more predictable casualty as the 39-year-old fell 5-4 to Ryan Day, another Welshman having a fine day in China. Day had trailed 4-2 but breaks of 55, 102 and 77 in successive frames saw the 34-year-old Pontycymer potter get the better of the struggling Scot, who has not reached a major semi-final for over a year. The long-time standard-bearer for snooker in Wales, two-time Crucible winner Mark Williams, also came through a stiff test as he fended off the 2013 World Championship runner-up Barry Hawkins, pinching the decider to win 5-4 after his Dartford-based opponent ploughed in 144 in the eighth frame. In form: Welshman Dale won four frames in a row to come from 2-1 behind to win the match . Under the cosh: John Higgins also crashed out in a first round which was full of upsets . Ken Doherty set up a first-round clash with reigning world champion Mark Selby after beating Chinese amateur Huang Jiahao 5-3 in their wild-card tussle. China's leading light Ding Junhui began his campaign with a promising 5-1 win over Englishman Jack Lisowski, the highlight being his break of 128 in the fifth frame, while Zhao Xintong and Fergal O'Brien were also victors on the second day of the week-long ranking tournament, which carries a first prize of £85,000.","Judd Trump loses 5-2 to Dominic Dale of Wales .

"Animated characters are part of Japanese life. Although aimed at children in the UK, in Japan they are a part of business and social life. Some see Japan's cute-craze, known as 'kawaii,' as a sign of immaturity, but others believe that it is rooted in a harmony-centred way of life that goes back to ancient animist traditions. Japanese used to worship many gods, and portrayed ghosts as comical characters. In what is seen as the origin of Japanese manga a set of 12th-century scroll paintings humorously portray frogs, rabbits and other animals in human activities, from sumo wrestling to temple worshipping. Created 40 years ago, Hello Kitty is made up of just a few simple strokes: two dots for eyes and a tiny circle for a nose, and no mouth lLast week we found out that Hello Kitty is a girl and not a cat . Now the anthropomorphisation continues apace. Last week it was revealed that Hello Kitty is a girl and not a cat and that Doraemon who really is a cat albeit one with a daily quiz in a national newspaper. Little monster Pikachu hosted a theme cafe in Tokyo this summer. Rilakkuma ('relaxed bear') dangles from teenage girls' school bags. Hello Kitty and Doraemon now face hordes of newcomers, many launched by municipal governments to promote tourism and local products. Regular 'character summits' choose a national favourite. The market reached 2.3 trillion yen (£14billion/$23billion) last year, according to think tank Yano Research Institute Ltd. The cat that's not . Created 40 years ago, Hello Kitty is made up of just a few simple strokes: two dots for eyes and a tiny circle for a nose, and no mouth. In contrast to expressive American characters such as Mickey Mouse and Garfield, Hello Kitty doesn't show emotions, and the simplicity has attracted fans from children to street fashion devotees. An article in the Los Angeles Times last week created an internet firestorm when it explained that the character is not a cat; many insisted she must be. Despite her cat-like ears and whiskers, she is a 'cheerful girl with a gentle heart,' says the official website of her theme park, Sanrio Puroland. Born Kitty White in the suburbs of London, she weighs the same as three apples, enjoys baking cookies and dreams about becoming a poet or pianist. Despite her cat-like ears and whiskers, Hello Kitty is a 'cheerful girl with a gentle heart', says the official website of her theme park, Sanrio Puroland . A lovable bear that's free . Goofy black bear Kumamon is perhaps the most successful of the mushrooming new characters that seek to promote a locality in Japan. Its name means a native of Kumamoto, a prefecture in southern Japan, and the character was introduced on March 12, 2010, the day Japan's high-speed bullet train entered full service in the south. The prefecture doesn't charge a licensing fee to use Kumamon's simple image, and experts say that has been a key to success. As the bear's popularity grew, more and more companies wanted to cash in. Today it appears not only on Kumamoto souvenirs, but also on innumerable products including instant cup noodles, snacks and cosmetics. Not a bear but a pear . A hyperactive Asian pear from the city of Funabashi, just outside Tokyo, has taken Japan by storm in the past year. Funassyi, a combination of Funabashi and the Japanese word for pear, is an exception to Japan's more typically laid-back characters. In a bright yellow, stretchy bodysuit, the pear-fairy jumps up and down frantically and talks in a rapid-fire, high-pitched voice, shouting 'Nashi!' (pear) at the end of each sentence. Funassyi is not an authorised city mascot, but the product of an entertainer from Funabashi. Its popularity exploded after a tea commercial last year. Funassyi appears regularly on TV and is releasing a CD from Universal Music Japan. The character reportedly earned 200 million yen ($2 million) last year. Japan's all-time favourite . Doraemon, a blue robotic cat from the 22nd century, started as a manga character in 1969. It has a four-dimensional pocket in its stomach with a seemingly endless supply of items to help its friends. Among them are a 'time machine' and 'anywhere door' that allows them to travel wherever and to any time period they wish. Doraemon is popular in many parts of the world, including Asia and Latin America, but the television cartoon series didn't debut in the U.S. until this year. Adaptations for an American audience included simplifying the names of two boy characters from Nobita Nobi to 'Noby,' and Gian to 'Big G,' and replacing Japanese yen with U.S. dollars. Doraemon, one of the most popular animation characters in Japan. Characters are not just for kids in Japan, but a part of business and social life . A stress-relieving bear . The 'relaxing bear' is usually seen lounging on a yellow bean bag, sometimes nibbling on snacks, demonstrating an ultimate stress-free lifestyle. The roommate of a 25-year-old female office worker, Rilakkuma's gentle words such as 'sleep and reset' and 'let's worry when that happens' have been compiled in a series of popular books, serving as remedies for stressed-out Japan. Created by San-X, a Tokyo-based character-oriented stationary and gift company, Rilakkuma has raked in more than 10 billion yen ($100 million) from stationary, clothing and book sales since its 2003 debut. Video game megastar . A chubby yellow mutant rodent, Pikachu is the most popular of more than 400 monsters in the Nintendo video game series Pokemon. The series started in 1996 as a pair of game titles for hand-held player Game Boy, and has evolved into playing cards, animation, video games and movies. Pikachu makes frequent public appearances in Japan, especially during summer school break. Besides the theme cafe in Tokyo's fashionable Roppongi Hills shopping complex, hundreds of Pikachus swarmed into Yokohama in mid-August in a 'Pikachu outbreak' event. The next big thing? Japan's latest sensation, Youkai Watch started as a video game, and went big in January with the launch of a cartoon on TV. The story centers on teenage protagonists and their encounters with more than 250 characters, including the popular twin-tail cat Jibanyan and floating spirit Whisper. Children collect special coins to call up their favorite specters on arcade game machines. Many of the coins have sold out, and children and their parents waited for hours in long lines outside stores when new coins and related toys went on sale in early August.","Market for characters was worth 2.3 trillion yen (£14billion) last year .

"After a year roaming the surface of Mars, Nasa has failed to find any evidence that its atmosphere is supporting life, it was revealed today. The Curiosity rover currently scanning the Red Planet has not detected any methane, a gas that is produced by living things. Since landing in Gale Crater last year, every morning and evening the car-size probe has analysed Mars' air and scanned it with a tiny laser in search of the greenhouse gas. Scroll down for video . Disappointment: The Curiosity rover has scanned Mars for methane every day but has not found any, which probably means it does not support life . Not finding it means that it is unlikely that microbes . capable of producing the gas are living below the planet's surface, . scientists said today. NASA had high hopes that the rover would inhale methane after . orbiting spacecraft and Earth-based telescopes detected plumes of the . gas several years ago. On Earth, most of the gas is a by-product of . life, spewed when animals digest or plants decay. 'If you had microbial life somewhere on Mars that was really healthy and . cranking away, you might see some of the signatures of that in the . atmosphere,' said mission scientist Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space . Flight Center. During Curiosity's first eight months on the red planet, it probed . the air during the day and at night as the season changed from spring to . summer. Journey: Curiosity has traveled around one mile in the past year. This map shows where the rover has been between landing at 'Bradbury Landing' on August 6 last year and August 1 . 'Every time we looked, we never saw it,' said Christopher . Webster, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who led the research . published online in the journal Science. Webster said while the . result was 'disappointing in many ways,' the hunt for the elusive gas . continues. While methane is linked to living things, it can also be made . by non-biological processes. Mars today is a hostile place - . extremely dry and constantly bombarded by radiation. Billions of years . ago, the planet boasted a thicker atmosphere and possible lakes. Scientists generally agree that nothing can exist on the Martian surface . at present since it's too toxic. If there are living things on Mars, . scientists theorize they're likely underground. Just because . Curiosity didn't detect methane near its landing site doesn't mean the . gas is not present elsewhere on the planet, said Bill Nye, chief . executive of the Planetary Society, a space advocacy group. At work: Curiosity spends its time analysing all elements of Mars using a series of lasers and probes - but some results have been disappointing fo scientists on Earth . 'Suppose . you're an alien coming to Earth and you landed in the Four Corners . area, would you feel as if you've explored the Earth?' he said. Several . years ago, scientists became excited at the prospect of . methane-producing microbes after Michael Mumma of NASA's Goddard Space . Flight Center noticed a mysterious belch of methane from three regions . in Mars' western hemisphere. Mumma, who had no role in the latest study, said he stood by his observations. Earlier . this month, Curiosity reached its first rest stop in its long trek . toward Mount Sharp, a mountain rising from Gale Crater near the equator. The rover will take monthly readings of the Martian atmosphere during . the road trip, expected to last almost a year. Curiosity previously . found evidence of an ancient environment that could have once been . suitable for microscopic life. While the latest finding diminishes hope . for present-day life, scientists still hope to uncover signs of ancient . life by looking for organic compounds at the base of Mount Sharp.","Curiosity rover has found no sign of methane, which is produced by life .

The eye-catching name is Chambers, who deserves to leapfrog Gareth Southgate’s Under 21s after his exceptional start to the season with Arsenal. Aston Villa midfielder Delph features for the first time in Hodgson’s squad, which will be named at around noon on Thursday. He gained a reputation as a no-nonsense midfielder when he kicked former Leeds boss Dennis Wise in the air in his first training session at the Yorkshire club, before moving to Villa in 2009. He has since established himself as a pivotal part of Paul Lambert’s side. Tottenham left-back Rose and Everton defender Stones will also be called up to the squad.

"Louis van Gaal has revealed he has not been satisfied with Wayne Rooney's performances as a striker so far for Manchester United, but due to his versatility can play him anywhere. Rooney has scored twice in four Premier League appearances for United this season, but new boss Van Gaal has opted for a formation change for the Leicester game with the captain moved into midfield in order to make room for Radamel Falcao to make his first start for the club. The Dutchman told Sky Sports before the game: 'We have played well but can improve and I was not so satisfied with [Wayne] Rooney as a striker and [Juan] Mata as midfielder and that's why I'm changing. Wayne Rooney clips a ball forward during Manchester United's game against QPR . Wayne Rooney celebrates his goal in Manchester United's 4-0 win over QPR last weekend . 'Rooney can play in more positions, he's a multi-functional player and I have tried him in a striker's position. He's played well but not spectacular and [Radamel] Falcao is a striker and I think he can do it better. 'We have started again because we have played with new system and philosophy is the same and the players have to adapt and that's always difficult.' In an interview prior to the game with Sky Sports Rooney conceded that while his preferred position is playing upfront, he is happy to play wherever the manager feels best to utilise him. Wayne Rooney scores for Manchester United against Swansea in his first game as captain for the Red Devils . The 28-year-old also scored for England in his first game as captain  against Norway at Wembley . He said: 'I'm happy to play out wide; I can do a job there and I can do a job up front. It depends on the situation of each game and what the manager wants me to do.' Rooney also agreed with claims he is not the player he used to be, with the 28-year-old saying he is now a much maturer game than when he first joined United. He added: 'I'm not the player I was... I feel I've progressed my game. 'So I agree with the people who say my game has changed. I done too much running when I was younger and then didn't have the energy to get myself into goalscoring positions in the box. 'I'm a cleverer player now and know when to run into the box and when not to, and as a result more chances have come my way and I've scored a lot more goals for the club.'

"The head of Chicago's largest hedge fund has been accused of using 'coercion' to pressure his wife into signing a prenup in 2003 that could now keep her from claiming a significant share of her husband's $5.6billion fortune. Anne Dias-Griffin, 43, filed a petition in response to Kenneth Griffin, 45, who initiated the divorce back in July while his wife was driving to the airport with their three children for vacation. At stake is Mr Griffin's large fortune, reported by Bloomberg to be $5.6billion. Mr Griffin founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990 and it now manages $16billion of assets according to Forbes. Under pressure: Anne Dias-Griffin, 43, claims her husband, Ken Griffin, 45, got her to sign the prenup limiting her share in divorce proceedings through 'coercion.' Mrs Dias-Griffin is also seeking sole custody of the kids, ages 6, 4 and 2, in order to move them with her to New York. The prenuptial agreement was signed back in 2003 and outlined the 'division of marital and non-marital property.' According to the filing, Mrs Dias-Griffin was not able to look over the prenup with a lawyer until shortly before the wedding, and it was only three days before the ceremony that Mr Griffin's financials were disclosed. At the time, Mrs Dias-Griffin was in charge of her own hedge fund, Aragon Global Management, in New York. Mrs Dias-Griffin said that after explaining her misgivings, 'Ken became so angry, violent, and intimidating, that he destroyed a piece of furniture in their home.' Page Six quotes a source that explains, 'he was holding onto their four-poster bed, one post became unstuck and the bed collapsed.' Moving on up: Ken Griffin purchased a penthouse at the Park Tower in Chicago for a record-breaking $15million . Fantasyland: The Griffins' wedding ceremony took place over two days in 2003 at the Hameau de la Reine, the estate built for Marie Antoinette in Versailles, France . Mr Griffin finally suggested that they visit a psychologist to settle the dispute. The petition states that, 'Anne was unduly influenced by Kenneth and the psychologist under the guise of a counseling session with a neutral psychologist.' Mrs Dias-Griffin found out later that Mr Griffin and the therapist had a business relationship, and claims the only purpose of the meeting was to persuade her to sign the agreement right before the rehearsal dinner. The ensuing wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and superstar diva Donna Summer, according to Fortune. Attorneys for Mr Griffin at Berger Schatz released a statement calling these claims 'salacious and simply untrue.' 'Ken will respond to Anne’s allegations on the merits, move this process forward, and protect his close relationship with the children,' it went on to state. According to Mrs Dias-Griffin, the closest Mr Griffin has been to spending time alone with his children was four weekends he spent with the six-year-old and a caregiver. He left Mrs Dias-Griffin in 2012 and at the time she was pregnant with their youngest child. The divorce filing 'blindsided' Mrs Dias-Griffin in July, according to a source quoted by the New York Post, and led her to hire Robert S. Cohen, who has represented clients such as Michael Bloomberg and Ivana Trump. Fortune: Ken Griffin's wealth is not only financial, he bought four properties in Palm Beach (left) that totaled $130million, and owns a Jasper Johns he purchased for $80million from David Geffen . The filing claims the prenup would exclude Mrs Dias-Griffin from the couple's vast art collection and real estate holdings. In 2012, Mr Griffin spent $15million on a penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, believed to be the most ever paid for such a property in the city. Last year, the hedge fund billionaire purchased four Palm Beach properties for $130million to add to his portfolio. The couple also own a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17million, The Wall Street Journal reported. The Griffins have donated widely to philanthropic endeavors and political campaigns, leaning in support of Republican causes. They are also keen art lovers. In 2006, the Griffins bought contemporary painting False Start by Jasper Johns for a reported $80 million from media mogul David Geffen. Mrs Griffin is said to have encouraged her husband's love of art and they had their first date at a museum. She is a director of the Museum of Modern Art, a trustee of the Foundation for Contemporary Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr Griffin has been married before but divorced in the mid-Nineties.","Anne Dias-Griffin, 43, claims Ken Griffin, 45, pressured her to sign agreement with the help of a therapist he had a business relationship with .

Zanotti, who won the BMW International Open earlier this season, was on the 16th fairway when he was injured by a ball struck from the 14th tee. The 31-year-old received treatment on the course and was then taken to hospital.

"George Groves made a fist of making the statement he needed, even though he could not quite apply the exclamation required to put the seal on his winning of the European super-middleweight title. This victory over defending champion Christopher Rebrasse brings with it not only a belt but the prospect of a mandatory challenge to WBC world champion Anthony Dirrell. As evidence that his self-belief and ring-craft have survived that knock-out from hell by Carl Froch, this performance was impressive enough. George Groves lands on Christopher Rebrasse as he heads for a unanimous points win in London . Groves was in control throughout but was unable to deliver the knockout blow against the Frenchman . GROVES            ROUND          REBRASSE . 10                       1                       9 . 10                       2                       9 . 10                       3                       9 . 10                       4                       9 . 10                       5                       9 . 10                       6                       9 . 10                       7                       9 . 10                       8                      10 . 9                       9                      10 . 10                     10                      9 . 9                      11                     10 . 10                     12                     10 . 118                TOTALS               112 . But Groves will need to bounce back significantly higher when and if he takes on Dirrell and he must hope that his new German promoters have pockets deep enough to make the Ameican an offer to come to Wembley which he cannot afford to refuse. The Saint is capable of raising his game, again, and has earned the right to prove as much. Although he admitted: ‘I want to knock people out and I couldn't do that, But I gave it a real good go.’ The loyal Londoners in Wembley Arena were satisfied with that and roared their approval of a self-assessment as honest as the fight was entertaining. If not 80,000 at the Stadium next door when he was knocked into the blue yonder by Froch, who was at ringside commentating for Sky, an attendance of 6,300 in the Arena was highly respectable after two defeats by the Nottingham Cobra. Groves (a Chelsea fan) celebrates with Arsenal duo Lukas Podolski (right) and Mesut Ozil after his victory . The Londoner threw almost 1,000 punches to win by unanimous decision in front of a passionate home crowd . Groves is now the European champion but has his sights set on winning the world title next . Groves knew he needed to make an impression and raced into the fight at blistering speed, winning the first seven rounds on my card. The left jab was piston-like in the first half of the bout and the right hooks razor sharp. But the longer the Frenchman survived the more he edged into the affair and there was slight frisson of concern about Groves' stamina. He conceded that he had to pace himself in the later stages, which was acceptable since he risked punching himself out. Rebrasse edged a round or two towards the end. And he raised his own question mark about the Saint’s power by dropping his hands after being caught with a snappy combination and beckoning his challenger forward. The verdict was decisive enough, 118-110 according to two of the judges and 117-111 on the card of the other. I had Groves winning by 118-112. Groves is now the mandatory challenger to WBC world champion Anthony Dirrell (right) Groves entered the ring to a Shakespearean reading of ‘Cry God for England, Harry and St George,’ followed’ by his brass band’s rendition of ‘When the Saints Go Marching In’ and roars from his army of fellow Londoners. There were boos, of course, for the European champion from France. Groves was businesslike from the first bell, dictating with his left jab and landing some early right crosses. The odd flurry came from Rebrasse but it was clearly Groves’ round. He maintained the blistering opening pace in the second session but Rebrasse changed up a gear and was more competitive in the exchanges. Groves was clearly going for a quick finish but his face reddened, even though this was another impressive round. Rebrasse was rocked by a succession of big rights but fought back, to the disappointment of fans sensing blood. Groves was also working well to the body but there was no sign yet of the Frenchman wilting despite the punishment. Champion Groves celebrates his win over Rebrasse . At the start of the fourth, the pace had to slow a little but Groves was still dictating from behind a ramrod left jab. Rebrasse did stop him in his tracks with a solid right and Groves walked onto another at the bell but it was still the Saint's round. Groves, fully committed on the front foot, continued to be first with the jab. It helped that Rebrasse did not appear to have the power to hit him like Froch, even though he was throwing defence to the wind at times and getting caught by some counters. Rebrasse was enjoying a little more success as the fight approached the midway mark while Groves was losing a little accuracy and was forced on to the retreat for the first time. But it was still not quite enough to stop the rounds slipping away from the Frenchman. Rebrasse was presumably hoping Groves would weaken late – as he did twice against Froch – but there was no sign of it by the seventh stanza. Another Saintly round, even though this was again a little closer. Rebrasse was holding the middle or the ring and fully in the fight by the eighth and came out equal from a thunderous exchange on the ropes – and in a round for the first time. Groves was missing more and his corner was urging him to keep the initiative but he had to ride more accurate French combinations and lost a round for the first time with three to go. The challenger landed big-time lefts and rights but Rebrasse took the shots, dropped his hands and beckoned the Saint forward – somewhat unwisely. Groves found a second wind to raise his work-rate again after the disappointment of the ninth to win this one but looked the more weary as they trudged back to their corners. Rebrasse landed the cleaner punches in the penultimate round, while the big blows from Groves were more sporadic. Although he had the decision - and with it the title – in his pocket, he dropped another round. Groves was blowing – but still throwing, albeit mostly off target or blocked punches. His chin withstood a big right – before the new and old European super-middleweight champions embraced at the final bell. Luke Campbell continued his fine form against Krzysztof Szot on the undercard at Wembley Arena . Groves speculated that he could fight Froch for a third time, although the Cobra will be having no truck with the appeal, no matter how loudly the local fan club scream at him. The Cobra has bigger fish to fry, if he decides to box again. But the Saint is back, on the road to redemption, chasing a world title of his own. Meanwhile, earlier in the evening there were victories for the Yafai brothers Kal and Gamal. The former, and elder, stopped Herald Molina in the second round while his sibling went the six-round distance with Sofiane Bellahcene. There was also an eighth straight win for Luke Campbell who knocked out Krzysztof Szot in the seventh. He faces a much tougher task against Daniel Brizuela in Hull next month.","George Groves won by unanimous decision at Wembley Arena .

"CLICK HERE for all facts, stats and graphics from the big match at Loftus Road . As one striker was on his way out of QPR, another was announcing himself with his first-ever Barclays Premier League goal. Loic Remy was pulled out of QPR’s squad by manager Harry Redknapp at the last minute after a bid from Chelsea triggered his £10.5million release clause. But while Remy was busy negotiating a deal with Chelsea, Austin stepped up to rattle in a shot from close range for QPR’s first win of the season.

The 25-year-old has come a long way from non-League Kintbury in Berkshire and if his scoring record up until this point is anything to go by, there will be many more goals to come. Redknapp said afterwards: ‘Hopefully he can be like Rickie Lambert for us. A lot of strikers have come out of the lower leagues: Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ian Rush. I’m sure Charlie will score at this level.’ Redknapp’s phone rang in his post-match press conference. ‘It’s Charlie Austin’s grandad,’ he added, laughing. ‘He’ll be proud.’ In first-half stoppage time Austin finally provided the game with the goal it was screaming out for. Joey Barton sent in a corner from the left which was nodded down and back by Leroy Fer and smashed in first-time by Austin. It was a marvel that the match had not had a goal before that. Fer, an £8million signing from Norwich, rattled the crossbar with a 25-yard scorcher on 31 minutes, hit so powerfully there could have been tremors felt in the School End behind the goal. The game was played at a frenetic pace right from the start. Sunderland’s Connor Wickham had to clear Austin’s header off the line in the third minute and, moments before he scored, Austin was close again. Fer picked him out with a pass and his first touch beat John O’Shea, but when he tried to round Vito Mannone, the Sunderland goalkeeper dived at his feet and took ball and man. QPR squeezed the pressure as half-time approached and Matt Phillips had a volley blocked before Steven Caulker headed just wide, just before Austin opened the scoring. But it was not all one-way traffic and Adam Johnson was busy threading passes from midfield. On 11 minutes he slipped in Steven Fletcher and QPR goalkeeper Rob Green had to dive low to save the striker’s effort. Seven minutes later he put in left-back Patrick van Aanholt who had raced forward from the back, but his first-time shot curled just over. Finish: Austin was making his first appearance since picking up an injury in the 1-0 defeat away to Hull a fortnight ago .

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Chances galore turned into frustration in the second half. Not that Redknapp would have minded. Sunderland initially made tentative efforts to get an equaliser, wary of conceding the killer goal. Jack Rodwell hustled and bustled in the box and got a shot away in the 52nd minute but Green put his body behind the ball. Two minutes later Santiago Vergini drilled an effort from inside the box and Green was down sharply to save again. Sunderland finally pushed hard for an equaliser in the final 10 minutes. Clint Hill blocked a cut back from Johnson on the right and, only four yards from goal, somehow diverted the ball over the bar and substitute Emanuele Giaccherini hit a rocket which Green leapt back to keep out. ‘We are not enough, we know the numbers I want to work with,’ Sunderland manager Gus Poyet complained. ‘I am going to be on the phone all the time. Sunday is supposed to be a day off. I am not a fan of the window open during the season.’ Under watch: QPR's veteran defender Clint Hill pays close attention to Adam Johnson as the winger makes a break down the flank .

"There is something about Anfield’s atmosphere on European nights that could prove really significant when the Champions League starts again this week. Liverpool are back for the first time since they were knocked out in the group stages in 2009. Many would say they are back where they belong because of the incredible history of those European Cup-winning sides of the Seventies and Eighties — and that truly extraordinary night in Istanbul in 2005. It is a tournament that is in the DNA of the club and some European teams will leave Liverpool this season having had the shock of their lives, playing in front of that crowd in a Champions League night game. Brendan Rodgers (right) is preparing Liverpool for their Champions League return after five years away . On those evenings, there are few stadiums that can compare. And although Liverpool are back for the first time in five years, the other English clubs — Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal — cannot come close to Liverpool in terms of tradition in this tournament. Of the current players, only Steven Gerrard has helped to create that history but sometimes that does not matter because many fans watching will have seen Liverpool in the Seventies and Eighties and would have been in Istanbul. There is something about the energy that a crowd can give you that can make the difference on these occasions. Steven Gerrard celebrates on a dramatic night at Anfield where Liverpool beat Olympiakos to advance . Steven Gerrard fires home arguably his most famous goal ever to see Liverpool past Olympiakos . Saturday evening was a good example of the difference Europe makes — the atmosphere was flat in the 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa. I’m sure it will be different on Tuesday night. Liverpool have given their squad depth and can be scintillating in attack. They are also well disciplined and drilled tactically. Put all that together with an emotional Anfield crowd and many teams will come away wondering what has happened to them. Liverpool can get out of their group against Real Madrid, Basle, and Ludogorets. On their day, they could even give Real a shock and I have them down to make the quarter- or semi-finals. In contrast, Manchester City have the squad size and the quality to win the Champions League, but at times they have played like novices in the tournament. It does not make any sense, because they have players who have now played in World Cup or Champions League finals and who have plenty of experience on the European stage. Liverpool fans at the famous Kop end come alive on Champions League nights at Anfield . Liverpool parade the Champions League on an open-top bus outside Anfield after winning it in 2005 . Luis Garcia punches the air after scoring against Anderlecht at Anfield in 2005 . But, somehow, that doesn’t translate on the pitch. Maybe as a club they need to build up some belief that will transmit itself to the players. It is almost as if those players, with all their experience, still have a psychological hurdle to overcome because the club are so new to the tournament. That said, tactics have also played a part in City’s struggles, especially last year when Manuel Pellegrini played two strikers against the best teams. They ended up getting battered against Bayern Munich at home last season and it will be fascinating to see whether he does the same when they take on Bayern at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. Champions League games need a different plan from Premier League matches. Former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson realised that. At the start of his career he was faithful to his 4-4-2 formation, but to win the Champions League he modified it to ensure he had an extra man in midfield. Liverpool suffered a domestic setback on Saturday when Gabby Agbonlahor sealed victory for Aston Villa . With their spending, it is clear that City’s owners expect to win the Champions League — and soon — but I don’t believe this will be their year. Arsenal will have their moments and impress going forward. But I still feel they will be found out defensively. I was surprised they didn’t sign another holding midfielder or a centre-half. Chelsea are probably the best- placed English team to win it. What I like about their squad is the balance. That back four doesn’t look like it’s going to let in goals, their midfield is considerably stronger than last season with Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic, and they have added Diego Costa up front. What I feel will cost them is a sustained challenge for the Premier League. It is harder for English clubs to compete in Europe because there are more domestic games against strong rivals compared to Spain and Germany. And matches against lower-placed sides have more intensity, too. Chelsea have a superb core of 14 players, but they will struggle in Europe if they pick up injuries. Manchester City are yet to seriously challenge for the Champions League during their short European history . Bayern Munich will be first up for Manchester City at the Allianz Arena when they kick off their 2014 campaign . That’s why I think the most likely winner will come from Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Barcelona have added Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic, Jeremy Mathieu and Thomas Vermaelen but new coach Luis Enrique will be keen to ensure they are blooding youngsters from the academy. So much will depend on Lionel Messi. He didn’t look himself at the World Cup but if he can return to his best, then they can beat any team. Holders Real Madrid have great options in attack, especially having signed James Rodridguez, but I wonder about the balance. Arsenal scraped past Besiktas in the play-off round to make it into the group stages of the Champions League . Diego Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea to continue his blistering start at Chelsea . The fact that Sami Khedira is injured and they sold Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich reminds me of when president Florentino Perez sold Claude Makelele to Chelsea in 2003. Up to that point, Real were winning league titles and won the Champions League. After Makelele left they didn’t win the Champions League until this year and went four years before they won the league again. That is what happens when presidents sign players. As for Bayern, signing Alonso might be really significant, especially as Javi Martinez and Thiago are injured. He brings balance to any team. They are full of World Cup winners in Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller and up front they have added Robert Lewandowski. Perhaps that makes Bayern marginal favourites. It would be nice if it were an English team, but I just don’t see it. Barcelona have added Luis Suarez (centre) to a squad already filled with superstars . Defending champions Real Madrid have been drawn in the same group as Liverpool this season . Talk is cheap and if we really want English sides to do well in the Champions League we should ensure they receive the best help. Jose Mourinho has often brought up the fact that the Premier League scheduling does our teams no favours, whereas Spanish sides often play on a Friday night to allow more preparation time. The Premier League should do the same, or at least start at 12.45pm on Saturdays. Our teams are playing in a more competitive league than their rivals and we need to make sure they are not at a disadvantage.","Champions League returns this week as group stage begins .

"Jose Mourinho tore into his ‘lazy’ Chelsea team at half-time to inspire the Blues to the top of the Barclays Premier League with a 2-0 win over Leicester. Chelsea laboured in the first half against newly-promoted Leicester before Mourinho’s tirade sparked them into life and goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard sealed victory at Stamford Bridge. The improved performance did not, however, spare the team from post-match criticism. Laboured: Diego Costa gave Chelsea the lead but the hosts made hard work of Leicester . Come on lads: Jose Mourinho cut a frustrated figure during the first half at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho, though, was not happy with the slow start. He said: 'I prefer to train in the morning, but this week I trained in the afternoon because this is not the best weather to play football, you get lazy. 'This weather pushes players to be a bit lazy, to lose a bit of tension, a bit of sharpness in your body, after that you pass slow, you do not react to the second balls, the time goes on and on, then when you wake up, it is half-time. Get in there: But he had plenty to celebrate in the second half as the Blues went onto win 2-0 . Tetchy: Chelsea and Leicester players argue after a bad challenge by Dean Hammond on Andre Schurrle . 'In the first half, the team was lazy, and I did not like that. 'But they improved in the second half and they won, which is the most important thing. 'At half-time, we had to be a bit emotional with them. I told them the way we were playing was not good enough to win the game and that we were at risk. 'It is impossible to play football if you do not win one second ball, it was basic but important things."" Mourinho continued: 'I told them if you have the same feeling and vision I have, we are not in trouble, because we change, but if you do not agree, we are in trouble and do not win the game. 'In the second half, it was better as we were a positive and enthusiastic, so we were too strong for them. 'But let's not forget that they had a one-on-one situation against Courtois.' Mourinho had made another big selection call in leaving striker Fernando Torres out of the match-day squad, which included Didier Drogba who received a warm welcome on his return to Stamford Bridge. New hero: Costa wheels away to celebrate his first goal for Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Decisive: Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois denies David Nugent - minutes before Costa strikes . Opportunity missed: Leicester players Liam Moore, Jeff Schlupp and Paul Konchesky react to Nugent fluffing his lines . Torres has been linked with a move to Italy, but Mourinho has no intentions of off-loading the Spaniard. 'The reason is I decided to keep the same team, to have a bench with a complete balance. Sometimes I can have two strikers on the bench, sometimes I cant,' he said. 'I want three strikers in the team. Sometimes I play with two, one on the bench, sometimes someone will be injured or suspended. 'I cannot do a season without three strikers. 'I want him (to stay). 'He will play and score goals, to be very useful for us, he is a fantastic guy, a fantastic professional, so there is no problem.' Costa, signed from Atletico Madrid, opened his account at Burnley, and Mourinho has been impressed by the speed of the Brazil-born forward's transition. 'I got the feeling in pre-season that his adaptation would not be a big deal, he is an easy guy,' said Mourinho. Denied: Kasper Schmeichel made several top saves to deny Chelsea, including this one from Schurrle . Love in: Chelsea fans make their feelings about boss Portuguese tactician Mourinho clear . 'His style of play has adapted to our needs, so it has not been a problem.' Leicester could count themselves somewhat unfortunate not to have pushed Chelsea harder given their efforts up to the hour mark. Foxes boss Nigel Pearson feels his side, who drew 2-2 against Everton on the opening weekend, should not be too downhearted. 'The players are disappointed we were unable to convert an encouraging performance with the reward of points, but there are a lot of positives from today,' he said. Good effort: Nigel Pearson was satisfied with Leicester's performance despite the result . 'The good thing is we created chances throughout the game and we wanted to be positive. 'For the most part, we played very well today, but as always it is going to be about how efficient you are in both penalty areas and we did not quite find the right way today.' Pearson, meanwhile, confirmed there was no further progress on a proposed transfer for Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, but wants to bring fresh faces in ahead of the September 1 deadline. The Leicester manager said: 'It is not that we have not been trying. It is clear we do need one or two more players, and we will endeavour to add to the squad.'","Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was far from happy despite making it six points out of six against Leicester .

"Lewis Hamilton hit the top of the timesheets in Singapore as error-prone Pastor Maldonado hit the wall. Hamilton posted the quickest lap of the afternoon session, 1.5seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg, who was  way down the order with only the 13th best time. The session was temporarily suspended after Maldonado lost control of his Lotus through Turn 10 before crashing into the wall. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Lewis Hamilton was fastest in the second session ahead of this weekend's Singapore Grand Prix . Pastor Maldonado's car is towed away following his crash during free practice two . The error-prone Venezuelan gets out of the car after crashing on the exit of Turn 10 . And the Venezuelan's incident hampered Rosberg who was conducting his low-fuel qualifying run on the supersoft tyres. It brings to the end a run of seven consecutive one-two finishes at the conclusion of practice on the Friday of a race weekend. Since the first race in 2008, the infamous 'crashgate' event won by Fernando Alonso, there has never been a Singapore Grand Prix without a safety car. It came as no surprise, therefore, a red flag emerged during practice - and even less of a surprise it was Maldonado who caused it. The stage is set for what is set to be another spectacular race under the lights in Singapore . Eyes on the prize: Nico Rosberg is 22 points ahead of Hamilton with six races of the season remaining . Maldonado, involved in more crashes than most throughout his career, lost the rear of his Lotus emerging out of Turn 10, sending the front-right ploughing into a wall. There was further consternation for the team's mechanics as they watched the car being recovered by the marshals. Swinging around loosely on the end of a crane as the marshals looked on, on a couple of occasions it banged against the track, causing further damage before finally being steadied. For Rosberg, forced to abort his flying lap, the German was forced to settle for his best time on soft tyres of one minute 49.075 seconds. That was 1.5secs adrift of Hamilton who led the way with 1min 47.490secs, finishing 0.133secs clear of Alonso in his Ferrari. Hamilton was fastest in the afternoon session, but was not completely happy with the handling of his Mercedes . 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:47.490 . 2.

That was as surprising as the fact Alonso also finished out in front at the end of FP1, the first time the Spaniard had done so since first practice in Canada. At this stage Alonso would appear to be in a position to give Rosberg and Hamilton a run for their money in qualifying on Saturday as the tight, twisty Marina Bay Street Circuit is to his car's liking. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was third quickest, three tenths of a second adrift, followed by Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari. Four-times champion and winner of this event for the last three years in Sebastian Vettel was a remarkable fifth, 0.551secs behind Hamilton in his Red Bull. At the end of FP1 Vettel's car suffered an engine issue which resulted in his mechanics spending all of their lunch break and the majority of FP2 working to replace the system. With 10 minutes remaining Vettel finally made it out on track on a set of supersoft tyres to push himself up the order. The McLaren duo of Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button were sixth and seventh quickest, both just under a second off the pace, followed by Force India duo Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez. Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat rounded out the top 10, with Max Chilton 20th for Marussia, four seconds off the pace. Nico Rosberg was off the pace in the second practice session in Singapore, posting only the 13th best time .","Hamilton ended the second session fastest in Singapore .

"CLICK HERE for all the stats from White Hart Lane. Luckily, Harry Redknapp already has enough happy White Hart Lane memories to last him a lifetime. Because on Sunday, returning to Tottenham, his Queens Park Rangers team were destroyed in a wholly one-sided encounter. It was a day of intriguing sub-plots, Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino’s first home game, Leroy Fer and Mauricio Isla making their QPR debuts, while former coach Les Ferdinand also made his return to White Hart Lane after his summer departure following Tim Sherwood’s sacking — as guest of QPR chairman Tony Fernandes. But the most interesting storyline was Redknapp’s return. There was no fairytale ending though, only misery, as he watched his team — and their new 3-5-2 formation — blown away. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp admit that QPR played like a team of strangers in Sunday's 4-0 to Tottenham .

Redknapp was afforded a warm welcome by Spurs supporters on his first return to the ground since his controversial sacking in 2012.However, the QPR fans were not pleased midway through the second half when their manager answered calls from home fans to give them a wave, triggering boos from the already frustrated travelling contingent. ‘A disappointing day, very disappointing,’ admitted Redknapp. ‘We started poorly and didn’t get out of it. We looked a little bit like a team of strangers. ‘It doesn’t hurt more because it’s Spurs, it’s three points. That’s all that matters to me. Getting beat here is no different to getting beat anywhere else.’ Redknapp will have left knowing that under Pochettino, this current Spurs team have the potential to recreate the free-flowing winning football that became a feature of his four-year Tottenham reign. Following Sherwood’s dismissal, chairman Daniel Levy entrusted Pochettino with the task of bringing flair back to White Hart Lane. And, Tottenham showed tangible evidence the Argentine is heading in the right direction. ‘At the moment we want to put in place our philosophy and try always to convince we can play in the way Tottenham played in their history,’ said Pochettino. ‘But it’s important to keep the reality and stay calm because if you lose two games, you are in danger. ‘It’s always better when you win. It’s easier to develop your style and philosophy when you win. We are top of the table but it’s nothing because it’s two games in.’ Same again: Chadli (right) finishes off a slick passing move from the home side with a powerful header to put Tottenham 3-0 ahead in their first home game of the season .

Jan Vertonghen 10 . Nabil Bentaleb 6 . Younes Kaboul 4 . Erik Lamela 3 . Danny Rose 3 . Nacer Chadli 2 . Eric Dier 2 . Emmanuel Adebayor 2 . Christian Eriksen 1 . Hugo Lloris 1 . For QPR, the signs were ominous from the outset, Tottenham dominating possession; Pochettino’s high-pressing style already having a clear influence. It took 12 minutes for Spurs to open the scoring, Nacer Chadli coolly finishing at the back post after Richard Dunne failed to deal with Emmanuel Adebayor’s cross from the left. Matt Phillips missed an undeserved chance to equalise for the visitors on 20 minutes, firing over with just Hugo Lloris to beat. Redknapp knew it was the sort of chance his side could not afford to squander, and he was right as Spurs set about putting themselves three goals clear before half-time. Christian Eriksen rattled the bar with a superbly executed 30-yard free-kick in the 24th minute before Spurs’ latest hero Eric Dier added to his growing reputation by scoring Tottenham’s second, nodding home Erik Lamela’s 30th-minute near-post corner after slack marking from Fer. Seven minutes later, Lamela showed why Tottenham have been so keen to persevere with him despite a disappointing first season. He cut through QPR’s shell-shocked defence before producing an inch-perfect cross to leave Chadli with the simple job of heading past Rob Green. After a difficult first season at Spurs, the Argentine showed signs of major progress. Two first-half assists provided tangible evidence of that, but it was his body language and demeanour that was perhaps most impressive. Lamela wanted the ball at every turn, not afraid to express himself — a far cry from last season’s injury troubles. But how Chadli was afforded the freedom of the penalty area to score his second will have infuriated Redknapp. Much has been made of QPR’s switch to a 3-5-2 system, but no formation or tactics could account for the woeful individual defending that cost QPR three goals. Television cameras at White Hart Lane cut to Spurs legend Glenn Hoddle, now a QPR coach, sitting in the stands, furiously writing notes before the half-time break.

Dunne carried the can for QPR’s defensive woes, the Irishman substituted by Nedum Onuoha at half-time. But the second half was only ever going to be a damage-limitation exercise for Rangers. Spurs added one more, Adebayor scoring a deserved goal after excellent work from Chadli and Danny Rose. For Pochettino the future looks bright after three wins. Next week, though, Liverpool will provide a clearer view of the progress made under the Argentine. For Redknapp, far from looking to the future, his return to White Hart Lane may cause him to look back in anger at this humilating defeat.

Twice Tottenham took the lead and twice they let it slip and it is the squandering of what should have been all three points that will occupy their manager Mauricio Pochettino in the coming days. He admitted as much himself afterwards, repeating that he had to ‘analyse’ what happened. He summed it up perfectly, though, when he said: ‘We managed the game. We controlled it, but we did not kill it.’ His energetic, inventive side bounded into a second-minute lead through Nacer Chadli, then allowed Sunderland to level just 74 seconds later.

Goals: Chadli (2), Eriksen (48) Referee: C Pawson (South Yorkshire) Early in the second half, Spurs again took a lead their dominance warranted, Christian Eriksen converting from close range. But another error, this time an own goal by substitute Harry Kane, gifted the hosts a point. Sunderland might have snatched all three in the final minute after a powerful run by Patrick van Aanholt set up Will Buckley in front of goal. But the 24-year-old smacked his effort over the bar, allowing Tottenham to head back south with a point — the least they deserved — and Sunderland still winless. Pochettino said: ‘I’m disappointed, my players too, because we played well, made chances. In other games you’ll have the chances that we had and win. ‘I’m not worried because the most important thing is to create the chances,’ he said. But frankly he looked a little bewildered. ‘We need to be more solid,’ he said. Then: ‘I need to analyse the first goal.’ Then: ‘We need to be more smart.’ As for Kane’s own goal, he said: ‘Unlucky. But that is football.’ The reaction of Gus Poyet said everything. Asked if he was happy with a point, he beamed and said: ‘I’m happy with that. It was our hardest game so far, against the best team we’ve played so far. It was a really, really hard day for us and that was a proper point.’ Sunderland’s three points from three draws against West Brom, Manchester United and Tottenham, plus a defeat at QPR, leave them 13th. Poyet says the elusive first win is best not even discussed with his players. ‘The more we talk about the win we cannot get, the more it becomes difficult,’ he said. He dropped Steven Fletcher — who did not even make the bench — and handed a debut to one of his deadline-day signings, Ricardo Alvarez. The 26-year-old Argentinian is on a one-year loan from Inter Milan and played a substitute’s role for his country last week as they drubbed Germany 4-2 in a friendly.

Alvarez began on the right of a four-man midfield and looked taken aback by the pace. Poyet switched him to the left, swapping with Adam Johnson, and he got more involved — but quickly looked tired. He was also clattered several times and went off in the second half. ‘A proper Premier League welcome,’ said Poyet with a wry smile. Tottenham could have led in the first minute, with Eriksen setting Danny Rose free down the left for a shot that required a decent stop from Vito Mannone. But they scored when Emmanuel Adebayor’s shot was parried by Mannone and Chadli was quickest to the rebound. At the other end Johnson cut in from the left, took on a defender and his shot went in off Kaboul. Adebayor and Chadli combined to set up Eriksen for Spurs’ second, assisted by a defensive mistake involving Van Aanholt and Wes Brown.

"They say a good referee should blend in to the extent that you barely know they're on the pitch. But UEFA may have taken that mantra a step too far, after their new Champions League kit received criticism on its first outing in the tournament. The new kit, a dark shirt, with pale grey shorts, appeared to clash with some of the teams on the opening day, particularly Arsenal in their away tie against Borussia Dortmund. UEFA referees were wearing the new Adidas kit in all of Tuesday night's Champions League games . Arsenal and the referee both wore dark shirts in Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Tuesday night . It was hard to spot which one was the referee at times during Arsenal's trip to Borussia Dortmund . The officials were dressed in all grey, with a darker shirt and pale shorts, prompting scorn on social media . The Gunners were wearing their third choice kit, with shirts, shorts and socks all dark blue, and this looked to be a little too close to the all-grey officials. Several time Arsenal players appeared to leave the ball to the referee at the Westfalenstadion, as the new Adidas strip caused confusion.","Officials wear new grey Adidas kit for first time in opening games .

"President Barack Obama dodged a question on Friday about whether American troops will be part of a new NATO rapid response force in Eastern Europe set up to warn Russia that Western nations could quickly mobilize if an allied country in the region were to come under attack. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the new unit would send a clear message to potential aggressors in a thinly veiled warning to Vladimir Putin. 'Should you even think of attacking one ally, you will be facing the whole alliance,' he declared as a two-day NATO summit in southern Wales drew to a close. But when Obama was asked point-blank if he will send troops, he talked only of financial assistance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama said Friday in Wales that the US will put part of a promised $1 billion outlay into helping NATO with its rapid-reaction force, but dodged a question about sending American troops to help . Tense: Ukrainian soldiers ride a tank as a ceasefire was drawn up with Russia and the NATO summit concluded Friday at the Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, Wales . Great Britain has signaled a desire to send 3,500 soldiers in total – a number PM David Cameron later downgraded to 1,000. Canada is reportedly considering the same level of commitment. 'In Warsaw,' Obama said during a press conference in Wales, 'I announced $1 billion in our initiative. A sizable portion of that will be devoted to implementing various aspects of this.' He discussed the need to support NATO's plan with logistical help to plan troop rotations and execute 'air policing,' saying money from Washington 'allows us to supplement it.' 'We want to make it crystal clear: We mean what we say when we talk about Article 5 commitments,' Obama pledged. During a press briefing on Tuesday, a State Department spokeswoman told reporters that she was 'not ruling anything in or out' on the question of U.S. troop deployments under NATO's banner for the new force. But the Associated Press wrote Wednesday that America 'will contribute troops and equipment' to the new NATO contingent. There was no confirmation of that report when NATO announced its rapid-response plan Friday. It no longer appears accurate. Rasmussen . said in a press release Friday that NATO would set up a command and . control presence and a location where allies can pre-position equipment, . supplies and planners. 'NATO . will step up intelligence sharing, upgrade defence plans and hold more . short-notice exercises as well,' the announcement stated. There . were no final decisions on where the forces would be based, but . Rasmussen said Poland, Romania and the Baltics have all indicated a . willingness to host the facilities. British . Prime Minister David Cameron said his nation is willing to contribute . 3,500 personnel to the rapid response force. He said its headquarters . could be in Poland, with forward units in the easternmost NATO member . countries and equipment stockpiled there in advance. 'We must be able to act more swiftly,' Cameron said. The summit coincided with the start of peace talks involving Ukraine, Russia and pro-Russian rebels that kicked off Friday in Minsk, Belarus. The talks are aimed at achieving a cease-fire to bring an end to the months of fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. The two signed an agreement on a ceasefire on Friday which is due to take effect later in the day. NATO's push to build a new rapid-reaction force signals growing impatience with Russia's incursion into Ukraine, and with that country's constant defensive military posture .

(left) during a military jet flyover at the NATO summit . Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko confirmed that envoys in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, signed theagreement. Rebels . announced the deal separately on Twitter. Despite the ceasefire, rebels . said they were still seeking separation from Kiev. While . Poroshenko voiced 'careful optimism' about the talks, Western leaders . remain skeptical. The U.S. and Europe have warned that they stand ready . to levy more economic sanctions on Russia, a step a top White House . official said could occur within days. The crisis in Ukraine has been among the most pressing issues on the agenda during the NATO meetings. While Ukraine is not part of the NATO alliance, Russia's actions have prompted fears among member countries in Central and Eastern Europe that the Kremlin could seek to make gains beyond their borders as well. Rasmussen said the high-readiness force would give NATO a 'continuous presence' in Eastern Europe, with alliance countries contributing forces on a rotational basis. Confronting another pressing international crisis, Rasmussen said NATO stands 'ready to help' Iraq fight back against a violent militant group, but noted that the Iraqi government has not made any such request. Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama have been pressing their NATO counterparts to join a coalition of nations that could degrade militants from the Islamic State group. In the two-day NATO summit, leaders discussed the situations in Ukraine and Afghanistan . The . threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) overshadowed some of the NATO summit's official agenda. Yet the leaders . still spent a considerable amount of their time discussing the crisis in . Ukraine, with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko taking on a . high-profile role during the talks. In . another signal of its commitment to protecting its members in Eastern . Europe, NATO announced that its next summit will be held in Warsaw, . Poland, in 2016. Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski praised the alliance's willingness to boost its presence in the region, calling it 'a matter of key importance to Poland's security.' 'There is progress in raising NATO combat readiness,' Komorowski told reporters. He said the rapid response force would comprise up to 5,000 troops, with its command stationed in Poland. On the sidelines of the summit, Cameron and Obama were also meeting with their counterparts to rally support for a mission to confront the Islamic State through military might, diplomatic efforts and economic penalties. Both leaders had meetings planned Friday with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a key regional player whose support would be crucial to defeating the militants. Obama also met Friday morning with French President Francois Hollande. Rasmussen suggested that NATO was unlikely to take imminent military action against the militants in Iraq, but said he could foresee the alliance engaging in a 'defense capacity-building mission' there. The U.S. is already launching airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq, and Britain has joined up for humanitarian aid drops to besieged minority groups. Obama is weighing whether to extend the military mission into neighboring Syria, where the extremists have establisheed a safe haven. On other fronts, alliance leaders pressed NATO countries to follow through on commitments to spend 2 percent of their nations' gross domestic product on defense. Only four NATO nations meet that threshold: the U.S., Britain, Greece and Estonia. Komorowski said that Poland would raise its defense budget to 2 percent of GDP in 2016 and would encourage other members to increase defense spending as well.","Quick-reaction force falls short of the permanent NATO bases Poland and other eastern countries wanted .

"Manchester United are on the verge of sealing the sensational transfer of Argentinian winger Angel Di Maria for £60 million — a record fee paid by a British club. United have been working on a deal for the Real Madrid star for the past month and Sportsmail revealed last Monday that they have offered him a £200,000-a-week incentivised package to compensate for the fact that they cannot offer him Champions League football this season. In addition to the fee, it is believed there are add-ons which amount to another £8m. Now it is understood Di Maria has told United he will come and Old Trafford sources indicated that the club was making progress in terms of agreeing a fee with Madrid.

Ironically, it is understood that in the past week, Manchester City were asked by Di Maria’s representatives to join in the bidding for him but City declined.

"A mother was left with a suspected broken neck after knocking herself unconscious while doing the ice bucket challenge. Amanda Davey, 40, from Southport, asked her mother Irene Vitali to drench her with the iced water as part of the latest craze sweeping the internet. After receiving a soaking, Ms Davey raced into the kitchen to dry herself off, shrieking from the shock of the freezing water. Scroll down for video . Amanda Davey, 40, pictured sitting in the chair left and right, asked her mother Irene to pour a bucket of freezing water over her as part of the ice bucket challenge . During the 57-second clip, Ms Davey is seen shrieking as the water is poured over her, left, before racing inside to get herself dry, pictured right . But the beauty therapist slipped on the tiled floor, banging her head and knocking herself unconscious. Once she came around, her speech was slurred - and doctors suspected she could have a broken neck. Ms Davey was later diagnosed with severe whiplash and bruising . The 53-second clip of the fall has now become an online hit, receiving more than 1,500 likes on the Facebook page 'Ice bucket challenge fails'. Ms Davey said: 'My legs just went from under me and I was knocked out for a few seconds. When I opened my eyes my mum was asking if I was OK. 'I had pins and needles all down my arms and when I went to speak slurred words came out. I had only had half a glass of wine, so I know it wasn't that. 'I knew I had really banged my head, I had a huge bump and my scalp was black, blue and purple.' Ms Davey tried to take the swelling down with frozen vegetables. But when she woke up in agony and unable to turn her neck, she decided to go to A&E. She said: 'The hospital thought I might have broken my neck and I was there for three hours but the doctor said I had been very lucky and only had severe whiplash. But as she runs into the kitchen, Ms Davey slips on the kitchen floor - leaving her with severe whiplash which doctors initially thought was a broken neck . 'In hospital they told me they had had a few people come in who had slipped and banged themselves.' She added: 'It wasn't funny at the time but it is really funny to watch, you can't help but laugh. I would do it again – but without the fall. 'So many people were telling me when I posted it that it was the best one yet. Then they were asking me if I was ok.' Ms Davey is advising other participants not to run after the challenge before getting dry. She said: 'You tell kids at swimming pools when they are little not to run as they will slip. But when you are freezing cold you don't think about it. 'My boys saw the video and thought it was hilarious, they were not even remotely concerned that I had hurt myself. 'I went with a bang, but I am here to tell the tale. My advice to those doing it is don't run anywhere. Stand and take it and get dried first.' The challenge, which has raised millions for charity, involves participants pouring a bucket of freezing water over their heads.","Amanda Davey's mother Irene poured water over her in garden in Southport .

"Leeds owner Massimo Cellino will be forced to sell his controlling stake in the club if an Italian judge rules that his recent tax evasion conviction was an act of 'dishonesty'. Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey said the long wait for the full written judgment on Cellino's conviction for failing to pay tax on his yacht was 'a cloud still hanging over the Football League and the club and Mr Cellino himself'. Cellino was found guilty of tax evasion in March but following an appeal was allowed to complete his takeover at Elland Road because the Italian court had not confirmed whether it felt the offence had been a 'dishonest act'. Massimo Cellini could be forced to sell Leeds if Italian judge rules his tax evasion to be 'dishonest' The Italian judge in the initial case will confirm this in her full written report, which had been expected in June. The League had no option but to allow Cellino to complete his takeover in April, but Harvey, former chief executive at Leeds, said the Italian could yet fail its owners' and directors' test. 'It's exceptionally disappointing that we haven't actually had the judgment, if only to draw a line under the whole scenario so that everyone knows where they are,' Harvey told the Guardian. 'It's a cloud still hanging over the Football League and the club and Mr Cellino himself. 'The actual single arbiter in the matter (the Football League) made it very clear that when the written reasons are issued as part of the judicial process, if it is clear in there that the act was one of dishonesty, which is the test that we apply, then at that stage he would fail the owners' and directors' test and as such wouldn't be able to be a director of the football club or exert any control. Both Robbie Fowler and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink have said they would like to be manager of Leeds . 'He is under an obligation to divest himself of his shares at that stage. 'From our perspective he then fails the owners' and directors' test and at that stage the provisions are in the rules that he has to divest himself of his interests. 'We'd obviously give the club a reasonable period of time to organise its affairs because you wouldn't want to put the future of the club at risk immediately that you had a decision. 'It's a matter the Football League board would have to consider at that particular time.' The publication of the Italian judgment has been repeatedly delayed and Harvey added: 'We are constantly monitoring it. 'We have been asked to be kept informed. Our influence over the judicial system in Italy is somewhat limited. 'We have Italian lawyers monitoring it for us and we've been told it will come out when it comes out. That's how the Italian judicial system has been described to us.'

"She can hardly be blamed for keeping quiet since filing for divorce from Charles Saatchi earlier this year. But what is perhaps surprising is how Nigella Lawson has chosen to break her silence – by blaming the feminist revolution for giving women a ‘sense of dread in the kitchen’. The unexpected outburst was made as the food writer, 53, gave an interview to a Sunday newspaper. Outburst: Nigella Lawson (pictured in a publicity photograph for her 2012 BBC TV show Nigellissima) has blamed the feminist revolution for giving women a 'sense of dread in the kitchen' She said she was ‘baffled’ to be asked if she considers herself a feminist, adding that it should be ‘self-evident’ that she is. And despite forging a successful career based around being a ‘domestic goddess’ she said she recognised a reluctance among women to be ‘tied to the stove’. Miss Lawson said: ‘Feeling comfortable in the kitchen is essential for everyone, male or female. At the time it seemed so many people were fearful of cooking, and that meant home was never more than a stop-off from work. ‘Women of my generation were keen - rightly - not to be tied to the stove, but the ramifications of this were that they felt a sense of dread in the kitchen. How can this be good for anyone? ‘I also feel that to denigrate any activity because it has traditionally been associated with the female sphere is in itself anti-feminist.’ Miss Lawson, who is filming a British version of her American cookery programme The Taste, made her name as the author of several best-selling cookbooks, including How To Be A Domestic Goddess, published in 2000. In the past she has defended the book against critics, saying it should be seen as a ‘feminist tract’ that celebrates women. Ex-couple: Miss Lawson had been keeping quiet since filing for divorce from Charles Saatchi earlier this year . And as she spoke to The Observer’s Food Monthly magazine, in an edition to mark the nominees of its Chef of the  Decade award, she addressed the issue once more. She said: ‘When I wrote How to Be A Domestic Goddess, many felt I was saying that women’s place was in the kitchen, but the ironic pictures on the end papers (showing a Fifties housewife) surely undermined that, except for those people who consciously chose to misread my intent.’ 'Women of my generation were keen - rightly - not to be tied to the stove, but the ramifications of this were that they felt a sense of dread in the kitchen. How can this be good for anyone?' Nigella Lawson . Miss Lawson’s comments come after she returned to London from Los Angeles, where she was filming for The Taste. She is said to be looking for a property in North London, after moving out of the marital home she shared with Mr Saatchi. Miss Lawson, who began her career as a journalist, also said she thinks readers can relate to her because she doesn’t label herself a chef. She said: ‘I am not a chef; I am not even a trained cook. So yes, I do think the fact that I am a bit of a kitchen klutz, and fit cooking into an already busy life (and I started writing food books when I was a non-food columnist with young children) means that I cook in much the same way as my readers, or viewers. ‘Real cooking, the sort that goes on in homes, does not have to be tricky or difficult and I felt it was important to demonstrate that.’","Outburst by chef who filed for divorce from Charles Saatchi earlier this year .

"Zinedine Zidane could be banned from coaching for six months if found guilty of managing Real Madrid’s B-team without the correct license. Spain’s national association of coaches CENAFE made a complaint about the former World Cup winner at the start of the season and now the country’s Competitions Committee is studying the possibility that Real Madrid have broken rule 104 of their code which could lead to a ban of between four and 16 games or one to six months. Real Madrid Castilla – as the B-team is known – have claimed that Sergio Sanchez is the first coach and Zidane only his number two. But the Frenchman’s accusers have presented documental and video evidence to suggest that this is not the case and that the former Real Madrid player is carrying out the work of the first coach. Real Madrid B coach Zinedine Zidane could face a ban  if found guilty of managing without the correct license . Zidane attends the Predator Arena tournament in Arles, Southern France earlier this week . First coaches in Spain need to have a level 3 national coaching diploma and Zidane, who this week admitted he would one day like to coach the French national team, is still to obtain the relevant qualification.

"Jose Mourinho has confirmed Diego Costa will be fit to lead the line at Manchester City on Sunday but will be rested against Bolton in the Capital One Cup. Costa is nursing a hamstring problem which needs rest and not in the top condition, according to the manager. When asked about his squad's fitness ahead of the trip to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, Mourinho said: 'Everybody’s ready. Diego (Costa) is not in the best condition but he will start. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini: I am not surprised about Diego Costa . Chelsea striker Diego Costa, put through his paces in training on Friday, will start for the Blues on Sunday . Diego Costa, who has scored seven this season, will start against Manchester City confirms Jose Mourinho . Mourinho revealed that striker Costa will then be rested midweek against Bolton Wanderers . Diego Costa (left) was left on the bench against Schalke on Wednesday due to recurring hamstring problems . Costa was fit enough to train on Friday  as Mourinho claims the striker 'is not in the best condition' 'He plays this game but he cannot play against Bolton, as simple as that. He plays Sunday and not against Bolton, then he plays against Aston Villa. 'That’s his evolution. Let’s hope he goes in the right direction and becomes available for every game. 'Last season he was at Atletico Madrid, this season the problem was in the national team but I don’t want to speak about it. The player is fantastic in his amazing attitude to play. 'I know what we have and clearly that we have to protect him until he gets completely fit.' Mourinho talks to his backroom staff as he prepares his side to face Manchester City on Sunday . Blues striker Didier Drogba jumps in to block a pass during Chelsea training before the trip to the Etihad . Diego Costa (right) scored a hat-trick against Swansea and has seven in five matches this season . Jose Mourinho (pictured) masterminded a Chelsea victory against Man City at the Etihad Stadium last season . Sunday's match also raises the possibility of Frank Lampard facing the Blues for the first time since leaving this summer. And Mourinho insists it is not 'strange' that Lampard is now at City but he would not have foreseen the move just months ago. 'It’s football - not strange,' he said. Frank Lampard could make his first appearance against Chelsea since leaving the club this summer . Mourinho says it will not be 'strange' to face Lampard but he did not envisage the midfielder going to City . 'I wouldn’t have imagined that. Even a few months ago when he signed for the New York (City) team, I wasn’t expecting that. But it’s his decision. 'When he left for New York I thought he was going to New York but it is his life and his decision and he has my respect for that.' The magnitude of the match has not escaped Mourinho either, although he was keen to play down the importance of just one fixture. The midfielder left Chelsea at the start of the summer and moved to the Etihad on loan from New York City . Mourinho says his 'job is easier' against bigger teams because he does not have to motivate the players . He continued: 'It’s always a good time to play the big teams. Against the big teams my job is easier. 'It's one more game, three more points - but obviously when matches are between title contenders every point makes a difference. 'Arsenal and City got one point each (last week) which means nobody got three. 'These matches can be important but in a simple and pragmatic point of view it’s one game, three points and no more. 'We don’t play against just them. We play against another 19 teams. It’s not just City for the title. This is not a situation of Chelsea or City. Summer signing Loic Remy gets ready for the City clash having scored last weekend in the win over Swansea . Chelsea's full-back Cesar Azpilicueta slides in on Andre Schurrle during training in Cobham on Friday . Branislav Ivanovic (left) scored the only goal of the game as Chelsea beat City at the Etihad last season . Mourinho, here pictured on the touchline at the Etihad, masterminded the win but says that is in the past . 'Last season we had the experience and we know what it’s like to win and lose there (at the Etihad). 'Statistics belong to history not to the future. Can we go there and win? Obviously we can. Can we lose? We also can.' Chelsea finished third in the Premier League last season but strengthened their squad with the signings of Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis and Loic Remy this summer. Eden Hazard (left) is another of Chelsea's players who will be expected to put in a big performance at City . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry (second right) are part of a settled Chelsea defence but they have let in seven . And Mourinho thinks that he has a more competitive group of players to choose from than in the last campaign and that they can challenge the champions. 'I don’t want to compare,' he said. 'Our squad is better than last season. We have more solutions. 'We have players with qualities we didn’t have and feel our squad - although very short only 21 players - we have a good balance and we are happy. We don’t compare ourselves with others.' Cesc Fabregas, here celebrating scoring against Schalke, has been excellent for Chelsea so far this season . Fabregas has starred so far this season and the Portuguese explained he knew just how good a player he was signing when the Spaniard move from Barcelona this summer. He explained: 'I know the qualities (Fabregas has). Age, experience, tactical culture, made in England - in the PL. He had no need to learn philosophies and feelings. 'The team was waiting for a player of his dimension. I was expecting him to play the way he’s been playing.' Fabregas celebrates his goal to put Chelsea 1-0 up on Wednesday night and Mourinho says he has 'qualities' When asked about how he felt after Wembley was awarded the right to host the 2020 European Championship final, Mourinho revealed his delight. He said: 'It's great. It has to be a special Euro with playing in so many countries but ending in London at Wembley is fantastic news. 'I'd like to be there as a fan - not as a manager.'

"Manchester City and Chelsea face off in a mammoth match between the Premier League champions and title favourites this weekend. Given the Blues’ perfect start, this is already a must-win for holders City if they’re to reclaim ground lost by defeat by Stoke and a draw at Arsenal. But Jose Mourinho’s side – inspired by Diego Costa – are in rampant domestic form and it promises to be a scintillating showdown. Here, Sportsmail plays judge and jury as we return our High Court verdict on those in the dock this Sunday… . Sergio Aguero, with three Premier League goals already this season, will be a threat for Manchester City . Diego Costa's blistering start to life in English football has propelled Chelsea to the top of the table . MANCHESTER CITY . Joe Hart – Comes into the game buoyed by his heroics in Munich, albeit them ultimately being in vain. Still arguably the best goalkeeper in the league, although the man at the opposite end of the park on Sunday could soon be challenging him for that title. Sportsmail rating: 8.5/10 . Joe Hart was beaten by a late winner against Bayern Munich but had a very good match . Pablo Zabaleta – Back in the side after missing Munich and his energy and endeavour down that right flank will make a huge difference. Best right-back in the division. Rating: 8.5/10 . Pablo Zabaleta is a rock at the back for Man City . Martin Demichelis – It says something for the improved form of the much-maligned Argentine that new £32m signing Eliaquim Mangala isn’t getting a look in. Less conspicuous with shorter hair. Rating: 6.5/10 . Martin Demichelis (right) is one of Man City's most improved players . Vincent Kompany – If Hart and Zabaleta are up there with the best in the league in their position, the captain is up there among the best in the world. The ultimate leader of a defence and, indeed, team. Kompany versus Costa could be one hell of a battle. Rating: 9/10 . Skipper Vincent Kompany is the rock at the heart of the champions' defence . Aleksandar Kolarov – Likely to return to starting XI and he’ll have a point to prove having last started in the 1-0 home defeat by Stoke. Could have Eden Hazard to contend with if the Belgian pulls right. Rating: 7/10 . Man City left-back Alexsander Kolarov prepares to swing a cross in . Fernandinho – Will do for City what Matic does for Chelsea, anchoring the midfield with minimum fuss but maximum effect. Rating: 8.5/10 . Fernandinho goes about his work with the minimum of fuss - but maximum efficiency . Yaya Toure – A big game for the midfielder given the criticism he received in the wake of his casual performance against Bayern. Former City star Didi Hamann called him a ‘liability’ last season and was shot down – perhaps the German had a point after all. Rating: 8/10 . Powerhouse midfielder Yaya Toure disappointed against Bayern . VIDEO We must support Toure - Pellegrini . James Milner – Enjoying a decent run of form and will provide the graft rather than the craft in City’s attacking midfield. Rating: 7/10 . James Milner's hard graft will be a crucial asset against Chelsea . David Silva – The main man for City right now, his cunning will be crucial in unpicking Chelsea’s backline. Rating: 9/10 . David Silva - the main man for Man City in the early stages of the season . Samir Nasri – Didn’t enjoy his best night against Bayern but remains a player capable of making the difference on an occasion such as this. More needed, though. Rating: 7.5/10 . Samir Nasri is another player with a point to prove after a poor performance in Munich . Sergio Aguero – Only a substitute in Munich, he will return to lead the line and, with three goals from four in the league, Chelsea will have to be on their guard against the fit-again forward. Rating: 8.5/10 . Sergio Aguero is expected to lead the line for Man City . CHELSEA . Thibaut Courtois – Has made an impressive start to life in the Premier League but won’t be happy with six conceded in the last three. Rating: 8/10 . Thibaut Courtois had had an impressive start to Chelsea - but has only kept one clean sheet . Branislav Ivanovic – Arguably Chelsea’s best player this season – Costa apart. He will thrive in the high-stakes environment of Sunday. Rating: 8.5/10 . Branislav Ivanovic (right) has been his usual dependable self for Chelsea so far this season . Gary Cahill – Didn’t enjoy a great night against Schalke but has matured into a top centre back for club and country in recent seasons. Aguero could prove a handful, though. Rating: 8/10 . Gary Cahill, getting up close and personal with Swansea's Bafetimbi Gomis, has matured into a top defender . John Terry – Like Cahill, will want to bounce back from Schalke disappointment and he’ll rise to this occasion. Still one of best at his trade despite advancing years. Rating: 8/10 . John Terry is still going strong despite his advancing years . Cesar Azpilicueta – Will keep new boy Filipe Luis out of the side and the Spaniard remains one of Mourinho’s favourites for his reliability. Rating: 7/10 . Cesar Azpilicueta's dependability is keeping new boy Filipe Luis out of the team . Nemanja Matic – Continues to grow in influence and stature and is just about one of the first names on the team-sheet. He’ll be responsible for patrolling the domain populated by the likes of Silva and Nasri. Rating: 8.5/10 . Nemanja Matic has become a key player for Chelsea since re-signing in January . Ramires – Still to rediscover top form of a couple of seasons back but his energy will be key on Sunday in a game that is sure to be decided in the midfield. Rating: 7.5/10 . The energy of Ramires will be a key component of Sunday's crunch clash . Cesc Fabregas – What a reintroduction to the Premier League. The Spaniard having been sensational this season. But this is his first big test and a lot is expected. Rating: 8.5/10 . Cesc Fabregas scored his first goal for Chelsea against Schalke in midweek . Andre Schurrle – Has played his way into Mourinho’s XI but is yet to finish a game this season. The German needs to return more goals if he’s to keep his place in the side. Rating: 7/10 . Andre Schurrle needs to add more goals to his game to keep his place in the Chelsea team . Eden Hazard – Another season of improvement is expected and the early evidence suggests the Belgian could again take his game to another level. Rating: 9/10 . Eden Hazard has had a strong start to the season and is Chelsea's man with the magic feet . Diego Costa – The Premier League’s best player so far this season with seven goals from four matches. There may be question marks over his fitness but the Spaniard would still score goals on one leg! Rating: 9.5/10 . Diego Costa celebrating has become a familiar site for Chelsea fans already . VERDICT: City 88 Chelsea 88.5 – What does that tell you? There’s almost nothing to separate the title contenders and our trial by numbers only has Chelsea marginally in front. But it is, of course, the small margins which make the difference in these mammoth games.","Manchester City and Chelsea meet at the Etihad on Sunday in a huge clash between the Premier League title favourites .

"The first Briton known to have caught the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa was discharged from hospital today and joked he won't be going back because his passport has been incinerated. William Pooley, 29, a  volunteer nurse, was flown back to the UK for treatment on August 24 after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone. He was then rushed across London to the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead Heath where he was put in an isolation ward and treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. Asked whether he would be returning to Africa, he said he currently had no plans to do so, adding: 'They incinerated my passport so my mum will be pleased to know I cannot go anywhere at the moment.' Despite the grave dangers, Mr Pooley had selflessly volunteered to serve in a makeshift clinic where other nurses had died from ebola or were too scared to come into work. Scroll down for video . Ebola sufferer William Pooley, who comes from the small village of Eyke in Suffolk, has been discharged from the Royal Free Hospital in London . Discharged: Mr Pooley, who comes from the small village of Eyke in Suffolk, was airlifted back to Britain in a specially equipped C17 RAF aircraft . William Pooley, a volunteer nurse, was being cared for at a special unit at the Royal Free Hospital . Speaking today he described being in the isolation unit as 'like being in a fishtank' and said it was so busy in hospital he 'didn't have much time to ponder the full potential of the illness'. Mr Pooley also praised the 'world-class care' he had received at the hospital and thanked the Government and RAF for getting him home so quickly. He said he had feared for his life after being diagnosed with the virus and woken by doctors in protective clothing. 'I was worried I was going to die,' Mr Pooley said. He said: 'I was very lucky in several ways, firstly in the standard of care that I received, which is a world apart from what people are receiving in west Africa, despite various organisations' best efforts. 'I had amazing care, which was one difference. The other difference is that my symptoms never progressed to the worst stage of the disease - people I have seen dying horrible deaths. William Pooley arrives home in Eyke, Suffolk after being discharged from the isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London . William Pooley in his blue scrubs (centre) working in Freetown, Sierra Leone, before he caught ebola virus . Victim: Volunteer William Pooley is believed to have contracted virus from one-year-old boy . Africa is facing the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago . 'I had some unpleasant symptoms but nothing compared to some of the worst of the disease, especially when people are dying.' He did not even vomit, he said, but had suffered high temperatures and some stomach problems. Mr Pooley said he had no regrets about his decision to go to help people stricken with the deadly virus in west Africa, which is in the middle of a horrific epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people. He said: 'I have mixed memories, some great memories and some horrible memories - lots of people dying. ZMapp is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus. Two US doctors given the drug after they were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia subsequently recovered. But it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or just lucky. About 45% of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. At least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late. However, it remains to be seen how quickly production of the drug can be geared up to meet future demand. ZMapp, developed by US biotech company Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc, is manufactured in the leaves of genetically modified tobacco plants. Potentially the process could yield 20 to 40 doses per month, said Dr Kobinger. Evidence suggests that effective treatment with ZMapp requires three doses of 15 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. 'But also some wonderful memories of people going home, people showing massive spirit and cheer, despite the horrible conditions, the truly heroic people that I worked with, people that went on to get sick, so it is a massive mix of memories.' Mr Pooley said he had undergone blood tests after feeling ill in Sierra Leone. He told how he went to bed feeling sick and was woken by a World Health Organisation doctor in personal protective equipment (PPE) - a protective suit - after the tests came back positive. 'He was in PPE so I knew it was bad news,' Mr Pooley said. 'It was a bit disturbing to get that diagnosis but I had been half expecting it because I had been feeling sick.' He added: 'I was worried about my family, I was scared.' Mr Pooley said coming out of the isolation tent at the hospital had been a 'special moment'. He said he would be heading home to East Anglia to recuperate with friends and family after being discharged. Infectious diseases consultant Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated Mr Pooley, said he posed no contagion risk to members of the public. He was being cared for at a special unit at the Royal Free but today the hospital announced he was discharged. The drug he was given, ZMapp, was first given last month to two US aid workers, who were flown home for treatment from Liberia. Mr Pooley, who comes from the small village of Eyke in Suffolk, was airlifted back to Britain in a specially equipped C17 RAF aircraft. The hospital said in a statement: 'Following 10 days of successful treatment in the high level isolation unit - the only one in the UK - Mr Pooley is being discharged from the Royal Free Hospital today.' Close to 1,500 people have so far died across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the worst epidemic since the disease was first identified 38 years ago. Mr Pooley had been volunteering at the ebola centre in Kenema, one of the worst affected areas, for just five weeks when he fell ill. Previously he had been providing palliative care to patients at the Shepherd's Hospice in Sierra Leone's capital city, Freetown, and had been there since March. But as the ebola epidemic began and he heard that healthcare professionals were fleeing for fear of catching the disease, he decided to go to Kenema. Mr Pooley is the only Briton to be have ever been infected by ebola outside the laboratory. The only other British case was in 1976, when scientist Geoffrey Platt pricked himself with a needle contaminated with the virus.

"Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is confident his side can beat Arsenal this weekend to get their title challenge back on course. City lost their last game before the international break 1-0 to Stoke, and want to send a strong message to their title rivals by beating Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. And Dzeko believes his side can take the initiative against a club he believes can challenge for the title. Title challenge: Dzeko knows that there will be several teams hoping to knock City off top spot . Best year: Dzeko (right) during City's trophy parade, after a season which he described as his best yet . '[The Arsenal game] will be difficult but I'm an optimist,' he told the Manchester City official website. 'This season Chelsea might be the most serious challenger but we mustn't ignore Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal, or [Manchester] United, who will certainly be much stronger than last year. After all, everyone has got stronger and everyone wants to be first.' Dzeko was a key part of City's title winning squad last season, and committed to a new four-year contract over the summer. 'The past season was one of the best in my career, and in the end we reached the title of champions of England, the second in the past three seasons,' the 28-year old said.

'We succeeded in winning the Capital One Cup and I am really happy how everything played out in the past season, both for the club and for myself. 'As far as the contract, in general I had no dilemma around an extension.

"Tottenham defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been hit with a three match ban and £50,000 fine for backing Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' celebration last season. With the gesture known to have anti-Semitic connotations, the punishment is particularly embarrassing for the Cameroon star given Spurs' strong Jewish heritage. Anelka, playing for West Brom at the time, made the gesture having scored against West Ham on December 28 - with the Baggies sacking the striker following their own internal investigation. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been hit with three-game ban by the Football Association and fined £50,000 . Nicolas Anelka was hit with an £80,000 fine and banned for five matches following his 'quenelle' gesture . Assou-Ekotto was charged by the FA after sending a tweet to Anelka congratulating him on the gesture and, despite the 30-year-old's denial of wrongdoing, has been punished. The left-back insisted he was congratulating Anelka from an anti-establishment viewpoint. And Mr Peter Griffiths QC, the chairman of the Independent Regulatory Commission that heard Assou-Ekotto's concurred, saying: 'Even though we have found that there was an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 we are satisfied that when the Player sent the tweet on the 28th December 2013 congratulating Anelka, in his mind he believed he was congratulating Anelka on what he perceived to be an anti-establishment gesture as opposed to one associated with anti-Semitism.' In a statement from Assou-Ekotto, he added: 'I am obviously very pleased that the FA has accepted I am not an anti-Semite. I have always said that when I tweeted Nicholas Anelka I was congratulating him on an anti-establishment gesture and NOT on an anti-Semitic gesture. 'The finding against me was that I breached the FA's rules but that my breach was unintentional. I have always loved the fans of Spurs and I want to assure them that I would never knowingly behave in a racist or anti-Semitic manner.' Meanwhile, UEFA have launched a formal investigation into the anti-Semitic banner that overshadowed Tottenham's 0-0 draw against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday night. Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho, playing against Ludogorets, escaped with a warnings for a similar incident . A banner that read: 'Only Jews and Pussies' - a play on comedy show Only Fools and Horses - was on display amongst Partizan fans. The banner was included in Israeli referee Alon Yevet's and the UEFA match delegate's reports on Friday morning. Sportsmail understands Partizan officials were made aware of the banner by UEFA officials during the game, but the Serbian club's failure to act is believed to have angered European football's governing body. UEFA are also concerned at how the large banner was allowed to be taken into the stadium by home supporters. It now looks highly likely Partizan will face punishment from UEFA, with a partial ground closure for their next Europa League home clash and fine a possible sanction. The matter will be decided by UEFA's disciplinary committee during their next meeting on October 16. Hull's Yannick Sagbo served a two-game ban and was fined £15,000 having also given his support to Anelka . Partizan moved quickly to apologise for the offensive banner with a statement, that read: 'The football match between Partizan and Tottenham was eagerly awaited in our city and we watched fine performances from both teams in a fair-play sporting atmosphere. 'But this game was marred by malicious act of certain individuals who made all the efforts from our players and our club to prove we deserve our spot in football Europe worthless. 'FC Partizan resolutely disavows with anti-Semitic banner displayed yesterday. The message displayed on that banner is completely opposite to preferences and opinions of almost all citizens of Serbia and Partizan fans. 'It is absolutely absurd to link a club that was founded after the WWII on anti-fascist principles and after the battle of people of Europe with anti-Semitism and similar dark and anti-civilisation impulses. 'We fully condemn perpetrators of this mindless act, not only of anti-Semitic nature, but one that represents hatred of Partizan and Serbia as well. ""We believe this vicious action will not spoil our sporting friendship with Tottenham and football aficionados in Great Britain. In cooperation with competent authorities, Partizan FC will do everything to locate, trial and ban those perpetrators from sporting fields. 'We apologise to everyone who found themselves insulted and upset by this banner. Once again, we point out that such banner message is completely opposite to history and tradition of our club, and our fans' aspirations.'","Assou-Ekotto sent the message to Anelka on December 29 following his celebration after scoring against West Ham .

Assou-Ekotto deleted the tweet which was written in French slang .

Now, in a further twist, it has emerged that it was Prince’s Lancashire team-mate Usman Khawaja who reported the incident to umpires Steve Garrett and Steve O’Shaugnessy rather than the South African. Khawaja, Lancashire’s Australian overseas player, was batting at the time with Prince and, Sportsmail can reveal, was the leading figure in taking the case further than the Level Two charge originally brought by the umpires for dissent. It was taken up by Alan Fordham, who is charge of discipline in the professional game for the ECB, and Gale’s future will this week be determined by a disciplinary commission chaired by the respected Gerard Elias QC. Prince's Lancashire team-mate Usman Khawaja was the one who reported the racist slur, it has emerged . Gale parades the County Championship trophy at the Leeds United vs Huddersfield Town match on Saturday . It was Elias who decided that Gale had a case to answer on racial grounds because he used what is considered the inflammatory phrase ‘f*** off back to your own country.’ The use of the term Kolpak, an overseas player who can play without restriction like Prince, bears no part in the hearing and is not considered insulting. Sportsmail understands that Gale has not helped his case by showing no contrition and there has been no sign of any apology either from Yorkshire, who have vowed to back their man to the hilt legally if necessary. Yet with Gale, 30, being a serial offender in dissent cases he could be facing a long spell on the sidelines if found guilty by Elias and his commission this week.","Andrew Gale faces a lengthy ban for racist outburst at Ashwell Prince .

"Sometime late on Saturday night, Floyd Mayweather will walk out into the great boxing amphitheatre that is the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for his hotly-anticipated rematch with Marcos Maidana. The fighter is perfectly familiar with these surroundings - his last nine contests have been in that famous ring - but he will still feel that frisson of excitement and adrenaline that comes with placing your unbeaten record and titles on the line. But Mayweather will face the blinding flashbulbs, riotous noise and his Argentinian opponent safe in the knowledge that, whatever fate awaits him over the 12 rounds, his financial position and ""Money"" monicker are secure. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Floyd Mayweather and Marcos Maidana square up before bout . Floyd Mayweather can look forward to another big pay-day when he takes on Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas this Saturday. The fighter, unbeaten in 46 contests, has estimated career earnings of £250m .

Their friendship emphasises the showbiz sparkle that Mayweather brings to all of his fights . For the fight itself is simply the culmination of a thorough and well-practised 12-week process put into action by his company Mayweather Promotions every time he fancies stepping in the ring. As explored recently by the Bleacher Report, they have a successful formula that is pretty much unique in boxing and sport, one that reduces the risk to Mayweather and his finances to the absolute minimum. Little wonder, then, that ""Money"" is the highest paid athlete in the world, according to Forbes, and is currently half-way through a remarkable pay TV deal that will pocket him a jaw-dropping $250m (£154m). His career earnings are estimated at about £250m, with a further £30m to come by the end of the weekend. Saturday's bout with Maidana, in which Mayweather will defend his WBA, WBC and The Ring welterweight and his WBC Light Middleweight titles, could be one of his last.

Floyd Mayweather poses with his WBC Welterweight title belt after defeating Robert Guerrero in 2013 . The 37-year-old hinted this week that he will hang up his gloves next year after a maximum of three more fights. Maidana comes first, following by two more against 'exciting' opponents. The split-decision victory over Maidana back in May took his record to 46-0. If all goes to plan, he'll retire on 49-0 and won't be short of a pension. His victories in the ring rely on brute strength but Mayweather has also shown brains in engineering a marketing strategy that ensures he controls every aspect of fight night. First, he decides on the opponent alongside his trusted advisers, Leonard Ellerbe, the chief executive of Mayweather Promotions, and Al Haymon, long-standing business associate of Mayweather. The amount paid to the opponents depends but the general range is between $1.5m (£900,000) and $4m (£2.4m). It appears a pittance compared to the vast sums Mayweather rakes in, but then he is the champ. The profile of the opponent dictates the number of pay-per-view (PPV) sales, which cost $65 ($40) a time for standard definition and $75 (£46) for high definition on the Showtime network. A pair of cheques worth $72,276,000 (£44.45m) paid by Oscar de la Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions to Mayweather Promotions, as posted on Floyd Mayweather's Twitter account .

Mayweather's white fleet of sports cars outside his boxing club in Las Vegas . The number of sales hovers between one million for a lesser fight and two million for blockbusters like this Saturday's. Mayweather was smart and realised the potential of PPV early on, leading to the $250m+ tie-in with Showtime to screen his final six fights. When in negotiations, Mayweather held all the aces - he was already a box office name and his only obligation to the network was to turn up for the fight. It falls to Showtime to brand and market the fight in the most effective way. They shoulder the burden and the risk; Mayweather's money is already in the bank. Overseas PPV deals, such as the one with BoxNation in the UK, coin in another $2m (£1.2m), while news channels seeking highlights and sports networks wanting delayed coverage all pay a premium. It will cost Mayweather's company, in collaboration with Golden Boy Promotions, started by Oscar de la Hoya, up to $3m (£1.8m) to assemble an undercard, but that is paid for by selling sponsorship opportunities at ringside.

Mayweather makes himself at home in the Presidential Suite of the 6* Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo . Then comes arranging the venue. This is pretty straightforward. The MGM Grand has its reputation as the world's leading boxing venue to uphold - they love the prestige, glamour and the packed house. So much so that they buy up 3,500 of the best seats and give the revenue - about $3.5m (£2.15m) - to Mayweather. After all, he could easily take his circus down the road. Mayweather's people then oversee the coast-to-coast publicity tours and press conferences, the ubiquitous promotion and marketing, and the popular Access all Areas TV spin-off. He is also adept at harnessing the power of social media. Mayweather is an avid tweeter and posts regularly on Instagram. These platforms not only give fans a tantalising glimpse into his habits and training regime but also help to perpetuate the 'Money' legend, cementing his 'top-of-the-bill' status. Mayweather is not shy in flaunting his vast wealth. One Instagram video clip saw Jessi Lee and Doralie Medina, two members of 'The Money Team' (TMT), playing a game to see which could count out $100,000 the fastest while Mayweather time them with a luxury watch.

Mayweather said the contents of this watch case totalled $6.4m (£3.9m) The fighter's fleet of cars is colour-coded depending upon which city he happens to be in - white for Vegas, black for Miami. His collection of expensive timepieces is something akin to an obsession. Mayweather splashed out $1m on one cut from 60 carat Russian diamonds by New York-based Rafaello and Co. For good measure, he patented the design to ensure he earns a tidy commission on any replicas. During a publicity tour last year, Mayweather flew around on his own private plane, a Gulfstream V, which costs about $10m (£6.15m) second hand, while his 20-strong entourage travelled on another jet. When out of the ring, the vast majority of Mayweather's life is played out on a whim. He usually carries about £40,000 cash in his pocket, or troubles one of his assistants to lug around a sports bag containing as much as £750,000. His vast fortune means he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants and, with another superfight on the agenda this week, he's showing no signs of slowing down.","Floyd Mayweather puts title belts and unbeaten 46-0 record on the line when he fights Marcos Maidana for second time on Saturday .

"Taking a stand: Coca-Cola has promised to reduce levels of 4-MI in drinks sold around the world . Health authorities have launched a fresh inquiry into the safety of a caramel colouring used in soft drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi. The decision has been taken by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in response to research showing varying levels of 4-methylimidazole (4-MI) in 12 brands of soft drink. The agency said it is also reviewing new data on the safety of 4-MI in other products. In the past the FDA, as well as food watchdogs in Britain and Europe, ruled that the chemical poses no threat to the health of consumers. However, health authorities in California include the substance on a list of cancer-causing agents. As a result drinks companies are required to put a cancer warning on products containing raised levels of 4-MI. In response to the law, Coke, Pepsi and other manufacturers directed their caramel-colour suppliers to reduce the levels of 4-MI. Coca-Cola subsequently promised to reduce levels of 4-MI in drinks sold around the world. However, the same safeguard  was not applied by Pepsi in a decision which outraged food campaigners in the UK. American campaigning group Consumer Reports tested Sprite, Diet Coke, Coca-Cola, Coke Zero, Dr Pepper, Dr Snap, Brisk Iced Tea, A&W Root Beer, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Pepsi One and Malta Goya. The tests found that single servings of two products purchased in California – Pepsi One and Malta Goya – exceeded the level of 4-MI which should have required a cancer warning on the label. No significant level was found in Sprite, and consistently low levels were found in Coke products. PepsiCo (headquarters pictured) has challenged the accuracy of the test results. A spokesman for the firm said the company was 'extremely concerned' about the reliability of the study . Toxicologist Dr Urvashi Rangan, who led the Consumer Reports investigation in the US, said:  ‘There is no reason why consumers need to be exposed to this avoid-able and unnecessary risk that can stem from colouring food and beverages brown.’ However, PepsiCo has challenged the accuracy of the test results. Aurora Gonzalez, a spokesman for the firm, said the company was ‘extremely concerned’ about the reliability of the study. She said: ‘PepsiCo abides by the law everywhere we do business.’ The UK arm of the drinks business has rejected claims that 4-MI poses any risk. Last year, the company said: ‘There is no scientific evidence that 4-MI in foods and beverages is a threat to human health. ‘Current regulation in the EU states that caramel colouring (4-MI) poses no health risks.’","Chemical 4-MI is to face a fresh inquiry into whether or not it causes cancer .

"A 16-year-old boy who was fatally bashed by three teenagers in Perth's north last year had been lured to a bush reserve under the guise of a cannabis deal, but they planned to rob him, a court has heard. Quinn De Campe was found bleeding, bruised and unconscious in Balga bushland on December 22. Within hours of being rushed to hospital in a critical condition, he was declared brain dead. The following day, he died from a traumatic brain injury, caused by multiple blows. Three teenage boys were initially charged with grievous bodily harm but that was later upgraded to murder. Quinn de Campe was fatally bashed by three teenagers on December 22, when they lured him into Western Australian bushland to rob him . In the West Australian Children's Court on Monday, they pleaded guilty to unlawful killing - a plea bargain accepted by the prosecution. The teens, along with another boy, also admitted to stealing from the victim. The court was told the boys stole $175 and two debit card from Quinn. The court also heard that Quinn had told his loved ones he was going to buy half an ounce of cannabis for his friends as Christmas gifts, having arranged to meet one of his attackers via Facebook. He barely knew the teen, having only spent one term with him at the same high school. Prosecutor Linda Petrusa said the young offenders made plans to 'roll' Quinn, with three of them laying in wait while the other boy met him and directed him into the bushland, saying that was a route to the dealer's house. Quinn refused to give up his belongings and was bashed to death. He was also kicked so hard as he lay on the ground that it left a shoe sole impression on his face . As the teens had conspired, they pretended to hold up their accomplice with a broken bottle. He fled, and when the three boys turned on Quinn, he refused to give up his belongings. Quinn was punched in the mouth but remained defiant, spitting blood into one of his attackers' face. That enraged the teen, who punched Quinn repeatedly. He was also kicked so hard as he lay on the ground that it left a shoe sole impression on his face. One of the teens later told police that he became enraged when Quinn 'arced up'. 'We thought it was going to be easier than that,' he told detectives. 'There was no backing down - I was with my mates.' Sentencing has been scheduled for November 19 and 20.

"The records of Captain Edward Smith, who was chosen to skipper the Titanic that sunk in April 1912, have been published online . The records of the doomed Titanic captain and his crew are among details of more than a million seamen which have been published online. Captain Edward Smith was chosen to captain the Titanic, which had been labelled practically unsinkable, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Plenty has been written about his role on the voyage, with historians in disagreement over his final moments on the ship. Now, people will have the chance to explore his career as a captain at sea before the sinking of the Titanic in the Atlantic in the early hours of April 15 1912, where he died along with more than 1,500 people. Born in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent in 1850, Captain Smith joined the White Star Shipping Line in 1880 and served aboard the company's freight liners around the world. In 1901, he was captain of the SS Majestic when he and his crew transported troops to Cape Colony during the Boer War for which he was awarded a special Transport Medal. However, there were warning signs of what was to come later when the white-whiskered skipper was captaining the RMS Olympic when she collided with British warship HMS Hawke in 1911. Following the collision, the ship's propeller was badly damaged and the vessel had to be returned to port. Despite the collision, Captain Smith was chosen to captain the Titanic on her voyage from Southampton to New York City. Historians dispute his final moments before the ship sunk. Scroll down for video . Born in Hanley, in the Potteries on January 27 1850. He attended Etruria British School in Stoke-on-Trent. After school Smith worked for about three years at the Etruria Forge where he operated a steam hammer. In 1867 he went to Liverpool to go to sea and followed in the footsteps of his half-brother Joseph Hancock, a captain on a sailing ship. At the age of 25 he passed his master's certificate of competency which meant he could command a vessel. In 1887 he married Sarah Eleanor Pennington, a farmer's daughter. In 1898, his only child Helen Melville Smith was born . Died on April 15 1912. Witnesses reported he dived into the sea as the bridge of the ship went under. What is known is that Captain Smith was awoken about 20 minutes before midnight on April 14 after the ship hit an iceberg. Some historians have said that Smith panicked, isolating himself on the bridge or locking himself away in his quarters while the crisis unfolded around him. He has also been criticised for allowing lifeboats to leave the ship only partially filled. But there are also tales of his behaviour during the evacuation which cast him in a more favourable light. Aside from tales of helping children into lifeboats, it is believed he was last seen in the bridge area having given the final order to abandon ship, before he died at the helm. He appears to have made no attempt to save himself. As well as Captain Smith's records, the details of all seamen from first officers to stockers are recorded in the Liverpool Crew Lists 1861-1919 collection. The Titanic was designed in Liverpool but the city never enjoyed the sight of it steaming up the Mersey. About 90 members of the crew came from the city, including the two lookouts who spotted the iceberg. The Titanic sunk in the Atlantic in the early hours of April 15 1912, which killed more than 1,500 people . It details the names of every crew member who worked on vessels registered to the Port of Liverpool, which was once one of the biggest ports in the world. In total, it records 912 ships with each crew member's name, age, birthplace, residence and past maritime experience, and even remarks on their general behaviour. There are also details on each list saying whether crew members were discharged, deserted or died at sea. The crew of the RMS Scotia, a famous mid-Victorian passenger liner which won the Blue Riband for breaking the record for the fastest Atlantic crossing in 1863, is also in the collection. Miriam Silverman, Senior UK Content Manager from Ancestry which has published the records online, said: 'From ship captains to their crew, this collection sheds light on a period in which the port of Liverpool was a global transport hub. 'With more than a million maritime records now available online at Ancestry it will also be of huge significance for anybody looking to trace their seafaring ancestors back to Liverpool at this time.'

"Crusade: Oliver, pictured with a chicken, will campaign against a trade deal . Jamie Oliver is planning a campaign to stop British food standards being lowered to allow American food imports pumped full of pesticides and hormones into the UK. The TV chef hopes to intervene to stop a trade agreement between the European United and U.S. aimed at removing trade barriers between member states. Mr Oliver, 39,  claims the 'dangerous' Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) deal could undo 'decades of work' by getting round bans imposed by the EU on putting growth hormones and pesticides in meat. The same restrictions do not exist in America - and at present if U.S. companies want to export food to the EU they must ensure it meets the higher standards. Speaking to The Times, Mr Oliver said: '[The deal] has the capacity to be very negative to British public health and British companies and British farmers. 'We don't have hormones in our meat, that's banned. But not over there. We don't have hundreds of poisons and pesticides that have been proven to be carcinogenic. They do. Their laws, their set-up, their safety regulations are nowhere near ours.' He said he has tried to lobby Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. Secretary of State, on the issue, but wasn't able to show her a video message he recorded on the subject. Scroll down for video . Attempts: Mr Oliver, 39, tried to put his points to Hillary Clinton when she visited the UK, but was unsuccessful . Fears: It has been claimed the deal could let in banned growth hormones which the U.S. allows (file photo) Substances that the EU have banned but which are permitted in the U.S. include pig growth hormone ractopamine and milk hormone BST. The agreement could also open the EU to chickens containing arsenic, poultry that has been chemically washed, and pesticides used on fruit and vegetables. A report from the Center for Food Safety, a U.S. lobby group, raised fears that the negotiations will 'dismantle many food safety regulations that corporations view as impediments to trade and profitmaking' and criticised the 'shroud of secrecy' under which negotiations are being conducted. Mr Oliver has previously launched food campaigns in the UK, notably on the standard of school dinners. Profits from Jamie Oliver's cookbooks have started drying up, according to new business records. Jamie Oliver Holdings Limited, the company which incudes his publishing and TV interests, recorded a £3.6million drop in profits this year - a fall of 37 per cent. New accounts, seen by the Financial Times, say that 2012 profits were £9.8million, while for 2013 they were only £6.2million. The company said the slump was because 'heavy investment' had damaged returns in the short term. Oliver cookbooks topped bestellers' lists in 2010, 2011 and 2012 - but performed worse last Christmas.","TV chef opposes 'dangerous' trade deal between EU and U.S.

Unfortunately we don’t have anti-tank weapons. ‘We are still defending the town, but our weapons are only very light and we have limited bullets,’ she said.

Although . the rocks may make people smirk, they are simply the result of ancient . volcanic eruptions, approximately 9 to 3 million years ago during the . late Miocene to Pliocene epochs, which covered the region with thick ash . that solidified into soft rock many metres thick. Erosion . from the wind and water left only its harder elements behind, forming . an unusual landscape of cones, pillars, pinnacles, mushrooms, and 'fairy . tale chimneys', some of which are up to 130 feet (40 metres) high. While the structures might make people smirk, they are not manmade but formed by the erosion of volcanic rock . Visitors are travelling to the area by hot air balloon to check out the unusual shaped rock formations . Every morning before sunrise, hundreds of hot air balloons rise into the air above Cappadocia, each holding around a dozen passengers for dawn-time hot air balloon travel, floating above and around the beautiful rock formations that has also jokingly been referred to as 'willy valley' by one travel blogger. Cappadocia is now considered one of the world's most popular destinations for hot air ballooning, and photographer Karsten Wrobel captured several images of the stunning rocks while on holiday in the area with her partner. The 43-year-old from Munich in Germany said: ‘We repeatedly visited Love Valley, hiking on our own and with the extremely hospitable owner of the lodge where we stayed. ‘We timed those visits with the early and late times of the day to capture the pillars bathed in golden light. These images of the pillars were captured by German photographer Karsten Wrobel, who recently visited . Situated in the very heart of modern day Turkey the natural wonder sits on a high plateau . Tourists travel miles by hot air balloon to check out the extraordinary phallic pillars of the Love Valley . ‘One morning we took a balloon ride at dawn. Despite this being the middle of winter, there must have been more than 50 balloons in the air. ‘We stayed in the air for about one hour, as the long shadows became gradually shorter and the day brighter before landing in a field and having a glass of Turkish sparkling wine. ‘My favourite shots are of my partner hiking in the shadows of the sunlit Love Valley pillars for they show the sheer unbelievable size of these rock formations.’ Beneath the rocky wonderland, the tourist atractions continue with a honeycomb of human-created caves with living quarters, places of worship, stables, and storehouses, dug into the soft stone by the people of the region. Entire towns have been formed with as many as eight different storeys underground. Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and  tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations.","Unusual shaped pillars are attracting tourists to Turkey's Cappadocia region .

"Newly released and shocking security video shows the moment an unarmed and handcuffed bodybuilder was shot dead by an El Paso police officer outside the city jail. The disturbing footage shows former Mr. El Paso, Daniel Saenz, 37, being dragged through the corridors and then outside, after guards refused to admit him because he was harming himself and was bleeding from a head wound. Once outside, the shirtless man struggles against Officer Jose Flores and another guard who lose control of him - causing Flores to reach first for his taser, then stop and instead pull his gun which goes off when the guard knocks his trigger finger. Scroll Down for Video (WARNING EXTREMELY GRAPHIC CONTENT) Struggle to transport: Officer Jose Flores (in uniform) and Daniel Saenz (shirtless) are seen left and right as Flores and another guardsman try and drag the prisoner to a car to drive him for medical attention . The footage dates from March 8, 2013 and was released by the Texas Attorney General to the El Paso Times who wanted to see the video after a grand jury refused to charge Officer Flores with any crime in February. Indeed, less than six weeks before the violent death of his prisoner, Flores had become something of a media sensation after being caught on camera buying boots and socks for a cold and hungry 83-year-old homeless man. On the afternoon of March 8 however, 5 feet, 8 inch tall, 217 pound Saenz had been arrested and brought into custody after acting strangely at a local grocery store and mental health treatment facility. However, because Saenz 'struck his own head into the doorway causing himself injury' the jail guards and Flores wanted the bodybuilder to travel to hospital for treatment to his bloody injury. Not yielding: Daniel Saenz is seen kicking and flailing in these images as Officer Flores and his assistant try to control him . Fatal: Officer Flores can be seen in the left image reaching for his taser with his left hand and then in the right image changing his mind and reaching for his right hand and his weapon . The guard and Flores struggled to get Saenz to cooperate and according to the investigation by CLEAT, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, Saenz had already been tased five-times already with little to no effect. Furthermore, Saenz had also been witnessed beforehand performing a dangerous contortionist trick which allowed him to put his handcuffed hands under his body to the front. This is called 'fronting' and would allow him far more mobility as he resisted. 'In the video, Officer Flores first reaches for his Taser,' said the official investigation from CLEAT. in the El Paso Times. Deadly: Officer Flores shoots Saenz as his hand is knocked by the guard . 'However, he decides not to deploy his Taser because he knew that Mr. Saenz — also earlier that same day — had undergone five cycles of the Taser device, without effect. 'He had been Tased earlier in the day after he assaulted a police officer and other people at the hospital where he was being evaluated.' According to CLEAT Officer Flores drew his handgun and not his taser because he knew that 'Saenz could quickly front his cuffs and turn them into a deadly weapon, given his considerable strength, agility and demonstrated resistance to the Taser ... 'At the same moment Officer Flores draws his weapon, Mr. Saenz pushes off on that curb and, with remarkable strength, sends the civilian escort flying backwards. 'The civilian escort's arm then hits the trigger hand of Officer Flores, causing his weapon to discharge.' Fatal moment from another angle: Officer Flores and his guard battle to keel bodybuilder Daniel Saenz under control until he draws his weapon and the guard knocks his hand (right) Emergency: Blood can be seen to have sprayed onto the floor in the aftermath of Daniel Saenz's shooting by Officer Flores . The bullet hit Saenz in the left shoulder and traveled down into his heart. He was treated at the scene by Flores and transported to hospital where he died later. The autopsy did not find cocaine, PCP or other hard drugs in his system but reported that Saenz tested positive for bath salts. The video - which was shot from multiple angles - was presented to a grand jury in February, which decided not to charge Flores. However, Flores is currently on leave. Tragedy: Daniel Saenz was on bath salts when police shot him dead and he was once the winner of Mr. El Paso in his bodybuilding days (right) Gentleman: A chance meeting between El Paso police officer Joe Flores and an 83-year-old homeless man resulted in a story that warmed everyone's hearts last year . Jim Jopling, a lawyer with CLEAT who represented Flores, said in their statement that they believe the grand jury cleared Flores because of 'the totality of the circumstances, which include the long sequence of events that came before the shooting itself.' Prior to the shooting, Saenz had been arrested after attacking an off-duty police officer and the staff at a mental health facility after he had been found harassing elderly people at a supermarket in El Paso. As Flores and the guard attempt to transport Saenz from the jail to an ER he hit his own head 'into the doorway causing himself injury'. He is taken outside and struggles for around a minute before twisting and turning violently - causing Flores to reach first for his taser and then his Glock semi-automatic before opening fire.","Officer Jose Flores shot dead former Mr. El Paso, Daniel Saenz, 37, after a struggle outside city jail .

"Manchester United splashed the cash during the summer in an attempt to fire themselves back into Premier League contention after their seventh-placed finish last season. New manager Louis van Gaal spent £150m to overhaul the squad at Old Trafford, bringing in the likes of Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria among others. With no fewer than six new arrivals to bed in ahead of this weekend's game against QPR, we asked our team of experts what they think Van Gaal's strongest team is (assuming everyone is fit.) De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Di Maria    Carrick    Blind . Van Persie    Falcao     Rooney . MATT BARLOW . Four at the back offers a more solid base for all the attacking forces. Carrick in to sit and control. Legs from Blind and Di Maria. And what a front three. Sadly no room for Mata, a wonderful player, but he can be involved behind two strikers with a slight tweak to 4-3-1-2. You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . Arrival: Colombian striker Radamel Falcao joined United on loan from Monaco on transfer deadline day . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Evans    Shaw . Di Maria    Carrick    Blind . Van Persie    Falcao     Rooney . LEE CLAYTON . Still not sure about the key full-back areas and Rafael is a mistake waiting to happen every game. Carrick, playing very deep and dropping to make an auxiliary centre back/front sweeper is key to this. Mata slows down the game too much. The front three could be explosive, if they can fit together. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ryan Giggs views on youth at United . Bow: £60m British record signing Angel di Maria made his United debut in the 0-0 draw at Burnley . De Gea . Smalling     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Herrera     Blind . Rooney . Van Persie     Falcao     Di Maria . MATT LAWTON . I think there are weaknesses in this side, not least at the back. I’ve gone for Smalling at right back because I simply don’t trust Rafael. But the forward line, with Rooney playing a number 10 role, is packed with pace and ability. This is a team that should score more goals than it concedes. In and out: Juan Mata has struggled to cement a place in the team since his big-money move from Chelsea . De Gea . Valencia     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Herrera     Blind . Rooney      Mata      Di Maria . Falcao . CHRIS WHEELER . Even though it’s an attacking line-up, there’s no room for Van Persie. On current form, he would be used off the bench. The system depends on two things: the front three of Rooney, Mata and Di Maria being inter-changeable, and Valencia and Shaw being more defensively responsible. Otherwise, I wouldn’t fancy facing this lot. Competition: Robin van Persie's first-team place is under threat after the arrival of Falcao . De Gea . Smalling      Evans      Rojo . Rafael    Blind   Herrera  Di Maria  Januzaj . Rooney       Falcao . DOMINIC KING . Try and play around with the names United have available and you will see that for all razzmatazz up front, the defence wouldn't fill you with great confidence. They might score goals but they are going to concede a few along the way until Van Gaal's methods begin to work. They couldn't slip up against QPR with those options, could they? Skipper: Wayne Rooney has struggled to make his mark after being named as Manchester United captain . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Evans     Rojo . Carrick . Di Maria            Blind . Mata . Falcao      Van Persie . JOE BERNSTEIN . Take a leaf out of England's book and play with a diamond to get the best out of attacking players. The problem is Rooney, arguably United's best all-round player but master of none. Is he specifically a better creative number 10 than Mata? But he would be first reserve if anyone is tired, injured or suspended. Fitting in: Ander Herrera was one of United's first signings in the transfer window from Athletic Bilbao . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Evans     Rojo . Fletcher      Blind . Januzaj     Rooney     Di Maria . Falcao . ROB DRAPER . Ditch the back three - Van Gaal has played with four for much of his career so there's no need to continue with a vanity project. Luke Shaw will have to take a back seat for now and van Persie and Mata will have to learn how to be super subs. Just get the right shape and the best 11 on the pitch and worry about reputations later. Ideally Carrick would play in holding midfield when back from injury. Switch: Dutchman Daley Blind poses at Carrington after joining Manchester United from Ajax . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Herrera     Blind     Di Maria . Rooney . Van Persie      Falcao . MARTHA KELNER . This system best accommodates the almost embarrassment of riches Manchester United have in attack. Rooney reverting to the No 10 role allows for Falcao's inclusion and could suit him better as he ages and loses the electrifying burst of pace he once had. Four at back is stronger. Mata is the one to miss out. Moving on: Striker Danny Welbeck was sold to Arsenal for £16million on transfer deadline day . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Blind . Rooney     Mata     Januzaj . Van Persie      Falcao . SAM CUNNINGHAM . With that many forward options, Manchester United need to revert to Liverpool's hyper-attacking formation of last season to get the most out of them. Even then, there is still no place in my side for new-boy Di Maria. Mata gets the nod for me, to give him a chance to return to the devastating form he produced in the No 10 role for Chelsea. Herrera is also sacrificed in that formation, with Blind's defensive ability required over Herrera's diverse passing range. It also opens up a space for Januzaj on the left wing. He is one of the brightest young talents in world football, so it is astounding he's not first choice already. Rooney is forced into the right of the three attacking midfielders behind the strikers, but I feel his future lies further back. Home: Nani (right) ended his Old Trafford stay to return to Portugal and Sporting Lisbon . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Blind . Di Maria     Rooney     Herrera . Falcao      Van Persie . LAURIE WHITWELL . This system is a defensive risk but Blind performs the screening role ahead of the back four excellently, and would allow the likes of Di Maria and Herrera scope to get forward to do damage. Those two up front would scare the daylights out of any centre-backs and Rooney can pull the strings. Shaw needs to get fit and Rafael produce consistency but they are full-backs of quality. Rojo sneaks in ahead of Evans after his MK Dons horror show. Condition: Luke Shaw has been hampered by fitness and injury problems since moving from Southampton . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Januzaj     Carrick     Blind     Di Maria . Van Persie      Falcao . CRAIG HOPE . Forget three at the back, it’s had its summer of love, it would be a winter of depression if Van Gaal persisted with it. And forget  Rooney, he’s become a problem for club and country, an angry man who knows his powers are – pardon the pun – on the wane. The back four picks itself but the two who miss out in midfield are Herrera and  Mata. Herrera looks a class act, admittedly, but  Carrick will be more like the player of two seasons ago with the likes of Di Maria and Falcao to feed off his cunning creativity. Blind provides a little bit more know-how in the middle of the park and that allows Januzaj and Di Maria to terrorise down the flanks. Van Persie and Falcao could be devastating as a pair, don’t complicate it by trying to accommodate Rooney. Carrick gets the armband. Sliding in: New signing Marcos Rojo (right) in action for Argentina in a friendly against Germany . De Gea . Rafael     Jones     Rojo     Shaw . Carrick . Di Maria     Rooney     Blind . Van Persie      Falcao . NICK HARRIS . This emphasises Van Gaal’s riches from midfield up and dearth of options in defence. You’d ideally want a better right-back and another better, more consistent centre-half, at least one. As it is, a shield is crucial, Carrick in this case with the huge proviso he's at his peak. Rooney would have license to roam in the central role of the three. Other choices there abound - Fletcher, Mata and Herrera foremost among them. Plenty to ponder: Louis van Gaal is without a win in his first four games as Manchester United manager . De Gea . Valencia     Jones     Rojo    Shaw . Herrera    Blind    Di Maria . Rooney . Van Persie      Falcao . CHARLIE SKILLEN . Van Gaal will have to make the best out of a poor selection of defenders. He can keep the marauding full-backs of Valencia and Shaw, but Jones and  Rojo will have to form a decent partnership – quickly. The signing of Blind should add a bite to midfield previously lacking, while he can also drop into a back three if the full-backs are bombing on. Attacking-wise is clearly a different story - Di Maria can add creativity from a midfield position while Rooney will also drop deep, leaving Van Persie and Falcao as the deadliest duo in the league. Juan Mata will be the odd man out and see his second consecutive January transfer. Blow: Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the winner for Swansea in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford on the opening day . Lagging behind: United have just two points from their first three Premier League games . De Gea . Jones     Carrick     Rojo . Rafael                                        Shaw . Herrera     Blind . Di Maria . Rooney     Falcao . JOE RIDGE . There is no room for Mata in the side, no matter how you look at it. It's also near impossible to see how Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao can all play together. Given that Rooney got the nod to captain United over Van Gaal, one has to assume Van Persie is now third choice. With Jones and Rojo doing the dirty work either side of him, Carrick could be developed into a sweeper and linchpin of Van Gaal's 3-5-2.

"Islamic State has renewed its call for followers to carry out lone wolf killings of Australians and citizens from four other countries in the alliance against the militant group. The jihad group's latest call to arms in its propaganda magazine, Dabiq, was headlined, 'Rush to Support Your State, O Muslim'. The article said it is very important that attacks take place in every country that has entered into the alliance against the Islamic State, especially the US, UK, France, Australia and Germany. Scroll down for video . The article 'Rush to Support Your State, O Muslim', released in the jihad group's  propaganda magazine, Dabiq, calls on Muslims to act out violent killings on citizens from Australia, UK, US, Germany and France . 'Every Muslim should get out of his house, find a crusader and kill him. Secrecy should be followed when planning and executing any attack,' says the fourth edition of the IS recruitment publication. 'The smaller the numbers of those involved and the less the discussion beforehand, the more likely it will be carried out without problems. 'One should not complicate the attacks by involving other parties, purchasing complex materials, or communicating with weak-hearted individuals. '""Rely upon Allah and stab the crusader"" should be the battle cry for all Islamic State patrons.'

"Archaeologists in Italy have discovered a mummified foetus from the 19th century that is thought to have undergone a destructive operation while it was still inside its mother’s womb. It appears the procedure to break up the foetus was carried out after its death, when the mother’s life was in danger- and the remains were then carefully wrapped up. The mummy  is the only case of the surgical practice - which was popular in ancient times - in the central region of Italy, researchers claim. Archaeologists in Italy have discovered a mummified foetus from the 19th century that is thought to have undergone an operation while it was still inside its mother’s womb. The remains were carefully wrapped in cloth and laid to rest in an underground room with other remains . The gruesome find came to light after an earthquake struck L’Aquila, Italy, in 2009, Live Science reported. The 6.3 magnitude disaster killed 300 people as well as damaging buildings including the St. John the Evangelist church in the village of Casentino. It was beneath this church that the mummified bodies, including the foetus, were found in underground rooms. Researchers estimate that the foetus was laid to rest in 1840. They X-rayed the remains to discover that the skeleton was not connected properly, so some of the bones had been moved around. The X-ray is pictured . Embryotomy is the dismemberment of a foetus while it is in the womb. It was practiced when a mother's life was threatened, to aid the foetus' removal when delivery was impossible by natural means. Some experts say embryotomy was used as an extreme method of abortion in medieval times. It was common in ancient Egypt as well as ancient Rome. It is thought embryotomy has been practiced in some places as late as 50 years ago. Researchers estimate  the foetus was laid to rest in 1840. They X-rayed the remains to discover that the skeleton was not connected properly, highlighting that some of the bones had been moved around. Experts could not establish the sex of the foetus because the pelvic and jaw bones were damaged, but they think it was 29 weeks into development when it perished. They think the procedure took place because the skull had been dissected in places, and separated from the spine. And the arms were found to be broken at the joints, according to the study, published in the International Journal of Osteoarcheology. These characteristics ‘strongly suggest a case of embryotomy,’ according to Ruggero D'Anastasio of University Museum at University of Chieti, Italy. Other mummified remains (pictured) discovered at the site have undergone radiocarbon dating and are thought to date back to the 19th century or earlier. Some have lesions from autopsy procedures . The gruesome find came to light after an earthquake struck L’Aquila, Italy, in 2009. This image shows the ruined remains of the St. John the Evangelist church in the village of Casentino, where mummified bodies, including the foetus, were found in underground rooms . Some of the bodies discovered beneath a church in the village of Casentino (marked) had lesions from autopsy procedures, showing doctors at the time removed bone from the skull in order to access the brain . Researchers estimate that the foetus was laid to rest in 1840 along with other remains (pictured) Embryotomy is the dismemberment of a foetus in the womb in order to make a delivery possible by natural means. Dr D'Anastasio said that such a procedure was common in Alexandria and Rome in the 1st and 2nd centuries. It was used to remove a foetus from the womb that had already died, or to preserve a mother’s life if she was threatened by delivery complications. Some experts claim that embryotomy was used as an extreme method of abortion in medieval times, but was not thought to be common less than 200 years ago. The remains of the foetus were reassembled into its natural shape, with pieces of skull placed carefully inside a carefully-made cloth. Unlike the brutal procedure, the dressing of the remains suggests compassion for unborn children at the time. Other mummified remains discovered at the site have undergone radiocarbon dating and are thought to date back to the 19th century or earlier. Personal items such as rings, shoes, rosary beads, clothes and shrouds also helped the archaeologists date the remains. Some of the bodies had lesions from autopsy procedures, showing doctors at the time removed bone from the skull in order to access the brain.

"Polar ice is melting quicker than previously thought and threatening to raise global sea levels by a couple of centimetres - with disastrous effect, scientists have warned. The dramatic changes could increase flooding on small tropical islands and leave penguins starving. And Professor Karen Heywood from the University of East Anglia said it was 'probably' due to global warming. Scroll down for video . Waters around glaciers in West Antarctica are warmer than thought, causing polar ice to melt quicker than expected. This could raise sea levels by a few centimetres, flooding islands and leaving penguins starving (stock image shown). And one researcher says the effect was 'probably' due to global warming . The new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of West Antarctica have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years, from 0.8 to 1.2°C (33.4 to 34.2°F). As a result the ice caps of the region are melting quicker than ever before and sea levels are rising. Professor Karen Heywood, from the University of East Anglia, said: 'More ice is melting and that would lead to more flooding in our country in the immediate future. An Esa satellite recently spotted an unusual consequence of the melting of ice in Antarctica. While rising sea levels and changing global temperatures are already thought to be a consequence of manmade climate change, the GOCE satellite - which was not intended to study the effects of a warming climate - has found that gravity is weakening where ice is melting the fastest. The results show that the thinning ice sheet from November 2009 to June 2012 caused local variations in gravity, measured by the satellite. The GOCE satellite burned up in Earth's atmosphere as planned in November 2013 after four years in orbit. During its mission it measured Earth's gravity in unprecedented detail, detailing where it was weakest and strongest on the surface. 'It means we need to think more about our flood defences. 'We need to account for these sea level rises and make sure they are big enough. 'It could also be particularly bad for some of the tropical islands. They are some of the poorest populations in the world and they could just disappear. 'We are forecasting that the sea level might rise by a couple of centimetres which would be enough to have a big impact.' Professor Heywood, of the university's Centre for Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, added: 'It could also affect the krill population which might migrate elsewhere if the water is too warm. 'They are the base of the food chain and are eaten by the penguins, the seals and the whales. It would have a knock on effect for wildlife in the region. 'I don't know if there is anything the human population can do but it is something we need to take account of.' She added: 'We can’t say it is global warming, rather than part of a natural cycle. But I suspect it probably is. 'It is among the most thorough looks at the waters in the area to date, and fits in with climate change due to anthropogenic sources.' The new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of West Antarctica (stock image shown) have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years, from 0.8 to 1.2°C (33.4 to 34.2°F) The new research has found that the shallow shelf seas of West Antarctica (stock image shown) have become about half a degree warmer in the last 50 years, from 0.8 to 1.2°C (33.4 to 34.2°F) Scientists from the UK, Germany, America and Japan analysed data from oceanographic records dating back to 1960. It revealed temperatures in the West Antarctic Amundsen Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea had been rising for the past 50 years. They also found the water was less salty which has accelerated the melting and sliding of glaciers in the region. It also reveals that other Antarctic areas could experience melting for the first time and there is no indication that this trend will reverse. Professor Heywood said: 'The Antarctic ice sheet is a giant water reservoir. 'The ice cap on the southern continent is on average 2,100 metres [6,900 feet] thick and contains about 70 per cent of the world's fresh water. 'If this ice mass were to melt completely, it could raise the global sea level by 60 metres [195 feet]. 'That's not going to happen, but it gives you an idea of how much water is stored there. 'Accelerated glacial melting in this area has been observed for some time, causing a major contribution to rising sea levels worldwide. ' The research was funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council. The study, entitled 'Multidecadal warming of Antarctic waters', is being published in the journal Science.","Waters around glaciers in West Antarctica are warmer than thought .

"As Sir Dave Brailsford said this week, ‘the best sports people in the world aren't normal people’. Brailsford was talking in the context of the Kevin Pietersen controversy but he just as easily could have been referring to the author rivalling the former England batsman for the most explosive new sports book to have come out this week on a Monday. A certain Roy Keane. Keane would probably admit to being a man of extremes. Extremely talented, of course. Extremely complex, too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the best bits from Roy Keane' book launch . Roy Keane would probably admit to being a man of extremes: Extremely talented, but extremely complex . In Keane's upcoming autobiography he shows a lack of remorse for his tackle on Alf-Inge Haaland in 2001 . Keane also details his ongoing feud with former Manhcester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson . Keane's autobiography, The Second Half . But now there has been time to read beyond those headline-grabbing passages that were initially extracted from The Second Half, there is more depth to Keane than we perhaps might have expected to see. There is a sense of warmth as well as self-deprecation; a sense of humour as well as candid self-analysis. And an admission to suffering from the same anxieties, the same self-doubt, that trouble most of us at some point in our lives, if not for much of the time. This is not to ignore some of the of more controversial sections. We will still wince at his response to news of Clive Clarke’s heart attack, just as we will remain uncomfortable with his lack of remorse for that horror challenge on Alf-Inge Haaland. But we will also delight in the score-settling with Sir Alex Ferguson and the brutal, sometimes hilarious, assessment of people he has encountered over the years. That said, I’ve always believed there is a degree of decency about Keane, even if I was only ever offered the briefest glimpse of his personality as his ghost for a short-lived newspaper column and the occasional interview. I’d had my fair share of run-ins with him by the time we met in a Bangkok hotel in 2001, where Manchester United were staying on a pre-season tour, to discuss how we would work together. Regrets apologising to Ferguson . Does not regret his tackle on  Haaland . Told Fergie 'We need f****** more' Wouldn't have missed a drugs test like Rio . Headbutted Peter Schmeichel . He had once torn into me for approaching him one morning at the Irish team hotel to request an interview. On another occasion for diverting my eyes from his stare, towards a team-mate clowning around behind him, during a conversation in a post-match interview zone. Both times he complained of my bad manners amid a flurry of expletives. Class of 92 . Real Madrid regret . Ferguson wanted me to wear No 7 . Turned down Celtic this summer . Re-opens feud with Fergie . The Irish team hotel incident was one he did return to the following day, approaching me in the same lobby and informing me he was now ready to do the interview. You wouldn’t call it an apology but it was rather like an incident that appears to have happened at an airport earlier this week. According to a Danish United fanzine editor who contacted me via Twitter, Keane cursed at a guy for taking a picture of him only to then agree to a photograph of them together. Only recently I ran into a former United coach who only had good things to say about Keane. The coach had been a member of Ferguson’s staff when they won the Treble in 1999, but had not received a Champions League winners’ medal when they were handed out that night in Barcelona. Keane thought this was hugely unfair, and gave the coach his. Keane celebrates winning the Champions League in 1999 - but didn't play in the final against Bayern . Keane gave his winners' medal to a United coach, who had only good things to say about him . The Republic of Ireland midfielder celebrates with Dwight Yorke after the final whistle at the Nou Camp . As a columnist, Keane had a very clear idea of how things were going to work. My only means of contacting him would be by fax. He would then reply by text, or occasionally with a call, but always with the number withheld. At a later date, for an interview after his sudden departure from the World Cup in 2002, I was given a home number. But he was quick to point out that, once our business had been concluded, the number would be changing. If he wasn’t the easiest to get hold of, he remained a dream to work with; even though he was being paid absolute peanuts for doing the fortnightly column. For Keane this particular exercise wasn’t about the money. The opportunity had clearly appealed to him. It was decided we would always discuss the columns face-to-face, at a hotel in Manchester. And he was never late. If anything, he would be a little early. Keane was part of one of Manchester United's most successful teams, with the 'Class of 92' prominent . Keane (left), here with United in Tokyo in 1999, would never ask for a drink, and only took messages by fax . And he would never take a drink; even water. After three or four visits to the same hotel bar I insisted he let me buy a round because we could be there for a couple of hours without spending a penny. I bought him a water and he didn’t so much as lift the glass. The column was terrific. Not least his view on the sudden sale of Jaap Stam to Lazio. He might have been the captain of Manchester United but it did not stop him declaring that players can be treated like ‘pieces of meat’ by their clubs. Given that Ferguson’s son, Jason, had been involved in the deal as an agent, that would not have gone down well. Keane didn’t care. Sadly, after three or four columns I received a call from his lawyer saying he did not want to continue. The reason given was the red card he had received after clashing with Newcastle’s Alan Shearer. Keane's column was brilliant - he was fantastic talking about Jaap Stam's departure from United . The piece was stopped as Keane didn't want to continue after clashing with Newcastle's Alan Shearer . He was furious with himself for allowing Shearer to provoke him and was certainly in no mood to reflect on the incident in his next column. But reading this new book I wonder if he also didn’t like the sense of routine. ‘I don’t like it when companies become too comfortable with me,’ he writes in reference to his television work. ‘I don’t like feeling owned – it tightens the chest. If I’m to be an employee, I want it to be for a club or a football organisation, not in media.’ Beyond his family the game of football is his world, and this new role as deputy to Martin O’Neill and Paul Lambert seems to be one he enjoys. He might be a natural leader but that story of the medal in Barcelona tells you how much importance he stores in a good coach. As a captain he must have been as inspiring as he could occasionally be terrifying. If Pietersen thinks Matt Prior was an intimidating presence in the dressing room, heaven knows what he would have made of Keane. But only now, only with the publication of this book, can we even begin to understand what actually makes the man tick. The media work doesn't do anything for him: 'I don't like it when companies become too comfortable with me' Keane knows what a good coach means to a team, so will continue his hard work with Ireland and Aston Villa .

"The Indonesian victim of a shocking murder-suicide in Brisbane has finally been laid to rest. The body of Mayang Prasetyo, 27, was discovered dismembered in her Brisbane apartment last month. The transgender woman's Australian husband Marcus Volke, 27, fled the apartment when police arrived, and took his own life in a nearby industrial bin. Scroll down for video . Ms Prasetyo, originally from Indonesia, has been laid to rest . Parts of Ms Prasetyo's body were found strewn across the couple's new Teneriffe apartment . The mother of Ms Prasetyo says she has forgiven Volke for the murder of her daughter . Police say he had tried to dispose of Ms Mayang's remains by boiling them on the stove, in what they can only surmise was a domestic violence situation that got terribly out of hand. Ms Mayang's mother Nining Sukarni said on Saturday it was a relief to finally lay her eldest child to rest. She thanked both Australian and Indonesian authorities who made the repatriation to Bandar Lampung a smooth process. 'Everyone has been very helpful,' she told AAP. 'Friends, neighbours, even people from the related government offices. Many of them came to her funeral.' It's understood identification issues delayed the release of Ms Mayang's body. Mayang Prasetyo was found dismembered in a Brisbane apartment she shared with her husband on Saturday . Volke's funeral was held in Victoria last month. Then, Ms Nining said she was stunned the quiet, polite young man she had met was capable of such a crime, but that she was able to forgive him. She says Volke's family has not contacted her since the deaths. Volkeworked under the name Heath and was registered as a private escort in Melbourne . Volke also advertised on online escorting sites . Ms Mayang, who was born Febri Andriansyah, worked as an escort to support her family in Indonesia and put her two sisters through school. Her friends have remembered her for this dedication to her family, as well as her fascination with celebrities and bubbly personality. The brothel owner who employed Ms Mayang praised the  'divine, beautiful, gentle' person who suffered at the hands of her abusive ice addict husband. Mr Gneil laughed off claims that the couple met on a cruise ship and said they met at his brothel . Ms Prasetyo and her husband Marcus Volke were both employed as prostitutes at Ivan Gneil's Pleasure Dome brothel until 2012. The owner claimed the other female staff were scared of Volke after he brought a gun to work. Mr Gneil told Daily Mail Australia he knew Ms Prasetyo for about five years, as he revealed how he heard Volke had become violent towards her. Volke worked at the Pleasure Dome as a male prostitute for around two and a half years before he and Ms Prasetyo both left to work privately in 2012 . 'Marcus was just your average sort of boy. Other girls here said he had started to become violent. He was asked to leave here and the reason, I believe, was because he brought a gun in,' Mr Gneil said. The owner told how the managers at the brothel had expressed concerns that Volke had 'become a bit aggressive towards them before he was asked to leave'. 'He was known to be violent towards transsexuals when he was with them. Marcus was also definitely a drug user. He was on ice, we just don't tolerate it here,' Mr Gneil added. Brothel owner Ivan Gneil (right) has revealed he employed both Marcus Volke (left) and Mayang Prasetyo (centre) at the Pleasure Dome in Melbourne. He  claimed the other female staff were scared of Volke after he bought a gun to work . The remains of Ms Prasetyo were found cooking inside a Teneriffe apartment - in Brisbane's inner-city - on Saturday night. Volke fled the scene when police showed up at the couple's home and was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby. 'I'm truly shocked by the news, absolutely devastated. When you don't see anyone for a while (in this industry) you just assume they've gone overseas, so it was horrific to think what Mayang went through. 'I couldn't imagine anyone killing someone and chopping them up but I guess I should have seen it coming,' Mr Gneil said. Ms Prasetyo finished working at the brothel the day after Volke left. It was revealed Volke was a male prostitute and covered up his secret life by telling close friends and family he was a chef. The 27-year-old was known as Febri Andriansyah, according to her Indonesian passport . Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container on Monday, following the discovery of Ms Prasetyo's body parts found boiling in chemicals in a Brisbane apartment on Saturday night . Speaking through an interpreter, Nining Sukarni - the mother of Ms Prasetyo - said  she had already forgiven her son-in-law. 'I have forgiven. I have no demands whatsoever or revengeful feeling. Because I love Marcus just like I love Maya,' she told The Courier Mail. Ms Sukarni said she had met Volke when the couple came to visit her at her Lampung home in rural Indonesia in 2013. Emergency services remove her body from the DoubleOne 3 Apartments in Commercial Road . 'They loved each other. We have already considered him as part of the family. I love him,' she said . Ms Sukarni described Ms Prasetyo - who her mother refers to as  Febri Andriansyah - as 'cheerful, friendly and loud' and a 'good son'. She said when they came to visit in August last year Volke had cooked with Ms Prasetyo and the visit passed without incident. 'He was kind and loving, shy and reserved. In our eyes he was kind. I never suspected anything,' Ms Surkarni said. Queensland Police made the grisly discovery of a woman's body parts in Brisbane . Friends of the couple revealed the truth about Marcus Volke's double life to Daily Mail Australia and also criticised a Brisbane newspaper for its portrayal of victim Mayang Prasetyo. Interior designer Alex Devantier, who knew the couple well, told Daily Mail Australia Volke had never worked as a chef but used it as a cover story to avoid telling his family and close friends the truth about his life as Heath the male prostitute. In an online advertisement under the name Heath XL, Volke describeed himself as a 'young sexy Australian boy, very friendly and easy going'. Ms Prasetyo's remains were found at an apartment on Commercial Road and Volke's body was found on Dath Street . The ad went onto to say: 'I can be your companion for an hour or as long as u want, for a dinner, a hot session, holidays or more'. Mr Devantier met Volke and Ms Prasetyo - who were married in Europe in August 2013 - four years ago in Melbourne and introduced them. 'They both went into private escorting. I actually helped Marcus register as a private escort in Melbourne and then with his advertising.' Mr Devantier, from Townsville, said he was in shock over the tragedy. 'I still don't believe he [Volke] did it. I can't believe he did it. If he did do it, sometimes you can't judge it, you can't pick it,' Mr Devantier said.

"Rising numbers of Asian women are having pubic hair transplants to combat a rare medical condition. Surgeons are being increasingly called on to transplant hair from the heads of  women, to their pubic region. The latest figures show the number of pubic hair transplants in Asia has increased since 2006. Between 2010 and 2012 alone, there was 78 per cent increase in pubic hair transplants in this geographical area, according to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS). Rising numbers of Korean women are undergoing a procedure to have hair from their head transplanted into their pubic region, to combat a condition which leaves them with insufficient pubic hair . The condition, called pubic atrichosis or hypotrichosis, causes otherwise healthy women to lack pubic hair. It is particularly common in Korean women of Mongolian origin, according to a report published in the journal of Dermatologic Surgery. Meanwhile one Korean clinic estimates that 10 per cent of women in the country have pubic atrichosis, according to the blog Refinery29. As pubic hair is seen as a sign of sexual health and fertility, many women suffer from psychological stress. Surgery is the only solution to the condition. ISHRS figures from 2011 show that Asia conducted the largest amount of eyelash, eyebrow and pubic area hair restorations worldwide. And yearly figures show that in 2012, there were 576 pubic hair transplant operations in Asia, up from 324 in 2010. The hair transplantation procedure starts at $2,000 and involves doctors taking hair from the head and inserting it into the pubic region, by inserting bulbs into the women's skin. The procedure takes two to four hours, but it may take a few sessions for the hair to take root. After the hair transplant, women can grow their hair into a new shape, such as a, fan or diamond. Writing on the website, a spokesperson from the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery said: 'While loss of scalp hair is more likely to concern East Asian men, some East Asian women and/or their husbands are concerned by the loss of female pubic hair. 'Loss of pubic hair, or failure to grow pubic hair, is somewhat more common in East Asian women than in women of other ancestry. 'Transplants of pubic hair may be considered as a procedure to help an East Asian woman recover satisfactory self-esteem.' Women who shave their bikini lines risk complications such as infections, burns, severe itching, rashes or cuts, a study has warned. U.S. researchers found that 87 per cent of women currently remove all or some of their pubic hair, with the majority using a razor, while the rest admitted to getting a bikini wax at least once in their life. Almost two thirds (60 per cent) of the women also reported experiencing at least one health-related complication, which also included invisible cuts to the skin called epidermal abrasions, ingrown hairs, bruises or allergies. Overweight and obese women were found to be twice as likely to experience a complication than their slimmer counterparts and three times more likely if they removed all of their pubic hair rather than just some of it.","Pubic atrichosis is a condition which causes women to lack pubic hair .

"With a beauty industry saturated with lotions and potions promising to turn back the clock, treating fine lines and pigmentation on our face is already enough of a minefield. If the daily cleanse, tone and moisturise routine is already too much for you (and that's before you've even considered serums, toners and oils), it's about to get a lot more complicated. New ranges of creams and serums targeted at beating hand wrinkles are starting to hit shelves so that beauty buffs can give their mitts the same attention as their faces. Another body part to worry about! With hands being one of the most tell-tale signs of ageing, new ranges of creams and serums targeted at beating hand wrinkles are being rolled out . But why do we need more products to add to our already lengthy beauty regime? Here's why: As the years pass, skin on the hands thins, causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear. While make-up can disguise tell-tale signs of ageing on the face, it's more difficult with hands - which is why it's often said that hands are the best indicator of age. In fact, research by beauty firm No7 showed one in eight of us is more worried about our hands betraying our age than our faces. That's where a new host of potent products come in that are designed to plump hands, beat wrinkles and reduce dark spots. Damage done: As the years pass, skin on the hands thins, causing veins to become more prominent and liver spots to appear . New range: Mavala has a whole range of treatments aimed at hand health, such as the Repair Night Cream (£36.50), which is packed with the all-important hyaluronic acid and silk amino acids to help cell renewal and even a cleansing mask, right, to refresh hands . One of the newest power players on the market is Hand Chemistry - a brand dedicated to improving the firmness, elasticity, density, evenness, brightness, texture, smoothness and hydration of hands. Their new Hyaluronic Concentrate has been formulated with a 19 per cent marine hyaluronic complex, which includes a 99.5 per cent pure hyaluronic acid - an ingredient well-known for providing incredible hydration to skin. There's also lots of other potent ingredients packed in there such as red marina algae, which apparently increases cell turnover, as well as tamarind to hydrate skin below the surface. Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Anti-Ageing Hand Cream (great for those on a budget at £3.99 from Boots), has been dermatologically proven to protect your hands from dryness whilst reducing some of the visible signs of ageing. The hand cream contains glycerin and shea butter to diffuse active moisture into the skin and with its exclusive soy complex, the formula claims to visibly reduce the appearance of brown spots. Day and night: Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Anti-Ageing Hand Cream, which has been dermatologically proven to protect your hands from dryness whilst reducing some of the visible signs of ageing, is great for daytime wear, while E45's offering boots regeneration whilst you sleep . The E45 Repair & Protect Overnight Hand Cream also costs £3.99 and promises to enhance skin cell repair and regeneration overnight and helps protect skin’s natural defences. Palmer’s £3.99 Eventone Age Spot Hand Cream helps reduce the appearance of dark spots and takes it one step further by helping to minimise the risk of further skin damages thanks to the built-in SPF. Mavala has a whole range of treatments aimed at hand health. First up is the Mavala Repair Night Cream (£36.50), which is packed with the all-important hyaluronic acid and silk amino acids to help cell renewal and moisture retention. It even comes with specially designed cotton gloves to enclose hands after application to help the rich cream penetrate effectively while you sleep. Potent: Hand Chemistry's new Hyaluronic Concentrate has been formulated with a 19 per cent marine hyaluronic complex,  that is well known for providing incredible hydration to skin . They also have a £22.25 Cleansing Mask for Hands aimed at benefiting dry and damaged hands. It contains  botanical extracts which remove impurities, refresh and invigorate, and aloe vera to calm and soften the skin. If that wasn't enough, there's the Mavala Anti Blemish Cream for Hands (£17.00) aimed at helping with pigmentary blemishes, which represent one of the major natural phenomena of ageing skin. Hormonal changes and frequent exposure to the sun are to blame. So, with the passing of time, pigmentary blemishes, more commonly called brown spots, appear on the skin. The brand say their cream tones down and prevents the appearance of pigmentary blemishes. Its botanical extracts (strawberry begonia and mulberry root) promise to help regulate the natural pigmentation, while an exfoliating agent and almond proteins allow a gentle peeling of dead skin overloaded with melanin, giving back radiance and suppleness. It's hardly surprising that these new hand creams are big business. Cosmetic surgery clinics have reported an 18 per cent increase in enquiries about anti-ageing procedures on their hands - proving how much of a concern it's becoming. The new cosmetic surgery trend, which sees women having dermal fillers and laser resurfacing to reduce the signs of ageing, has been dubbed the banishing of 'Madonna Mitts' after popstar Madonna, 55, who has 'anti-aged' almost every part of her body but often resorts to fingerless gloves to cover her hands. Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director and fat transfer specialist at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'It is common for women, as they grow older, to lose weight in their hands, which means that veins and wrinkles can become more evident. Prolonged exposure to the sun will also speed up the ageing process. 'And while treatments like laser resurfacing to target the signs of ageing, or traditional fillers to make the hands appear fuller and healthier, can offer effective results, these can really only ever offer a temporary solution. 'A more long terms solution is fat transfer – a technique which is fast becoming one of the most popular for hand rejuvenation purposes. The procedure uses advanced technology to produce a pure and effective fat graft, which means that fat can safely be taken from one area of the patient’s body, such as their thighs or stomach, and injected into the hands. 'The fact that the procedure is minimally invasive is also an important factor. Many patients have careers which do not allow for them to be away from work for long periods of time. Fat transfer is a walk-in, walk-out procedure and one which is performed under local anaesthetic, so patients can undergo treatment without too much disruption to their lives. 'Over time I expect to see procedures such as this continue to grow in popularity, as women decide to invest further in different aspects of their appearance, later into life.' Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street said: 'One piece of advice I always give my patients is that skincare should not stop at the jawline. This new category of products show that an increasing number of women, who perhaps have a regimented facial regime, are now taking steps to ensure that their hands don’t give away tell-tale signs of age. 'Hands are exposed to the sun and environmental aggressors on a daily basis, and often age must faster than the face. 'There is very little fat on the backs of the hands, so when even a small amount of collagen or elastin fibres begins to break down the dermis thins, causing veins to become more prominent, and the skin wrinkles. Women who have conquered the unlined look above the face, still neglect their hands, and once that damage has been done, often non surgical treatments are the only options to restore volume in the skin. 'Filler is the most popular option, dubbed the ‘hand lift’ by my patients, and most of those who have this treatment are in their 40’s. I always prefer to use a patient's fat, which means that there is very risk of causing an allergic reaction. This treatment, although a little more expensive than regular filler, is permanent. The results are unrivalled as the stem cells in the fat give the hands plumpness in addition to radiance. 'For those concerned about age spots and pigmentation, injectables are not going to improve the hands condition. A laser resurfacing treatment like Fraxel can penetrate the top layer of skin, destroying brown spots and stimulating collagen production so that the skin looks smooth and even. It can be uncomfortable; hands can be red and swollen for a few days following treatment but the pigmentation and brown spots will flake off in about a week – with permanent results.'","Serums for hand pigmentation and wrinkles hitting shelves .

"Jose Mourinho has confirmed that Diego Costa is fit to face Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. The striker has not played since coming back from international duty with Spain struggling with persistent hamstring problems. He has missed Chelsea's past four games, but the £32million summer signing is set to return against QPR. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho say Costa needs special care . Diego Costa has scored nine times in his first nine games for Chelsea, but has missed the last four . Costa returned to training this week and has been declared fit for the game against QPR on Saturday . Didier Drogba has deputised in the absence of the Spain international, scoring in each of his last three games . 'He is available,' confirmed Mourinho. 'That's good for us. It's difficult, when only one striker available. It is difficult. When you have two, obviously the situation improves. 'We don't have Mikel, it's not good for us. He's always an option. But the fact we recover Ramires is a compensation for that loss. So the situation is a bit better.' And Mourinho insisted that the striker would continue to be allowed to go on international duty, despite his injury problems. Mourinho has been rowing with Spain national team coach Vicente del Bosque in recent weeks. The Portuguese was not happy that Costa came back from international duty injured but del Bosque has hit back saying he will remain stubborn by playing the striker. Mourinho, however, will not stand in his Costa's way of joining up with the Spain team in future. He added: 'The only thing I can say is what everybody knows, which is the time he was having problems in Chelsea and the way we managed to keep him playing, but after the national team we lost him for four matches. Crystal Palace, Maribor, Shrewsbury and Man United. 'Four matches in three different competitions. Now he's again available, but he needs obviously to be again under special care. We are going to do that. It's the only thing we can do, nothing else.' Drogba's goal against Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday night was his third in three competitions last week . Mourinho praised his Ivorian striker, who 'can show his importance by being there when the team need him' Costa was injured on Spain duty, but Mourinho insisted he will not stop players going on international duty . Cesc Fabregas will hope to resume his deadly partnership with his international team-mate Costa . Costa's return is likely to mean a rest for Didier Drogba, who filled in for Costa in the summer signing's absence. Drogba was the subject of continued praise from his manager, after scoring in three consecutive games. Mourinho said the Ivorian striker had demonstrated that he 'can show his importance by being there when the team need him'. And with Loic Remy still missing until after the next international break, Drogba will almost certainly still have some part to play.

"Peter Crouch had a hand in three of the four goals as Stoke City drew 2-2 with QPR at Loftus Road. Mame Biram Diouf opened the scoring with his second Premier League goal of the season. Peter Crouch beat Rio Ferdinand in the air to provide the perfect knock-down for the former Manchester united forward to head home from close range. Steven Caulker's header was then prodded past a helpless Asmir Begovic by Crouch just before the break. But the colossal striker redeemed himself as he evaded Ferdinand in the box to sweep home a Victor Moses cross and restore the visitors' lead. Harry Redknapp's side appeared to be heading for a draw before Niko Kranjcar equalised with a brilliant late free-kick.

Stoke's second goalscorer Peter Crouch has been named as the man-of-the-match for today's game. What. A. Goal. Kranjcar is chopped down on the edge of the box by Steve Sidwell - who receives a yellow card for his sins.

QPR are trying to increase the pressure again, just like during the first-half, but Stoke are looking very comfortable and very good value for their lead. Stoke are currently running riot at Loftus Road and should be 3-1 up. Charlie Adam is found in acres of space inside the QPR box and pulls the ball back into the path of Steven Nzonzi who blazes high and wide. Will they rue these missed chances? Victor Moses deserves most of the credit for this goal. The Nigeria international wins the ball from Mauricio Isla before getting to the byline and firing a low cross into the path of Crouch who emphatically finds the net with an expert left-footed shot. QPR boss Harry Redknapp has been forced to make another change once more with Jordon Mutch the latest player to injure his hamstring. Karl Henry his replacement. Should Steven Caulker's goal be credited to him? The centre back's header was on-target but Peter Crouch kicked the ball into his own net? It's one for the dubious goals panel that's for sure... We're back underway at Loftus Road... QPR lucky to go into the second half equal with Stoke. The Potters had chances to extend their lead before that equaliser so no wonder Mark Hughes was letting the expletives fly. Peter Crouch been decisive at both goal mouths, assisting the opener but then helping Steven Caulker's header into the net. QPR probably need to improve in the second half if they are to get anything from this match. Steven Caulker's goal has levelled matters at Loftus Road. The visitors will feel the scoreline doesn't reflect the balance of play though, with the Potters being hugely impressive on the counter-attack. We're all square in West London! Jordon Mutch wins his side a corner. From the ensuing set-piece Steven Caulker heads home at the back post to the eruption at Loftus Road. There's some controversy over the goalscorer though with Crouch inadvertently getting the final touch. QPR midfielder Joey Barton's afternoon is over after tweaking his hamstring once more. Matt Phillips come on as his replacement. Peter Crouch is appearing in the groove against his former side, seeing his low right-footed shot fly past the post after great play again by Victor Moses.QPR immediately go up the other end and Niko Kranjcar hits a 25-yard drive that goes inches past the post. Half an hour played and the game has been an entertaining affair. Stoke are soaking up the QPR pressure and hitting the hosts on the counter-attack on numerous occasions. Despite their increased pressure, Stoke are looking increasingly threatening on the counter-attack. Diouf dwindling on the ball when the visitors breaking this time. Victor Moses wreaking havoc down the wing, good to see the youngster in such good form. Peter Crouch all over former England teammate Rio Ferdinand at the moment, out sprinting him just minutes before rising above him for the header to assist the goal. Meanwhile Stoke fans taunt the home support - 'is this a library?' The hosts have come back into the game since going a goal behind but have yet to trouble Begovic sufficiently. Stoke are close to doubling their lead soon after but Victor Moses has his stinging shot saved by Green. Peter Crouch 2-0 Rio Ferdinand. After blitzing Ferdinand moments before, Crouch beats the centre-back in the air to nod down for Mame Biram Diouf to score past Rob Green in the QPR goal. Rio Ferdinand's diminishing pace has been spoken a lot and it was on evidence after eight minutes when Peter Crouch, not known for his speed, glides past the former England defender before over-hitting a cross out for a goal kick. Mark Hughes gets his first taste of the Loftus Road faithful's views on him, with the crowd chanting 'Stand up if you hate Mark Hughes!'Two years on since his sacking in 2012 and the wounds still haven't been healed it seems. Vargas has the first shot on goal after 54 seconds but his tame strike is comfortably gathered by Asmir Begovic in the Stoke goal. QPR's Vargas and Charlie Austin get proceedings started... The last time both QPR and Stoke were in the Premier League, the Potters completed a double over the West London outfit. Victory today would see them achieve three wins in a row against the R's for the first time since 1974. The hosts have played one and lost one at home so far this season, but hold an impressive record against their opponents at Loftus Road. Harry Redknapp's side have won eight and lost just two of their last 13 home league games against the Potters (D3) Ever wondered what a Premier League footballer's matchday routine is before kick-off? QPR revealed earlier on their official Twitter account, what the professionals entail in the countdown to the match. (Note: The referee's coin toss happens precisely 80 seconds before the game begins...) QPR fans will get their first chance to see on loan signing Eduardo Vargas at Loftus Road today following his summer move from Italian side Napoli. The 24-year-old was one of Chile's stars at the World Cup and the home fans will be hoping he can repeat that form as they bid to avoid relegation this season. Plenty of fans crowded the entrance to Loftus Road waiting for the players buses to arrive. Former manager Mark Hughes, returning here for the first time since he was sacked by Tony Fernandes in 2012, got plenty of stick. He's about as welcome in this part of West London as John Terry, or rickets (the disease, not Michael). Some QPR fans perceive the financial and confidence problems the club currently faces as being a hangover from Hughes's 10 month stint here. Stoke have been dealt a blow with news that Jonathan Walters is unavailable for selection having failed to overcome a calf injury.

"Walkers at the top of a Japanese volcano were forced to run for their lives after it started to erupt without warning yesterday, sending a cloud of ash and rock streaming down the mountainside. Within seconds, the cloud covered an area more than two miles wide from the summit of Mount Ontake with witnesses claiming that visibility was reduced to zero. Seven people are missing since yesterday's eruption which seriously injured 32 people with seven of those losing consciousness. Some 250 hikers were forced to run for their lives after Mount Ontake erupted yesterday lunchtime without any prior warning, covering the area in rock and ash . Seconds after the image left, visibility was reduced to almost zero as the walkers were engulfed in a cloud of volcanic dust and rock, right . The ash cloud spread out immediately in every direction shooting thousands of feet into the sky before covering a two square mile area in dense, choking dust . Rescuers believe that at least 40 people are stranded near the 3,067 metre summit of Mount Ontake due to the lingering ash cloud. Sohei Hanamura, crisis management official in the Nagano prefecture which controls the area said police, fire, and military rescue workers can only ascend the mountain on foot as it is too dangerous to deploy helicopters to the area. Rescuers fear that the helicopters would suffer catastrophic engine damage if they ingested the highly abrasive volcanic dust. The 3,067 metre mountain is 125 miles west of Tokyo and has already forced airlines to divert aircraft from the area. One of the hikers was filming the mountain at the time of the eruption and captured some of the terrified walkers as they fled for their lives. Only a matter of seconds after hearing the noise, the cloud of abrasive dust closes in on them, blocking out the day light. As the cloud struck, the person holding the camera is forced to turn away from the onrushing dust and dive to the ground in order to breathe. More than 250 people were on the mountain when the volcano started to erupt yesterday lunchtime forcing walkers to improvise protective masks . Those near the bottom of the mountain were able to continue downwards, but an estimated 40 of those near the summit were stranded with seven reported missing . The camera shows that instantly every exposed area in the mountain top is soon covered in the dust and people can be heard coughing and spluttering. Mikio Oguro, an NHK journalist who was on the slope on an unrelated assignment, told the station that he saw massive smoke coming out of the crater, blocking sunlight and reducing visibility to zero. He said: 'Massive ash suddenly fell and the entire area was totally covered with ash,"" he said by phone. He and his crew had to use headlights to find a lodge to take refuge. 'My colleagues later told me that they thought they might die.' Rescuers said that 32 people were seriously injured while seven of those were rendered unconscious with a further seven reported missing since yesterday . Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has instructed the military to launch a rescue operation to escort the stranded walkers to safety in case the situation deteriorates . Mount Ontake, pictured, began erupting round noon on Friday spewing rocks and ash over a two-mile radius of the mountain's summit . Japan's meteorological agency raised the alert level for Mount Ontake to three on a scale of one to five. It warned people to stay away from the mountain, saying ash and other debris could fall up to 2.5 miles away. One eyewitness told Japanese TV channel NHK: 'It was like thunder. I heard boom, boom, then everything went dark.' So far there has been no sign of any lava in the volcano, which last erupted in 2007, but scientists are monitoring the situation closely. Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe returned earlier today from a visit to the US. He has instructed the military to begin rescuing the stranded hikers and remove them from the area in case the situation deteriorates further. Mr Abe said: 'Nearly 200 people are in the process of descending the mountain, but we are still trying to figure out details. I instructed to do all we can to rescue the people affected and secure the safety of the trekkers. Nagano police sent a team of 80 to the mountain to assist the climbers who were making their way down, while Kiso Prefectural Hospital, near the mountain, said it had dispatched a medical emergency team. The 3,067 metre Mount Ontake is about 120 miles west of Tokyo and is popular with hikers and adventurous tourists looking for a walking holiday . Walkers in the area were forced to improvise to protect themselves from the volcanic ash which was falling from the sky following yesterday's eruption . A TV crew working in the area at the time of an unrelated story thought they were going to be killed when the ash and rocks began falling from the sky . A hospital official said: 'We expect a lot of injured people so we are now getting ready for their arrival.' More than five hours after the initial eruption, the thick ash cloud showed no signs of abating, NHK TV showed. Mari Tezuka, who works at a mountain rescue hut on the mountain said: It's all white outside, looks like it has snowed. There is very bad visibility and we can't see the top of the mountain, . 'All we can do now is shut up the hut and then we are planning on coming down... This is a busy season because of the changing autumn leaves. It's one of our busiest seasons.' Scientists said there has not been any lava seen yet during this most recent event although Mount Ontake last erupted back in 2007 . Mount Ontake is 120 miles west of Tokyo although so far flights in and out of the city have not been affected by the eruption although local flight restrictions are in place . Poisonous gases and ash are being pumped thousands of feet into the sky as the volcano threatens to explode for the first time in almost a decade .","Mount Ontake started erupting at lunchtime on Friday spewing out small rock and ash over a two-mile wide area .
Rescuers said that 32 people were seriously injured, seven of those were rendered unconscious by the fumes .
The volcano is 120 miles west of Tokyo but has not yet caused any disruption to flights in and out of the city .
