"(CNN) -- The retirements are coming thick and fast out of Old Trafford, with Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand the latest to call time -- on his international career. The 34-year-old's retirement follows the farce that ensued in March when he was recalled by England manager Roy Hodgson for the World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro, only for Ferdinand to quickly withdraw due to his ""pre-planned fitness program"" with his club. In a statement released by the English Football Association, Ferdinand explained that he wanted to retire from international football to ""concentrate on my club career."" ""After a great deal of thought, I have decided the time is right for me to retire from international football,"" added Ferdinand, who has not played for England since a Euro 2012 qualifier against Switzerland in June 2011. ""The team looks in great shape and there is an influx of young, talented players coming through the ranks which bodes well for the future. ""I regard it as a great honor and a privilege to have represented my country at every level from Under-17s upwards. ""I have always been very proud to play for England. I would like to wish Roy and the team all the best for future tournaments. ""A big thank you to all the fans, managers, coaching staff and players that I have worked alongside - the journey has been incredible."" In October, Hodgson was forced to apologize to Ferdinand after an English newspaper reported he had told fellow commuters during a tube journey on London's underground that the Manchester United defender's international career was over. Ferdinand had been controversially left out of England's squad for Euro 2012 despite the United defender expressing his desire to add to his 81 international caps. After leaving Ferdinand out of his Euro 2012 squad, Hodgson opted to take Chelsea captain John Terry, though the defender had been due in court to face allegations he racially abused Rio's brother, Anton Ferdinand. Hodgson insisted it was purely a football decision and Terry was cleared in July. But he was banned for four matches on the same charge by the FA and announced his retirement from international football. After making his debut against Cameroon at Wembley in 1997, Ferdinand went on to win 81 caps for England, playing in three World Cups. ""It's important to pay tribute to someone of Rio's stature and the achievements he had in a senior international career with England over 14 years at the highest level,"" said Hodgson . ""To have captained his country, to play at three World Cups and indeed score in one of those, marks him out amongst a very special group of players. ""I appreciated the call from Rio to inform me of his decision, which clearly he had spent much time considering before reaching this point.""","Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand retires from international football .

"(CNN) -- Iranian citizens who support peaceful change that will allow them to enjoy their human rights expect the international community, and in particular the United Nations, to hold the Islamic Republic to account. The new session of the U.N. Human Rights Council began on March 1. A failure of the world's most influential human rights body to deal with the abuse of human rights in Iran will be interpreted by Tehran as a green light for the government's brutal policies that could result in more executions of political prisoners. Scores of peaceful demonstrators have been killed on the streets or in prison since the disputed June 2009 presidential elections. Four political prisoners have been executed and others, including 20-year-old Mohammad Amin Valian, who has been convicted of ""enmity against God"" for throwing rocks at a demonstration, face death penalties. More than 1,000 Iranians are behind bars for expressing their political views. Leading politicians and clerics are calling for the harshest sentences for more of these prisoners. In February, Iran's human rights record was examined under the Universal Periodic Review procedure. A number of U.N. members expressed deep concern about post-election abuses and chronic problems such as torture, the execution of juvenile offenders and discrimination against women. Other countries praised Iran's progress in improving social welfare. At the end of the exercise, Iran rejected outright recommendations to end juvenile executions, end torture, release illegally detained persons, and prosecute officials guilty of rape, torture and murder in prisons. They rejected recommendations to end legal discrimination against women. They rejected the idea of inviting U.N. special rapporteurs -- none of whom as has been allowed to visit Iran since 2005 -- to examine the allegations. While atrocities since June have horrified people around the world, leading to demonstrations by more than 50,000 people in 110 cities last summer, Iran seems, astonishingly, to be strengthening its standing in the Human Rights Council. The 47 member states have shown no willingness to hold a special session, as many international human rights experts have recommended, nor have they supported the idea of a special U.N. envoy to look into the situation, and to press Iran to abide by its commitments. One reason seems to be that the international community is preoccupied with persuading Iran to keep its nuclear development program from creating an atomic weapon. Even without a bomb, Iran already seems to have achieved a form of nuclear deterrence: The nuclear issue creates conflict that justifies police state methods to keep the population under control, while reducing international pressure to end such abuses, which other states fear will spoil delicate negotiations. The strategy is working for the Iranian government. Now they have their sights set on gaining a place on the Human Rights Council itself in elections by the U.N. General Assembly that will take place in May. The failure of the Human Rights Council to take serious action to condemn Iran's human rights abuses, and the election of Iran to the Human Rights Council itself, will be deeply disillusioning for the reform and human rights movement in Iran. It could destroy their faith in the international human rights system, for which many have sacrificed their freedom and security, and for which many have died. It will give legitimacy to hanging political prisoners, and more will be hanged. But this issue is not just about Iran. It is about the capacity of the U.N. system to protect human rights. If Iran's grave abuses are ignored and if Iran assumes a place on the council, the council will be further weakened. Other dictatorial regimes will be emboldened to repress their citizens. That is why it is crucial that members of the U.N. Human Rights Council make it clear to Iran, in a resolution that cannot be brushed off, that torturing and executing political prisoners is not acceptable. And that is why the U.N. General Assembly must reject Iran's candidacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hadi Ghaemi and Aaron Rhodes.","Co-authors say U.N.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Mourners paid respect Thursday to victims of a government crackdown in Iran following last year's disputed presidential elections, as security forces kept a close watch. It was the last Thursday before the start of the Persian new year, a day on which Iranians traditionally visit the grave sites of loved ones. At the Beheshteh Zara cemetery in southern Tehran, the mourners included several who paid respects to Neda Soltan, a 26-year-old woman whose death last year became emblematic of a harsh government response to protests that followed the June 12 vote. Soltan became known simply as ""Neda"" after a video camera captured her final moments on June 20; she was shot to death during a post-election protest. Iran has been wracked by anti-government demonstrations since the disputed presidential vote resulted in hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's re-election. Special coverage: Protests in Iran . The government has beefed up security to ensure ""order and calm"" during the two-week period celebrating Norooz, a holiday that begins with the first day of spring and the Persian new year. Authorities have stationed 200,000 security personnel across the country, according to Ahmadinejad's official news site. In Beheshteh Zara, members of the security forces in plainclothes watched parts of the cemetery where post-election protesters are buried. A person in plainclothes quietly instructed people to pay their respects at Soltan's grave site and leave. Another person in plainclothes videotaped people at her grave site. Meanwhile, Mehdi and Zahra Ramezani visited the grave site of their son, Ramin, who was killed on June 15. ""People are kind to come here,"" Mehdi Ramezani said. ""I am thankful for the people who remember my son.""","Iran by wracked by dissent since disputed presidential vote last June .

"(CNN) -- Animal Kingdom roared into the record books at Meydan Racecourse Saturday, blowing away the rest of the field to become only the second Kentucky Derby winner to triumph in the Dubai World Cup, the world's richest race. The giant chestnut started strongly and tucked in behind the early pace setter, Royal Delta, before being unleashed in the straight by jockey Joel Rosario. He held off a final gallant challenge from the globe-trotting Red Cadeaux to win by four lengths. Planteur reprised his third place finish from last year, while the Andrew Balding-trained Side Glance ran the race of a lifetime to finish fourth. With $10 million in prize money on offer, the most lucrative race in the world attracted a strong international field, with representatives from the UK, the U.S., Australia and Dubai. But it was a sparkling performance by arguably the classiest horse in the field that saw racing's richest prize returned to American hands after a four-year dearth. Trained in the U.S. by English-born Graham Motion, the Kentucky Derby winner from 2011 has shown a unique ability to run convincingly on all three surfaces: dirt, synthetic and turf. However, attempts to live up to his promise on the international stage had been hampered by injury and he has run just twice since he was ruled out of last year's running of the Dubai World Cup. He will now be targeted at Britain's Royal Ascot meeting in June before heading to Australia to embark on a career at stud.","Former Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom wins the Dubai World Cup .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- The activities of the week-old BBC Persian TV channel are illegal, a top Iranian official said Wednesday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. BBC says the news it broadcasts on the channel is gathered from abroad, using sources within Iran. The minister of culture and Islamic guidance, Mohammad Hossein Saffar Harandi, also banned Iranian journalists and artists from working for the channel. A BBC spokesman in London, England, said the corporation is breaking no laws in Iran. BBC Persian TV launched January 14, broadcasting in Farsi to Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, the BBC spokesman said. It joins the 69-year-old BBC Persian radio service and the Web site BBCPersian.com, launched in 2001. The TV channel offers mixed programming, with news and current affairs for eight hours a day and documentaries and debates on arts, culture and science filling out the schedule, the spokesman said. Harandi did not say the BBC channel was breaking any laws in the remarks carried by Fars. ""Considering the BBC's history of creating chaos in Iran, and its efforts to set the various strata of Iranian society against each other, the presence of the BBC Persian TV in the Islamic Republic is deemed to be illegal,"" he said. Harandi added that various government officials had declared that cooperating with the channel would lead to problems for Iranian professionals, the news agency said. ""We are closely monitoring the English language BBC as well, which is working in Iran legally, and if they produce programs for the use of the BBC Persian TV, we shall then take action against them (BBC English),"" he said. ""And in that case, the country's security officials will respond appropriately."" The BBC spokesman said it is against the law for the channel to report and gather news in Iran, so the news it broadcasts on the channel is gathered from abroad, using sources and contacts within Iran. Correspondents for BBC Persian do not work in Iran, he added. ""We would like to have BBC Persian correspondents in Iran, and we continue to seek a dialogue with the Iranian authorities to get accreditation for that,"" said the spokesman, who asked not to be named. ""What we are doing is not illegal,"" he said. The Iranian minister's comments call to mind modern broadcasting folklore about the BBC's role in the Iranian revolution. A BBC Radio 4 documentary in 2005 said it had evidence that a radio newsreader inserted the word ""exactly"" into a midnight timecheck one summer night in 1953, a code word to the shah of Iran that Britain supported his plans for a coup. The shah had selected the word, the documentary said, and the BBC broadcast the word at the request of the government. Officially, the BBC has never acknowledged the code word plot. The BBC spokesman declined to comment on a possible connection. Harandi said the planning of the BBC Persian TV channel ""was not done with good will,"" Fars reported. The minister asked Iranian artists to obtain the proper permits for working with any foreign arts and cultural group, ""otherwise they shall have to accept responsibility for their cooperation with those foreign organizations,"" according to Fars. -- CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran and Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report.","Iran also bans Iranian journalists and artists from working for the channel .

"New York (CNN) -- Zahra Shams is a 21-year-old student of law at Ferdowsi University in Mashhad, Iran. She was arrested on May 6, 2010, and held in solitary confinement. She is not a political activist. The reason for her arrest: Her sister Fatemeh Shams, a poet, blogger and graduate student at Oxford University, is a solid supporter of the Green Movement in Iran. Fatemeh Shams became even more vocal since last summer's presidential election, when her husband, Mohammad Reza Jalaipour, also a graduate student at Oxford, was arrested in the airport as the couple was leaving Iran to resume their studies in the U.K. He was jailed for more than two months and subsequently released, but not permitted to leave Iran to join his wife in Oxford to resume his studies. The authorities in Iran evidently arrested Zahra Shams to force her sister Fatemeh into silence in Oxford. She did not become silent. Last week the authorities released Zahra Shams. Majid Tavakoli is a 24-year-old student activist from Amir Kabir Technical University in Tehran. He has been repeatedly jailed for long periods of time. Arrested on December 7, 2009, during the student protests over the disputed presidential election of 2009, Tavakoli became the subject of global solidarity when authorities in Iran sought to humiliate him by taking his picture garbed in mandatory women's veils. Almost instantly, countless Iranian men wore veils and published their pictures on the internet in solidarity with Tavakoli. Similarly, when Tavakoli went on a dry hunger strike to protest his solitary confinement, his mother, too, initiated a hunger strike in solidarity with her son, which many young Iranians from around the globe followed. The authorities yielded and transferred Tavakoli from solitary confinement to a regular ward. Zahra Shams, an apolitical law student, and Majid Tavakoli, a major political activist and a pain in the neck of the Islamic theocracy in Iran, are two typical examples of the two ends of the spectrum on which young Iranians are challenging the 31-year-old theocracy that has ruled their land. The hopes and aspirations of these young women and men -- in a nation where young people make up some 70 percent of the total population -- are now branded a ""fetneh/menace"" by the loud propaganda machinery of the Islamic Republic. Fortunately for Iran, and fortunately for the world, that old and noisy machinery isn't working. Zahra Shams and Majid Tavakoli, and the generation they represent, are in charge of representing themselves and telling the world what they want. June 12, 2010, is the first anniversary of the election that sparked the Green Movement in Iran, a nonviolent civil rights uprising that caught the world by surprise. In a region infested with violence --genocidal, homicidal or suicidal -- it is impossible to exaggerate the significance of a massively popular civil rights movement that has begun and continued with the most fundamental democratic question of ""Where is my vote?"" It is a seminal question that had never been asked on such monumental scale in any other aspiring democracy in the region. With the ring of that simple but resounding question, ""Where is my vote?"" millions of Iranians have forced the hand of the Islamic Republic, exposing its naked brutality. If the world were to listen and watch carefully, it would see that the ancient Greek theory of democracy; the French Revolution's cry for liberty, equality and fraternity; the American revolt against despotism and tyranny; and ultimately the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s are today all resonating in the Iranian cry for freedom. For daring to doubt the veracity of the official results of last year's presidential election, innocent citizens have been subject to systematic and unbridled violence by the security apparatus of a theocratic regime that seems to be, more than anyone else, cognizant of its own absence of legitimacy. Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, the leading two opposition figures, just canceled their call for a mass silent rally on the first anniversary of the Green Movement for fear of organized state violence against peaceful demonstrators. The Islamic Republic is of course no exception to the rule of state-sponsored violence against innocent civilians in the region. Against that backdrop, the Green Movement in Iran has opened a new and unprecedented chapter in the political culture of the region that old colonial officers branded ""the Middle East."" Violent coups, militant rebellions, military invasions and brute insurrectionary uprisings are the staple of the political culture in this region. In a region where the enduring formation of democratic institutions and of nonviolent transition to democracy has always been thwarted by the rise of one charismatic tyrant or another, from Jamal Abd al-Nasser to Ayatollah Khomeini, the Green Movement boasts no such leader. And it is teaching those who care to watch an entirely new lesson in the art and craft of small steps and careful coalition-building on the long and arduous path to democracy. By contrast, the West's claim to moral superiority has been undermined by the continued carnage in Iraq and Afghanistan, both still effectively under U.S.-led occupation, and of Israel's wanton disregard for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. What's a little torture in Kahrizak and Evin over the last year compared to what the United States has done in Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay and Bagram Airbase in the course of its ""war on terror"" over the last decade? The United States has invariably supported undemocratic regimes to safeguard its immediate interests, compromising its longstanding ideals and principles. Today, Iranian demonstrators braving brutal repression in their streets and on their rooftops are truer to the ideals and aspirations of Thomas Jefferson and Martin Luther King Jr. than those in positions of power and authority in the United States. One can scarce imagine a more urgent issue facing the United States than the possibility of an Islamic Republic achieving nuclear arms. But is President Obama a credible leader to force Iran to stop its nuclear ambition when he continues with the double standard of never bringing Israel or Pakistan, two nuclear power allies of the United States who are not even signatories to the nonproliferation treaty, to the negotiating table? The Green Movement is providing President Obama with a historic opportunity to show the courage of his imagination and opt for regional and ultimately global disarmament, predicated on a nonviolent principle that community organizers (he must remember that term) in Iran seem to have learned from Martin Luther King more earnestly than he has. One year later, the Green Movement is unfolding in multiple and varied ways, and nothing will stop it. It may thunder as a cascade or flow quietly on a plateau -- but like any other bountiful river it will not stop until it reaches its destined ocean. From the gracious patience of Zahra Shams in solitary confinement in a Mashhad prison to the noble anger of Majid Tavakoli counting days to his people's freedom in a cell in Evin prison, the young Iranians are teaching nations the very alphabet of a language of liberation that the world leaders are yet to learn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Hamid Dabashi says young people continue the fight for freedom in Iran .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic gave a perfect illustration of why he's the top ranked player in the world as he dismantled France's Jeremy Chardy to reach the Wimbledon fourth round Saturday. The Serbian made it look ominously easy against an opponent seeded 28th for the grass court grand slam and ran out a 6-3 6-2 6-2 winner in a shade under an hour and a half. The match statistics revealed he did not make a single unforced error until the sixth game of the third set when he double faulted on his own service and winners flowed freely from his racket, nearly 40 in all. Chardy, who has upset a number of leading players in his career, British hope and No.2 seed Andy Murray included, was simply outclassed on Centre Court. Djokovic, bidding to add to his single title at SW19, won in his outstanding year of 2011, will go into the fourth round and second week with confidence on a high. The Australian Open champion will play German veteran Tommy Haas for a place in the quarterfinals after the 13th seed beat Feliciano Lopez of Spain, 4-6 6-2 7-5 6-4. Big-hitting Czech Tomas Berdych is also in Djokovic's section of the draw and he came through after a four-set battle with Kevin Anderson of South Africa, 3-6 6-3 6-4 7-5. The seventh seed must first get past unseeded young Australian Bernard Tomic, who underlined his potential by dispatching ninth ranked Richard Gasquet of France. After his 7-6 5-7 7-5 7-6 win over Gasquet, Tomic said he was confident of repeating the dose. ""Now I'm playing someone different, Tomas Berdych, who is a very, very good player. I'm going to have to study up on that, work with my team and my dad to give myself the best chance of winning,"" he said. Tomic's father John is barred from the All England Club after an alleged assault in Madrid on his son's former practice partner Thomas Drouet, but they have been working together outside of the grounds, the world number 59 revealed. Spain's David Ferrer had to battle long and hard to clinch his place in the last 16 after a five-set tussle with Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov. The never say die fourth seed had to come from two sets to one down before clinching the decider 6-2. Ferrer lost in the French Open final earlier this month to compatriot Rafael Nadal, who suffered a shock defeat on the first day of the championship. Defending men's champion Roger Federer followed him through the exit door on Wednesday, leaving the way apparently clear for Djokovic and Murray, both of whom have been impeccable form in the first week. In the women's singles, top seed Serena Williams was an equally emphatic winner against 42-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm of Japan. Williams, bidding for her 17th grand slam title in her Wimbledon defense, was only briefly troubled by her veteran opponent before racing to a 6-2 6-0 win under the Centre Court roof late Saturday. She will next play Sabine Lisicki after the German accounted for Australia's Sam Stosur. Earlier, the home crowd were left to celebrate the passage of 19-year-old Laura Robson to the last 16 after she beat New Zealand's Marina Erakovic, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 on a packed Court Two. 2011 champion Petra Kvitova, the eighth seed, and with a golden opportunity in her section of the draw after the exits of Maria Sharapova and Victoria Azarenka, battled past Russian Ekaterina Makarova 6-3 2-6 6-3.","Novak Djokovic beats Jeremy Chardy in straight sets .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Novak Djokovic was dumped out of the Madrid Open in the second round after an inspired performance by 21-year-old Grigor Dimitrov. The Bulgarian hadn't previously won a set against the six-time grand slam winner but took the match in three sets to secure the biggest scalp of his career to date. Djokovic, from Serbia, received treatment on his ankle during the second set but recovered to save a match point and send the match into a decider. But Dimitrov held his nerve to break Djokovic's serve twice in the final set and take the match 7-6 6-7 6-3. Roger Federer showed little signs of rustiness as he dispatched Radek Stepanek to move into the third round. The 17-time grand slam winner and defending champion cruised past his Czech opponent, wrapping up a 6-3 6-3 victory in 81 minutes. The Swiss was last in action in mid-March when he was knocked out of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells by Spain's Rafael Nadal. But despite his near two-month absence from competition, the 31-year-old was back in the groove swiftly to set up a meeating with either Japan's Kei Nishikori or Viktor Troicki of Serbia. ""I didn't think I played incredible, but that's not what I was expecting myself to do here. But I didn't play bad, either,"" Federer told the official ATP Tour website. ""So I'm very happy with how things went today. Stepanek is a player who can cause a lot of difficulties in the game. He has caused me difficulties in the past. Today that wasn't the case. I thought I was pretty much in control."" Federer, world No. 2, defeated Tomas Berdych in the 2012 Madrid final and is looking for a 22nd ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, which would see him draw level with Nadal's tally. Unlike Federer, the world No. 3, Britain's Andy Murray, was made to work hard for his place in round three after overcoming Germany's Florian Mayer 7-6 7-6. Murray saved five set points in the opener and came from a break down in the second set to register his 400th Tour victory in just over two hours. He will face French No. 16 seed Gilles Simon next. The 25-year-old told a press conference: ""I felt like I hit the ball very well today. I just didn't return so well. That was the only thing I would have liked to have done better."" ""He served well and hit a lot of aces on those points, but also I wasn't reading the serve. So even when I was getting to it I was a little bit late and missed a few too many returns. ""Apart from that, I moved very well, which I didn't do in Monte Carlo, so that's a big improvement."" Two top 10 seeds were knocked out on an eventful Tuesday. Czech Janko Tipsarevic, seeded nine, was beaten 7-6 6-3 by Argentinean Juan Monaco while Richard Gasquet, the French No. 8 seed was defeated 7-5 3-6 6-4 by Daniel Gimeno-Traver, from Spain. There were also wins for Stanislas Wawrinka, the Swiss No. 16 seed, and Tommy Haas, the No. 13 seed from Germany. In the women's draw, Serena Williams beat Spain's Lourdes Dominguez Lino 6-2 7-5. The world No. 1 was then asked about comments about her from American starlet Sloane Stephens. In an interview with ESPN magazine Stephens, who stunned Williams by beating her in the Australian Open quarterfinals, claimed Serena hadn't spoken to her since that match in January. But Williams refused to criticize the 20-year-old and told reporters: ""I'm a big Sloane Stephens fan and always have been. I've always said that I think she can be the best in the world. I'll always continue to think that and always be rooting for her. ""I really just always wish her and anyone, really, especially from America the best. We don't have that many American players, so it's always exciting to see so many young players doing so well."" Elsewhere, Mario Bartoli, the French No. 15 seed, recovered from an injury to her ankle as she beat Spaniard Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor 6-4 2-6 6-4. Germany's Sabine Lisicki and Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova were also winners, beating Dominika Cibulkova and Nadia Petrova respectively.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic dumped out of Madrid Open by Grigor Dimitrov .

"(CNN) -- How would you like to be Janet Napolitano on the day the first person is stabbed or slashed on a commercial airline flight? Usually, it would be unfair to personalize the question like that; second-guessing a public policy decision after the fact is always easy. But in the case of the dimwitted decision to lift the prohibition against passengers carrying knives onto airplanes, Napolitano, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, will be the one to get the direct blame if something terrible happens in the air, because she has been given ample notice that people who make their living flying think the idea is inexplicable and highly dangerous. In early March, the Transportation Security Administration -- a part of the Homeland Security bureaucracy -- announced that it would soon allow knives with blades shorter than 2.36 inches in length, and no wider than a half-inch, to be carried onto flights. There was immediate outcry from members of Congress, pilots and flight attendants. Many people may have assumed that, because the decision was so nonsensical, it would soon be scrapped. But it hasn't been; April 25 has been set as the day when, for the first time since restrictions were instituted after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, passengers carrying knives will be permitted to board any commercial flight. Napolitano and the TSA have shown no inclination to reconsider. It was passengers carrying blades, of course, who carried out the 9/11 attacks. But Napolitano has been adamant, even flippant, in dismissing the concerns about the wisdom of welcoming blades back onboard. The Christian Science Monitor reported that, at a breakfast sponsored by that publication, Napolitano rebuffed the critics by comparing them to a comedic character once played by a popular actress in the early years of ""Saturday Night Live"": . ""It's kind of like Gilda Radner, you know, if it is not one thing, it's another."" Napolitano's chief official at TSA, John Pistole, has said that by freeing TSA screeners from looking for small knives, they will be able to ""better focus their efforts on finding higher threat items such as explosives."" He also said: ""A small pocket knife is simply not going to result in the catastrophic failure of an aircraft."" Greene: Ebert's sheer love of life . U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm of New York -- he, like Pistole, is a former FBI agent -- recalled those blades (not explosives) that resulted in the 9/11 carnage, and characterized the refusal of Homeland Security and TSA to rethink their position as ""borderline idiocy."" Grimm is wrong only about the ""borderline"" part. Will every passenger with a knife present a danger? Of course not, and that isn't the issue. An infinitesimal percentage of passengers board a flight with deadly intentions. The enormously expensive and technologically sophisticated post-9/11 security measures are in place precisely because their presence is meant to deter those few passengers bent on destruction. Why would you possibly go to the trouble of electronically frisking everyone boarding a flight, and then wave the passengers carrying knives right onboard? Last week, members of the Association of Flight Attendants handed out leaflets at large airports around the country, asking for the public's help in trying to convince Homeland Security and the TSA to change their minds. The association said: ""The people on the front lines of aviation security know that allowing knives on planes is a bad idea."" And the Flight Attendants' Union Coalition released a letter from the family of Sara Elizabeth Low, an American Airlines flight attendant killed on 9/11. The family addressed the letter to TSA Administrator Pistole: . ""We are astounded by the lack of understanding and thoughtlessness that this terrible decision reflects. ... The terrorists have to be laughing at how naÃ¯ve our government continues to be. ... For the safety of flight crews, passengers and those potentially affected on the ground, please reconsider this terrible decision. Take a page from the doctors' oath and 'first do no harm.'"" The plan to allow the knives won't even speed up the airport screening process. Try to imagine the scene at the front of the lines, as already overworked TSA agents are forced to take tape measures or rulers and gauge the length and width of knives, as travelers insist their blades are shorter than 2.36 inches or that they aren't more than a half-inch wide. Try to envision the arguments that will ensue. So stubborn is Homeland Security and the TSA about refusing to reconsider the new policy that officials -- why they would choose to say these things out loud is incomprehensible -- are rationalizing their knives-on-planes initiative by publicly declaring that other items onboard could also be used to harm passengers and crew: ""If you are talking about a small knife, there are already things on a plane that somebody can convert into a small, sharp object,"" Napolitano said. Summer is coming, and with it flights that are jammed to capacity, passengers who are irritable and hot, delays that make blood pressure rise. It won't even have to be a terrorist -- just a drunken, enraged or emotionally disturbed passenger who has been given permission by the government to bring a knife along with him.

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia on Friday rejected sharp criticism by U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney that its intervention in Georgia raises doubts about Moscow's reliability as an international partner. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey  Lavrov has rejected U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism. In an exclusive CNN interview, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov acknowledged the conflict may have isolated Moscow from the international community. But he said Russia would be ready to work with any U.S. administration on strategic issues like non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. ""We are not interested in bad relations with the United States,"" Lavrov said. ""It wouldn't be our choice, but if the United States does not want to cooperate with us on one or another issue, we cannot impose."" Cheney met Thursday with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in Tbilisi and afterward criticized Russian military actions as an invasion of sovereign territory and ""an illegitimate unilateral attempt"" to change Georgia's borders by force. ""Russia's actions have cast grave doubt on Russia's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner,"" Cheney said. Diplomatic tensions between Moscow and Washington have climbed in recent weeks, with Russia accusing the U.S. of orchestrating the conflict in Georgia for political purposes.  Watch Cheney in Georgia » . Lavrov downplayed those accusations, laying responsibility for the violence at Saakashvili's feet. Lavrov said he did not believe anyone was able to control the Georgian leader.  Watch CNN's interview with Lavrov » . He also backed away from allegations made to CNN by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that U.S. personnel were involved in combat operations against Russian troops in Georgia. Lavrov said Russia entered Georgia simply to save the lives of Russian citizens. ""We acted because we had no other choice,"" Lavrov said. ""We had no other choice [than] to ensure not just the security of Abkhazians and South Ossetians, but their very survival. Georgia, too, many times in its history, including very recent history, tried to basically eliminate these people."" Abkhazia and South Ossetia lie within Georgia along its northern border with Russia, and have strong Russian-backed separatist movements. A 1992 agreement placed a mixed peacekeeping force of Russians, Georgians, and South Ossetians inside the territory. They maintained a fragile peace between separatists and Georgian forces until Georgia's military launched attacks inside the territory August 7. The Russian military responded by entering South Ossetia and Georgia. Lavrov did issue a warning that the turmoil in Georgia may not be at an end, saying Georgian forces had not confined themselves to areas agreed under the terms of the EU-brokered cease-fire. He added U.S. and NATO plans to rebuild the Georgian army were troubling, especially given ""daily rhetoric"" from Georgia that the conflict wasn't over. Russia has since become the only country to recognize the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a move that signals Moscow's firm support. Critics have accused Russia of using the international community's recognition of an independent Kosovo -- a move opposed by Russia -- as an excuse. Lavrov said the two couldn't be compared because Kosovo was not under attack, and those who recognized its independence ""were making a geo-political point."" Lavrov said Russia had no plans to enter Ukraine, which like Georgia, is a former Soviet republic eager to join NATO. Ukraine's National Security Chief Anatoly Grytsenko said he had strong evidence Russia was distributing thousands of passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Crimean peninsula, a part of Ukraine. The purpose, Grytsenko said, would be to create a Russian population on whose behalf Russia could intervene in the future. ""People saying things does not require me to comment on any stupidity,"" Lavrov said. ""I can only tell you that we don't need to artificially create some support for Russia in the Crimean peninsula."" Russia seeks no problems with Ukraine, Lavrov said. Cheney said this week that Washington welcomes NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine, but Lavrov said that would be ""a mistake."" Asked what action Russia might take if the two become members, Lavrov said: ""I hope this doesn't happen and I don't even want to discuss some hypothetical eventualities. NATO members have seen what Georgia did. NATO members, in spite of their public statements and solidarity position, know better... so it would be their decision, but I hope it would be an educated decision.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Furious over Russia's invasion of Georgia, the United States and its allies are weighing steps to diplomatically isolate Moscow as punishment for the conflict, senior administration officials said Tuesday. Russian soldiers take position during clashes in South Ossetia in Georgia on Monday. ""It is not business as usual anymore with the Russians, and there are consequences for doing what they are doing,"" one senior U.S. official said. Two senior administration officials said Tuesday that they could not speak for attribution because no final decisions had been made. But the United States will be discussing steps to take with its allies in the NATO alliance and the European Union, they said. The United States boycotted preparatory meetings Tuesday for a NATO meeting with Russia, and NATO has canceled a naval exercise with Russian forces in the northern Pacific. Washington and its allies also are discussing whether to drop Moscow from the Group of Eight industrialized economic powers, the official said. Russian President Dimitry Medvedev had pledged to strengthen Russia's role in the international community and world economy. But the U.S. official said that Russia, in its current situation, has ""much more to lose"" than the Soviet Union did when it invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968. ""Russia has one foot integrated into the international economy and community of states and one foot that is not quite in it,"" the official said. The Russians should consider ""whether they haven't achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives,"" the official added. The United States has criticized the Russian move against Georgia, its ally, as ""disproportionate"" and demanded a cease-fire, to which French President Nicolas Sarkozy said both sides agreed late Tuesday.  Watch Georgia's president discuss the cease-fire » . ""I wanted to make very clear that the United States stands for the territorial integrity of Georgia, for the sovereignty of Georgia; that we support its democratically elected government and people, and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Georgia,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday. ""But the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop."" President Bush said Monday that Russia's actions ""substantially damaged Russia's standing in the world"" and ""jeopardized its relations"" with the United States and Europe. Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, criticized the Bush administration for treating Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili like ""a naughty child"" as fighting raged between the two nations. ""We are not happy with the way the United States has been behaving, especially the way the United States has been propping up Mr. Saakashvili over the past few years,"" Churkin said.  Watch Churkin discuss the conflict » . However, the ambassador held out hope for restored relations. ""I hope we continue normal relations with the United States and the rest of the international community,"" he added. ""We have equal interests between the Russian Federation and the United States. We should look and try to resolve this international crisis."" The cease-fire agreement calls on both Russian and Georgian forces to withdraw to positions held before August 6. According to the second administration official, officials from several countries have told a variety of Russian officials, "" 'you know you cannot stay,"" to which the Russian response is, "" 'we don't want to stay.' "" The official called this a ""good sign and encouraging sign"" but warned that the international community needed to send Russia a clear message against ""mission creep.""","Official says no more ""business as usual"" with Russia, promises consequences .

"(CNN) -- It is testament to Novak Djokovic's prowess on the tennis court that the Serbian can still battle his way to victory despite admitting he is not 100% fit. The world No. 1 turned his ankle during Serbia's recent Davis Cup victory over the United States, throwing his participation at the Monte Carlo Masters into doubt. But on Wednesday Djokovic took to the court and though he was made to work hard for his three-set victory by Russia's Mikhail Youzhny he held firm to triumph 4-6 6-1 6-4. ""My movements on the clay are still not at the maximum and not where I want them to be,"" Djokovic told the ATP Tour's official website. ""But as the days go by, I think I'm going to slowly get into it and hopefully I can elevate the level of performance in the next match. Today was a big test, over two hours. I had a great quality opponent. ""I'm very happy to win. I'm just happy to compete, to be honest. I didn't know if I'm going to be playing the tournament up to yesterday basically. I know that my game is still not there, obviously, and I had a lot of ups and downs throughout the match. ""Physically also I think I've put double the effort than I do usually because I still don't feel comfortable. ""I haven't practiced much. An hour maximum a day. Obviously it's taking its toll on my game. But as I said, happy to win and see what tomorrow can bring."" Djokovic is looking to finally claim the Monte Carlo title after being beaten by Spain's Rafael Nadal in last year's final as well as in 2009. Nadal has won eight successive titles in Monte Carlo and recorded his 43rd straight tournament victory by dispatching Australia's Marinko Matosevic 6-1 6-2. The 11-time grand slam champion is on a 15-match winning run having taken titles in Sao Paulo, Acapulco and Indian Wells and enjoyed a comfortable win, despite going 2-0 down in the second set. ""I played well at the beginning with the right intensity, with no mistakes,"" said Nadal. ""I was trying to do the right things to find a good feeling on the ball, to find the right rhythm. I played to the right places, and that gave me confidence. ""I didn't play my best game, the first game of the second, and he played well, so he had the break. And after that he played well for a while in the next games. ""Then he had good chances, two break points for [a] 3 0 [lead]. It was not an easy moment. I played one good point and I was able to come back."" World No. 2 Andy Murray, from Britain, took just 73 minutes to ease past France's Edouard Roger-Vasselin, winning 6-1 6-4.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- Russia will not sign off on a proposed United Nations resolution calling for a cease-fire with Georgia, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Monday. An Ossetian woman cries on Monday during a funeral in Tskhinvali. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the proposed U.N. resolution, drafted by French officials, was lacking in a ""serious number"" of areas. ""I can't see us accepting this French draft of this resolution,"" Churkin told reporters late Monday. ""We will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this."" Russia's rejection of the U.N. resolution came on the eve of stepped-up efforts by the international community to resolve the conflict. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to arrive in Moscow Tuesday for talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the crisis. One of the issues Churkin mentioned was that the draft resolution did not mention Georgian ""aggression"" in South Ossetia. Russia argues that it is acting in response to a Georgian attack on South Ossetia, a breakaway Georgian territory whose separatist government is backed by Moscow. As one of five permanent members of the Security Council, Russia could veto any resolution. The draft -- backed by the United States and the other European members of the U.N. Security Council -- included calls for an immediate cease-fire between Russia and Georgia, a complete withdrawal of Russian and Georgian forces and participation in mediation. In Washington on Monday, U.S. President George Bush said Russia's attacks against Georgia have ""substantially damaged Russia's standing in the world."" Bush also warned Russia against trying to depose Georgia's government, saying evidence suggests Russia may be preparing to do so. ""Russia must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step in resolving this conflict,"" Bush said outside the White House. Russia said its military operations are peacekeeping after a Georgian attack on South Ossetia, where Moscow already had peacekeepers operating. Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said Monday he had signed an internationally brokered cease-fire proposal that was to be taken next to Moscow. Saakashvili said the cease-fire proposal would be taken to Moscow on Monday by the French Minister Bernard Kouchner and Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb. Stubb said they had a proposal that included a ""forceful way forward"" to a cease-fire and withdrawal plan. A Georgian National Security Council official said the document signed by Saakashvili called for an unconditional cease-fire, a non-use of force agreement, a withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgian territory, including the South Ossetia region and provisions for international peacekeeping and mediation. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice spoke by telephone Monday with most of the foreign ministers belonging to the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations about the conflict. The G-8 consists of the U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia. Russia, which officially joined the group in 1998, was absent from Monday's discussions. The ministers reiterated their support for Georgian sovereignty and called for a diplomatic solution, Deputy State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters. Rice and the ministers voiced deep concern for growing civilian casualties and pressed Russia to accept the cease-fire proposal.  Watch Russia blame Georgia for the crisis » . The United States hoped the Security Council would pass a ""strong"" resolution that ""makes the point that these attacks have to stop,"" Wood said. ""We want to see the Russians stand down.""  Watch George W. Bush condemn bombings » . The ministers with whom Rice spoke endorsed mediation efforts led by Kouchner, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, and Stubb, whose country holds the chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Monday slammed the ""cynicism"" of Western leaders who have expressed support for Georgia in the conflict. ""The scale of cynicism is surprising and the skill to present white as black and black as white. The trick to present the aggressor as the victim of an aggression and to place the responsibly for the effects on the victims,"" Putin said.","NEW: French President Nicolas Sarkozy due in Moscow Tuesday for talks .

"(CNN) -- Jupp Heynckes has poured cold water on suggestions he could take over at Real Madrid by announcing he will take a break from football after leading Bayern Munich to a historic treble. The veteran coach's team beat Stuttgart in the final of the German Cup last weekend to win a third major honor of the season, adding to the European Champions League and German Bundesliga trophies secured last month. ""The first thing I'm going to do is go on holiday,"" Heynckes, who first managed Bayern between 1987 and 1991, told reporters on Tuesday. ""I won't be taking up any engagement after July 1, neither here in Germany nor abroad. I'm going to withdraw, recover, and become a private individual.""

It was announced Monday Mourinho is returning to his former club Chelsea on a four-year deal. Heynckes led Real to Champions League glory in 1998 but was sacked for finishing fourth in the Spanish league. Paris Saint-Germain coach Carlo Ancelotti has also been heavily linked with the Madrid vacancy. Heynckes began his third spell as Bayern coach in 2011, replacing the sacked Louis van Gaal after the club had limped to a third-place finish in the Bundesliga. The former West Germany player also took charge of the team for five games in 2009 following the dismissal of Jurgen Klinsmann. ""The coaching job at FC Bayern costs a huge amount in terms of resolve, power and energy,"" Heynckes said. ""Especially over the last few weeks, I've sensed that I've been at the limit. It was incredibly demanding, incredibly all-encompassing. While Heynckes distanced himself from any current vacancy, he refused to rule out a future position, adding: ""I have something personal against finality."" ""Of all of us, he's the one who deserves his vacation the most,"" declared Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""The entire club is eternally grateful to Jupp. There couldn't be a better or more deserved way to say farewell."" Bayern president Uli Hoeness echoed Rummenigge's sentiments, saying Heynckes' achievements had cemented his place in the club's history.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic faces a race against time to be fit for this week's Monte Carlo Masters after revealing he is struggling to overcome an ankle injury. The World No.1 suffered the blow after rolling his right ankle during Serbia's Davis Cup victory over the U.S. last week. The 25-year-old, who is based in Monte Carlo, is keen to compete in the tournament and will make a decision on Tuesday after being given a first round bye along with the other top seven players. ""I can't guarantee 100 percent that I'll be on court. I have to be realistic and cautious,"" he told reporters. ""I've had three days of practice and I've been increasing the level each day. ""If I have discomfort over the next two days, that would be an indication if I should or should not play. This is a strong event and there is no room for compromise. ""This is the start of a new season on a new surface. To compete at a high level I must be 100% fit."" With the clay court season about to kick off, Djokovic is keen not to take any unnecessary risks ahead of the Masters events in Madrid and Rome before going into the French Open next month. The six-times grand slam winner added: ""I've been taping the ankle and doing all I can to be ready on the court. ""I know there is a lot of expectation for me to play - no one wants me to be out there more than I do. I consider this a very special place and I'm extra motivated.

"(CNN) -- When Andy Murray first won the Miami Masters in 2009, it set him on course for a career-high ranking of No. 2 in the world later that year. He kept that lofty status for less than a month, but Sunday's painstaking victory in the final against David Ferrer has taken him back there and earned the 25-year-old a second title at Key Biscayne. The British tennis star, who owns a home nearby, came back to practice for three weeks after his Australian Open final defeat in January. He had to save a match point in the final set before he finally triumphed 2-6 6-4 7-6 (7-1) against fifth-ranked Ferrer. ""It was a brutal match and at the end both of us were very, very tired. I just managed to get over the line. Physically it was an exhausting match,"" last year's losing finalist told CNN. ""I'm used to the conditions here and that helped."" He earlier said on court after the match: ""That sort of match a couple of years ago I probably would have lost. I was up a break three or four times in the third set and kept letting him back in through some loose shots. ""I tried to keep fighting, chased down every ball, made it as hard for him as possible. There was a lot riding on the match and I was glad to get through in the end."" The victory lifted Murray above 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer, who did not play in Miami after experiencing back problems during his quarterfinal defeat against Rafael Nadal at Indian Wells. It is the first time since November 2003 that neither Federer or Nadal have been in the top two. ""The No. 1 goal for me is to win the major events and then the ranking takes care of itself,"" Murray told CNN. ""Getting to No. 2 is a good achievement. I hope I can go higher but it's incredibly hard right now, with the guys around at the top of the game. I'll give it my best shot."" Ferrer, who had been seeking to become the first Spaniard to win the Miami title, was denied his second Masters-level crown after a demoralizing defeat that means he has yet to beat a top-five player in any of his 37 career finals. ""There will be another situation like today, but my life doesn't change for one match. I need to work hard and to be focused for the next tournaments,"" said Ferrer, who turns 31 on Tuesday. However, he did regret his decision to use a challenge on one of Murray's shots during his match point -- it was ruled in. ""The ball, it was really close. I saw it out... I made my decision in that moment. It's a bad moment now. I don't want to think anymore about that. I want to forget as fast as possible."" Ferrer could have moved above fourth-ranked Nadal if he had won, with his compatriot having sat out the tournament to rest his knee following his title at Indian Wells. The men's schedule will switch focus to the Davis Cup quarterfinals this week before the beginning of the European clay-court season, where Murray will be seeking to retain his status for the French Open. ""If I'd served better I could have made it easier and that's something I need to do better in the clay court season,"" he said. ""This week I did a lot of things well but I need to serve better. If I serve better I'll be able to win matches like today more comfortably. It's easier to return on clay so it's even more important to serve well.""","Andy Murray reclaims world No. 2 ranking with his second victory in Miami event .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to the theater, Jose Mourinho is the man who really does seem to sense that all the world's a stage. On his return to the Bernabeu following the winter break, Mourinho was cast as villain once again as the home crowd poured forth their ire onto the Portuguese coach. Forget that Real won this game against Real Sociedad 4-3 and did so after playing with ten men for most of the contest. 'I hate my social life,' says Mourinho . It was Mourinho's decision to leave goalkeeper Iker Casillas, a national and Real treasure on the substitute bench, which had irked those in the stands. The natives are unhappy with Mourinho's management style, not to mention the fact that Real sits 16 points off league leader and great rival Barcelona after just 18 games. Casillas, who started on the bench, entered the action after just six minutes when fellow goalkeeper Adan was sent off for a professional foul. The Spain international played the remaining 84 minutes, but Mourinho was still subjected to criticism from the stands. ""Perfect. Let them whistle me before the match and then support the team as they are doing. I think the whistles are for leaving Casillas out and also because we are not achieving our aims in the championship,"" Mourinho told reporters. ""There are others who didn't applaud and are not happy with his (Casillas') performances. If I am not doing well it is normal that they whistle and it is something you have to live with. I don't want to be a hero independently of my performances."" ""I told Adan before the game that the whistles he is likely to hear are for me and not for him but in my opinion there was a lack of respect for him. ""He is a player who has been 16 years at Real Madrid, he was born in Madrid and he didn't deserve that. ""Adan deserves to be happy but I don't know why in Spain that happened. The problem is that the press have turned an attack on Jose Mourinho into a lack of respect for Adan."" Cristiano Ronaldo and Daniel Craig - A right to privacy? While supporters may have been angry at Mourinho, they were at least treated to a thrilling affair with Real Sociedad playing a full part. Xabi Prieto scored a hat-trick for the visitor, but still couldn't prevent Real from taking all three points. Two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and further strikes from Karim Benzema and Sami Khedira sealed the win. Sociedad also finished the game with ten men after Dani Estrada was shown a second yellow card in the 80th minute. Vilanova returns . Elsewhere, Barcelona welcomed coach Tito Vilanova back from cancer surgery with a comfortable 4-0 win over city rival Espanyol. Vilanova underwent an operation to remove a tumor from his lung after suffering a recurrence of a problem on his parotid gland -- located at the back of his mouth. Is Barca boss Vilanova coach of the year? ""I would like to thank everyone for their support,"" Vilanova told reporters. ""This club has had a lot of knocks in the last couple of years but I always want to take the positive approach. What has happened to me could have happened to anyone. ""This is not over yet and there will be days that I can take training and others I can't, but I want the media to realize that this illness is mine and it is private."" Pedro Rodriguez hit a double with Xavi Hernandez and Lionel Messi also on target as Barca made it 17 league wins from 18 games. Atletico Madrid sits 11 points adrift in second following a 1-1 draw at Mallorca, while Celta Vigo eased its relegation worries with a 3-1 win over Real Valladolid. Llorente opens talks with Juventus . In Italy, Juventus suffered a shock defeat after going down 2-1 at home to Sampdoria. Sebastian Giovinco had given Juve a 24th minute lead from the penalty spot, but a classy double from Emanuel Icardi allowed Samporia to snatch all three points. Juventus sits five points clear at the summit with Lazio in second following its 2-1 win at Cagliari on Saturday. Juve's defeat will have come as a relief to Inter, which is already nine points off the pace and was beaten 3-0 by Udinese in Sunday's early game. Antonio di Natale scored twice and Luis Muriel was also on target as Udinese eased to victory. Napoli crushed Roma 4-1 thanks to a stunning hat-trick from Uruguay international Edinson Cavani. Elsewhere, AC Milan claimed a 2-1 win over Siena thanks to goals from Bojan and Giampaolo Pazzini, while there were also wins for Chievo, Genoa and Parma. Chelsea striker Sturridge joins Liverpool . In the English FA Cup, arguably the most famous domestic knockout competition in world club football, Premier League giant Liverpool was given a scare by fifth tier side Mansfield. The minnow put up a brave fight before going out 2-1 with Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez scoring for Liverpool, which faces third tier Oldham in the next round. In the day's other tie, Swansea and Arsenal finished level at 2-2 following a frantic second half. Spain striker Michu gave the home side the lead before goals from Lukas Podolski and Kieran Gibbs appeared to have put Arsenal through. But Danny Graham popped up with a late equaliser to ensure the teams meet again in a replay. Demba Ba debut double fires Chelsea into fourth round .

""So there should be no fears about any injury. I'm ready for the Nations Cup."" Love and romance flourishes in France .

Sharapova may have won four grand slams but following defeats in 2005, 2006, 2011 and 2012, she would love to add a success in Key Biscayne to those triumphs. Poland's Radwanska is the defending champion, furthering the Russian's Miami misery last year to add to previous final failures against Victoria Azarenka (2011), Svetlana Kuznetsova (2006) and Kim Clijsters (2005). ""I've been so close to winning. I would love to win it,"" Sharapova told reporters after seeing off the eighth seed. ""I've been coming to this tournament since I was a little kid. It would mean a lot to win it."" The world No. 2 had to work hard for victory against Errani, who she defeated in last year's French Open to achieve her career grand slam, having previously won Wimbledon (2004), the U.S. Open (2006) and the Australian Open (2008). She may have won their previous three meetings but Sharapova was still forced to save three set points on her own serve in the second set before eventually prevailing. ""I had a really difficult opponent,"" added the Russian, who has won all four of her previous semifinals at the event. ""She really made me work for this match. A few ups and downs in the match but I'm really happy to get through."" The victory, which took two hours and 29 minutes to complete, was the second in successive tournaments for the Russian over Errani. The previous success came en route to winning the Indian Wells title earlier this month, a tournament which pushed Sharapova one place up the world rankings. In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic's conqueror Tommy Haas moved into the last four with a convincing win against 11th seed Gilles Simon. Germany's Haas did not concede a break point to the Frenchman en route to a 6-3 6-1 victory. ""I played some good points when it came down to it, which I am proud of, and then served out the first set. I felt pretty comfortable after that,"" the 34-year-old former world No. 2 told the tournament's official website. ""I used my chances right away in the second set and took that momentum. Again, I played the way I wanted to, using my all-around game and variety. I think I did that pretty well tonight."" Next up for Haas is third seed David Ferrer, who came from one set down to defeat Austria's Jurgen Melzer 4-6 6-3 6-0. Spain's Ferrer will be hoping to reach the final of this event for the first time in his career, having been a semifinalist in 2005 and 2006. He also has more match wins than any other player on the ATP Tour this year, with Wednesday's win over Melzer his 24th of 2013. ""I was a little bit nervous in the first set and part of the second,"" said the 30-year-old Ferrer. ""But I tried to fight every point, to be focused and I had a good feeling in the final of the second set and of course in the third one.""","Sharapova beats Sara Errani to reach third straight Miami Masters semifinal .

"(CNN) -- Investec Loyal's line honors victory in the Rolex Sydney to Hobart ocean race has been confirmed after a protest by the race committee was dismissed Thursday. A three-hour hearing of the International Jury at the Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania decided that the crew of the 100-foot super maxi had not received outside assistance during the 628-nautical mile classic. The race committee's case had centered around a conversation between Investec Loyal's tactician Michael Coxon and a helicopter crew covering the race for Australian television. Coxon had enquired about the sails being deployed by their rivals and five-time winners Wild Oats XI as they battled rough seas on the Bass Strait. Official Rolex Sydney-Hobart website . Coxon is managing director of the company which made Wild Oats' main sail and was concerned that it would not stand up to the testing conditions without compromising safety. Investec Loyal's skipper Anthony Bell said the jury had accepted his explanation of the incident. ""One of the things that they did take (into consideration) was that Michael Coxon's question was not to gain any advantage for our boat at all, but more to test how his business client's product, that they bought off him, was going,"" Bell told the official race website. Following the hearing, Bell and his crew received their trophies for the line honors victory in front of a crowd lining Constitution Dock in Hobart. ""It is the long way around in some ways,"" Bell said. ""It is very relieving to get to this point. There are rules in every sport and, while it wasn't ideal to go through this, I think that ultimately it gets beyond any question and whatever those questions that were asked have been properly answered."" Investec Loyal beat Bob Oatley's Wild Oats by just three minutes and eight seconds, one of the closest finishes in the race's history. They had fought a tactical duel from leaving Sydney Harbor on Boxing Day until the finish over two days later. It is an against-the-odds victory for us,"" Bell added ""I am still waiting for one of my crew members to wake me up and say you're on watch!""

"(CNN) -- South Korea's Inbee Park entered the golfing record books Sunday as she wrapped up a four-shot victory in the U.S. Women's Open at Sebonack. It made it three out of three majors this season for the World No.1, matching the record of the legendary Babe Zaharias, who achieved the feat in 1950. Park, who won the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April and the Wegmans LPGA Championship earlier this month, will be looking to complete the grand slam in the upcoming British Women's Open and the Evian Championship in France. When Zaharias achieved her milestone only three majors were on the schedule. Mickey Wright (1961) and Pat Bradley (1986) are the only other players in LPGA history to win three majors in a season. The 24-year-old Park was always in control in testing last day conditions on the course in New York State. She shot a two-over par 74 for an eight-under 280 aggregate. Fellow South Korean I.K. Kim matched her 74 to finish runner-up. The remarkable Park was completing her sixth victory of the season and adding a second U.S. Open title to the crown she won back in 2008 at just 19. On the men's European Tour, England's Paul Casey finished with a spectacular eagle to end a two-year victory drought by claiming the Irish Open at Carton House. The Ryder Cup star was four back overnight but ripped through the field with a six-under 66 to finish three shots clear on 14-under-par. England's Robert Rock shared second with third round leader Joost Luiten of the Netherlands. Bill Haas also shot a 66 to win the AT&T National on the PGA Tour by three shots. He finished on 12-under with Roberto Castro second after a 69. Tiger Woods, whose foundation is a beneficiary of the tournament, sat out the event with a left elbow injury, but was on hand to congratulate Haas at the end.","Inbee Park clinches victory in U.S. Women's Open .

"(CNN) -- Sailor Paul Larsen hopes that 2012 will be the year that he and his team will break the world speed sailing record -- and he believes he has the right contraption to do it. The Vestas Sailrocket 2 is half boat, half plane, and hopefully it will soon to be the fastest sailing vessel on water too. ""Everything above the water is an aeroplane and everything below the water behaves just like a boat,"" says Larsen, a professional sailor who's now turned his attention to breaking the speed sailing record, describing it as his lifetime mission. To attempt the feat, Larsen and his small team of naval architects, engineers and yachtsmen and women, created the sailrocket -- a hybrid boat/plane. ""A large part of this boat is flying, it's supported by aerodynamics,"" says Larsen . ""When it's going at high speed, it's like a well-built paper airplane."" The record is open to any craft, as long as it's using wind and water, and there is at least one person on board. Currently it is held by American kite surfer Rob Douglas, who reached 55.65 knots (103 kilometres per hour) over the required 500 meter course in 2010. The group held the record briefly three years ago, but they've come across some strong competition for the title, with wind surfers proving to be the toughest opponents. Last month the team made another record attempt in southern Africa. Walvis Bay in Namibia provides the ideal wind conditions for the sailrocket. The group spent days trying to reach 60 knots -- the speed they believe will not only get them the record, but also keep it with them. ""The boat is based on this whole new idea,"" explains Larsen. ""It's got no overturning forces."" He says the wind and water forces are in alignment. ""It's like someone trying to push you over by pushing at the soles of your feet."" The craft may be using the latest technology, but its concept is based on a craft that was written about nearly five decades ago. American rocket scientist Bernard Smith wrote about a sailboat in 1963 that he believed could reach 40 knots -- a concept that was well ahead of his time. Larsen's team tracked down Smith in 2007 to tell the then 97-year-old that they had broken the 40 knots, using the ideas Smith came up with 44 years earlier. Building on that design, they have since been able to go 50 knots and are pushing to go even faster. In Namibia last month they were unable to go any faster than 51 knots, but Larsen is certain they're not far off the mark. He thinks it's a matter of redesigning the boat's foils. ""One of these days we'll get the foil right and I think we'll smash the record."" The professional sailor is determined that there is no vessel like it in the world. It's because of this Larsen is reluctant to talk openly about the specifics of the sailrocket's design as they continue their endeavor to break the record. He's now back in England working on new foils that will hopefully provide them with the edge they need to get the record. They aim to return to Namibia, perhaps as early as April, to try again. But the attempts are not without risks. Larsen likens the sailrocket's 500 meter course to an aircraft going down the runway, but with too much weight in its nose so it can't take off. ""It is dangerous,"" he concedes. ""You go out there and you don't realize the consequences if the smallest thing goes wrong."" He says the worst crashes are the ones when the boat dives directly into the water. ""That's a killer. At least in the air you slow down."" But despite the dangers, Larsen and his team won't stop until they hit the 60 knot mark and take with it the world speed sailing record.","Team behind Vestas Sailrocket 2 aims to break world speed sailing record .

"(CNN) -- Much advice for fathers is written about reluctant dads. But, of course, this is not all of us. Before I became a father, I struggled to find advice that really spoke to me, and I hope that the following bits of wisdom speak to other American dads, men who really want to be the best they can be. Let me begin with where it all began for me. In August, in the waning days of Ramadan, the month of fasting observed by Muslims, I was confronted with a devastating choice. While Hurricane Irene raged through the streets of New York, my wife was in labor in a Manhattan hospital room. She had been laboring for 22 hours, and now, after repeated attempts to control it, she was wrestling with a fever. My son, still inside her, was slipping away from us. His heart rate was rapidly increasing, a sign of his distress. My wife and I are the ""do everything natural"" couple. We took prenatal yoga, went for prenatal acupuncture, found a loving doula and ate copious amounts of kale, and my wife refused all drugs from the moment her pain began. But like countless others, we had to make a difficult call that day. ""Let's end this,"" I said. ""Let's take the baby out."" In less than an hour, just after the sun set, doctors performed a c-section and pulled our baby boy out. After they clipped the cord and I said the call to prayer in his ear, we brought him around the curtain to his mother. It is strange that we bring our children into rooms that are brightly lit, with sterile walls, surrounded by strangers wearing plastic gloves. I could only imagine my son's confusion. Thankfully, my son heard our voices, the same voices he had been hearing since he was able to hear while inside the womb. On the day of his birth, he opened his beautiful eyes bright and wide (thank goodness he has his mother's eyes) and studied us. It was like he was asking, ""who's responsible for me? Oh, there they are. Are they sure they know what they are doing?"" The answer in a word: No. We had no idea what we were doing. My wife and I are both Muslim, and we both come from large families. I am black, and she is Indian-American. We are tied together by faith and an overriding sense that we need to raise our son in a way that is different from how we were both raised. He is very different from us, born into a very different time. But how do we do this? As a father, I started by laying out some nurturing father principles and assumptions. They are based in my faith but resonate universally. First, my faith tells me that my son is without sin. My wife and I are his ""spiritual parents,"" with the tough job of guiding him down a righteous path. To do this, we had to be prepared. Getting married was step one. Waiting a bit before diving into parenthood was step two. Sure, we could have waited longer and discovered more about ourselves as a unit and therefore been better parents. But in truth, no one is ever ""ready."" Constantly strengthening our own sense of faith as he watches is step three. Second, my son is good. He is untainted. He does not lie or cheat or steal. He has never cursed, never talked about someone behind his or her back. He smiles at strangers; he's calm when we pray. I have to nurture and bring out the best in him. I have to pay attention to him, let him cry and express himself and listen to him even when I have little attention. Among the tools I have at my disposal is my example. He will follow what I do more than he will follow what I say. Third, my son was born intelligent, as a whole human being, with the ability to express and understand human emotion. I must help fill that brilliance with information and rich experiences that let him see the beauty of the world and understand how to navigate around the ugly. Fourth, my son has rights and responsibilities. He has the right to be loved and to find love. He has the right to fail and to succeed, to never go hungry, to never be homeless and to always have a community and a family. He has the responsibility to nurture others, to fight oppression. Fifth, I have to be the best human being I can be. It is my responsibility to work even when I cannot find work. I must maintain a true and loving partnership with his mother. Through me, he must learn to see all people as created equal, to never disrespect women in any way with verbal, emotional or physical abuse. Right now, my son is sleeping. I look upon him knowing he feels my love. I also know he can feel stress, tension and negative emotions. As a nurturing father, I should always remember that any mistakes he makes are not a reflection of who he is. At the core, he is a good human being whose soul comes from the Creator of the Universe, and my wife and I have been chosen as the primary caretakers for this vessel of light, this small human being. And we will do the best we know how, praying all along that it is enough. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ibrahim Abdul-Matin.","Ibrahim Abdul-Matin looked for advice when he was becoming a dad; now he offers his own .

"(CNN) -- Golf's forgotten man, Colombia's Camilo Villegas, gave the galleries a reminder of his prodigious talent with a six-under-par 64 to lead the Honda Classic Thursday . Villegas won the 2010 edition of the PGA Tour event at Palm Beach Gardens but a shocking run of form since saw him lose his card at the end of the 2012 season. Playing on an invite from the sponsors, the 31-year-old Villegas, carded four birdies and a stunning eagle on the 18th to lead Rickie Fowler, Canada's Graham DeLaet and Branden Grace of South Africa by a stroke. Villegas came home in just 30 for the treacherous back nine of the PGA National Course as he bids for his fourth PGA Tour win and a return to golf's top table. Honda Classic latest leaderboard . His 263-yard three-wood approach to the 18th ""the perfect number for me"" set up his superb finish. ""It was nice to make it,"" he told Sky Sports ""And nice to see the ball going in the hole, I've been working hard for the last few months and nice to see the result,"" he added. It left him six shots clear of defending champion and World No.1 Rory McIlroy, who again battled an errant driver and had to rely on his short game to stay in touch. McIlroy, who missed the cut in his first event of the season since switching to the clubs of his new sponsor Nike, then lost in the first round of the WGC World Championship last week, got into red fingers on the back nine. But more errant play from tee to green saw him finish with a disappointing bogey six for level par 70. It left him on the same mark as early starter Tiger Woods, who recovered from two over at the turn, to recover to level par. Woods had to take off his shoes and socks to play a ball half submerged in the water hazard at the sixth, his 15th, but it paid off. He moved the ball forward and his third left him eight foot from the hole, making the putt for a valuable par. But the former No.1 struggled on the greens and he finished with 32 putts. ""I hit good putts,"" Woods told the official PGA Tour website. ""I was getting fooled on the grain, the green speeds are a little bit faster than they were but it's an adjustment I need to make."" On the European Tour, South African Darren Fichardt continued his blistering early season form, carding eight holes on his way to a seven-under-par 65 and a one-shot lead in the inaugural Tshwane Open. The 37-year-old won the Africa Open in East London two weeks ago and found his form again on the Copperleaf Golf and Country Estate near Pretoria. Fichardt's nearest challenger is Bjorn Akesson of Sweden in the $1.970 million tournament. Meanwhile, Guan Tianlang's bid to make this year's British Open suffered a major setback as the 14-year-old Chinese golf prodigy fell seven shots off the lead after the first round of International Final qualifying Asia Thursday. Guan will be playing at the U.S.Masters after winning the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship last year on the same Amata Spring Country Club in Thailand where the qualifying is taking place. But a one-over 73 left him with much to do to win won of the four spots available for the July 18-21 British Open at Muirfield.","Camilo Villegas sets early pace at Honda Classic in Florida .

Syrian state TV reacted to American news reporting about the directive, saying Obama has decided to ""support terrorists.""

"(CNN) -- Have you always been something of a risk-taker, or have you tried to avoid risks like the plague? Do you get uncomfortable with too much optimism or praise, or are you known for your sunny outlook? The answer to these questions is remarkably simple, but powerful enough to change your life. In a nutshell, there are two ways to look at your goals. Let's start with a goal many of us share: ""doing my job well."" For some of us, doing our jobs well is about the potential for advancement, achievement and rewards. It's about what we might gain if we are successful. If you are someone who sees your goals this way, you have what's called a promotion focus. For the rest of us, doing our jobs well is about security -- about not losing everything we've worked so hard for. When you are prevention focused, you want to avoid danger, fulfill your responsibilities, and be someone people can count on. You want to keep things running smoothly. Read more: 8 things future leaders must know . What's important to know is that promotion and prevention-focused people work very differently to reach the same goal. They use different strategies, have different strengths, and are prone to different kinds of mistakes. One group will be motivated by applause, the other by criticism. One group may give up too soon -- the other may not know when to quit. The key to reaching your goals -- at work and everywhere else -- is to identify your focus, and learn to work with it instead of against it. There are online assessments you can take to identify your motivational focus, but you can also get a pretty good sense of it by comparing your own behavior to the following descriptions. Promotion people are creative and innovative, comfortable taking chances, optimistic, speedy workers and good at seizing opportunities. The downside is they are also more likely to make mistakes, less likely to have a back-up plan if things go wrong, bad with details, and more likely to take a risk that lands them in hot water. Read more: Ancient personality test goes mainstream . Prevention people are great planners, deliberate, thorough, cautious, skeptical, accurate workers, analytical and good at evaluating. The downside is they are also more likely to miss out on great opportunities, get too bogged down with details, and have a tendency to be overly anxious. Studies show that the way to be most effective in reaching your goals is to use the strategies that match your particular motivation. Attitude . For example when you are promotion-focused, your motivation feels like eagerness. So embrace your optimism as confidence heightens your energy and intensity. Doubting yourself takes the wind right out of your sails. When you are prevention-focused, your motivation feels like vigilance -- you are on the lookout for danger. Vigilance actually increases in response to negative feedback or self-doubt. There's nothing like the looming possibility of failure to get your prevention juices flowing. Overconfidence or effusive praise, however, may lead you to let down your guard, and undermine your motivation -- so beware of both. Decision-making . Promotion-focused people make the best decisions when they weigh the relative pros of option A and B, when they think about why something is worth doing, and when they trust their instincts. The prevention-minded, on the other hand, prefer to weigh the cons of options A and B, and go with lesser of two evils. They make the best decisions when they think about how something could be done, and when they can point to rational reasons, rather than feelings, to justify their choices. Problem-solving . Promotion people are also more exploratory and abstract in their thinking. So generate lots of options and possibilities when coming up with ways to reach your goals -- be creative, consider alternatives. Prevention-focused thinking is concrete and specific -- so pick a plan and stick to it. Prevention people want to drill down to the details, and focus on the nitty-gritty of what needs to be done. They are more comfortable with tried-and-true methods rather than ""innovative"" but untested ones. People always want to know if is it better to be promotion or prevention focused. The truth is, both kinds of motivation can bring you success, and both have their pitfalls. Each brings something of value (e.g., bold solutions, attention to detail) to your organization. Or your personal life. My promotion-focused husband dreams up all of our terrific family vacations, while I take care of the more prevention-focused tasks, like making sure we all have passports. So you can be happy and successful at work and in life by focusing on what there is to gain or what there is to lose. Just remember to play to your strengths and to take with a grain of salt the well-meaning advice and input from others when it doesn't feel right for you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Heidi Grant Halvorson .","Two types of attitude to work, says Heidi Grant Halvorson, promotion and prevention focused .
Knowing your motivation and working with it, not against, is key, she says .
Both types can have successful careers and fulfilling personal lives ."
"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- A top Bolivian official has a stern warning for those who criticize President Evo Morales on social networks: He's watching what they say, and taking names. ""I am always going online, and I am writing down the first and last names of the people who insult him on Facebook and Twitter,"" Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera said in remarks widely reported in Bolivian media this week. The vice president's comments have drawn sharp criticism from some free speech advocates. But lawmakers from Morales' Movement for Socialism party say they hope to push a proposed law regulating social media through the country's Congress. More on free speech: Philippines top court restrains cyberlaw . Constructive criticism is fine, said Franklin Garvizu, a congressman from the president's party. But officials have seen something more nefarious, he said. ""We are very worried because this is a case of systematically using communications mechanisms to plant hatred against the government, to harm the image of our president,"" Garvizu said. Bolivian opposition leaders have a different take. They say such comments show the government's authoritarian aim to censor social networks. ""Obviously on social networks one cannot expect everyone to be praised. The opposition also receives insults from public officials, criticisms with no meaning, attacks, and it would never occur to us to block social networks,"" said Samuel Doria Medina, who heads the opposition National Unity party. ""That's why we've recommended to the vice president that he gets an account, that he interacts (with people). He will learn a lot more about young people, and surely not everyone will applaud him, but some will agree with him."" More on free speech: Press freedoms watchdog slams Turkish government . Word that the government is monitoring information on digital news websites and social networks, and weighing regulating them, sparked sharp criticism among some on the streets of the capital city of La Paz. ""It goes against all the rights, human rights, above all,"" said Maica Guzman. ""Where is freedom of expression?"" Others, like Cristina Perez, noted that the tone of discourse had gotten out of hand. ""No insult is good in any media,"" she said. ""I think people should respect each other, but also these people should respect us."" Of Bolivia's roughly 10 million residents, there are more than 8.7 million cell phone users iwith the ability to access Facebook and Twitter or download YouTube videos, said Eduardo Rojas, president of Bolivia's Redes Foundation. There are about 1.7 million Facebook users nationwide, he said. That means government officials, he said, should see social media as an opportunity government can join, rather than a threat. Online, he said, ""you can defend, promote and spread human rights, and on the other hand complaints."" ""It is a device that can be used to deepen democracy,"" he said.","Bolivia's vice president says he tracks who insults President Evo Morales online .

"LIMA, Peru (CNN) -- The government of Peru on Friday declared a state of emergency in a remote northern area after a clash between police and indigenous people protesting what they say is the exploitation of their native lands left a number of people dead. Alberto Pizango, a leader of the protesters, says his followers did not kill police officers. Police and indigenous protesters said separately that at least eight police and 22 protesters died. The clash took place at dawn outside the northern province of Bagua in the Department of Amazonas as police attempted to break up a roadblock on the 59th day of protests. Foreign Minister Jose A. Garcia Belaunde told CNN en Español that the state of emergency was ordered to give the government the opportunity to re-establish order and reopen talks with the protesters. Under the state of emergency, the army can be called on to maintain order. ""Look, the use of force is legitimate,"" he said. ""Today, what we have received in response were gunshots -- directed at police helicopters, killing eight or nine police."" But Alberto Pizango, the principal leader of the indigenous group, said his followers could not have been responsible for killing any police, because they were armed only with stones and arrows. He said the demonstrators had been pursuing a peaceful protest. Authorities have not confirmed the number of civilian deaths. The director general of the police, Jose Sanchez Farfan, said government buildings in Bagua had been looted and set aflame. Though a congressional commission has recommended the repeal of the laws rejected by the native communities, President Alan Garcia supports those that allow using the lands, maintaining that the richness of the Amazon belongs to all Peruvians and that a significant percentage of natural areas are already protected. ""These people don't have crowns,"" he said about the protesters. ""These people aren't first-class citizens who can say -- 400,000 natives to 28 million Peruvians -- 'You don't have the right to be here.' No way. That is a huge error."" Garcia called Pizango a criminal. Several days ago, Garcia announced an arrest warrant had been issued for Pizango, who is accused of inciting his followers to violence. Journalist Maria Elena Belaunde contributed to this story from Lima.","Violence flares as police attempt to break up a roadblock .

"(CNN) -- The recent focus may have been on his new relationship with world champion skier Lindsey Vonn but Thursday saw the start of Tiger Woods' quest to reclaim golf's world No. 1 ranking. The 14-time major champion, who revealed he and Vonn released pictures of themselves through social media to thwart photographers he referred to as the ""stakerazzi"", showed all his battling qualities on day one of the Arnold Palmer Invitational. Woods carded an opening round of three-under-par at the Bay Hill course in Florida, to sit in the chasing pack behind leader Justin Rose, who shot 65 to finish on seven-under. The Englishman fired six birdies and an eagle in his round and though Woods' performance was more solid than spectacular he scrambled well to remain within striking distance. Rose's nearest challenger was American John Huh, who sits on five-under while compatriot John Rollins and Canada's Brad Fritsch are a shot further back. ""I certainly didn't play my best, but I got around and made a few good saves out there,"" 37-year-old Woods told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I got a lot out of this round, and I threw away a few shots as well. ""I didn't drive it well, didn't hit my irons well and didn't control my distances or trajectory well."" Starting his round on the ninth, Woods recorded back-to-back bogeys before making crucial par saves at the first and second. ""Those were key because I had just thrown away a couple of shots I gained on 16,"" Woods said. ""It's just making a key save, a key putt here and there and keeping the round going."" Prior to his opening round Woods spoke publicly for the first time about his romance with Vonn, which the couple confirmed on Monday with statements and photos posted on social networking site Facebook. At a press conference on Wednesday he said they had released news of their relationship to limit paparazzi intrusion. ""It's very simple, we're very happy where we are at but also we wanted to limit the stalkerazzi and all those sleazy websites out there following us,"" he told reporters. ""I've had situations where it's been very dangerous for my kids, the extent that they'll go to. We basically devalued the first photos. ""Unfortunately that's just the way it is in our society right now and we felt it was the best thing to do and we're very happy about it."" Rose's fine round was largely due to his putting prowess. He needed just 25 and converted all 17 chances from 15-feet or under. ""That's been the error of my game since June last year,"" Rose said. ""Today was probably the first real hot day I've had with the blade in a long, long time."" ""We all know it's about consistency and that's what I'm still working toward. It's just fun to know that I obviously can do it, and I take a lot of confidence from that.""","Tiger Woods shoots three-under round in solid start to Arnold Palmer Invitational .

"Augusta, Georgia (CNN) -- Tiger Woods was penalized two strokes Saturday after a rules committee deemed he violated one of golf's ball-drop rules during Friday's play, an official with the Masters Tournament said. ""I didn't know I had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard,"" Woods said in a four-part tweet on Saturday. ""I understand and accept the penalty and respect the Committees' decision."" On Friday, Woods, a four-time tournament champion, hit a shot on the 15th hole that ricocheted off the flagstick and bounced into a pond. Woods took a drop then bogeyed the hole. ""After being prompted by a television viewer, the Rules Committee reviewed a video of the shot (after the drop) while he was playing the 18th hole,"" Fred Ridley, the Augusta National Golf Club's competition committee chairman, said in a written statement. Get full coverage here from The Bleacher Report . At that time the committee determined Woods hadn't broken any rules, but later met with Woods after he described on television where he stood to drop the ball. Woods told reporters he stood ""two yards"" behind the spot of his errant shot before the drop. Television replays suggested he was a little closer. ""So I went back to where I played it from, but I went two yards further back and I took, tried to take two yards off the shot of what I felt I hit,"" Woods told reporters Friday. The rule gives three options for making a drop, one of which is to do so as ""nearly as possible"" to the site of the original shot. Masters officials spoke with Woods early Saturday morning, Ridley said at a news conference. Woods was ""very forthright"" and ""honest,"" Ridley said, and it was his best judgment that Woods intended to comply with the rules. The officials watched replays of the shots with Woods, Ridley said. The committee didn't disqualify Woods for signing an improper scorecard because it made its ""initial determination prior to the finish of the player's round."" Woods finished Saturday's round at 3-under par, four strokes off the lead. After walking off the course, he told CBS -- which is broadcasting the event -- that he feels the punishment is fair. ""I made a mistake,"" Woods said. ""Under the rules of golf, I made an improper drop."" Full Masters leaderboard . CNN's Rachel Nichols reported from Augusta, and Steve Almasy wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Is Twitter forcing journalists to march in mindless lockstep? On the surface, the notion seems absurd. Media folks may hang out on Twitter as the new cool-kids' club, but isn't the point to broadcast your own brand? Why would anyone in the news racket want to echo what the rest of the gang is saying? Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank conjured up the thesis after seeing hordes of colleagues tweeting away at a presidential debate. It is on all those laptop screens, he says, that ""the conventional wisdom gels -- and subsequent tweets, except those from the most hardened partisans, increasingly reflect the Twitter-forged consensus."" Before explaining why this is utterly wrong -- OK, mostly wrong -- a little background on what has become a powerhouse social media network. Twitter is the new AP, I like to say, a place where journalists often break news, even before feeding it to their employers. This happened to me a couple of weeks back when I learned from a source while driving that Roger Ailes had signed a new four-year deal to run Fox News. I pulled over, tweeted it on my iPad and watched it ricochet across the Web well before I could write an actual story. Watch: Why do reporters stand out in the rain? This is a bit of a problem, as news organizations aren't getting the traffic from these posts. But they are still getting credit, and the truth is we have no choice but to be part of that conversation. With its plethora of links and more than 500 million users, Twitter is a heck of a self-promotional vehicle for those trying (sometimes relentlessly) to publicize their own work. But the site can also be a minefield that claims journalists as collateral damage. Precisely because it's so instantaneous -- type 140 characters and click -- a growing number of media people have been fired, suspended or removed from stories for insensitive messages and jokes. It happened again recently when a New York Times Magazine writer was put on hiatus for a month after insulting a female critic of his interview with an actress by saying the woman wished she could sleep her way to the top. Twitter's clout extends well beyond those who check it every 10 minutes. Since most journalists these days wants to know what's ""trending,"" what's hot on Twitter quickly makes its way onto websites and cable news shows that desperately want a hipness injection. There is something uniquely democratic about this, because millions of ordinary people can ""vote"" a story -- or bit of silliness -- onto the national agenda. That breaks the power of the old media oligopoly. Watch: Are the media helping Romney measure the drapes? Of course, this zeitgeist-shaping can manifest itself in odd ways. When I was at the second presidential debate, I was blissfully unaware that Mitt Romney had stepped in it by uttering the phrase ""binders full of women"" until I noticed it exploding on my Twitter feed. The campaigns have also used Twitter as a weapon, not just by exchanging snarky tweets but by pushing mocking hashtags, or searchable phrases -- sometimes through ""promoted tweets,"" as Obama's side did with the ""binders"" comment. That brings me back to Milbank's argument that Twitter prods the journalistic lemmings in the same direction. They ""want to make sure that their opinions are not veering from other opinions,"" he told me. Otherwise, ""it'll look like you don't know what you're talking about if you defy the conventional wisdom."" Watch: Female debate moderators slam-dunk the guys . It's worth noting that Newsweek started its Conventional Wisdom Watch back in 1988, well before we were all using the interwebs. And I'm sure a few journalists rely on Twitter as a digital weathervane to make sure they're pointing in the right direction. But I view Twitter as a cauldron of ideas -- some brilliant, some witty, some wacky. I see lots of people take issue with each other (or with me), sometimes less than politely. Since I make a point of following people on the left and right, I get revealing glimpses into what's cooking across the spectrum. In this kind of crowded marketplace, most media people and civilians try to stand out with smart and edgy insights, rather than just repackage what everyone else is dishing. I guess it all comes down to who you follow and whether you escape the hall of mirrors by occasionally shutting the thing off. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz says it's wrong to say Twitter pressures journalists into a consensus .

"London, England (CNN) -- It's a windy and misty Sunday afternoon in March in the beautiful coastal town of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, and bleary-eyed travelers are disembarking from a coach after a two-hour journey from London. But these are no ordinary tourists. Among them are some of the most influential names in British media and politics, and about 150 of them have descended on this sleepy town, best known for being the home of the late composer Benjamin Britten, to attend the Names not Numbers ideas festival. Over the next few days, the attendees of this conference, which has been described as ""intellectual viagra,"" will indulge in heavy, and sometimes provocative, discourse around themes such as creativity, history and even neuroscience. From the hugely influential juggernaut that is the TED conference to the invite-only Google Zeitgeist to South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, there has been an undeniable boom in the ideas movement, bringing together creative luminaries and thinkers to flex some serious brain muscle. In his book ""Where good ideas come from,"" Steven Johnson attempts to explain the phenomenon of inspiration and argues that peer-produced innovations is key in the process of developing ideas, by bringing together doers and a network of thinkers to create new things in a collaborative process. At Names not Numbers, an event sponsored by CNN International, the combination of limiting delegate numbers and bringing together an eclectic mix of speakers to hold 19th century-style salons in a remote location is intended to create a more communal experience than a conventional conference, says founder Julia Hobsbawm. Read more: The woman using social media to predict the future . Founded in 2009, Hobsbawm, the daughter of Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm, describes the event as an ""experiential residential"" that connects people from ""different walks of life -- business, culture, media, politics, academia, with each other in a very intensive setting."" ""The day conference is not conducive to fostering really brilliant ideas, so Names Not Numbers has always had the travel and shared cottage accommodation at its heart, as well as excellent content in the sessions themselves,"" she adds. Previous speakers have included the UK's prime minister David Cameron, philosopher Alain de Botton and the pop star Annie Lennox. This year, Dominic Young, a tech entrepreneur described it as an ""amazing, legendary event,"" from which he was ""only just coming back to Earth."" These events are seen as a real force for innovation and harness the power of bringing individuals across disciplines together to hopefully create serendipitous collaborations. ""Ideas conferences are a great source of inspiration, thoughts and, well, ideas,"" says Peter Bale, vice president and general manager of Digital for CNN International. ""CNN International was ready to support Names Not Numbers because it's an innovative format for generating conversation around some of the most important world issues: neuroscience, internet privacy, inequality and adding literature, arts and music to the mix."" Gatherings that promote big ideas have never been more valuable or lucrative. Popularized in the 1970s, they have increased significantly in number but perhaps the best known of the genre is the TED conference, which is held twice a year and has spawned a series of offshoots. Among them was the TEDActive conference in Palm Springs, . Ostensibly, TEDActive revolves around simulcasts of the three-day TED talks in Long Beach. However, it has evolved far from this back-seat role to carve it's own identity and attracts a fiercely loyal crowd that keeps coming back for more. Elizabeth Barry is a marketing executive from New Jersey who has attended Active for the past two years. She describes it as an ""adult camp for intellectual stimulation."" For some these events represent a move away from the traditional conference model, highly prized by some employers for business education and professional development. But others like Harvard economist Umair Haque argue that the great ideas industry needs ""saving from itself."" In his blog, he says: ""The ideas industry ... oft seems hell-bent on turning each and every human on planet Earth into either a breathless 'pundit' or a zombified 'consumer.'""","From TED conferences to South by Southwest, ideas festivals are booming .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Prince Harry arrived in Afghanistan on Friday on a four-month military deployment in his role as an Apache helicopter pilot, Britain's Ministry of Defense said. Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and third in line to the British throne, is a captain in Britain's Army Air Corps. He will be stationed at dusty Camp Bastion in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province -- considered a Taliban heartland -- with the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment Army Air Corps. Opinion: Cheeky Prince Harry vs dull brother Wills . The austere conditions will be a far cry from the more luxurious lifestyle he enjoys when on leave in the United Kingdom -- or on his widely covered trip to Las Vegas last month, where a scandal broke after he was photographed naked while partying in his hotel room on what turns out to have been a predeployment vacation. Prince Harry served briefly in Afghanistan four years ago, but he was hurriedly withdrawn amid safety fears when news of his deployment to a small forward operating base leaked. The media are allowed to report on his deployment this time, although the timing of his arrival in Afghanistan was kept under wraps. ""He's approached the deployment with a range of emotions like any other soldier and feels both pride and anticipation as he deploys for a job he's trained for, for so long,"" a St. James's Palace spokesman said. ""Prince Harry, like any soldier, considers it a great honor to represent his country in Her Majesty's armed forces wherever it chooses to deploy him."" Prince Harry leaves scandal behind at UK awards dinner . A palace source said the prince, who turns 28 this month, will be treated just the same as his fellow soldiers. The queen and Prince Charles have been fully briefed on his deployment, the source said, adding that Charles was immensely proud of his son. Harry qualified to fly an Apache helicopter in combat early this year, after doing some of his training over the deserts of Arizona and Nevada. He won an award as the best co-pilot gunner in his peer group during training. The Camp Bastion complex, near the large U.S. Camp Leatherneck, is one of the busiest airfields in the world, with more than 28,000 people working on site, according to the UK Ministry of Defense. While stationed there, Prince Harry will be part of the Joint Aviation Group, which provides support to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and Afghan forces in the region. Capt. Jock Gordon, commander of the Joint Aviation Group, welcomed Prince Harry to Camp Bastion -- and appealed for him to be allowed to get on with his job. ""Working together with his colleagues in the squadron, he will be in a difficult and demanding job, and I ask that he be left to get on with his duties and allowed to focus on delivering support to the coalition troops on the ground,"" he said, in remarks quoted by the Press Association news agency. The Ministry of Defense said Harry's squadron would ""provide surveillance, deterrence and, when required, close combat attack capabilities as well as escort duties for other aircraft."" How Harry tore up royal rule book . Since Harry qualified in February he has been gaining additional flying experience with 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, the statement said. ""He has been trained to fly in the front seat as the mission commander, a role that equips the operative to fly the aircraft from the back seat but the majority of the time involves operating the Apache's sights, sensors and weapons systems,"" it said. Harry was withdrawn only 10 weeks into his last deployment to Afghanistan, amid concern that knowledge of his presence there could expose him and his fellow troops to greater risk. This time, he is based in a more secure military complex, and Apache helicopters are a target for Taliban attacks regardless of whether Prince Harry is piloting them or not. His deployment is expected to be a big morale boost for British forces in Afghanistan and may go some way to restoring his public image following last month's scandal. The prince hit the headlines after he was photographed naked while in his swanky Las Vegas hotel suite with friends and a group of women they had met. The images were widely published on the Internet and by Britain's best-selling tabloid newspaper The Sun, prompting questions about media invasion of privacy. Other UK media outlets respected a request by St. James's Palace not to publish the images, one of which showed Harry using his hands to shield his modesty, while another showed his bare bottom. Nude Harry photos: How UK tabloids lost their sting . The Press Complaints Commission, the UK newspaper watchdog, said Thursday it had received about 3,800 complaints from the public about the decision by The Sun to publish the images -- but none from palace officials. ""The Commission is in continuing dialogue with Prince Harry's representatives but as yet has not received a formal complaint,"" the commission said in a statement. While the body appreciates the concerns raised by members of the public, an investigation without the consent and involvement of royal officials would be ""inappropriate,"" the statement said. Before the drama over the photographs, Prince Harry had won praise from the UK media in recent months for embracing a more central public role in support of the queen in her diamond jubilee year. This included representing his grandmother at the Olympics Closing Ceremony and on a royal tour to the Caribbean. CNN's Anna Coren contributed from Kabul; Max Foster and Laura Smith-Spark reported from London.","NEW: Harry will be treated like any other soldier and is proud to serve, palace spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Residents of coastal areas in Bangladesh and Myanmar are preparing for the arrival of a large storm that is rumbling toward them across the Bay of Bengal, with a U.N. agency warning that more than 8 million people could be in danger. The storm, Tropical Cyclone Mahasen, is forecast to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday in southeastern Bangladesh, near the city of Chittagong. It is likely to bring strong wind and heavy rain to the surrounding region. On Myanmar's western coast, there are concerns about the safety of tens of thousands of Muslims who are living in makeshift camps in low-lying areas after their homes were destroyed in sectarian violence last year. ""Mahasen could be life threatening for millions of people in Bangladesh, Myanmar and India,"" Valerie Amos, the U.N.'s top official for humanitarian affairs, said in a statement Tuesday. The number of people the storm will affect depends on the exact path it plows across the region and its strength when it reaches land. Aid agencies and local authorities are scrambling to make sure residents are as prepared as possible, taking measures that include moving people at risk to higher ground and putting emergency supplies in position. ""There is a flurry of activity going on both in Bangladesh and in Myanmar ahead of the storm,"" Andreas Von Weissenberg of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent said Wednesday. ""It's really a race against time in many ways."" The latest prediction suggests Mahasen will bring wind gusts of 85 to 90 kilometers per hour (53 to 56 mph) to the Bangladeshi coast, CNN International meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said. That puts it at the level of a tropical storm, he said, weaker than the 120-kilometer-per-hour gusts of a hurricane. ""This will be a rain event for most in the area,"" Cabrera said. ""If you are in a concrete building, you will be fine outside of localized very heavy flooding."" The floods could cause problems in low-lying areas, particularly the flimsy camps in Myanmar's Rakhine state. As the storm approaches, Myanmar authorities and relief agencies have begun working to relocate tens of thousands of the camps' inhabitants. Most of them are Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority who suffered during decades of military rule in Myanmar. Sectarian violence erupted in Rakhine last year between Buddhists and Muslims, resulting in the deaths of scores of people, the majority of them Rohingya. Since then, more than 100,000 Muslims have been forced to live in camps. In a report last month, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch accused Myanmar authorities of involvement in a Buddhist campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" against the Rohingya in Rakhine. The Myanmar government dismissed the report as ""one-sided."" The efforts to relocate some of the displaced Rohingya living in the camps appear to have been hindered by distrust of the security forces involved. Some of those in the camps ""are reluctant to relocate, and some communities have refused to use military vehicles or to shelter in military barracks,"" the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update on the situation Tuesday. Alternative relocation sites are being sought, it said. On Monday night, a boat ferrying people from one camp in Rakhine to safer areas hit rocks and capsized, the OCHA said, citing the government. Fifty-eight people are believed to still be missing from the accident. Some survived, and an unspecified number died, the agency said. Bangladesh authorities appear to be well organized for the storm's possible threat to the low-lying and densely populated nation. As many as 50,000 volunteers are giving out early warnings, providing advice, helping people relocate and preparing to give first aid and distribute relief items, Von Weissenberg said. Bangladesh has learned to take a cautious approach to storms after the catastrophic impact of Cyclone Bhola in 1970 that is estimated to have killed 400,000 people, according to the OCHA. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report from Hong Kong and Saeed Ahmed from Dhaka, Bangladesh.","Tropical Cyclone Mahasen is moving toward the Bangladesh coast .

"(CNN) -- The media have been giving us binders full of blather. In a campaign that is supposedly, allegedly and ostensibly about big and serious issues, we have been wallowing in what amounts to sideshow stuff. It's not just the focus on Mitt Romney saying at last week's presidential debate that in looking for appointees in Massachusetts he received ""binders full of women,"" an admittedly funny phrase that exploded on cable news. The trending Twitter topic after this week's face off was President Obama's line about Romney hearkening back to a military backed by ""horses and bayonets."" Journalists after the first debate flocked to that towering issue known as Big Bird. Are the media trivializing the campaign? We have, through the course of this endless campaign season, bounced from one ephemeral controversy to the next, from the dog on the roof to ""oops!"" from Etch A Sketch to Joe Biden's laughter. Journalists have pounced on botched phrases deemed to be gaffes: . ""I like being able to fire people;"" ""You didn't build that;"" ""Ann Romney never worked a day in her life;"" ""I'm not concerned about the very poor."" Sometimes there are legitimate questions embedded in the choice of language, as with Romney's apparent dismissal of 47% of America, but more often it's just a chance to turn the candidate into a piÃ±ata. 'Binders full of women' overshadows Presidential debate . Campaigns have always had their lighter side, of course, but this year we seem to be getting more empty calories than ever. That is not to slight the dogged reporters who have in fact delved into the issues and done the arduous work of fact-checking the candidates' ads and utterances. But let's face it: How often has their work been on the front pages or at the top of the newscasts? Sure, in an age of on-demand information, you can gorge yourself on the candidates' conflicting arguments on the auto bailout or trade with China. But the media create narratives by cranking up the volume, and you have to strain to hear the issues dissected in a way you didn't when Donald Trump was throwing around his birtherism nonsense. Yes, the substantive pieces have run on inside newspaper pages, occasionally on home pages, and popped up on television, which has a harder time coping with complexity. So much easier for all of us to trumpet the latest poll. More dual-screen users Tweeting during debates . In their debates, the candidates have clashed on tax cuts, health care, immigration, Libya and other vital questions. You might wonder: Is Romney suddenly moderating positions he has taken for the last two years? Why, on Monday night in Boca Raton, did he keep agreeing with Obama's foreign policy? Does the president have a real second-term agenda? Yet the post-game chatter has zeroed in on zingers, body language, interruptions and attacks on the moderators themselves. The foreign policy debate was sober and high-minded; does anyone actually believe the media will be exploring the exchanges on Afghanistan and Syria for more than 24 hours? Some of this sustained superficiality has to do with today's relentless news cycle and shrinking attention spans. ""You can't talk in 140 characters on Twitter about the complexities of the budget or taxes,"" veteran journalist Steve Roberts told me on Reliable Sources. Maybe so, but does that mean we just punt? Obama, Jon Stewart and 2012's comedy factor . The burden falls on the candidates as well. If they speak in vague sound bites and duck hard choices, it's more difficult (but hardly impossible) for news organizations to put substantive questions front and center. What's more, they are increasingly ignoring the media's attempts to call them on exaggerations and falsehoods. ""We're not going (to) let our campaign be dictated by fact-checkers,"" Romney pollster Neil Newhouse said at the GOP convention. Once upon a time, campaigns felt compelled to make adjustments when their distortions were spotlighted. These days they just double the ad buy. Have you noticed how many times the media have declared that we are about to plunge into a dead-serious debate? First the campaign was going to be about the economy. When the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare, we were assured that health care would be a dominant issue. When Romney picked Paul Ryan, the pundits agreed that this would be a big election about Medicare and budget-cutting. Instead we wound up with endless stories about Ryan's P90X workout. Hey, I get it. Everyone's chasing clicks and eyeballs. Delving into the intricacies of how Obama and Romney would fix Medicare can be eye-glazing, while writing about Michelle and Ann on ""The View"" is fun. But as the clock runs out on the 2012 race, I'm left with this nagging feeling: Don't we deserve a better campaign? And aren't the media partially responsible? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: We've seen media seize on a parade of trivial statements in campaign .

"(CNN) -- Edwin Moses would like it to be known that Olympic athletes are made -- painstakingly -- not born. In a remarkable career as a 400 meters hurdler, Moses won gold at the 1976 and 1984 Olympics, broke four world records and enjoyed one of sport's greatest winning streaks -- going unbeaten for an incredible 122 races. Known as ""Kermit"" in high school for his long, frog-like limbs, Moses started hurdling when he was substituted in for a relay race. ""Someone got hurt and the coach said 'who wants to try hurdles?'"" he recalls. ""I just got up there and started doing it. Never had anyone teach me, I just learned by doing it."" Following his track career, Moses formulated an assistance program that allowed athletes to accept funding from stipends and endorsements without losing their eligibility to compete at the Olympics. Today, Moses is a father, chair of the Laureus World Sports Academy, which promotes social change through sport, and a financial consultant for an investment management bank. He is also a motivational speaker who aims to inspire success in a corporate environment. Here, he tells Route to the Top about some of the principles that have underpinned his success, and that can apply to your own career, whether you're chasing Olympic gold, or just a promotion. First learn, then innovate ... ""I won my first gold medal in '76. I was 20 years old, which is young by today's standards. I was right in the middle of my third year of college, studying physics and engineering, so I had a very good grounding in the mechanics of running. ""At Morehouse College we had no track, no field, no physical therapist, no massage therapist, nothing. So I basically had to put together an intense training program. ""I was very innovative, because I didn't have a lot of resources.

"San Diego (CNN) -- In my CNN.com column last week, I wrote that the first thing a candidate running for office needs to know about Latino voters is that they value nothing more than respect. Here's the second thing: It's not respectful to lump together Latino U.S. citizens with Latino illegal immigrants. Not all Latinos in the United States arrived here five minutes ago. In fact, some of us come from families who have been here for five generations. And there are those in the state of New Mexico who can trace their roots in the Southwest back several hundred years. This message is not getting through. Just look at the comments posted at CNN.com in response to my column, which was about Latino citizens who can vote. Many readers thought that I was demanding respect for illegal immigrants who can't vote: . ""How about the illegals start respecting our laws first off? Then we'll talk."" -- ThirdeyeWO . ""I will respect them once they stop stealing money and jobs from the US citizen...Anotherwords (sic) they need to go back to Mexico...Leave Now and you may get a little respect, until then you are the enemey (sic) of the american (sic) worker and taxpayer!!!!!"" -- GopUSA . ""I have zero respect for the arrogant, self centered, disrespectful display of illegal foreigners marching and yelling - in SPANISH - in the streets of MY COUNTRY demanding MY RIGHTS that they have not earned and are not entitled to!"" - For . ""Want respect? Earn it by obeying the laws of our country, even the immigration laws!"" -- Robbery . In my e-mail in-box, there was more of the same: . ""Respect is something one EARNS. The Latino voter needs to RESPECT this country and not use it as an ATM to send money to their families in Mexico. Latino voters need to speak and understand the ENGLISH language because that is how business is transacted. Latino voters need to respect the rules and laws in this country and not demand bilingual education and ballots and drivers manuals in Spanish..."" - Pat P. ""Are you saying that because Latinos contribute to the economy, deserve respect and are family-centric, everything else doesn't matter, even if they are here illegally?...This is the issue I see coming up with some who advocate for illegal immigrants: a lack of respect for our country's laws...."" -- Bill C. ""In response to your recent CNN articles, I am 100% against everything you stand for...I don't respect illegals, and I certainly want our president, weak as he may be, to continue to deport each and every illegal and every child of every illegal. Drivers licenses and tuition for illegals?!...You're in MY country. Adapt. If you want respect, adapt to OUR ways..."" - Lawrence F. I'm always amazed when I see comments like these. People are pretty worked up over the growth of the Latino community and the role that immigration played in fueling it. Many of them can talk your ear off about that. And yet, not many of them seem to know any flesh-and-blood Latinos. If they did, they would know how ridiculous it is to treat U.S. citizens and illegal immigrants as if they are one and the same. Besides, they seem to put a lot of stock in what it means to be an American. So shouldn't they be able to recognize Americans when they see them? There is some good news, though. Some readers figured out the difference between U.S Latino citizens and illegal immigrants and tried to explain it to others: . ""Just for the record, not every Latino in America is illegal. Please stop combining us with the minority that came here illegally. I'm sick of being told off for 'being illegal' just because I'm Hispanic. My family has been here since the 1600s thank you very much. Longer than most people's families that tell me to 'go back to Mexico.' Ironic isn't it?"" - Iblink . Ah, yes. Go back to Mexico. In the 20 years that I've written about immigration, I've been told that hundreds of times. I don't suppose it has anything to do with being Mexican-American? Apparently, I'm not the only one hearing it. Someone has even taken the experience and put it to music. The result is a profound and provocative song called ""Somos Mas Americanos"" from one of my favorite Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte. It goes like this: . ""They have shouted at me a thousand times that I should go back to my country...Because there's no room for me here... I want to remind the gringos: I didn't cross the border, the border crossed me... And they can call me ""invader."" That's a very frequent mistake... If we take into account centuries...even if it bothers our neighbors ...We are more American.. Than all of the gringos..."" Noting that ""America"" is actually made up of three continents and not just one, the lyrics declare that -- in reality -- Mexicans have been ""Americans"" longer than the descendants of European immigrants. In that sense, Mexican immigrants to the United States are more American than the folks trying to keep them out. So there. If that sounds harsh, then so be it. A song like this is born of anger, frustration and righteous indignation. Imagine being treated like a second-class citizen on your own home turf. It does get tiresome. I was born in the United States. The same goes for my parents, three grandparents, and half of my great-grandparents. And I'm supposed to ""go back to Mexico""? What? You mean on vacation? Great idea. Puerto Vallarta is lovely this time of year.

"Myanmar (CNN) -- When Nyein Chan Aung sold his house in Yangon recently he faced a dilemma -- what do to with the proceeds. Did he he take his cash to the bank or keep it at home? He compromised. A third went to the bank, the rest stayed where he lives. In fact, the only reason he deposited anything at all was fear of a house fire. Read more: Looking for transformation in Myanmar . This is banking in Myanmar, circa 2013. An outdated and debased system, open for decades to abuse by the previous regime, and shunned by about 90% of the population. People here completely bypass the banks and keep their money at home. It's the closest thing you'll find to a total cash economy anywhere in the world. Read more: Change in Myanmar, the market view . The Myanmar government has made fixing the banking system a priority but a quick visit to any branch reveals the size of the problem they face. It's an extraordinary scene: Teller counters and the office tables are literally overflowing with cash. Bricks of the stuff, tied in bundles of a thousand notes balancing precariously on top of each other or littering the floor in large untidy piles. And customers bring in more in bulging shopping bags, while security guards wheel in white rice bags with still more bundles of kyat, as the local currency is known. Myanmar is still working on a real credit system and ATM machines are a relatively new development -- if they work. Like most businesses in the city and the towns, frequent blackouts means the systems shut down. I tried three ATMs over the course of a day. None worked. Read more: 11 things to know before visiting Myanmar . But it goes much deeper than that. The banking system we take for granted in most countries -- easy loans, financial products, interbank operations, credit -- they're all virtually non existent here. There is no proper corporate banking. Businesses cannot get loan repayment plans of longer than one year. True, they are rolled over but it means the central plank for corporate borrowing -- a realistic repayment schedule -- doesn't exist. Bank managers still have to telephone the central bank at the end of each trading day to tell them what the balance in the books is. There is now a banking law before parliament and until that is approved, thorough root-and-branch reform cannot take place. And even when it does, the banks have to overcome enormous mistrust in the system, built up over two generations of mis-management. People here highly suspicious of banks. One clear sign of change is that credit cards are becoming more common, but only by Visa and Mastercard. No local issuer yet. Visa plans to issue pre-paid credit cards by the end of this year. It's a small step, but for Myanmar a small step in the right direction is critical as it gets ready to be part of a global integrated financial system.","People here completely bypass the banks and keep their money at home .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- For the last 15 years, Victoria Vigo has been trying to find the truth about her infertility. After her third child was born dead, the 49-year-old leadership skills instructor who lives in Lima, the Peruvian capital, was never able to conceive again. Three months after losing her child, a doctor confirmed her worst fears: her tubes had been tied without her knowledge or consent. ""I felt mutilated. That's the truth. My rights as a mother and woman were violated,"" Vigo said. Vigo is not the only woman in Peru who was sterilized in the nineties during the government of President Alberto Fujimori. Human rights organizations say there are more than 2,000 documented cases of women who had their tubes tied without their consent. Nobody really knows how many women were forcibly sterilized throughout Peru, but Victor Cubas, the special prosecutor who reopened the investigation in October, says that the number is in the thousands. ""The Peruvian attorney general's office has knowledge of about 2,000 women (in this situation), but cases of forced sterilization based on the number of people (who participated in the campaign) could undoubtedly be larger at the national level. There are many women who I'm sure haven't reported this and therefore their cases are not yet documented,"" Cubas said. All inquiries about the sterilizations were shelved in 2009 and it was not until late October when Cubas was tapped to reopen the investigation by the new government of President Ollanta Humala. Rossy Salazar, a human rights attorney at Demus, a women's rights organization in Peru, also says there could be many more cases. ""What happened was that [the government] instituted a policy of quotas, in a way forcing and giving incentives to doctors, gynecologists and nurses to sterilize a minimum of three women every month,"" Salazar says. Both government officials and human rights organizations agree that about 300,000 women throughout Peru participated in a birth control campaign during the nineties. The campaign involved several methods including what Peruvian officials call ""voluntary contraceptive surgery"" or tying of the Fallopian Tubes. But Salazar says that this particular method was used in women in rural Peru, especially those who spoke no Spanish, without their knowledge and sometimes by force. In a documentary made by the Latin American and Caribbean Committee for the Defense of Women Rights several women testify that they were sterilized by force or coerced. In her native Quechua tongue, an unidentified woman says she was taken by force to a clinic where she was sterilized in spite of her objections. Another woman says she and her husband were coerced to sign a consent form for sterilization. Marino Costa Bauer was the Peruvian health minister between 1996 and 1998. He denied any wrongdoing when he testified before the Peruvian Congress in the late nineties. And he denied it again, in a recent interview at his Lima office. But Costa Bauer admits the campaign could've been have been executed better. ""Of course there were problems,"" Costa Bauer said. ""I'm not going to deny it. I have never denied that there were problems. But what did we do about it? First, we investigated all of the accusations that were filed; absolutely all of them without exception."" Costa Bauer categorically denies that the government was targeting poor, indigenous women in rural communities. ""There was never any order or instruction from my office favoring one method over another; much less did we ever provide incentives for that to happen,"" the former health minister said. So far Victoria Vigo is the only woman in Peru that has won a case of forced sterilization. After a seven-year trial, she was compensated $2,750, but her doctor didn't serve time in prison. She's now trying to prove that her doctor was acting on government orders and that it was all part of a campaign to deceive women, especially the most vulnerable. ""As a woman, I feel indignant and that's why 15 years ago I said no woman should remain silent when her body has been violated,"" Vigo said. It has been more than a decade since those believed to be responsible for the forced sterilizations left office. For women like Victoria Vigo, the reopening of the probe is the first hope in years that justice may be within reach.","Nobody really knows how many women were forcibly sterilized throughout Peru .

"(CNN) -- Executive jets are a glamorous concept; throw in comfort, performance and robust design and it becomes a business with sex appeal, according to the boss of a Brazilian aerospace giant. Frederico Curado, head of Embraer, told CNN the company had combined ""the best of both worlds"" to create a very ""sex appealing"" line in executive jets. Embraer's push into the market 13 years ago took the competition by surprise, but it became a ""game changer,"" due to its focus on design, comfort and power, Curado said. The company's first model was the Legacy 600 and it now plans to release two more in as many years, with the market stable after the financial crisis exploded five years ago, according to Curado.

""In a certain sense [it is] outgrowing the commercial business."" Embraer, founded over 40 years ago, is also looking to make inroads into the U.S. defense market. In February the U.S. Air Force announced it had selected Embraer Defense for its LAS (Light Air Support) program, a contract for 20 aircraft worth $427 million.

But, following a decline in exports of manufactured goods over the past decade, competitiveness has been eroded by a strong currency. WATCH MORE: Luxurious squatting in Brazil . According to Curado, high-costs and bureaucracy makes it difficult to do business in Brazil, despite its ""tremendous potential."" He added: ""Brazil, unfortunately, is not an obvious destination for high-tech companies to invest in, to build for example a global platform for exports... A lot is driven by the Brazilian domestic market."" Brazil -- the world's sixth largest economy -- is considered one of the emerging market superpowers of the next decade and is part of former Goldman Sachs economist Jim O'Neill's famous 2001 acronym, BRIC, referring to Brazil, Russia, India and China. Despite this billing, the country has struggled with relatively low growth for the last two years, recording only a 0.6% increase in 2012. READ MORE: Brazil unveils shaky answer to the vuvuzela .

The CEO is also hopeful the soccer World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016 will go some way to improving living conditions in Brazil, leading to infrastructure investment in roads, public transport and airports.

"(CNN) -- Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger of the Union Army announced to the assembled crowd at Ashton Villa in Galveston, Texas, ""In accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free."" It was June 19, 1865. Never mind that President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had been written and read more than two years earlier. Juneteenth, named for the June 19 declaration, started as a celebration of emancipation day in Texas and eventually spread to other states. With celebrations dating back to 1866, Juneteenth now commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. ""America cannot understand its own history unless the African-American experience is embraced as a central factor in shaping who we are and what we have become as Americans,"" writes Lonnie G. Bunch, founding director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington. By the numbers: Juneteenth . Set to open in 2015, the museum will be the only national museum devoted exclusively to the documentation of African-American life, art and culture. In honor of Juneteenth, the museum helped CNN.com choose six destinations that will enlighten and educate visitors about a complicated period of American history, the road to emancipation. Cumberland Island National Seashore, Georgia. The National Park Service started ""Lands and Legacies"" tours of this protected area in 2011, taking visitors on a rugged full-day tour via motorized vehicles on a single-track dirt road to sites related to African-American life on Cumberland Island. The former plantation on the island belonged to Robert Stafford, who by the 1850s had some 400 enslaved people tending his land and working in his house. The final tour stop is the settlement at the north end of the island built by freed individuals from the Stafford plantation whose descendants remained on the island through the 1960s. In the region: Ossabaw Island, the first Georgia State Heritage Preserve, has a strong African-American history connection, particularly in the three cabins dating between 1820 and 1840 â€” built from shells, sand, lime and water to house enslaved people. The cabin area is now a historic preservation and archaeological dig site. Rare LIFE photos document segregation in the South . Germantown, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia, a birthplace of American independence, was also a city of slave-holders. The 1780 census reported that 6% of Pennsylvania's population was enslaved and most of them were living and working in Philadelphia. Although laws abolishing slavery were passed in Pennsylvania that year, their enactment was so gradual that some people were not freed for another 40 years. Cliveden, the 18th-century home of the Chew family, immerses visitors in this part of America's past in the Philadelphia area of Germantown. Its unusual two-story slave dwelling has been restored and is open to visitors, as is the main house. Cliveden also holds a large archive of Chew family documents that includes household inventories of property (enslaved individuals are among the ""items"" listed) and even the measurements of enslaved individuals' feet for a local shoemaker hired to make their shoes. In the area: The unassuming colonial Johnson House was owned by an abolitionist Quaker family, who made it a ""station"" on the Underground Railroad in the 1800s. Today it's a stop on the ""Quest for Freedom"" self-guided driving tours developed by the Pennsylvania Tourism Department. Nicodemus, Kansas. In the years immediately following emancipation, Kansas wanted settlers, and newly freed people in Kentucky wanted a home where they could raise their children in peace and safety. It seemed like the perfect match, but when groups from Kentucky relocated to Graham County, Kansas, in the 1870s, they were stunned by what they found there. ""My husband pointed out various smokes coming out of the ground and said, 'That is Nicodemus.' The families lived in dugouts. ...The scenery was not at all inviting, and I began to cry,"" 30-year-old Willina Hickman wrote in 1878. What those newly freed people made of the place is the focus of the Nicodemus National Historic Site. The town, incorporated in 1877 and named for an escaped slave, never had a huge population, but it is the oldest surviving African-American town west of the Mississippi. Park ranger tours take in five historic buildings and cover the well-documented history of the town and its people, including Willina Hickman and her husband, Daniel. St. Helena Island, South Carolina. The heart of Gullah culture, this island near Beaufort, South Carolina, is home to the Penn Center, a school, job training facility and a safe haven for freed people as early as 1862 after the Sea Islands were occupied and liberated by Union troops. The strength, unity and continuity of the community, most of whom trace their heritage directly to west Africa, has long been an inspiration, so much so that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is thought to have drafted his ""I have a dream"" speech while visiting there. Wander through the town of Frogmore, visit studios and shops selling the work of local artists and craftspeople, and sample the lowcountry cooking, derived from traditional African dishes, that has sustained the region for generations. Charleston, South Carolina. ""Charleston looks the way it does because of African-American hands,"" notes Deborah L. Mack, associate director for community and constituent services at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. From the silhouettes of the buildings to the characteristic ornamental ironwork that adorns them, African-Americans, both enslaved and free, literally built the city, and their descendants comprise much of Charleston's population today. ""These are families who have been there for 300 years, and they're grounded in the community,"" Mack says. One neighborhood of interest is Harleston Village, where you'll find 1820s houses built by Richard Holloway and Morris Brown, free black men who owned the homes as investment properties. Look for the ironwork of master blacksmith Philip Simmons, who learned from master blacksmiths in the early 20th century and carried on Charleston's ironwork tradition into the 21st century. Charleston is also an excellent place to explore urban Gullah Geechee culture that grew within the communities of enslaved people from west and central Africa â€” developing and refining its own language and traditions -- and that is very much alive today. Allensworth, California. Westward migration of freed people from the South eventually led to towns such as Allensworth, chartered in 1908 in rural Tulare County. Town founder Col. Allen Allensworth was born enslaved in Kentucky in 1842 and became a military chaplain after the Civil War. What drove him was a desire to nurture self-reliance and security among communities of freed people. The town flourished until the Great Depression, and by the 1970s, only a few residents remained. California designated it a state historic park in 1976, preserving and restoring the buildings, including Allensworth's home, Frank Milner's barbershop, the First Baptist Church and the very first branch of the Tulare County Free Library.","African-Americans, both enslaved and free, built the city of Charleston .

"(CNN) -- It's official. To watch the 2013 European Champions League final -- arguably one of the most prestigious matches in world football -- will be not much more expensive than watching some top-flight English Premier League games. With Europe in the grip of an economic downturn, European governing body UEFA has cut prices by 25% for its cheapest ticket for the May 25 final. The cheapest ticket for the match at London's Wembley Stadium will cost £60 -- roughly $94 -- compared to £75 in 2012., though fans based in the United Kingdom will also have to pay an £8 administration fee. Not cheap by any means, but only £6 more expensive than the price fans of English champions Manchester City had to pay when they watched their team take on London-based Arsenal last month at the Emirates Stadium . Of the 59,000 Wembley seats on sale to the public for the biggest game in European club football, 20% will be sold at the cheapest ""Category 4"" price. The other three ticket categories available to punters increase in price from £140 to £330. The capacity of Wembley Stadium for the match will be 86,000, with each team receiving 25,000 seats and the remaining 9,000 going on sale to fans around the world. According to UEFA's website, the remaining 27,000 tickets will be ""allocated to the local organising committee, national associations, commercial partners and broadcasters, and to serve the corporate hospitality program."" The price of football tickets in the British capital has been a source of contention in recent months. Soccer vs Gridiron . City fans were outraged with the price they were charged to watch their team's match at the Emirates Stadium, especially given Aston Villa supporters will pay just over half that sum -- £35.50 -- when their club heads to north London on February 23 for a Premier League fixture. The price of the 2013 Champios League final is a drastic reduction from 2011, the last time the event was held at Wembley. Then the cheapest tickets cost £150 for the final between Barcelona and Manchester United, with UEFA president Michel Platini forced later to apologize for his organization's pricing strategy. The Champions League final, which was held at Munich's Allianz Arena in 2012, looks a steal compared to ticket prices for last weekend's Super Bowl. Gridiron fanatics who wished to purchase tickets for the New Orleans showdown between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers had to pay between $850 and $1250 for face-value tickets.","UEFA reduces tickets prices for the 2013 European Champions League final .

"Washington (CNN) -- The systems that control U.S. military drones have been infected with a computer virus, a U.S. defense official confirmed to CNN on Monday. Despite the infection of the classified program, the virus has not ""stopped flights worldwide,"" the official said. The official declined to comment on how the systems were infected nor whether the virus has resisted attempts to remove it. The infection was first reported by Noah Shachtman for Wired magazine last week. ""Military officials are more concerned than panicked by this virus. They're just really not sure what's going on. They're not sure if it's a deliberate attack. They're not sure if it's something accidental,"" he said. While drones are flown on missions in war zones such as Iraq and Afghanistan, the actual ""cockpit"" of the unmanned aircraft is on U.S. soil -- the operators work at Nevada's Creech Air Force Base. According to Wired, the virus, which records pilot key strokes, was first detected about two weeks ago. Tech specialists are unsure whether it was installed intentionally, Wired reported. Shachtman said the military has had a hard time wiping out the virus. ""They're tried over and over again to get rid of this thing using some fairly conventional methods, and they haven't worked. And so it seems the only thing to get rid of this virus is to basically wipe the hard drives of these computers entirely and sort of rebuild the computers from scratch,"" he said. But that can be an exhausting process. In 2008, removable hard drives introduced a virus into thousands of Defense Department computers, and to this day the Pentagon is still purging some machines. In the case of the computers that help coordinate the drones, care also has to be taken to back up all the information so it isn't lost during rebuilding. U.S. drone strikes have been responsible for the deaths of dozens of suspected militants. In recent years, the United States has sharply increased its used of unmanned planes to target insurgents in Pakistan's tribal region, a volatile area bordering war-torn Afghanistan. The covert CIA drone program has been deeply unpopular with many Pakistanis, who say the attacks kill civilians and violate their country's sovereignty. In August, a drone attack killed al Qaeda No. 2 Atiya Abdul Rahman in Pakistan. The most recent high-profile drone strike resulted in the death of U.S.-born militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen last month. Unmanned aerial vehicles have become indispensable for military planners who depend on constant combat air patrols. But current and former Pentagon officials admit the technology cuts both ways. At the confirmation hearing for Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Deputy Defense Secretary William Lynn said bluntly, ""In the 21st century, bits and bytes can be as threatening as bullets and bombs."" He said even the National Defense University has been breached, and in a single intrusion this year 24,000 files were taken from a defense company. ""Some of the stolen data is mundane, like the specifications for small parts of tanks, airplanes and submarines. But a great deal of it concerns our most sensitive systems, including avionics, surveillance technologies, satellite communications systems and network security protocols,"" he said. Perhaps most alarming, Lynn admitted that up till now, the U.S. military had been unable to secure its systems. ""Current countermeasures have not stopped this outflow of sensitive information,"" Lynn said. ""We need to do more to guard our digital storehouses of design innovation."" Officials have not yet determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign, or doing actual harm. An investigation is ongoing. Despite the fact the controls are not linked into any outside network, and therefore seemingly impervious to intrusion, the drone systems do have security issues. Shachtman said they still use external hard drives, and when they're attached to top-secret computers they can open them up to infection. He said the true danger of the virus comes not from an ability to ""bring down a drone,"" which is unlikely, but from an erosion of trust. If officials come to think that the information they're receiving from the unmanned vehicles has been compromised, they're much less likely to view it as safe and valuable, he surmised.","The virus has not ""stopped flights worldwide,"" defense official says .

"Cairo (CNN) -- The military sought Monday to persuade Egyptians to end the demonstrations and strikes that culminated last Friday in the resignation of the president, and urged their countrymen to get back to work. Though efforts are on track to ""realize the legitimate demands of the people for a true democratic environment,"" widespread strikes and demonstrations continued Monday in certain state sectors, ""even though normality has been restored,"" the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said in a statement. It cited ""negative consequences"" of continued unrest, including harming national security, adversely affecting the state's ability to get necessary goods to the public, disrupting production and operations, delaying the nation's return to ""day-to-day life,"" adversely affecting the economy and ""creating an atmosphere that gives the opportunity to irresponsible persons to commit illegitimate acts."" Hosni Mubarak's abdication leaves a council of generals, led by Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, in charge of the Arab world's most populous nation. Since Friday, the military has dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution and vowed to remain in charge until elections can be held in six months or so. In addition, it has declared a curfew from midnight until 6 a.m. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said it would appoint a committee to propose changes to the constitution, which would then be submitted to voters. The council will have the power to issue new laws during the transition, according to a communique read on state television. The military now finds itself confronting the economic problems that fueled the revolt, including massive youth unemployment and economic underdevelopment. Sameh Shoukry, Egypt's ambassador to the United States, said Sunday that the generals have made restoring security and reviving the economy their top priorities. However, a leading opposition figure said Sunday that the military must explain its plans in more detail or see a resumption of the demonstrations that drove Mubarak from office. ""They need to come out of their headquarters and start talking to the people and tell us what is in store for us,"" Mohamed ElBaradei told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" Another opposition figure, Ayman Nour, said Monday that a man with a knife attempted to attack him while he was in Luxor meeting with supporters, who thwarted the man's attempt. The man then attempted to flee, but was arrested by the army, Nour said he was told. Widespread strikes and demonstrations occurred Monday around the country, with thousands of state workers from various ministries demonstrating for better pay and better work conditions, witnesses told CNN. The unrest has nearly emptied tourist hotels. In the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, where Mubarak is reportedly holed up at a villa, ""We are losing daily something like $20 (million) to $30 million -- at least in this area,"" said Adel Shoukry, secretary general of the Egyptian Hotel Association. In London, British Foreign Secretary William Hague told the House of Commons he had encouraged the Egyptian government ""to make further moves to accommodate the views of opposition figures."" He said he was heartened to hear Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq say that members of the opposition should be included in a reshuffled Cabinet during the next week. Hague called for the release of all those detained during the 18 days of demonstrations that preceded Mubarak's resignation and said he wants ""a clear timetable for fair and parliamentary elections."" He added that he welcomes the military council's commitment to ""all regional and international obligations and treaties."" Monday's admonition from the military came as mourners gathered at a marble memorial in Cairo's Tahrir Square to honor the victims of clashes, which began January 25. ""Our country is forever indebted to these warriors,"" said Maha Nasser, who visited the memorial. Some people placed flowers next to pictures of some of the more than 300 people estimated to have died during the 18 days of conflict that led to the ouster of the 82-year-old president, who had ruled with an iron fist for nearly 30 years. A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch called the estimate ""conservative."" Heba Morayef said it was based on the group's visits to just eight hospitals -- five in Cairo, two in Alexandria and one in Suez. ""We were not able to access many other hospitals,"" she said. Morayef expressed concern about the military, too. ""It's unclear to what extent there are any limits on the power of the military, and that, obviously, is something that causes the human rights community some concern,"" she said. But most Egyptians seem ready to give the military a chance to guide the country from dictatorship to democracy. ""Until they do something that's really huge and negative, I'm going to trust them, because we need that trust now,"" said television talk-show host and journalist Yosri Foda. ""The genie is out of the bottle. Egyptians have now managed to rediscover themselves. I'm so proud of this part of the story. Yes, it will always be tempting for an Army man to stick to power. But they, too, probably realize now this is not a good idea."" The direction of the military was just one of many uncertainties that remain. The status of Mubarak, who is reportedly staying in Sharm el-Sheikh, is a mystery. Some Egyptians are demanding he stand trial for crimes, including the demonstrators' deaths. Others are demanding an immediate repeal of Egypt's nearly 30-year-old emergency law, which allows the government to arrest people without charge, and the formation of a civilian body to oversee the transition to a new government. On Monday, Tahrir Square, the center of the protests and the subsequent celebrations, remained a focus of activity, though a much diminished one. Military police dispersed about 70 protesters from the square Monday and did not allow members of the news media to take pictures of the event. While the army detained protesters who tried to remain in the square, officials said they released the protesters after removing them from the square and used the practice to disperse the crowds. A group of police officers joined demonstrators Monday, a sharp contrast to the clashes between police and protesters during the early days of the uprising. ""We didn't want to attack the protesters, but they (our superiors) told us if we didn't, they would put us in jail ... if we disobeyed their orders,"" one of the officers, Yousef Abdullah, said Monday. Their role in supporting the Mubarak regime through the years has left the police widely unpopular. In the aftermath of the demonstrations, some police stations were looted and set ablaze. Though many residents recognize the role of police is critical to any society, only traffic cops were back on the streets of Cairo Monday. Regular police, afraid of being harassed, don't walk their beats, a spokesman said. To make up for their absence, some people have organized neighborhood-watch groups. Events in Egypt have been watched closely throughout the region. For the third day in a row, clashes broke out Monday between pro- and anti-government demonstrators in Yemen's capital of Sanaa. About 200 anti-government protesters rallied outside Sanaa University calling for regime change. And on Monday, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe1 that the country's state of emergency -- in place for almost two decades -- will be lifted in the ""coming days."" The announcement came two days after anti-government protesters in Algeria chanted, ""Change the power!"" Security forces clashed with the crowds Saturday in Algiers and detained roughly 100 protesters, according to the opposition Algerian League for Human Rights. Ambassador Shoukry said it was a ""matter of pride"" for Egyptians that their revolution was ""organized and peaceful.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Fullerton, California, police officer charged with second-degree murder in the beating death of a mentally ill homeless man was released from jail Thursday after posting a bond in lieu of $1 million bail, the Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. Manuel Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the Fullerton Police Department, is also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the July death of Kelly Thomas, 37. Ramos' family and friends raised the $100,000 for the bond -- which typically is 10% of the bail -- to secure his release from custody, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County sheriff. Ramos was released shortly after midnight Thursday, Amormino said. ""By the time they do the paperwork and things of that nature, many times it's that late in the morning,"" Amormino told CNN. Thomas' father, Ron, 55, of Cypress, California, objected to Ramos' release and said Ramos should have been held without bail. ""I don't want him released because he brutally murdered my son,"" said Thomas, who's a safety consultant for the construction industry. He was an Army Ranger in special ops for 10 years; a martial arts master, he now teaches hand-to-hand combat to Marines going to Iraq and Afghanistan, he said. Also charged in the Thomas case is Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. He was released last week on $25,000 bail. Both officers have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men are among six Fullerton police officers -- all men -- who were involved in the Thomas arrest and have been placed on involuntary, paid administrative leave. The FBI is also investigating the incident for civil rights violations. Ron Thomas, the father, said Thursday he wants criminal charges against each of the other four officers. ""Even if he just stood there and did absolutely nothing, that's what he should be charged with. He didn't prevent my son's death,"" Thomas said. The Orange County district attorney's office said this month that no charges were filed against the other four because ""the evidence does not show knowing participation in an unlawful act on the part of these officers."" Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old homeless man with schizophrenia, was beaten by police during an altercation July 5 and died five days later. The case drew widespread attention to the police department of Fullerton, about 25 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Since then, two other allegations of brutality at the hands of city police have surfaced, both regarding unrelated arrests in 2010. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and fellow prosecutors viewed 16 minutes of bus depot surveillance video showing what happened in the Thomas case, Rackauckas has said. Thomas suffered brain injuries, facial fractures, rib fractures, and extensive bruising and abrasions, the prosecutor's office said. The Orange County coroner listed his manner of death as a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Ramos had made initial contact with Thomas -- whom he knew as a ""homeless drifter"" -- after police received a call about a homeless man looking in car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars, Rackauckas said. ""He lifted his fists to Kelly Thomas and he said, 'You see my fist? Now they're getting to ready to F you up,' "" Rackauckas said, using ""F"" instead of the full profanity. The district attorney said Ramos' conduct was unacceptable and ""not protecting and serving"" the public. ""Ramos had to know that he was creating a situation where Kelly Thomas feared for his life and was struggling to get away from an armed officer who was going to 'F him up,'"" Rackauckas said. Cicinelli arrived at the scene later. He is accused of using excessive force when he allegedly assaulted and beat Thomas, including using the front end of his Taser to hit the victim on the head and face eight times while the man was pinned to the ground by other officers. At that point, Thomas was making no audible sounds, indicating that he was ""down and seriously injured,"" the prosecutor's office said.

"(CNN)--He doesn't know how old he is, but he thinks he's 7. His name is Khin Zaw Lin. He's lived in a garbage dump virtually his entire life. Khin Zaw Lin lives in a Thai garbage dump with only his adopted mother and his toy gun to  protect him. I find Lin walking in a festering landscape of rotting food, plastic bags and junk at the Mae Sot garbage dump in Thailand near the Thai-Myanmar border. His parents are long gone. His home is a makeshift shelter made from salvaged bags, cloth and wood. Lin is one of about 300 refugees in the dump who survive on other people's trash. Many are children. Some are women with babies. Their daily routine follows the same pattern: They mill about the dump, waiting for the next truck to arrive, hoping for enough discarded food to get them through the day. Lin pokes through the rubbish with a machete. He says he collects bottles and plastic for three cents a sack. He shows me his feet, which were filthy and ribbed with cuts. He tells me through an interpreter that he can't afford shoes. He walks barefoot through the treacherous landscape. My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma. I found it hard to believe at first, but I was curious. I persuaded my camera crew to make the six-hour drive from Bangkok. When we arrive at the dump, people are afraid of us. We'd been told there are orphans living at the dump, but people are wary. They think we are there to take away the orphans or ask for bribes. I tell them I want to help, and I am eventually directed to Lin. He greets me with a soft, hoarse voice. But he's all energy and purpose when he resumes plucking bottles from the mountain of trash. A recycling firm offers the closest thing to steady employment for Lin and his family. It buys what bottles and plastics Lin and others salvage. Lin gives the money to his adopted mother. She tells me that Lin's biological mother gave him to her in Myanmar when he was a baby because she couldn't cope with the responsibility. Life under the military junta in Myanmar can be brutal. The country's economy is collapsing, and torture and rape under the country's military regime is commonplace. Lin's new mother decided to flee to Thailand in search of a better life. She found a garbage dump instead. Still, she says scavenging for food in the dump is actually an improvement on her previous life. As I listen to Lin's story, a question keeps going through my mind: How can a 7-year-old spend his entire childhood in this squalor?  Watch as Lin and others root through the dump » . Perhaps it's because Lin is invisible -- he doesn't have a passport or papers. He is part of special group of refugees from Myanmar that don't officially exist. The United Nations established refugee camps in Thailand for those who flee Myanmar, but the camps are reserved only for victims of political persecution. Refugees fear if they enter a refugee camp, they'll be classified as migrant workers and deported. As a result, these refugees are trapped in the garbage dump -- not enough money to go elsewhere and no prospects back home. I thought I had become accustomed to the grinding poverty I had encountered in parts of Asia. I've met my fair share of children who are denied the luxury of hope. But Lin's story angers me. I feel close to losing all objectivity. Near the end of my meeting with Lin, I ask his adopted mother if she, and Lin, would ever escape the rubbish dump. Her answer is as hard as the world she and Lin inhabit. ""Never."" E-mail to a friend .","Orphan boy eats discarded food to survive .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's military has launched a plan to swiftly enact constitutional reforms, an important step to get the embattled Arab nation back in working order, political and military figures said Tuesday. The military has formed ""an apolitical and independent constitutional committee"" to propose constitutional reforms within 10 days, according to Wael Ghonim, the activist who spearheaded the protests that toppled of former President Hosni Mubarak's regime. After that plan is forged, a referendum will be held on the measures within two months, Ghonim said in a statement on the social media website Facebook. State-run television said a retired judge, Tarek Beshri, will head the panel. It also reported that Mohammed Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, met Tuesday with the panel to make sure plans are on target for the reforms. This is the latest transitional step in Egypt, where the military has been in charge since Friday, after Mubarak's resignation was announced. The top military leaders dissolved parliament, suspended the constitution and vowed to remain in charge until elections can be held in six months or so. The unprecedented changes in the most populous Arab nation have been watched closely throughout the Middle East and North Africa, where more unrest has unfolded in places such as Iran, Bahrain, Algeria and Yemen. The protests in Egypt aren't over either. State media reported Tuesday that 3,000 police officers protested outside police headquarters in the central city of Sohaj for better working conditions, pay raises and the removal of their superiors. The protesters attempted to storm the provincial police chief's office, but he escaped out the back door. Representatives from the protesters met with officials and they were promised a review of policies and demands to be brought before the Interior Ministry, state media said. Ghonim learned about the constitutional referendum timetable on Monday during a meeting with members of the Egyptian military -- which assumed power last week when the nation's longtime president stepped down after 18 days of tenacious anti-government street demonstrations. He and seven other leaders of the youth uprising sat down with two representatives of the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, a session ""to understand the Armed Forces' perspective on things."" ""We felt an honest desire to protect gains from the revolution and unprecedented respect for the opinions expressed by the youth,"" Ghonim said. ""We noticed the absence of the father-to-child-like instructions as they spoke to the youth."" The meeting touched on many issues, according to Ghonim's statement, and the officers' comments provided an insight into the military's stance and thinking. Ghonim said the military officials noted that they don't want to rule the country and believe that developing a civilian government is the only option for moving Egypt forward. As for future voting, the military says citizens will use their national identification cards to vote on the constitutional reform referendum and presidential elections. They will use their voting cards to participate in elections for parliament. The only reason the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took charge was to protect the ""legitimacy of the January 25th revolution,"" Ghonim said. They said they are working fast to achieve reform and normalcy. They urged the youth to take ""serious steps"" to establish political parties that reflect their opinions and the officers agreed to have regular meetings with the young people who participated in the uprising. Also, Ghonim said, the military vowed to search for people who went missing during the nation's 18-day revolt, and a list of names of the missing will be published Tuesday. Touching on the damage to the economy, the military agreed to begin a campaign to collect 100 billion Egyptian pounds to rebuild the country.  This comes as Egypt's Central Bank announced in a statement Tuesday that banks will be closed on Wednesday and Thursday -- the last two days of the country's work week. Military leaders also underscored the importance of returning to work and investing in Egypt in order to encourage the return of tourism -- an all-important industry for the country. The unrest has nearly emptied tourist hotels. In the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, where Mubarak is reportedly holed up at a villa, ""We are losing daily something like $20 (million) to $30 million -- at least in this area,"" said Adel Shoukry, secretary general of the Egyptian Hotel Association. Meanwhile, the youth movement isn't the only sector in Egypt using social media. The country's Interior Ministry is trying to connect with the public through Facebook -- which some credit with helping topple a regime of almost 30 years. The ministry created a Facebook page in an attempt to bring back ""good relations with the public and improve the image of Egyptian police,"" according to a statement carried by state media. CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this report.","NEW:  State media: 3,000 police officers protest for better working conditions .

"(CNN) -- Big-spending Shanghai Shenhua have been stripped of their 2003 league title and handed a $160,000 fine in the latest crackdown by Chinese football authorities against match-fixing . Shenhua, who achieved worldwide prominence with their audacious signing of Chelsea's Didier Drogba last year, will also start the next Chinese Super League (CSL) with a six-point deduction. Shenhua were among 12 clubs handed punishments, while 33 people, including disgraced officials Xie Yalong and Nan Yong, received life bans, according to the official Chinese news agency Zinhua. Former Chinese national team players - Shen Si, Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming -- who were jailed for five-and-a-half years last year for taking bribes -- were also banned for life, as was former World Cup referee Lu Jun. In 2009 the Chinese Football Association (CFA) launched an investigation into corruption in 2009 in an attempt to clean up their game. ""Acts of corruption violated national laws, and did serious damage to the image of Chinese football,"" said a statement on the CFA's official website. Xie and Nan, who were both high-profile former heads of the CFA, were each given jail sentences of 10-and-a-half years as a result of the investigation, ahead of the further football related punishments announced Monday. Shenhua, who also signed Drogba's former Chelsea teammate Nicolas Anelka, were found guilty of fixing a game against Shanxi Guoli during the 2003 season. Fellow CSL side Tianjin Teda were also found to have fixed a match in the same season and, like Shenhua, were deducted six points and fined one million yuan ($160,000). In total, 12 clubs were handed ""disciplinary punishments"" while former Chinese international Xu Hong, who recently became coach of CSL Dalian Arbin, was among a further 25 people banned from the game for five years. Allegations of corruption linked to gambling have long damaged the reputation of Chinese football, but the acquisition of Ivory Coast star Drogba, fresh from helping Chelsea to win the 2012 European Champions League, was seen as a major coup. He was joining Anelka, who signed in January 2012, but both have subsequently left the club, with Drogba joining Turkish champions Galalatasaray on an 18-month deal while Anelka is on loan at Italian giants Juventus. The punishments announced by the CFA follow the revelations earlier this month of widespread fixing of European football matches. European law enforcement agency Europol announced on February 4 that 380 games in Europe -- including World Cup and European Championship qualifiers and two Champions League games -- have been deemed suspicious. Prior to the Europol announcement, FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke told CNN that match-fixing was a ""disease"" as he responded to lifetime bans handed out in January to 41 South Korean players found guilty of attempting to influence the result of games. The CFA insisted that their anti-corruption drive has achieved ""positive results"" and in its statement claimed that ""public enthusiasm for football is gradually restored, with the audience and television viewers for the CSL at record highs."" But mired by the controversies, China's national team has been struggling to make an impression and failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup after finishing third in a group behind Iraq and Jordan.","Didier Drogba's former club found guilty of match-fixing .

"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition leader Moaz al-Khatib tried to resign Sunday, but was told he couldn't. Al-Khatib will remain as head of the Syrian National Coalition until the group's next general meeting, Sanir Ahmed, Syrian National Coalition spokesman, told CNN. The executive committee rejected the resignation. He ""has taken the realm of the national coalition at a critical stage and he was able to garner great popularity and establish unity among ranks of the opposition. So he is to remain in his position for now,"" Ahmed said. No date for the meeting has been set. Earlier, al-Khatib announced his resignation in a written statement, and accused world powers of using the Syrian crisis to advance their own interests. ""I promised the Syrian people and God to resign if matters reach some red lines,"" he wrote. He wanted to step down, he said, ""so I could work with more freedom unavailable to me within the official position of the organization."" Last week, a Syrian opposition alliance elected Ghassan Hitto -- who had studied and lived in the United States -- to lead the opposition's interim government. Hitto went to Syria on Sunday, according to a Facebook post from the Syrian National Coalition, crossing the border with Turkey and meeting with rebel leaders in Aleppo. In a statement about the resignation, Mohammed Ali, a spokesman for al-Khatib, said, ""For two years now we've been slaughtered. We keep hearing that we will get arms, then that we won't get arms. Everyone is trading in the Syrian crisis for their own interest and agenda. The international community is doing nothing."" ""Everything that has happened to the Syrian people -- including the destruction of their infrastructure, arrest of tens of thousands of its sons, and the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands, and other tragedies -- have not been enough to cause an international decision to be taken to allow the people to defend themselves,"" the statement said. The news comes two days before members of the Arab League are scheduled to meet in Doha, Qatar. Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said Sunday he is looking forward to the participation of the interim government at the meeting. Al-Khatib apparently has wanted to leave his position for some time. He favored having an executive committee lead the group rather than one interim leader. Before news of the group's refusal to let al-Khatib step down now, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he likes al-Khatib personally and was sad to see him go. ""The notion he might resign has been expressed on many an occasion and is not a surprise,"" Kerry said. Change within the opposition leadership is inevitable, and the United States ""views this as a continuum,"" he said. ""The opposition is more than one person,"" Kerry said. Israeli troops under fire . The Israeli military, meanwhile, said its troops came under fire Sunday in the Golan Heights from the Syrian side -- and soldiers returned fire. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon blamed the Syrian military for the incident. ""We view very harshly the fire opened last night and this morning, from the direction of Syria on an IDF (Israel Defense Forces) force in Israeli territory,"" Yaalon said. ""We will not allow the Syrian army or any other factor to violate Israeli's sovereignty by firing into our territory."" IDF said no casualties or damage had been reported on the Israeli side of the border, but it was continuing to monitor the situation in the border area. Syria's opposition network, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said rebels were clashing with the Syrian army near the Golan Heights border at the time. Fighting in the area has intensified in recent days as rebels backed by Nusra Front fighters gain territory. The radical Islamist al-Nusra Front has emerged as one of the most effective groups in the Syrian resistance, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. In December, the U.S. State Department moved to blacklist the rebel group as a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq. President Shimon Peres said Israel had high hopes when Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who trained in London to become a doctor, was elected president. Al-Assad seemed to be ""a modern young doctor,"" Peres said.. ""It turned out to be a cover,"" Peres said. ""He tried to build a nuclear bomb and he built a chemical arsenal. Fortunately, the nuclear installation is destroyed. Unluckily the chemical arsenal remained."" He added, ""What's happening in Syria is a tragedy for Syria.""

"(CNN) -- Let's assume you live in Utah, Hawaii or South Carolina, and you go to Nevada for a vacation. While in Las Vegas, you spend some money in the casinos. Gambling is illegal in the state where you live, so should the cops in your home state be able to track your activities and arrest you for what happened in Nevada? The answer, needless to say, is no. Or at least it should be no. Common sense tells us that state laws should only apply to things that happen inside a state's borders. But this sensible principle is being tossed out the window by the U.S. Senate, which has approved a proposal that would give states the ability to impose their taxes on out-of-state sellers. Many people think this is a debate about ""taxing the Internet,"" but that's a misleading characterization. If a merchant in your state makes an online sale to you or your neighbor, that seller will collect the sales tax levied by your state. And if a merchant in another state makes an online sale to you or your neighbor, that seller is subject to any taxes imposed by the state where it is based. But some governors and state legislators don't like this system because many states don't bother imposing any tax on sales to out-of-state consumers. And even if states levied taxes on sales to out-of-state consumers, what about the five states that don't have any sales tax? Wouldn't those states become ""tax havens"" for Internet sales? For these reasons, some politicians fret that the Internet will put competitive pressure on them to keep their sales tax rates from getting too high. These concerns are overblown. People generally shop online because of convenience, not tax savings. But it's also a good thing when states are forced to compete with each other. States with no payroll income taxes, such as Nevada, Florida, Tennessee, Texas and New Hampshire, help restrain the greed of politicians in states that have punitive income tax systems, such as California, Illinois, New York and Massachusetts. And if politicians in the high-tax states refuse to adjust their bad tax policies, then people should have the freedom to escape and earn income in other states. The same principle applies to sales taxes. If politicians in, say, Arizona are worried that consumers will go online or travel across the border to avoid the punitive sales tax, then they should reduce their sales tax rate. Politicians can choose to maintain uncompetitive tax systems, of course, but they also should be prepared to accept the consequences. I don't think California and Illinois should try to become the France and Greece of America, but that's something for the voters of those states to figure out for themselves. In any event, they shouldn't have the right to force out-of-state sellers to act as deputy tax collection officials if they decide to impose bad tax policy. But this debate isn't just about tax policy and the proper limits of state government power. The bill still must go through the U.S. House, where the GOP is divided on the issue. If politicians in Washington approve the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act, they'll not only be authorizing extraterritorial tax enforcement, they'll also be setting in motion the creation of a database that will erode privacy for consumers and create opportunities for identity theft. This is because the legislation only can be enforced if governments set up some sort of system for tracking where consumers live, what they buy and how much it costs. With 9,600 sales tax jurisdictions in the United States (cities and counties also impose sales taxes), this is a compliance nightmare. And it means that your personal and financial details will be collected and stored in a database that will be a magnet for criminals and hackers from all over the world. To be blunt, a sales tax cartel is bad news for tax policy and bad news for privacy. Let's limit the power of state governments so they can only screw up things inside their own borders. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel J. Mitchell.","The Senate approved of a bill that will require online retailers to collect sales taxes .

"Washington (CNN) -- From end to end, the National Mall has looked like a construction site all summer, providing a detour instead of a destination for many tourists, joggers and other visitors. That will change this weekend, when the renovated Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool at the west end will be filled to its new capacity. And fresh turf at the other end will soon be taking root ahead of January's presidential Inauguration. ""It is indeed disruptive,"" said Bob Vogel, the National Park Service's superintendent for the Mall area, acknowledging that for ""some people, this may be their first and only trip to Washington, D.C., and we hate areas shut down."" Especially in hot weather, the Reflecting Pool at the foot of the Lincoln Memorial draws visitors to sit by the water. But in a project that began in late 2010, the pool was drained of 7 million gallons of water, the foundation dug up and removed, and, in the months that followed, a new concrete base poured and sealed. Most of the work is done, and as of Wednesday, ""the pool's about half full,"" said Scott Stephenson of Corman Construction, the contractor doing the renovations. ""We have about, almost 2 million gallons of water to go yet."" A year after quake, Washington Monument still under repair . Reflecting Pool should be refilled by weekend . Barring complications, pumps that are drawing water from the Tidal Basin along the Potomac River will have topped off the Reflecting Pool by this weekend. The old structure held more water, but filtering was poor, and the foundation was leaking. The new structure is shallower, with better filtration for less water, and the concrete floor is tinted to maintain its visual impact of reflection. At the east end of the Mall, nearest the U.S. Capitol, earth-moving equipment, mountains of topsoil and teams of construction crews are finishing some yard work that will create a more durable place for inaugural spectators and other gatherings. Two joggers stopped at a sign the park service had placed at the edge of the site to help people make sense of all the activity as visitors detour around temporary fences, concrete barriers and construction apparatus. ""It definitely gives us an uglier view as we run in the mornings,"" Diana Schneider said, ""and the dust, the noise level as well, so, yeah, it's been here a while, and we can't wait to get finished."" Turf ready for presidential inauguration in January . Vogel explained that crews ""are re-engineering the soil, we are collecting storm water in large cisterns, we have an irrigation system in place, and eventually we'll be placing new sod"" to take root during the current growing season through autumn. ""We do think that this is going to lead to a better end product, and it's going to sustain the Mall for future generations,"" Vogel said. He says the turf project must include the spring and summer months to help the newly planted grass thrive. The area has been a prime gathering point for a view to presidential inaugurations at the West Front of the U.S. Capitol. And Vogel says the turf will be ready for crowds by January. Farther along the Mall, the Washington Monument remains closed because of damage from an earthquake that took place a year ago, on August 23, 2011. The National Park Service will soon announce the contract for repairs to the obelisk. A reopening date for the monument has not been announced. Where to find exceptional America .

"New York (CNN) -- More than 100 people who lost their homes in a fire that devastated Long Island's Rockaway peninsula during Superstorm Sandy last fall have filed a lawsuit against the power companies they claim are responsible, according to their attorney. The fire, which destroyed 126 homes and damaged 22 in the Breezy Point neighborhood, began when rising sea water came into contact with the electrical system of a home around 8:30 p.m. on October 29, according to the Fire Department New York. The fire was not brought under control until around 6:30 the next morning because the storm surge flooding kept firefighters out of the area. Fueled by hurricane-force winds, the fire quickly spread from home to home, FDNY said in a press release in December. The lawsuit argues that Long Island Power Authority and National Grid should have shut off power to their neighborhood, in the New York City borough of Queens, before the bad weather hit, as they did with Fire Island, just off the south shore of Long Island. Bloomberg wants to spend billions on storm, climate change . ""Had LIPA and National Grid acted responsibly in preparing for the storm, my clients would be living in their homes with all of their life's possessions, and these two communities would not look like a war zone,"" the plaintiffs' attorney, Keith Sullivan, said in a statement released Tuesday. Billy Heeran, 35, lost the restaurant his family had owned for 33 years in the fire. A firefighter who has lived in the Rockaways his whole life, Heeran was also one of the men fighting the fires in Breezy Point that night. His second-floor condo in the area that overlooks the beach was safe by just inches, he said. ""I just want not a penny more, not a penny less than what it costs to rebuild,"" Heeran said. Although the lawsuit does not seek a specific dollar amount, the damages to the area exceeded $80 million, and continue to rise since none of the 120 clients have been able to begin rebuilding, Sullivan said. Sandy relief: The need continues . Heeran said his insurance claim covered only about a quarter of the $2.5 million to $3 million it would cost to rebuild his business. He, along with his brother, father and business partner, had paid off the mortgage to the restaurant 15 years ago, he said. ""We shouldn't have to pay another mortgage again for something that could have been prevented,"" he said. ""Electricity and salt water is a deadly combination, we would have thought the power companies knew this already,"" Sullivan said. LIPA officials stood by their actions in a written statement. ""While we are sensitive to those families and individuals who suffered tragic losses from Sandy, the effort to place fault for this tragedy with the utility is misplaced,"" the statement says. Sullivan, who is from the Rockaway area, said the issue has become very personal for him. ""We all watched those fires rage during the storm and were standing in front of the homes that were reduced to smoldering ash and rubble the next morning, trying to make sense of why this was allowed to happen,"" he said. Weather disasters cost $110 billion in 2012 .","A fire sparked by Superstorm Sandy destroyed 126 homes on Long Island .

"(CNN) -- A first-edition Harry Potter book was sold for about $19,000, according to an auction house in Dallas, Texas. Normal copies of the Harry Potter books go for under $20, unlike the autographed first edition that sold for $19,000. The soft-cover book was one of 200 copies printed and is a rarity compared with later editions of the popular series that were printed in the millions, the Heritage Auction Galleries said. The book, ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,"" includes an autograph from author J.K. Rowling. It's the first book in the Harry Potter series and was published in the United States under the title ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" The auction had estimated that the 223-page book would sell for as much as $12,000. The winning bid of $19,120 bypassed expectations, but it was not the most expensive sale of Harry Potter-related items in an auction. Last year, an 800-word prequel to the blockbuster Harry Potter novel series fetched nearly $50,000 for a writer's group and dyslexia charity. That prequel was handwritten and signed by Rowling.","The soft-cover ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" is one of 200 copies .

"Washington (CNN) -- Just before Lois Lerner invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions in front of a House committee investigating wrongdoing in the IRS tax-exempt office she ran, she gave an opening statement insisting her innocence. ""I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules and regulations,"" said Lerner at the hearing. She has since been placed on administrative leave. But that statement angered Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa and others on the committee, causing him Thursday to threaten to recall Lerner and force her to answer his questions, believing she had, in fact, waived her constitutional rights. What it means to take 'The Fifth' ""She just testified. She just waived her Fifth Amendment right to privilege,"" South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, said to applause during Wednesday's hearing. ""You don't get to tell your side of the story and then not be subjected to cross-examination. That's not the way it works."" Issa agreed. ""After consulting with counsel, Chairman Issa has concluded that Ms. Lerner's Fifth Amendment assertion is no longer valid. She remains under subpoena, the Committee is looking at recalling her for testimony,"" Oversight committee spokeswoman Becca Glover Watkins told CNN Thursday in a statement. Issa's office declined to explain what his counsel's legal basis was for deciding that her Fifth Amendment assertion is no longer valid. But Democrats and several legal experts think Issa was wrong. ""I'm surprised that chairman Issa's taken that position,"" Ranking House Oversight Committee Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland told CNN on Thursday. ""First, all the law that I've read says that she did not waive her right. As a lawyer I don't believe she waived her right. And I believe that we as a committee should honor one's right, and as a matter of fact."" Some legal experts agree. ""The only true ways to ""lose"" one's rights under the Fifth Amendment are, one, for a court to find that the claimant does not have a reasonable fear of prosecution, because nothing she says could in fact become a helpful link to a prosecution, or two, to get an order of immunity that guarantees that nothing she says will in fact be used to prosecute her,"" said Miguel A. Estrada, a conservative attorney who helps head the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's appellate and constitutional group and who was once nominated by President George W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals. ""The first is unlikely here, and no one is offering to do the second."" It is true that high-profile congressional hearings are equal parts official proceeding and political spectacle. And the very act of being called to testify before Congress can create an impression of guilt in the court of public opinion, even though the congressional panel isn't issuing any kind of legal ruling. In these instances, it might be best to show up with an attorney for the benefit of appearances for the folks back at home watching on television, but plead the ""Fifth"" on sticky legal questions. But even in front of Congress, experts say, a witness doesn't necessarily lose Fifth Amendment protections by speaking first. ""One can invoke the Fifth Amendment at any time. Giving a preamble or any kind of statement doesn't void that,"" said Gloria J. Browne-Marshall, an associate professor who teaches constitutional law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. ""Now does it look suspicious? Yes. Does it undermine the person's credibility? Yes."" Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former lobbyist Jack Abramoff, retired Lt. Col. Oliver North, baseball player Mark McGwire and White House party crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi all invoked Fifth Amendment privilege before Congress due to concerns that anything they may have said could have been used against them in court. And, like Lerner, many of them offered some type of statement before or after taking The Fifth. ""I think what she did was unconventional,"" said Samidh Guha, a former federal prosecutor who now practices at the law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP. ""But it's hyper technical to say she waived her Fifth Amendment privilege."" CNN's Dana Bash and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","Lawmakers, constitutional scholars debate whether Lois Learner waived the ""Fifth""

"(CNN) -- The Internal Revenue Service has admitted that it targeted groups with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their names. We've since learned that a wider array of groups concerned about spending, debt, high taxes, government growth, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights -- basically any conservative or libertarian issue you can name -- was targeted. President Obama said Monday that he was ""outraged"" over the IRS' behavior. He said that those responsible should be held ""fully accountable."" I wonder when that will happen? On Wednesday, the president requested and received the resignation of Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller -- but that is not enough. The executive branch has been aware of this scandal for nearly two years and now, only as a result of massive public pressure, the administration has found a scapegoat. The president did not announce that Miller was responsible, and we still don't know who came up with the idea to target the tea party. We have not been told whether Obama administration officials knew about the discrimination and if they allowed it to continue when they found out. Forcing out Miller is not the end of this scandal. Holding the guilty parties accountable is just the first step. But if the handling of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, is any indication, there are no guarantees this will happen. The IRS is under the president's jurisdiction. He needs to fully recognize the gravity of these charges. The IRS targeting citizens for political reasons is not simply another Washington scandal. At issue is something that strikes at the very heart of who we are as a people, what we believe as Americans and what this country has always stood for. The First Amendment was written to protect many different types of expression. But the Founding Fathers' primary concern -- and a first principle for every generation of Americans that followed -- was the protection of political speech. Apparently, the IRS was even targeting people who criticized how the country was being run. Protecting citizens' right to speak out against their government has always been an integral part of what separates us from tyrannical regimes. What the IRS did is how the KGB used to target dissidents. It is how they deal with troublemakers in China. It is not how we treat American citizens. Our Constitution guarantees it. This week, I introduced a Senate Resolution condemning the IRS' actions and calling for a full investigation into how the agency infringed upon the First Amendment rights of those targeted. Democrats put a hold on my resolution. We have learned that some officials knew about these indiscretions long before the recent denials. We wanted to investigate to find out who knew what, when, and for how long. We have learned that some tea party groups had unduly long wait times for tax-exempt status. Some eventually withdrew their applications out of frustration. In my home state of Kentucky, a 9/12 group filed for 501(c)(4) status in December of 2010. It received its first correspondence almost immediately, saying there would be a determination within 90 days. Fourteen months later, the IRS requested answers to 30 questions with sub-bullets -- 88 total separate inquiries -- and gave only a two-week period to comply. The Kentucky 9/12 Project's Eric Wilson estimated that it would have taken 5,000 pages to respond. Eventually, the IRS granted granted this group tax-exempt status -- after well over a year. We wanted to find out why they had to wait. We wanted to find out what groups, and how many, might have been victims of political discrimination. We wanted to ask for an independent authority to investigate and seek criminal charges against those who were involved in targeting Americans for their political views. We wanted to determine if the White House was aware and failed to take action. This is not about Republican vs. Democrat or conservative vs. liberal. It is about arrogant and unrestrained government vs. the rule of law. Imagine if the IRS had targeted liberal or progressive groups under the Bush administration. The First Amendment cannot be renegotiated depending on which party holds power. The power to tax is the power to destroy. These allegations concerning the IRS remind us yet again of the inherently destructive nature of leviathan. With Obamacare adding staff and hundreds of millions to the budget of the IRS, the new and intrusive powers granted to our nation's revenue collection service were worrisome enough. We should use this recent abuse of power as an opportunity to rein them in. Each congressman and senator, and even the president, took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. It is now upon us to determine if the IRS intentionally trampled the First Amendment rights of Americans who dared to dissent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rand Paul.","Rand Paul: Forcing out acting IRS commissioner isn't a sufficient remedy to scandal .
By political targeting, IRS endangered the heart of U.S. democracy, he says .

"(CNN) -- So finally, Madonna's honeymoon with Malawi has ended with a spat. Malawi's minister of education accused Madonna of ""bullying officials"" and exaggerating the extent of her charity in the country. Trouble started when the government withdrew her VIP status and she therefore had to wait in line like everyone else to go through immigration. President Joyce Banda said that Madonna felt her charitable work meant that Malawi should ""be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude."" For her part, Madonna described the reports as inaccurate, and and pledged to continue helping educate young girls in the nation. For some years now, Madonna had literally and figuratively adopted that country, and two of its children. She also made a documentary. But it was clear that her relationship with Malawi, like many other patron-client relations, would lead to quarrels and recriminations. Many of the current Western missions of charity in Africa carry an underlying tendency towards self-righteousness on the part of donors and with it, a sense of entitlement. Some of those who give charity expect the recipients to treat them with deference and to attend to their every whim. Yet Madonna is not alone. There is a growing movement in the West by celebrities to champion causes in poor countries. Lately, Angelina Jolie has become the champion of the people of eastern Congo. She joined George Clooney, who has been leading the cause of the new state of South Sudan. Read also: 'A people under siege' in South Sudan . Oprah Winfrey is educating teenage girls in South Africa. And most prominent of them all is Irish rock star Bono, of U2 fame. He is the leading spokesman for the entire continent on matters of poverty and aid. Even Western governments listen to him when discussing their economic policies towards Africa -- preferring his counsel to that of the continent's democratically elected leaders. All too often, these campaigns are not about the welfare of the people they claim to be helping but act as a platform for celebrities to promote their brand to their audiences at home by exhibiting their humanity. So some come to save orphans, others to defend human rights, feed the hungry, treat the sick, educate our children, protect the environment, end civil wars, negotiate aid and promote family planning, lest we overproduce ourselves. It is almost as if Africans cannot do anything by themselves and need a combination of Mother Teresa and Santa Claus to survive. Of course, these initiatives have on occasion contributed something positive to the wellbeing of those affected by such generosity. They have also shed light on the problems that sometimes get ignored and thus brought international attention to them. Yet for the most part, the long-term consequences of these celebrity campaigns far outweigh whatever short-term benefits they bring. For example, the Africans subject to this generosity are not active participants in the campaigns meant for their own good. Instead, they are depicted and presented as passive recipients of international charity. The tendency to treat Africans as children to be helped is a relic of our colonial past. For then, white superintendents treated every African, whatever their age, as a child. This patronizing attitude sometimes gets accepted by its victims and is central to the stifling of self-initiative and to creating a dependency mentality among Africans. For celebrities to ""save"" Africa they need a specific presentation of the continent and its people. So they use images of starving children, sick mothers, hungry villages, rampaging warlords, and corrupt politicians. While these images depict a part of Africa's reality, they do not tell the whole story about the continent. They crowd out the other part of Africa's reality -- of innovative youth, enterprising individuals, creative organizations and reformist governments. The consequence of this one-sided presentation has been to perpetuate the narrative of Africa as a place of hopelessness, poverty, misery and adversity -- often obscuring the opportunities that abound on the continent. Read this: Is Africa much richer than we think? Thus, as a result of these campaigns, our continent tends to attract the most compassionate people of the West who come to give charity. However, its negative side effect is to scare away the most enterprising people of the West who would bring capital to invest and make money. Even when they do try to do something in Africa, like Bill Gates has done through his foundation, they come as merchants of charity, not enterprise. Thus, although it has achieved short-term humanitarian objectives, in the long term, celebrity activism has killed the goose of private enterprise that is supposed to lay the golden age of prosperity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew M Mwenda.","Madonna and Malawi's government have had a public spat .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- After huffing and puffing up 354 steps to the newly reopened Lady Liberty crown, Aaron Weisinger figured it was time to pop the question to his girlfriend, Erica Breder. Aaron Weisinger proposes to Erica Breder on July Fourth inside the crown of the Statue of Liberty. ""The Fourth of July has always been a favorite holiday, so that was part of it, "" Weisinger said. The couple flew to New York from San Francisco, California, after managing to be among the first 240 people to snag the tickets to the Statue of Liberty crown for its reopening after September 11, 2001. Weisinger got down on one knee inside the narrow, 8-foot-long deck inside the Statue of Liberty's crown, asked Breder to be his wife and offered her a sizeable diamond ring. ""I believe I was silent for several minutes. I was so excited,"" Breder said. Then she said ""yes."" Both said their families came to the United States via Ellis Island. ""My great-grandparents immigrated [from Russia and Hungary],"" Weisinger said. His fiance's relatives arrived from Hungary. ""The thoughts behind the statue and freedom and liberty allowed our parents and great-grandparents before us to have the wonderful lives that we do,"" Weisinger added. Breder said she was thrilled to make the long climb up a steep spiral staircase to stand inside Lady Liberty's crown. ""It was fantastic, much smaller than we had anticipated. The view's fantastic,"" the newly engaged Breder said. New safety measures include double handrails, glass stairwell partitions and careful crowd control, according to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Now, only three groups of 10 visitors per hour are guided up to the crown by a National Park Service ranger. That means only about 87,000 will be able to visit each year. In the past, it took visitors at least an hour and a half to climb from the base to the crown. Now, it takes only about 15 to 20 minutes. A new engineering study showed that there had to be changes to make it easier to exit the crowded staircase. Crown tickets can now be reserved online up to a year in advance, but the statue will close again in two years for additional renovations.","Aaron Weisinger proposed to Erica Breder on July 4 inside the Statue of Liberty .

"(CNN) -- Crews battling the Arizona wildfire that killed 19 firefighters made significant progress Thursday, moving within sight of fully corralling the blaze, authorities announced. Despite still gusty winds and temperatures in the 90s, the Yarnell Hill Fire near Prescott was 80% contained as of Thursday evening, according to Inciweb, a federal website that disseminates information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. That's a significant upgrade from earlier in the day, when it was 45% contained. ""Praise the Lord!"" wrote one person on an official Facebook page dedicated to the fire. The Yavapai County Sheriff's Department has lifted an evacuation order for residents of Peeples Valley, according to Inciweb. Those in the community of Yarnell, which is about 75 miles northwest of Phoenix, still face a mandatory evacuation order. On average, workers are putting in 13- or 14-hour shifts but are able to sleep, shower and eat when they need to, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Suzanne Flory had said. ""We're very safety conscious and we're very careful about not overstressing or overworking anybody and making sure they get that rest that they need."" There are four helicopters battling the blaze, she told reporters. Temperatures reached into the 90s on Thursday, with winds gusting in excess of 20 mph. It should get a little cooler in the coming days, with the thermostat peaking in the 80s and winds expected to be a little calmer. There's also a chance of showers and thunderstorms for the coming week, at least. Rain would be welcome in many ways, though thunderstorms also bring the possibility of lightning that could spark more fires. And wet conditions could also hamper efforts because people could get stuck in mud, explained National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Wallman. The fallen firefighters: Who they where . The Maricopa County medical examiner's office performed autopsies and said Thursday that the causes of death for all 19 were ""fire-related injuries."" The manners of death were described for each as an ""accident."" Plans to remember the 19 firefighters include a memorial service scheduled for Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden will attend the service in Arizona, a senior administration official told CNN on Friday. On Wednesday nearly 600 firefighters and support workers assigned to the fire took a brief break from their hard work to observe a moment of silence in honor of the 19 members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, who died Sunday when the fire took a sudden, unexpected turn. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . The pause coincided with the movement of a convoy of vehicles driven to the fire by the Granite Mountain team. The vehicles are being returned to Prescott, where they were based. To start Wednesday's moment of silence, a loud alert tone sounded on firefighters' radios and an unidentified fire team commander announced, ""As the crew carriers for the Granite Mountain hot shots leaves the Yarnell Hills fire and begin their journey home, all personnel in the incident will observe an operational pause, in observance of our fallen comrades."" How to help the families . The first official service to remember the lost firefighters will be held Tuesday in Prescott Valley. A ceremony is expected to begin at 11 a.m. local time at Tim's Toyota Center, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.

"(CNN) -- First things first: I didn't watch Monday night's Miss Universe Pageant. I did not even know it was on. The last time I might have tuned into such a program was in middle school, the height of insecurity. I was short, scrawny and getting used to my first pair of oversized glasses. My thick dark hair wouldn't lay flat like the blondes with their perfect wispy bangs. Not yet ""developed"" like many of my peers, I'm sure watching glamorous half-naked models parade around on stage was just what my young psyche needed. When I came into work Tuesday morning, I was greeted with an e-mail that made me think about the pageant for the first time in decades. It contained the final question posed to finalist Leila Lopes of Angola, now our universe's newly crowned Miss Universe. ""If you could change one of your physical characteristics,"" the designated judge asked her, ""which one would it be and why?"" Are you (insert profanity) kidding me? After standing under the magnifying glass of millions, this 25-year-old, 5-foot-10 Â½-inch knockout had to publicly contemplate if she was physically good enough. Her response was quick: ""Thank God I am very-well satisfied with the way God created me, and I wouldn't change a thing. I consider myself a woman endowed with inner beauty. ... I have acquired many wonderful principles from my family, and I plan to follow these through the rest of my life. And now I would like to give all of you a piece of advice: Respect one another."" Her answer was applauded. Lopes' win, the first for Angola, was announced soon after. Maybe it's absurd to be dismayed that a question like this would be posed at a beauty pageant. In my worldview, the mere fact that pageants exist is absurd. And I'm not alone. ""It fits into the narrative du jour for women -- my body is infinitely malleable,"" said Courtney Martin, editor of Feministing.com and author of titles including ""Perfect Girls, Starving Daughters: How the Quest for Perfection Is Harming Young Women."" ""If I have enough willpower and money, I can look like anyone,"" she said. ""This invisibilizes physiology and metabolism and leads women to internalize shame when so much is simply not in their control."" We live in a world where in the United States alone $10.1 billion was spent on cosmetic procedures in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. And Miss Universe has got to be the apex of all pageants -- the ultimate aspiration for all those fake-tanned toddlers running around in tiaras, between tantrums, on reality-TV. But, seriously, who came up with this question? Each of the five finalists was asked something different. One judge asked Miss China about nudity on beaches. Another asked Miss Brazil about her stance on war. Miss Philippines had to contemplate if she'd change her religious beliefs in order to marry, and Miss Ukraine was invited to ponder whom in history she'd trade her life with if she had the chance. Lopes drew from a bowl the name of the judge who would ask her a question. Lea Salonga, an award-winning Filipina singer and actress who made a name for herself on Broadway, was the voice behind the question. She looked down at a card and read. But it turns out the question wasn't Salonga's. On Twitter, her fans wanted to know why she asked such a thing. Salonga tweeted that she did not write the question. ""All our questions are pre-written and each judge is assigned one. Luck of the draw,"" Salonga tweeted. The questions were ""written by the guys at Miss Universe"" she said in a response to one fan. ""We had no say"" in what the questions would be, she said in another. Follower @sassy_dimple wanted more. ""I am surprised they have that (question) on their list,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- The Coast Guard has suspended its search for four sailors missing since Saturday after their yacht ran aground off San Francisco. Coast Guard and Air National Guard crews spent two days searching for the four before announcing the suspension Sunday night. ""The decision to suspend a search-and-rescue case like this is never an easy one to make,"" said Capt. Cynthia Stowe. ""The Coast Guard extends our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the lost crewmen and the deceased. They will all be in our thoughts and prayers."" At least one person died and three were rescued from the Low Speed Chase after it grounded near the Farallon Islands, 28 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge. But the remaining four people aboard remained unaccounted for. The 38-foot sailboat was taking part in the Full Crew Farallon Race, a contest that dates to 1907, according to the San Francisco Yacht Club. On Sunday, the yacht club identified three of the missing sailors as Alexis Busch of Larkspur, California; Alan Cahill of Tiburon, California, and Jordan Fromm of Kentfield, California. The yacht club did not identify a fourth person because it said authorities had not notified that person's relatives. It said that Marc Kasanin, 46, of Belvedere, California, had died. The vessel's skipper reported that the yacht was hit by a series of large waves that rolled it over, tossing several crew members overboard and running it aground, the Coast Guard said Sunday. The search effort included three helicopters, a C-130 transport and four Coast Guard vessels, including the cutters Aspen, Pike and Sockeye. Late last month, the Coast Guard rescued racers taking part in an around-the-world contest when a giant wave damaged their yacht off the coast of San Francisco. The Geraldton Western Australia was on the sixth leg of an eight-leg, 11-month race when it was struck March 31.","The yacht was hit by several large waves, causing it to roll over, the Coast Guard says .

"(CNN) -- A suspect in the shooting of a Seattle, Washington, police officer is also believed to be behind the bombing of four police cars, Seattle Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel said at a press conference Saturday. Christopher Monfort, 41, remained hospitalized in serious condition after being shot by officers during a confrontation Friday. ""This man, from everything that we can tell, appears to be a lone domestic terrorist,"" Pugel said. Monfort was in custody at the hospital, but no charges had yet been filed, a Seattle police spokeswoman told CNN. Charges could be filed as early as Monday, she said. Police named Monfort as a suspect in the Halloween night killing of Officer Tim Brenton, who was shot while sitting in his patrol car. A student officer was injured in the attack. Investigators also suspect Monfort in the October 22 arson of four police vehicles with homemade explosives, Pugel said. On Friday, a tipster alerted police to the owner of a Datsun 210 who covered his car shortly after the shooting, Pugel said. While detectives walked near the residence, they came across Monfort, and after a brief questioning, Monfort pulled out a gun and aimed it at one of the officers, police said. Monfort pulled the trigger, and when the gun didn't go off, began to run, Pugel said. When Monfort turned around toward the police with the weapon again, the officers fired, he said. The local sheriff's department would investigate the officer-involved shooting. Investigators found improvised explosive devices and two weapons, including a military assault rifle, inside Monfort's apartment, Pugel said. The suspect's car had not yet been searched. Brenton, 39, a field training officer, was reviewing details of a traffic stop with student officer Brit Sweeney Saturday night when a vehicle rolled up next to the squad car shortly after 10 p.m., authorities said . Several shots were fired into the squad car, killing Brenton and injuring Sweeney, according to police. The shooting was the first intentional homicide of a city police officer since 1994, Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels said. Brenton was married with two children, 11 and 8. He served on the force for nine years, police said. His father and uncle are retired Seattle police officers.","Suspect identified as Christopher Monfort, who was wounded by officers Friday .

"(CNN) -- Nissan North America has announced the recall of nearly 196,000 sport utility vehicles in the United States for corrosion problems that could damage steering and suspension systems. The recall extends to the Nissan Pathfinder from 1997 to 2003, and the Infiniti QX4 from 1996 to 2004. ""In areas of the country in which heavy concentrations of road salt are used, a mixture of snow/water and salt ... may result in corrosion of the strut tower housing in some subject vehicles,"" the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration website said. ""This may lead to grinding noises, increased steering effort, and possibly the steering column to break, resulting in the loss of steering control, which could result in a crash."" Most of the vehicles were sold in Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington D.C., West Virginia and Wisconsin.

"(CNN) -- The Shabiha militia fighters working hand in hand with Syria's military to repress the 15-month-long uprising are President Bashar al-Assad's ""shock troops,"" observers say. ""The regime uses them for the real dirty work, killing and violent action, especially where it has to go into an urban area and repress resistance,"" said Jeff White, defense fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Civil war imminent in Syria, U.N. warns . Blamed for their participation in the Houla and Qubeir massacres and other assaults, there may be tens of thousands of them, mostly but not all members of the Alawite sect that dominates the government, analysts say. U.N. observers come under fire . The Shabiha emerged in the 1970s as Alawite gangsters from the coastal region with ties to the al-Assad family. They were involved in drug- and weapons-smuggling from Lebanon, where they moved those and more benign products from the more robust economy next door into the closed Syrian society. The name Shabiha is thought to be taken from the Arabic word for ""ghost."" Photos: In Syria, families flee and rebels fight . One Syrian writer, Yassin al-Haj Shalih, says it refers to people operating ""outside the law and living in the shadows."" He and others also think it might be taken from ""shabah,"" the name of a Mercedes model that Shabiha members drove. After the uprising started last year, the Shabiha were enlisted as regime fighters, and the meaning of the term is widely regarded as ""thug."" The name fits, said Michael Weiss, a Syria expert at the UK-based Henry Jackson Society. They used to smuggle drugs and weapons, Weiss said, but ""now they are being used as butchers."" Weiss said the government has been blaming the violence across Syria on anti-regime forces. But he said the Shabiha, in fact, ""are the armed gangs"" terrorizing the populace. Sometimes Shabiha wear fatigue pants and T-shirts and have been seen on army tanks. They drive around in white pickups brandishing weapons, Weiss said, and they look like ""muscleheads with bulging physiques."" Many have shaved heads and sport thick black beards. Syria: How a year of horror unfolded . The beards are a confusing touch, Weiss said, because they ""want to look like Salafists"" so people will think they are the fundamentalist Sunnis they dislike and blame for violence. Shabiha have broken up demonstrations and harassed diplomats, said Andrew Tabler, Syria expert for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He also said people have come under international sanctions for directing Shabiha activities. Opinion: The only glimmer of hope for Syria . Calling them the ""black market"" version of the Syrian security forces, Weiss said they spy for the regime and keep weapons away from resistance fighters by purchasing as many as they can on the black market. Weiss said they also plunder property, gang rape and engage in summary executions. ""Houla was the global recognition of what they'd been up to,"" he said. The regime uses Shabiha for ""plausible deniability,"" Weiss said. For example, the government can say the military wasn't involved in house-to-house raids actually conducted by Syrian security forces. Massacre in Syrian town feels eerily familiar . Analysts say the Shabiha also operate in other parts of the country, such as Deir Ezzor in the east. Weiss said there are reports of other pro-government proxies, such as Kurdish militants, Shiite militants from Lebanon and Iraq, and Iranian forces. The Alawite region is largely along the coast, with Latakia at its center. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies and associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Alawites live ""cheek by jowl"" near Sunnis in Homs, Hama and Idlib province in the west. He describes that as a ""poor band of countryside"" that's the ""center of the revolution."" ""Not good fences,"" he said. In a recent essay, Landis wrote that ""since the start of the uprising, many Syrian tribesmen have supported the state's security apparatus, controlled by the Assad family. This is not a new practice, and Syrian tribes have been used as enforcers for the Syrian government for decades. In many restive regions of Syria, tribesmen are deployed by the Syrian military as paramilitary forces called Shabiha."" He wrote they have also been referred to as ""jahaaz, which means 'apparatus,' as in a security apparatus, but has the connotation of 'political tools.'"" Landis notes that in the 1970s, the ""feared"" Shabiha also played an important role in providing Syrians' goods, from mayonnaise to toothpaste. ""They became this super-regime dedicated element, whose livelihood and future were dependent on the regime,"" Landis said. When the troubles started, the regime turned to its indigenous muscle for help, mobilized their networks and ""turned them into special forces and shock troops."" ""This was necessary because the multi-ethnic army became undependable,"" Landis said of the huge army with a strong Sunni presence. ""They are defecting and don't want to shoot. They won't shoot at other Sunnis."" Russia, China call for non-intervention . As a result, the regime cycled in ""tons of shabiha who are going to do the heavy lifting,"" and tit-for-tat sectarian blood vendettas have unfolded. He said the recent massacres indicate that the Shabiha are gaining power and influence while the regime is ""flailing around"" and ""losing control of the Syrian army."" ""Irregular or special forces are increasingly calling the shots,"" he said. Landis likened the situation to Iraq, where minority Sunnis who prevailed during the Saddam Hussein regime lost their clout after a populace dominated by Shiites and Kurds took power. Some Shabiha might hail from other communities, such as the Sunni or Christian. But the mostly Alawite membership join up for money and because they believe they will be persecuted by a Sunni-dominated opposition if al-Assad's regime is toppled, analysts say. The Alawites, who dominate state ministries and have more jobs than other ethnic groups, are clinging to the top and know they will face a ""bleak future."" ""All the incentives are to back the regime. They got their backs against the wall. There's going to be hell to pay when they lose power,"" Landis said. For now, White said, the resistance has learned to spot the pro-regime fighters. The Free Syrian Army opposition fighters have been attacking the Shabiha and getting their weapons. ""It looks like the FSA has a lot more guns,"" he said. ""I'm not seeing a lot of reports of them running low.""","The Shabiha emerged in the '70s as a criminal gang .
The word might be derived from the name of a Mercedes .

"(CNN) -- It'll be firecracker hot in the Southwest on the Fourth of July, but the Southeast and Ohio River Valley will be so drenched that floods are possible. Meanwhile, the Northeast will get a reprieve from storms that left knee-deep flooding in some areas. ""The most widespread showers and thunderstorms on Thursday will be from the central Gulf Coast northward into the Ohio River Valley,"" the National Weather Service said. ""There is a slight risk of excessive rainfall/flash flooding across much of the Southeast through Wednesday."" As the wet weather system moves up toward the Midwest, the relatively cool temperatures along the East Coast will give way to more summer-like conditions in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. As temperatures sizzle, fireworks even more risky . Still sweating in the West . But the East Coast warm-up will have nothing on the oppressive heat wave scorching the West Coast. While the Pacific Northwest will get some relief, ""extreme heat will continue across the Western states, especially the Southwest,"" the weather service said. Cities in California, Nevada and Arizona have already suffered through heat topping 120 degrees in the past few days. The heat was so torrid in Idaho that Boise residents could bake cookies without an oven. CNN affiliate KTVB placed a pan of chocolate chip cookie dough on the dashboard of a car. Within a few hours, the cookies were fully baked -- and even overcooked. Forecasters in Las Vegas noted that a similar heat wave in 2005 killed 17 people. They urged neighbors and relatives to check on those most susceptible to heat-related illness -- children, the elderly and the chronically ill. Relief and trouble in Arizona . The extreme heat continues to wreak havoc for firefighters trying to stop Arizona's Yarnell Hill wildfire, which has scorched more than 8,400 acres, about 13 square miles of land. By Wednesday afternoon, the fire was 8% contained. Officials estimated the blaze might not be contained until July 12. The fire killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad on Sunday when fierce, erratic winds whipped flames in different directions. Parched land from Arizona's drought has added fuel to the fire. The possibility of thunderstorms this week could drizzle much needed rain over the fire. But storms could also bring two serious dangers: wind gusts of up to 20 mph and lightning, the suspected cause of the inferno. CNN's Tina Burnside and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Fourth of July will be either hot or wet for two regions of country .

"(CNN) -- Chris Froome retained the yellow jersey on a day of toil and trouble as Ireland's Dan Martin won the ninth stage of the Tour de France. Sky Team rider Froome, who has a one minute and 25 second lead over his closest challenger, was forced to battle on his own as his teammates failed to give him adequate protection. Richie Porte lost his grip on second place overall after finishing more than 17 minutes adrift, while Vasili Kiryienka was swept up by a broom wagon and is unlikely to feature in the remainder of the Tour. There was also misery for Peter Kennaugh, who suffered bruising after falling from his bike -- an incident which left Froome wide open to attack on all fronts. ""This was one of the hardest days I have ever had on the bike,"" Froome told reporters. ""I had no-one else with me. I am really happy I have come through today. I was completely on my own, I had (sporting director) Nicolas Portal in the car telling me not to worry."" Martin, the nephew of great Irish cyclist Stephen Roche, won the long descent to Bagneres-de-Bigorre with Froome following home 20 seconds later in a pack which included rivals Alejandro Valverde and Alberto Contador. Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford revealed his surprise at seeing his team struggle with Porte's failure particularly difficult for him to comprehend. ""That was a bit of a surprise, it is not often we've seen Richie have a day like that,"" Brailsford said. ""He fought for a long time and he wasn't that far back, but eventually you have to think about the future of the race and not just today. ""It was increasingly clear we were going to keep the jersey so there was no need to dig really deep. ""It was better that he sat up and saved himself."" Garmin-Sharp's Martin is the first Irishman to win a stage since Roche won stage 16 of the 1992 Tour in La Bourboule. ""We just wanted to have fun today,"" the 26-year-old told reporters. ""We love racing bikes and making racing exciting for people at home. ""If we win, we win, if we don't, we make a good show.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of travelers have been left in the lurch around the world after the carrier Air Australia went into administration and grounded its fleet Friday. ""It currently appears that there are no funds available to meet operational expenses so flights will be suspended immediately,"" the company said in joint statement Friday with its newly appointed administrators, KordaMentha. About 4,000 passengers in total have been left stranded in Hawaii, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia as a result of the suspension, said Michael Smith, a spokesman for KordaMentha. ""It also appears highly unlikely there will be any flights in the short to medium term,"" the airline's statement said, advising passengers to make alternative arrangements. The airline had sold about 100,000 tickets for future flights, Smith said. With no indication from Air Australia when it might resume operations, those tickets could end up worthless. Some customers may be entitled to refunds, the airline said, depending on how they bought their tickets. But it added that customers without the relevant insurance who paid in cash are unlikely to be eligible for refunds. ""Apparently, the straw that broke camel's back was inability to pay for airline fuel,"" said Michael Ilyine, an accountant from Geelong, Australia. Ilyine and his wife were on their honeymoon in Thailand when they were left stuck at the airport in Phuket, he said, after their Air Australia flight was grounded with their baggage in the hold.

"(CNN) -- Eddy Merckx was known as 'The Cannibal' -- but there's one man who's determined to take a large bite out of his stage victories record. That man is Mark Cavendish -- the man who won Wednesday's fifth stage of the Tour de France and took his tally of wins to 24 to move to within 10 of record holder Merckx. Merckx, a five-time winner of the Tour, won six stages in 1969 and 1972, and eight in 1970 and 1974 during an illustrious career. He achieved the treble feat of winning the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and World Championship Road Race in 1974 -- one of only two men to have done so. But his Tour record is under threat with British rider Cavendish quickly becoming a serious challenger. Cavendish came home just ahead of Team Sky's Edvald Boasson Hagen and Cannodale's Peter Sagan in Wednesday's crash affected race. The Omega-Pharm rider, who won five stages at the Giro d'Italia looked in ominous form, despite suffering from a chest infection. ""I'm still not 100% after being ill last week,"" he told reporters. ""But it's good to get the account open here at the Tour de France. The morale is good in the team and the only way to make it better is by winning more stages."" Australia's Simon Gerrans retained the leader's yellow jersey following the 228.5 kilometer stretch -- the second longest stage of the Tour.

"(CNN) -- Jury questionnaires released Saturday revealed five of the jurors in O.J. Simpson's Las Vegas, Nevada, robbery trial said they disagreed with the 1995 verdict where he was found not guilty of two murders. Jury questionnaires released in O.J. Simpson's robbery trial reveal diverse work and life backgrounds. All 12 jurors had previously heard about Simpson and all but one knew about his acquittal 13 years ago in the Los Angeles, California, stabbing deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. One juror said he agreed that Simpson was not guilty while four said they were unsure. Another said she had ""no feelings. It is history."" One juror did not answer the question. The nine women and three men on the jury said in the questionnaire they would give Simpson, 61, a fair trial on his latest charges. After 13 hours of deliberation Friday, the jurors found Simpson guilty on 12 charges of armed robbery and kidnapping in connection with the 2007 attempted heist of memorabilia he said had been stolen from him. The verdict came 13 years to the day after his acquittal in Los Angeles.  Watch O.J. verdict being read » .

"(CNN) -- Rapid-fire TV news bulletins or getting updates via social-networking tools such as Twitter could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering, scientists say. Scientists say updates on networking tools such as Twitter are often too quick for the brain to fully digest. New findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain's ""moral compass"" to process and could harm young people's emotional development. Before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story, it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest Twitter update, according to a University of Southern California study. ""If things are happening too fast, you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality,"" said researcher Mary Helen Immordino-Yang. The report, published next week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Online Early Edition, studied how volunteers responded to real-life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill, or compassion for physical or social pain. iReport.com: Growing pains for Twitter, Facebook? Brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others, but took longer to show admiration or compassion. ""For some kinds of thought, especially moral decision-making about other people's social and psychological situations, we need to allow for adequate time and refection,"" said Immordio-Yang. She said the study raises questions about the emotional cost, particularly for young people, of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via TV and online feeds such as Twitter. She said: ""We need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind, to produce citizens with a strong moral compass."" USC sociologist Manuel Castells said the study raised more concerns over fast-moving TV than the online environment. ""In a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show, be it in fiction or in infotainment, indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in."" Research leader Antonio Damasio, director of USC's Brain and Creativity Institute, said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news, and highlighted the importance of slow-burn emotions like admiration. Damasio cited the example of U.S. President Barack Obama, who says he was inspired by his father, to show how admiration can be key to cultural success. ""We actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of admiration. It's a deep physiological reaction that's very important to define our humanity."" Twitter, which allows users to swap messages and links of 140-characters or less, says on its Web site that it sees itself as a solution to information overload, rather than a cause of it. This function, It says, ""means you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention.""","USC study says rapid-fire Twitter and news updates are too fast for brain .

"(CNN) -- The British and Irish Lions held on for a 23-21 victory over Australia Saturday in a nail-biting first Test in Brisbane. The opening match of the three-Test series swung on a few key moments and the Wallabies were left to count the cost of two late missed penalties from Kurtley Beale. His first effort from just 30 meters out went wide of the posts and when presented with another chance from a little further out, Beale cruelly slipped as he was making his attempt. It left Warren Gatland's men and the thousands of their supporters who had turned the Suncorp Stadium into a sea of red to celebrate a famous victory. ""It was relief, but we deserved to win that game,"" Gatland told reporters after his side's narrow triumph. They led 13-12 at halftime, despite two tries from Australia wing Israel Folau, who was making a sensational debut just five months after switching to rugby union from rugby league and Australian Rules football. The Lions responded with a superb try of their own through Welshman George North, converted by Leigh Halfpenny, who also made two further penalties to give the tourists the edge. Right wing Alex Cuthbert went over for a second Lions try -- again converted by Halfpenny -- early in the second half -- to leave them 20-12 ahead. James O'Connor and replacement Beale kicked two penalties to give the Wallabies renewed hope, but the ever accurate Halfpenny's boot stretched the lead to 23-18. But after yet another careless infringement by the Lions left Beale with the opportunity to close the gap to just two points after his own surging run led to a penalty. Beale, returning to the Wallabies side, then wasted the two late opportunities to leave his side facing up to defeat. ""It was very frustrating but I'm proud of the effort we put in. It was a trying circumstance to put themselves in a position to win the game,"" Australia coach Robbie Deans said. ""It was a courageous performance that would stack up alongside any but it was disappointing not to get the reward."" His side will take heart from history because the last time the Lions toured Australia in 2001, they won the opening Test at The Gabba, but lost the series 2-1. Next Saturday sees the second Test in Melbourne with the third and final match in Sydney a week later. Meanwhile, world champions New Zealand beat France 24-9 in the the Third Test of their series in New Plymouth. The All Blacks had won the previous two matches and completed a clean sweep.","British and Irish Lions beat Australia in First Test .

"(CNN) -- A passenger who claimed to have a device surgically implanted inside her spurred authorities to divert a North Carolina-bound jetliner to Maine on Tuesday, federal officials said. Doctors aboard US Airways Flight 787 examined the woman and found no sign of recent scars, according to the office of Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. A federal law enforcement source who had been briefed on the matter told CNN the woman would likely receive a psychological evaluation and posed ""basically no threat."" Nevertheless, the Paris-to-Charlotte flight made an unscheduled stop in Bangor ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the Transportation Security Administration said. U.S. fighter jets escorted the plane to the airport, and passengers said the woman was taken off the plane in handcuffs after landing. iReport: Were you there? Share images, video . The Boeing 767 carried 179 passengers and a crew of nine, US Airways spokeswoman Liz Landau told CNN. Andrew Kobayashi, a passenger on the flight, said the woman was sweaty and acting nervous. ""I had briefly noticed her in the back of the plane being a weirdo,"" said Kobayashi, who was seated several rows further forward. A senior federal law enforcement official told CNN that authorities have determined that no bomb was involved in the incident. The woman handed a note to the flight crew indicating that she had had a device implanted in her body, but did not say the device was a bomb or that she was threatening the flight, the official said. While still in the air, the plane's crew told passengers the flight was landing in Bangor because of uncharacteristically strong headwinds that that required the flight to take on more fuel, Kobayashi and other passengers said. But after the jet landed, they said one of the pilots apologized to passengers for the deception. ""He said he normally liked to keep the passengers informed, but the TSA and customs control had ordered him to do this,"" passenger William Milam told CNN. Kobayashi said authorities boarded the plane after landing in Bangor and handcuffed the woman, who appeared to be in her mid-20s to mid-30s. ""I was more bewildered than worried. It was happening very quickly and very quietly,"" he said. iReport: Search dog boards plane . Milam said he had helped the woman stow her carry-on luggage. She had been one of the last passenger to board the flight in Paris, and she was moved to the front of the plane before it took off. ""Then there were announcements that someone was ill, and was there a doctor onboard. It turned out that it was for her,"" he said. The doctor and flight attendants helped her to the back of the plane, where she remained for several hours without incident. King's office said the woman is a Cameroon-born French citizen who was headed to the United States for a 10-day visit. She was traveling alone and had no checked baggage. There was no indication she was on any kind of government watch list, the federal law enforcement source said. CNN's Dana Ford, Lizzie O'Leary, Terry Frieden, Deirdre Walsh, Deborah Feyerick, Chuck Johnston, Bill Mears and Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","NEW: The woman was ""in the back of the plane being a weirdo,"" a passenger tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- When the Supreme Court on Monday sent Fisher v. University of Texas, an affirmative action case, back to the lower court for a second look, supporters of race-conscious policies breathed a sigh of relief. The University of Texas at Austin, which considers race among many other factors to achieve a ""critical mass"" of racial diversity in admissions, was sued by Abigail Fisher, an unsuccessful white applicant. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the university, and many expected the Supreme Court to overturn that ruling and invalidate any use of race in college admissions. Instead, the court remanded the case. The Fisher ruling was not a simple sidestep, however. Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion for a surprisingly large court majority -- seven out of eight voting justices -- re-emphasized a troublesome aspect of previous rulings. When colleges and universities take affirmative steps to ensure that their student bodies include racial diversity that enhances the educational environment for all students, their actions are held to the same strict scrutiny as the admissions requirements that originally barred students of color from many schools in the first place. Opinion: Supreme Court does minorities a favor . Kennedy wrote that the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals did not correctly apply the strict scrutiny standard, which requires that government policy disadvantaging a person based on race must serve a ""compelling governmental interest,"" and the policy must be ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve that interest. The high court ruled in 2003 that achieving diversity in higher education is a compelling interest, in part because diversity can aid the educational environment by bringing different perspectives into the classroom. At stake in Fisher was whether the Texas admissions program was ""narrowly tailored."" Although the court suggested that it was appropriate to defer to the university's judgment that diversity was important, Kennedy wrote that the university receives ""no deference"" on the question of whether its admissions standards are narrowly tailored. Instead, he wrote, courts themselves must compare policies to determine whether ""no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity."" Since it is racial diversity that's at stake, this puts educational institutions in the awkward position of trying to achieve a policy indirectly, since they may only work to foster racial diversity by adopting policies that appear not to involve race at all. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the only dissenter, argued this calls for obfuscation. ""Only an ostrich could regard the supposedly neutral alternatives as race unconscious."" It is the height of irony that the Constitution should be read to require institutions committed to enlightenment to instead practice obfuscation. The court's approach also puts judges in the driver's seat for determining college admissions programs. This leaves the court with an outsized role in setting educational policy. It is troubling to see such a strong judicial footprint in educational policy when there is no reason to believe that white students in Texas lack political power or the ability to be heard when educational policy is made at the state and university level. It was different for African American students, the original beneficiaries of strict scrutiny. They were overtly denied admission at the University of Texas until the 1950s, while Texas also had a long history of race discrimination in voting. In an earlier case, former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested there should come a day when affirmative action programs will not be necessary. As colleges and universities work toward this goal -- redressing disparities that linger after a long history of racial discrimination -- there must also come a day when the Supreme Court stops micromanaging college admissions. The Fisher ruling takes us further from this goal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Dudziak.","Mary Dudziak: Supreme Court's ruling was not a simple sidestep of affirmative action policies .

"(EW.com) -- Thanks to Man of Steel, Fast & Furious 6, Monsters University, and the surprising success of Now You See Me, the box office climbed to record levels in June, earning $1.25 billion — a 19 percent increase over June 2012. This week, Despicable Me 2 and The Lone Ranger, which both begin showing tonight to take advantage of the July 4th holiday weekend, will try to keep the box office firing on all cylinders. The former is poised to dominate the field, but the latter seems unlikely to lasso a big enough audience to justify its gargantuan budget. Here's how I think the box office might shake out over the Wednesday-to-Sunday period: . 1. Despicable Me 2 -- $125 million . The original Despicable Me was a surprise success in 2010, opening with $56 million en route to a $251 million finish. Adults enjoyed the sly edge of the animated feature, and their kids fell in love with the yellow ""minions,"" which became breakout characters in the same vein as Madagascar's penguins or Ice Age's acorn-chasing squirrel, Scrat. For Despicable Me 2, Universal is plastering the minions on any free ad space they can. The studio has inked licensing deals with Wal-Mart, Toys-R-Us, Progressive, Chiquita, Cheetos, McDonalds, and other national brands. Plus, they've got a ""Despicablimp"" flying around the country. But those promotional efforts wouldn't matter all that much if audiences didn't genuinely love the original — and boy did they. In fact, Universal could have a Shrek 2 situation on their hands here — while the original movie became a word-of-mouth smash (Shrek earned $267 million), the sequel could be a slam dunk right out of the gate (Shrek 2 wound up earning $441.3 million.). Despicable Me 2 does face animated competition from Monsters University, which has topped the chart for two weekends, but Despicable Me 2 is fresher in kids' minds, since its predecessor came out just three (not 12) years ago, and it's safe to say there's more built-in excitement for the young franchise. Opening in over 3,900 theaters, Despicable Me 2, which cost Universal and Illumination Entertainment only $76 million to produce, may earn about $130 million over the five-day period. 2. The Lone Ranger -- $58 million . Disney spent at least $225 million on this Gore Verbinski-directed western, which stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer (though many commercials seem to ignore Hammer's presence altogether), but with terrible reviews and a major lack of social media activity, The Lone Ranger looks likely to become an expensive misfire for the studio. Just to earn back its budget domestically, The Lone Ranger will have to earn $40 million more than the highest-grossing western of all time, Dances with Wolves, which took in $184 million in 1990. That seems very, very unlikely. Audiences have just never flocked to desert-set movies the way they have superhero flicks or lush adventures like Depp and Verbinski's Pirates franchise. Recently, western blockbuster Cowboys and Aliens underperformed with a $36.5 million opening and a $100.2 million total against a $163 million budget. That seems like a fair comparison for The Lone Ranger — though Depp's appeal does boost prospects considerably (especially on the international front, where westerns often toil). Tracking suggests that The Lone Ranger could gallop away with about $70 million over five days, but in a marketplace stuffed with well-liked releases, that sounds quite high. Debuting in about 3,700 theaters, The Lone Ranger could wrangle about $58 million in its first five days. For a standard Hollywood release, that result would be just fine. For a $225 million tentpole with bad reviews and limited international appeal — that could spell trouble. 3. Monsters University -- $34 million . The film may fall by about 50 percent due to direct competition from Despicable Me 2, but that still puts it on track for a $23 million three-day weekend — and about $34 million adding in Wednesday and Thursday grosses as well. All told, Monsters University should have nearly $220 million domestically by the time Sunday night rolls around. 4. The Heat -- $32 million . Without any new comedies arriving on the scene, The Heat should continue to play well with adult women in its sophomore frame. The R-rated laugher scored $39.1 million in its debut frame, and it could take in another $32 million over the Wednesday-to-Sunday period, which would give the $43 million Fox film about $82 million after two weekends on the chart. 5. World War Z -- $24 million . Brad Pitt's zombie thriller has been holding up very well on weekdays, but the simple fact that the box office is about to get even more crowded may keep it from notching an exemplary hold. Still, it could score another $24 million in five days, yielding a $156 million gross. Also keep an eye on Kevin Hart: Let Me Explain, which is opening in about 800 theaters on Wednesday. The comedy film, shot during one of Hart's stand-up shows at Madison Square Garden, follows in the footsteps of comedy film Kevin Hart: Laugh At My Pain, which broke out with a $7.7 million total in 2011. Since then, Hart has hosted the MTV Movie Awards, starred in BET's Real Husbands of Hollywood, helped lead Think Like A Man to a $90 million finish, and grown his fanbase substantially. Thus, over the five-day frame, Let Me Explain may take in a very impressive $11 million — not bad considering the film cost only $2.5 million to produce. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The agitated sandwich shop customer disliked the pickles. Now she's in one with the cops. A Massachusetts woman who ordered a steak-and-cheese sub at a subway station was so angry about ""too many pickles"" on her sandwich that she punched an employee and shoved two jars of pickles at her, transit police said Monday. The jars shattered and the customer fled -- without the sandwich -- but the brine-covered employee managed to catch up with her and hold her until transit and local police arrived, according to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Police, who said they plan to file assault charges against her. The incident happened Saturday at the Nathan's Famous Hot Dogs at the Quincy subway station, the transit police said. After Tina Drouin, 49, ordered the sub, she immediately complained the employee was ""putting too much s***"" on the sandwich and shouted ""other derogatory comments regarding the preparation of the steak and cheese,"" police said. ""It appeared the Nathan's employee could simply not please Drouin,"" they said. Drouin demanded a refund, and when the employee told her she couldn't get one, Drouin punched the woman in the face and then pushed large jars of pickles on her, knocking her to the ground, police said. ""Drouin fled from the station, however the sub maker determined not to let Drouin escape justice gave pursuit catching up to her"" and held her until police arrived. CNN could not reach Drouin immediately for comment. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","A customer complained of too many pickles on her steak-and-cheese sub .

"(CNN) -- A painting by pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, which has not been seen in public for more than 30 years, and a massive pearl once owned by Mary Tudor have been unveiled as the highlights of London's Masterpiece art fair. The artwork, ""Puzzle Portrait,"" was created by Lichtenstein (1923-1997) in 1978, before being sold directly to its current owner, who kept it out of the public eye for decades. The super-sized pearl, which weighs 64.5 carats (258.12 grains), once belonged to England's Mary I (1516-1558). The monarch was painted wearing it in several portraits, now in the Prado in Madrid and the National Portrait Gallery in London. ""It is a true natural masterpiece,"" said Nazy Vassegh, the event's CEO. ""It is one of the world's largest natural pearls, and on top of that it has royal provenance. Pearls of this heritage are very rare. It is part of history."" The jewel disappeared in the late 16th century, and was missing for hundreds of years, before being rediscovered in 2004; following extensive research, it has only recently been identified as the Mary Tudor pearl. Interactive: Rembrandt's 'Night Watch' explained . Organizers of the fair say the pearl and the pop art are likely to be among the most sought-after pieces for sale at Masterpiece 2013. The only fair of its kind taking place at the height of London's arts and social season, the show is held in a purpose-built pavilion in the grounds of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea. Held annually since 2010, Masterpiece offers shoppers and curious visitors the chance to get up close to -- and even take home -- museum-quality art and artifacts. More than 160 dealers, galleries and workshops will display antique furniture and classic cars, precious jewelery, ancient sculptures and contemporary video installations. ""The idea is that there is a bit of everything, but that it is all pretty special,"" explained Vassegh. ""We have works from the 6th century B.C. and even earlier, right through to a Bill Viola, and everything is of an extremely high quality."" Each work has been vetted by one of 26 committees of experts, to ensure the highest standards across disciplines, and some of the biggest names in art, from Albrecht Duerer and Nicholas Hilliard to Pablo Picasso and Joan Miro will be on view.

"Ankara, Turkey (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people gathered across Turkey on Tuesday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Madimak Massacre, in which 37 people, mostly members of the Alevi sect, were killed when an angry mob set fire to their hotel. The largest memorial took place in the central Anatolian province of Sivas, the scene of the July 2, 1993, massacre. Demonstrators carried photographs of the victims and chanted, ""Murderers will answer for their crime."" ""We have not forgotten and we will not let it be forgotten,"" they said. Most of those killed in the inferno were Alevis, members of a Muslim sect that combines traditional Shiite doctrine with Anatolian Sufi practices. They were attending a conference at the Madimak Hotel when the mob set fire to the building. At least 37 people died, 33 of them conference attendees. Two hotel workers and two others implicated in the arson also died. There were 125 suspects who went on trial in 1993 for the massacre; 85 of them were sentenced the next year, and the rest were released. A higher court overturned the verdict. In 1997, suspects were tried again, and 33 were convicted and sentenced to the death penalty; another 14 were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. The death sentences were commuted to life in prison when Turkey abolished capital punishment in 2002. As many as eight suspects are still wanted by the Turkish government for the crime. Thousands of people gathered Tuesday in the Turkish capital of Ankara to commemorate the massacre, with a small group later marching to Kizilay Square, where Alevi demonstrator Ethem Sarisuluk was killed, allegedly by a police bullet, at the height of anti-government protests that began in late May. Demonstrators held a moment of silence to remember the Madimak victims, then lit candles and placed flowers where Sarisuluk was shot. Security forces stood by with water cannon during the demonstration. ""We weren't expecting the police to let us march here,"" said demonstrator Burhan Coban, 26. ""But we wanted to commemorate the 20th-year anniversary of the Sivas Massacre here where Ethem was killed."" In Istanbul, the commemorations were organized by various Alevi groups, labor unions and the Taksim Solidarity Platform, an umbrella organization that launched the anti-government protests in late May and early June at the city's Gezi Park. The Turkish government blames the protests on an unknown foreign conspiracy, with one deputy prime minister pointing to the Jewish diaspora. ""There are those inside and outside the country who are jealous and envious of Turkey's growth,"" Besir Atalay, a deputy prime minister, told reporters Monday on camera. ""They are all uniting. On the one side, the Jewish diaspora. You have seen the foreign media's attitude over the events of Gezi Park. How quickly they bought it and how quickly and widely they started broadcasting before any evaluation."" The Chief Rabbinate of Turkey and the Turkish Jewish Community issued a statement of concern Tuesday about the remarks and said they are trying to get more details. ""But in any case, based on the fact that Turkish Jewish citizens as well as other Jewish people living all around the globe may be affected and pointed as a target of such a generalization, we wish to express our concerns, and share our apprehension and worry of the consequences that such perceptions can cause,"" the statement said. Atalay's office said the comments were taken out of context, according to the semi-official Anatolian news agency. ""In the speech, there was no intention, no signal, or expression aimed at our Jewish citizens in Turkey or Jewish people in other countries,"" Atalay's office said in a statement.","The Madimak Massacre happened on July 2, 1993 .

"London (CNN) -- Henry V rallies his troops in William Shakespeare's play of the same name before the Battle of Agincourt with these words: ""Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more... When the blast of war blows in our ears then initiate the action of the tiger. Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood."" King Henry's call to action is cited as one of the most motivational speeches in history, and the British Army would no doubt have hoped for similarly inspiring words and good PR from his namesake descendant, Prince Harry, in interviews timed to coincide with his departure from Afghanistan. But as the prince recalled the ""taste of blood"" in his mouth as he waited to attack Taliban insurgents from his helicopter gunship, his comments appear to have stirred up as much mockery and controversy as sympathy. Prince Harry on Afghan mission: 'Take a life to save a life' The third-in-line to the British throne, known in the military as Captain Wales, also compared having his finger on the trigger of rockets, missiles and a 30mm cannon to playing video games. ""It's a joy for me. I am one of those people who loves playing Playstation and XBox and so I am good with my thumbs, I like to think that I am quite useful."" In Afghanistan, the media-savvy Taliban seized on the remarks and called Harry a ""coward"" for only speaking when he was out of danger. ""This prince comes and compares this war with his games, PlayStation or whatever he calls it,"" Zabihullah Mujahid told the Daily Telegraph. ""To describe the war in Afghanistan as a game demeans anyone -- especially a prince, who is supposed to be made of better things."" Even an Afghan parliamentarian admitted Harry's comments could risk damaging relations. Sharifullah Kamawal told the newspaper: ""This makes the withdrawal process much faster, because for now half of the people say the foreign forces must stay for longer, but if they say these kind of things then more people will want them to go home."" Prince Harry also appeared to acknowledge that he killed insurgents on his four-month tour of duty in Helmand Province. He said it was sometimes justified to ""take a life to save a life. That's what we revolve around, I suppose."" ""Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them, then we will do it."" The comments set social media alight, with comments both in favour and critical of the prince. The British tabloids also splashed the story about him across their front pages: The Sun's headline was: ""Harry kills Taliban chief: Hero prince in missile strike on commander"" In Britain, the Stop the War Coalition criticized the 28-year-old's comments as ""crass"" and questioned how he knew those he'd killed were actually members of the Taliban. ""In recent months many civilians have been killed by air strikes. This arrogant and insensitive attitude to killing Afghans, whoever they are, is hardly likely to win hearts and minds -- a supposed aim of the war,"" said the group's convener Lindsey German. In the Guardian, one commentator mocked Harry's language. ""This is Captain Wales's new incarnation: Killer Captain!"" wrote Hadley Freeman. Referring to the occasion when Harry was photographed naked in a Las Vegas hotel room, Freeman added: ""During his deployment in 2007-08, Captain Wales spoke of his frustration at not being able to partake in actual action. No more! Now he drops gung-ho aphorisms like Dick Cheney (""Take a life to save a life"") and the young chap who only months before was photographed with his fingers in the most curious of places during a game of ""strip billiards"" in Las Vegas has since placed those same fingers ""on the triggers of deadly rockets, missiles and a 30mm cannon."" While many analysts in Britain praised Harry for risking his life to support ground troops in Helmand, one politician questioned the tone of his remarks. Opposition defense spokesman Jim Murphy said: ""I'm not going to second guess whether he should or shouldn't have said it. ""He's obviously a young and brave man. He was candid. Perhaps he may have been more candid than the Palace may have wished."" In the interviews, Harry said he relished the relative freedom -- largely away from the scrutiny of the world's media -- that serving in the military offered him. ""It's very easy to completely forget about who I am when I am in the army,"" he told reporters. But he added that he would prefer to have been serving on the ground than as an airman based at Camp Bastion along with 4,000 other British service personnel. ""My choice would have been back out on the ground with my regiment,"" he said. ""For me it's not that normal because I go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp, and that's one thing that I dislike about being here. Which is probably another reason why I'd love to be out in the PBs [patrol bases], away from it all."" In his interviews the prince makes little attempt at all to hide his antipathy towards the media and the tabloids in particular. ""Everyone's guilty for buying the papers...though hopefully no one believes what they read."" But after reading the criticism of his own comments, he may want to reflect on another famous line from Shakespeare's ""Henry V"": ""Men of few words are the best men.""","Prince Harry's comments about Afghanistan stir up mockery, controversy -- and sympathy .

"(CNN) -- Two American citizens serving long prison sentences for treason in Gambia will return to the United States Tuesday night after the Rev. Jesse Jackson made a face-to-face appeal for their release to President Yahya Jammeh. In a separate concession, Jammeh agreed to halt indefinitely dozens of executions he had originally planned to carry out by mid September, according to Jackson's non-profit Rainbow Push Coalition. The tiny West African nation last executed an inmate about 30 years ago, but in August the president announced he would have all death row prisoners put to death -- 47 in total. The pronouncement sparked the outrage of human rights activists around the world and was the catalyst for Jackson's trip ""to plead for mercy."" The freed Americans were not on death row. One of them, Amadou Scattred Janneh, was serving a life sentence for printing and distributing T-shirts critical of Jammeh, according to Amnesty International. The T-shirts bore the slogan ""End Dictatorship Now."" Janneh once served as Gambia's minister of information, and also taught at the University of Tennessee. The second man, Tamsir Jasseh, who served in the U.S. military during Operation Desert Storm, was serving a 20-year sentence for his role in a failed coup against the president. Jackson traveled to Gambia as a private citizen on a trip sponsored by the Gambian government, which covered his flights and accommodations, said U.S. Ambassador to Gambia Edward Alford. The U.S. Embassy was not involved in the negotiations. Gambia, a former British colony surrounded by Senegal, has a population of 1.3 million. Jammeh took power in a military coup in 1994, and was elected president two years later. The government represses political opposition groups, and the president has won all elections since he came to power. The nation imposes capital punishment for various crimes, including murder and treason, the latter commonly used to stifle dissent in some African nations. The country does not adhere to international standards on fair trials, according to said Audrey Gaughran, the Africa director for Amnesty International. Until this year, none of the executions had been carried out, although Jammeh made a threat to do so in 2009. But in August, after Jammeh announced he would enforce the executions, nine inmates were killed by firing squad. That left 38, whose lives have been spared after the Gambian president's moratorium on executions was announced during Jackson's visit. Gambia's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since Jammeh's election, but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure. CNN's Jack Maddox contributed to this report .","Jesse Jackson appeals directly to Gambia's president for the release .

"(CNN) -- Triple world champion Sebastian Vettel has told Formula One drivers who feel unsafe behind the wheel to stay out of the cockpit as the Red Bull driver weighed in on the ongoing tire row. The Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA) issued a statement Thursday to ""express their deepest concerns"" after five drivers at last weekend's Brtiish Grand Prix, including Mercedes' race leader Lewis Hamilton, experienced high-speed tire blowouts. The GPDA has threatened to boycott Sunday's German Grand Prix should a repeat of last weekend's Silverstone race occur, with tire supplier Pirelli responding by modifying its tires with a Kevlar strip to prevent punctures. CNN's F1 Interactive: German Grand Prix . Germany's Vettel, a world champion in each of the last three years, says it is up to each driver to decide whether they feel comfortable in the cockpit. ""At the end of the day it is an individual decision for each driver about whether you think that it is safe or not,"" the 26-year-old told Formula One's official website. ""If you feel that the risk is too high, then you should not get into the car. For sure I think that no one could have predicted the Silverstone race to develop like it did, so there is nobody to blame for that. ""The good thing from it was that right after the Silverstone race many people sat together and were looking for a constructive solution, and we arrived here in Germany with a different set of rear tires. ""It was a positive surprise to see that given that small window of time, Pirelli was able to bring a different component, and now we have to see if it works. ""So I think it is very positive that they took the criticism seriously and just decided to make some changes."" Sunday's race represents a home grand prix for Vettel, who celebrated his 26th birthday earlier this week. ""Seeing all the fans that support us German drivers gives me a great feeling,"" added Vettel, who leads the 2013 drivers' standings by 21 points from Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. ""It is a true privilege to have a home grand prix at all. ""I can still remember coming here and seeing all the Michael Schumacher fans at a time when I wasn't even dreaming of being in Formula One."" ""We are very confident that we could win here, but we shall not underestimate our competitors. ""We are not putting ourselves under too much pressure though, as there is no way of forcing a win here or indeed anywhere else."" Elsewhere in motorsport, it was announced that Argentina will host a round of the MotoGP world championships for the first time since 1999.

"London (CNN) -- Four months holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London has been ""a little like living in a space station"" but beats prison, fugitive WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said Thursday. Assange sought refuge in the embassy in June, after losing a court battle against extradition to Sweden. Since then, he has been living in a single room with a frosted-glass window while the business of the diplomatic mission goes on around him. ""It's a little like living in a space station, because there's no natural light and you've got to make all your own stuff. You can't go out to shops and so on,"" Assange told CNN in an interview Thursday. ""But I have been in solitary confinement. I know what life is like for prisoners. It's a lot better than it is for prisoners."" Embassy staffers would not allow CNN to view his living quarters, but Assange appeared relaxed and healthy despite his restricted circumstances. His comments came the same day WikiLeaks began disclosing a new round of U.S. military documents dealing with handling prisoners in American military custody. Though the first of the newly published documents include no bombshells, Assange said the records his group will put out are ""documents of incredible historical importance"" and demonstrate a ""climate of unaccountability"" within the U.S. government. Lady Gaga visits Assange in London . Ecuador granted Assange asylum in August, amid a diplomatic row between the United Kingdom and his South American hosts. British courts have approved his extradition to Sweden, and Assange faces arrest if he sets foot outside the embassy. Assange has not been charged with a crime, but Sweden has said it wants to question him about allegations that he sexually assaulted a woman there. Assange has denied the allegations and says they're a ruse to get him to Sweden, which would then extradite him to the United States. A U.S. Army intelligence analyst, Pfc. Bradley Manning, is currently awaiting trial on charges that he leaked hundreds of thousands of classified military and State Department documents while serving in Iraq. Many of those documents ended up on the WikiLeaks website, and Manning could be sentenced to life in prison if found guilty. Assange said his standoff could end if the United States dropped its investigation of WikiLeaks. ""It's an immoral investigation,"" he said. ""It breaches the First Amendment, it breaches all the principles that the U.S. government says it stands for and it absolutely breaches the principles the Founding Fathers stood for and which most of the U.S. people believe in.""

"(CNN) -- Police in New York have arrested a man in connection with a weekend shooting at a Brooklyn house party that left nine people hospitalized. Tyrone Brown, 24, was charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment, police said Tuesday. The shooting started early Sunday in the East Flatbush neighborhood, police said. A neighbor told CNN affiliate WCBS that she heard gunshots. Four men and five women, all younger than 45, were injured and taken to four hospitals. The injuries were not life-threatening, New York Police Department Officer Sophia Tassy-Mason said. The neighborhood at East 52nd Street is a mix of residential and commercial buildings, she said. According to NYPD statistics, there have been 21 shooting incidents reported in the area this year.

"(CNN) -- Sabine Lisicki survived another emotional roller coaster to claim her place in the women's singles final at Wimbledon with a thrilling three-set victory over fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska Thursday. The 23rd seed from Germany will play Marion Bartoli of France Saturday, the winners progressing to the title match by vastly contrasting routes. 15th seed Bartoli took little over an hour to end the dream run of Belgian Kirsten Flipkens 6-1 6-2 in the first semifinal. Lisicki, who caused the upset of all upsets when she dispatched defending champion Serena Williams on Monday, was again taken the full distance by Radwanska before winning 4-6 2-6 9-7 in two hours 18 minutes of compelling action on Centre Court. Like in her match against No.1 seed Williams, Lisicki trailed by a break in the decider and looked to be heading for the exit door until summoning up a stirring comeback. ""In the third set I was down 3-0 and I thought 'I did it against Serena, I can do it again,"" she told BBC Sport. ""It was unbelievable, I think the last few games were so exciting. It was a battle and I'm just so happy to have won it,"" she added. Radwanska, beaten by Williams in last year's final, appeared to have taken a stranglehold on the match when she recovered from an early break down in the second set to win eight of the next nine games. But the 23-year-old Lisicki, who has become an instant crowd favorite at SW19, battled back to serve for the match at 5-4, only to be broken again. Radwanska kept on the pressure to force Lisicki to hold her own service twice to stay in the championship but in the 15th game fell behind again. Serving for a place in the final for the second time, Lisicki held her nerve and took it on her second match point before falling to the turf in trademark celebration. Bartoli, who revealed after her victory that she had taken a half hour nap shortly before coming out for one of the most important matches of her career, emerged from her slumbers to dismiss 20th seed Flipkens. Looking to follow in the footsteps of famous compatriots such as Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin, Flipkens looked nervous and tentative from the start and could not repeat the form which had seen her knock out 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. ""I was asleep from 12 until 1230, you can ask the physio,"" Bartoli said. ""And I was still razor-sharp right from the start."" She put out Henin in the 2007 semifinals before going on to lose in straight sets to Venus Williams and will be looking to go one better against Lisicki, who is appearing in her first grand slam final. Lisicki will bid to become the first German to win a major since Steffi Graf in the 1999 French Open. She revealed that Graf had sent her a good luck text ahead of her semifinal against Radwanska. In other Wimbledon action Thursday, top seeds Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan of the United States beat Rohan Bopanna (India) and Edouard Roger-Vasselin of France 6-7 6-4 6-3 5-7 6-3 to reach the final of the men's doubles. The Bryans will play the Croatian-Brazil pair of Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo after they beat the Indian and Czech combination of Leander Paes and Radek Stepanek, also in five sets.","Sabine Lisicki to play Marion Bartoli in Wimbledon singles final .

"(CNN) -- Today's soccer professionals have a battery of physios, fitness trainers and doctors all striving to fine-tune their players' physique for optimum performance. But are football clubs missing a trick in overlooking dedicated training for the most important organ of all -- the brain? Scientists at London's Brunel University believe the game's top talents, such as Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, have mental faculties that are better programmed to anticipate their opponents' moves. Research published in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology found that of 39 players tested, the more experienced footballers were able to suppress the urge to act instinctively, making them less susceptible to feints or tricks from their opponents. Brunel's study reinforces the view held by one of the greatest players of all time -- Johan Cruyff, who said that football is a game you play with your brain -- and offers tantalizing prospects for clubs. Neural activity . Should they be able to unpick the best way to condition the brain's ability to anticipate an opponent's trickery, it could lead to better players and a potential stampede as clubs rush to add a neuroscientist to their back-room teams. ""I can see top teams employing neuroscientists in the future,"" Dr. Dan Bishop from Brunel's Center for Sports Medicine and Human Performance told CNN. ""That's because we have the skills and resources to witness very subtle changes in perceptual abilities that may not initially manifest in performance data, because people can change their mind midway through a task and therefore give an erroneous response, when in fact their initial 'preattentive' brain response was the correct one. ""I imagine that this will be most useful at academy level, to assess the development of young players."" Bishop believes the findings could help nurture a new generation of young sports stars in Britain, which is seeking to capitalize on a potential increase in participation following the London 2012 Olympics. ""We believe this greater level of neural activity is something that can be developed through high-quality training, so the next step will be to look at how the brain can be trained over time to anticipate the moves of opponents,"" he said. ""Particularly following on from the Olympics, with more people being encouraged to take up sport, we hope that our findings can be used to refine and speed up training techniques to nurture the potential in budding young sports stars."" During the trial, players ranging from novices to semiprofessionals were placed in an MRI scanner and shown video clips of a player dribbling towards them. They then had to decide in which direction to move in order to tackle them. The study found the better players were more sensitive to moves and tricks by an opponent than those at the less talented end of the scale, which came as no surprise to Bishop. ""I am confident the findings would be even stronger with professional players,"" he said. ""Much of the activation we saw was comparable to the activations we had witnessed in our previous studies of badminton players -- which included a large number of international athletes."" Neurological track . There is growing group of coaches who need no convincing of the power of the brain in developing top players. One of them is Kevin McGreskin, technical director at Soccer Eye Q -- a company that specializes in elite performance coaching. ""I think that coaches either forget, or don't even realize, that football is a hugely cognitive sport,"" he said in an interview with football magazine The Blizzard. ""We've got to develop the players' brains as well as their bodies but it's much easier to see and measure the differences we make to a player's physiology than we can with their cognitive attributes."" His views are shared by Michel Bruyninckx, formerly academy director for Belgian club Standard Liege and now at Qatar's Aspire Academy, who is something of a pioneer when it comes to brain training in soccer players. He places huge value on ""brain-centered learning"" and devised a specific program designed to foster improvement in a young player's cognitive skills. Bruyninckx places the same level of importance of neuroscience as he does football tactics. Both Bruyninckx and McGreskin have embraced ""overload"" drills to help tune players' brains, where some might be asked to speak in different languages during fitness training while others are asked to toss a tennis ball around and call out colors during sessions involving the football. ""We need to develop an engram -- a neurological track -- in the brain,"" Bruyninckx told The Blizzard. ""We always thought that sporting activities were mechanical activities, but we know that there are interventions from the brain."" Bruyninckx's work has been acknowledged by one of the world's top soccer coaches, Jose Mourinho, the current manager at Real Madrid who has won titles in four different countries and lifted the European Champions League twice. ""Mourinho immediately understood what I'm trying to do and he asked a lot of intelligent questions,"" said Bruyninckx. ""He also noticed that the organization of the drills requires a greater team involvement, more concentration, attention, a continuous inciting of perception and that intelligent playing could grow a lot.""","Research shows that soccer's best players have brains that are better attuned to the game .

"Phnom Penh (CNN) -- More than 20 striking garment workers were injured this week, including two pregnant women, during clashes with police outside a factory in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia, a labor leader said. Roughly 4,000 workers have walked off the job at a factory owned by Sabrina (Cambodia) Garment Manufacturing, which supplies Nike and Lululemon Athletica. They are demanding a $14 monthly increase, from the $74 they make now, said Say Sokmy, secretary-general of the Free Trade Union of Workers of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Police used stun batons to disperse strikers on Monday, she said, injured more than twenty. Both Nike and Lululemon released statements, expressing concern about the incident. ""As outlined in Nike's Code of Conduct, Nike requires its contract manufacturers to respect their employees' rights to freedom of association,"" the U.S.-based company said in a statement. It continued: ""Workers are employed by the contract factories, not by Nike, and wages and compensation are the responsibility of the factories. It is our understanding that this factory raised its own minimum wage on May 1 and pays above the country's minimum wage."" Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica said its sustainability teams are monitoring events and are in daily contact with the factory to ensure workers' safety. ""We require all of our vendors to uphold and respect the workers' rights around the freedom of association and collective bargaining as stated in our lululemon Code of Ethics,"" said Therese Hayes, vice president of sustainability. ""The current situation deeply concerns us and we will continue to be in close contact with our factory partner, and take any immediate actions if necessary."" Both companies stressed that the factory is part of Better Factories Cambodia (BFC), a program established by the International Labor Organization to monitor workplaces and offer advice. According to BFC, the garment industry employs some 400,000 workers and accounts for $4 billion, or roughly 80%, of Cambodia's total export revenue. Most of what's made is exported to the European Union and the United States. READ MORE: Inside a Bangladesh garment factory that plays by the rules . OPINION: Stop cashing in on Bangladeshi workers .

"(CNN) -- In a tournament which has produced so many shocks perhaps the only surprise is that it took Andy Murray so long to put his legions of fans through the mill. As Britain paused, skipped its afternoon tea and instead munched nonchalantly on strawberries and cream, Murray threatened to sour an afternoon which had promised so much. The stage was set -- gone were the usual suspects. There was no Roger Federer, no Rafael Nadal. This was Murray's moment. But somebody forgot to tell Fernando Verdasco - the man who had the audacity to threaten the home favorite's apparently seamless stroll to the final. Two sets down and staring elimination in the face, Murray produced when it mattered. The World No.2 rallied in heroic fashion to win 4-6 3-6 6-1 6-4 7-5 and seal his place in the semifinal of Wimbledon for the fifth time in his career. ""There's been a lot of matches where I've been behind and managed to turn it round,"" Murray told the BBC. ""I don't know if it is the most emotional match, but it was an unbelievable atmosphere and great to get through. ""Fernando served unbelievably well especially when he was behind. In the first set he played some really good stuff, in the second set my level dropped and I started rushing a bit. ""i managed to turn it around. I made some poor choices. He's a very, very good player he's been at the top of the game before and he's playing well again. ""I started to play more solid and really took my time when I had the chance."" Tears . Last year, Murray stood on the Centre Court at Wimbledon and captured the hearts of a nation as he cried through a speech just minutes after his final defeat by Federer. Weeks later, he exorcised that ghost, defeating Federer on the same court to win Olympic gold and give himself the perfect preparation going into the U.S. Open. Murray's heroic victory over Novak Djokovic in New York ended Britain's 76-year wait for a grand slam champion as he finally equaled the achievements of Fred Perry. Defeat in the final of the Australian Open deprived him of a second slam, while injury prevented him from competing at Roland Garros. Not since Perry triumphed in 1936 has the home crowd saluted one of its own -- but Verdasco appeared disinterested by such sentiment. The Spaniard, currently the ninth best player in his own country, had never made it past the fourth round of Wimbledon before this year. Ranked 54 in the world, the left-hander was supposed to merely turn up and succumb to the inevitable. But this Wimbledon tournament has refused to conform with normality -- Nadal, Federer, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova will tell you that. Instead, it was Verdasco who took the contest to Murray, swinging with his prodigious forehand which left the Briton chasing hopelessly across court. The 29-year-old took the opening set 6-4 to leave Murray cursing his luck and silence a partisan crowd. While the vocal support roared Murray back to the baseline, it was Verdasco who was making all the noise. Once again he left Murray questioning his game as he hit winner after winner to claim the second set 6-3 and leave his opponent teetering on the edge. Blinked . But then Verdasco blinked. From being in control of the contest, Verdasco squandered the initiative and allowed Murray to waltz to the third set 6-1. Suddenly the impetus was with the home favorite and backed by the majority of the 10,000 crowd and countless others on 'Murray Mound', he roared back into the contest. Whereas an hour earlier it was Murray looking at the sky, this time it was Verdasco who was left with more questions than answers. Now it was Murray's turn to dominate, showing that extra level of fitness and rapid cross-court speed as he leveled the match by taking the fourth set 6-4. Having won 14 of his 20 contests which have gone to five sets, Murray would have been confident of pulling off the great escape. Verdasco proved a stubborn opponent, holding serve with relative ease to take the match to 5-5 in the decider. But in the 11th game, Murray finally made the breakthrough, taking a 6-5 lead before serving for the match which he did with aplomb. Janowicz . Murray will play Poland's Jerzy Janowicz in the last four after the 24th seed saw off fellow Pole Lukasz Kubot. Janowicz hit 30 aces and 58 winners on the way to becoming his country's first ever male grand slam semifinalist. ""Really I have not many words to say right now,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm just really happy and it doesn't matter if I'm the first or second from Poland."" Earlier, six-time grand slam winner Djokovic swatted aside Tomas Berdych 7-6 6-4 6-3 to make it through to the semifinal stage. The Serb star, who defeated Nadal in the 2011 final, will play Argentina' s Juan Martin del Potro in the last four. Djokovic, who has now reached 13 consecutive Grand slam semifinals, avenged his 2010 defeat by Berdych -- a contest which propelled the Czech into the final on that occasion. The 26-year-old was 3-0 down in the second set but wrestled back control of the match before seeing off his disheartened opponent. ""It was a close match -- it could have gone either way,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""He was a double-break up in the second set. I don't know how I got out of that, but I was serving and returning well. ""I have a commitment to go far in this tournament. I am playing some of my best tennis on grass even though it's not my preferred surface,"" World No.6 Berdych revealed his disappointment after his performance tailed off following a promising opening set and a half. He said: ""I can play better than I played today. If you give him too much then it's a lot."" Del Potro . Meanwhile, del Potro overcame an injury to his left knee to ease past World No.4 David Ferrer 6-2 6-4 7-6. The Argentine hit 42 winners and 12 aces after slipping on the Centre Court surface early on during the last eight clash. Del Potro, who had not reached the semifinal of a grand slam since winning the U.S. Open four years ago, is the second Argentine to reach the last four following David Nalbandian in 2002. ""I was really close,"" del Potro told reporters after being asked how close he was from retiring. ""I felt a lot of pain at the beginning of the match. It was exactly the same as before. ""It's really, really painful. I twisted my knee once again, but the doctor gave me some magic pills so I could finish the match. I'm so glad to go through."" Ferrer had problems of his own, revealing he was struggling with an ankle injury. ""I wasn't able to warm-up properly but it was fine during the match,"" he told reporters. ""I don't think his injury affected him. He was more focused and aggressive, served really well and deserved to win.""","Andy Murray wins epic five set thriller against Fernando Verdasco .

"(CNN) -- Seventy eight years after Gene Sarazen's albatross at The Masters became golf's ""shot heard around the world"" football has its own version, except there was no glory in Eden Hazard's kick heard all over the globe. And it has left another dent in the sport's battered image. When Sarazen holed his second shot, over water at the par-five 15th, it helped him win the Augusta title and launch the tournament's global appeal. In 1935, the news of Sarazen's achievement would have traveled far slower than the seconds it took Hazard's moment of madness to become a social media talking point across the planet. Chelsea were trailing in their League Cup, generally regarded as the third competition in English soccer, semifinal second leg in Swansea, with less than 15 minutes remaining. The ball went out of play and, when a ball boy took his time retrieving it, Hazard went to fetch it himself. When the boy fell on the ball, the player tried to kick it out from under him and was sent off for violent conduct. More astonishing than the incident itself was the debate about whether or not Hazard had done anything wrong. Many people tried to defend the Belgian international. Let's quickly put that to bed. The 17-year-old ball boy was a child, a volunteer helping out at a professional football match, and he was kicked by an adult player. Hazard was wrong. Now, that's not the same as saying there were no mitigating circumstances because there were. The ball boy later admitted he was wasting time and that was clear to see at the time. Hazard was anxious to resume play with Chelsea's place in the competition under threat. He aimed his kick at the ball not the person. The teenager isn't a young child and wasn't badly injured. Those are the only reasons why Hazard isn't facing the same nine-month ban given to Manchester United icon Eric Cantona who famously launched himself at an abusive fan with a kung fu-style kick in 1995. Cantona's assault was deliberate and intended to harm whereas Hazard was merely trying to get the ball back. However, Cantona attacked another adult and after severe provocation. Hazard's impatience led to him kicking a minor and if the child had been seriously hurt the police would be investigating. Chelsea inflamed the situation when the club's official Twitter account immediately defended the player, asking ""Has football gone mad?"" before later removing the tweet and apologizing. Well, maybe it has but only because mega rich clubs seem to have lost touch with reality and give the impression they don't need to follow the rules of common decency that the rest of us try to live by. What is a shame for the London team is that any adulation and respect which stemmed from their fairy tale European Champions League triumph last season has disappeared because of the defensive way they have reacted to criticism since then. Chelsea's handling of the John Terry racism case and the accusations aimed at referee Mark Clattenburg was poor. A possible persecution complex appears to be a culture at the club. The Terry and Clattenburg incidents happened before Rafael Benitez's arrival and yet the new manager has adopted the same mindset. When a simple apology and show of humility would have killed the controversy, a complaint about a ""Big Brother society"" perpetuates the impression that Chelsea will only ever point fingers and never accept blame. In this case, good sense did eventually prevail with reports claiming the boy was taken to Chelsea's dressing room, warmly greeted and he exchanged apologies with Hazard. South Wales police have confirmed they are not pursuing the matter.","Eden Hazard sent of on Wednesday for kicking a ball boy .

"Washington (CNN) -- Pentagon budget cuts will severely reduce U.S. military efforts to stop the illegal trafficking of drugs and people into the United States from South and Central America, according to the top American commander in that region. Gen. John Kelly, head of the U.S. Southern Command, said mandatory budget cuts to the Defense Department will cut the number of ships that patrol the waters of the Caribbean and Pacific along Latin America, traditional trafficking routes into the United States. Kelly on Wednesday said that Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships seized between 150 to 200 tons of cocaine during drug interdiction operations last year. Senate approves bill to prevent government shutdown . He told a Senate panel that the budget cuts could wipe out those successes. ""Next year all of that (drugs) will make its way ashore and into the United States,"" Gen. Kelly said. ""Navy ops in my area of operations will essentially stop -- go to zero, I believe,"" Kelly said of the sequestration cuts. ""With a little luck we might see a Coast Guard cutter down there, but we're gonna lose airborne ISR (aircraft surveillance) in the counter-drug fight, we'll lose the Navy assets,"" he said. Kelly said he worries the sophisticated network that moves the drugs and people into the Unites States would also open up. ""We watch individuals come into the network from as far away as the Middle East,"" Kelly said. He cited examples of individuals from Pakistan and Iran paying a lot of money to take advantage of the complicated network and quietly slip into the United States. ""Whatever they're up to, they're not coming here to drive a cab in Washington, D.C. and they're paying a lot of money to get here,"" he said. Kelly would not elaborate what these people did when they reached the United States. Under the mandatory budget cuts, the Pentagon's share of cuts would be $500 billion -- about half the government total -- over the next decade. Between now and September, the Pentagon must slash about $50 billion across the board, with little ability to move money between accounts. Kelly said Colombia used to be the top cocaine producing country in the region, but has fallen to number three behind Peru and Bolivia, and as much as 20% of the cocaine moving through South America ends up in the United States. He said large amounts of drugs also travel through Brazil and are moved to Africa -- providing funding for insurgents and drug traffickers -- and then up into Europe. But as the United States and partner countries have solved much of the ship and fast-boat systems used move drugs, traffickers have invented more sophisticated submarine-like vehicles with even longer range and the ability to hold up to 10 tons of cocaine. The new generation of subs are able to elude sea and land surveillance much more easily, according to Kelly.","General testifies before Senate committee .

"(CNN) -- When James Huberty walked into a McDonald's restaurant 25 years ago this month, he knew he was going to kill somebody. He probably didn't know his murderous rampage would change how police departments work. Police help a wounded customer out of a California McDonald's where a man killed 21 people in 1984. At 3:40 p.m. on July 18, 1984, Huberty carried a long-barreled Uzi, a pump-action shotgun and a handgun into a McDonald's in San Ysidro, an enclave of San Diego, California. Witnesses said the unemployed welder and security guard started shooting immediately, and kept on shooting for 77 minutes until a police sniper on a nearby rooftop ended the siege with a bullet through Huberty's heart. When the carnage ended, Huberty and 21 victims -- including grandmothers, an infant, children on bicycles and teenage McDonald's employees -- lay dead inside and outside the restaurant. Nineteen others were wounded. San Diego police Capt. Miguel Rosario, a patrol officer back then, was the first cop on the scene, believing he was responding to a single accidental shooting. Carrying a standard-issue .38-caliber revolver with six bullets, the Marine Corps veteran was in for the fight of his life against a much-better-armed opponent. ""Talk about feeling inadequate,"" Rosario said. ""He's got an Uzi, I've got a .38, and I'm thinking it's a robbery gone bad and his buddies are going to encircle me."" Rosario would later play a key role in beefing up officers' weaponry and training to stop violent criminals. When Rosario arrived at the McDonald's, he saw people hiding behind cars in the lot. He didn't know what was going on, but ""I got that little sick feeling in the pit of my stomach,"" he said.  Watch the chaos outside the McDonald's » . He looked up to see a man -- Huberty -- open a side door of the restaurant, the Uzi across his chest. The two men eyed each other, and then Huberty moved aggressively. The SWAT-trained officer ducked behind a parked pickup truck, ""and he started opening up on me,"" Rosario said. He was badly outgunned and knew it. Worse, he believed he had more than one adversary. ""I wouldn't have minded taking him on one-on-one,"" Rosario said in his transplanted South Bronx accent. ""But if he had buddies in there and they had shoulder arms, I would have been in a world of hurt."" Huberty fired about 30 armor-piercing rounds at the officer, who could hear them striking metal posts and skipping off the asphalt. From behind the truck, Rosario radioed in a Code 10 -- ""send SWAT"" -- and seconds later a Code 11 -- ""send everybody."" San Diego's SWAT team then consisted of patrol officers with extra training who carried their special equipment in their squad cars, Rosario said. Huberty retreated inside as other police units arrived. Rosario ran back to his car to retrieve his Ruger Mini-14 military-style rifle. Two patrol officers fired shotguns to cover Rosario while he took up position. But he couldn't get a clear shot. Reporter Monica Zech had a bird's-eye view of the scene. She was giving traffic reports from a small airplane for local TV and radio stations. ""I looked down and could see that there was people ducking for cover, and there was a fire truck there with everybody behind it,"" she recalled. She saw two boys lying on the ground, tangled in their bicycles after being shot by Huberty, and people hiding behind the low walls of the restaurant's playground. Circling at 3,000 feet, Zech alerted authorities to close nearby Interstate 5 and the Tijuana border crossing a few blocks away because drivers were heading straight into the line of fire. The bright sunshine and the eatery's smoked windows made it hard for police to see inside, but eventually Chuck Foster, a police sniper on the post office roof next door, got a clear view of Huberty near the counter. Foster dropped him with a single shot through a glass door. The battle was over, but the lessons were just beginning. Police clearly needed more firepower and a new strategy, Rosario said. ""The time had come where you had to have a full-time, committed and dedicated, highly trained, well-equipped team ... that were committed to shooting, being in shape and being able to respond rapidly anywhere in the city,"" he said. ""We didn't have what we have now,"" Rosario said. ""We have a special response team -- hostage rescue -- very elite, well-trained. It's an elite team within SWAT. We have access to helicopters now and all of that kind of stuff. We didn't have none of that back then."" After San Ysidro, the department created a dedicated unit that trains continuously and uses much more formidable weapons and tactics. ""We became pretty much special forces specialists, if you will,"" he said. Police departments nationwide soon realized their own need for tactical specialists. The San Ysidro massacre seemed to introduce a ""cluster"" of mass shootings in the '80s and early '90s, said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University professor and author of six books on mass murder. These included post office rampages in Oklahoma, New Jersey and Michigan, and culminated with the Luby's restaurant slaughter in Killeen, Texas, in 1991, in which 23 people were killed. Michael T. Rayburn, an independent police firearms trainer in Saratoga Springs, New York, said the San Ysidro incident and others -- including gangland battles of the 1920s and more recent episodes like the infamous North Hollywood bank shootout in 1997 and the Columbine school massacre in 1999 -- force police to keep developing new weapons and tactics. ""As police officers, we don't have wind tunnels or expensive laboratories. We've learned, unfortunately, out on the street, and we pay for it in blood and sometimes our lives,"" he said. After the McDonald's massacre, other cities sought advice from San Diego on how to develop tactical teams. Now, such elite units are part of most larger departments across the country. Another change after San Ysidro is how departments handle officers who have been involved in traumatic incidents. For the first time, San Diego debriefed all involved officers and provided professional counseling for those who needed it. Now, it is common practice. ""We saw the benefit and the need for that,"" Rosario said, though in 1984 he blew off steam in Las Vegas for two days in lieu of counseling. Many departments still fall short, but awareness of the need for psychological services is much greater now than in the '80s, said Lynn Winstead Mabe, a police counselor and consultant in Grapevine, Texas. ""I truly think they're beginning to care about the psyche of their people,"" she said.","Rampage at San Ysidro, California, McDonald's killed 21 .

"(CNN) -- As convicted murder Charles Manson comes up for parole review on Wednesday, there continues to be an enduring fascination in Hollywood regarding his crimes. The murder of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969, by members of a group known as the Manson Family left a thumbprint on American pop culture that has influenced music, movies and books. One of the latest projects is the book ""Restless Souls: The Sharon Tate Family's Account of Stardom, the Manson Murders, and a Crusade for Justice,"" written by a woman who has a personal tie with the story. In March 1990, Alisa Statman was a young film director who had just been accepted into the Director's Guild, the entertainment labor union that represents the interests of film and television directors. To celebrate, she went house hunting and discovered there was a place for lease at 10050 Cielo Drive, which happened to be the house where the infamous murders occurred. Although it was more than two decades later, as Statman was unloading boxes, someone was filming something at the house. ""The day that I was moving in, there was a supposed producer [on the property],"" said Statman, now an assistant director on ""Modern Family."" ""He was taking footage of some of the exterior. I just told him not to film me."" About two weeks later, Statman said she received a letter from that producer, Bill Nelson. Nelson said he was working on a film about the Manson murders and the Tate family, that he had the blessing of Sharon Tate's mother, Doris Tate, and asked if Statman would be interested in helping. ""Being in the business and being 21 years old, I was like 'Heck yes, I'd love to do this.' "" From there, Statman said her life was radically altered: On a filming trip, she went with Nelson to the house of a detective who had worked on the Tate case and who had mountains of police reports, photos, ""everything imaginable"" piled high on a dining room table. ""Within all those pictures, I came across these two little blue boxes,"" she recalled. ""I opened them up and there were pictures of Sharon, Jay Sebring and Wojciech Frykowski, three of the victims. They'd obviously been taken in the last week of her life. She was extremely pregnant. Along with the slides were the negatives. And they obviously had been taken from the house, during the investigation, and never returned to the family. ""I was so angry. He'd been sitting on these photos for years. The second they left the room, I pocketed them, with the intention of returning them to whoever I could find."" That person was Patti Tate, Sharon's sister, and Statman said the pair went on to strike up a romantic relationship. The director said she helped Tate work on an unpublished autobiography and continued to be close to the Tate family after Patti passed away from breast cancer in 2000. Statman spent the last five years constructing ""Restless Souls"" using what she said are Patti's unpublished manuscripts, along with the unpublished writings of Sharon and Patti's late parents, Doris and P.J. Tate. Unlike many memoirs, which are written several decades after the incidents recounted, Doris and P.J. Tate wrote their thoughts while everything that transpired was relatively fresh. The stories within, along with how Statman fell into the Tate family legacy, are yet more fodder for those who remain interested in the tragedy, 40-plus years later. ""The murders happened in the middle of the hippie movement and there was a horrible outbreak of violence in one's home,"" Statman said of the story's endurance. ""Couple that with the victims were wealthy and famous, the months and months of speculation as to who did this, only to find out that the Manson Family were right in the middle of this hippie movement. I think that scared the hell out of a lot of people."" Manson and the Manson Family have long been weaved throughout pop culture. Musician Marilyn Manson is an obvious example of someone who was influenced by the case, as well as British rock band Kasabian, who draw their name from Manson Family member Linda Kasabian. Statman, while living at Cielo Drive, sublet her house to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, where he recorded the group's second album, ""The Downward Spiral"" in a home studio he constructed called ""Le Pig."" (Sharon Tate had been hung from a rafter in her living room and the word ""Pig"" was written in her blood on the front door of the Los Angeles home.) ""About halfway through, I went to the house to pick up some stuff,"" Statman recalled. ""I was terrified by what they'd turn the house into and the bad vibes they'd brought with it. They had everything in black, there was a huge cross with blood all over it; it was just weird."" Reznor reportedly said that after meeting Patti Tate, he saw the murders from the victims' perspective. Manson has released albums of his own music and spoken word. TV specials about the murders have come in waves over the years and now the Tate story has started to get the biopic treatment. Over the past two years, reports have surfaced about three films in the works, all at various stages of development and funding. ""The Dead Circus,"" a half fiction half nonfiction account, has Michael C. Hall and Melissa Leo attached and is being directed by Adam Davenport and written by author John Kaye. Celebrity photographer Tyler Shields has been linked to a Tate biopic called ""Eyes of a Dreamer"" that reportedly has Lindsay Lohan playing Tate and Shields playing Manson. ""True Blood"" star Ryan Kwanten is attached to play Manson in an upcoming film called ""The Family,"" reportedly written and directed by Scott Kosar (""The Machinist,"" ""The Amityville Horror""). ""There's always hesitation for money to get behind the subject matter,"" said Davenport, who is still trying to secure funding for ""The Dead Circus."" ""[But] at its root, people are fascinated by evil and the psychological underpinnings behind it."" Whether these films come to fruition, even the idea that several different people are actively pursuing this story now is another nod to the influence of the Tate case. Statman said there has already been interest in the film rights to ""Restless Souls,"" but she said that for now, she's staying put with the survivors' words, as they told them, on page. ""I've gotten a few calls, but I haven't called anyone back yet,"" she said. ""I want to focus on the book now. It's been such a labor of love, I don't want to get distracted.""","Actress Sharon Tate and four others were murdered by the Manson Family in 1969 .

"New York (CNN) -- Like so many other people of my generation, John Lennon and the Beatles made an indelible stamp on my life. The very first piece of vinyl I actually owned -- and hadn't borrowed from my older brother -- was the album ""Help!"" To this day, I can remember at the age of 8 dropping the needle on the disc and hearing Lennon's voice roar through the 10-inch speaker on my record player. The Beatles had a profound influence on me. They're the reason why I picked up a guitar, formed a band at age 11 and dreamed of a life as a rock star. Fast-forward 16 years to December 8, 1980. At the time, I was a music journalist for City TV in Toronto, Canada, hosting ""The New Music"" program. Just a couple of weeks earlier, we had reported on Lennon's comeback with the album ""Double Fantasy,"" which marked his re-emergence after five years out of the music business as a self-proclaimed ""househusband."" We were actively working with his record company, trying to set up an interview for a future edition of the program. I was not far from my 24th birthday when the telephone rang on that December day around 11:30 p.m. It was my executive producer, John Martin. ""Lennon has been shot,""he said, ""and we need to do a special."" Tell us where you were when Lennon died . It was one of those moments where time seems to slow down and the mind considers a hundred questions before finally settling on the truth: . How could he have been shot? Are the reports mistaken? Who would do such a thing? How could we lose such a pop culture icon? Didn't he just turn 40? Didn't he have a young son? Didn't he have security? Will I wake up and this will all have been just a dream? We gathered that night in our offices to sift through the material that we had: old Beatles footage, a Lennon documentary that my producer shot years earlier, and the famous D.A. Pennebaker film. We collected the names of friends, collaborators and other acquaintances who could help us tell the Lennon story. A day or two later, City TV aired a live broadcast of a memorial to Lennon at Nathan Phillips Square in front of Toronto's City Hall. Canada had a rich history with Lennon: It was there that he made his post-Beatles debut with the Plastic Ono Band in 1969 and staged his famous North American bed-in in Montreal. Next Wednesday marks 30 years since Lennon's murder. His killer, Mark David Chapman, 55, is still serving his prison sentence of 20 years to life at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He will stay there for at least another two years as he was just denied parole for the sixth time. This weekend, CNN will examine the events leading up to Lennon's killing. Chapman and his wife, Gloria Abe, describe the murder in rare audio recordings that will debut on CNN's ""Losing Lennon: Countdown To Murder."" Chapman's childhood friends reveal an obsessive idolization of Lennon that later turned to hatred. His wife talks about how she knew that her husband planned to kill Lennon and explains why she didn't warn anyone. The impact of Lennon's death still reverberates today. Several tribute concerts and ceremonies started in October, when Lennon would have turned 70, and have carried on since. This year, Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, revived the Plastic Ono Band with current rock stars including Lady Gaga. Ono told Rolling Stone she believes this rekindling of interest in Lennon ""has to do with the social climate, with wanting some of John's energy, power and conviction."" Lennon's profound influence on music and musicians continues to this day. Marc Roberge, the lead singer of alt-rockers O.A.R., was not even 2 years old when Lennon was killed. Roberge penned the recent song ""Dakota"" after stopping by Lennon's old apartment building with his wife. He was so taken with the images that came to mind as he looked into the entranceway where Lennon was shot that he walked across Central Park West, sat down on a park bench and penned these lyrics: . Outside the archway lies a thief, awaiting Double Fantasy . He's something evil underneath . Outside Dakota died the symphony . ""I watched and I tried to imagine this going down,"" Roberge told me. ""And then I tried to imagine what if it never happened, and that's really the question of the song: 'If you just kept walking on your way.' I mean, would the world be different? And I think the world would be better."" Like Roberge, I've often wondered what would have happened had Lennon not been murdered. Would the world have been a better place? There's certainly every possibility that his commitment to peace would have added something substantive to the global conversation. At the very least, we would have had years more of great music and performance from a man who was truly an artistic genius. Watch American Morning weekdays 6am to 9am ET.

"(CNN) -- It has only ever happened between two sets of sisters in the history of tennis, but Agnieszka and Urszula Radwanska could yet become the next female siblings to meet in a major final. Way back in 1890, in only the fourth edition of what would become today's U.S. Open, Ellen Roosevelt -- a first cousin of future President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- beat her sister Grace, a feat that would be unmatched for more than a century. When it did happen again, at the U.S. Open in 2001, it marked the first of eight grand slam finals between the Williams sisters -- with Venus beating younger sister Serena on the first occasion, but losing six of seven since. With Urszula having risen from 109th to 31st in the rankings during the 2012 season, her trajectory suggests there is every chance that the Radwanska sisters -- both of whom won Wimbledon as juniors -- could one day meet in a grand slam final. They have met in a grand slam before, with Urszula -- the younger at 22 -- briefly losing her usual cool en route to defeat in the first round of the 2011 U.S. Open. ""I don't ever want to play her in the first round, but in the final -- no problem,"" laughs 24-year-old ""Aga,"" whose total prize money of $12 million dwarfs that of her sibling's $1 million, reflecting her higher status as world No. 4. Almost identical . While the Poles' less powerful version of tennis will never be a match for the record-breaking Williams duo, one thing they do share with the Americans is a tight bond. ""We are best friends, we are so close,"" Urszula told CNN's Open Court. ""We have always been together -- participating, living and traveling together -- so it is nice to have my sister on tour. ""We share things, we go shopping and we have a good time, so sometimes when I am traveling alone without her I feel so lonely."" The feeling is so mutual that precisely the same words come out of her elder sister's mouth. ""My sister and I have been traveling everywhere together for the last 18 years -- the same school, same practice,"" Agnieszka says. ""We are best friends, we are so close."" Save for their hair color -- with Aga a brunette and Urszula a blonde -- and the 21 months that separate their dates of birth, there is little between them, says the firstborn. ""We are very similar personalities -- we like to have fun,"" says one of the female circuit's most popular players. ""When we are on court, we like to work hard. But off the court, we try to have fun and relax, go to the cinema and forget about tennis. ""What's different about us? We like some different food! There's not much difference."" Pride of Poland . Unlike the Williams sisters, whose homeland had been previously represented by such greats as Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Billie-Jean King (and that's not even mentioning the men), the Radwanskas are putting their country on the tennis map. Prior to them, just two Poles had made noteworthy contributions to international tennis. In the late 1970s, Wojtek Fibak reached the Top 10 on the men's ATP Tour while much further back, Jadwiga Jedrejowsa reached three grand slam finals in the 1930s which -- even if she didn't win one -- is still the Polish record for the Radwanskas to beat. Aga made her own slice of history in 2007, becoming the first Pole to win a WTA singles title when as an 18-year-old she beat Russia's Vera Dushevina in Stockholm's Nordic Light Open. She has pressed on since, adding a further 11 WTA titles and reaching her highest ranking of No. 2 in 2012, a year when she reached her first grand slam final -- albeit beaten by (who else?) Serena Williams at Wimbledon. Nonetheless, she was the first Pole to contest a grand slam final since the Open Era began in 1968 -- even if her defeat meant she missed out on a long-held dream. ""I was really close to being world No. 1 a few times in 2012 but unfortunately I didn't make it,"" she says. ""Hopefully, I will have another chance in 2013. That is the goal I have been working for for so many years -- to be number one, even for one week."" After a slower start, Urszula -- currently ranked 37th -- may feel as though she is beginning to make her mark, with 2012 having proved a breakthrough year following a back problem that hindered her early progress as a professional. She may never have progressed past the second round of any grand slam singles event, but she did break into the top 30 for the first time and reached her first WTA Tour final at the UNICEF Open in the Netherlands. ""I am very happy for her that she is doing well,"" says Agnieszka. ""She is working really hard for that, she has been through a lot of things and I am happy that she has made the top 30 already. ""Hopefully, I'll see her in the top 10 very soon -- there's a big chance."" Fatherly guidance . Much like Serena and Venus, the Poles were first taught by their father -- although in contrast to Richard Williams, Robert Radwanska did have a coaching background prior to his daughters' births. Those searching for differences can point to Agnieszka's birthplace of Krakow differing to Urszula's in Gronau, since her father was then working in the north-western German town as the local tennis pro. His profession meant the girls were surrounded by tennis from birth, with early images showing the sisters in the midst of bats and balls -- and one memorable picture showing them tottering around like ballerinas, albeit with their feet squeezed into tennis ball canisters. Their father coached Aga and Urszula from the ages of five and four respectively but he stopped traveling last year, and both are now working with Borna Bikic (Jelena Dokic's former coach) as well as Polish Fed Cup coach Tomasz Wiktorowski. Nonetheless, Robert still trains his girls whenever they go home to Krakow. ""This is our home so we love coming back,"" says Urszula of Poland's second largest city. ""Our family is here but it's good that I have a sister so I can always practice with her. I don't have to find a hitting partner and also our coach is our dad, so it's perfect."" The historic city is by no means perfect for the tennis professionals -- it has no hard court, for example -- but its enduring appeal for the girls more than makes up for that. ""It's always a great feeling to be here, especially since we are traveling 10 months a year,"" says Aga. ""Even if I can only go home for two days, I will as it's always nice to just sit on my couch, watch TV and be in my kitchen. Those two days make a huge difference -- it feels like I have a normal life."" For the rest of the year, the sisters are largely on the road -- sometimes together, sometimes not -- and they always find a way of staying in contact. ""When something's happened to me, Aga is the first to know,"" says Urszula. ""We talk to each other all the time -- on Skype, over the phone, texting. We are always in touch."" Sister act . More often than not, they are normally in the same place -- and not just playing singles, but also teaming up for doubles together. In London last year, where Agnieska was honored to be Poland's Olympic flag bearer, they had mixed fortunes, exiting the Games in the second round before withdrawing from the third round at Wimbledon to help Aga, suffering from illness, in her singles bid. With a WTA doubles title already to their name, at Istanbul in 2007, the next step is to join the select band of sisters to have won a grand slam doubles title -- with the Williams and Roosevelts joined only by Ukrainians Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko in the history books. Even if they fail, one thing is for sure -- the Radwanska sisters are inspiring the next generation of Polish tennis players. ""I can clearly see that tennis in Poland is getting better. A lot of kids are trying to play right now and trying to be professionals -- so it's nice to see that -- and people are talking more about tennis so it's becoming more popular,"" says Urszula. ""And when I see Aga having great results, I want to be the same or even better.""","World No. 4 Agnieszka Radwanska and younger sister Urszula reveal their tight bond .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer says it's naive to think tennis doesn't have drug cheats. But Janko Tipsarevic, who has played at the year-end championships the previous two seasons, is of the belief that his fellow professionals aren't doping -- or at least not on a widespread basis. Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray -- the sport's most influential players who have combined won more than 30 grand slam titles -- have all called for either more tests or stricter controls, and last month the International Tennis Federation duly announced that it was adopting the biological passport program. ""I live in the belief that we are playing a clean sport,"" world No. 10 Tipsarevic told CNN's Open Court. ""If there is doping involved, maybe there is, maybe there isn't. But I can guarantee you that the people I'm hanging around with, none of them (are) doping."" In the new initiative a player's blood profile can be tracked, similar to cycling, a sport still reeling from Lance Armstrong's admission that he used performance enhancing drugs. Significant changes can alert authorities to a potential doping infraction and more blood tests will also be carried out. According to ITF statistics, Tipsarevic was among the minority of players who had to provide samples both in competition and outside of it in 2012. The number of samples he provided in competition, in the highest category listed as seven or more, put him in the minority, too. The figures didn't include tests carried out by national doping agencies and at the Olympics and Paralympics. As a top-50 player, Tipsarevic must adhere to the so-called whereabouts rule by making himself available to be tested in an one-hour slot for an out-of-competition test if the drug testers randomly come calling. The rule has often given players headaches, with Serena Williams, the women's world No. 1, telling reporters in Dubai in February that testers had once paid her a visit in Mauritius. ""I like things as they are because the international doping agency needs to know every single day of my life where I am and if I'm changing locations,"" Tipsarevic said. ""We need to fill out this form to say today we're going to be there and at any time they can come and test us. On top of that you have the local drug testing. ""You have the tournament testing when you play tournaments ... I don't want to take it too far."" In February, Murray called for more blood testing, saying that tennis needed to do everything it could ""to ensure that everyone competing at the highest level and below is clean."" While just under 2,000 urine samples were collected in 2012, less than 200 blood tests were conducted.","Janko Tipsarevic is adamant that none of the players he hangs around with are drug cheats .

"Cairo (CNN) -- About half all Egypt's registered voters had cast ballots through the second and final day of the country's historic presidential election, a top elections official said Thursday. Voting continued into the night Thursday. Farouk Sultan, head of the Higher Presidential Committee, vowed on state television that the election would continue until the last person in any given polling station had cast his vote. Amid worries by some that Egypt's current military rulers might somehow hijack the election, Sultan detailed the vote counting process -- including checks and balances aimed at insuring credibility. According to the committee head, votes will be tallied in the various polling locales by a judge and in the presence of representatives of the candidates. Each final count will be announced aloud, then an official report will be filed that can be viewed by nonprofit groups, the media and candidates, said Sultan. There are 13 candidates on the ballot, although two withdrew from the race after ballots were printed. If no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the first round, a second round will be held June 16-17. Results of the first round are not expected before the weekend. Government employees were given the day off work to vote to decide who will be Egypt's first president since Hosni Mubarak, who led the North African nation for 30 years before resigning amid a popular outcry. He is awaiting the court's verdict and could potentially face the death penalty after going on trial for allegedly ordering the killing of anti-government protesters and corruption. Voting went smoothly in a northern suburb of Cairo earlier Thursday, where women waited between 30 and 45 minutes to cast their ballots. A day earlier, a wave of enthusiasm swept across polling stations, with some waiting up to four hours to vote. ""Finally, Egypt is born,"" one weeping 80-year-old man told U.S. Rep. David Dreier, a California Republican who is in Cairo as an election observer. Grandmother Nadia Fahmy, 70, was so determined to be the first one to vote at her polling station that she camped out in a plastic chair for 2Â½ hours before it opened on Wednesday. ""I am here to vote for the first time in my life,"" said Fahmy. ""I want to see a new generation for my country. I want everything to change."" Zakaria: Is Egypt ready? After polls closed that day, a former top U.N. official called the election a potential turning point for the country. If ""ordinary Egyptians see this as a legitimate expression of their own popular will,"" regardless of who wins, ""then it can be a prelude to the real return of security and stability in the country,"" said Mark Malloch Brown. The former top diplomat and development expert said he was very optimistic about what lay ahead for Egypt in a few years down the road, even if the country was probably in for a ""bumpy ride"" in the short term. ""We went through this with Eastern Europe after 1989,"" when the Communist regimes there fell, Malloch Brown told CNN's ""Connect the World"" program. ""It just takes time. People need to settle into a new political order. Whatever happens in the next months, people need to just hold onto the fact that (Egypt) will get there."" He predicted that a post-revolutionary Egypt would be ""a little bit more Islamic than it was before, a little bit more feisty and independent vis-a-vis the U.S. and Israel,"" while domestically, it would ""really try and focus on doing a much better deal for poor Egyptians."" Egypt elections: 'Women need a champion' The voting is a monumental achievement for those who worked to topple Mubarak in one of the seminal developments of the Arab Spring more than a year ago. And it could reverberate far beyond the country's borders, since Egypt is in many ways the center of gravity of the Arab world. Egyptian police officers convicted of murder in protest crackdown . ""Egypt has always set trends in the Arab world and for Arab political thought. Trends spread through the Arab world and eventually affect even non-Arab, Muslim-majority countries,"" said Maajid Nawaz, the chairman of Quilliam, a London-based think tank. Egypt's election ""bodes well for the rest of the Arab world and particularly those countries that have had uprisings,"" said Nawaz, a former Islamist who was imprisoned in Egypt for four years for banned political activism. In a report released Thursday, Amnesty International was critical of the military leaders who rule Egypt in its annual report on human rights around the world. ""In some cases they've continued the abuses of the Mubarak regime, in that over 100 people have been killed in the streets in demonstrations as a result of excessive force used by security or military forces,"" said Philip Luther, deputy director for the advocacy group's Middle East and North Africa program. Amnesty is also opposed to the use of ""virginity testing"" on some women protesters, saying it is ""tantamount to torture and totally unacceptable."" The authorities have not done enough to ensure that women can contribute on an equal footing with men to the ongoing process of political reform, Luther also said. Amnesty wants whoever takes office as president to end the state of emergency and end the use of military trials for civilians. Egypt's revolution: 'We fell in love, but it was a trick' The concern about the powerful military possibly swaying this week's vote persists despite the insistence of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces that it will hand over power to an elected civilian government. The military leaders put armored personnel carriers on the streets with loudspeakers broadcasting a message that they will relinquish power, but that did not convince doubters. Some 30,000 volunteers have fanned out to make sure the voting is fair, said organizers with the April 6 youth movement, which has long campaigned for greater democracy and rule of law in Egypt. They reported only minor violations on Wednesday, mostly supporters of one candidate or another trying to influence voters at polling stations. Nawaz, the analyst in London, said Egypt probably is not heading toward a simple case of the military either giving up control or rejecting the results of the election. Instead, he anticipated, there will be an ""unhappy settlement"" where the military remains ""ever-present, in the shadows,"" influencing the civilian government without controlling it. Old politics joins new in Egypt . ""Egypt is going along similar lines to Turkey or Pakistan,"" he said, naming two other countries that have formal democracies in place but where a powerful military can affect events. The degree to which the military continues to exercise control in Egypt will depend on who wins the election, Nawaz anticipated -- but he laughed aloud when asked to predict who that would be. Whoever wins the election, Nawaz said, will face tremendous challenges, even without worries about the army. ""They are inheriting a failed economy, an abysmal bureaucracy, a frustrated people, and a deep distrust on behalf of the people towards their military and any policing,"" Nawaz said. Protesters are upset at what they see as the slow pace of reform since Mubarak's ouster. Some are also concerned that the country's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. And Egypt has an elaborate political mosaic where alliances shift quickly, he added. Secular democrats oppose military rule, for example, but if an Islamist candidate wins the presidency, ""Some of the democrats would switch because they would rather have military rule than the Islamists,"" Nawaz said. Opinion: Egypt's military must stop torturing detainees . ""It's far more complicated than 'Islamists vs. liberal democracy.' It's rich vs. poor, (hardline) Salafists vs. the (more moderate) Muslim Brotherhood, secularists vs. Islamists,"" he said. On top of that, the country does not yet have a new constitution defining the powers of the president or the parliament, after a court last month suspended the committee charged with writing it. The court ruled that the members of the committee did not reflect the national population well enough. Among the candidates vying for the presidency are Mohamed Morsi, of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party; Amre Moussa, who served as foreign minister under Mubarak and headed the Arab League; Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a moderate Islamist running as a respected independent; Ahmed Shafik, who was Mubarak's last prime minister; and Hamdeen Sabahy, a leftist dark-horse contender. In January, two Islamist parties -- the Freedom and Justice Party with 235 seats and the conservative Al Nour party with 121 seats -- won about 70% of the seats in the lower house of parliament in the first elections for an elected governing body in the post-Mubarak era. The rest of the assembly's 498 seats were divided among other parties. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Hala Gorani and journalists Ian Lee and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report from Cairo. Richard Allen Greene and Laura-Smith Spark reported from London.","NEW: A top Egyptian election official reports 50% turnout through the second day of voting .

""Yes,"" said Martorano, who has admitted to 20 murders and who earlier served 12 years in prison on a government deal for his cooperation in the case against Bulger. Martorano acknowledged he didn't like the term ""hitman"" since he ""wouldn't accept money"" for the killings he committed. And he countered the prosecution's descriptions of him as a ""mass murderer"" and a ""serial killer."" ""A serial killer kills because they like it. I didn't like it. I never had any joy in it,"" said Martorano, now 72. Prosecutors say Martorano killed at the direction of Boston's Winter Hill Gang and Bulger, who is standing trial on 19 murder charges along with racketeering and extortion charges. Bulger was caught in 2011 after spending 16 years as a fugitive and landing on the FBI's most wanted list. Witness: Heartbroken to know Bulger was FBI informant . ""My father, the priests, the nuns"" taught him to always ""defend family and friends,"" Martorano testified. When Brenann asked whether there was ""any honor or integrity in what you did,"" Martorano replied, ""I thought so."" Under questioning by prosecutors, Martorano explained that the six partners who comprised the Winter Hill Gang -- including Bulger, Steven Flemmi, and Martorano -- had to agree on business decisions and targeted hits. Flemmi is serving life terms without parole but avoided a possible death sentence by cooperating with federal authorities. ""Was it a democracy?"" prosecutor Fred Wyshak asked, referring to the Winter Hill Gang. ""So to speak,"" answered Martorano. The former mobster described Bulger's role in six more murders Tuesday, implicating him in a total of 13 killings in just two days of testimony. In one case, Martorano claimed that Bulger fired the fatal shot that killed one of the gang's targets, a Dorchester, Massachusetts, bartender who was ""squealing"" about a murder he had helped the crew commit. That testimony marked the first time that Bulger was placed on the firing end of a gun in a killing. In another slaying, Bulger sat at the wheel of a car, while another crime associate, Tommy King, sat in the passenger seat, with Martorano behind him, the witness said. 2012: Bulger's girlfriend pleads guilty . All had guns but ""Tommy's had blanks."" When the car pulled out ""I shot him in the back of the head,"" Martorano testified. ""I was driving over Neponset bridge (in Boston) one day and Whitey said tip your hat to Tommy .... He's over there,"" Martorano testified, acknowledging that he knew where King's body had been dumped. Martorano said that Bulger's ""plan B"" to take the heat off the Winter Hill Gang for King's murder was to kill King's good friend, Buddy Leonard, and put him in King's car to make it look like the two got into a dispute that ended with Leonard's death and King's disappearance. Leonard subsequently was found shot to death. Another time, Bulger sat at a table with another crime associate the partners had decided to kill. As planned, Bulger was counting money with the man when Martorano walked in and shot the man in the temple. In 1982, Martorano testified, he felt ""really bad"" about it but carried out a killing anyway. Outnumbered in the decision by his partners, he killed his friend John Callahan. That came about after another killing: Callahan wanted to buy a business from Oklahoma businessman Roger Wheeler. When Wheeler wouldn't sell, Callahan asked Martorano to kill him. Martorano said he flew to Oklahoma, picked up a suitcase with machine guns, revolvers and masks that had been shipped from Boston via Greyhound bus, and shot Wheeler between the eyes. Callahan was so grateful he paid his friend $50,000. 2011: Clues that lead to Bulger's capture . But when trusted FBI contact John Connolly indicated that Callahan was going to be pressured by the government to testify about the murder, the Winter Hill partners, with Martorano outvoted, decided it was too risky for Callahan to live. ""I felt lousy but these were my partners. We were up to our necks in murders already,"" Martorano testified. He said he arranged to meet Callahan in Florida, picking him up at the airport and helping him with his bags. Then as Callahan got into the front seat, Martorano got in behind and shot his friend in the head. ""I felt really bad. I'd just killed a man I'd risked my life for in Oklahoma,"" he testified. Asked by the prosecutor whether he regretted his life of crime, Martorano responded, ""Who wouldn't?"" During Martorano's testimony, Bulger sat ramrod straight and kept his eyes focused ahead, barely moving. Bulger turned his head, seeming to look at his former friend sitting just six feet away, only when Martorano said he learned Bulger was an FBI informant.","72-year-old John Martorano is the government's star witness against Bulger .

"(CNN) -- You'd think John Isner and Nicolas Mahut would be sick of the sight of each other. But from the ashes of their record-breaking marathon match at Wimbledon in 2010 -- officially the longest in tennis history -- an enduring ""bromance"" has blossomed. It had to, after the pair walked on court for a low-key first-round match in the men's singles draw, limping off three days later after 11 hours of tennis, battered, bruised, fatigued, but lauded as heroes the world over. Even if either should go on to win a glut of major titles in their respective careers, it is entirely possible they will still forever be known for ""the marathon match."" Far from resenting the attention their epic encounter brought them, the pair are firm friends; not surprising, given they are the only players on the planet to know just how much that eight-hour final set, which ended 70-68 in Isner's favour, can take from you. ""I'm actually really close with him,"" Isner told CNN's Open Court. ""Prior to that match, I knew him but it seemed in passing, I'd give him a head nod, nothing more than that but from that match, I've realized that he is one of the nicest, classiest guys on tour. ""He actually is a really good friend of mine. We keep in touch all the time so we developed a friendship from that match, obviously sharing a court for three days."" Isner is now officially the highest ranked American in the world following Andy Roddick's retirement, but try as he might to move on from the marathon match it is almost always top of the list when tennis fans approach him. So what was it like to be involved in an episode that transfixed the world? ""Yeah, it was crazy. I don't think people will remember the fact that I won that match. I think it would be more the fact that we played it ... Nicolas Mahut, he was a warrior that day,"" Isner said. ""I do hear it all the time, it's something that's going to stick with me forever but I've feel like I've done some things out of that match. I've broken the top 10. ""I had a few marquee wins under my belt so I've done some good things to try to shed that label but it's up to me to keep doing more."" Many expected a tight encounter, given the serving prowess of both players and Isner won that battle too, firing down 112 aces compared to Mahut's 103. For a player who stands at 6 foot 9 inches, Isner's serve is undoubtedly the most powerful weapon in his armory. When it fires, few in the world can live with him, even in this golden age of Federer, Murray, Djokovic and Nadal. He has five ATP Tour titles to his name, winning twice at the Newport and Winston-Salem events. Last weekend he competed at Indian Wells, where in 2012 he saw off world No. 1 Novak Djokovic before losing to Roger Federer in the final. On Saturday he was beaten in his opening match by Australian veteran Lleyton Hewitt. ""If I can get that opportunity where I can play those guys ranked in the top five of the world, that's when I usually see myself raise my game,"" Isner explains. ""I like playing on those big stages and I think that's one of the main reasons why I beat Federer, I beat Djokovic and I almost beat Rafa at the French Open of all places. That's why you play this game -- to get a crack at those guys, try to take it to them. ""Outside of my serve, I think my forehand is my best shot,"" he added. ""It's no secret. My game isn't rocket science. The more aggressive I am, the better my results are going to be. ""I have to be really aggressive with my forehand. Something that I'm constantly working on. I need to return better. If I can do that, I'll see a lot more success but my serve is my weapon and that's something that I rely on all the time."" But while that towering frame benefits his imposing serve, it can also hinder his movement around the court. No surprise then, that Isner invests a huge amount of training time on improving his on-court coverage. ""I'm always trying to work on my weaknesses which in the main part is my movement. I can improve that aspect.,"" he said. ""If I can improve my movement just a little bit, my game will improve a lot so other than that, my height certainly helps me with my serve first and foremost but it's also a bit of a detriment when it comes to moving around the court."" ""The game is pretty physical today where you see these guys running down balls. You can't hit a winner on some of these guys but for me, that's not the case."" Isner may have found it difficult to shake off the ""marathon man"" tag but there are some other things that have stuck with him by his own choosing -- like his love for wrestling. The spectacle of World Wrestling Entertainment may not be to everyone's tastes but Isner and his friends still gather round to watch it every week. ""Although it is scripted, I do have great respect for these guys. A lot of guys make fun of me but these guys are actually putting their bodies on the line,"" he said. ""Growing up in North California, me and all my friends, it was pretty sad but our weeks revolved around a Monday night. ""Monday night wrestle would come on and we'd all huddle up and pay per views would come on and I'd get 10 of my friends to come over -- $5 each, so we could pay the $50 to watch the pay per view. ""It's something that I've always liked and I haven't grown out of it either. You know, at 27 at 6 ft 10 ins, I haven't grown out of that stage so for me, it's something I do to pass time on Monday nights.""","""Marathon men"" John Isner and Nicolas Mahut have forged close friendship .

"(CNN) -- Back in February the worldwide union for professional footballers FIFPro, conducted a survey of thousands of players in Eastern and Southern Europe, detailing the true extent of match-fixing, racism and violence in European football. Just over nine percent of respondents in FIFPro's Black Book survey reported examples of racism or other forms of discrimination, mainly caused by supporters (65.3%). The survey included the testimony of Dragisa Pejovic of FC Novi Pazar, who detailed what it was like to play football in Serbia. ""I have played for FC Borac Cacak for six years,"" said Pejovic. ""In that time, there were always problems of violence and racism. ""I remember a game where fans of my team insulted my colleague from Zimbabwe, Mike Tamvanjera, because he is a black man. This was the first case of racism in Serbia and the racism is still present."" But it wasn't just racism that Pejovic encountered. ""I do not know any professional player in Serbia who has been able to provide the most basic requirements for life,"" added Pejovic. ""Football in Serbia is full of crime and criminals and I could not cope, nor fight, with them alone. ""The criminals in Serbian football always look after their own interests first and use all means to achieve their goals, while the players have to keep silent and suffer."" Fast forward to October and Serbia is facing more scrutiny after England's Football Association reported ""a number of incidents of racism"" to European governing body UEFA following the second-leg of an Under-21 Euro 2013 playoff match on Tuesday. Danny Rose, a midfielder on loan at English Premier League side Sunderland from Tottenham Hotspur, claims he was subjected to monkey chants before, during and after the match, while also alleging he had stones thrown at him by the crowd during the game. Rose was given a red card for kicking a ball into the stands after England scored a winning goal with the last kick of the match, sparking a mass brawl between both sets of players and staff. Genocidal war . The Serbian Football Association painted a very different picture of events on Tuesday, saying it ""absolutely refuses and denies that there were any occurrences of racism before and during the match at the stadium in Krusevac"". However, that view was directly contradicted by the Serbian technical director Savo Milosevic who went into England's dressing room after the game to apologize. ""I have a lot of friends in England, I played there,"" referring to his spell playing for Aston Villa between 1995 and 1998. ""I feel terrible about what happened because the people in England received us really well and I wanted to give them the same thing in Serbia."" UEFA has subsequently charged both the English and Serbia FAs following events in Krusevac. The Serbian FA has been charged with alleged racist chanting by fans, while both associations face charges overr the behavior of their players . As the Serbian and English FAs jostled for the moral high ground, British Prime Minister David Cameron waded into the debate . He called on UEFA to impose ""tough sanctions"" on racism while sports minister Hugh Robertson has written to European governing body's president Michel Platini following ""extreme provocation and racism"" during Tuesday game. Over the last year English football has had to grapple with the fall out of racism cases involving Liverpool striker Luis Suarez and Chelsea defender John Terry, with English FA punishing both players. The difficulty for Serbia, as shown by Pejovic's testimony, is that it has a history of racism not just at club level but also at international level, which Milosevic acknowledged, though he insisted that the problem ""is no more than in other European countries"". Five years ago, during another U-21 match between England and Serbia, the Balkan country was fined Â£16,000 ($26,000) by UEFA for racial abuse directed at England defender Nedum Onouha. In February 2011, Platini warned Serbia and its clubs that a ban on competing could be imposed if fans continued to cause trouble. ""It's important to remember that Serbia has only just come out of a genocidal war and that as events on Tuesday unfolded in Belgrade, former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic is on trial in The Hague,"" said professor Clifford Stott, who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice, referring to Balkan wars between 1991 and 1999. ""So we shouldn't be surprised these societal problems manifest themselves in football,"" added Stott, who runs his own consultancy and training company Crowd and Conflict Management Ltd. ""What we are seeing is a failure of various authorities to regulate behavior inside Serbian stadiums. ""Over the last two years UEFA has been trying to address the problem in Serbia. It is fully aware of the problems that exist there -- and working with the European Union Think Tank -- has been undertaking visits to Serbia to initiate reforms, but clearly these interventions haven't yet worked. ""What happened reflects a lack of proper regulation within the stadiums, and the effective management of crowds through legislation, policing, stewarding and also stadium licensing."" Heysel . During the 1980s, UEFA banned English clubs from competing in its club competitions for a number of years after the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. The English Professional Footballers' Association chairman Clarke Carlisle believes UEFA must impose a similar sanction on Serbia -- if the racism allegations are proven. ""UEFA should ban Serbia from international tournaments,"" said Carlisle. ""I believe that this is what happened to England when violence and hooliganism came to the fore and that was what caused us to address the problem. ""It's only a ban of this nature, which has these ramifications, that will cause Serbia as a football nation to address it."" Professor Stott also backed Carlisle's call for UEFA to act decisively. ""I would argue that UEFA now need to impose an effective sanction,"" said Stott, who is a visiting professor at Denmark's Aarhus University. ""I would support calls to ban Serbia from international football and their clubs from European football if such racist activity occurs. ""Out of all the agencies that have influence -- the EU, the European Council, the Serbian government and FA, UEFA is the most powerful in these circumstances. ""Don't forget this is ultimately about money and a ban in UEFA competitions will hit the Serbian Football Association and the clubs in the pocket. These international and European fixtures are key sources of revenue."" Ahead of the recent Euro 2012 tournament, Stott collaborated in the running of a Pan-European police training program to share best practice among the continent's police forces. ""Lots of European countries were involved, but countries like Serbia, Croatia and Greece were not,"" added Stott. Government intervention . The academic urged the Serbian government and its football association to lead by example. ""The Serbian government has to make it an offence to actually monkey chant in a stadium. It is in the UK, but I'm not convinced it will be in Serbia. If it's not an offence the police can do nothing about it nor the FA even if they wanted to. ""At the same time the FA and the clubs need to create an environment of authority and governance to regulate behavior and expel those involved in it inside the stadiums. ""In the UK we have CCTV, seated stadia, ticket numbers to identify which seat someone is sitting, shared information agreements between police and clubs, effective stewarding, police steward frameworks of co-operation. ""That all comes back of the Taylor report,"" added Stott, referring to Lord Taylor's recommendation to improve stadium safety following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. ""All of this stuff has to be in place to move the situation forward in Serbia. As you have seen the Serbian FA have simply denied it took place, and the idea of getting anti-racist legislation enacted in Serbia is almost surreal."" Milosevic accepted that action was needed from the Serbian government. ""The only difference I see is the actions of the governments in the respective countries. Some countries are more decisive and more powerful and they deal with it,"" said the former Aston Villa striker. ""Unfortunately we have a lot of problems inside our country and our government right now. In the last 10-15 years we've had other problems besides football supporters.""

"(CNN) -- Grieving for a fellow player is, sadly, nothing new for members of the 1994 San Diego Chargers. Legendary linebacker Junior Seau, who was found dead Wednesday of an apparent suicide, is now the eighth player from that team to die. The 1994 Chargers, a group of gritty overachievers, are the only edition of the team to make the Super Bowl. But instead of that feat being the team's legacy, many are wondering about the string of freakish deaths that have haunted the AFC championship team. ""Not again,"" former Chargers running back Natrone Means said to the San Diego Union-Tribune after one of the deaths in 2008. ""It's crazy, just crazy, that we've had so many guys who have fallen. I can't make any sense of it. I've given up trying. You just hope you quit getting these random messages out of nowhere that another teammate has passed away."" The tragic list includes: . -- In 1995, about five months after the Chargers lost to the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl, linebacker David Griggs died in a car crash. He was 28. -- In May 1996, running back Rodney Culver died in a plane crash. He was 26. -- In July 1998, linebacker Doug Miller died after being struck by lightning while camping. He was 28. -- In May 2008, center Curtis Whitley was found dead of a drug overdose. He was 39. -- In October 2008, defensive end Chris Mims died of complications from an enlarged heart. He was 38. -- In February 2011, defensive tackle Shawn Lee died of a heart attack. He was 44. -- In December, linebacker Lew Bush died of a heart attack. He was 42. Then Wednesday, tragedy hit the team and the NFL community again when Seau was found dead in a bedroom of his Oceanside, California, home. A handgun was found near his body. He was 43. His crestfallen mother sobbed loudly as she spoke outside the home just two hours after police were called there Wednesday. ""I pray to God, 'Take me; take me; leave my son,' but it's too late,"" Luisa Seau said. Bobby Ross, who coached the Chargers during the 1994 season, was one of the many mourning after the news of Seau's death. ""Junior, to me, was the epitome of what a football player was,"" Ross said. ""Tremendous team player. Tremendous leader. Tremendous leader on our football team."" Ross has said Seau was the heart and soul of that 1994 team. The Chargers shocked the football world by beating the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game to get to the Super Bowl. That season the Charger's defense was led by Seau's team-leading 124 tackles. In an interview Wednesday with CNN affiliate WTVR, Ross said he did not want to speculate on whether mental health issues or other issues could have caused the string of deaths for his former players. He just wanted to talk about Seau. ""I'm totally shocked and very, very saddened by the whole thing,"" Ross said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Information gathered by a renewed investigation into actress Natalie Wood's 1981 drowning death has persuaded the Los Angeles coroner to remove ""accidental"" from her death certificate, a detective said. The death certificate was amended on August 7 to list her death as caused by ""drowning and other undetermined factors"" rather than ""accidental drowning,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Kevin Lowe said Wednesday. Lowe and a partner are still working the case, which is an open and active investigation, Lowe said. Last November, homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who said they had additional information about the actress's drowning, the sheriff's department said. Police pursue 'intriguing' information in Natalie Wood case . ""This new information is substantial enough to make us want to take a new look at the case,"" Lt. John Corina said at the time. The announcement persuaded tipsters to come forward with additional ""intriguing"" information, sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore told CNN last January. Investigators did not comment directly on statements made in news reports in November by Dennis Davern, the captain of a yacht owned by Wood and her husband, actor Robert Wagner. Davern offered a new account of how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had. Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who has been interviewed, but they did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect. Wood drowned in the Pacific Ocean on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. She once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater. Her body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht, in a long nightgown, socks and a down jacket, according to police reports. The autopsy report showed the actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms. ""My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,"" said Lana Wood, referring to theories that the actress voluntarily jumped from the boat. Although the county coroner's office ruled at the time that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense. In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play. ""I just want the truth to come out, the real story,"" she said. Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour, broke his long silence with a detailed account of that day in ""Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,"" a book he wrote with his friend Marti Rulli. It was published in September 2009. Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner. Natalie Wood's star power lasted for decades . In a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request. Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They often sailed their yacht off the coast of California, and they invited Wood's ""Brainstorm"" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on a sail on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981. The Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous of Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple. Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book ""Pieces of My Heart,"" also published in September 2009. He acknowledged that there had been a fight with Wood, writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table. After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting. Embarrassed, Davern said, he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. ""They'd moved their fight outside ... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,"" he said. A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing. Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper. Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off. Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own, he wrote. He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood. The dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found. Wood's first starring role was as a child in ""Miracle on 34th Street"" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading men -- James Dean in ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and Warren Beatty in ""Splendor in the Grass."" She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for ""Love with the Proper Stranger"" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in ""West Side Story."" Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two popular series, ""It Takes a Thief"" (1968-70) and ""Hart to Hart"" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the ""Austin Powers"" spy spoofs.

"(CNN) -- Stargazers in North America were delighted this week to see a highly anticipated comet make an appearance in the March sky. The comet is called Pan-STARRS, and it gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in June 2001: the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System in Hawaii. Brian Karczewski, 24, got a great shot of the comet from a California church parking lot and submitted an iReport about it. ""I love astronomy and find astrophotography a good challenge,"" he said. ""I was very excited to capture the comet next to the moon. Never photographed a comet before!"" Adam Block, program coordinator at the Mount Lemmon Sky Center at the University of Arizona, snapped his first Pan-STARRS picture March 10. He used a DSLR camera and a 300mm fixed lens. ""I took that image from my house in Tucson, and I was hoping to show that anyone, even from the city, can potentially see the comet!"" he said in an e-mail. Quasar -- galactic beauty, deadly beast -- discovered 50 years ago . Block also took some sharp images Tuesday against the background of a colorful twilight. ""A bright comet in the sky is great for me since the universe is giving me a new and captivating way to inspire people as part of the experiences I offer at the observatory,"" he said. Send us your questions about time-lapse videos . If you missed Pan-STARRS, there may be another comet-viewing opportunity later this year. Comet ISON was discovered by Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok in September 2012. It's named after their night-sky survey program, the International Scientific Optical Network. On November 28, ISON is expected to dive into the sun's atmosphere. If it survives, it might glow as brightly as the moon and be briefly visible in daylight. Its tail might stretch far across the night sky. More space and science news from CNN Light Years.

"(CNN) -- In his time as a New York City police officer, Stephen Spiro says that it only happened to him once. Typically, the people he arrested wanted nothing to do with him. But then, few things about the case of Mark David Chapman were typical. Chapman, the man convicted of killing former Beatle John Lennon, wrote Spiro, his arresting officer, four letters. In the letters, Chapman repeatedly tells Spiro to read ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" saying the book would explain much of what happened the night of the murder, December 8, 1980. He expresses an ease with the officer, saying he hoped they could be friends, that he thought Spiro was a great policeman, and that he had felt close to him ever since his arrest. Chillingly, Chapman also wrote that others ""could -- and would -- have served the same purpose"" as Lennon. The four letters are expected to go on sale Monday on the Moments in Time website, which sells rare autographs and historical documents. Spiro says they represent the only time someone he arrested wrote him letters. ""They've been in my possession for 30 years, and I'm 66 years old, and I'm saying, you know, what am I going to do with these things? So I figured I'd sell them,"" he told CNN. The letters run from January to May 1983. Each one is typed and includes Chapman's signature. Spiro says he wrote a few letters in return, but Chapman ""cut it off after a while."" The two men spent several hours together immediately after Chapman's arrest. He trusted Spiro. Chapman, who was denied parole for the seventh time in August, is serving a sentence of 20 years to life. The letters will be on sale for $75,000, said Gary Zimet, who runs the Moments in Time site. The site is also selling a ""Double Fantasy"" record album, which Lennon signed for Chapman before his murder, for $650,000. Spiro said that he plans to donate some of the money he makes to a local shelter for battered women. Here are excerpts from Chapman's letters: . January 15, 1983 . "" ... I am glad that we can keep in touch. I'll not forget the first time we met ... ""Besides wanting to be your friend, there are two reasons for this first letter. First, is there any way that you can help me locate my copy of The Catcher in the Rye that was taken from me on the night of my arrest? Second, in the patrol car on the way to the stationhouse, I remember you telling your partner -- very excitedly -- that you KNEW something big was going to happen to you on that evening. Do you remember this? I would like you to tell me more of this if possible. ""Steven, have you read The Catcher in the Rye yet? I would like you to read it and tell me what you think of it. As you remember, in the copy that was taken from me I had written 'This is my statement'. I am wondering if you now understand this. ""Write soon. Let me know how you're doing. As I've said before, you're probably still the 'best damn cop in New York City'. "" January 28, 1983 . ""... The reason I wanted to write was from the time of my arrest I have felt close to you ... ""To answer your question of what was meant by 'This is my statement', the only way I can explain is this way: do you remember the young woman in Saigon during the Vietnam war that immolated herself? ... She believed so strongly in her purpose that she chose to end her life rather than to continue living in this phony world ... ""The Cather in the Rye is my statement. The book in incredible ... ""We were all part of something big, Steve. Something phenomenal. It is all going to come out."" March 10, 1983 . ""... You mentioned your family. Tell me about your children. How about a photo, too? ""Have you read The Catcher in the Rye yet? I know this will help you to further understand ... ""I will let you decide whether Mr. Lennon was a phony or not. His words shoot his life-purpose full of holes. If you dig deep -- and not idolize -- it is all there. Yes, Lennon was a phony of highest degree but there were others who could -- and would -- have served the same purpose. I believe the DA has these names."" May 31, 1983 .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, I will have the honor of serving as grand marshal in the New York City Pride Parade. I have marched in the parade for the last several years carrying a huge rainbow flag. Last year, I was so elated that I danced my way down the street for the entire route. Before that, my late wife Thea and I, she in her wheelchair, would watch the parade together every year. If someone had told me 50 years ago that I would be the marshal of the New York City Gay Pride Parade in 2013 at the age of 84, I never would have believed it. Over the past couple of years, many people have asked me, ""Why did you decide to sue the United States over a tax bill?"" Because the answer is complex, let me give you some of the background. I lived with and loved my late spouse, Thea Spyer, for more than four decades in love and joy, and in sickness and health, until death did us part. When Thea died in 2009 from a heart condition two years after we were finally married, I was heartbroken. On a deeply personal level, I felt distressed and anguished that in the eyes of my own government, the woman I had loved and cared for and shared my life with was not my legal spouse, but was considered to be a stranger with no relationship to me. On a practical level, because of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, I was taxed $363,000 in federal estate tax that I would not have had to pay if I had been married to a man named Theo instead of a woman named Thea. Even if I had just met Theo, married him and never even lived with him before he died, the tax would have been zero. So, overwhelmed with a sense of injustice and unfairness, I decided to file a lawsuit to get my money back. I lucked out when Robbie Kaplan, a litigation partner at the law firm of Paul Weiss, walked into my life. At a time when the gay organizations that I approached responded with, ""It's the wrong time for the movement,"" Robbie Kaplan said -- as did the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. before her -- ""There is no wrong time"" to seek justice. She answered my plea, and took me on. Robbie argued my case in the Supreme Court on March 27 this year. When she argued against DOMA, she was cool and calm and informed and reasoned -- all of which was sustained by her deeply felt passion for equality in all of our lives. And we WON -- all the way. I have been so honored and humbled to represent not only the thousands of Americans whose lives have been adversely impacted by DOMA, but those whose hopes and dreams have been constricted by that same discriminatory law. Because of the historic Supreme Court ruling in my case, the federal government can no longer discriminate against the marriages of gay and lesbian Americans. Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA. And those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married -- as Thea and I did -- but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else. To all the gay people and their supporters who have cheered me on, thank you. I'm sure that Thea is thanking you, too. Not only does a much larger portion of the ""straight"" world see us differently -- as just people who live and love and play with their kids -- but also our own community has come out and seen each other, and loved each other, in a way that makes me courageous and proud and joyous every day. If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Edith Windsor.","Edith Windsor won the Supreme Court case that overturned DOMA .
Windsor never thought she would be grand marshal of Pride Parade at 84 .
She sued over a tax bill and it led to equality for same-sex married couples .
She was anguished that her government considered her marriage illegitimate ."
"(CNN) -- The family of a Rutgers University student who committed suicide after a sexual encounter was broadcast online has consented to the use of his name on a piece of anti-harassment legislation. The family of Tyler Clementi will allow Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, to use his name in the proposed federal legislation, to be known as the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act,"" an attorney for the family said. Clementi's body was recovered from the Hudson River in September, more than a week after he jumped from the George Washington Bridge. The bridge spans the river between New York and New Jersey, which is home to Rutgers. Clementi jumped from the bridge after two other Rutgers students allegedly videotaped a sexual encounter between him and another man and streamed it online. The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" Lautenberg said last month. The legislation also classifies cyber-bullying as a form of harassment. Lautenberg said that federal funding would be provided to colleges and universities to deal with harassment and bullying against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. ""The family appreciates the courtesy extended to them during the drafting of the bill, and hopes that the legislation, if enacted, will improve the well-being and safety of America's college students,"" the family's statement said. ""The Clementi family is humbled and gratified that the loss of their son, however painful for them, has inspired nationwide discussion and awareness of the need for a renewal of values of respect for human dignity and personal privacy, particularly for young people in this time of rapidly evolving technology."" Dharun Ravi, 18, who was Clementi's roommate, and Molly Wei, 18, have been charged with invasion of privacy. Their lawyers have asserted their innocence.","The family of Tyler Clementi consented to the use of his name on the legislation .

"Jedda, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Every time I talk to a group of Syrians, I learn another layer of the complex construct that weaves Syrian society together and complicates any analysis of the conflict. Talking to Syrians in Saudi Arabia is no different. Of three Syrian National Council representatives I met who live there, two told me they shared tribal ties with Saudis. The three were actively campaigning to support the rebels back home. Guns -- big guns -- were at the top of their wish list in meetings with Saudis. Although the Syrians told me they weren't sure any were being sent, I'd have been surprised, if they told me they were. Such issues are shrouded in secrecy. What did surprise me, however, was the two Syrians with tribal ties who told me their motivation was to support their own tribes back home. Other Syrians, too, they said -- but tribe first. The borders of Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Lebanon were drawn up in 1916 by French and British cartographers, indifferent to the realities of tribal life straddling the new lines emerging over the desert sands. Today those historic tribal ties are paying dividends for Syria's rebels. The ancestral connections are igniting sympathies among some of the region's richest people. Thousands of Saudis, Kuwaitis, and Qataris share tribal kinship with their Syrian cousins. Add to tribal sympathies religious conviction. Most Saudis are Sunni Muslims, the same as the Syrian majority who kicked off the uprising. It's little wonder that when the residents of the desert kingdom dipped their hands in their pockets for the Syrians, they didn't disappoint. Close to half a billion Saudi riyals -- almost $150 million -- was raised by the end of Ramadan, a 30-day period of fasting and giving that ended this weekend. Most of it was given during a five-day telethon, much of the rest deposited in an account in a Saudi bank. The three Syrians I met told me they don't know what the money will be spent on, but they do know they won't get their hands on it. In the post-9/11 era, Saudis have cracked down on fund-raising to the point that all cash coming in for Syria is tightly controlled by the Saudi Interior Ministry. It's an attempt to prevent extremist groups like al Qaeda from benefiting from Saudi largesse. But that, according to the Syrian trio, may be hard to enforce. SNC member Mohammed Alterkawi, who also represents the high council of the Free Syrian Army, explains: ""The feeling now inside Syria is that those extremists -- they are coming here to help us, OK. And this feeling -- it make this extremist my friend, OK. So it's not enemy now, it's my friend."" Put simply, whoever gets the aid, be it guns, grain or bandages, will use it as they see fit. And if helping their new extremist friends is what it takes to win the fight in the absence of international support, that's what they'll do. And that's why these Saudi-based Syrians are doing their best to make their aid networks transparent. One Syrian dentist I met, Mohammad Yasser Tabbaa, told me he'd been to Turkey to learn how to set up a charity. He and his friends put together the Syrian Expat Medical Association, setting it up with a bank account in Paris. He can't take money from Saudis, but he can work with official registered charity collection organizations. ""So whomever comes to us, we refer them to those organizations, those relief groups, and they help us,"" he explained. How they help is quite simple.Tabbaa and his colleagues visit medical suppliers and nail the best deal for the goods. Then ""we present those projects to the local or governmental organization,"" and the Saudi government group buys the goods, delivering them to activists in Turkey, he said. By operating within Saudi law today, Tabbaa hopes his medical charity can keep on giving when the time comes to rebuild Syria. He says the group is going to great lengths to make sure it gets what it pays for. ""We ask for video tapes, for pictures, for some kind of documentation."" But he says once supplies cross the border, it's hard to maintain transparency. ""We care more about our activists than our money. I'm not willing to lose any activists on the ground, but I am willing to lose a little money."" Money isn't all the Saudis seem prepared to give. Tribal and religious ties, Tabbaa says, may inspire some to pay the ultimate price. What activists in Syria are asking for now is not medical supplies, but doctors, he says. ""I tell the young men who volunteer, 'Are you ready not to come back?' It's a life or death decision."" Even so, he says he's been told Saudi Arabia will soon start sending medics. He's still waiting to see them show up. But he doesn't doubt the bonds that shape young men's minds here are strong enough to overcome their fears.","Syrians' tribal ties with Saudis are fueling aid to Syrian rebels .
Saudi government keeps tight rein on aid to Syrian groups, trying to keep it from extremists .
Saudi-based Syrians set up charities carefully to stay within the rules .

"(CNN) -- Daryl Impey became the first South African to don the famous yellow jersey as Andre Greipel powered to his first stage win on the year's Tour de France in Montpellier Thursday. Impey claimed the race lead from Orica-GreenEdge teammate Simon Gerrans by virtue of taking 13th place behind Germany's Greipel in the frantic dash for the line. The star sprinters finished in a small group -- five seconds ahead of the main bunch -- which included Australia's Gerrans and all the main favorites for overall victory. Impey now leads the standings by three seconds from Team Sky's Edvald Boasson Hagen with Gerrans in third place at five seconds. ""It'll sink in tomorrow but I think it's going to be amazing to ride in the Tour de France as the leader,"" he told the race's official website. ""I'm going to be on a high the whole way to the finish and hopefully I'll feel like I'm floating,"" Impey added. He paid tribute to Gerrans, content to sit in the bunch while Impey played his role of lead out man for the team's sprinter Matt Goss, who faded to 15th on the stage. ""He was happy enough to let the jersey go and to give me this opportunity to wear this jersey for South Africa and myself."" It was also a triumphant day for Lotto's Greipel, edged out Slovakian Peter Sagan and fellow German Marcel Kittel after the 176.5 km from Aix-en- Provence with Britain's Mark Cavendish in fourth place. Cavendish was held up by a crash 34km from the finish and had to chase back on to the fast moving bunch. Bidding for a second straight stage win, he could not come to terms with former teammate Greipel and sat up before the line. Friday's seventh stage takes the peloton over 205.5 km ride from Montpellier to Albi. The main contenders, such as race favorite Chris Froome of Team Sky, will get their first chance to shine in the race's first mountain stages in the Pyrenees Saturday and Sunday.","Andre Greipel wins sixth stage of Tour de France in Montpellier .

"(CNN) -- There are two words that summarize the July Fourth holiday that was and the weekend ahead: hot and soggy. On Friday morning, a flash flood watch remained in effect for southeast Alabama, portions of Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, the National Weather Service said. The Panhandle is expected to get wetter into Saturday. Panama City Beach, Florida, was slammed with some of the worst flooding residents have seen in a long time. The area got 4.24 inches of rain in a short amount of time, the National Weather Service reported. ""The flooding was ridiculous,"" Bay County Sheriff's Sgt. Billy Byrd told CNN on Friday. ""We had roads and bridges out for the majority of the holiday."" The flooding was so bad that the fire department used boats to rescue dozens of county residents from flooded homes in low-lying areas, he said. Most went to stay with family members and were back at home Friday because the rain and flooding had subsided. Panama City even managed to carry on with its fireworks program when the rain let up. Sandbagging in Florida . Lynn Haven, north of Panama City, wasn't as lucky and had to postpone its celebration until later this summer, Byrd said. Video shot by CNN affiliate WMBB showed nothing but flooded streets. ""As I was driving around Lynn Haven, one gentleman stopped me and said he has lived on Minnesota Avenue for nearly 20 years and has never seen the flooding this bad,"" CNN affiliate WMBB's Chris Marchand reported. Some residents with flooded yards even had to wedge sandbags in their front doors, WMBB said, and some residents just gave up trying to drive through the flooded streets and parked their cars in the road. At one point, Marchand said, he saw a man walking through knee-deep water. In the Southeast, the eastern Tennessee Valley and Ohio Valley are hoping for a break from the rain this weekend. That's probably unlikely, the National Weather Service says, because there's a large plume of moisture from the Tropics converging across the Southeast northward toward the Great Lakes. A break ahead for California . Is there good news in this weather story? Sort of. It should cool down across the Pacific Northwest over the next few days. And the extreme heat that California has been experiencing is expected to break on Saturday, the weather service said. Parts of the state are still under an excessive heat warning, with temperatures hovering in the lower 100s, CNN meteorologist Melissa Lefevre said. Sizzling in Boston . The Northeast is continuing to sweat it out. It's going to be very hot in Boston on Friday, with a high predicted at 102 degrees, the National Weather Service said. There is heat advisory for the Boston area in effect from 11 am to 8 p.m. ET Friday. It should be hottest between 2 and 6 p.m., the weather service said. The city lists cooling centers that might help everyone stay safe. The city's Elderly Commission made robocalls to 30,000 Boston seniors, advising them of precautions to take to deal with the heat. The calls provided the number to Mayor Thomas Menino's 24-hour hotline: 617-635-4500. On Thursday, the heat caused 120 people to receive medical evaluations at Independence Day celebrations on the city's Esplanade, said Jim Hooley, chief of Boston Emergency Medical Services. Four people were taken to a local hospital as a precaution, he said. Temperatures along the Charles River reached into the 90s on the holiday. In light of the terror bombings at the Boston Marathon in April, security was very tight for the July Fourth events. ""I think it's going very well, for the most part,"" State Police Col. Timothy Alben told the The Boston Globe. ""The public has cooperated tremendously. There are always going to be some people who don't like [tight security]. We understand that. But I think it's the world we live in."" Feeling hot in Philadelphia and New York City . Meanwhile on Friday, the heat continued to oppress Philadelphia. The city was under an excessive heat watch, with temperatures expected in the lower to middle 90s, Lefevre said. And New York City will be a steamer. A heat advisory remains in effect until 8 p.m. Sunday for all five boroughs. Temperatures are expected in the lower to middle 90s, the National Weather Service shows. Cooling centers will be open Friday through Sunday throughout the city, New York City Office of Management spokesman Nancy Greco said. Public areas with air conditioning, such as senior centers and libraries, will house cooling centers for those who don't have air-conditioned homes, she said. New Yorkers can call 311 or go online to find a center near them. CNN's Morgan Winsor and Gabrielle Rodman contributed to this report.","Dozens rescued from flooding on July Fourth in Panama City Beach, Florida .

"(CNN) -- DNA may help Seattle-area sheriff's deputies find a suspect in a 20-year-old killing after a comparison with genealogy records connected a crime-scene sample to a 17th-century Massachusetts family. The DNA sample was taken in the death of 16-year-old Sarah Yarborough, who was killed on her high school campus in Federal Way, Washington, in December 1991. The King County Sheriff's Office has circulated two composite sketches of a possible suspect -- a man in his 20s at the time with shoulder-length blonde or light brown hair -- but had been unable to put a name to the sketch. In December, though, the department sent the DNA profile to California-based forensic consultant Colleen Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick compared the profile to others in genealogy databases and found the closest match was to the family of Robert Fuller, who settled in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1630 and had relatives who came over before him on the Mayflower. While the descendents of Robert Fuller are likely to number in the thousands after nearly 400 years, geography and physical characteristics can help detectives narrow their search, Fitzpatrick said. In fact, Fitzpatrick said, since the DNA trace follows male descendants, there was ""a high degree of probability"" that the man police are looking is named Fuller. ""The most important thing is having a last name,"" Fitzpatrick told CNN. ""People get excited about having a Mayflower connection, but the most important thing is having a probable last name for this guy."" King County investigators disclosed the test results Monday. Fitzpatrick said the DNA she used came from one of several major collections of genetic profiles, a practice she said was ""really hot these days for genealogy."" She said the people who donated DNA profiles to the database had either done their genealogy or had their DNA tested to trace their connections. ""It allows you to connect with relatives you can't trace through traditional documentation,"" she said. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Sara Yarborough was killed in December 1991 .

"Menlo Park, California (CNN) -- The search feature on Facebook has traditionally been pretty limited. You type in a name of a person or a business, and it pulls up their Facebook page. But that's about to change. On Tuesday, Facebook introduced an upgraded search tool, called Graph Search, that will scour the massive social network to answer more sophisticated questions. Want to find buddies of your pal Chris who went to Stanford and live in Chicago? No problem. People who like tennis and live nearby? Here you go. How about photos of Berlin from 1989? Done. ""This is one of the coolest things we've done in a while,"" Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a press event at the company's headquarters. Since it became a public company last year, Facebook has been under pressure to launch exciting new products, especially for mobile, that will help boost its floundering stock price. CNNMoney: Yelp stock falls 8% on Facebook Graph Search news . Facebook said Graph Search is launching immediately in beta, although users will need to get on a waitlist to gain access. The company will continue tweaking the product based on feedback from beta users, but Zuckerberg said there's no concrete estimate for how long the rollout will take. For now, Graph Search's functions will be limited. It focuses on four main areas: people, photos, places and interests. More features will be added as they are developed, Zuckerberg said. ""This is a beta product. We focused on a few use cases that we think are good,"" he said. ""Even as an early product, Graph Search is a completely new way for people to get information on Facebook."" Graph Search delves the wealth of data already inside Facebook, pulled from 1 billion profiles, 24 billion photos and 1 trillion connections. The tool indexes all of this content and works through the main search bar you're already familiar with at the top of your Facebook profile. For now there is no mobile version, it doesn't loop in Instagram, there's no API (which would allow outside developers to build related apps), and it's only in English. The searches are natural language, which means you type the question just like you'd say it: ""Friends who like cats and 'Alias' "" or ""Podiatrists in San Francisco my friends like."" You can use Graph Search to track down people you just met (""people named Rebecca who work at Chipotle and are friends with Peter""), to look for job candidates (""friends of co-workers who have been programmers), and to play yenta for your single friends (""Friends of friends who are single men and live in Los Angeles""). Other searches could be useful for business recommendations. You can find doctors, or restaurants, based on friends' endorsements. For example, if you wanted good Indian food in San Francisco, you might search for ""Indian restaurants in San Francisco liked by my friends from India."" The results pull in practical information as well, such as reviews and prices. The first concern people tend to have after any Facebook announcement is, how will this impact my privacy? Facebook says Graph Search will return only content that has been shared with you. ""We take this really seriously,"" Zuckerberg said. If you search for something outside Graph Search's purview, it will return search results from Microsoft's Bing search engine. The two companies have worked together before on integrating social search into Bing. But Graph Search probably won't pose a threat to Google anytime soon. ""I don't necessarily think that people are going to start coming to Facebook to do Web searches with this,"" Zuckerberg said. For now, the company will not be working with Google on search functions, Zuckerberg said, adding that Google is not able to process Facebook updates as quickly as Facebook users might like. For example, if you unfriend someone, you might assume they would be blocked right away from seeing your personal data. But that might take more time with a Google-powered search, he said. While the timing was the big issue during negotiations with Google, ""it may have been a symptom of a bigger strategic rift"" between the companies, Zuckerberg said.","Facebook introduces upgraded search tool called Graph Search .
Graph Search will let users search in more detail for people, photos, places and interests .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In 2008, as the financial crisis reverberated around the globe, Allan Chau worried how his business manufacturing parts for the auto industry would weather the downturn. But the Hong Kong-based factory owner didn't look for ways to cut costs or hire a management expert. Instead, he consulted a feng shui master, who recommended moving the factory gate from the south side to the west. ""A lot of people went bankrupt that year but our sales doubled,"" says Chau, the general manager of Tien Po Precision Manufacturing. Chau, who has been consulting feng shui masters for two decades, embodies Asia's embrace of the old and the new in its approach to doing business. He has an advanced degree in engineering from Cornell University in the United States and employs 1,400 at a company that turns over $2 million a year. Despite Western skepticism, for him feng shui is an essential business tool. ""I only believe in numbers but I have an open mind,"" says Chau. An ancient Chinese system of boosting your luck through the positioning of objects and of predicting fortunes through dates and traditional texts, feng shui -- literally wind water -- is used in a variety of different ways. Shopping malls, office towers and casinos across Asia draw on its principles in their design in an attempt to create prosperity. And individuals often consult feng shui masters to decide on the best date to get married, give birth or move house. Chau says feng shui masters have helped him solve a variety of problems that have cropped up at his company, and, in some years, he has spent up to $100,000 on consultations. Most recently, he sought advice on a staff issue after a number of long-serving technicians working at his factory in China left on bad terms. In a bid to get the compensation laid-off workers are entitled to, the technicians started turning up to work and doing nothing. Chau said he had little choice but to fire them and pay up. Fed up, he asked his feng shui adviser to pay a visit. He told Chau the toilet door faced the main entrance and the bad air flow meant people did not leave happily. ""He said why don't you build a wall to block the air flow,"" said Chau. ""After the change, I didn't pay a penny more,"" he said. At the behest of various feng shui masters, Chau has also changed the color of the blinds in his conference room from green to milky white and added an aquarium to his office. However, he has so far resisted advice to move his Hong Kong head office from its current location: ""That's talking about real money."" Kerby Kuek, the feng shui master who helped Chau with his staff problem, says that 60% of his clients are businesses. The run-up to the Lunar New Year, which this year began on February 10, is Kuek's busiest time as clients want their ""annual audit"" to maximize their good fortune in the year to come. Before meeting the client, he will study their office floor plan and log onto Google Maps to form a better understanding of the building's location. ""Feng shui deals with the natural environment. We try to harness the kind energy and avoid unkind energies,"" he says. His advice ranges from the office layout to the right color of staff uniform to changing light bulbs and fixing cracked tables -- particularly if they are located in the southern corner of the office, which signifies fire and passion. He will also vet potential staff by looking at photos and birth dates. A person born in the summer months of a Snake year is best suited to back office work, says Kuek, referring to one of the 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac. ""Whereas if you are born in the year of the Bull, born in winter, these people need to be out front meeting people and being aggressive,"" he adds. Kuek is down-to-earth and his language is peppered with terms from his day job -- selling stocks and shares for an investment bank. His background in finance makes corporate clients more comfortable and none of his co-workers find his sideline strange, he says. Watch: Feng shui in Hong Kong office buildings . Kuek's clients also include multinational companies that find they have to take matters like feng shui seriously as they expand in Asia. For example, auction house Sotheby's only began work on its new office space in Hong Kong last year after a feng shui master chose an auspicious date. And in Sydney, the Star City Casino has added a ""feng shui awning"" as part of a $760 million redevelopment. Dr Michael Mak, from the University of Newcastle in Australia, studies how feng shui can be used in urban design and architecture from what he calls a scientific stand point. He says there is ""soft data"" in the form of surveys and interviews that suggests buildings that adhere to feng shui principles make their occupants happier -- be it a shopping mall, office block or a hospital. And he points to the popularity of atriums or courtyards that bring the natural environment into a building as one way the principles of feng shui are manifested in modern architecture. Mak is skeptical of the cosmic claims of ""popular"" feng shui and says it's an area that needs to be looked at more critically. Feng shui advice does not come cheap and there have been a number of scandals involving unscrupulous practitioners. Kuek charges HK$10,000 ($1,300) for a consultation for an office under 200 square foot and up to HK$50,000 ($6,500) for a 2,000 to 5,000 square foot office. Chau says he has come across some bad masters. One adviser told him to paint his office walls black. Another pedaled expensive feng shui objects. Despite this, Chau has not been put off and will be making an appointment to see how he and his business will fare in the Year of the Snake.

"(CNN) -- She's got some of the softest hands in the business. But just because jockey Rosie Napravnik has a gentle touch, doesn't mean she's a push over. Quite the opposite. The 25-year-old is a lean, mean, riding machine. And this Saturday she plans on wrapping those tender palms around the most coveted trophy in U.S. horse racing. Could this be the first female to win the Kentucky Derby in the 139-year history of the race? Ahead of the ""Run for the Roses"" -- the first race in the American Triple Crown -- Napravnik remains cautiously optimistic. ""I'm very physically fit. I'm strong. I'm not just a little string bean female that weighs 100 pounds -- and that's why I ride horses,"" she told CNN. ""I think my horse Mylute is going to be a live longshot. He's very laid back, he's not bothered by much, so the crowds shouldn't get to him -- he's definitely the type of horse that you want to have in a race like this."" Gender game . The young woman from New Jersey isn't just the most successful female jockey in the country -- she's one of the best jockeys full stop. Napravnik is the fifth-highest earning jockey on the circuit today, last year amassing a fortune of more than $12.4 million in prize money. In 2012, her horses finished in the top three in nearly half the races she entered. Not that Napravnik is immune to playing on her gender to help raise her profile in this male-dominated sport. ""For a female jockey it's a little bit harder to get yourself established. But once you can get over that hump and prove that you're a competitive rider, and win races, it's irrelevant what gender you are,"" she said. ""To be honest, the female aspect has worked to my advantage in a lot of respects -- just with publicity and being recognized for things that I've accomplished which may not have been such a big deal if it was just another male jockey."" Childhood dreams . Napravnik was exposed to horses from a young age -- her father worked as a farrier, while her mother trained event ponies. But it wasn't until she stumbled across an old video of the Triple Crown as a youngster, that she discovered racing. ""I saw this video called the ""Jewels of the Triple Crown"" on VHS -- I didn't have television so I would just watch this video over and over again,"" said Napravnik. ""I was just inspired by it and that's when I decided I wanted to win the Triple Crown."" At seven-years-old, Napravnik followed her older sister into pony racing -- seen as a training ground for wannabe jockeys. Her sister eventually left the track, but Napravnik pursued her Triple Crown dream and by the time she was 16-years-old was working as an apprentice jockey. ""Learning how to ride when I was so young, learning how to communicate with horses, has given me a great foundation in horsemanship,"" she said. ""It's a stereotype to say that all female riders are finesse riders. A lot are. But there are also men that have that finesse factor as well."" Dedication . Like many jockeys, Napravnik's rise to the top has gone hand-in-hand with a punishing routine. She's suffered five major accidents and taken a total 15 months off work due to injuries. But the talented young rider shrugs off the risks as just a part of the job. ""I don't think about the danger factor,"" she said. ""It's something I've had a lot of experience in and I try to avoid it as much as I can. A typical day involves waking up at 5am and competing in up to 12 races late into the evening. It's only after her day's work is done, that Napravinik will have a meal, such is the pressure on jockeys to meet strict weight restrictions. Family ties . It can be difficult balancing a grueling career and social life. But once she finishes smashing the record books, Napravnik hopes to pursue another dream -- starting a family. ""There's still a lot of things that I want to accomplish in my career so I'm going to try and get all of that out of the way first -- my husband and I are very excited about having a family."" But first things first. There's a Kentucky Derby to be won -- and Napravnik might just be the woman to do it.","America's most prestigious horse race, Kentucky Derby, kicks off this Saturday .

"(CNN) -- America's right place is at the vanguard of the quest for freedom and equality. The country was founded on that principle, as a nation whose very identity is built on equal rights and true freedom for its citizens. Wednesday's twin decisions by the Supreme Court in favor of gay equality allowed the country to move closer to its founding ideals. That is not just good news for gay Americans, for their families and for the United States. It is excellent news for the cause of freedom and equality around the globe, and not just for gay people. What happens in the U.S. matters. It influences views everywhere. That's why when the high court ruled that the federal law perversely named the ""Defense of Marriage Act"" or DOMA is unconstitutional and allowed the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in California to be struck down, the news rippled to all corners of the world. You can be sure the news brought smiles to faces in the Middle East, in Africa and elsewhere. The U.S. is hardly the first country to have laws and court rulings in favor of equality for gays. In fact, America has fallen far behind in what is now a worldwide movement -- and there is a very long way to go before gays in America can claim they are treated equally, if only by the law. The Netherlands was the first country to fully legalize gay marriage. It did it without much fanfare in 2000. Since then, more than a dozen countries have followed suit. Gay couples have marriage equality in all corners of the world, not just in liberal Scandinavian nations such as Denmark and Norway, but also in Latin America -- in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay -- and as far away as South Africa and New Zealand. Most of the world, however, is not as open to equality. Â As recently as last year, Iran executed young men by public hanging. It is one of several countries where homosexuality is punishable by death. In many other places, the punishment is prison. In many more, there are intense legal and social restrictions. In Uganda, the names and addresses of gay activists have been published in the local media, triggering violent attacks, and a pending law would impose life imprisonment for gays and up to three years for anyone who knows and fails to report homosexuals. American evangelists have promoted the crackdown. In Russia, just this month the Russian parliament passed a lawÂ banning ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations."" Gay rights demonstrators have been brutally beaten in what has almost become a ritual in Russia and elsewhere. Despite intense and often well-founded criticism of the United States and complaints that its rhetoric doesn't match its behavior, America wields enormous social, cultural and political sway around the planet. The court ruling on same sex marriage will be read carefully by some jurists in some countries. Its words may find their way to other rulings. Â . Other people will read just a few key words. The DOMA decision by Justice Anthony Kennedy centered on one of the most fundamental concepts of democracy: the notion of equal protection. The ruling articulates an idea that will resonate in the many nations struggling with internal divisions and just learning the meaning of democracy and freedom. Kennedy spelled it out. A government cannot simply deny equality; it cannot treat one group of people differently without a legitimate purpose. Most people will only see a headline. They will see pictures of celebrations in the United States. They will hear that in the United States gay couples can now marry. That is not quite correct. In most U.S. states same-sex couples cannot marry, although some experts believe the language of the Kennedy decision provides the arguments that will soon make that possible. Kennedy, the court, the activists and lawyers who brought these decisions may not have thought much about the rest of the world when working on this case. But the whole world was indeed watching. The whole world started watching a long time ago. More than 300 years ago, Thomas Jefferson appealed to an international audience when he wrote the Declaration of Independence. In the very first paragraph he said ""respect to the opinions of mankind"" was the reason why Americans had to spell out their decision to break free from the British. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" he explained ""that all men are created equal."" And he added that government is created for the purpose of securing unalienable rights, including ""Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness."" That is the essence of America, and it is the reason why the country has exerted such a powerful appeal to those seeking freedom over the centuries. The U.S. has very plainly strayed on many occasions from that path it so highly charted for itself. But the country has also shown a remarkable ability to correct course because its people have never become so jaded as to forget those founding ideals. One reason America has succeeded for centuries in staying at the forefront of history is that history, as Georg Hegel said, is the unfolding of an awareness of freedom. A country that stands on the side of freedom and equality is inevitably a country on the right side of history. With the two Supreme Court rulings, the U.S. edges closer to the vanguard. That's good for America, and it's a very good thing for the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Supreme Court rulings on gay rights resonate around the world .

"(CNN) -- The Boeing 777 is the mainstay of many airlines' long-haul fleets and has never been involved in a fatal accident during its service history. British Airways aircrew fly the Royal Standard from the flight deck of the Boeing 777 aircraft. The aircraft first entered service on June 7, 1995, with more than 900 suppliers from 17 countries coming together to provide the more than three million parts needed in its construction, according to the Boeing Web site. Since its inaugural flight, Boeing has extended the 777 family to five commercial passenger models and a freighter version, collectively making more than two million flights. The aircraft seats between 301 and 368 passengers in a three-class configuration and can fly distances up to 17,500 kilometers. The 777 has also won a number of design awards, as well as setting a number of records and firsts. On November 9 and 10, 2005, a Boeing 777-200LR Worldliner set a new world record for distance traveled non-stop by a commercial jetliner. The 777-200LR set a record distance of 21,601 km on a route traveling eastbound from Hong Kong to London Heathrow. The flight lasted 22 hours and 42 minutes. The achievements was recognized by the U.S. National Aeronautics Association, The Federation Aeronautique Internationale and the Guinness Book of Records. The Federation eéronautique Internationale recognized the Boeing 777 in April 1997 for achieving a speed and distance record for airplanes in its size and class. The Boeing Web site claims the 777 set the ""Great Circle Distance Without Landing"" record, traveling 20,044 km, and it set the record for ""Speed Around the World, Eastbound,"" traveling at an average speed of 889 km per hour. According to Boeing the aircraft reached 500 deliveries by 2005 -- faster than any other twin-aisle commercial airplane in history. Boeing prides itself on the 777's landing gear, which it claims is the largest ever incorporated into a commercial aircraft. Each main landing gear is fitted with six wheels, while the nose gear has two. E-mail to a friend .","The Boeing 777 aircraft first entered service on June 7, 1995 .

"(CNN) -- In Namibia, the question of who owns the wildlife has often been fraught with difficulties. In 1967 -- one year after the United Nations demanded South Africa leave Namibia -- the ruling South African apartheid government gave ownership of the local fauna to (predominantly) white landowners. Shortly afterwards, the indigenous Namibians were pushed out onto the formerly protected Kaokoveld wildlife reserve, where they were given a strip of land on which to farm. For those living on the communal lands, poaching springbok and zebra was often seen as the only way a family could stay fed. When John Kasaona was a young boy, his father did what many men did at the time; he poached. ""He used to catch everything from springbok to lion,"" recalls Kasaona. ""There was constant food in our family."" The practice was, of course, illegal, and the landowners often came down hard on poachers. ""It was a very awkward situation,"" says Kasaona. ""The colonial government's department of conservation started opening up pots in the local communities to see what was in those pots."" Though the authorities arrested perpetrators, poaching remained rampant in the 1970s and 1980s as bad droughts and a war for independence ravaged local livestock. As a result, many species in Namibia were facing extinction. ""In the private lands, wildlife was doing quite well,"" notes Chris Weaver, head of the World Wildlife Fund-Namibia (WWF-Na). ""On the communal lands, though, it was at near historic lows."" In 1983, Kasaona's father was asked by the village headman to stop poaching. From now on he would no longer hunt wildlife; he would protect it. He was one of the first poachers turned ""game guards"", in the country. The novel idea -- to protect wildlife by enlisting those most skilled at tracking it -- was the brainchild of the Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC), an NGO of which Kasaona is now the director. One of the founders of IRDNC, a conservationist named Gareth Owen-Smith, formed the idea for the game guard system in tandem with the local Herero herdsmen. ""He discovered that these elders didn't want to see the end of wildlife any more than he did,"" remarks IRDNC's co-founder, Margaret Jacobsohn. ""It might not make sense from an outside perspective, but from a local perspective, these are the men who know and enjoy being in the bush. But now they're earning an income from being there."" When Namibia gained independence in 1990, the government recognized the successes achieved by the game guard system, and enlisted IRDNC's help in rolling it out on a national scale. By 1996, the idea had matured; rather than merely paying local communities to look after wildlife, the government used ownership as an incentive. In exchange for forming a ""community conservancy"" a community was given the rights to the animals on their land. ""If people feel they really own a resource, if they feel they have responsibility for it, they're going to be accountable, and they're going to look after it,"" notes Jacobsohn. ""It's just a very logical thing. If you rent an apartment, you'll treat it one way. If you own it, you might treat it slightly better."" The initial funding came from the government and NGOs, including IRDNC and the WWF, who, with USAid, has invested $48 million into the conservancy program since 1993. Looking at the numbers today, it's clear it's been a huge success. The country currently hosts the world's largest population of free roaming cheetahs and black rhinos (where once they teetered on the edge of extinction). In the last decade, the elephant population has risen from around 13,000 to 20,000. In the northwest of the country, where lions were down to under two dozen, they now total roughly 130. The goal, though, has always been for conservancies to become self-sufficient, as owning wildlife isn't enough to ensure its protection. In order for the conservation scheme to really work, people on the land had to recognize they could benefit more from the animals alive than - as Jacobsohn says- ""in their cooking pots."" When the conservancy system started in 1996, there were four areas pulling in a negligible income. Today, there are over 74 earning a combined total of more than $4.8 million. Most of the money is derived from joint venture tourism, with trophy hunting following in at a distant second. Many conservancies have used the influx of money to better develop their local schools, provide support programs for individuals with HIV/AIDS and improve infrastructure and a range of other rural development projects. ""It brought a very big change when we went into the tourism business,"" recalls Bennie Roman, the manager of the Torra Conservancy, one of the oldest in the country, and the first to become fully financially independent. Roman recalled how before Torra was set up, the only jobs available were in teaching and farming. ""Young people would go out to urban areas, and the elders would stay back to manage the land,"" he says. In 1995, the Damaraland Camp eco-resort moved in nearby. At first, Roman says the community looked at it with suspicion. ""We saw them as competition,"" he admits. ""They were generating an income from the resources we were living with."" However since then, Torra has become the first conservancy to partner with a private business. The Damaraland Camp pays rent to the conservancy and hires locals from within the community -- one from every household. There are other effects of the conservancy program, some that don't follow strict principals of conservation. The practice of trophy hunting has proved controversial, invoking ire from various animal rights activists. Yet Weaver sees it as beneficial to preservation. ""From my perspective, we're trying to conserve the species, not the individual animal, and this creates a benefit when it's done in a well-regulated fashion, and the benefits go to the local community,"" he says. Another issue is that conservancies have done their job too well. ""The numbers of zebras and elephants have increased, but so have the numbers of lions, cheetahs and hyenas,"" notes Kasaona. ""It's become a big problem for our farmers."" Conservancies have responded in a number of ways. Most offer a small sum to farmers to offset their losses. Some use GPS tracking devices on the predators to alert farmers when they're heading over to their area. Roman has started a breeding station to help replace livestock that gets mauled by local predators. Kasaona admits that the problem is ""part of the success story of Namibia"".

"(CNN) -- The European Tour confirmed its support for a ban on belly putters Monday -- potentially placing it at odds with its rival U.S. PGA Tour -- who are opposed to the new rule change which is due to come into force in 2016. It was responding to a 90-day consultation, which was launched by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) and the United States Golf Association (USGA) after the sport's governing bodies announced their intention to outlaw the practice of putting with a club anchored to a player's stomach. At the end of last month, the PGA Tour and the PGA of America went public with their opposition to the proposals in their response to the consultation. The statement from the European Tour read: ""The European Tour has confirmed its support for the R&A and the USGA and their proposal for rule 14-1b - the prohibition of anchoring any club when making a stroke under the Rules of Golf."" But chief executive George O'Grady revealed that there had been opposition to the change among the 15-strong members of its Tournament Committee. ""Our members support the unique role played by the governing bodies in formulating the Rules of Golf."" he said. ""Additionally, virtually all of our Tournament Committee and player representatives support the proposed rule even though they are aware, and have taken into account, the fact that some members and especially our senior members use the anchored method."" O'Grady's PGA Tour counterpart Tim Finchem said last week that it was ""not in the best interests"" of golf for the proposed change to be implemented. He added: ""In the absence of data or any basis to conclude that there is a competitive advantage to be gained by using anchoring, and given the amount of time that anchoring has been in the game, that there was no overriding reason to go down that road."" While supporting the ban, O'Grady said he respected the PGA Tour's stance. ""We understand the points put forward by the PGA Tour and the PGA of America and respect and sympathize with their views, which are based on their experience and the evidence before them, and have been expressed with great concern for the game. ""The whole issue has received far greater focus and comment in the United States than in the rest of the world, perhaps because of the numbers of their golfers using the anchored method, and the set up in general terms of their golf courses and the firmness and speed of their greens."" The issue of the use of long-handled belly putters was drawn into sharp focus by the success of golfers such as American Keegan Bradley, the first to win a major using the technique, and veteran South African Ernie Els, who claimed the British Open last year after switching to the method. The top two golfers in the world, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, have both spoken in favor of a ban. If the respective major tours were to go their own way it could lead to a situation where players could use different putters in events on either side of the Atlantic. It would not be the first time there was a divergence in rules on equipment. European Tour events, including the British Open, used a smaller diameter ball of 1.62 inches against the bigger 1.68 inches diameter ball adopted in the United States, until it was outlawed by the R&A in 1974, bringing about eventual worldwide standardization. An added complication in the belly putter row is the support of the USGA for the proposed change, meaning the U.S. Open, which it runs, would join the British Open, promoted by the R&A, in outlawing anchoring. But the U.S. PGA Championship, which comes under the auspices of the PGA Tour, would allow it.","European Tour supports ban on long-handled belly putters .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton will start Sunday's German Grand Prix from the front of the grid after a stunning lap at the end of qualifying on Saturday at the Nurburgring. The Briton's time of one minute 29.398 seconds saw him finish 0.103 seconds ahead of Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel to the delight of his German-owned team. ""We were so far off this morning that we took the set-up back to where we started, tried to analyze everything and just worked really hard to improve it. I'm so grateful for the work the engineers and mechanics did for me, and it's all down to them really,"" Hamilton said. Reigning world champion Vettel has yet to win his home grand prix is upbeat about his chances on Sunday. ""We had a good run yesterday looking at the race, so I think we have done our homework. We have put the car on the first row; it wasn't quite enough for pole position, but we should have a good race from there tomorrow,"" Vettel said. His teammate Mark Webber finished qualifying in third ahead of Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen and Romain Grosjean. Fernando Alonso, who is currently 21 points behind Vettel in the drivers' championship, will start in eighth. Germany's Nico Rosberg, winner at Silverstone last weekend, will start Sunday's race down in 11th place after a misjudgment by his Mercedes team who didn't send him out for a second timed lap at the end of Q2. ""I didn't see it coming and we just underestimated how much the track would ramp up in terms of grip and lap time. I could have been on the front row today and that's why I'm so disappointed,"" Rosberg said. There were no tire problems on Saturday following six blowouts at the British Grand Prix last weekend. The Grand Prix Drivers Association has threatened to boycott Sunday's race should a repeat of last weekend's six blowouts at Silverstone occur.

"(CNN) -- I started to see influenza-like illnesses starting roughly around mid-December, and within a week knew that 2013 was going to be a bad year. In my 12 years of practice in Chicago, this flu season definitely ranks as one of the worst I've seen. However, I also see no reason to be alarmed that we have a public health threat. What we are dealing with is a well-known virus. This outbreak is worse than average due to, more than anything, poor timing. There are three main factors to consider in evaluating the intense flu activity across the country. One is the virus itself. Both the medical community and the general public alike worry someday we will encounter a ""superbug."" We fear a virus that is extremely potent at causing disease, replicating, resisting our treatment and killing the host. Though the predominant strain this year may be slightly more potent than average based on the number of cases we are seeing, there is no indication that this virus is markedly different from what we've seen in other years. Opinion: Next time, get vaccinated earlier . The percentage of influenza-related deaths is not higher than in previous outbreaks. The CDC also has found no viral strains this season that are resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors, the drugs that we use to treat patients once they develop the flu. So, we need not worry too much about the virus. The second factor to consider is the effectiveness of the flu shot. This year's flu vaccine is well matched to the strains of flu that have been circulating. According to the CDC, more than 90% of the identified viral types are covered by the current vaccine. In other words, we cannot blame an ineffective vaccine for the bad outbreak. Finally, we need to look at environmental factors. The unusually warm weather this winter should not be contributing to the severity of the outbreak. Why? Because last year, it was also unusually warm, and at the time we hypothesized the weather was partly responsible for a milder than normal flu season. Clearly, warm weather can't both enhance and suppress the spread of influenza. Instead, we must focus on what's different from previous years. Unlike last year, when the flu showed up late, this flu season came early. Most importantly, the peak incidence of illness happened to coincide almost exactly with the onset of the holiday season, which is critical to take into account. If someone were trying to develop a way to disseminate an illness, he would first devise a way to weaken the population's immune system, and then bring people together to spread the disease. In essence, that is what the holiday season does. Opinion: America flunks its health exam . Because of holiday preparations and parties, people tolerate less sleep. Stress around the holidays generally goes up. Combine those with poor eating habits and overindulgences that are typical in festive times, and the immune system gets weakened. Once a person contracts the flu virus, he or she is contagious approximately 12 to 24 hours before the peak onset of symptoms, and is often contagious up to 24 hours after resolution of fever. During this very social time of year, many of these sick people are either tolerating their symptoms to join big groups of friends or family, or coming together honestly unaware that they are contagious. As a result, we have the perfect storm for the spread of influenza. In sum, our flu season this year is simply a product of poor timing. Health: Your top flu questions answered . The peak onset of the flu just happened to coincide with a period when we have weakened our immune system and congregated in large gatherings to, among other things, disseminate disease. There is no supervirus. The flu strains have been well anticipated and carry no resistance to our treatment. We have no reason to panic. I recommend that everyone de-stress from the holiday stresses, wash their hands, eat healthy, exercise and get plenty of sleep. Stay home if you are sick. And in good time, this too shall pass. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Zich.","David Zich: This flu season definitely ranks as one of the worst I've seen .

"(CNN) -- Many Americans were stunned when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study last month showing that suicide now kills more Americans than car accidents. But as a primary care doctor, I am not surprised. Over the past decade, the period in which suicide deaths spiked, I have witnessed how the U.S. health care system approaches the treatment of depression. It is outdated and ineffective, and it too often fails at protecting Americans from the consequences of mental illness. With each passing year, the U.S. falls further behind other countries in finding cost-effective ways to care for our citizens' mental health. On Monday, President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are holding a conference at the White House aimed at broadening access to mental health care and removing the stigma from seeking treatment. They have their work cut out for them. Depression is a leading cause of disability in the U.S. Most people with depression will see a primary care doctor before they see anyone else. We physicians are supposed to identify depression, help patients get the right treatment, and prevent suicide. But every time I see a patient with depression, I feel my hands are tied. Yes, I can prescribe an antidepressant and adjust the dose, but many depressed patients also need psychotherapy, more intensive medication management, and close follow-up. I cannot get them all the treatments they need. In the U.S., mental health treatment is largely delivered by specialists who are not integrated into primary care clinics. It is reimbursed separately, often with restrictions on the number of visits and at a high cost to patients. The best I can do with a depressed patient who is not responding to initial treatment is to say, ""I can give you a referral, but you need to check with your insurance company to see if it will pay for this."" Often the patients do not follow through -- either because the wait time to see a mental health provider is too long, they cannot afford the treatment, or they are simply too depressed to act on the referral. The World Health Organization projects that by 2030, depression will be the leading cause of disability in the world, with huge economic and social costs. Even some developing countries are surpassing the U.S. in creating innovative and effective ways to deal with this coming tide. The U.S. Mental Health Parity Act, passed in 2010, requires insurance companies to provide equal coverage for mental health and may improve depression care for Americans. The Affordable Care Act will also expand mental health benefits to 62 million more Americans by including mental health as an Essential Health Benefit and by mandating mental health parity within the health insurance exchanges. However, in light of ongoing state budget and sequestration cuts, mental health services continue to erode. In April, for example, the Democratic governor of Maryland revoked $7.2 million in funding for mental health. As shocking as this was to mental health advocates, policymakers across the country -- even in comparatively liberal states like Maryland -- are arguing that in the face of other urgent and competing priorities, strengthening the mental health system is too expensive for states to pursue. But that wouldn't be true if we consider alternative, more cost-effective delivery models. In a rigorous study in Uganda, which has very scarce resources, researchers trained community members to deliver group interpersonal therapy to depressed men and women in 30 villages. The groups met weekly for four months. During the meetings, participants shared their experiences, and the group leader facilitated support and suggestions for change from other group members. This approach dramatically reduced the percent of people in the study with depression, from 80% to 28%, and improved people's ability to do the things that matter most, such as taking care of their children and themselves, going to work, and socializing. Countries such as Pakistan and India, which have huge populations and many competing economic and social priorities, are also experimenting with task-shifting, in which mental health counseling can be delivered by lay health workers trained to provide scientifically sound counseling with supervision. The benefits go beyond cost reduction. Studies in India show that lay health workers also help people to better accept mental illness and necessary treatments. To be sure, some mental health innovation can also be found in parts of the U.S.  Project ECHO, partly funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, is using telephone and Internet technology to link specialists at the University of New Mexico with primary care doctors, community health workers, and health educators in rural parts of the state. Through technology, specialists train and support nonspecialists in treating people with mental illness and addiction, a lethal combination that often leads to suicide. Suicide is the culmination of many complex forces. But it is often preceded by mental illness that could have been treated. The dramatic spike in suicide deaths among Americans is a stark warning to those in charge of the U.S. health care system. If the U.S. ignores the innovation and alternative delivery models that are advancing mental health care in other parts of the world, the cost will continue to be measured in American lives. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Namratha Kandula.","Namratha Kandula: CDC says suicide kills more Americans than car accidents .

"(CNN) -- Ah, the first day of spring. It conjures images of butterflies flapping through azure skies and bunnies hopping through meadows of fresh tender grass. Someone forgot to send the memo to the Northeast and Upper Midwest where some folks are digging out from up to 15 inches of snow and temperatures in some areas are well below zero. Winter isn't ready to give up yet as a lingering storm was dumping more snow across most of Maine on Wednesday, after hitting the rest of the region a day earlier. A winter storm warning remains in effect until noon for central and northwest Maine, where 8 to 14 inches of snow are expected. ""Definitely over winter,"" an exasperated David Riley of Lunenburg, Massachusetts, told CNN affiliate WHDH-TV. ""I'm ready for spring."" The town about 40 miles northwest of Boston received 15.5 inches of snow on Tuesday. ""Pretty sick (of this),"" Fran Gallagher said. ""Our house is going on the market at the beginning of April and we're getting out of here ... hopefully some place warm.""

"(CNN) -- Green Day's lead singer is seeking treatment for substance abuse, the rock band announced Sunday, two days after the performer's expletive-laden meltdown during a show in Las Vegas. The band said on its website that Billie Joe Armstrong, its charismatic frontman, would get help for substance abuse, though it did not specify the nature of his problems. The announcement follows Armstrong's on-stage meltdown on Friday during the iHeartRadio Music Festival at the MGM Grand. 2011: Billie Joe Armstrong's pants get him grounded . Video from the event, captured on YouTube, shows Armstrong cursing profusely after cutting a song short. He then goes on a profanity-filled rant, pointing to a sign indicating Green Day had only one minute left in its set, far shorter than he'd expected. ""You've got to be ... kidding me,"" said Armstrong, noting his longevity on the music scene and disparaging teen pop sensation Justin Bieber, who was not among the festival performers. ""This is a ... joke."" Armstrong then slams his guitar on the stage, shredding it and tossing its remnants into the crowd. He then flashes his middle finger and walks off the stage. Green Day references the meltdown in its website message. ""We would like everyone to know that our set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those we offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas,"" the band said. iHeartRadio is a division of Clear Channel Broadcasting. It wasn't clear how the development would affect Green Day's upcoming tour, which is set to kick off in earnest November 26 in Seattle, though the band did say it ""regretfully must postpone our upcoming promotional appearances."" Nor is it known how it might affect NBC's singing talent competition, ""The Voice,"" on which Armstrong had been slated to be a mentor to participants. Armstrong was rushed to a hospital in Italy earlier this month ""due to illness,"" Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt said then in a video posted on the band's website. After forming in 1987, the veteran punk band broke through in 1994 with the release of ""Dookie,"" which sold 15 million and earned the band a Grammy for best alternative music performance. Green Day continued to produce hit albums like ""Insomniac,"" ""Nimrod"" and ""Warning."" In 2004, the band took another major step forward with the release of ""American Idiot,"" which won a Grammy for best rock album and inspired a ""rock opera"" years later by the same name. The rockers remained relevant in subsequent years, including capturing yet another Grammy in 2009 for the politically charged album ""21st Century Breakdown."" The band is set to release yet another album, ""Uno,"" on Tuesday. That will be followed by two others, ""Dos"" and ""Tre,"" scheduled to come out November 13 and January 15, 2013, respectively. 2010: A fan's take on 'Green Day: Rock Band'","Green Day's lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong is getting help for substance abuse, the band says .

"(CNN) -- The president of the South African Football Association (SAFA) has been suspended as part of an investigation into match-fixing ahead of the country hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2010. Kirsten Nematandani and four other SAFA officials were suspended as an act of ""good governence"" following a report by football's global governing body FIFA, which adjudged four friendly matches ahead of Africa's first World Cup had been fixed. According to the FIFA report, the results of South Africa's matches with Thailand, Bulgaria, Colombia and Guatemala were prearranged for the benefit of convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Perumal and his Football 4U organization. Nematandani declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Last year, Perumal was imprisoned in Finland after a court ruled that he had arranged the outcomes of at least seven league matches from 2008 onwards. The Singaporean was also heavily implicated in the match-fixing scandal that affected South Africa's neighbors Zimbabwe between 2007-2009, a process which has had repercussions for nearly 100 footballers while two former national coaches have been banned. The timing of FIFA's report into match-fixing involving the team known as Bafana Bafana comes at a bad time for South Africa, as it is just one month away from hosting the continent's showpiece football event -- the Africa Cup of Nations. The suspensions were announced by a SAFA emergency committee on Monday, ahead of an enquiry, with vice president Chief Mwelo Nonkonyana set to take interim charge of the governing body. ""The emergency committee considered and accepted the report as received,"" read an SAFA statement. ""The emergency committee felt that the president would have to appear before the commission of enquiry to explain his role in the matter. ""Having considered the implications of this for SAFA, the committee asked the president to take a voluntary leave of absence from his position. ""All members of staff mentioned in the report who will need to give evidence at the commission are likewise put on special administrative leave pending the finalization of the enquiry, or pending receiving a clearance from the commission. ""This action in no way implies that these individuals were involved in match fixing. It is again simply for good governance that this measure is being implemented. ""The members of staff so affected are: Dennis Mumble, Lindile 'Ace' Kika, Adeel Carelse and Barney Kujane."" The SAFA was unavailable to clarify what the FIFA report might mean for South African football or what action they may take after the inquiry. The organization said last week it wanted to ""bring this unfortunate matter to a just and final conclusion."" Speaking as president -- before his suspension -- Nematandani said: ""Having cooperated with FIFA during their investigation, we are happy that this matter is coming to its conclusion and our commitment to zero tolerance to corruption is well documented. ""SAFA remains totally committed to working with FIFA to wipe out the scourge of corruption that is impacting on football globally."" Mumble is SAFA's new chief executive officer. Interim president Nonkonyama stressed how all parties involved should be considered innocent until proven guilty. ""This is a difficult situation for the Association, and for those who have been named in the report. We hope that there will be no speculation about their presumed guilt or otherwise. ""We need to allow the investigation to take place speedily and fairly, so those that are innocent can be separated from those who are not."" In a statement released last week, South African football's ruling body acknowledged that ""Perumal and Football 4U managed to infiltrate SAFA prior to the World Cup, with an offer to assist with referee development. ""The offer included providing FIFA-accredited referees at their cost for the friendly matches prior to the FIFA 2010 World Cup."" One of these games -- when South Africa beat Guatemala 5-0 in May 2010 -- featured the award of three penalties. A month later the 2010 World Cup was the first to be staged on the continent of Africa. Hosts South Africa were eliminated in the group stages, but, to the delight of African football fans, Ghana enjoyed a run to the quarterfinal. The ""Black Stars'"" campaign was eventually ended by a penalty shootout defeat to Uruguay. Spain went onto to be crowned world champions for the first time, beating Netherlands 1-0 in the final after extra-time.","South African Football Association president suspended amid match-fixing claims .

"(CNN) -- Deep inside the South African Bushveld, a thunderous lion roar pierces the air as a parade of elephants ambles quietly through the flat terrain. Somewhere in the distance, a herd of leopards lurk in a dense riverine flora, while a group of giraffes stretch their long necks to munch on tree leaves. In the middle of it all, Renias Mhlongo feels at home. ""That's where I was born, right under that tree,"" says Mhlongo, as he points out to a large ebony tree amidst the wildlife haven of South Africa's Kruger National Park. Mhlongo, 49, is one of South Africa's very few senior trackers, honing the traditional skills of trailing animals in the Londolozi game reserve. He works with fellow South African tracker and game ranger Alex van den Heever, trying to preserve the ancient tracking skills before being lost to modernity. Read more: South African comic duo stir up stereotypes . Over the years, the two men -- one black, one white -- have forged a strong friendship and working relationship that's taking them from tracking Londolozi's wildlife to traveling the world as international spokesmen for South Africa's bushveld. ""It's the connection to nature, to wilderness,"" says van den Heever of the deep bond he's created with Mhlongo. ""That's the first thing people relate to but then I think people know South Africa's history -- they know the troubles we've come through and when they see two guys, one black, one white, that have connected on such a deep level, they like that and that shows South Africa has a lot to offer,"" he adds. Armed with uncanny intuition, Mhlongo spent all his childhood in the bush, herding and protecting his family's cattle from the lions, often on his own. Growing up there, he got to listen to, read and understand the signs of the bush in a way that few can. ""When I grew up here, I sit quietly, listening to the different sound of animals, the sound of grasshoppers, the sound of the lion -- all that is part of my growing in nature because here, we don't have cell phones here, which makes me connect to the nature,"" says Mhlongo. ""If you come from a town, it's very difficult to spot things ... but I was born here and I use my passion to listen to everything, to try to spot something,"" he adds. See more: 'Green Nobel' winner fights to save Africa's rainforests . Today, Mhlongo and van den Heever use their vast knowledge and experience to pass on their Bushveld wisdom to younger generations. Together, they have started a tracker academy offering a year-long course in the skills Mhlongo learned as a youngster. ""It seeks to restore the indigenous knowledge that was once a part of our landscape,"" says van den Heever. ""There's only four or five authentic, genuine Bushman trackers left, so it (tracking) is dying and if you consider the formal qualifications, there are only 19 senior trackers in South Africa -- of which there are only five senior tracker evaluators and only three master trackers left,"" he adds. ""So the bottom line is we're losing them and within 10 years if nothing is done we could have seen the last of the traditional trackers."" Read more: The Africans giving aid to the world . The two men also hold training workshops and travel the world to give talks and coach people on what they can learn from the South African bushveld, as well as encouraging conservation. Mhlongo says he is passionate about teaching his valuable skills to aspiring trackers. ""It is very important to share the knowledge with other people, to give them the same skills like we have,"" says Mhlongo. ""The tracking skill is something dying because no one wrote books on how to track animals, so we try to bring it up again.""","Renias Mhlongo and Alex van den Heever are South African game rangers and trackers .

"(CNN) -- A record number of rhinos have been killed this year in South Africa, fueled by the belief that their horns can cure cancer. An unsubstantiated belief on their healing powers is spreading in southeast Asia, sending clients paying top dollar for traditional cures, officials said. So far, 455 African rhinos have been killed this year, according to government officials. A total of 448 rhinos were killed last year. ""It is critical for the South African government to engage with consumer countries and to fight against international syndicates involved in illegal rhino horn trade,"" said Dr. Jo Shaw, rhino coordinator for the WWF in South Africa. One of the nations linked to the trade is Vietnam and a collaboration action between the two against illegal rhino horn trade remains unsigned, according to Shaw. ""There is also an urgent need for law enforcement actions by neighboring countries implicated as transit routes for illegal trade in rhino horn,"" the coordinator said. Conservation group Save the Rhino estimates that there are 25,000 rhinos in Africa.  Of those, about 21,000  live in South Africa, the group says. ""Rhino numbers continue to grow in South Africa as more rhinos are being born than are dying, even when poaching mortalities are taken into account,"" Shaw said. ""However, we are approaching the critical tipping point where rhino numbers go into decline and would undermine conservation efforts."" South African officials say they have arrested nearly 200 people linked to the trade, including about 20 who allegedly serve as couriers.","So far, 455 African rhinos have been killed this year, officials say .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN)  -- Protesters took to the fabled Brazilian beaches of Copacabana on Tuesday to draw attention to the 9,000 people they say have disappeared in Rio de Janeiro since January 2007. Dummies represent victims of violence in a protest Tuesday on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro. The group ONG Rio de Paz staged a cemetery on the sand, with mannequins representing those who have been slain and secretly buried. Demonstrators also constructed facsimiles of ovens that narcotics traffickers and death squads reportedly use to cremate remains of those they have abducted. ""In general, they are assassinated by police,"" said Antonio Carlos Costa, president of ONG Rio de Paz,  ""police acting outside of their regular work hours. They are also assassinated by narco-traffickers. The bodies are disposed of in secret cemeteries in the metropolitan Rio de Janeiro area or incinerated alive by narco-traffickers in what they call 'microwaves.' "" Costa pointed out there was a great outcry when 138 political activists disappeared during Brazil's military dictatorship from 1964-'85. Now, he said, 9,000 people have disappeared solely in Rio de Janeiro in less than two years and ""no one says anything."" He attributed the apathy to the fact that most of the victims are poor and live on the outskirts of the city. Jackeline Munoz, an investigator with the public security department at Candido Mendez University, said the figure of 9,000 disappearances was obtained from official documents published by the Rio de Janeiro governmental Institute of Public Security. Costa said he believes about 6,000 of those who disappeared were killed, many by drug traffickers fighting for territory in Rio's slums and poor neighborhoods. Others, he said, were killed by hit squads and police acting on their own. ONG Rio de Paz will conduct an investigation next year, Costa said.","Protesters stage cemetery on Rio beaches with mannequins as victims of violence .

"(CNN) -- Beasts of burden, winners of wars and beloved as the sport of Kings -- now horses are being used to cure the ills of modern life. From the time ancient Egyptians worshiped feline deities, animals have been viewed as a source of strength and healing. Renowned psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud believed dogs helped his patients relax during sessions, while the Soviets used dolphins to treat people with mental health disorders in the 1980s. Today, rabbits, guinea pigs and even the humble gold fish are used to promote a sense of responsibility and wellbeing everywhere from the classroom to the retirement home. And an increasing number of mental health patients are turning to horses as a legitimate form of therapy -- claiming impressive results where traditional counseling has failed. No longer viewed as simply a crackpot alternative remedy for the rich and famous, equine therapy has gained a devoted following of psychoanalysts who say it has the power to heal people suffering from depression, bipolar disorder, phobias, anger issues and trauma. ""It used to be seen as ridiculous, an airy fairy treatment used by celebrities with drug and alcohol addictions,"" said Mike Delaney, clinical director at Leading Equine Assisted Therapy (LEAP), based in Gloucestershire, south west England. ""But attitudes have changed a lot. We're now a part of the British Association for Counseling & Psychotherapy (BACP) for example."" The wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney helped boost equine therapy's public profile this year when she revealed it helped her overcome depression, after being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis 14 years ago. Ann Romney, who co-owns a horse which competed in the London 2012 Olympic dressage competition, told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that horses had motivated her to get out of bed, even in her darkest days. Across the pond, equine therapy is going from strength to strength, with the Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA), originally based in the U.S., training more than 1,500 therapists in Britain last year. The UK arm says they are now seeing hundreds of new inquiries, compared to just a handful a few years ago. Patients include domestic abuse victims, young offenders and servicemen suffering post traumatic stress -- often turning to their four-legged friends after finding traditional counseling failed them. Equine Assisted Therapy (EAT) usually involves the patient interacting with a horse, alongside a professional councilor and horse handler. Activities might include discussing the horse's character, teaching them to jump over obstacles, grooming and cleaning out stables. ""For a woman who has been a victim of domestic violence, getting the horse to run around her in a circle, may seem simple, but it's a very powerful thing,"" Delaney, also clinical director at the Bayberry Clinic in Oxfordshire, in south east England, said. ""Building a relationship with the horse and getting it to respect them, really builds self esteem and confidence."" For people who find traditional psychoanalysis too intense, equine therapy can be a way of opening up dialogue with a councilor. ""The thought of sitting in a room opposite a councilor and telling them the same story again is too much for some people, particularly children,"" Delaney said. ""But when a horse pays attention to them, they get that sense of trust and love back. It enables traditional therapy to happen, rather than being its own thing."" However, scientific evidence of its effectiveness remains thin on the ground, and is mostly anecdotal. ""I've never heard of a medical referral for equine therapy,"" Psychotherapist Robin Walton, a member of the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP), said. ""But factors such as being outside and freed from the confines of an office could be tremendously beneficial for the relationship between the patient and therapist."" Delaney recently completed a study in which 40 teenagers from sexually abusive backgrounds were treated with equine therapy once-a-week. The youngsters, aged between nine and 14-years-old, undertook horsemanship training and counselling as part of their eight-week treatment. ""The change in their behavior was tangible,"" Delaney said. ""The first week they were looking at the ground, too scared to interact with people. ""By the end of the last week they were hugging people, dealing with their anger and managing their emotions."" For patients coming from traumatic home lives, the fresh air of the great outdoors and chance to socialize, are just as much a part of the healing process as the horses themselves, added Delaney. A 14-year-old girl who was able to overcome her agoraphobia -- a fear of being in public places - was also highlighted by Dr Hannah Burgon, managing director at Sirona Therapeutic Horsemanship in Devon, south east England. ""She had a love of horses, which was the motivating factor for getting her to leave the house,"" Dr Burgon said. ""It helped her build up a relationship with the psychotherapist and work through a lot of issues."" ""She's now able to go on shopping trips with her mother and recently went on her first family holiday."" However, therapy doesn't come cheap, with a 90-minute session at Sirona costing Â£82, usually run once-a-week over a six-week course. The healing power of horses goes back to an age-old relationship with man, according to Burgon. ""We've got this innate connection to horses. They've been our transport, our friends, our beasts of burden, we've won wars on them,"" she said. ""They've very social animals and the emotional part of their brain is very large. But there's also a powerful element to them. They're not domestic like dogs or cats, they're born wild and have to be tamed. You have to earn their trust."" For some people who have come up against hardship, equine therapy may be just the thing to help them get back in the saddle of life.","Throughout history, humans have relied on animals as a way of improving mental health .

"(CNN) -- The top dogs ruled the world's most famous hot dog eating contest, once again. Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest is always a big event, drawing thousands to Brooklyn's Coney Island to cheer on some of the world's most accomplished competitive eaters. But this year's edition proved extra special for historical, dramatic and sentimental reasons. Making history was Joey ""Jaws"" Chestnut. The San Jose, California, resident was no stranger to the Coney Island contest before he won his seventh hot dog-eating title Thursday. That's cumulative and consecutive, as he's won each of these events since 2007. But it's how he did it this time -- topping his own record by gobbling 69 frankfurters and buns in 10 minutes -- that proved one for the record books. His 69 downed dogs is the most by anyone since the competition began in 1916, and one ahead of the 68 mark he'd set last July 4 as well as in 2009. ""Sixty-nine is the magic number,"" Chestnut told ESPN, which broadcast the event. ""Came out here, the crowd pushed me, they would not let me slow down. And it's awesome"" While there was no doubt Chestnut would win after he pulled away to top his nearest foe by 19 hot dogs, the same couldn't be said for the women's event. Every bite counted as Sonya ""The Black Widow"" Thomas and Juliet Lee dueled down to the wire. When the clock ran out, the scoreboard had it as a tie -- 36 hot dogs apiece. But the judges tipped the scales in Thomas' favor, ruling that the Alexandria, Virginia, resident had gorged on 36ยพ hot dogs. That was ยพ more than Lee, enough to give Thomas her third title despite the fact her final tally was far below the 45 hot dogs she put away last Independence Day. Still, Thomas and Chestnut's championships were significant as much for where they took place, as for what they did. Parts of Coney Island, on Brooklyn's southern coast some 12 miles south of Lower Manhattan, were ravaged eight months ago when Superstorm Sandy rolled through. Scores of businesses and backdrops that tens of thousands associate with summer fun suffered major damage there and in other places, like the Jersey Shore. Yet the hum of amusement park rides and the buzz of the throngs packing to cheer on Chestnut, Thomas and others on Thursday is proof that, for one day at least, Coney Island is back.","Joey Chestnut wins 7th Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest in Coney Island .

"(CNN) -- The rainy season is a good time to go to Costa Rica. It's a lot cheaper and there are far fewer tourists. My visit was from July 22 to 31. Even if there is a lot of rain, chances are that it will come down during your afternoon nap and clear up just in time for cocktail hour at 5:30 p.m. Getting in and around Costa Rica . The trip began with my flight into the San Jose area, which is where my Costa Rican host and friend, Jose, lives. Another friend visiting from the States picked me up and immediately, on the short trip from the airport to their home, we were confronted by the strange, small, bad roads and terrible driving that would be a theme for the entire trip. Jose made us wonderful ceviche -- also a theme -- when we arrived, and we chatted about how Congress or President Obama would solve the debt deadline. The next morning we set off. We rented a car for the week, a Toyota Yaris, which we immediately noted had pretty bad brakes and a clutch that seemed to have little life left in it. We headed out of the city to Arenal Volcano, one of the country's most popular tourist attractions for its activity and nearby hot springs. We stopped at La Cascada for lunch in the tourist town La Fortuna, which is at the base of the road around Arenal. Then we continued around Arenal. The volcano, as it often is, was obscured by clouds. Usually at night one can see the glowing lava, which sounded pretty cool. We thought of stopping for the evening in one of the resorts lining the base of the volcano, some of which are luxurious, but we decided to push on to the west coast. We stopped briefly at the seemingly out of place German/Swiss chalet Los Heroes, which is a hotel and fondue restaurant, but our timing was off for either lunch or dinner. Experiencing the coast . We explored Coco Beach quickly but found it to be a little too noisy and busy. So we went one beach up to Hermosa and quickly found the Villa Acacia, which had clean, spacious villas, beautiful grounds and a nice small round pool. It seemed to be frequented mostly by Costa Rican families. Hermosa Beach lived up to its namesake (beautiful) the next morning. The water was calm, warm and clean. This was some of the best swimming we had the entire visit. Just swimming casually we saw a skate shark and a puffer fish. Couple escapes it all for 'paradise' in Costa Rica . The next day we spent driving a considerable distance to Playa Carmen, on the southern tip of the Nicoya Peninsula. This drive was not for the faint of heart and had it been rainy, it could have been a dangerous, life-threatening drive. There were times when the going was steep and rocky. There were times when the driver was screaming in terror. The wear and tear on the car's brakes and clutch were starting to make a lot of sense. Even traveling fairly short distances in Costa Rica should be considered carefully, because sometimes -- and by sometimes, I mean often or always -- there is a bridge out, necessitating a long, slow reroute. Sometimes potholes are so omnipresent that you have to travel at 10 mph for hours, even in a rental car. Unless you know the condition of a road, you can assume that you can make about 20 miles in an hour. But the difficulty is worth it. Playa Carmen was beautiful and full of young, fun people from all over the world. There's excellent surfing there. We saw the most amazing sunset from Carmen, one of those where the sun dips into the water at an alarming speed. From Carmen we spent the next day traveling to Playa Samara, where we spent four nights in the wonderful and small Fenix Hotel, which had its own spot right on the beach. Innkeeper Bill was friendly without being intrusive or obsequious. He keeps a lame squirrel as a pet, so you know his heart is in the right place. The six-unit hotel has a small pool, beach furniture and clean, comfortable suites with kitchens -- including high-quality Osterizer blenders. They know what they're doing there. Also, a highlight was the rare Mercedes Unimog that Bill has parked out front. We were very excited to see that and on the last day, Bill let us play with it. Zip lines and hatching turtles . Another highlight was the amazing Wingnuts Canopy Tour, which I would highly recommend. We swept between peaks on zip lines to see views of the ocean. We heard a variety of birds and saw a blue-crowned motmot, one of the most amazing birds I've ever seen. Our guides, brothers Manu and Yasha, were warm, smart people who loved nature. They also set us up with a guide to the nearby nature refuge at Rio Ora, where we went the next night to see green sea turtles lay eggs on the beach. These 4- to 5-foot-long turtles lay between 100 and 150 eggs in the sand before lumbering back into the sea. Conservationists guard the eggs from poachers, who are pretty aggressive and sometimes dangerous. The experience was another highlight. We returned to Alajuela to spend two nights at my friend's family's house. No trip could be complete without a trip up to Poas to see coffee plantations, beautiful views, and the slumbering but active volcano and gorgeous Botos Lake. Lunch on the mountain is recommended at Chubascos Restaurant, where we had the most amazing strawberry drink -- fresas en leche (strawberry in milk). The local strawberries are wonderful in Poas, better than any I've ever tasted. 'La Pura Vida' Then it was back to the airport and a five-hour flight back to New York. I loved the Costa Rican refrain ""La Pura Vida,"" which means ""Pure Life."" It's sometimes used sarcastically, like when yelled at a passing motorbike. But its honest meaning is taken to heart in Costa Rica. The land is pure, the people are healthy. Wildlife is revered and respected. They watch ""Animal Planet"" in all the bars and restaurants. The people have good health care and the best free education system in Latin America. They seem happy, what can I say?","Driving through Costa Rica not for faint of heart, but the peril is well worth it .

"(CNN) -- Derrion Albert was different from the other boys in the often violent and tense neighborhood of Roseland in South Side Chicago. Derrion Albert, 16, was beaten to death last week. His death was captured on video. ""He had a different attitude. And I'm not saying he was perfect, but when you ask him to turn his hat to the back or take it off, he wouldn't put it on the back or hang it off his head or say to you, like the other boys do, 'F**k that!' He would just do what you asked,"" Ameena Matthews said. Matthews works with Cease Fire, a Chicago, Illinois, grassroots organization founded in 1995 to try to curb gang violence. She grew up in the neighborhood that has drawn national attention since a video captured Albert, a 16-year-old honor student, being beaten to death with a railway tie, kicked and punched by other teens. Four have been charged. Their ages are 16, 17, 18 and 19. Two went to Christian Fenger Academy High with Albert. It's unclear who videotaped the savagery. Matthews is a mediator, which means kids come to her and tell her that a dispute is about to boil over into violence; she picks up the phone and calls the two sides and talks it out. Last school year, Albert complained to her that some boys were threatening him and that his leather jacket and shoes had been stolen from his locker. ""That boy tried. He complained to his teacher; he complained to me,"" she said. But Albert, like many kids, hung out with some of the same boys who were known to menace other children in the neighborhood. That's the way it is, she said. You hang out with who lives in your neighborhood. ""Kids are not going to say, 'Oh, this kid is a gangbanger. I better stay away.' All of them want to be friends with the kid who lives next door or in their project. ""People outside who don't understand this neighborhood want it to be simple, and it's not simple. No kid is really bad or really good. It's complicated over here. You need to find you some security and come here and see what it's really been like for years. ""Because it's war in this neighborhood,"" she said. ""Nobody really safe. Boys got lot of guns.""  Watch graphic video of the attack » . ""I think [gangs] tried to recruit him, and he said no, and he just tried to go home, and they just jumped on him,'' the Rev. Victor Grandberry, who met with Albert's family after Thursday night's killing and is acting as their spokesman, told WGN-TV. The Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday that teenagers are scared to go to school or to be in school. Parents are yanking their kids out of Fenger. Albert's grandfather, Joseph Walker, told CNN affiliate WLS-TV that his grandson was a good kid. ""He was in Bible class this Tuesday night. Church on Sunday,"" Walker told WLS. ""I have no trouble out of my grandson whatsoever. This thing that happened to him is so horrific that we just don't know what we're going to do. We lost a really dear friend in my grandson. He was a blessed child."" The teenager had been living with his sister's grandmother for the past two years but recently moved in with a cousin, according to the grandmother, Eunice Cross. Cross and Matthews both said his mother lives in Mount Vernon, in southern Illinois. His mother is expected to arrive in Chicago on Tuesday. Cross told WGN that Albert has another sister and a brother. Cross said Albert had lived with her on and off since his grandmother died.

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's long wait for a major soccer title ended on Sunday as the ""Super Eagles"" beat Burkina Faso 1-0 in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations. Sunday Mba scored his second goal of the two-week tournament -- both coincidentally coming on the day that bears his name -- as Nigeria became just the fourth team to win the continental crown three times or more. ""I'm so happy it is a dream come true. I don't know what to say,"" Mba said after the final whistle. ""We really worked hard and we were looking forward to this day and I'm so happy for this."" Stephen Keshi became only the second man to win the title as both coach and player, having been captain at the 1994 tournament when Nigeria won for the second time -- though he did not play in that final. Burkina Faso, playing in the final for the first time, missed out on the $1.5 million first prize and the chance to represent Africa at this year's Confederations Cup in Brazil. Mba also scored in the quarterfinal win over tournament favorites Ivory Coast, being one of five home-based players brought into the squad by Keshi. Keshi made big changes after Nigeria failed to qualify for last year's event in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon -- a turbulent period for the national team, which was suspended from international football by President Goodluck Jonathan before world ruling body FIFA threatened to intervene. However, the president was delighted with Sunday's result. ""President Jonathan thanks coach Stephen Keshi and all members of the team who have worked very hard to make Nigeria the proud champions of Africa once again after 19 years of setbacks in the competition,"" his office said in a statement. ""The President also believes that having conquered Africa, the new Super Eagles can go on to achieve even greater glory at the World Cup in Brazil next year."" Back in 1994, Nigeria was ranked fifth in the world -- the highest by any African nation. The Super Eagles won gold at the 1996 Olympics, but have since slipped to 52nd in the rankings. Mba's 40th-minute strike came after a moment of opportunistic skill as the 24-year-old flicked a loose ball into the penalty area and then poked a volley past the Stallions' goalkeeper Daouda Diakite. ""It will go a long way towards my career,"" said Mba, who made his first appearance at the tournament after winning a late call-up from Keshi. ""This is my first time and I'm very happy. We gave all that we had.""","Sunday Mba scores the only goal of the Africa Cup of Nations final in South Africa .

"(CNN) -- Home to Africa's highest mountain and one of its most famous wildlife parks, Serengeti, Tanzania is one of the continent's most popular tourist destinations. It was recently listed by the New York Times as its number one place to go in Africa, with 783,000 visitors in 2010, according to a World Bank report published in 2012. It is the largest country in East Africa, has abundant wildlife, 500 miles of coastline and 15 National Parks. The United Republic of Tanzania was formed in April 1964 by the union of mainland Tanganyika and the Zanzibar archipelago. The archipelago consists of two large islands -- Zanzibar and Pemba -- and numerous smaller ones. Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa at 5,895m, is one of seven Tanzanian sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Another is Serengeti National Park, known for its annual migration of two million wildebeests and hundreds of thousands of gazelles and zebras - followed by their predators. The migration is described by UNESCO as ""one of the most impressive nature spectacles in the world."" Read related: Safari in Tanzania . The spectacular Ngorongoro Crater, the world's largest caldera, is part of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, a UNESCO heritage site listed for its natural and cultural significance. Other UNESCO sites are Selous Game Reserve, listed for its natural beauty; Kondoa Rock-Art Sites, the Ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani and Ruins of Songo Mnara and Stone Town of Zanzibar, all listed for their cultural significance. Of these, the Ruins of Kilwa Kisiwani and Ruins of Songo Mnara, the remains of two great ports booming between the 13th and 16th centuries, located on islands off the coast of Tanzania, is listed as a site in danger. Alongside the natural attractions, Tanzania has a rich culture, both traditional and modern. Watch Zanzibar music legend Bi Kidude still singing into her 90s . Zanzibar International Film Festival, also known as the Festival of the Dhow Countries, is East Africa's largest arts, design, music and film festival, with most events in Zanzibar's historic Stone Town. Last year the festival attracted 150,000 visitors, including 7,000 from abroad, and included a race of traditional dhow sailing boats. For a more traditional cultural celebration, MaKuYa Festival in the Mtwara region has been held every year since 2008, bringing together hundreds of traditional dancers and cultural events. One of the country's longest-running festivals is the Bagamoyo Festival, held each year since 1982 by TaSUBa, formerly the Bagamoyo College of Arts. The TaSUBa Theatre, where it is held, is the largest performing arts venue in East Africa, and attracts musicians performing African music from reggae to roots to jazz. An annual charity Goat Race held each year in Dar Es Salaam is based on a concept from Uganda and has raised more than 500 million Tanzanian shillings ($320,000) for charity over the past 11 years. Read related: Why Tanzanians believe in witchcraft . Tanganyika and Zanzibar had gained independence from Britain in 1961 and 1963 respectively. Julius Nyerere, a key figure in the fight for independence, became the first president of Tanganyika in 1962 and remained head of Tanzania until 1985. His successor, Ali Hassan Mwinyi, started a gradual process of economic liberalization and democratic reform and in 1992 the constitution was changed to allow for multiparty competition, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The current president President Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete has been in power since 2005 and was elected for a second term in 2010. Today, although Zanzibar is part of Tanzania, it has its own parliament and president and a growing movement for full independence. Ismail Jussa, a local politician, said: ""Right now there's a grand movement, not just both political parties of Zanzibar, religious groups, civil society organizations, members of academia, student organizations, all of us have come together to say it's high time Zanzibar sovereignty is restored and Zanzibar should be able once again to be in charge of its own destiny and plan its own future."" The Tanzanian people are split roughly equally in their beliefs, between 30% Christians, 35% Muslim and 35% with traditional beliefs, according to the CIA World Factbook. In Zanzibar, the population is more than 99% Muslim. Most of the country's population is Bantu, consisting of more than 120 tribes, including Sukuma, Nyamwezi, Chagga, Masai, Haya and Gogo. The commercial center is Dar Es Salaam, with a population of 3.6 million in 2011, according to the United Nations Population Division. The agency said that currently 12 million of Tanzania's 45 million population live in cities, and 33 million in rural areas. However, it predicted that both the rural and urban populations will have grown to 69 million by 2050. Despite its growing tourist industry, Tanzania is one of the world's poorest countries, with an economy that relies heavily on agriculture and employs 80% of the population, according to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The average life expectancy is just over 53 years, with the world's fourth highest death rate from HIV/AIDS, the CIA World Factbook said.","Tanzania has Africa's highest mountain, 500 miles of coastline and 15 National Parks .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has a smile on his face again -- and not just because of his perfect record at this week's ATP World Tour Finals. At the start of last week, the Serbian tennis star was battling with the news that his father had been taken seriously ill. It badly affected his preparations for the Paris Masters, and he lost his opening match. Srdjan Djokovic was hospitalized with a reported acute respiratory condition, but his condition has since improved -- which has allowed his son to find focus for the $5.5 million season-ending event in London. ""Well, it was hard. It still is, but there is good news every day,"" said the world No. 1, who lost his grandfather in April just hours before playing a match in Monte Carlo. ""That makes me happier, makes me play more relaxed on the court. I switch off on the tennis court. I try to think only about the match and it's been working well so far. ""Every win means a lot for my family and me. But there are more important things in life, and that's health. I guess that's the priority now."" Djokovic is through to the semifinals of the elite eight-man tournament following Friday's 6-2 7-6 (8-6) victory over sixth-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych, which gave him a 100% record in three Group A matches. As he did in Wednesday's win over world No. 3 Andy Murray, Djokovic was forced to battle hard and he saved three set-points to prevent the match going to a decider. ""I played a really good match but I thought he served better towards the end of the second set. I was fortunate to come back and win in straight sets,"" said Djokovic, who ended Berdych's hopes of repeating last year's progress to the semifinals with his 11th win in their last 12 encounters. It took him to 73 match victories this year, equaling the leading mark set by David Ferrer. Djokovic won the tournament in 2008 its final staging in Shanghai, but last year failed to qualify out of a group including Berdych. He ran out of steam following a breakthrough season in which he toppled Rafael Nadal from the No. 1 ranking and claimed three of the four grand slam titles. Berdych will now look forward to next week's 100th Davis Cup final, where he will lead his country against Spain. Murray also made it through to the last four in London, beating Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2 7-6 (7-3). The U.S. Open and Olympic champion needed only to win the first set to go through, following Berdych's defeat, and did so with few problems before Tsonga made a match of it. Murray and Djokovic must wait for Saturday's Group B results before finding out who they will play on Sunday. Wimbledon champion Roger Federer has already secured a semifinal place, but the result of his match against Juan Martin del Potro will decide who tops the group. World No. 5 Ferrer -- who has a tour-leading seven titles this year -- can also go through if he beats Janko Tipsarevic and defending Federer wins his third successive match.","Novak Djokovic reveals that his father's condition is steadily improving .

"(CNN) -- British intelligence hasn't broken any laws in sharing data with its American counterparts in counterterrorism efforts, Foreign Secretary William Hague said Sunday. ""The idea that in GCHQ people (British intelligence) are sitting working out how to circumvent a UK law with another agency in another country is fanciful,"" Hague told the BBC, referring to Britain's communications intelligence agency. ""It is nonsense, and I think that I can give people that assurance."" GCHQ is the acronym for Government Communications Headquarters, a British intelligence agency. Hague spoke after a week of revelations about the scale of data-gathering by GCHQ's U.S. counterpart, the National Security Agency. Britain's the Guardian reported Saturday that GCHQ had access to an American data-mining system known as PRISM, suggesting it could ""circumvent the formal legal process"" required to seek personal data under British law. Hague didn't confirm or deny whether British intelligence received information from the American programs. But the United States and Britain have shared intelligence since World War II, and Hague said British law ""provides for intelligence-gathering that is authorized, necessary, proportionate and targeted -- targeted on what we really need to know."" NSA leaker comes forward . ""The net effect is that if you are a law-abiding citizen of this country, going about your business and your personal life, you have nothing to fear -- nothing to fear about the British state or intelligence agencies listening to the contents of your phone calls or anything like that,"" he said. ""Indeed, you'll never be aware of all the things those agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen and to stop a terrorist blowing you up tomorrow. ""But if you are a would-be terrorist or the center of a criminal network or a foreign intelligence agency trying to spy on Britain, you should be worried, because that is what we work on,"" he continued. ""And we are, on the whole, quite good at it."" How does it affect me? Wednesday, the Guardian disclosed a secret order from a U.S. intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19. Thursday, the Washington Post and the Guardian disclosed the existence of PRISM, reporting that the program allows NSA analysts to extract details of customer activities -- including ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials -- from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms. In the wake of the revelations, the U.S. government declassified some details of the programs and defended the programs as both legal and valuable to heading off the threat of terrorism. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Saturday the surveillance programs are ""conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress."" ""In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context -- including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government,"" Clapper said. Data mining revelation opens political Pandora's box . U.S. officials said earlier that phone-call data isn't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terror, and only then on the authority of a judge. Officials say analysts are forbidden from collecting the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas. And President Barack Obama tried to reassure Americans about the programs Friday, saying, ""Nobody is listening to your telephone calls."" Clapper's office called PRISM ""an internal government computer system used to facilitate the government's statutorily authorized collection of foreign intelligence information from electronic communication service providers under court supervision."" It was created in 2008, targets ""foreign targets located outside the United States"" and gets reviewed by the administration, Congress and judges. ""There is not a target on Americans,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters Sunday. ""There has to be a non-U.S. person believed to be on foreign soil. That is a huge difference than what is being portrayed in the media,"" said Rogers, R-Michigan. But Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who's long called for greater transparency in how the government collects data on Americans, said the legal authority should be reopened for debate after last week's disclosures. Some shrug at snooping: Privacy's already dead . ""Maybe Americans think this is OK, but I think the line has been drawn too far towards 'We're going to invade your privacy,' versus 'We're going to respect your privacy,' "" Udall told CNN's ""State of the Union."" Udall is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, have criticized the scope of the classified programs that allow the collection of Americans' phone records -- but have been limited in what they could say publicly. Udall told CNN that claims that the monitoring has thwarted terrorist attacks are overblown. ""It's unclear to me we've developed any intelligence through the metadata program that's led to the disruption of plots that could have been attained through other means,"" Udall said, pushing back on assertions by both administration officials and Republican Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers that a specific plot was stopped using the massive collection of phone records.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge sentenced a former commercial pilot to six months in prison Friday, followed by six months of home detention, for being intoxicated while co-piloting a domestic flight, a federal prosecutor announced. Aaron Jason Cope, 33, was found guilty in June of operating a common carrier under the influence of alcohol. He could have been ordered to serve as many as 15 years in prison and pay a fine of as much as $250,000. U.S. District Court Judge John R. Tunheim, who oversaw the two-day bench trial, laid out a less-stringent sentence for Cope on Friday morning. After his initial year in prison and home detention, the sentence includes two years of supervised release. Cope was ordered to report to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to begin serving his time by January 3, according to a statement from John Walsh, U.S. attorney for the District of Colorado. ""The public rightly expects that airline pilots will not drink and fly,"" Walsh said. ""Because flying while intoxicated is a serious crime and puts the lives of passengers and people on the ground in danger, we will prosecute it swiftly and effectively -- every time."" Cope was the first officer aboard United Express Flight 7687 on the morning of December 8, 2009, as it flew from Austin, Texas, to Denver. United Express is the name under which several regional airlines operate flights for United Airlines. Flight 7687 was operated by Shuttle America, a subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings. According to court documents, the flight's captain, Robert Obodzinski, testified that although his co-pilot ""appeared to be thinking and speaking clearly, every few minutes during the flight (Obodzinski) detected an unusual odor, which he eventually concluded was the smell of an alcoholic beverage."" When the plane arrived in Denver, Obodzinski testified, he ""leaned over and took a big whiff"" and determined that the odor was coming from Cope. Cope had been the ""monitoring"" pilot on the flight and thus had not manipulated the plane's controls. However, he was scheduled to fly the Embraer 170 aircraft on the next flight. The Embraer 170 has a seating capacity of 70 to 80 people. Once Cope returned to the cockpit after conducting a post-flight inspection, Obodzinski reportedly told him, ""if you have any problem taking a Breathalyzer, call off sick and get out of here."" Cope then replied, ""Well, I guess I better call off sick then."" Obodzinski, who had been on the phone with superiors while Cope was doing the inspection, was directed by his company to escort the co-pilot to an alcohol testing facility in Denver International Airport's main terminal, according to trial documents. There, Cope's blood alcohol content was found to be 0.094%, more than twice as much as the Federal Aviation Administration-prohibited level of 0.04% for any crew member of a civil aircraft. Republic Airways prohibits any crew member from working with a blood alcohol level above 0.02%. At the testing facility, according to testimony, Cope admitted that he had gone to a bar with a friend and bought beer from a gas station near the hotel where he, Obodzinski and two flight attendants had stayed the previous night.","Aaron Jason Cope must serve 6 months in prison and 6 months of home detention .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's oldest son, Prince, compared putting the singer's shoe and glove imprints in cement at Hollywood's Grauman's Chinese Theatre to accepting a Grammys lifetime achievement award two years ago on behalf of his late father. ""For me, and I think I speak for him as well, this right here is his lifetime achievement award,"" Prince Jackson said. ""This is what he strived to get."" Prince and brother Blanket pressed a pair of their dad's shoes into wet cement, while sister Paris used one of his famous sequined gloves to create an impression. All three children added their own handprints in a ceremony on the Hollywood Boulevard sidewalk Thursday. ""It's a very good celebration and I know if Michael was here he would agree, to see all his friends and loved ones, and especially his fans here to celebrate this with him,"" family matriarch Katherine Jackson said. It was part of the promotion for Cirque du Soleil's ""Michael Jackson The Immortal World Tour,"" which makes its Los Angeles debut Friday night. Quincy Jones, who produced Jackson's best-selling ""Thriller"" album, and Smokey Robinson, who called Jackson ""my little brother,"" spoke, but there was little doubt Paris Jackson, 13, was most excited about her chance to introduce teen pop star Justin Bieber. ""I know my father would've wanted to be a mentor to someone like him, and would be very proud that he came to today's celebration,"" Paris Jackson said. Michael Jackson is his role model, inspiring him to be the best he can be, Bieber said. ""I want to have that perfection, I want to, you know, be the best I can be, that's what Michael did,"" Bieber said. ""He always wanted to be the best he could be."" Jackie Jackson said that a 300-pound block of cement with his brother's footprints and signature, found in the basement of a closed Las Vegas hotel just before it was torn down, would be placed on the Grauman's forecourt next to the imprints created Thursday. It was created in 1994 for a Las Vegas walk of fame project ""that never materialized,"" he said. ""Michael, we miss you,"" brother Tito Jackson said. ""There's hardly a day that goes by without him going on in mind somehow, some way, and I know that he is here today with us. That's for sure."" Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson have been more public in recent months in contrast to their lives before their father's 2009 death, when they were shielded from public view. The children attended the Canadian premiere of the traveling Cirque du Soleil show with their grandmother in October. The ""Immortal"" show is touring the United States and Canada through this year before taking up residency in Las Vegas. Show biz legends who left their handprints and footprints in Grauman's concrete courtyard on Hollywood Boulevard include Fred Astaire, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Sidney Poitier, Clark Gable and Mary Pickford.

"(CNN) -- ""What time of day do you think we should be open?"" veteran public relations executive Marian Salzman asks her staff. ""10, 10:30,"" comes the response from several 20-something employees, along with a few giggles. Salzman isn't about to keep the doors closed until 10:30 a.m., but she's listening. The chief executive officer of Euro RSCG Worldwide PR has been doing plenty of listening to her staff of about 80. The vast majority of them are members of the millennial generation -- born after 1980 -- and some of their requests might be considered audacious by executives many years their senior. Millennials at Euro RSCG have asked for free food, which Google offers; a juice bar; a yoga/Pilates room; even reimbursement for a personal trainer. Saltzman didn't grant any of those perks, but she understands that they may not seem outrageous for someone with a millennial mindset. ""They want the workplace to recognize that they're not 9-to-5 people. They're not people that are ever going to wear gray flannel suits,"" Salzman said. For many millennials, the priority is, ""life first, work second."" ""I have a girlfriend. I have family. I have friends. And these are all things that are very important, because we work to live and not the other way around,"" Euro RSCG staffer Greg Housset said. As millennials play an increasingly important role in the work force, their likes and dislikes are changing the way America works and forcing a growing number of executives in a wide range of industries to change policies and management style. Millennials have seen their parents laid off and burned out by corporate America, so life/work balance is especially important to them, management experts say. ""If you want to get the best people, you have to meet them halfway,"" said Robert DelCampo, associate professor at the University of New Mexico's Anderson School of Management. ""Being inflexible won't get you anywhere."" So, Euro-RSCG does permit very casual dress: Tattoos are on display, as are toes sticking out of flip-flops. The company sponsors rooftop happy hours three days a week, offers half-day summer Fridays and gives time off for volunteer work. Hiring director Allison Pinter recently returned from a six-month volunteer stint with Yele Haiti in the aftermath of the country's devastating earthquake. ""I'm really lucky I got to do that and then come back to the job that I've loved for five years,"" Pinter said. Salzman feels it's best not to manage from an authoritarian position. Rather, she strives to be a leader, peer and student of her young employees. Why? Because they are plugged into the social media revolution that is changing the way the world communicates, including corporate America. ""They're the new marketplace. They're the new brains. They come with all the social media tools and tricks embedded in them as natives,"" she said. The public relations veteran recognizes that she needs to be flexible enough to accommodate as many requests as possible from her young staffers, requests she says she wouldn't have dared made when she was starting her career in the early '80s. Managing millennials requires executives to check their egos and build up a thick skin. Not only are young employees demanding, they're quick to voice criticism, even online for the world to see, something Salzman has experienced. But she's put aside inclinations to exert her power in favor of recognizing the potential of her young employees, who she argues are anything but slackers. ""You're not the smartest person in the room anymore. You may be the most experienced. You may be the wisest. You're not the smartest,"" she said. It's paid off for Euro-RSCG Worldwide PR. The firm has enjoyed strong growth under Salzman, with clients including Kmart and pharmaceutical firms Sanofi and Bayer.

"(CNN) -- Australia edged the British and Irish Lions 16-15 in Melbourne Saturday to set up a thrilling climax to their three-Test series next weekend. The home side, who lost the first Test in Brisbane, trailed for most of a match of ferocious intensity until Adam Ashley-Cooper crossed for a late try. Christian Leali'ifano, drafted in by the Wallabies after poor kicking cost them dear last week, duly converted to leave them a single point ahead. The Lions mounted a desperate late attack to rescue the situation and with the clock going past the regulation 80 minutes won a penalty from just inside their own half. Full-back Leigh Halfpenny had the right direction with his effort but it fell a few meters shot of the posts to leave Australia to savor a revenge win. They will go to Sydney next week looking to repeat the events of 2001 when the Lions also lost in Melbourne before Australia won the decider 29-23. Lions coach Warren Gatland refused to blame Welshman Halfpenny for his late failure from long range. ""I've seen him kick them from there before. He just didn't strike that one well enough. Just a chance to be a hero in that moment,"" he said. ""Hes obviously disappointed with himself, but he still kicked incredibly well. ""He's such a professional. He realizes the significance of that kick at the end and he's just disappointed he missed."" The Lions led 12-9 at halftime, all their points coming from the ever reliable boot of Halfpenny with penalties, his only miss another from distance which struck the crossbar between the posts. Leali'ifano kept Australia in touch with three assured penalties of his own in a match of few try scoring opportunities. Halfpenny kicked the Lions into a six-point advantage with a further penalty after the interval, but the surges of Wallabies new boy Israel Folau set them up for their decisive try. It was reward for their greater invention and Ashley-Cooper took full advantage from close range. ""Very proud. It doesn't get any bigger than that. They knew the context,"" said Australia coach Robbie Deans. ""They knew that if they weren't successful in scoring a try and converting, the series would be done,"" he added.","Australia beat British and Irish Lions 16-15 in second Test .

"(AOL Autos) -- The main ""ups"" of buying a used car are the lower initial purchase price, as well as lower property taxes (where applicable) and insurance costs. The main ""downs"" of buying a used car are that it's a used car, not new -- so there's no new car warranty and you are more vulnerable to used car problems that could cost you money, as well as aggravation. To reduce your risk of exposure when you buy a used car, there are a number of precautionary steps you can take when shopping for a used vehicle. These tips to buy a used car include: . Shop for newer used cars that still have at least a portion of their original manufacturer's warranty remaining: Most late model used cars have at least three-year/36,000 mile basic warranty coverage (and often longer ""powertrain"" coverage on the engine and transmission). This means you'll get at least a year or so of peace of mind if you buy a used car that is less than three years old. (Important: Be sure to confirm the used car warranty is fully transferable.) Check into Certified, Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicles: These are late model used cars and trucks that typically have less than 50,000 miles and have been given multipoint inspections -- with any needed service or upkeep taken care of before the used car is put on the lot. CPO programs are backed by the automakers (Ford, GM, Volvo, etc.) and the vehicles often include a no-cost extended warranty on major parts such as the engine and transmission. CPO used cars are usually clean and well-maintained -- the ""cream puffs"" of the used car market. Do a ""background check"" for indications that the particular used car make/model you are considering might be a problem car: One with an unusual record of either recalls or consumer complaints. You can find information about recalls and safety-related defects at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Web site (www.nhtsa.dot.gov), and information about consumer satisfaction at JD Power & Associates (see www.jdpower.com/cc/index.jsp ). Consumer Reports is another good place to poke around (go to www.consumerreports.org/main/home.jsp and click on ""autos""). It's also a very good idea to do a simple Google or Yahoo! Web search; just type in the make and model of the vehicle and ""lemon."" You can bet if the car has a history of problems, there will be complaints all over the Internet. Screen your candidate -- the specific used car you are looking at: Even if the make/model has a great reputation for quality and reliability, that particular used car may not have been well-maintained -- even abused. Have a third-party mechanic (not one working for the dealer) look the used car over as a condition of sale. If the dealer refuses to permit this, you should consider yourself well warned -- and walk away. Ask to see the used cars' service records: If these are available, it's usually a good sign the car was well cared-for, and perhaps more importantly, proof (if the records are complete) that there weren't any unusual repairs or problems. If the used car records are not available, you should be suspicious. It doesn't necessarily mean the used car is a bad car, but you have to wonder why the seller would not have kept such a strong selling point as evidence of proper upkeep and maintenance. In such a case, it is doubly important to have a mechanic you trust give the used car a thorough once-over before you commit to buy. Be sure it will pass both state safety and emissions tests (where applicable): In most states, this is a legal requirement, but don't assume it is. It can cost hundred of dollars (or more) to repair a used car that fails either state safety or vehicle emissions testing -- and in many cases, you can't legally register or drive that used car until it does pass. Lastly, jot down the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN): Located on a stamped plate on the top of the used cars dashboard, and run a CARFAX Vehicle History report to check for used car deal-killers such as evidence of a prior accident, odometer fraud, manufacturer ""buy back"" (a lemon) and so on. A CARFAX report costs less than $25, and is well worth the expense. As far as specific recommendations, here's a short list of some historically ""good bets"" when it comes to buying used cars or trucks: . I. Economy Cars: . Toyota Corolla -- The gold standard of new economy cars is also, predictably, an excellent choice in a used car. In addition to a well-earned reputation for high quality and durability, Corollas are among the safest cars in this class -- and offer features such as antilock brakes and side-impact air bags (on newer models). Corollas also hold their value exceptionally well -- to such an extent that a used Corolla you buy today for $6,000 will very likely still be worth four or five thousand dollars two to three years down the road. II. Luxury Sedans: . Lexus LS400/LS430 -- New, these large rear-drive, V-8 powered luxury sedans cost tens of thousands less than an equivalent Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Jaguar. As used cars, they continue to perform flawlessly -- without giving their owners high blood pressure years after other luxury makes become expensive money pits. The LS series sedans are considered bulletproof -- and also have one of the lowest depreciation rates in the business. Acura RL -- A conservatively elegant large luxury car that, like the Lexus LS, enjoys a reputation for absolutely superb engineering and quality. Unlike the Lexus LS, however, the Acura RL is a front-wheel-drive luxury sedan -- so it offers better grip in the winter, if that's a concern where you live. And it is powered by a V-6 engine rather than a large V-8, so its appetite for gas is more agreeable. III. Large Family Cars: . Ford Crown Victoria/Mercury Marquis -- These six-passenger sedans are hugely roomy and immensely rugged (one reason they're favored as police cars/taxis/limos) and very safe -- consistent 5 Star performers in government/insurance industry crash testing. These are also the only late model sedans that offer standard V-8 power and rear-wheel-drive in a full-size chassis for the price of a V-6 powered, front-drive, midsize sedan. IV. Pickups: . Nissan Frontier -- Tough, capable and exceptionally trouble-free small pickups, the Frontier offers both economical but tough 4-cylinder engines and more powerful V-6 engines. Look for used 4x4 models with manual locking hubs. Though it requires the driver to stop the vehicle, get out and manually engage the front hubs by rotating a knob in the center of each front wheel, these 4x4 systems tend to be more durable and problem-free in the long haul than the electronic/automatic hubs used on most new pickups. V. SUVs: . Toyota 4Runner -- Considered by serious off-road drivers to be one of the best vehicles for this job (due to its agility, suspension and comparatively narrow body), the 4Runner consistently scores well when it comes to long-term durability and used car resale value, too. VI. Minivans: . Honda Odyssey -- Though pricey relative to other vans, the Odyssey is considered the benchmark vehicle in this class -- for features as well as overall design. Excellent used car resale value and top of its class occupant protection are additional reasons to consider an Odyssey. Toyota Sienna -- Another Toyota product that's got an established track record for high quality and a low incidence of significant problems, defect or recalls. Siennas are offered in a variety of configurations, including models with full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD).","Buy used cars with original manufacturer's warranty remaining .

"(CNN) -- The city of Berkeley, California, is trying to stop the U.S. government from closing a medical marijuana dispensary and filed a federal court claim Wednesday, attorneys said. In the latest strategy against federal attempts to shut down marijuana shops, the city contends the U.S. civil action would harm the city by depriving it of hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes, paid over a period of years, according to Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit group whose attorneys are representing the city. In May, the U.S. government filed a complaint for forfeiture against a property leased by the retail marijuana store Berkeley Patients Group at 2366 San Pablo Avenue in Berkeley, according to court papers filed by U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag. 5 things to know about marijuana in the U.S. The federal complaint asserted the dispensary was illegally selling marijuana, which under federal laws is a controlled substance, court papers said. Also, Haag noted that the dispensary was operating within 1,000 feet of two preschools, the complaint said. The dispute over the Berkeley dispensary is an example of the legal conflict between the federal government and local marijuana clinics that are legal under some state laws such as in California, said Amanda Reiman, a policy manager for the alliance in San Francisco. Berkeley city officials also asserted the importance for cities to regulate local marijuana clinics without federal interference. ""It is time for the federal government to wake up and stop these asset forfeiture actions,"" Mayor Tom Bates said in a statement. ""Berkeley Patients Group has complied with the rules and caused no problems in the city. The federal government should not use its scarce resources to harass local law-abiding businesses."" More than two weeks after the federal forfeiture complaint was filed in May, the Berkeley City Council passed a resolution stating that the dispensary operators ""contributed significantly to our community, providing good jobs and paying millions of dollars in taxes. They have improved the lives and assisted the end-of-life transitions of thousands of patients. They have been active supporters of dozens of Berkeley community organizations,"" the alliance said. Adrian Grenier: Drug war demonizes people . Reiman said municipalities are frustrated with federal forfeiture attempts against marijuana dispensaries. Some smaller cities in California have refrained from allowing dispensaries out of fear of federal action, Reiman said. The Berkeley claim follows a similar claim filed by Oakland city officials against the U.S. government, which has filed a forfeiture complaint against Harborside Health Center, which describes itself as the world's largest medical cannabis dispensary and was featured on the Discovery Channel's ""Weed Wars"" series. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a stay in the forfeiture proceedings against Harborside, as requested by the city of Oakland, court documents said. ""I think this is something that we're going to see -- more and more cities making a push-back,"" said Reiman of the alliance. ""They're still going to fight and they can't be threatened away with landlord letters."" Meanwhile, dispensary advocates are pushing a legislative proposal in the California statehouse that would create a state regulating body over marijuana cultivation and dispensaries -- instead of leaving cities to regulate the dispensaries, said Lynne Lyman, California director of the Drug Policy Alliance. New Mexico, Colorado and the District of Columbia now have such a state regulatory system, and federal forfeiture actions haven't been seen in those states, Lyman said.","Feds file a civil forfeiture complaint to close a marijuana dispensary in Berkeley .

"(CNN) -- At least one tornado ripped through central Arkansas Thursday evening, savaging a mobile home park and sending National Weather Service forecasters into a bunker as the storm roared overhead. ""There's pretty extensive damage in the Little Rock area,"" said John Lewis, a senior forecaster with the weather service at the North Little Rock Airport. At least four people were hurt, authorities said, but there were no reports of fatalities. ""We went into our shelter,"" Lewis said. ""We could hear it ... go by."" The storm destroyed hangars at the North Little Rock Airport and tossed numerous small planes. The forecasters spent about three minutes in their shelter.

Aubrey said he saw a Douglas DC-3, an early passenger plane, spin around. The aircraft was nowhere to be found after the tornado passed, he said. The damage extended from southwest of Little Rock to the northeast. ""There's some structural damage in the city of Little Rock and several areas north of North Little Rock,"" said John Rehrauer, spokesman for the Pulaski County Sheriff's Department.

"(CNN) -- With the Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments about the constitutionality of the President Obama's health care law, more patients than ever have been asking for my thoughts about health reform. I practice primary care in southern New Hampshire near the Massachusetts border, which gives me a firsthand look at how health reform has impacted my neighboring state. Despite flaws with the Massachusetts approach, and the president's Affordable Care Act which is modeled after it, I believe that health care reform needs to move forward. Read a transcript of Monday's court arguments . Over the years, I have encountered too many cases of patients who are inadequately served by our current health care model. Some of their stories are heartbreaking, others are deeply worrisome. Some time ago, I had one middle-aged patient with diabetes, whom I'll call Mark, requiring high doses of insulin to control his blood sugar. He faithfully saw me every three months, where I made careful insulin adjustments so his sugars wouldn't go too high or low. But all of a sudden, he stopped coming. I didn't hear from him until a year later, when I received a call from the emergency department telling me Mark was found in a coma because of a critically high sugar level. Thankfully, he survived his hospital stay, and when he came for a visit afterward he explained how he had lost his job, and thus, his health insurance. He couldn't afford to see me or buy his medication. According to the 2010 Commonwealth Fund survey, 72% of jobless Americans said they couldn't afford to fill a prescription or obtain needed medical tests. Worse, 40% said that medical bills forced them into difficult financial decisions, such as depleting their savings, or being unable to pay for necessities like food, heat or rent. These are choices patients should never be forced to make. But it's not only patients without insurance who suffer. Others are in a situation like another patient of mine, whom I'll call Linda. She recently told me that her sister was diagnosed with colon cancer, a disease with a strong genetic component. I recommended that Linda have a colonoscopy. Unfortunately, her health insurance plan had a deductible in the thousands of dollars, making a colonoscopy prohibitively expensive. Last year, a study from the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, found that families enrolled in high-deductible plans like Linda's cut back on health care that was clearly beneficial, like cervical cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer screening. According to the study, ""these cutbacks could cause a spike in health care costs down the road if people end up sicker and need more intensive treatment."" The Affordable Care Act would help patients like Mark, by providing him a way to obtain affordable health insurance regardless of his job status. Beginning in 2014, health reform would expand the eligibility of Medicaid and provide federal tax credits to help buy private insurance. On average, 17% of the nonelderly population nationwide would be helped, with numbers as high as 36 to 40% in parts of Florida, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and California. And for patients like Linda, health reform would prohibit cost sharing for many preventive screening tests, including colonoscopies. My support of the Affordable Care Act is tempered, however, by a serious flaw: Its benefits cannot be fully realized without a strong primary care foundation. In the United States, the number of specialists to primary care doctors is about 70-30, a ratio that's reversed in the rest of the world. That primary care deficit is a far bigger threat to health reform than if the Supreme Court were to rule President Obama's law unconstitutional. Having health insurance doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be able to see a doctor. In Massachusetts, more than 95% of residents have health insurance, the highest in the country. However, a 2011 Massachusetts Medical Society survey found that more than half of primary care doctors were not accepting new patients, while the average wait time for an appointment exceeded one month. When you consider that health coverage will expand to 32 million Americans in 2014, whether our strained primary care system can handle that burden is a serious question. An inability to see a primary care provider will force patients to already crowded emergency departments, where health care is often the most expensive. The Affordable Care Act doesn't do nearly enough to make primary care enticing, despite the anticipated shortfall of primary care providers approaching 30,000 by 2015. Medical students, concerned by their average school debt approaching $160,000, often eschew primary care in favor higher paying specialties. And the bureaucratic burdens of primary care, including paperwork and spending time on the telephone refuting insurance company denials, are overwhelming. According to an Annals of Internal Medicine study, 30% of primary care doctors considered leaving the field entirely, citing burnout, time pressures and administrative hassles. These concerns, however, shouldn't stall health reform. Instead, they need to be addressed as the Affordable Care Act is modified and improved on in the coming years. Far too many patients can no longer afford to obtain basic care. It's their stories that have made me realize we desperately need to fix our broken health care system, and accept health reform despite its shortcomings. We cannot let the pursuit of perfection become the enemy of doing the right thing. Patients like Mark and Linda need help now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kevin Pho.","Supreme Court will hear arguments about the constitutionality of the health care law .
Kevin Pho: Despite flaws, we should go forward with the Affordable Care Act .
He says current health care system does not adequately address needs of patients .
Pho: health reform is necessary, but we also need a strong primary care foundation ."
"(CNN) -- A leftist candidate won the Czech Republic's first presidential election decided by direct vote. Milos Zeman, a former prime minister and head of the Citizens' Rights Party, won with 54.8% of the vote, according to the Czech News Agency. He defeated Karel Schwarzenberg, an aristocratic foreign minister with the TOP09 party, who garnered 45.2%. Zeman replaces Vaclav Klaus, who must step down after serving the maximum of two terms. The main issues in the election were national security, anti-corruption measures, accession to the eurozone, appointment of judges and presidential pardons of convicts, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until 2012, the parliament elected the president for a five-year term. After years of debate on the topic, fueled by allegations of corruption in the voting process, the constitution was amended a year ago to provide for direct presidential elections, according to the OSCE. In the 1990s, Zeman was Klaus' only real rival on the political scene. Schwarzenberg was personally and professionally close to late President Vaclav Havel. The Czech presidency is a largely ceremonial post, though the president plays an important role in foreign policy and government formation, according to Sean Hanley, an analyst at University College London. Both Zeman and Schwarzenberg are Europhiles. Both were willing to contemplate a government dependent on Communist Party support, opening the way for likely Communist-Social Democrat cooperation in government after the next parliamentary elections in 2014, Hanley said. CNN's Per Nyberg, Richard Allen Greene and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","Milos Zeman, a former prime minister, wins the Czech presidency .

"(CNN) -- Mark Cavendish finally had reason to smile at the Tour de France, winning the 13th stage to make up ground on Peter Sagan in the race for the green jersey. But Cavendish's fellow Brit, Chris Froome, didn't have as good of a day since main rival Alberto Contador cut into his overall lead. ""It was a difficult stage, it was a nervous stage, but finally I'm so excited to win,"" said Cavendish. ""It's been a difficult few days and it's nice to be on the podium again."" Cavendish, who won his second stage this year and 25th all time, became embroiled in controversy Tuesday when he collided with Tom Veelers as part of a sprint finish. Although he was cleared by race officials, Veelers heavily criticized Cavendish and called for him to be thrown out of cycling's most prestigious race. Cavendish was then sprayed with urine by a fan as the difficult days continued and edged by Marcel Kittel on Thursday in another sprint finish after seemingly looking in control. On Friday, though, Cavendish cruised past Sagan at the finish line. He was part of a group of racers who broke away from the pack -- Contador included -- with about 18 miles of the relatively flat 107-mile stage remaining. Cavendish said his Omega Pharma-Quick Step teammates carried him throughout the stage. ""They gave everything for me yesterday and I let them down,"" said Cavendish, now 84 points behind Cannondale's Sagan. ""Today I just sat there while eight guys rode until their legs fell off. ""I didn't really do anything today. I just crossed the finish line first. In the end it was just Sagan and myself. I was really happy to beat him."" Team Sky was unable to keep pace with the breakaway pack as crosswinds became a factor, leaving Froome behind two-time race winner Contador. Froome didn't benefit from the support of Edvald Boasson Hagen, who was ruled out of the Tour after breaking his shoulder Thursday. ""I desperately wanted to get on to the Contador move but I was sitting a little too far back,"" said Froome. ""I was just behind Cav's wheel when he sprinted across. ""I think he was the last guy to get across and again it's another reminder that this race is 100 percent open and that there is still everything to race for."" His lead of three minutes, 25 seconds shrunk, although it wasn't Alejandro Valverde in second. The Movistar rider slipped to 16th overall when he collided with another racer and damaged a wheel. Dutchman Bauke Mollema moved into second, 2:28 behind Froome, and Saxo-Tinkoff's Contador shaved a minute off Froome's advantage to pull to within 2:45. ""I knew I had a really good buffer already -- almost four minutes on Contador,"" said Froome. ""And okay, I worked really hard to get that time gap but you can't win them all. ""It was a really tough day. I don't think anyone was expecting it to be this hard. ""On paper it was a flat day and it should have been a bunch sprint but with those crosswinds it definitely made the race a lot more exciting.""","Mark Cavendish wins the 13th stage of the Tour de France for his 25th stage victory .

"(CNN) -- David Villa looks set to swap Catalonia for the Spanish capital after Barcelona announced it had agreed a deal to sell the striker to Atletico Madrid. Villa, who is the Spanish national team's all-time leading goalscorer, could cost the 2013 Spanish Cup winners as much as $6.5 million. ""FC Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of David Villa,"" read a statement from Spanish title holders Barca. ""The deal is set to bring Barca a maximum of â‚¬5.1 million, with â‚¬2.1m due this season, â‚¬2m more if Villa stays at Atletico next year and another million should he be at the Madrid club the season after. ""Barca also reserves the right to 50% of any sell on fee in the future."" Villa joined Barca from Valencia in 2010 and has gone on to score 48 goals in 119 games. The 31-year-old has scored 56 goals in 92 matches for Spain and was part of his country's victorious squads at the European Championships in 2008 and 2012 and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Villa suffered a broken leg at the 2012 Club World Cup and, since recovering from the injury, has struggled to command a regular place in Barca's starting line-up. Villa had been heavily linked with a switch to the English Premier League, with Tottenham Hotspur rumored to be interested in the forward. Meanwhile, French defender Eric Abidal has returned to his first professional club Monaco after his Barcelona contract expired at the end of last season. The 33-year-old left back, who can also play at centre half, has signed a three-year deal in the principality and becomes the latest big-name to head to the newly-promoted club. Abidal has spent much of the last two years battling a liver tumor which led to a liver transplant in March 2012. Monaco, owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, won the French Second Division last season and have prepared for life back in the top tier with a host of high profile signings.

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian police have arrested a man who they say abducted a 5-year-old girl, kept her captive in his house and repeatedly raped her. The girl was initially admitted to a hospital in her neighborhood, where doctors said they removed foreign objects from her genitals, including candle pieces and a small bottle. The assault came barely months after a 23-year physiotherapy student was savagely gang-raped in a moving bus in an attack that triggered seething protests in the country. She later died at a Singapore hospital. In the latest case, a neighbor abducted the girl, locked her in a house and brutally raped her repeatedly before she was found semiconscious three days later, according to police. The suspect was arrested in Bihar state in eastern India and is being brought to New Delhi, city police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. The girl was later transferred to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences hospital in New Delhi. Her condition has stabilized, according to hospital spokesman Y.K. Gupta, who said she underwent surgery to help with her bowel movement. The attack sparked protests in New Delhi on Friday. Many demonstrators are members of a political party of the leading anti-corruption activist, Arvind Kejriwal. Criticized for what was seen as his late response to the December gang rape, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was quick to issue a statement this time, calling the act ""shameful."" And as the nation's media ran footage of a police officer slapping a female protester, Singh also ordered strict action against the officer and anyone who roughed up demonstrators. The girl went missing Sunday evening, her parents say, and police registered their report Monday. She was found Wednesday in a house on the ground floor of her building.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Thousands of Egyptians filled Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday, exactly one year after the start of the revolution that ousted longtime Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak but, many say, accomplished little else. At times the mood in the square was somber and tense amid fears that violence could break out between protesters and the military. Many people held banners as they chanted slogans against the country's military leaders. But some celebrated the anniversary and said Egypt has progressed since Mubarak's ouster. ""This time last year, every person in Egypt was enslaved to Mubarak's regime, and those who dared speak or write about his tyranny paid a high price,"" said Yasmeen Khalil, a teacher. ""Yes, the revolution may not be complete, but I think we have come a long way, and no one can deny it."" Are you there? Share your perspective from Egypt. Egypt's revolution last year came on the heels of Tunisia's revolt that led to the ouster of that country's leader in January 2011. Since then, protests against longtime rulers swept across North Africa and the Middle East, including uprisings in Libya, Yemen and Syria. Signs of progress toward a more democratic system in Egypt after the revolution contrasted with the feeling that the real changes protesters had hoped for have not been realized. Egypt's democratically elected parliament met Monday for the first time since Mubarak was ousted after decades of authoritarian rule. But the country's influential military, which stepped into the vacuum as Mubarak teetered last year, retains much of the decision-making power. Pro-democracy activists, frustrated by what they say is the slow pace of change, have clashed with the military in Cairo's streets in recent months. ""It is ironic that the most times I've ever been beaten, the most times I've ever felt the threat of danger, was after Mubarak stepped down,"" Nour Nour, an activist who was 20 at the time of Mubarak's fall, said in a recent interview. ""And all of these are very basic indications that the regime that is ruling us at the moment is merely a continuation of the Mubarak regime."" Photos: Looking back at Egypt's uprising . In the recent parliamentary elections, established Islamist parties like the Muslim Brotherhood performed much more strongly than the liberal parties that represented some of the protesters. And a new constitution has yet to be drawn up. Some Egyptians have said the hopes forged by protesters in the heady days of January and February last year were doomed to fall short. ""There were too many expectations,"" said Hisham Qasim, a newspaper publisher and human rights activist. ""Raising the expectations was probably the biggest mistake, and media probably have a great part to do with that."" Khalil said she was planning to spend the night in Tahrir Square with her friends, hoping to put pressure on military junta to reaffirm their transfer of power on time, end military tribunals of civilians, increase wages and reimburse families of the of those killed during Egypt's upheaval. But most of all, Khalil said, she wanted a guilty verdict for Mubarak, whom she said robbed the nation for decades and ""watched his people die in the hundreds without ordering his soldiers to stop."" The ailing Mubarak is on trial on charges of corruption and ordering the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the clashes last year that led to his downfall. He has denied the charges. CNN's Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","""I think we have come a long way, and no one can deny it,"" one woman says .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Anton Tanumihardja had his bags packed, anxious about his flight back to his home country, Indonesia.  It was a trip he did not want to make after spending the past eight years in the United States. He feared his absence would mean the end for his relationship with his boyfriend. In a bitter twist, he would be leaving on the night of Valentine's Day. At the last minute came a temporary reprieve: Federal immigration officials issued a stay of deportation just three hours before his flight was to take off. Tanumihardja, who is openly gay, has filed for political asylum, fearing persecution if he is forced to return to Indonesia.  He says his homeland is not tolerant of homosexuals. Although the order gives Tanumihardja more time in Philadelphia, it does not guarantee he can stay forever.  It remains in effect until authorities decide whether to reopen his political asylum application. Tanumihardja, 45, came to the United States in 2002 with a tourist visa from Jakarta, Indonesia.  After his visa expired, he filed for political asylum and received a work permit while his case was being reviewed. When his asylum application and subsequent appeals were denied, immigration authorities told him he had to leave on Monday. ""I got a lot of support from the people who love me and want me to stay,"" Tanumihardja said before breaking down into tears. ""I do not expect anything in return from this country. I just want my status to be legal here."" In addition to his sexual orientation, Tanumihardja is ethnic Chinese and Catholic, making his return to Indonesia more daunting because he would be a triple minority in the predominantly Muslim country. ""Going back to my country means I have to be closed,"" he said, referring to his sexual orientation. ""I cannot come out in my country and have to be hiding who I am."" The root issues of Tanumijardja's case are more complicated than simply deporting someone for an overstayed visa or denying a political asylum application, according to his attorney, Lavi Soloway. The case sits at the intersection of gay rights and immigration reform, he says. ""Our whole immigration system, 80% of the cases are based on family unification, it's about keeping the family together,"" Soloway said. ""But this just doesn't register with the LGBT community. It's a reflection of anti-gay discrimination."" Tanumihardja started dating Brian Andersen last fall, and they have been inseparable ever since. Andersen, 28, is an American citizen. If they were heterosexual and planned to marry, Tanumihardja could possibly have been sponsored for residency, Soloway argues. Under current U.S. law, the sponsorship option does not exist for same-sex couples. Tanumihardja, who has a degree in accounting and marketing, works at Coventry Deli in downtown Philadelphia where he also doubles as the bookkeeper. He will continue his fight to stay, he said. ""I do my best for this county, I love this country,"" he said. Soloway says he fears for Tanumihardja if he is forced to return to Indonesia. ""He is a gay man who has had the opportunity to live openly as a gay man in Philadelphia. And now he's going back to live where in order to survive, you cannot be open,"" Soloway said. ""We guard against taking for granted our freedom to be with those we love."" The last-minute stay of deportation has Tanumihardja and Andersen relieved, but cautious. ""This is the best we could of hoped for at this point,"" Andersen said after hearing the news. ""It's something that is very real and happening.""","Anton Tanumihardja came to the U.S. from Indonesia in 2002 .

"(CNN) -- State Sen. Wendy Davis' stand in Texas was the ""filibuster heard round the world"" -- suddenly everywhere you look, you see news about one state or another rolling back reproductive rights. Even as all eyes were on resumed hearings in Texas late Tuesday night, the North Carolina legislature was busy sneaking anti-choice measures into an unrelated bill, and Wednesday that bill passed the state Senate over the fierce objections of North Carolina women. But the more I read about what is happening to women's rights, the less I see about how anti-choice lawmakers are passing these bills. We're taught as kids that cheaters never win, but that lesson didn't sink in with Republican leaders in Texas and in many other states where these rights are under attack. Instead they've decided that if you don't have the people with you to pass a bill, you can just change the process. Take the Texas bill: a hodgepodge of arbitrary restrictions, it would close nearly 90% of the clinics that perform abortions in Texas, making it impossible for women across the state to access all sorts of medical care they need and deserve. It would also ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which compromises the moral and medical autonomy of women who need care. Following on 12 other states that have enacted the unconstitutional ban, Texas Republicans are trying to put in place costly restrictions to solve a problem that doesn't exist: The number of abortions after 20 weeks is tiny (less than 2%) and are most often sought by women in desperate circumstances, exactly the kind of cases that require close attention by doctors, not sweeping prohibitions by ideological politicians. The Republicans couldn't pass this bill in regular session -- Texas law requires a two-thirds Senate majority for these measures, and the GOP simply didn't have it. So instead of building support the old-fashioned way for this radical legislation, Gov. Perry decided he'd just change the rules. He called a special session after the end of the normal legislative period, and his friend, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, declared they no longer needed a super majority vote. What they didn't count on was opposition from citizens who knew the rules and wouldn't stand by while Republicans cheated. In the House, GOP committee members shut down legally mandated public hearings when witness after witness testified that they resented this intrusion into private, personal medical decisions; then committee members voted on the bill in a private room where the public couldn't see what they were doing. And finally, in the move that earned them national disdain, they tried to use every dirty trick in the book to shut down Davis' historic talking filibuster in the final hours of this widely watched session. They challenged the content of her speech. They cried crocodile tears about her receiving assistance to don a back brace. They ignored Democrats who were raising legitimate procedural questions. Republicans presiding over the debate recognized their fellow Republicans when Democrats had the floor. One senator, Leticia Van de Putte, even had to ask: ""At what point must a female senator raise her voice or hand to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?"" And then, after Texans watching in the gallery erupted in jeers at the strong-handed tactics Republicans were using, the GOP leadership held a vote after midnight, after the special session had officially ended. They then changed the time stamp on the official record of the vote, only changing it back after they were caught red-handed. That meant the bill was dead, so Gov. Rick Perry did what cheaters do when they lose -- he called for a do-over. I wish I could say the tactics in Texas were the exception, but Republicans are using underhanded ploys like these to pass anti-choice bills all over the country. In Ohio, Republicans sneaked a requirement for unnecessary ultrasounds into a budget bill, without holding public hearings. In North Carolina, they shut out testimony from pro-choice activists late in the night to move their draconian measures to the floor for a vote. On Monday, I stood in the hot Austin sun with thousands of fellow Texans who share my outrage at this attack on our fundamental rights. But they didn't just cheer for Davis' stand to protect women's rights and health. They were there to celebrate the rule of democracy, rules that Republicans have shown they will change if it suits their political ends. But changing the rules doesn't change the truth. I don't know what will happen at this next special session in Texas, but I do know that if Republicans cheat their way to victory in this battle, they are going to lose the war for the confidence of the people they seek to represent. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilyse Hogue.","Ilyse Hogue: Texas is trying every trick in the book to get an anti-abortion bill passed .

"(CNN) -- The deadly attack in Kabul on Shi'ite worshippers celebrating the feast of Ashura adds one more layer to the country's overlapping security crises. And they evoke violent sectarian rivalries in Iraq and Pakistan, where animosity between Sunni and Shia runs deep. Afghanistan has its own cultural rifts -- between ethnic Pashtun and Tajik, for example -- but it's rare to see such an explosion of religiously motivated violence. Kate Clark, with the Afghan Analysts Network in Kabul, described the attack as ""a real shock."" ""Whatever else has happened in the past 30 years we haven't had this sort of sectarian attack aimed at killing lots of people,"" she told CNN by phone from the Afghan capital. The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital has come from a militant Sunni group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia. A man identifying himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, a group with links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station in Pakistan sponsored by the United States government. A similar call was reportedly made to the BBC's Urdu-language service. The group is an offshoot of the powerful Lashkar-e-Janghvi (LeJ), which has a record of high-profile suicide bombings in Pakistan, including the attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in 2008. Al-Almi's most destructive attack to date was a double suicide bombing in northwest Pakistan last year. The bombers -- wearing burkas -- killed 42 people belonging to tribes that opposed the Pakistan Taliban, also known for its antipathy toward Shia. If the claim by Al-Almi proves valid, it would not surprise some Afghan Shia, who were quick to point the finger at some form of Pakistani involvement in the attacks Tuesday. LeJ has a long history of targeting the Hazara Shia community in Pakistan. The Hazara are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make up much of Afghanistan's Shia minority. They have endured decades of persecution in both countries, and Sunni militants have frequently painted then as collaborators with occupying powers. This year, apparently in retaliation for the killing of Osama bin Laden, LeJ gunned down several Hazara in Quetta, capital of Balochistan province and also home to the Afghan Taliban's political leadership. In a subsequent open letter, the LeJ warned: ""We will rid Pakistan of [this] unclean people. Pakistan means land of the pure, and the Shias have no right to be here."" In October, Sunni militants killed dozens more Hazara. In one instance, they stopped a bus of Shia pilgrims on their way to Iran from Pakistani Balochistan and shot dead 26 male passengers in front of their families. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has not been obviously active in Afghanistan since it maintained training camps there during Taliban rule in the 1990s. But other Sunni militants -- especially factions among the Pakistani Taliban -- have established a presence in some Afghan border provinces. And regional analysts perceive fluid links, contacts and cross-fertilization between the myriad groups operating in the Afghan-Pakistan border region. The Taliban were quick to disown and condemn the attacks. Kate Clark says that while she is circumspect about the Taliban's denial, such an attack would be at odds with the Taliban leadership's claim to be a national movement -- and is not part of a pattern of such attacks by the group. Clark also points out that Mullah Omar in his Eid message last month urged Taliban fighters to ""protect the lives, wealth and honor of ordinary people."" That being said, 80 percent of all civilian deaths in Afghanistan are attributed to the armed opposition; and orders from the Quetta Shura, as the leadership is known, are only patchily enforced by field commanders. The Taliban are not a monolith, as one Afghan observer puts it, and it is possible that at local level there may have been collaboration between a Taliban operative and LeJ. The Taliban have not played the sectarian card since becoming an insurgency. But when in power in the 1990s they brutally persecuted Afghanistan's Hazara community. Human Rights Watch documented two massacres of Hazara in 2000 and 2001 by Taliban forces. And after capturing Mazar e Sharif in 1998, Taliban fighters killed hundreds of Hazara in retaliation for the mass execution of its own soldiers the previous year. Since the overthrow of the Taliban, Afghanistan's Hazara have prospered -- in higher education, the government and the military and they have embraced new democratic processes. The annual Ashura celebration in Kabul has become more elaborate. That may have been temptation enough for the Hazaras' enemies. If the bombings on Tuesday were an attempt to sow sectarian strife in Afghanistan, they most obviously imitate al Qaeda in Iraq, which when led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi tried to ignite a sectarian war between Sunnis and the country's Shi'ite majority in a series of attacks aimed at holy Shi'ite occasions and shrines. Read the latest on the attacks and the cancellation of Karzai's trip . Kate Clark of the Afghan Analysts Network believes that in Afghanistan restraint will prevail. Hazara leaders have already called on their community to remain calm and not to take the bait offered by these attacks. On all sides, Clark says, there is a realization that sectarian conflict is a no-win situation in which tit-for-tat attacks would claim hundreds of lives.","Shi'ite worshippers were attacked as they celebrated Ashura .

"(CNN) -- Third seed Andy Murray will play world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open after overcoming Roger Federer in a tense five-set semifinal in Melbourne Friday. Sunday will see a repeat of the 2011 final, with Murray looking to avenge his defeat to Djokovic after beating 17-time grand slam winner Federer 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 6-2. Murray will be looking to finally capture the Melbourne title having twice been runner-up at the year's first grand slam. The 25-year-old Briton is also looking for his second straight grand slam title after beating Serbian ace Djokovic in the final of the U.S. Open last September, the first time he had claimed one of the four major titles in tennis. Should he repeat that victory over Djokovic in the Australia final, Murray would become the first player to follow up his maiden grand slam title with another at the first opportunity. World No. 2 Federer was hoping to become the first man in the post-1968 Open era to win the Australian Open on five occasions, but came up short in a high quality match lasting exactly four hours. It was the first time Murray had beaten Federer at a grand slam, but his victory over the Swiss maestro in the gold medal match at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London has acted as a springboard for his later successes. Murray never trailed throughout the match on the Rod Laver Arena, but was twice pegged back as Federer won the second and fourth sets on tiebreaks. Murray served for the match in the fourth set at 6-5, but was denied victory by some brilliant attacking tennis by the second seed as he broke back. Federer carried that momentum into the subsequent tiebreak to force a decider, but Murray showed his mettle by taking control again. An early break saw him forge 5-2 ahead and when Federer served to stay in the match, he was unable to offer more than token resistance, hitting long as Murray sealed an epic and deserved victory. ""I've been known for losing a lot of tough matches and big matches, especially here a few times, and having never beaten Roger in a big match until the Olympics,"" he said in his court side interview. ""That obviously helps but it doesn't make it any easier when you're trying to serve it out."" The 31-year Federer insisted he would bounce back after his third straight semifinal loss in Melbourne and dismissed notions that he would struggle to compete with younger rivals such as Djokovic and Murray. ""I go from here with a good feeling for the year. I didn't play a tournament leading in, so now obviously I know where my level is at,"" he told gathered reporters. ""I also know that I have even more time to work on my game, work on my fitness this year. It's something I'm excited about."" Saturday will see the women's final between World No.1 Victoria Azarenka and former French Open champion Li Na. The championship will close when Murray and Djokovic lock horns 24 hours later, with spectators hoping for a repeat of their epic semifinal clash last year where the latter prevailed in a five set thriller before beating Rafael Nadal in a marathon final. Nadal, the other member of the 'big four', is currently sidelined by a long-term injury but intends to make his comeback next month.","Andy Murray will play Novak Djokovic in Sunday's Australian Open final .

"Washington (CNN) -- Sitting in an office with political memorabilia on the walls, former Washington Mayor Marion Barry reflects on the bad moments -- drug possession, jail, and tax evasion -- and notes that he has moved on. Barry is in many ways after a 40-year public career the prototype for political disgrace and political resurrection. ""I didn't run to be pope, I ran to be mayor,"" said the usually blunt Barry, who rejected any suggestion that his most notable fall from power two decades ago was a scandal. ""Everybody in life has something that they get knocked down on,"" Barry told CNN. ""The object lesson here is not that you get knocked down, it is that you get up."" A recent poll showed that the veteran of the Civil Rights movement who was first elected to public office in the 1970s and currently holds down a City Council seat, is now the most popular local politician in the District of Columbia. Rebounding from setbacks that might have crushed others professionally, the Ward 8 representative has become an expert in political recovery. Scandals erode trust and polls show the public is wary following a string of high profile embarrassments. Last year alone in Washington, House members Chris Lee, David Wu and Anthony Weiner all left office amid scandal. Closer to home, Washington's City Council Chairman Kwame Brown became the second embattled member of the panel to resign this year. Washington Mayor Vincent Gray's victorious 2010 campaign also is under an investigative cloud. What would Marion do? While it may be surprising, a politician looking to bounce back might ask: What would Marion do? When asked what recommendation he would offer politicians in trouble, Barry allowed a chuckle. Reflecting on his experiences, Barry highlights courage, resilience and appreciation. ""When there is adversity around you, whatever kind it is, you cannot let it interfere with your work, you cannot let it give up your trust of the people and you can't let yourself look like you are just down and out,"" Barry, 76, said. Barry added that scandal can make a politician resilient and better suited for the rough and tumble of public life. ""I think people in general in this country are distrustful of politicians, even at the presidential level,"" Barry said. But to most Washington political experts, Barry has added to that distrust. Mark Plotkin, a veteran political analyst, said some still look at Barry's professional longevity as an example of what is wrong with American politics more than 20 years after Barry, while serving as mayor, went to jail for drug possession. ""He is the model of what is perceived as corruption and bad behavior,"" Plotkin said. ""Barry is the personification of everything that is bad government, a persona that overwhelms the political system."" Plotkin has known Barry for decades and said his best asset is his ability to calculate who votes and how to play to that group. ""His greatest strength is his audacity, his shameless confidence in himself,"" Plotkin said. ""He once told me, 'My whole life, people told me what I can't do. And I never accepted that.' I think that is an accurate exception of how he feels. That is his strength."" D.C. credibility issues . Gray recently became the third mayor out of the last four to serve the capital to be stung by ethics questions. It surfaced this year that Gray knew in January that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign, according to a source close to a federal investigation of his campaign funding. Earlier this year, a public relations consultant pleaded guilty to helping orchestrate a secret campaign on Gray's behalf, prompting three of Gray's former colleagues on the Washington council to call for his resignation. ""The city government has a real serious credibility problem, a real serious trust problem, a real serious big picture problem and people are just disgusted to some extent,"" said Barry, who has been friends with Gray for 35 years. ""The good news is that they have not blamed individual politicians like myself for all of that."" And that may Barry's best -- although unspoken - advice for bouncing back from scandal. When asked about transgressions, Barry generally deflects, denies and then credits himself for moving on. To this day -- after the 1990 drug conviction, a six-month jail sentence, and a 2005 guilty plea to misdemeanor tax charges -- Barry denies that he ever had a political scandal. According to Barry, the only thing he did wrong was avoid paying income taxes. ""Million of Americans don't file their taxes,"" Barry said. ""I am not saying it is right, but that happened and that is behind me, too."" CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Former D.C. Mayor Marion Barry went to jail for drug possession in 1990s .

"(CNN) -- Hugo Chavez's 14 years as president of Venezuela were so personality-driven that the movement behind him became known as ""Chavismo."" Chavismo encompasses not just the political machine that saw Chavez re-elected four times, but a leftist ideology that prioritized the redistribution of oil wealth to the marginalized and valued sovereignty as something to be protected from ""imperialist"" powers. Now, with its leader gone, the future of Chavismo could take many paths, experts say. Other powerful leaders in history who left a similar hole have seen their ideologies live on, though not without change. There is a trade-off between the degree to which a government centers on one person and the strength of that country's institutions, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College who studies Venezuela. In general, the stronger the central figure, the weaker the institutions. ""In authoritarian regimes, you always have a crisis moment when you see a change in leadership,"" Corrales said. Chavez was democratically elected, but his efforts to consolidate power in the presidency led to accusations of authoritarianism. Change is inevitable after the loss of a revered leader, but the degree of transformation varies. In Yugoslavia in the period after World War II until 1980, Josip Broz Tito succeeded in keeping the various ethnic groups in his country united. Despite being considered an authoritarian, he remained popular because of the unity and economic success. Upon his death, however, the country unraveled and fell into civil war, and Yugoslavia crumbled, eventually splitting into separate nations. After Joseph Stalin died in the Soviet Union, there was a complete break with his regime under the new leader, Nikita Khrushchev. Khrushchev rejected Stalin's terror tactics. Change in Cuba was more subtle after the passing of the torch from Fidel Castro to his brother Raul Castro, Corrales said. The Castros share their communist views, but after the younger Castro took office, he purged some men and has since pursued policies to somewhat open up Cuba. Venezuelan interim President Nicolas Maduro is expected to vie for the full-time job, and analysts predict he has the best shot at getting elected. If elected, Maduro eventually will have to purge some of the Chavez loyalists and shake up the Cabinet to consolidate his own power, Corrales said. ""Whoever comes next is going to have to assert himself in a pretty domineering way,"" he said. U.S.-Venezuela relations likely to remain tense after Chavez . The lasting power of Chavez's image . Chavez's dedication to putting the nation's poor at the forefront of his policies made him a hero among a large sector of the population. His freewheeling spending of his nation's oil wealth was criticized by some economists as unsustainable, but Venezuela's poor saw results and elevated Chavez to hero status. In Latin America, such status carries a lot of weight. Hero or villain? The many ways to see Chavez . Consider a movement in Nicaragua that has survived over the years: Sandinismo. Augusto Sandino was the leader of a rebellion in the late 1920s and early 1930s against an American occupation. The Sandinistas are in power today in Nicaragua, under President Daniel Ortega, though the movement has little to do with its origins, said Andres Perez, a professor of political science at the University of Western Ontario. Sandino's memory has been manipulated for political purposes over time, just like Chavez's might. Years after Sandino was killed, Nicaraguans used his image as a symbol in their own rebellion to overthrow a dictatorship. A movement, the Sandinista National Liberation Front, was born. The current Sandinista president uses the same symbol and movement, though it has been manipulated from earlier Sandinismo, Perez said. ""When people find a symbol or answer to their aspirations, they tend to perpetuate it,"" Perez said. In the case of Chavismo, it is difficult to predict what will happen the movement as a political movement, Perez said. ""But what I can say is that the memory of Chavez will last. It will be very difficult to erase it from the poor sector of Venezuela who found answers in the image and words of Chavez,"" he said. Millions of Venezuelans found hope in Chavez, and now the question is who will appropriate his image and how will they use it, Perez said. Conceivably, even the opposition could take aspects of Chavez's legacy and make it their own, he said. Already during last year's electoral campaign, the opposition vowed not to undo the social missions that Chavez initiated, but only to modify them. The director of the polling firm Datanalisis, Luis Vicente Leon, predicted something similar in a series of Twitter posts before Chavez died. ""To count out Chavismo without Chavez is to ignore that there is Peronism without Peron and Sandinismo without Sandino,"" he tweeted. ""It will suffer a great loss without Chavez, but it has a legacy of power and symbolism that it can exploit."" Peronism is a movement named after former Argentine President Juan Peron, a legacy that has been claimed over the years by parties both on the political right and left. Outlook good for Chavismo in short term . Despite suffering from cancer, Chavez resoundingly won re-election in October. His popularity, combined with the outpouring of tributes in the wake of his death, make a Chavista victory likely in the new elections that must be called. Maduro was named by Chavez as his preferred successor and could easily win the election, but he will have to put the movement's unity as his priority, said Steve Ellner, a professor at Venezuela's Universidad de Oriente who has written several books about Chavez's Venezuela. There are divisions within Chavismo that have come to light as Chavez's health faded. Some stand behind Maduro, who is close with the Cuban regime, while others side with Diosdado Cabello, the National Assembly president who is more of a nationalist. Because Chavez was never sworn in for his latest terms, there is even a debate over which of the two, constitutionally, should be the interim president. In the short term, Maduro will have to avoid internal dissent that threatens the movement, Ellner said. That may mean adopting populist positions that the nationalists like. ""I don't see a turn to the moderate policies that some favor,"" Ellner said. One of the characteristics of Chavismo is the fervor of its adherents. Chavez was a master of cultivating that fervor, and the next Chavista leader will have to do the same, Ellner said. ""In any process of far-reaching changing, it is essential,"" he said. Maintaining that level of fervor keeps followers from becoming disillusioned, he said. One of Chavez's strategies was to surprise Venezuelans with new policies that invigorated the rank-and-file, a formula that future leaders may have to follow, he said. In a speech at his swearing in as interim leader, Maduro promised to follow Chavez's path. ""We still have him in our hearts,"" he said. ""I have him here, here, as if he was the name in my soul, because I am his son."" The future of Chavismo . The grip of Chavismo on Venezuela is not guaranteed. ""I have my doubts about the existence of Chavismo without Chavez,"" leading opposition figure Henrique Capriles told a Spanish newspaper in January. ""To me, any movement without its leading figure is deeply vulnerable."" Capriles is expected to be the opposition candidate to challenge Maduro for the presidency. ""It will depend on opposition voters understanding that Chavismo without Chavez is beatable and deeply vulnerable if they mobilize,"" he said. If Chavismo is victorious in its first election without Chavez, the new leader will have to face decisions that may cause dissatisfaction among the movement, said Corrales, the Amherst professor. If Maduro wins, he will have to deal with a tough economic crisis and will be forced to consider future devaluations and spending cuts, topics which have provoked tensions within Chavismo in the past. The next president also will have to rethink the way that the country's oil wealth is spent and the subsidies it provides, both foundations of Chavismo. Supporters of Chavez are more optimistic about the lasting legacy of Chavez. ""Chavismo, at one point, was focused on the figure of Chavez as the all-emcompassing one, but it grew and expanded to become this mass movement that has crossed the borders out of Venezuela into the world beyond and has affected countries around the world,"" Eva Golinger, a Venezuelan-American attorney, author and adviser to Chavez told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Chavismo and the social revolution that Chavez began will continue, she predicted. ""Chavez (was) a very powerful personality, very charismatic person, larger than life, and most media attention went to him,"" Golinger said. ""But in the end, what really has been going on in Venezuela is a whole transformation of the country, that's why it's called a revolution, changing every sector of society.""","Chavismo is the political movement that backed Hugo Chavez .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The international community is now waiting for confirmation from the United States and South Korea on whether a seismic disturbance in North Korea Tuesday is in fact the hermit regime's third underground nuclear test. The area of the disturbance is near the area of North Korea's two previous nuclear tests. The epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 event has little to no history of earthquakes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If confirmed as a North Korean nuclear explosion, the event would closely follow a controversial rocket launch from December which marked a milestone in the pariah state's rocket program. The United States and many other countries believe it is a cover for the testing of ballistic missile technology. Late 1970s . With Chinese technical assistance, North Korea begins working on the development of short-range ballistic missiles based on Soviet Scud technology, which is itself derived from Germany's V-2 rocket. 1980-84 . Work starts on the development of the North's own version of the Scud-B missile system, thought to be designated the Hwasong-5. Successfully test launches several prototypes with a range of around 300km. 1985-87 . Deployment of Hwasong-5 begins, followed by the longer range Hwasong-6 (500km), which gives Pyongyang the ability to hit targets deep into South Korea. 1987-95 . Begins development of No-dong missiles, a ""scaled up"" version of the Scud with a range of 1,000-1,300km and much larger payload, allowing it to reach Japan and Taiwan. A No-dong is successfully tested from the Musudan-ri launch site, traveling 500km before plunging into the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Though the project is beset by technical problems -- the missile's targeting system was inaccurate -- the No-dong arouses particular concern because it could potentially carry a nuclear warhead. North Korea has long been suspected of developing its own nuclear weapons program. Late 1990s . Pyongyang introduces the Taepo-dong-1 and 2 -- both multi-stage missiles that give them a much longer range. A Taepo-dong-1 is test-fired in August 1998 -- reportedly overflying northern Japan -- in an apparent attempt to deploy a satellite in space. Though the mission fails, the first two stages of the three-stage rocket separate successfully and travel for almost 1,700km. May 1999 . Former Defense Secretary William Perry visits North Korea and delivers a U.S. disarmament proposal. September 1999 . North Korea pledges to freeze long-range missile tests. U.S. President Bill Clinton eases economic sanctions against North Korea just days later. A U.S.-led international consortium also agrees to sign a $4.6 billion contract to build two nuclear reactors in North Korea. June 2001 . Unhappy with the progress on its promised power plants, North Korea threatens to restart its nuclear weapons program. It says it will start testing missiles again unless normalized relations are resumed with the U.S. July 2001 . U.S. State Department reports North Korea is going ahead with development of its long-range missile. A Bush administration official says North Korea has conducted an engine test of the Taepo-dong-1 missile. December 2001 . President George W. Bush warns Iraq and North Korea that they would be ""held accountable"" if they developed weapons of mass destruction ""that will be used to terrorize nations."" January 2002 . Bush labels North Korea, Iran and Iraq an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union address. ""By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger,"" he says. 2003 . North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an agreement that was signed by most of the world's countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It reactivates its nuclear power facilities and begins test-firing missiles. In April that year, Pyongyang declares that it is a nuclear power. July 2006 . North Korea test-fires six missiles, including a long-range Taepo-dong-2 rocket believed capable of reaching western United States. The rocket fails after 40 seconds, but U.S. denounces tests as ""provocative."" October 2006 . North Korea claims to have successfully tested a nuclear weapon at an underground facility in Hwaderi. Days later, the test would be confirmed by the outside world. Responding to the test, the U.N. Security Council approves a resolution to impose sanctions against North Korea and require an end to nuclear and ballistic missile tests. North Korea rejects the resolution and walks out of the Security Council chamber. February 2007 . North Korea agrees to take first steps toward nuclear disarmament and shut down its main reactor within 60 days before eventually dismantling its atomic weapons program after six-party talks in Beijing. September 2007 . In an agreement signed at the six-party talks in Beijing, North Korea agrees to begin disabling its nuclear weapons facilities and allow a U.S. team, including technical experts, to take the lead in doing so. August 2008 . North Korea declares it has stopped disabling its nuclear plants and will consider restoring them since the U.S. has not removed it from a list of states that sponsor terrorism. October 2008 . U.S. removes North Korea from list of states that sponsor terrorism. April 2009 . North Korea initiates what it calls a peaceful launch of a satellite, but the U.S. State Department declares it a ""provocative act in violation"" of a 2006 Security Council resolution prohibiting North Korea from conducting ballistic missile launches. North Korea says any sanctions or pressure applied against it following its recent rocket launch would be considered a ""declaration of war."" May 2009 . A second underground nuclear test is conducted in May that year. March 2012 . North Korea declares it will launch a long-range rocket in April to deploy a satellite into orbit. April 2012 . Defying warnings from the international community, North Korea launches a long-range rocket. However it breaks apart before escaping the earth's atmosphere and falls into the sea. In an unusual admission of failure, North Korean state media announces that the rocket had not managed to put the observation satellite into orbit. December 2012 . Pyongyang announces plans to launch another rocket in a fresh attempt to send a satellite into orbit. Just two days after announcing that the launch window would be extended due to technical issues, a long-range rocket lifts off from a launch site on the west coast of North Korea. Amid a chorus of international criticism, Pyongyang declares the mission a success and says a satellite was sent into orbit. January 2013 . A U.N. Security Council resolution submitted by the United States condemns December's rocket launch and expands existing sanctions. In response, North Korea issues a statement saying that it plans to carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it said are a part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. February 2013 . North Korea appeared to have conducted its third underground nuclear bomb test February 12, as the U.S. Geological Survey reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous nuclear tests. The area around the reported epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 disturbance has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards, according to U.S. Geological Survey maps. ""It's a nuclear test,"" said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.

"(CNN) -- Running an airline creates an astonishing amount of waste. Food, fuel, and the millions of tons of waste from worn carpets, uniforms and seat cushions adds up. Fortunately, many have started to get creative with recycling, turning their used goods into bags, quilts, shoes, carpets, and in one instance, a wedding dress. What passengers don't see when they board a plane is that many components have a shelf life. Life vests, for instance, are only good for six years before they need replacing. Even the seats have an expiration date. ""After so many dry cleanings, seat covers lose their fire retardant coating, so by FAA rules, they can't remain on the plane,"" explains Matt Mahler, founder of Tierra Ideas, an design label that's teamed with Delta Airlines to create bags and wallets from the carrier's old seat covers and curtains. Since partnering with Mahler in 2010, the airline has recycled 7,973 pounds of textiles. Gallery: How dead airplanes get a second life . Nothing generates as much potential rubbish as a merger or logo change however. In those instances, any material bearing the old emblem or company colors needs to be scrapped to make way for the new. When KLM changed their uniforms 18 months ago, they had tons of useless fabric on their hands. They decided to give it to Desso Aviation, a carpet company with a zero-waste, 100% biodegradable approach known as ""cradle-to-cradle"". Desso wove the uniforms into carpets, which were kitted out on the new World Business Class cabin on KLM's Boeing 747-400 fleet, this July. Usually, Desso likes to know the background of products, because it affects how the materials will be used going forward. Nylon carpets, for instance, can be recycled, and turned into new carpets. When a wool carpet surpasses its utility, it gets turned into secondary fuel for the cement industry, and the leftover chalk gets used for backing carpet tiles. Delta disposes its carpets in a similar way, saving 340 tons of materials from the dumpster. Finnair has a more do-gooder approach. Old uniforms get sent to clean up oil spills, blankets are shipped to refugee camps in Myanmar and airline seats get fashioned into passenger seats in Finnish Red Cross emergency vehicles. Finnair also donates clothing and furniture to workshops for special needs individuals. ""We don't need to make a new business opportunity for ourselves; we're not in the recycling business and don't want to go into it,"" says Kati IhamÃ¤ki, Finnair's vice president for sustainable development. ""Instead, we'd rather help others find and create new opportunities from our old products,"" Finnair also collaborates with design label Global Hope, which also creates bags from their old uniforms. The carrier also sponsors competitions with local clothing and furniture designers, pushing them to create goods from their discards. Recently, the winner in a Finnish wedding design competition used KLM uniforms to create her couture gown. Report: Airline recycling in 'sorry state' However, Air France-KLM currently lead the pack in terms of their environmental efforts (the company has topped the Dow Jones Sustainability Index four years running). Sophie Virapin, Air France's vice president of sustainable development, estimates 80% of their on-board material is recycled and reused. In December, the airline teamed with upcycling design label Bilum to create bags from old billboard posters and life jackets. The life jacket cases, which retailed for $31, have already sold out. ""Of our projects, the bags were fun and sexy for customers and the media, but they were just one little action,"" says Virapin, who is eager to point out the many less enticing ways Air France has cut back on waste. Plastic meal trays are repurposed to create plastic cutlery, the cables from seat backs are refashioned into headphones and retired aircraft are combed for reusable parts, which either get reborn in newer planes or passed on to General Electric. ""When we launch a new product, we always ask, 'what is the life cycle of this product and what will we do with it at the end of its life?'"" says Virapin.","Delta, Finnair and Air France have teamed with designers to craft bags from worn gear and uniforms .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When North Korea conducts an underground nuclear test, a vast array of global sensors will detect the detonation almost immediately. But key questions about the size of the explosion, the number of bombs tested, or whether plutonium or uranium was used, may never be answered conclusively, analysts say. North Korea appears to have conducted an underground nuclear bomb test Tuesday, as the U.S. Geological Survey reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous nuclear tests. The area around the reported epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 disturbance has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards, according to U.S. Geological Survey maps. Despite international condemnation, North Korea has said it would conduct its third underground nuclear test. A third nuclear test could enable North Korea the technical data needed to miniaturize a warhead, according to a recent paper in the ""Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists."" Coming on the heels of December's successful launch of a satellite, the threat of an atomic test has raised concerns. Pyongyang's efforts seemed hapless when a rocket launch failed earlier in 2012. But its spotty record changed in early December when North Korea launched the long-range Unha-3 rocket carrying a satellite, showing the world it had the technology to launch a long-range missile -- with analysts suggesting parts of the United States, Pyongyang's stated arch rival, were now within range. Following the U.N. condemnation of the launch in January, Pyongyang says it plans a new nuclear test and further long-range rocket launches. ""An additional nuclear test or two would greatly increase the likelihood that Pyongyang could fashion warheads to fit at least some of its missiles -- a circumstance that would vastly increase the threat its nuclear program poses to the security of Northeast Asia,"" wrote analyst Frank Pabian and Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor who visited North Korean nuclear sites in 2010. How does an underground test work? Satellite photos showed the preparation of a third tunnel in Punggye-ri area, located 232 kilometers northeast of Pyongyang near the Sea of Japan, where the two previous tests were located. Work appeared to begin in 2009 and now is largely completed. Analysts estimate the new tunnel is one kilometer long and 380 meters deep. Tests are typically conducted in vertical shafts, according to the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBTO). Holes are cut 1 to 3 meters wide and up to a kilometer deep. The atomic devices are assembled on site and placed in the hole, usually accompanied by lead-protected diagnostic canister that contains sensors to record the explosion. The tunnel is then filled with layers of pea gravel, sand and other materials to prevent radioactive material from being released into the atmosphere. During a test, the explosion energy is released in less than a millionth of a second, according to CTBTO. The temperature will reach about a million degrees within a few microseconds, and shockwaves from the blast, depending on the size, can be detected by seismographs around the planet. Is underground testing dangerous? Of the more than 2,000 nuclear detonations since 1945, 75% of the explosions have been tests conducted underground, largely by the major nuclear powers of the United States, the former Soviet Union (now Russia), Britain, France and China, according to the CTBTO. Underground testing is much safer than above-ground testing. ""With underground testing, you can contain the radiation,"" said Annika Thunborg, CTBTO spokesperson. Still, nuclear particles can be accidentally released into the atmosphere. North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006 leaked radiation into the air which was picked up at a CTBTO monitoring station in Yellowknife, Canada -- more than 4,500 miles away. There is always a danger of radiation seeping, hence the total test ban treaty, Thunborg said. ""The U.S. tried to control radiation release with its underground tests, but in 150 cases radiation was released into the atmosphere,"" Thunborg said. But if Pyongyang plans to explode an even larger device, risks elevate as well. ""One of the risks Pyongyang takes in trying to demonstrate a test at a higher level is that they may produce fissures that allow radioactive seepage or possibly cause a major blowout from the tunnel,"" Hecker wrote in Foreign Policy on February 4. ""The U.S. testing program experienced such problems even after having conducted hundreds of tests. Unrecognized complex geological conditions apparently led to a blowout during the 1970 underground Baneberry nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site. The blowout released a radioactive cloud nearly 10,000 feet high."" Such a blowout would also release a lot more data on the test to outside observers, but ""spewing a radioactive cloud over the skies of Northeast Asia would create an enormous political storm from the nearby countries,"" Hecker wrote. Why is underground testing controversial? North Korea is the only country to have carried out atomic explosions on the planet since 1998, when Pyongyang conducted underground nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Before that, both India and Pakistan conducted underground tests in 1998, according to CTBTO. The 1996 treaty, which has been signed by 183 nations, aims to ban all nuclear testing on the planet, whether in the atmosphere or underground. While the comprehensive test ban treaty hasn't formally become law (it awaits ratification by China, Egypt, India, Iran Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and the U.S.), only North Korea, India and Pakistan have broken the moratorium on nuclear testing, according to the CTBTO. Testing in the atmosphere and underwater was banned by the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty, after public concerns over radioactive fallout from tests. The U.S., the Soviet Union and Britain signed the treaty, but nuclear powers France and China did not. France conducted its last above ground nuclear test in 1974; China in 1980. To develop the technology for its atomic weapons program, North Korea needs to conduct tests to perfect the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon so that it can be mounted on a missile, delivered without mishap and hit its intended target. How will we know if North Korea carries out an underground test? Once a nuclear device is exploded, seismographs around the world will detect the movement. ""Manmade explosions have a very different signature than natural events,"" Thunborg said. ""Seismic technology is the core function of any monitoring system, and we are running the only international system that is dedicated to ensure that no nuclear explosion will go undetected in compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty."" The CTBTO operates a global system of more than 300 monitors -- such as seismic, sonar or radiation sensors -- in 85 countries across the world. Even if no radiation escapes into the atmosphere, underground explosions leak noble gases into the atmosphere which CTBTO sensors can detect, Thunborg said.","A vast array of global sensors will detect any North Korea nuclear detonation almost immediately .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Scroll through Kickstarter, and you'll get a kick out the sheer variety of projects with tin cups in hand. A documentary about the Dungeons and Dragons fantasy role-playing game, a zombie board game, even a sprouting pencil -- all are looking for handouts via the popular crowd-funded site. But one project in particular caught our attention in the CNN newsroom. Called ""Float,"" it gives Beijing residents the tools to measure air quality for themselves with pollution-sensing kites. Kites have been flown for recreation, sport and art. But for environmental monitoring? It is the tethered aircraft that got the best of Charlie Brown, and it's now tracking air quality that's among the worst in the world. ""There's a long tradition of kite flying and kite making in China,"" says Xiaowei Wang, a masters candidate at the Harvard School of Graduate Design and one of the co-creators of Float. ""There's a large group of enthusiasts, and we really wanted to tap into this existing group of people excited about kites."" Float raised over US$4,500 on Kickstarter to hold workshops for Beijing residents to learn how to build and fly pollution-sensing kites. Among those taking part, 40-to-70-year-old Chinese workers and retirees who enjoy flying kites -- including a 72-year-old kitemaster. Blog: Clearing the air in China . The kites are equipped with small modules that detect carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and particulate matter. Air quality levels are displayed through LED lights that change in color -- from hot pink (which represents the worst air quality) to green (which signifies the best). All data from the flight is stored on an SD card. Xiaowei and her team have held two workshops and a group kite flight in the evening to create a sparkling web of glowing crafts. Float is keen to highlight the visual and sensory experience of their project with Xiaowei telling me, ""From the ground looking up, it's like a kite flash mob because the sky is full of all these kites."" But a constellation of pollution-sensors in the sky is more than public art or a reboot of a popular pastime. In China, it can be a political challenge. In June, a senior Chinese official demanded that foreign embassies stop issuing air pollution readings. Citing the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, Deputy Environment Minister Wu Xiaoqing said foreign embassy pollution readings were illegal. U.S. readings challenge China's smog claims . Though Wu did not name any countries in particular, it was seen as throw-down directed at America's diplomatic missions which post hourly air quality readings via Twitter for Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The U.S. readings, which frequently rate Beijing's air as ""unhealthy,"" are widely viewed as reliable alternatives to China's own monitoring reports. China may say only it has the right to monitor its air pollution. But Float has untethered China's official grip on air quality data with its high-flying sensors. And they know it. On its Kickstarter page, Float acknowledges the politically sensitive nature of its project. The team writes: ""Urban air quality is a serious issue that affects rapidly industrializing cities globally, and within Beijing as the capital of China, it is an issue kept quiet by the government under fear of criticism and protest from the public."" Xiaowei insists their project is not seen as threatening, and looks forward to future workshops in Beijing next summer. And with a smile, Xiaowei tells me: ""It's hard to imagine the government getting upset with a group of retired guys who enjoy flying kites.""","Float gives Beijing residents the tools to measure air quality for themselves with pollution-sensing kites .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China is planning to ban shark fin soup from being served at official banquets, in a sign the country may be losing its taste for the expensive delicacy. According to Chinese media, the Government Office Administration of the State Council said the ban could take up to three years to implement and would help cut the cost of sometimes lavish banquets held for state functions. The move followed a proposal made during the National People's Congress in March this year. Bertha Lo of the campaign group Hong Kong Shark Foundation said the move could potentially reduce the amount of sharks killed given that China is the biggest consumer of shark fin products. ""I think it will have an impact,"" she said. ""The government in China is powerful and if it takes the lead on this issue, I don't see why others shouldn't follow suit."" Between 26 million and 73 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year, according to a 2006 academic study quoted on the website of Lo's group. Their carcasses are usually discarded and campaigners say the practice is wasteful and cruel. The World Wildlife Fund says that 181 species of shark are under threat, up from 15 in 1996. Shark's fin soup is widely served in restaurants in Chinese communities worldwide and is a dish often served at weddings to mark the importance of the occasion and impress the couple's extended families and friends. But the custom has become less popular among a younger generation of diners, who are more environmentally conscious, says Lo. Last year, the operator of the high-end Peninsula hotel chain said it would remove shark fin products from its menus and Shangri-la Hotels made a similar move this year. Shark fins off the menu at top hotel . In Beijing, the five-star Swissotel has also stopped serving shark fin, according to the China Daily. Outside Asia, legislation banning shark fin has been introduced in five U.S. states including California, which this month also banned the French duck liver delicacy foie gras on the grounds of cruelty. In China, the campaign against shark fin products has gained steam following pledges by celebrities, such as former NBA star Yao Ming, not to eat the delicacy.","China plans ban on shark fin being served at official banquets .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Now that Facebook is friends with Wall Street, this journalist is giving her timeline a rethink. I rejoiced when it launched Facebook Pages, as this was a chance to build a professional presence on the network separate from my personal feed.

I turn to Twitter for real-time information, especially during breaking news. I turn to Google+ for thoughtful conversation around stories I share. Infographic: How we use Facebook .

But my Facebook page remains a fan zone, and I've come to the conclusion that Facebook is a social tool for engagement and not journalism. Facebook is all about consumer engagement -- the engagement of nearly a billion consumers. That's why advertisers can't ignore it. And here's where it cuts to the heart of my profession. Journalists have been flocking to Facebook to create content and connections on a platform that the company can use for all time. Not only that, we're feeding an advertising rival that's only going to get bigger after Friday's IPO. I'm not quite convinced that Facebook is a must-buy for journalism.

"(CNN) -- Last year on December 1 -- World AIDS Day -- President Barack Obama said that creating an ""AIDS-free generation"" around the world was finally within our grasp. This World AIDS Day, let's help him achieve that goal. And let's start in the United States. While the AIDS research and activist communities continue to celebrate some major breakthroughs during the past few years, we continue to struggle with an epidemic in the United States that grows unabated. Each year, 50,000 Americans become newly infected with HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS -- and more than 1.1 million people are living with the virus. And while everyone is at risk and should know their status, data tell us that communities of color -- particularly black women and young, black gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men -- are disproportionately affected by the virus. If we're going to create an AIDS-free generation here at home, we need to start investing in resources that will curb the epidemic among these populations. Hillary Clinton unveils 'blueprint' to combat AIDS . According to a Fenway Institute study released at this year's International AIDS Conference, nearly 6% of black men under the age of 30 who have sex with men are newly infected with HIV every year in six cities across the United States. That's three times the rate among white men who have sex with men. Perhaps most alarming, a Black AIDS Institute study claims that 60% of black men who have sex with men will have HIV by age 40. Among black women, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that nearly 1 in 32 black women will become infected with HIV in their lifetime. And despite representing 14% of the female U.S. population, black women make up 66% of all new HIV infections among women, according to the HIV Prevention Trials Network. When statistics are this shocking, we must take action. In his World AIDS Day address last year, Obama said, ""When new infections among young, black, gay men increase by nearly 50% in three years, we need to do more to show them that their lives matter. When Latinos are dying sooner than other groups; when black women feel forgotten even though they account for most of the new cases among women, we need to do more."" So: What can we do to make people feel like they matter, and feel like we haven't forgotten them? One thing we can all do right now is go get tested -- and encourage our friends and neighbors to get tested, too. Knowing your status is the first step to curbing the epidemic. Go to hivtest.cdc.gov to find out where to get tested in your neighborhood. If you test negative, learn how to stay that way. If you test positive, learn your treatment options and take control of your health. Second, we must fight the disease -- not the people who have it. We need an open dialogue among families, schools, and churches about the risks of HIV, and we need to recognize the role stigma plays in pushing the epidemic underground and unchecked. Stigma against people living with this disease, or who are particularly vulnerable to it, has no place in our evidence-based quest to stop the spread of AIDS. We must hate this disease; we must never hate our fellow human beings. Third, we must educate everyone -- particularly black women and young black men -- about their vulnerability to the virus. Everyone has a right to feel empowered to take control of their sexual lives and the health of themselves and their families. Half of young people with HIV don't know it . Finally, we need to realize that AIDS will remain with us as long as we keep our guard down. The dialogue we start this week needs to take place every day, not just World AIDS Day. Talk to your kids about the importance of safe sex and abstinence. Talk to your partners about the importance of monogamy. Thirty years into the AIDS epidemic, we can finally see, in the distance, an end. We finally possess the ability to change this region's, and the world's, future. Will you join us in helping us create a truly AIDS-free generation by first creating one here at home? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Janet Jackson and Mathilde Krim.","We continue to struggle with an unabated HIV epidemic in the United States .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's latest nuclear test, coming on the heels of December's successful satellite launch, suggests that Pyongyang is moving forward toward developing a nuclear warhead and a deliverable missile system, experts say. The question remains: How close is it? The answer, like the cloistered ""hermit kingdom,"" remains largely a mystery, as does much of its nuclear program. ""It's a question over the delivery system and the reliability of those systems,"" said Daniel Pinkston, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group covering Northeast Asia. ""That is essentially unknown, or known by a few people inside North Korea."" South Korean rocket successfully puts satellite in orbit . A 2009 report by International Crisis Group suggests that North Korea ""probably has somewhere between six and twelve nuclear weapons, or at least explosive devices,"" but notes that experts are divided on whether any of these are now usable as warheads -- small enough to be mounted on missiles and durable enough to withstand the hazards of flight. ""It's pretty clear that these are advanced technologies and the systems present a number of engineering challenges -- and to master these technologies requires a number of tests,"" Pinkston said. North Korea on Google Maps: Monuments, nuclear complex, gulags . In December, on the first anniversary of the death of its former leader Kim Jong Il, North Korea successfully launched a three-stage rocket that put the satellite Shining Star-3 into orbit. The launch also signaled that the North's long-range missile program now puts the United States within reach. Last month, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that strengthened sanctions against the North in response to the December rocket launch. Declaring sanctions to be tantamount to ""a declaration of war,"" North Korea threatened further missile and nuclear tests, which it said are a new phase of confrontation with the United States. For the U.N. and North Korea: Game on . Tuesday's underground nuclear test is North Korea's third, following tests in 2009 and 2006. The test, ""probably"" conducted in the vicinity of P'unggye, yielded ""several kilotons,"" according to assessments cited by the U.S. director of national intelligence. Koreas in 2013: Watch the generational politics . Estimates of the size, or yield, of the 2009 nuclear test range from 2.5 kilotons to 6 kilotons, Pinkston said. By comparison, the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima had a yield of 16 kilotons. While the specter of a North Korea able to send nuclear-tipped missiles is worrisome, equally troublesome to the international community is Pyongyang's atomic technology fueling the black market for weapons. ""If its clandestine uranium-enrichment program has made strides, Pyongyang could demonstrate that it will gain access to a far larger pool of fissile material than simply its limited supply of weapons-grade plutonium,"" wrote Patrick M. Cronin, an Asia expert at the Center for New American Security, in a CNN op-ed. ""A larger pool of fissile material is a dual threat: As a vital part of an expanded nuclear weapon program and as a commodity to be sold on the black market.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In CNN's Hong Kong newsroom, right next to my desk, there's a ""douche jar."" Inspired by the TV series ""New Girl,"" the ""douche jar"" was placed in our cubicle cluster to prevent general douchebaggery or acts of egregious self-promotion. It works like this -- if you say or do something like a douchebag, you put a fistful of local currency into the jar. In case you're not familiar with the term, the Urban Dictionary offers up this definition. The douchebag ""has an inflated sense of self-worth, compounded by a lack of social grace and self-awareness. He behaves inappropriately in public, yet is completely ignorant to how pathetic he appears to others."" In the newsroom, the jar is usually low on cash. Most of its contributions are made in jest by a colleague out to channel a self-absorbed jerk. But on Twitter, the ""douche jar"" is always full. There are tweets that claim to be BREAKING NEWS, when they are not. There are tweets that overuse #hashtags. And tweets that are whiny and excessively personal. The general douchebaggery across Twitter is so profound it's prompted one user to launch ""Klouchebag"" -- a Klout-like site that generates your douche score. For the uninitiated, Klout uses analytics to determine a user's influence across social networks. Is Twitter slowing down? On Klouchebag, The ever-#winning Charlie Sheen registers as ""a bit of a douchebag"" with a score of 50. For the record, I registered a score of 46 or ""quite noisy"" on the KB scale. But instead of hanging my head in shame, I'll blame the medium. Twitter is, after all, is the one-to-many platform where you can sound off on anything. A bit of pride and pretense are bound to spill forth. Well, maybe more than a bit. According to a recent study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon, MIT and Georgia Tech, only around one third of a Twitter feed is actually valued by users. In a survey based on 43,000 responses to find out what people like and loathe about microblog posts, they found that followers described only 36% of the rated tweets as ""Worth Reading."" They thought 25% were ""Not Worth Reading"" and were neutral about the remainder. As for what works and doesn't work on the microblog? According to the study, ""informative"" leads the reasons for liking a tweet. ""Boring"" dominates the reasons for disliking -- scoring higher than ""arrogant"" and ""mean"" combined. So on Twitter, it's worse to be a bore than a douche. Perhaps that can explain the popularity of faux Twitter accounts that celebrate the self-love and pomposity of certain figures in popular culture. There's ""Death Star PR,"" the official mouthpiece for the Galactic Empire. Sample tweet: ""It's a beautiful day to Force choke a few idiots."" And ""The Relevant Organs"" -- a Twitter feed that satirizes a Chinese communist party official with gems like: ""We're confused. What part of intrusive policing, rabid anchormen, pandering websites and fenqing douchery isn't soft power genius?"" ""Not Tilda Swinton"" had been issuing regular missives to her ""Tildren"" on how to achieve the actress's mysterious aura and oneness with nature with tweeted tales like: ""I once waded the entire length of the Nile. I lost an arm to a hippo, but won it back in a game of Charades. I am stronger for it."" Sadly, the fake Twitter account has been retired to keep the joke from getting stale. It's a pity. Sometimes, we need a little douchebaggery in our lives to have a laugh at the self-centeredness of others and, thanks to downward comparison, feel better about ourselves. I went back to Klouchebag to see how I stacked up against Donald Trump on Twitter. I outscored him by a solid 32 points. And there's another 20 bucks in the douche jar.","CNN's Kristie Lu Stout says there's no shortage of douchebaggery on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- A firearm trade group based in Newtown, Connecticut, has filed a lawsuit against Gov. Dannel Malloy and other state lawmakers in hopes of reversing the state's recently passed strict gun control law. In the lawsuit filed Monday, the National Shooting Sports Foundation alleges the Connecticut bill that made history for its tough measures on gun control -- including a ban on the sale and purchase of high capacity magazines -- was illegally introduced and rushed through legislation by Malloy and other lawmakers. The NSSF alleges the bill is in violation of Connecticut's constitution, which states that printed copies of proposed bills must be provided to legislators two days before a vote can take place. Five things to know about guns . The bill, which passed on April 3 and was signed into law by Malloy the following day, banned more than 100 types of assault weapons, called for background checks on all weapon sales -- including private sales -- and created the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry. ""A 139-page bill was assembled behind closed doors, bypassing both the public hearing and committee processes, and quickly sent to floor votes on the same day in both the House and Senate, where legislators did not have adequate time to even read the bill,"" Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president and general counsel of the NSSF, said in a news release. States tighten, loosen gun laws after Newtown . ""Our suit focuses on this abuse of process that has resulted in enacted law that does nothing to improve public safety, while resulting in adverse effects on law-abiding citizens, manufactures, retailers and sportsmen's organizations.""

"Orlando (CNN) -- ""Murderer,"" one e-mail's subject line said. ""Please shoot yourself, you racist piece of sh-t,"" read the body of another e-mail. ""You killed an unarmed teen that you stalked."" And several dictated the same, succinct line: ""Hope you die in prison."" These venom-drenched words are just a smattering of at least 400 e-mails and letters, all sent to George Zimmerman over the past 10 months. Zimmerman, 29, has yet to read the vast majority of these letters; they are retained by his legal counsel in Orlando. His attorneys provided them exclusively to CNN, omitting the senders' names to protect their identities. The majority are either neutral or compassionate, offering moral support and financial contributions to help with Zimmerman's mounting bills. The supportive letters often blame the media for his woes and offer encouragement for the road ahead. Trayvon Martin's parents ready to let jury decide fate of son's killer . Some applaud his lawsuit against NBC over the altering the recording of his police call, allegedly to ""create the myth that George Zimmerman was a racist and predatory villain."" Other missives -- many packed with vitriol and anger -- provide a glimpse into the emotion that overcame the nation when Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a black teen, in Sanford, Florida, exactly one year ago. Like the friendly letters, there are recurring themes: condemnation of Zimmerman's conduct that night, mocking the website he established to collect donations for the legal defense and even ridiculing the physical appearances of him and his wife, Shellie. Zimmerman is vilified as a predator in these letters, while Martin is portrayed as a ""baby"" or ""child."" Dozens are riddled with profanity and crude anatomical references. The outrage erupted when Sanford police at first declined to make an arrest in the shooting. The fury mushroomed as national networks picked up the story. At first, it seemed fairly black and white: Trayvon, an unarmed 17-year-old, was walking to the home of his father's fiancee after a trip to the store for candy and tea when Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchman, saw him and called Sanford police's nonemergency line. Zimmerman described Martin as a ""suspicious guy."" The dispatcher told Zimmerman not to follow the teen -- whether he did is still in dispute -- but the two later encountered each other. Zimmerman fired his weapon, and a bullet to Martin's chest ended the youngster's life. Police would later explain that the dispatcher's imperative was ""not a lawful order that Mr. Zimmerman would be required to follow."" It would turn out to be a more complicated incident altogether, one whose details have yet to emerge completely. Many of the letters to Zimmerman indicate a rush to judgment that many in the nation seemed to embrace in the weeks after the shooting. ""Bottom line is u followed him and got out of your car so it's 100% your fault,"" one sender alleged. 5 things you might have missed about the George Zimmerman saga . ""You shouldn't have continued to pursue him after you were clearly told by the emergency operator to stop following him,"" another said. Despite his myriad detractors, Zimmerman had his supporters as well, and they seemed to sympathize with the plight of a man so concerned about neighborhood break-ins that he bought a gun and dog and donned the mantle of neighborhood watchman. ""His character proves he is a good person and put in charge of trying to keep homes safe,"" one of his supporters said in a handwritten letter. Though Zimmerman is half Hispanic and grew up in a mixed-race family, many of his opponents believed his actions were the product of racial profiling, while others felt the incident was being used to stoke racial tensions. Those sentiments, too, are apparent in the letters . ""You are a RACIST BASTARD, who targeted an innocent Black kid, simply because he was Black,"" one note read. ""You murder a child because of the color of his skin,"" said another. In contrast, others saw the racial controversy as a ginned-up conspiracy to condemn Zimmerman and made references to ""the race-baiting media"" and ""threats by the black community and their leaders."" ""Black people take every opportunity to claim they've been wronged,"" said one letter, while another encouraged Zimmerman to keep his head high: ""Don't let the damn blacks hold you back."" Much of the correspondence Zimmerman received traces the curves of the evolving narrative since February 26, 2012, as previously obscured facts were brought to light and Zimmerman began to tell his side of the story. For instance, a friend who was on the phone with Martin at the time told authorities the teen told her he was being followed. Zimmerman has since said he wasn't pursuing Martin. Rather, he was trying to determine a good street address to give to police. Another example is the shooting itself. While Zimmerman's opponents say he had no cause to shoot Martin, 911 calls indicate there was a struggle that was loud enough to alert neighbors in the townhome community. Opinion: One year later, we remember Trayvon Martin . Someone is heard shouting for help -- accounts vary as to who -- then, on one of the calls, a gunshot is heard. Zimmerman said it was Martin who attacked him, decking him with a punch to the nose before slamming his head repeatedly into the sidewalk. The first images released of Zimmerman -- from a grainy surveillance video -- didn't seem to support the assertion. He seemed clean, uninjured even, many said. But color photos released later -- one of the back of Zimmerman's skull streaked in blood and another showing Zimmerman's swollen nose, blood smeared across his mustache and lip -- raised the possibility he may have been attacked. ""If people claim you attacked and held him down and shot him you wouldn't be injured but you are. That proves to me your story makes more sense,"" read an e-mail from one supporter. Other observers were not convinced. ""Your bloody nose picture only shows that Martin was fighting for his life against an armed man,"" a retired Florida police officer wrote. Claiming self-defense, Zimmerman wasn't arrested immediately. That decision by local police prompted many protests. Thousands rallied and walked out of schools. A specially appointed prosecutor decided to charge Zimmerman with second-degree murder in April, more than six weeks after the shooting, and the Sanford city manager axed Police Chief Bill Lee in June. Now, his defense team is faced with the task of convincing Seminole County Judge Debra Nelson that Zimmerman feared for his life. Many letters to Zimmerman indicate there are plenty of people who have already made up their minds. ""I believe you did what you needed to do I don't don't (sic) think you were wrong you were trying to protect yourself,"" read an e-mail."" ""The fact is that Trayvon physically assaulted another human being, and in a civilized society, you aren't allowed to do that,"" said another supporter. Florida task force: Keep 'stand your ground' Other letters, however, cast Zimmerman as a coward who shot a teen after picking a fight with him. ""You shot trayvon when you were losing to (sic) fight that you started!"" one such e-mail chastised Zimmerman. It continued, ""Think about your nieces and nephews what if they were being followed by a strange male and turned to confront them, got in a fight with them got killed and the man said it was self-defense. May God bless your soul, if you can't see what you did was wrong."" Nelson will decide in April whether Zimmerman can avoid prosecution during an immunity hearing dealing with Florida's now-controversial stand-your-ground law. The law states that people can use deadly force to defend themselves if they believe they are threatened with death or serious bodily harm. Though Martin's supporters question how the law can be invoked under the circumstances in this case, there are those who believe the neighborhood watchman handled himself appropriately. ""Thank you for standing your ground,"" one note said. If Nelson agrees with the stand-your-ground claim, Zimmerman's scheduled June trial will be called off. If she rules against it, the trial will proceed. While many people have steadfast opinions about what happened the night Martin was killed, there are those who feel the situation is still unclear. ""I don't know what actually happened between the two of them. In my 'gut,' I feel it was probably a tragic accident and that they were both in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" read a handwritten letter. Another stated, ""I do not think that you are a racist, just a loose cannon from the 19th century. ... I do not hate you or like you, I am pretty much neutral."" If Nelson sends the case to trial, the next stage will be jury selection. If these last few letters are any indication, there may still be at least a few impartial onlookers amid a sea of passionate opinions.","E-mail, letters to Zimmerman, provided exclusively to CNN, show outrage, support .

"(CNN) -- The man tasked with leading the police department in Sanford, Florida, in the wake of the Trayvon Martin killing said communities should ""take a good, hard look at who is selected,"" for neighborhood watch programs. But, said Sanford's interim Police Chief Richard Myers, he still supports the programs. ""Neighborhood watch is at work in literally thousands of neighborhoods across the country and with no problems whatsoever,"" Myers told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday. ""I think the problems emerge from who the person is and perhaps there's a cause for communities to take a good, hard look at who is selected or who volunteers. ""Let's not kill the concept because of one bad, really bad outcome."" Myers, a former police chief from Colorado Springs, Colorado, took the post Friday. He said he has plans to help the department that has been under the microscope since the February 26 killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin was black; Zimmerman is Hispanic. ""I'm here to help the community. There's a lot of healing that has to take place,"" Myers said. ""I'm here to help the department get some stability."" His predecessor, Bill Lee, stepped aside as chief after a vote of no-confidence by city commissioners in April, clearing the way for Myers. The Martin case drew nationwide protests when Sanford police decided against arresting Zimmerman, who told investigators he killed Martin in self-defense. A special prosecutor assigned to look into Martin's death ultimately brought second-degree murder charges against the 28-year-old Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty and is out on a $150,000 bail. Myers, a 35-year law enforcement veteran, acknowledged the Sanford police department needs to rebuild its relationship with African-Americans in the area. ""One of my major goals is to try and strengthen the relationship that Sanford police have with all elements of the community, especially the African-American community,"" he said. ""In America today, there still exists a great deal of unresolved tension about race and policing and I have a particular passion for working on those issues and helping to resolve conflict. So whether or not that was a factor in this case, it certainly is a factor in some tension that exists. We're going to work on that."" Myers began his career in the suburbs of Detroit and Chicago before becoming chief of the Appleton, Wisconsin, police department. After that, he took the reins of the Colorado Springs police department in 2007. Myers resigned that post in 2011. Myers is supposed to spend a three- to five-month stint leading the Sanford department, city officials have said.","Richard Myers, a 35-year veteran, is expected to serve for three to five months .

"(CNN) -- Nothing better sums up Africa's extraordinary mixture of challenges and opportunities than agriculture. On the one hand, Africa is home to one in four of the world's hungry and is the only continent which fails to grow enough food to meet its own needs. Yet it has also half of the world's unused land suitable for farming. Better still, increasing yields on existing farmland by 50% -- still far below the global average -- would not only meet Africa's own food requirements but provide a sizable surplus for export. With global food supply needing to increase by an estimated 70% by 2050, the continent is at the heart of the challenge of food security. All this explains why agriculture in Africa is finally getting the attention it deserves from both the continent's governments and donors. The recent Nutrition for Growth summit generated pledges of $4.1 billion to fight malnutrition and hunger. This builds on the commitments made at Camp David 12 months ago when we, along with other local and multinational companies, committed to collectively invest over $3 billion across the agricultural value chain in Grow Africa countries. There is now increased pressure on G8 leaders, meeting this week in the UK, to tackle the issues at the heart of food insecurity, including ""land grabs."" Read this: African land grabs, mirage in the desert . In the worst cases, local communities and farmers have been evicted from land they long regarded as their own. Farmland which was once productive can be left idle. Plans to grow crops for export in the future can also be difficult to stomach when local people don't have food to eat today. Land purchases which ignore the interests of local communities and the local landscapes are both morally wrong and commercially short-sighted. We need action both nationally and globally to stop them. But there is a danger that these clear-cut cases fuel opposition to all outside investment or create a false choice between large-scale commercial farming and smallholders. The truth is Africa desperately needs to maximize the potential of both to meet the needs of its citizens. With smallholder farmers still producing 80% of the food and supporting 65% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, they are central to any successful sustainable solution. We need to lift the barriers which have seen them locked out of the developments in agriculture from which farmers around the world have long benefited. Where this has happened, the results can be remarkable. Read this: Africa can feed itself in a generation . As a company, we have been working with African farmers for many years. We buy our raw materials from all sorts of farming systems, from large-scale commercial barley farmers right through to near-subsistence cassava farmers who we are keen to help become viable commercial operators -- and at least half of the grains we use come from local farmers. The challenge for all who want to see African agriculture drive prosperity for its people is to maximize the benefits which both smallholder and large-scale commercial farming can bring. There is no single answer to preventing land grabs but at the heart of any solution is the need to improve land rights. It is no coincidence that many of the most questionable acquisitions have taken place in countries with the weakest system of land rights in place. As much as 90% of the land in sub-Sahara Africa is untitled. The result is that communities which may have lived and farmed the land for many generations have no enforceable legal claim to it. In the worst cases, this can allow land to be sold off by governments from under their feet without any hope of compensation. Read this: Land grabs really water grabs? Improved land rights which go at least some way to recognize history and usage would help prevent this from happening. Nor is it impossible to put in place. Countries such as Botswana and Ghana have already improved their laws so customarily held lands have the force of private property. Giving people the protection of legally enforceable land rights does not only give them security. It also gives them greater incentive to invest in their farms and an easier route to get this investment. The lack of legal paperwork to their land remains a major reason for the refusal of banks to lend to farmers. Improving land rights would also help commercial organizations who want to invest and farm in a responsible way. The present position gives us the worst of all worlds. While bad investors can get away with riding roughshod over the rights of smallholders and communities, the present free-for-all makes it difficult for good investors who want to farm in a way which is beneficial to local people and the environment from accessing land. It is not just weak land rights which are holding back African agriculture, and the solutions are complex and multi-faceted. But work to put in place a fair and enforceable system would be a major step to helping the continent fulfill its rich potential. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of Mark Bowman.","G8 leaders under pressure to tackle food security, says Mark Bowman .
National and international action is needed to stop land grabs, he says .
But Africa needs both large-scale commercial farming and smallholders, he adds .

"(CNN) -- Another day, another reason to cheer -- after a week of tears. Five days after 19 firefighters died while battling it, the Yarnell Hill Fire northwest of Phoenix, Arizona, was 90% contained, official Twitter and Facebook pages tied to the firefighting effort reported Friday evening. That's an upgrade from the 80% containment from earlier in the day, and well above the 45% mark Thursday. Authorities had announced they'd expected the blaze to fully under control by July 12, though it now seems they are ahead of schedule. Still, there's a lot of recovery to do -- physically, economically and emotionally. The latter is tied largely to the sudden deaths last Sunday of 19 members of Prescott Fire Department's Granite Mountain Hotshots, in what ended up being the deadliest day for U.S. firefighters since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack in New York. The fallen firefighters: Who they where . Officials have said it appears that, after conditions changed rapidly, the 19 lied down under fire shelters -- blankets meant to protect against flames and heat as a last resort against an inferno. But the flames overwhelmed them, and all died. ""As far as we can tell, that this tragedy was not something that was preventable,"" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said on Friday. ""A freak movement of wind shift that took place is the primary cause."" They will be remembered Tuesday at a memorial service at Tim's Toyota Center in Prescott Valley that will be attended by, among others, Vice President Joe Biden, according to McCain. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . These weren't the only fatalities of firefighters battling wildfires this week. In an unrelated incident Friday morning in California, a firefighter died when a passing car struck him while he was working along Interstate 10 in the Thousand Palms area of Riverside County, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Authorities later identified the apparatus engineer/paramedic as 41-year-old Christopher Douglas, a Temecula resident and 8-year veteran of CalFire who is survived by his wife and 2-year-old son. As to the Yarnell Hill Fire, it was sparked June 28 by lightning some 3.5 miles west of Yarnell, according to Inciweb, a federal website that disseminates information from agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. How to help the families . It eventually scorched at least 8,400 acres. According to the Yarnell Fire District, homes or structures at 129 addresses were lost and many residents were ordered to evacuate. Since it erupted, and particularly since the firefighters' death, many in the area have rallied behind one another. The Arizona Diamondbacks Foundation, the charitable arm of the state's Major League Baseball team, announced that it is donating $200,000 on top of more than $100,000 that its fans donated in a four-day span. Prescott's annual Fourth of July celebration took on special meaning, including a display of 19 solitary, purple fireworks rising into the sky in memory of each man killed. Christina Johnson, a Prescott resident, told CNN affiliate KPHO that she felt it was important to remember the ""honorable men (who) died to protect us and our property"" -- something she said was important for them, their families and the community at large. ""Prescott is a wonderful city, full of caring people, and I think it's brought the town together more,"" she said. ""It's unbelievable. It's such a loss.""

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, the Florida neighborhood watch volunteer at the center of a national firestorm over racial profiling, crime and gun rights, gave his first television interview on Wednesday, saying he had to act after Trayvon Martin said ""you are going to die tonight"" and reached for Zimmerman's gun holster. Zimmerman sat for an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity and expressed his regrets to the parents of Martin, 17. He said he is neither a racist nor a murderer. Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder for shooting Martin in what he says was self-defense. Martin was unarmed when he was killed in February while walking back to his father's girlfriend's house in a gated residential area of Sanford, Florida. The watch volunteer said he can't now second-guess what happened. ""I feel it was all God's plan,"" Zimmerman said Wednesday. Investigator: Zimmerman missed opportunities to defuse situation . Martin's family in a statement, said Zimmerman ""does not regret anything he did that night."" ""We must worship a different God because there is no way that my God would have wanted G. Zimmerman to kill my teenage son,"" father Tracy Martin said. Zimmerman, who said he routinely carried a gun except when he was at work, told Hannity that Martin appeared to be suspicious as he cut between buildings. Zimmerman said he moved toward a different area when police told him not to continue following the young man. That's when he said Martin approached him, his body language ""confrontational."" ""He asked me what my problem was,"" Zimmerman said. ""I said I did not have a problem."" When he reached for his cell phone, Zimmerman said, Martin punched his nose and broke it. Zimmerman said he didn't know whether he fell or was pushed to the ground. Martin straddled him and told him to shut up during their struggle, he said. ""He started bashing my head into the concrete sidewalk. As as he broke my nose I started yelling for help. I was disoriented,"" he said. Zimmerman said it was his voice caught on a phone call screaming for help. ""(Martin) started to try to suffocate me and I continued to push his hands off my mouth and nose."" He said he was concerned he would lose consciousness. Zimmerman told Hannity he had to shoot Martin when the latter told him he was going to die and made a move for Zimmerman's handgun. Zimmerman, who apologized to Martin's parents during an April bond hearing, again expressed regret Wednesday. ""My wife and I don't have any children. I have nephews that I love more than life. I love them more than myself. And I know when they were born, it was a different unique bond and love that I have with them,"" Zimmerman told Fox. ""And I love my children even though that they aren't born yet. I am sorry that they buried their child. I can't imagine what it must feel like. And I pray for them daily."" Witness alleges she was abused by suspect in Trayvon Martin killing . The 28-year-old has pleaded not guilty and has been free on $1 million bond since early July. He had been granted bail in April, then had it revoked after a judge found Zimmerman and his wife, Shellie Zimmerman, had failed to disclose more than $150,000 in donations from the public among their assets. Police have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there was no evidence to disprove his account that he had acted in self-defense. A police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head. A special prosecutor who took over the investigation eventually found that Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, racially profiled Martin, an African-American, and ignored a police dispatcher's instructions to stop following Martin. Zimmerman was arrested in April on the murder charge. His wife was arrested on a perjury charge related to the donations in June. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara told Hannity that he could not comment on the donations, given the case against Shellie Zimmerman. He did say the case against his client would be an appropriate example of a ""stand your ground"" defense in Florida. Zimmerman said he had not heard of the law before the incident. He also said the media has made a rush to judgment. Zimmerman asks for another new judge . Witnesses tell FBI that George Zimmerman is no racist . Timeline of events in Trayvon Martin case .

"(CNN) -- French prosecutors in Lille asked Tuesday for charges to be dropped against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn over his alleged participation in a prostitution ring, citing a lack of evidence. Strauss-Kahn was among a number charged with aggravated pimping in an investigation into sex parties at the Hotel Carlton in the northern city of Lille. Read more: How DSK's fall led to Hollande's rise . He did not deny attending the parties, his lawyers said, but he did not know that the young women at the parties were being paid for sex. The case is known in France as the ""Carlton affair."" A judge will decide whether to act on the recommendations of the office of the Lille prosecutor. The prosecutor also asked for charges to be dropped against a second man accused in the case, Jean-Luc Vergin, also on the grounds of insufficient evidence. However, 12 people should be called before the correctional tribunal for acts that will likely be qualified as aggravated pimping, and for a few of them, fraud, abuse of trust and abuse of public funds, a statement from the prosecutor's office said. Investigating judges filed their 6,800-page dossier with the prosecutor's office in March this year, two years after the investigation was opened by the Lille courthouse into aggravated pimping charges. Allegations denied . Strauss-Khan, a 64-year-old economist, was widely expected to become the Socialist presidential candidate -- until his professional career imploded with an arrest in New York in May 2011. A New York hotel housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, told police that a naked Strauss-Kahn emerged from a room of his spacious luxury hotel suite and tried to force himself on her, at one point dragging her into the bathroom and trying to remove her underwear. Strauss-Kahn alleged the encounter was consensual, but stepped down from his $500,000 job at the IMF. A grand jury indicted him on seven counts, including sexual abuse and attempted rape, but prosecutors later dropped the charges after concluding Diallo had lied about some details of the alleged attack -- despite forensic evidence that showed a sexual encounter had occurred. Diallo then sued Strauss-Kahn. The two sides reached a settlement late last year, the details of which have not been disclosed. Last October, a French prosecutor dropped an investigation connecting Strauss-Kahn to a possible gang rape in Washington. The young Belgian woman whose testimony was the basis for the inquiry withdrew her previous statement and said she would not press charges, leaving the investigation with no grounds to continue, officials said. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape in 2003 against a young French writer, Tristane Banon. But prosecutors said the case could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander. CNN's Alexander Felton contributed to this report.","Dominique Strauss-Kahn was investigated over sex parties at the Hotel Carlton in Lille .

"(CNN) -- Here's what we know about Saturday's crash landing of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 and some of the key questions raised by those facts: . 1. A preliminary readout from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders shows the aircraft was approaching well below the target landing speed of 137 knots (157 mph). Records from the flight data recorder show that at 500 feet of altitude and 34 seconds before impact, the aircraft had already slowed to 134 knots (154 mph). At seven seconds before impact, the pilots attempted to spool up the engines. At four seconds, the stall warning sounded. At 1.5 seconds, the pilots tried to abort the landing and go around to attempt another landing. At impact, the flight data recorder shows the aircraft had a forward speed of a mere 106 knots (121 mph). What we don't know: Why was the aircraft approaching so slowly? Did the pilot not realize he was short? Girls killed in crash were headed for camp . 2. Asiana said the pilot at the controls was making his first landing of a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport. While a pilot with more than 10,000 hours of experience, including many hours flying Boeing 747s, he had only 43 hours of flying time in a 777. What we don't know: Did pilot inexperience with the aircraft play a role? Why did the captain not speak up or take control? 3. The NTSB investigators have found nothing to corroborate online flight tracking records showing that Asiana Flight 214 descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous Asiana flights on the same route. The NTSB says it found no ""abnormally steep descent data."" 4. Part of the instrument landing system approach on Runway 28L was not working on the day of the crash. It had been down for some time. Flights were landing using visual flight rules. The weather was clear. The flight data shows the autopilot was disengaged at 1,600 feet and the pilot then took manual control of the plane. What we don't know: Did the lack of ILS force the pilot to make a VFR landing in an aircraft with which he was not fully familiar? 5. The runway's precision approach path indicator lights, showing correct flight approach altitudes, were working. What we don't know: Why didn't the pilot recognize he was too low for the approach and initiate a go-around earlier? 6. Based on the debris field and the video obtained by CNN, the aircraft appears to have struck the rock sea wall well before the start of the runway. There are some marks on the sea wall, consistent with an impact of some part of the plane. 7. The debris field runs from the water, slightly right of the paved threshold and runway center, all the way to the stopped aircraft fuselage. The NTSB says pieces of the rear of the aircraft are in the water near the seawall, visible at low tide. 8. The Boeing 777 lost its tail section, including vertical and horizontal stabilizers, near the end of the paved threshold, just before the start of the runway. What we don't know: Is this an indication the tail of the aircraft detached after first impact? 9. The right engine is detached from the wing and wedged against the right side of the fuselage. The left engine is a considerable distance forward of the fuselage in a grassy area to the right of Runway 28L. The NTSB says both engines had high rotational damage, showing that they were powering at impact. 10. Most of the fire damage to the aircraft occurred after the Boeing 777 came to a stop on its belly. 11. Passengers described the cabin interior as heavily damaged, with overhead bins dropping and at least one life raft/escape slide inflating inside the aircraft, trapping a flight attendant, whom passengers helped free. The NTSB says it will investigate the structural safety of the seats. 12. The coroner says one of the two passengers killed appears to have been run over by an emergency vehicle, though the coroner had not yet determined the cause of death. Asiana has identified the fatalities as Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia of China, both of whom were 16. 13. Audio recordings of air traffic control conversations show no sign that the pilot declared an emergency before the crash landing. Emergency vehicles were dispatched afterward. 14. The aircraft was built in 2006 and was purchased new by Asiana. 15. The NTSB was planning to interview the four pilots Monday afternoon. Key information from those interviews will be made public at Tuesday's briefing. First responders describe eerie, chaotic moments . Why so many people survived . CNN's Dan Simon and Richard Quest contributed to this report.","Airline: Pilot was making first landing in control of a Boeing 777 at San Francisco airport .

Boxers Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez appeared in Alamo Plaza on Monday night to promote their September 14 super-welterweight title fight in Las Vegas. ""This would not happen at Gettysburg. No one would even imagine holding such an event at the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor,"" Patterson said. ""It should be treated as the hallowed ground that it is.""

"(EW.com) -- Gru, the bald and beetle-browed rascal hero of ""Despicable Me 2,"" is an infectious imp â€” as voiced by Steve Carell, he's like Uncle Fester with the personality of Nikita Khrushchev. But in the first ""Despicable Me"" (2010), he was a supervillain with a grand plan (he wanted to steal the moon), and in the surprisingly toothless sequel, he has been neutered into a boring nice guy. The co-directors, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, create a seductively tactile computer-animated landscape in which gentle slapstick rules the day. For some reason, though, they have mostly left out the flashes of egomaniacal dastardliness that even a movie for kids can thrive on (e.g., the far superior Will Ferrell animation Megamind). Kristen Wiig voices Lucy, the Anti-Villain League agent who has a crush on Gru and recruits him to be a spy. You keep waiting for Wiig to display some of her flaked-out inspiration, but she, too, has been given almost nothing to play but sweetness and light. The best thing in the movie is the army of chattery yellow minions who are injected with a serum that transforms them into gnashing purple beasties. By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that ""Despicable Me 2"" betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety.

"(CNN) -- If I can help one person battling this disease, who's fighting for his or her life, stay positive by being stronger, then my goal has been accomplished. Finding inner strength at a time when being strong seems like such an impossibility is what can pull you through cancer. The kids at Seattle Children's Hospital got me out of bed on days that I wouldn't want to. Kids are resilient. They'd knock on my door and force me out of bed. Force me to walk -- with tubes in their noses, barf buckets resting on tricycle handlebars, beads of courage clinking from their IV poles. THAT was awesome. Every day was a lesson. It's a lesson no one is prepared for, and ironically, you have no time to prepare. You are thrown into this, this nightmare, and within hours, your life, your plans, your goals, your future has completely changed. My proudest moment was during a scary clinic visit when I toyed with going into septic shock. My fever spiked, and my blood pressure plummeted -- never a good combination with no immune system. I was minutes away from ICU, and I don't know what happened, but I rallied and fought, and my numbers turned around. The most awesome moment was walking out of the hospital for the last time. Done. Never looking back. People need to know what goes on behind the walls on the oncology floor. It's the scariest, most wonderful place you could ever observe. A monumental will to live. A child's naivete. A parent's reality, holding onto a tiny thread of hope. These kids exude strength, and it was their courageous fight that made ME stronger.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Managing expenses on the road doesn't have to be a struggle, even in the most expensive city in the world. And what Oslo loses in costliness, it easily makes up with nature. The city sits on the innermost part of the Oslo Fjord, with forested hills, more than 40 islands and 343 lakes. For the best views catch a ferry from Vippetangen. Or better still take a cruise. The Oslo Pass, that provides access to 33 museums as well as free travel on public transport, also offers a free lunch cruise on board a traditional wooden sailing ship. You get a Norwegian prawn buffet as part of the deal and two-hour trip around the city's islands and lakes. Boats leave at 10.30, 13.00 and 15.30. (http://www.norwayyachtcharter.com/). Oslo's most visited site is Vigeland Park that houses more than 200 huge, some say Rodin-esque, sculptures by celebrated Norwegian artist Gustav Vigeland. The park is 2km from the city center and it's open seven days a week. It's also free. Other free museums and attractions include the Nasjonalgalleriet with one of the original series of Edvard Munch's The Scream; the Astrup Fearnley museum for modern art with its own Damien Hirst; and the botanical gardens. To reward a day's cost cutting, and for the best sunset in town, try a seafood platter at restaurant, Solsiden (Søndre Akershus Kai 34, phone 23-33-36-30). It may not be the cheapest spot in town, but the evening sunset is worth the extra cost. The restaurant opens onto a pier looking over the Aker Brygge complex, a former shipyard area and now a hub for restaurants and bars. But this is a summer spot only, and closes between September and April.","For the best views of Oslo Fjord catch a lunch cruise on a wooden sailing ship .

"(CNN) -- David Weir is to Paralympic wheelchair racing in the United Kingdom as Michael Phelps is to swimming in the United States. Meeting this unassuming 33-year-old, you wouldn't know that he's one of the winningest British Paralympic athletes on Team GB. But Weir's victories -- six gold, two silver and two bronze medals and six London Marathon wins -- didn't come easily for him. Born with a spinal cord transection (shearing or compression of the spinal cord) that left him with feeling in his legs but no movement, Weir had to carve his own path to becoming the sports star he always hoped he could be. CNN sat down with Weir after a recent training session in London: . CNN: What was it about sports that always appealed to you? David Weir: My family was very sports-oriented. My brothers were boxers -- one was professional; one was amateur. I just got the bug for sports at an early age. So I used to go see them fight when I was like 4 years old. I decided I wanted to do sports, but obviously I couldn't do boxing or football, which were my love, so I had to find a sport that was suitable for my needs. CNN: You've won 10 Paralympic medals; you've won the London Marathon six times, and you've won the New York Marathon. What drives you? Weir: I don't know really. I thought I wouldn't have any drive left after London. And I think it's just the way I ran my races. I won them convincingly, with a big gap. I didn't win them by millimeters or (a) photo finish like I've done previous years leading up to London. When I started fully focusing (on) training for London, and training with the cyclists you've seen today, I got that extra bit out of me. After the games, I watched my races back and saw that I was winning by a good margin, and I think that just showed me that ""Hold up, Dave, there's still a bit of life in you."" London 2012 delivers unexpected legacy . CNN: You're working on starting an academy with your coach Jenny Archer to help train future wheelchair athletes. Why? Weir: I'm just more of a mentor -- I try and get down there as much as I can, but Jenny is the one that does the full program; she's brilliant with them. I'm just there to encourage them really, give them advice and tactics, and a way to push and way to sit in their racing chair, because I've got a lot of knowledge over the years. So I'm just trying to give back what I know to the next generation coming through because Great Britain has a great tradition of wheelchair racers over the years, so I don't want to see it die. So I'm trying to give back what I had as a youngster. CNN: You're David Weir the athlete, but there's also David Weir the father. What do your kids think about all of this? Weir: Well, my youngest children haven't got a clue at the moment because they're too young, but my oldest girl who's 10 -- she's so proud and happy for me, and obviously my girlfriend is so supportive. They're just the world to me. It's another training tool -- when Mason was born and if I'd have a bad training session, I'd go back and see his smiley, happy face, and I would forget about that training session and move on to the next day. CNN: Any plans for Rio in 2016? Weir: Each month as it gets closer, I seem to change my mind if I'm going to Rio. I want to do small targets first, really. I'll be 34 this year. I need to have an offish year so I can do what races I really want to do. But I'm going to have a two-year target, I think, because I think if I say yes, I'm definitely in for Rio. It's a lot of pressure on me, and four years is a long time when you're 34. So I'm going to take each year as it comes really, and make my decision near the time I think, but if you asked me six, seven months ago, I would have said no way -- London was my last big target. We'll see how it goes -- if I can still win races and perform at a high level, I can't see why not. We'll see. Come and ask me in six months' time; I'll probably give you a totally different answer then.","Paralympic wheelchair racer David Weir was born with a spinal cord transection .

"New York (CNN) -- If the Americans followed the French presidential elections as avidly as the French stare at the poll ratings of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, they would know that ""Sarko l'Américain,"" Sarkozy the American, may soon have to say ""good bye"" to the Elysée Palace. The omens are bad and the possible demise of the most pro-American president in our history raises questions about our long and complex transatlantic relations. How will French election be decided? Not that there is so much to worry about. Sarkozy's potential successor, the Socialist François Hollande, may have said that ""the enemy is finance,"" but he also told the New York Times that before attending l'Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the alma mater of our elite public service, he had traveled to the United States and written a report on the American fast food industry that foresaw the triumph of McDonald's in France a decade later. The candidate even admitted a personal weakness for hamburgers -- a strategic cliché America is welcome to take as a token of transatlantic loyalty. But it is not always enough. Remember Jacques Chirac? Our former president gained real popularity in the U.S. after telling Larry King that in his youth he had worked as a soda jerk at a Howard Johnson hotel, and even dangerously overextended his vacations to date a southern belle who called him ""Honey Chile"" and drove him around in a white Cadillac convertible. All this sincere devotion to Americana didn't spare him from being reviled later as the commander-in-chief of the ""Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys"", unwilling to risk blood and treasure in the quest of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Tons of ""Freedom Fries,"" the creative rants of Bill O'Reilly and George W. Bush, even the sad visit to the White House in 2004 of our then ambassador to check officially on the status of France (""Friend or Foe?"") are enough proof that our relations can become sour and chaotic overnight. But hateful? No. It's just ... complicated. Colin Powell, the man in the middle in 2004, sincerely thought America and France could form a bona fide couple, be it ""in therapy for the last 60 years."" And if the first rule of therapy is to verbalize, France has been vocal, to say the least. The official French explanation is that we both have strong and ""radiating"" cultures. The reality is that history has not made us equal. And it is sometimes painful. It was made worse, and personal, by World War II, when Presidents Roosevelt and Truman didn't embrace Charles De Gaulle, the only remnant of dignity of a battered country and the only symbolic redemption of a past that included a shaming defeat, a cruel occupation and the moral abyss of collaboration by Vichy and French police. Sure, America saved us. But it is sometimes hard to be saved, especially when your savior doesn't seem to take you very seriously. No wonder the French flirted with grandiosity in the 1960s. The interior conquest made up for the loss of a colonial empire. The social protection, the nuclear show of force, the state-owned companies, the glowing technocratic elite and appeals to the developing world confirmed the victorious march of our ""Third Way"" between Washington and Moscow. It is one of the reasons why, in contrast to most other western countries, the French conservative parties and its establishment never saw the American entrepreneurial way of business as a suitable model. It was even seen as a little vulgar. The change came with Sarkozy. His bourgeois but simple upbringing, his father's foreign origin made him an unlikely candidate for the elite and all the more sensitive to the growth, creativity and class promotion promised by the American capitalism and meritocracy. He was also the first to suggest a system of affirmative action for the young descendants of immigrants locked in ghettos by decades of neglect and racism. But ""Sarko"" became less American after the collapse of the markets in 2008, less prone to show to France, as a model, a country where citizens actually demonstrate against government-run healthcare, less inclined to diversity when he needed the extreme right vote for his re-election. There was also a disappointment. If our president had gotten along much better than Chirac with George W. Bush since 2007, he had great hopes to bask in the world aura of Obama, and even to replace the British as the closest ally of the United States. That did not happen. A rational and aloof Obama kept the unprecedented French love fest at bay. ""The most American of the two is not who you would think,"" a diplomat whispered to me after one of their first meetings, strangely mixing admiration, irony and plain old stereotypes. Once again, France seemed to need the big mirror across the Atlantic to shape its identity and solve its anxieties. A colleague swore to me that Jean Dujardin's Oscar for ""The Artist"" would offset the loss of our triple-A credit rating. In the middle of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn sex scandal last year, half of the French sneered at the ""American Puritanism"" and its disgusting Perp Walks. The other half admired a country that would treat a rich and powerful man as badly as the common man. But both sides agreed to buy a magazine cover story that asked: ""The Americans, What do they think of us?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philippe Coste.","Possible demise of pro-U.S. French President Sarkozy raises questions over complex relations .
Love for U.S. not always enough to ensure U.S. respect for France, says Philippe Coste .
He says sometimes France's WW2 savior, U.S, doesn't seem to take it very seriously .
Sarkozy had vainly hoped to replace British as closest ally of U.S."
"(CNN) -- More than ever, the French are thinking and hearing about sex. Sex in high places, for a change. The thick wall that separated the public and private lives of our ruling elite and kept their backstage manners out of the headlines is now crumbling at a fast pace. And the Dominique Strauss-Kahn earthquake has a lot to do with it. Two criminal cases against the former director of the International Monetary Fund, one closed in New York, the other still pending in northern France after his indictment for alleged promotion of prostitution, have given the press more than an opportunity, a civic obligation to tip-toe around our strict privacy laws and question, for the first time, their cozy gentleman's agreement with the powerful. Now what? Things are changing. Today, Jean Quatremer, a journalist at the daily Liberation, tells in his new book how, nearly four years ago, he got the scoop about the opening of an internal investigation at the IMF on DSK's relationship with a subordinate; and how his editors of the time killed the story. (The Wall Street Journal finally got the tip). Until this year, also, excellent journalists at Le Monde like Raphael Bacqué and Ariane Chemin would not have found a publisher willing to release their own book, ""Les Strauss-Kahn,"" a chronicle of the life of DSK and his famous journalist wife Anne Sinclair. Now a best-seller, their investigation certainly describes numerous flavors of Strauss-Kahn's behavior. But it deals more with another relationship, the bizarre ménage à trois between the elite circles, French citizens and the truth. In France, centuries of feudal privileges did not disappear at the birth of the Fifth Republic. In the last 40 years, most privacy laws were created not by the demand of citizens fearing the Big Brother state, but rather by the political class itself, to keep its safe distance from the electorate. And self-censorship ruled. In a recent documentary (about DSK) a French media critic recalled the time when, as a rookie in 1982, he asked a seasoned correspondent at the Elysée what President Mitterrand did after work. The answer came, in a blasé voice that hinted at a banal routine: ""He leaves his office around 6:30. Then, he just spends the evening with his second family."" This fact was made public only in 1994, when Mitterrand gave a green light for a cover picture in Paris Match showing his beloved daughter with him. Just over a year later, she was at his funeral with her mother, an act of public regal recognition that moved the nation. Strauss-Kahn, like other avatars of the system, reveled in his own kind of aristocratic and exclusive playground. Silence and immunity became the measure, the flattering reflection of his growing power and nobility. His demise in France could be seen as the symbolic start of a new era of openness, but we are still in an awkward transition period, where the French public opinion is trying hard to find its mark. Until Nicolas Sarkozy, no president had ever divorced, out of fear it would irritate the shrinking number of Roman Catholics in the electorate, or open a Pandora's Box of distasteful revelations; but sexual morality has never been a reliable electoral criterion. Rumors on the internet have upstaged uncertain values, fed cynicism and the rise of populist movements, a blanket ideology of the ""Tous Pourris"" (they are all rotten) at the core of the extreme right-wing psyche. But in the current confusion, many French would prefer to maintain good old privacy, especially in its male-friendly version. During the Strauss-Kahn epic, for example, women who dared to connect the dots between his character flaws and eligibility for office, saying they would not vote for a misogynist, were often ridiculed as nuns or man-haters. Most people, in spite of the current publishing frenzy, would rather know less, and keep power on its safe pedestal. That trend started before Strauss-Kahn, when Sarkozy, dumped by his second wife right after his election in 2007, had to become the president next door, and rebuild his life ""live"" with glamorous Carla Bruni. Ironically, for acting like a mere mortal, be it on prime time, in luxurious and idyllic conditions, he was accused of desecrating the presidency : Too visible, too ""bling bling,"" too out of touch. His successor, François Hollande, won as ""Mr Normal."" But his life is far from uneventful. His separation with his companion Segolène Royal, a prominent socialist, a former presidential candidate and mother of his four children, totally disturbed their party in 2007. His flame ever since, now the First Lady, named Valerie Trierweiler, a journalist, is still so consumed by jealousy that she tweeted her support for Segolène's political opponent during the last parliamentary elections. Her move, a cyber-age rendition of 18th century boudoir warfare, openly contributed to the defeat of her nemesis, ruining her chances to become the President of the Assemblée Nationale. The truth is out now, but it is not certain the French like it that way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philippe Coste.","Philippe Coste: The DSK cases have given the press the chance to question the powerful .

"New York (CNN) -- The street artist who created the iconic red, white and blue Obama ""Hope"" posters in the lead-up to the 2008 presidential election was sentenced Friday to two years' probation after tampering with evidence, prosecutors said. Shepard Fairey pleaded guilty in February to criminal contempt of court for falsifying and destroying documents and coaching a witness while embroiled in a copyright infringement battle over his use of a now-famous image by The Associated Press that featured then-Sen. Barack Obama. Fairey was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines in a dispute that dates back to 2009, when he brought a federal lawsuit against AP, claiming that he was entitled to use the image under the fair use doctrine, according to a statement by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The guidelines are a copyright exception allowing reproductions in specific instances of news reporting, commentary, teaching and other situations. ""I accept full responsibility for violating the court's trust by tampering with evidence during my civil case with (The) Associated Press, which, after my admitting to engaging in this conduct, led to this criminal case by the Southern District of New York,"" Fairey said in a written statement. ""I accept the judge's sentence and look forward to finally putting this episode behind me."" Federal prosecutors said Fairey, 42, lied about which AP image of Obama he used as inspiration for the posters, which were stamped with the words ""Hope"" and ""Progress."" ""After spending a great amount of time, energy and legal effort, all of us at The Associated Press are glad this matter is finally behind us,"" said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. ""We hope this case will serve as a clear reminder to all of the importance of fair compensation for those who gather and produce original news content."" In his civil complaint, Fairey claimed to have used a photo taken of Obama and actor George Clooney by an AP photographer in 2006, though he actually used a different AP image -- a close-up of the current president, prosecutors said. The federal court found Fairey had both destroyed documents that would prove that he had not used the photo of Obama and Clooney, and created false ones in an attempt to back the claims he made in his complaint. ""My wrong-headed actions, born out of a moment of fear and embarrassment, have not only been financially and psychologically costly to myself and my family, but also helped to obscure what I was fighting for in the first place -- the ability of artists everywhere to be inspired and freely create art without reprisal,"" Fairey said. According to court documents, Fairey and AP settled the civil suit in January 2011 for $1.6 million.","Shepard Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court in February .

"(CNN) -- Concussions and the link to CTE have captured the headlines once again, with Junior Seau's family filing a lawsuit against the NFL. They believe the brain damage Seau suffered during his 20 years in the league led to his suicide. Then, in a recent interview with ""New Republic"" magazine, President Barack Obama tackled the culture of violence in football and the impact the game takes on its players. Obama stated, as much of a fan he is of football, ""If I had a son, I would have to think long and hard before I let him play football."" And yet, the most captivating and exciting news for me is the recent early findings based on the studies out of UCLA. For the first time, researchers used a brain imaging tool to identify abnormalities in the brains of a handful of living former NFL athletes. Previously, these abnormalities could only be studied after a player died. This is a possible breakthrough that could revolutionize how we view and treat concussion injuries on all levels of contact sports. It could save lives and provide families of athletes a degree of emotional stability, since symptoms of CTE may appear within months or many decades after the trauma. I knew Seau personally, and I was also a colleague of Dave Duerson at Voice America Sports. The most unsettling thing about the deaths of Seau and Duerson was not that these men tragically took their own lives, but that on the outside the people closest to them could not see that they were suffering -- and the next day they were no longer here. A tale of two former NFL players . I always wonder, ""Does it really happen that fast, and will I one day not be able to see it myself?"" These questions can haunt a father of a 5-year-old boy, especially when I think about his future if he should decide to emulate his father with career on the gridiron. The possibility of early detection of CTE and any possible prevention of him suffering from CTE is an extremely exciting prospect. My journey through the process of sending in my paperwork was not only an emotional decision, but also one which had to be handled in a very calculated manner. So begins the battle of the logic versus emotion for anyone in the position to make such a huge decision with an unknown future. The process of committing yourself to such a study is one that you do not take alone. Commitment to this study requires my signature along with the signature of a family member who may not fully understand the reasoning behind the decision. This can make you overthink your decision. Family members, because of the publicity around CTE and suicide, may assume that you are not mentally stable and are on the verge of taking drastic measures. Each family dynamic is different, but what I learned in this process is that like every other important issue, when it comes to someone you deeply care about, communication is key. That communication has to happen, whether it is a spouse, sibling, parent or in my case, my grandmother, who is the true matriarch of the Campbell family. I had this discussion face-to-face with my grandmother, who felt blindsided and concerned for my safety when she first read the papers. I explained to her that this decision was not just about me, but that donating my brain was my way of giving back to my brothers on the field. I reminded my grandmother that a passion for giving back is something she instilled in me at a young age, and that's what influenced my decision to sign the paperwork and have it sent to Boston University School of Medicine. Once she understood my thought process, she signed the papers, too. This new UCLA study can be a turning point, not just for NFL athletes, but all male and female athletes who play contact sports. It gives us hope that tragic losses associated with CTE can be prevented. It gives us hope that treatment might be implemented at an early stage for current and future athletes. The time has passed for casting blame on what precautions were or were not taken to prevent concussions and CTE. It's time to start the process of making sure that the building blocks of preventive measures take place to guarantee that concussions will never just be looked at as just another consequence of the game.","Lamar Campbell knew Junior Seau and worked with Dave Duerson .

"(CNN) -- Actor Ashton Kutcher, who got his break on ""That '70s Show,"" will go back to the 1970s to play tech visionary Steve Jobs in an indie film about Jobs' early life and the founding of Apple. Production on the film, ""Jobs,"" is scheduled to begin in May while Kutcher is on hiatus from his hit CBS series ""Two and a Half Men,"" reports Variety, the film-industry trade publication. It will be directed by Joshua Michael Stern (""Swing Vote"") and ""will chronicle Steve Jobs from wayward hippie to co-founder of Apple,"" according to Variety. The timing of the story, which was published Sunday on Variety's website, combined with Kutcher's well-known love of pranks, led some to dismiss it as an April Fools' joke. But CNN confirmed Monday through a representative for Kutcher that the actor has signed on for the role. Jeff Sneider, the reporter who wrote the Variety article, said on Twitter on Sunday that the movie will follow Jobs from when he and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 to when Jobs returned to the company in the late 1990s after being forced out. It won't cover Jobs' later years, he said. Jobs, who died in October after a struggle with cancer, dropped out of college and backpacked across India before launching the company that would make him one of the world's most acclaimed entrepreneurs. Kutcher, 34, is one of the more tech-savvy actors in Hollywood. He was an early and enthusiastic user of Twitter, where he has 10 million followers, and has invested in several Silicon Valley startups. Kutcher's movie will face competition from Sony Pictures, which is developing its own Jobs biopic based on the best-selling book by Walter Isaacson. A CNN.com report last fall speculated on which actor might play Jobs in that movie and threw out some names -- James McAvoy, Crispin Glover, Stanley Tucci, Noah Wyle -- but failed to mention Kutcher.","Ashton Kutcher will play tech visionary Steve Jobs in an indie film on his early life .

"(CNN) -- With presents to buy and families to visit, the holiday season can become an endless to-do list. But take some of that vacation time to explore the holiday spirit in action. At these five wonderlands around the country and the world, you'll find the wonder of winter, the wonder of shopping and the wonder of Santa Claus up close. White River National Forest, Minturn, Colorado . This year, the White River National Forest is known for two things. It's the most visited recreational forest in the country, a hub of skiing aficionados, thanks to nearby Aspen and Vail, and it's also the home of the 2012 U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. Since 1970, the Capitol Architect has partnered with a different National Forest to choose a new tree for the Capitol lawn. This year it was White River. ""This was the first time that White River's ever had the privilege of providing it, so it was a big deal for us,"" said Bill Kight, a Forest Service spokesman. The Capitol Tree tours the country during the holiday season before making its way back to Washington -- and it offers visitors a chance to see a piece of the White River National Forest on the move. Those who see the forest itself should expect a different experience than in the warmer months, according to Aurora Palmer, who works in public affairs and sustainable operations at the park. During the winter season, the major attractions include skiing, snowmobiling and sledding, as well as other icy sports. The park even gives out permits for those looking to cut down their own Capitol Tree. ""Fantasy of Lights,"" Callaway Gardens, Pine Mountain, Georgia . Callaway Gardens' ""Fantasy of Lights"" is entering its 21st year. The resort hasn't added a new scene to the massive lights display since 2000. And yet it has lost none of its holiday power. ""It's amazing to see the faces of the people as they come through the gates, and they leave, and they make those Christmas memories,"" said Callaway Gardens spokeswoman Rachel Crumbley. The Georgia resort draws guests year-round. But ""Fantasy of Lights"" -- which includes 8 million lights in 15 seasonal scenes, making it one of the largest displays nationwide -- is special, Crumbley said, drawing both couples and families. ""It's just on such a grand scale,"" Crumbley said. ""And with the music combined with the lights combined with the themes, I think it kind of resonates."" Lake Placid, New York . Lake Placid and the surrounding Adirondack Mountains see the majority of visitors between May and October, but that doesn't mean that the area is lacking when the weather gets colder. Thanks to its proximity to the mountains, Lake Placid offers ""just what the Adirondacks offer,"" said Kim Rielly, spokeswoman at the Lake Placid Convention and Visitors Bureau. That means a variety of outdoor recreation, in a park that stretches across 6 million acres. That's equal to 6 million football fields, she said, although she says that's a conservative estimate. In the last 100 years, Lake Placid has hosted the Winter Olympic Games twice, and it remains a destination for the athletic. Still, Rielly called Lake Placid a ""cool little alpine village in the middle of the wilderness."" At the center of town is an old ski jump, while the surrounding wilderness of the Adirondacks holds multiple museums for exploring and 43 peaks for hiking. One of them, Whiteface Mountain, is paved all the way to the top, so that families can visit the peak by car. And from December 7-9, Lake Placid will host a ""Holiday Village Stroll,"" featuring workshops, holiday story time, a ""Jingle Bell Run"" and more. Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota . The Mall of America remains a destination for any holiday shopper, if only because of its size, featuring more than 500 shops. But this year, the mall is adding to its seasonal appeal with the unveiling of the ""HGTV Holiday House,"" a life-size gingerbread house. Guests can explore the space, which will feature demonstrations, meet-and-greets and regular appearances from HGTV's stable of home dÃ©cor and design personalities. Beyond that, the mall is also hosting a Holiday Music Festival; and its multi-floor shopping selection, complete with an amusement park and larger-than-life Lego installations, dwarfs any other shopping experience as an indoor travel option. Santa Claus Village, Rovaniemi, Finland . Last on the list is a wonderland across the globe, ""the official home of Santa Claus,"" at Rovaniemi in Finland. It's not just a title: one of the town's main attractions is the Santa Claus Village. At the heart of the village is the Santa Claus Chamber, where Santa lives, ready to greet visitors. One of the village's biggest draws is the Santa Claus Main Post Office, said Sanna Kortelainen, managing director for Rovaniemi Tourism & Marketing. ""The Santa Claus Main Post Office is a real post office, which operates 365 days in the year,"" she said. ""That is the place where all the letters to Santa are sent. The letters are opened by post elves and read through."" After that, guests can ride a sleigh or visit the reindeer farm or even explore the Arctic Circle, which begins at the edge of Rovaniemi. The Christmas season is also the best time of year to visit, Kortelainen said. The season begins with a declaration from Santa on November 24 and goes into January, ending when the sun again begins to rise above the horizon.","White River National Forest in Colorado is the most visited forest in the country .

"Washington (CNN) -- Business and labor negotiators working to hammer out a deal on an immigrant guest worker program have reached broad agreement, a source familiar with the talks said Saturday, eliminating one major hurdle to legislation revamping the nation's immigration system. Business leaders and labor groups had been working to develop a plan on guest workers, tackling major sticking points on how much workers would be paid and the number of workers that would be allowed into the country each year. Labor unions influencing the talks, including the AFL-CIO, argued for higher pay and fewer workers per year, since they are concerned about the effect guest workers would have on American workers. Groups such as the Chamber of Commerce have pushed for guest workers to be paid the same as American workers, depending on their training and experience. The source said the agreement would allow for the creation of a new ""W"" visa for lesser-skilled workers not working in agriculture. Those workers would be allowed to enter based on labor market shortages, and would be permitted to come into the United States with the intention of applying for permanent residency. According to the source, the ""W"" visa would affect housekeepers, landscapers, retail workers and some construction workers. The agreement does not address visas for high-skilled workers; visas to bring in family members; or visas for agriculture workers. According to the AFL-CIO's understanding of the agreement, the ""W"" visa program would begin April 1, 2015. The number of visas issued would never go below 20,000 per year and would be capped at 200,000 annually during times of high employment. One third of the visas would be reserved for businesses that employ fewer than 25 people, while no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction workers, the AFL-CIO said. The labor union indicated that in its understanding, the new program would not adversely affect the wages of American citizens, and that companies taking advantage of the ""W"" visas would be required to also recruit U.S. workers. Guest workers would be paid a wage similar to American workers with the same level of experience, according to the AFL-CIO's understanding. A new government department, the Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research, would determine specific industries with labor shortages and make recommendations to Congress. The agency would also play a role in setting an annual cap for ""W"" visas. The AFL-CIO said the bureau would fall under the existing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by Congress. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, one of eight senators who signed onto an immigration reform framework earlier this year, spoke with Thomas Donohue, president and CEO of the Chamber of Commerce, about the new agreement, according to another source familiar with their conversation. The Chamber of Commerce wrote in a statement Saturday that ""the senators will make the decisions about any final agreements and what makes the best public policy overall."" Earlier this week, a source familiar with the congressional negotiations told CNN that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the other thorny issues surrounding comprehensive immigration reform, such as a path to citizenship and metrics for securing the border. Sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak on the record. President Barack Obama has made immigration reform a top priority of his second term in office, and a White House official said Saturday the president ""continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators."" ""We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced, and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible,"" the official said. CNN's Leslie Bentz contributed to this report.","Broad agreement reached on guest worker program, source says .
Sticking points include pay, numbers allowed in U.S.

"(CNN) -- Do you get it? Translation: Are you strategic? How often have you overheard a group talking about a leader and saying, ""She/he just doesn't get it?"" Do they say that about you? A Wall Street Journal survey of corporate human resources and leadership-development executives identified ""strategic thinking"" as the business skill most sought by organizations. So how can you continually hone your strategic-thinking skills in order to provide value to the organization and advance your career? The fact is, most of us are now required to be more successful with fewer resources. Let's focus on the theme that's at the heart of being strategic: differentiation. In order to realize our full potential, we must embrace the style that makes us unique -- whatever it might be. Is our style quiet and introverted, or outgoing and extroverted? Do we thrive in an orderly, structured arena, or one that is constantly changing and requires a great deal of flexibility and improvisation? Success goes to those who are willing to be different in ways that bring value to others. Read more: The army guide to negotiation . Excellence, by its very definition, is deviation from the norm. The norm is an average, or a standard level. It's where the majority of people wind up, even though there is no such thing as a ""normal"" human being. Everyone has a unique style built on differences in background, abilities, temperament, and so forth. The difficult thing is uncovering and living that unique style. A manager whose products and services represent the norm for the industry may break even or make a modest profit. A person who lives by following the herd, and who is not willing to take the risks that will let his or her true gifts shine through, may be comfortable. But neither will ever know the exhilaration of finding what differentiates them and letting authenticity drive their individual success. We are all different from one another; our strategies need to be different as well. Strategy is inherently about doing different things than the competition or doing the same things in different ways than the competition. It's not about being better, it's about being different. Better is often subjective: Is blueberry pie better than lemon meringue? It depends, but it's definitely different and I can sell you on those differences. Differentiation in the studio . British artist Damien Hirst has taken a dramatic approach to art by performing it in a different way. He created a series of artworks in which dead animals (including a shark, a sheep, and a cow) are preserved -- sometimes after having been dissected -- in formaldehyde. While his artwork -- such as ""The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,"" featuring a shark in a tank of formaldehyde -- caused great debate on what is or is not art, one thing can't be denied: his ability to differentiate himself and his work through a well-conceived strategy that has jolted the business world of art. Hirst's different artistic activity has propelled him to become reportedly Britain's richest living artist, with his wealth valued at nearly $350 million. Read more: What's your career superpower? Differentiation in the kitchen . While Hirst employed different activities in the world of art, award-winning chef Grant Achatz has taken the common activity of cooking and is transforming it in different ways. Named the 2008 top chef in the United States by the James Beard Foundation, he is the owner of Alinea, Restaurant Magazine's best restaurant in North America in 2011. Now Achatz has conceived a new concept. His latest restaurant, Next, serves four menus per year, from great moments in culinary history or the future, such as Paris 1912, Sicily 1949, and Hong Kong 2036. Instead of reservations, bookings are made more like those for a play or a sporting event. Tickets are fully inclusive of all charges, including service. Ticket price depends on which seating you buy: Saturday at 8 pm is more expensive than Wednesday at 9:30 pm. Next also offers an annual subscription to all four menus at a discount, with preferred seating. Achatz has taken the common activity of running a restaurant and is constantly finding new ways to do it differently. Discover your differentiation . Five questions to help you discover your differentiation this year: . 1. What are the activities I perform that are truly different from those others perform? 2. What are the similar activities I perform in different ways than others do? 3. What characteristics or traits do I have that are unique to me? 4. What resources do I have that are different from those of others? 5. What is the primary differentiated value I bring to people in my life? Most books and training programs only address the first three levels of strategy: corporate, business unit and functional group. In reality, these are all subsets of the most important level of strategy: you.

"(CNN) -- His shooting spree left at least 10 dead and millions terrified of bullets coming from an unseen sniper. But Mildred Muhammad believes she was the ultimate target of her ex-husband, John Allan Muhammad, the man dubbed the ""D.C. Sniper."" And for some time, Muhammad said she felt extreme guilt for the victims that were gunned down in grocery store parking lots and gas stations. The youngest was a 13-year-old boy who was shot while walking to his Maryland school. Muhammad spoke about the guilt she felt after the killing spree on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night, the day before her ex-husband was scheduled to be executed. Muhammad said she has gradually gotten over her guilty feelings and focused on her three children. ""I felt that way initially because I had done everything I knew how to do to bring attention to how dangerous he was to me,"" Muhammad said. ""I had no idea his anger would extend beyond me, to include all people in his killings."" John Muhammad, the mastermind behind the Washington-area sniper attacks of 2002, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday evening at a state prison near Jarratt, Virginia. During two lengthy trials -- including one featuring testimony from young accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo -- and in several years of legal appeals, John Muhammad has continued to profess his innocence. Prosecutors say John Muhammad intended the killings to provide a smokescreen to cover up his real goal -- killing his ex-wife Mildred and gaining custody of his three children. Muhammad said she divorced John Muhammad because of abuse and has not visited him since he was in prison. ""I feel that all of my efforts, all of my energy is to help my children through this emotional turmoil that they are going through,"" said Muhammad. ""I don't have an emotional attachment to John."" John Muhammad's other ex-wife, Carol Williams, also talked to King Monday. Williams, John Muhammad's first wife, said she plans to visit him in prison with their son Tuesday before the execution. Williams also brought letters that John Muhammad wrote her from prison. ""Carol, I have missed my family for the past eight years. I don't want to be missed the day that these devils murder my innocent black (expletive),"" John Muhammad wrote in one of the letters. Williams said she was not surprised that John Muhammad still believed he was innocent. ""I'm praying for myself, for my son, and also for the families of the victims,"" Williams said.","John Muhammad's second ex-wife, Mildred, believes she was ultimate target of sniper spree .

"(CNN) -- It's become as much an integral part of the annual golfing calendar as any tournament. Every year in the week of the Players tournament at TPC Sawgrass, a select few are inducted to World Golf's Hall of Fame (WGHOF). But the 2013 ceremony on May 6 is not without a degree of controversy -- thanks to the caustic observations of one of the Hall of Fame's very own. Members are elected in five different categories -- principally the PGA Tour ballot and the International ballot -- for players who compete outside the U.S. circuit. The criteria for getting on the ballot takes into account how many tournaments you have won -- with extra credit given for the four majors and the Players tournament, which is often dubbed the 'fifth major."" But in the view of American golfer Ray Floyd -- a four time major winner elected to the Hall of Fame in the 1980s -- it has become a club that is too easy to join. Angry Floyd . In an interview with Golf Magazine the straight talking former Ryder Cup captain let rip: . ""The bar has been lowered. Guys get voted into the Hall of Fame who don't belong, who lack the numbers. I'm very upset at the Hall of Fame for that. It's not fair to the people who went in early."" ""Just look at the inductees over the last six, eight, 10 years,"" Floyd added. ""Some years, I don't even vote because the names are not worthy of induction. One major should not get you into the Hall of Fame -- maybe one major and 40 wins."" ""I'll just say that you should have at least two majors. At least,"" he explained. ""Wow, there are guys in there that it's a joke. It takes integrity away from the term Hall of Fame,"" he added. Floyd did not name names -- but few doubted he was targeting two of this year's intake -- Fred Couples and Colin Montgomerie. Couples only won one major - the U.S. Masters in 1992. Montgomerie famously won none, coming second five times. A giant on the European tour and in the Ryder Cup, the Scot never managed to grab one of the prizes all his peers strive for. Stout defense . The WGHOF chief operating officer, Jack Peter, told CNN's Living Golf that he welcomed an honest exchange of views of the merits or otherwise of inductees. ""We love the debate,"" he said with a smile. ""It's an election that we administer and it's a bit of a ' let the chips fall where they may' in terms of who gets elected."" But he's quick to firmly defend this year's choices, including the major-less Monty: . ""What Colin's body of work has done for the European tour, for the game in Europe, his contribution to the Ryder Cup -- it's extraordinary. ""And I don't think because he has not won majors precludes him from the Hall of Fame. We want to celebrate the game. We want to recognize greatness."" It's possible the controversy could build in years to come. There are several star players -- Lee Westwood, Luke Donald and Sergio Garcia -- who still can't win one of the four majors. Lively debate . And yet some other major winners in recent years -- Webb Simpson, Keegan Bradley, Ben Curtis -- have won only a handful of other tournaments. But if debate stirs interest, Peter is happy. ""We administer the ballot. Should it be more strict -- maybe; should it be less strict -- maybe. There's a number of scenarios here that you could put together to do this, but were pretty comfortable with where we are. ""It is about fame, it's a vote, and he got the votes. Should he have more wins, less wins, I leave that to you guys in the media"" Montgomerie and Couples are joined in the Hall of Fame this year by former U.S. Open champion and broadcaster Ken Venturi; Ken Schofield, the previous head of the European Tour, as well as the course designer Willie Park Jr, a British Open champion from the 19th century. Who knows what he would have made of it all.","Golf picks its Hall of Fame inductees annually .

"Washington (CNN) -- Phone records obtained by the government through a secret surveillance program disclosed last week helped to prevent ""dozens"" of terrorist acts, the director of the National Security Agency told a Senate hearing on Wednesday. Army Gen. Keith Alexander provided the most detailed account so far from a government official of the program in which the agency collects phone records that then can be accessed under federal court permission to investigate suspected terrorists. The scope of the secret program -- potentially involving phone records of every American -- set off a political firestorm when details emerged with publication of a leaked document. Further leaks revealed other secret programs that collect computer activity and other information. Critics on the right and left accused the government of going well beyond the intended reach of the Patriot Act enacted after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. Questioned by senators from both parties at a hearing on broader cybersecurity issues, Alexander provided a spirited defense for the programs he described as critical to counter-terrorism efforts. ""I think what we're doing to protect American citizens here is the right thing,"" he said. ""Our agency takes great pride in protecting this nation and our civil liberties and privacy, and doing it in partnership with this committee, with this Congress, and with the courts."" Alexander added that he welcomed a public debate over protecting America while preserving civil liberties. ""To date, we've not been able to explain it because it's classified, so that issue is something that we're wrestling with,"" he said. ""... This isn't something that's just NSA or the administration doing that and so on. This is what ... our nation expects our government to do for us. So, we ought to have that debate. We ought to put it out there."" In the end, he said, some aspects of the giant surveillance apparatus created after 9/11 would have to remain classified. ""And they should be, because if we tell the terrorists every way that we are going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said. Alexander also rejected the claim that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who admitted leaking the top-secret documents on electronic surveillance programs and is now in hiding, could tap into any American's phone or e-mail. ""I know of no way to do that,"" he said, calling Snowden's statement ""false."" In an exchange with Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Alexander said he believed the program under Section 215 of the Patriot Act was ""critical"" in helping the intelligence community corroborate information on possible threats. ""It is dozens of terrorist events that these have helped prevent,"" Alexander said of the Section 215 program and another that collects information on foreign computer use. He would not discuss specific disrupted plots, saying they were classified, but he told Leahy that the two programs together played a role in helping to stop a planned attack on the New York subway system. Information developed overseas was passed along to the FBI, which was able to identify suspect Najibullah Zazi in Colorado and ultimately uncover a plot, he said. Zazi pleaded guilty to terror-related charges in 2010. In response to questions from senators about why the Section 215 program needed to collect billions of U.S. phone records, Alexander explained that the agency held the records for five years in the event that an investigation uncovered an overseas terrorist link to a specific area in the United States. With a database of phone records, the agency can go ""back in time"" to figure out the number and date that a suspect called, he said. ""We won't search that unless we have some reasonable, articulable suspicion about a terrorist-related organization,"" Alexander said. Once permission is granted, ""we can now look and say, 'who was this guy talking to in the United States and why?'"" Opinion: Why NSA spying scares the world . ""The system just gives us back who he was talking to,"" Alexander explained. ""But if you didn't collect it, how do you know who he was talking to?"" Obtaining further information, such as the content of the call, would require a court order, he said. GOP Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska pressed Alexander on the issue, asking if the search could span ""the breadth of telephone records."" ""The American public is fearful that in this massive amount of data you get that there's the ability of the federal government to synthesize that data and learn something more than maybe what was ever contemplated by the Patriot Act,"" Johanns said. NSA hacks China, leaker claims . Alexander will return to the panel on Thursday to give a classified briefing on the programs in order to provide more information, and he pledged to work with the committee to come up with more detailed explanations for the American public. He explained his caution on Wednesday by saying revelations such as the classified documents about the secret programs were harmful to national security efforts. ""I would rather take a public beating and people think I am hiding something than to jeopardize the security of this country,"" Alexander said.

"Washington (CNN) -- An increase in the number of brazen laser attacks on planes in the United States has reached an ""epidemic level."" According to an FBI blog post, the number of incidents is projected to reach 3,700 by the end of the year, compared to just 283 in 2005, a rise of more than 1,100%. Last year, there were 3,592 reported laser incidents, the FAA said. The FBI cited the Internet as a source for cheap, easy to purchase hand-held gadgets about the size of fountain pens which have become more powerful in recent years. Lasers costing as little as a dollar can have ranges of 2 miles, the FBI said. Incidents on the rise, harsh penalties sought . The number of attacks is reaching an ""epidemic level,"" said George Johnson, a supervisory federal air marshal who is a liaison officer with the FBI. Lasers directed at aircraft can cause temporary blindness to pilots for a few seconds, posing risks during takeoffs and landings. ""Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft is dangerous and reckless. Just don't do it,"" Johnson said. Those who intentionally aim a laser at an aircraft can be prosecuted under two federal statutes, including a law put into effect this year that makes it punishable by up to five years in prison and $11,000 per violation without the benefit of a warning notice or counseling. An existing law allows punishment up to 20 years in prison and fines of $250,000. Russian airliners targeted by 'laser hooligans' Michael Huerta, acting FAA administrator, is on record as saying his department will ""aggressively"" prosecute violators. Laser incident reports have increased steadily since the FAA created a formal reporting system in 2005 to collect information from pilots. In 2011, the FBI said those responsible for ""lasering"" aircraft fall into two general profiles, either minors with no criminal history or older men with criminal records. Human traffickers or drug runners have also sought ""to thwart airborne surveillance,"" according to the FBI.","Number of incidents is projected to reach 3,700 by the end of the year, FBI says .

"(CNN) -- A teenager charged with the fatal beating last week of a Chicago man had a video of the attack on his cell phone when arrested Saturday, a video he also posted on his Facebook page, prosecutors said Monday. Malik Jones, 16, allegedly was playing a game called ""pick 'em out and knock 'em out"" when he punched Delfino Mora, 62, in his jaw, sending Mora to the ground, where the back of his head was cracked by concrete, a Cook County, Illinois, prosecutor told a judge during a hearing Monday. Nicholas Ayala, 17, and Anthony Malcolm, 18, used Jones' cell phone camera to record the attack, picking up the ""loud crack of his head hitting the cement,"" prosecutor's spokeswoman Tandra Simonton said. Four arrested after Indian woman's assault captured on video . All three teens were ordered held without bail until their next court date August 3, Simonton said. All three were being charged as adults with first-degree murder, prosecutors said. Mora, the father of 12, was collecting aluminum cans and scrap metal to sell in an alley near his north Chicago home when Jones chose him as his victim, she said. ""I think I'm going to knock this guy out,"" Jones is heard saying on the video. All three teens left the alley laughing, leaving the bleeding Mora on the ground, Simonton said. Jones and Ayala returned a few minutes later to take $60 from his wallet, she said. A 64-year-old man was allegedly robbed by the teens of $1 a few minutes later, prosecutors said. Mora died in St. Francis Hospital the next day from cranial-cerebral injury, blunt head trauma and asthma, according to the Cook County medical examiner. Connecticut woman arrested in group home assault caught on video . Jones posted the beating video on his Facebook page, and it was seen there by someone who said Jones also attacked him on June 30, Simonton said. That man showed it to Mora's youngest son, Emmanuel, who is a friend of his, and that led police to Jones on Saturday, she said. ""I want revenge, but my mom told us not to do anything,"" Emmanuel Mora, 20, told CNN affiliate WGN. ""God would take care of him and he's going to pay twice."" His older brother, Valentin Mora, told CNN Monday that Emmanuel is too traumatized by seeing the beating video to talk about it. Mora often walked the streets of his neighborhood, his son said. ""He don't like to stay home,"" Valentin Mora said. ""He wants to bring in extra money. Social Security is not enough."" The family is trying to raise money to pay for the return of Mora's body to his hometown in Mexico for burial. An account for donations was created at Chase Bank in Chicago, his son said.

"(CNN) -- My mother often tells the story of my first birthday party, which took about as long to plan as the gathering lasted. It included a homemade sheet cake. As my parents were ready to sing ""Happy Birthday,"" my mother went outside and invited all of the neighborhood kids who were within listening distance as she called out the invitation. When Bill Doherty, a family therapist and professor at University of Minnesota, was researching overscheduled kids about 10 years ago, parents complained that ""birthday parties are becoming out of hand."" Talk to parents of school-age children, and they'll tell you about the pressure and expense of the birthday circuit. Besides soccer, dance and violin lessons, children also have invitations to birthday parties several weekends out of the year. Doherty said that examples of extravagant parties were easy to find. In one Minnesota town, the parents of the birthday girl rented a bar for a princess-themed party. Guests were picked up in limos. The parents wore tuxedos and formal gowns. There was live music and champagne for adults. And the birthday girl was turning 4. When talking with parents, Doherty said, it is clear how sensitive an issue this is. ""Birthday parties are embedded in local culture. There is pressure to meet those norms. It is embedded in human nature and not wanting to disappoint the child."" According to Doherty, parents don't want to send the message that their kid isn't as important as other children, so they feel pressure to go all-out to provide the experience of a lifetime -- every year. But, he says, it doesn't have to be this way. He and a team created alternatives based on parents' real experiences; the goal was to offer options that actual parents find successful . Doherty suggests starting with what your values are. ""Don't start with what everyone else is doing. Give yourself permission to have low-key parties."" According to Doherty, the average child celebrates his birthday with three or four events each year, including parties with nuclear family, extended family, friends and neighbors, and school. ""Eliminating one of them wouldn't be the end of the world."" Another suggestion: nix the goody bags. ""So often, you come home with a gift bag, and it is full of plastic little things that are going to end up all over your house. Junk that you don't want, they don't need and they've lost by the next day,"" said Kathy Williams, a mother of three in Annapolis, Maryland. ""Talk to parents in the party circuit to negotiate a mutual disarmament,"" Doherty suggested. When it comes to the party favors, ""most parents don't like them. They are an extra expense, and you throw the junk out anyway."" The challenge is being the family to go first. ""Parents don't want to disappoint or cause bad feelings."" One of the biggest challenges Williams faces when planning parties for her children, Cora, Megan and Rex, is how to limit the guest list. ""I want to have it intimate enough where my children can spend time with their closest friends, but it is so hard because at school the kids are talking about their birthday parties and somebody is going to get left out, and then there is hard feelings. It is difficult. I don't know what the magic number is or where to draw the line."" ""Lead with your values on these decisions, not with money,"" Doherty said. Even with families who have more resources they can dedicate to a party, there can be unintended consequences for throwing a big birthday bash. ""The risk is sending a message to your child that they are more special than anyone else."" When Williams plans her parties, she has one ultimate goal: ""I hope my kids enjoy their time with friends and family. That's the most important thing."" 5 tips to reduce stress around birthday gifts . 1. Ask grandparents and family members to give no more than one gift. If they feel they need to give more, ask them to donate $10 to the birthday child's college savings account. 2. Ask for no gifts and suggest that invitees bring a canned food item to give to the local food pantry. 3. Ask invitees to bring their favorite new or used book to donate to a local library or shelter, or have all the invitees exchange books at the party. 4. Have the birthday child write thank-you notes before playing with any of the newly received gifts. 5. Make a fancy homemade certificate giving the birthday child the gift of a special outing with a parent, such as to a museum, science center, sledding, beach day, camping, etc. List adapted from ""Birthdays Without Pressure,"" University of Minnesota.

"(CNN) -- You might remember the ad campaign ""Bo knows baseball. Bo knows football."" But these days sports legend Bo Jackson knows charity. Jackson has dedicated his post-pro-sports days to raising money to help restore the areas of his native Alabama devastated by a tornado in April 2011. He is also raising awareness on how to protect yourself and others from deadly storms. Jackson recalls that day: ""I was in Illinois, where I live, and I can't remember what I was doing but I got phone calls from relatives and friends saying there's a bad storm -- a big tornado."" Big indeed. A mile-wide tornado demolished much of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and the surrounding areas on April 27, 2011. This killer tornado was a part of a bigger storm system that left more than 300 people dead in the Southeast. Jackson remembers a conversation he had with his sister in the aftermath. ""She said the storm was bad but everybody in our little town was OK. But other towns like Tuscaloosa, Cordova, Coleman, Jasper -- they got hit pretty hard,"" Jackson says. Rocked by the news, Jackson, a native of Bessemer, Alabama, who starred in football and baseball at Auburn University, knew he couldn't just sit idly by as the community that supported him in his climb to success was now in ruins. ""I sat up and thought about what I can do to give back to my community, my state. And I came up with this harebrained idea to ride a bicycle across the state,"" Jackson says. His idea became reality with the creation of Bo Bikes Bama. Jackson and his friends rode across the state to raise money not only to help rebuild but also to build community storm shelters. ""Bo Bikes Bama is an event where I want to make the rest of the country aware of just how severe a tornado can be. It's a way of coming back home and doing something for the people that had faith in me when I was younger. Bo Bikes Bama is all about caring about your brothers and sisters,"" Jackson says. The first Bo Bikes Bama took place in 2012 and Jackson has vowed to make it an annual event because he feels the need will always be there. The storms will keep coming and the mission for him is not just to rebuild after loss, but to better prepare for the next storm. ""I decided to make it an annual event, as long as I can ride to raise money for tornado victims."" He also is aware that in addition to the money raised, the event is a morale booster for the survivors in these small towns. ""People will be struggling to rebuild for a long time. And just to see these people come out and stand beside the street and wave and smile after everything that they've been through -- lost family members, lost their homes, their jobs -- and they still come out (and) thank you for what you're doing. ... It's a period where everybody has decided to come together and work as one for one great cause,"" Jackson says. In addition to the bike ride, Jackson and his group go into small Alabama towns seeking to persuade landowners to donate land where community storm shelters can be built. ""When you don't have a place to get out of the way of a tornado, a lot of people get injured, lose their lives. Hiding in a closet or getting in a bathtub doesn't work when the whole house is getting picked up off the foundation and getting thrown down the street,"" Jackson says. And while the bike ride is Jackson's major annual fundraiser, he stresses that the need continues year round and his group collects donations year round to continue their efforts. ""I would rather do something to prevent the loss of life now than wait until something else bad happens,"" Jackson says. He also sees that severe weather like this affects many more Americans beyond Alabama and he recognizes the need to expand his reach. ""I have already been contacted by friends of mine to come and do the same thing in Mississippi. I've been contacted by friends of mine in Missouri (Jackson played baseball for the Kansas City Royals) that would love for me to come back there and do something there, and I want to. I will. But I gotta take care of home first.""","Bo Jackson was very disturbed about tornadoes that hit Alabama, his home state .

"(CNN) -- It has been a rocky couple of years for the people of Egypt. Since the 2011 revolution, the economy has tanked, street protests are an almost daily occurrence and the political situation remains volatile. However, a handful of young Egyptians have found that the best way to take a stand against the turmoil is with stand-up comedy. ""We are like a little beam of sunlight, coming through and reminding people, 'Don't worry! When this cloud passes, it will be brighter. It will be happier,'"" says Rami Borai, a comedian in one of Egypt's first home-grown comedy troupes, Hezb El Comedy. The group, whose name means ""The Comedy Party,"" was formed in 2009 by Hashim Al Gahry, who admits he started up with ""zero capital."" Al Gahry and some friends pooled their savings, and started marketing the group through social media. When they're not performing, Hezb El Comedy teaches the art of stand-up to other aspiring comics, instructing them on things like timing and body language. ""We're not the funniest people in the world, but it's the experience that has put us in a position to give them advice and tell them, 'These are our mistakes, and this is what you can do to avoid what we did,'"" says Al Gahry. Read more: Book shows collection of Iran's political cartoons . Other Arab nations are similarly investing in grassroots comedy. In Qatar, a few young comics have come together to form SUCQ (an acronym for Stand Up Comedy Qatar). ""It's an American art. We took it from the Americans. We have reshaped it to adapt to our culture and society and people,"" says Hamad Al Amri, 24, a comedian who is also a banker by day. Mohamed Kamal, who also performs stand-up with SUCQ, notes that given Qatar's political climate, there are limits to what he can joke about. ""We can't talk about politics, or very sensitive topics, like sex or religion,"" he notes. For those comics in the Middle East who don't censor themselves, comedy can be a risky business. Earlier this month, Egyptian satirist Bassem Youssef made headlines after he was charged for mocking both Islam and Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsy. Other comics in the region have faced similar fates. Sami Fehri, a Tunisian producer of a political puppet show, was imprisoned for corruption charges, and Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was jailed last year for mocking religious figures. Read more: Syria's ""freedom graffiti"" amid devastation of war goes viral . Al Gahry admits that as a comic, he must proceed with caution. ""You have to push the limit, but you have to be very careful,"" he says. Borai, meanwhile, finds humour in the prospect of facing arrest. ""If I ever read a newspaper that said, 'Ramy was indicted,' I would say, 'Yo, mom, this is it!' I'll fly out of here, but I would be like, 'I got kicked out of my country for being too damn funny!'""","A handful of young Egyptians find relief from the country's turmoil in stand-up comedy .
