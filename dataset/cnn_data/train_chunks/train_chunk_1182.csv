"A mysterious case of nine experienced skiers who died in bizarre circumstances on an expedition into Siberia may have been solved by an America researcher. Donnie . Eichar, a film-maker and author, spent four years investigating the so-called Dyatlov Pass incident, and has now claimed that . he has discovered a 'scientific' explanation for the baffling case. The skiers, who were all students, were led into the wilderness of the Ural mountains by 23-year-old Igor Dyatlov. Scroll down for video . Smiling before disaster: (Left to right) Nicolai Thibeaux-Brignolle, Luda Dubinina, Semyon . Zolotarev and Zina Kolmogorova . Their aim was to reach the remote Otorten . Mountain, but - with the exception of one man who turned back early due . to ill health - the entire party would be found dead beneath the snow. Rescuers sent out into the -24-degree weather to track the party down at first found only a collapsed tent, still filled with all the clothing and survival gear needed to make the rest of the journey. But the empty tent baffled investigators, as it still contained items of clothing and pairs of shoes - implying that some of the students had ventured out into the wilderness barefoot and without coats. Even when later searches uncovered the frozen bodies of all nine victims, no convincing explanation could be found for why the experienced hikers - who would have been well-versed in winter survival techniques - had come to such a tragic end. Search parties found one group of . bodies lying in the snow on flat land near a river, a mile from the . tent, next to the remains of a long burnt-out fire. Around . 350 yards away lay the corpse of Dyatlov, the engineering student from Ural Polyetchnic who had put the expedition . together and was its leader. His name would later be given to the area . where the tragedy took place, as well as the incident itself. Nearby, . a search dog sniffed out the remains of Zina Kolmogorova, 22, under . four inches of snow, and then that of Rustem Slobodin. The bodies were . in a line 200 yards apart, as if they had been trying to crawl behind . each other back up to the shelter of the tent, but never made it. Eerie: The tent as the rescuers found it on February 26, 1959, which had been cut open from inside . Another . two months went by before the rest of the group were found, under 15ft . of snow in a den they had desperately hollowed out for themselves before . succumbing to the cold. Some . of this group had broken bones and terrible internal injuries but, . strangely, no external wounds, not even scratches on the skin. Post-mortem . examinations of all nine bodies threw their own anomalies, as some . bodies were fully clothed, others almost naked. One, belonging to . Lyudmilla Dubinina was missing her tongue and eyes. An investigation by a Soviet government inspector was also fruitless, and was quietly dropped after concluding nobody was to blame. Lev Ivanov, the inspector, concluded only that all nine deaths had been caused by what he described as ‘an unknown elemental force which they were unable to overcome’. Striking camp: The skiers setting up camp on February 2, 1959 in a photo taken from a roll of film found by investigators . Experienced skiers: Yuri Yudin, centre, hugging Lyudmila Dubinina as he prepares to leave the group due to illness, which saved his life as he left the expedition before the deaths . But in a recent interview with Failure magazine, Mr Eichar hinted at his conclusion, saying: 'The conclusion that I have come up with could only have happened with the help of modern science and the help of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.' Jason Zasky, who interviewed Mr Eichar, . also wrote that his theory: 'involves a particular . type of repetitive wind event (one that could be produced by the . topography of Dead Mountain), which in turn might have triggered . panic-inducing infrasound.' Mr Eichar has stayed tight-lipped . about the specifics, but said the original investigator: 'couldn’t explain what . happened because he lacked the science and technology to do so.' The 'infrasound' theory to which the interviewer refers is a bizarre - but apparently plausible - explanation which argues that sound waves too low to hear could have subtly affected the minds of the skiers, panicking them and causing them to rush recklessly out into the snow, where the cold killed them. These waves of infrasound, it seems, could have been produced by high winds resonating thanks to the shape of the mountains. Studied have suggested that infrasound - soundwaves too low for humans to hear - can nonetheless produce feelings of unease, awe or even terror which cannot be explained any other way. It is unclear how far this explanation matches Mr Eichar's - but supporters of the theory claim it can account for the bizarre situation in which the bodies were found.","Donnie Eichar said discovered the secret in an interview about his new book .

"WhatsApp is set to add the ability to send and receive voice messages through its app for the first time.. The firm, bought last week by Facebook, will launch the service within weeks in a bid to take on phone firms. CEO Jan Koum said the voice service will be deployed for Android and iPhones this spring, with Blackberry and Microsoft and Nokia phones coming later. Scroll down for video . WhatsApp Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Jan Koum at the Mobile World Congress  in Barcelona. The app will add voice calls to its product in the second quarter of this year. Over 450 million people using the service each month . Firm has 50 employees . 70% of those people active on a given day; . Messaging volume approaching the entire global telecom SMS volume . Service adds more than 1 million new registered users per day . 600m photos uploaded each day . 200m voice messages sent each day . 'We are going to introduce voice in WhatsApp in the second quarter of this year,' Koum said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. 'I think we have the best voice product out there. 'We use the least amount of bandwidth.' WhatsApp currently has a voice function but only in note form. This new service will be live. On Wednesday, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in a deal that is by far the biggest by the social networking company and any other done by Google, Microsoft or Apple. Wearing a gray shirt, jeans and a black jacket, the 38-year-old Koum quipped - 'last week we added a new Facebook friend. 'I don't know if you guys heard.' However, the firm was hit by technical problems days later as 'server issues' caused a crash on Saturday. The popular application's chat conversations - used by more than 450 million people across the world each month - showed a loading asterisk and alert, 'Connecting...' while the problems persisted. The blockbuster deal made serious waves with those in the telecommunications industry who gathered this week in the Catalan city, but also sparked concern among users that Facebook would introduce advertising to WhatsApp. Koum insisted that there are no designs to add 'marketing' to the messaging service. 'There are no planned changes,' said Koum. 'Our vision and mission are aligned. We both want to make the world more connected.' Facebook is paying $12 billion in stock and $4 billion in cash for WhatsApp. Koum along with fellow founder Brian Acton and their 55 employees were also granted restricted stock worth $3 billion that will vest over four years after the deal closes. Boom: The free instant messaging service created in 2009 has grown faster than Facebook in its five years, and now has more than 450million monthly users around the world . Koum said that he didn't expect that WhatsApp's staff would grow in number very much, saying that 'we want to operate as a startup.' Relatively unknown until now in the U.S., WhatsApp is popular in other countries, both in Europe and in emerging economies. The Mountain View, California, startup already has almost twice as many users as the better known short messaging service, Twitter. WhatsApp has 465 million monthly users and 330 daily users, according to Koum, and costs users $1 a year after a first free year. The world's biggest social networking company said last week that it is paying $12 billion in Facebook stock and $4 billion in cash for WhatsApp. In addition, the app's founders and employees will be granted $3 billion in restricted stock that will vest over four years after the deal closes. Facebook says it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 million. 'The acquisition supports Facebook and WhatsApp's shared mission to bring more connectivity and utility to the world by delivering core internet services efficiently and affordably,' the social network said. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2014. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users. 'The combination of WhatsApp and Facebook will allow us to connect many more people round the world,' Zuckerberg said. Boost: WhatsApp is still growing and is predicted to have a billion users soon . 'We want to develop more mobile experiences like Instagram and Messenger. 'WhatApp fits this vision perfectly, it has incredibly strong engagement and growth.' 'It's the only app we've ever seen that has grown more quickly than Facebook itself.' 'Their product roadmap is very exciting and won't change. 'Overall, I'm very excited about this deal. 'WhatsApp had every option in the world, so I'm thrilled they chose us.' As part of the deal, WhatsApp co-founder and Chief Executive Jan Koum will join Facebook's board, and the social network will grant an additional $3 billion worth of restricted stock units to WhatsApp's founders, including Koum. The sale of WhatsApp to Facebook for $19 billion has made its founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires overnight. But they are not your typical Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Success came to them late. The pair were well over 30 when they launched their messaging app in 2009. The duo stand out in Silicon Valley for their unusual approach. They both hate advertising and have paid for almost no marketing to make the five-year-old app a success. This may be because 37-year-old Koum and 42-year-old Acton had unusual backgrounds. Koum was born and raised in a small village outside of Kiev, Ukraine. Growing up, his home had no electricity or hot water. His parents, a housewife and a construction manager, avoided talking on the phone in case it was tapped by the state. Koum and his mother immigrated to Mountain View when he was 16. By 18, Koum had taught himself computer networking by buying manuals from a used book store and returning them when he’d finished. In 1997, Koum took a job at Yahoo sitting across a desk from Acton. They hit it off, because they enjoyed each others straight-down-the-line style. Michigan-born Acton studied engineering at the University of Central Florida and graduated in 1988. In May, 1992 he got a job at Rockwell International as systems administrator. Acton became Yahoo employee 44 in 1996, worked as software engineer, then senior software engineer, principal software engineer and director of engineering. The pair stayed with Yahoo for over a decade building their bond through games of ultimate frisbee.  In September 2007 Koum and Acton finally left Yahoo. They both applied to Facebook and were rejected. Instead they decided to set up their own venture, Whatsapp, now sold to Facebook for billions. According to reports, the success of Whatsapp hasn’t changed Koum or Acton. When a journalist visited the company's headquarters in July 2012, the Koum was barefoot and Acton was sporting flip-flops. 'This is an incredible moment for me,' Mr Koum said. 'Every day over 19bn messages are sent, with over 1m new users every day. 'We wanted it to be simple, and a better service than SMS.' 'We're excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue to bring our product to more people around the world,' 'WhatsApp's extremely high user engagement and rapid growth are driven by the simple, powerful and instantaneous messaging capabilities we provide.' The deal instantly makes WhatsApp cofounders Jan Koum and Brian Acton billionaires. Forbes estimates that Koum held about a 45% stake in the company, while Acton’s stake was over 20%. Proud moment: Jan Koum, pictured at a digital conference in January, described the deal as 'incredible' Facebook promised to keep the WhatsApp brand and service, and pledged a $1 billion cash break-up fee were the deal to fall through. WhatsApp will remain based in Mountain View, Calif., and Facebook said its own messenger app and WhatsApp's core messaging product will continue to operate as separate applications . Shares in Facebook slid 5 percent to $64.70 after hours, from a close of $68.06 on the Nasdaq. Facebook was advised by Allen & Co, while WhatApp has enlisted Morgan Stanley for the deal. The deal is the latest aquisition for Facebook, which last year bought Instagram. It also reportedly offered to pay close to $3 billion or more to acquire messaging service Snapchat, though that offer was spurned by the site's founders. WhatsApp in numbers . Zuckerberg said WhatsApp would operate in the same way as Instagram, as a separate firm. 'It would be pretty stupid of us to interfere,' he said. He also said he was not planning to put ads on the service. 'Our strategy is to grow and connect people. 'Once we get to 2-3 billion people there are ways we can monetise. 'Now we want to focus on growing users. I don't think ads are the right way here.' Koum also pledged not to add ads to WhatsApp, which makes money from a subscription model. 'We think advertising is not the way to go - we create a direct relationship with customers,' said Koum. 'We want to make the product better, faster and more efficient.' Experts say the deal could help Facebook attract teens. Professor Will Stewart from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) said: 'Obviously WhatsApp adds instant messaging to Facebook which must strengthen their position for the moment. 'Equally, all app types rise and fade, so established social media formats like Facebook will be overtaken by something new, and picking up candidates that might have ultimately replaced them may be a good survival strategy for a while. 'This does show the growing significance of mobile, though of course Facebook is on mobile anyway. 'But, Facebook has been around a while now so the real question is what comes next?'","Comes says after Facebook agreed to buy firm for $19bn .

"A Malaysia Airlines plane was forced to abort a take-off after learning that it was on a collision course with an incoming airliner. Flight MH136, which had 167 passengers on board, was already rolling down the runway at Adelaide Airport yesterday when it was forced to slam on the brakes. Adelaide Air Traffic Control radioed the flight, bound for Kuala Lumpur, with instructions to abort the takeoff after realising the plane was on a collision course with in incoming jet. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH136 was forced to abort a take-off after learning that it was on a collision course with an incoming jet (file picture) The near-miss happened at Adelaide Airport yesterday as the plane was rolling down the runway with 167 passengers on board . According to Malaysia's New Straits Times, an official said: 'MH136 stopped its takeoff safely and waited the required cool-down time on its brakes before departing from Adelaide.' The Aviation Herald reported 'that a Tiger Airways Airbus A320 on approach had been too high and too fast on approach'. Air traffic control reportedly wanted to make sure the Malaysia Airlines A330 'didn't climb underneath' it. The news comes just two weeks after another Malaysian Airlines plane, flight MH17, was shot down in a suspected attack by Russian separatist while flying over Ukraine. All 298 people on board, including 80 children, died after the plane was allegedly hit by a BUK surface-to-air missile fired by rebels demanding independence from Ukraine. On that occasion Malaysia airlines drew criticism for flying over a war-zone, but it was later established that the plane was flying along an agreed flight path through unrestricted airspace. It is believed that separatist fighters accidentally fired on the civilian aircraft, thinking it was military. And in March this year a third Malaysia Airlines flight, MH370, attracted worldwide media attention after it went missing while traveling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. According to Malaysia's New Straits Times, an official said: 'MH136 stopped its takeoff safely and waited the required cool-down time on its brakes before departing from Adelaide' Two weeks ago 298 people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 died after the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile above Ukraine, and in March Flight MH370 disappeared along with 298 passengers and crew . The flight deviated from its intended flight path, making a U-turn and heading out towards the Bay of Bengal, before it dropped off of military radar. To date, no trace of the plane or the 239 passengers and crew on board has ever been found. Theories about the disappearance include a cockpit fire, the smoke from which could have knocked the pilots unconscious, leaving the plane to drift until it ran out of fuel and dropped into the ocean. Several investigations have also focused on one of the pilots, Zaharie Shah, who owned a home flight simulator and had plotted a route into the southern Indian Ocean in the days before the plane disappeared. Searches are still ongoing in the Indian Ocean for the wreckage, and while hopes have been raised several times by electrical 'ping' signals coming from the ocean floor, so far nothing has been found.","Flight MH136 was rolling down the runway when it was told to abort take-off .

"Middle-class  cheat: Caroline Foxley, 59, claimed over £20,000 in benefits despite having £200,000 in a Swiss bank and says she can not touch the money because the Mafia would come after her . A middle-class benefits cheat who claimed over £20,000 in benefits despite having £200,000 in a Swiss bank has said she can not touch the money because the Mafia would come after her. Caroline Foxley, 59, was convicted last month of claiming job seekers allowance, housing benefits and income support while her two children went to private schools. But despite having £200,000 deposited in Switzerland, Foxley claimed today that her dead ex-boyfriend had been mixed up with Italian criminals who controlled this money and she did not see it as her own. The mother of two’s assertion that the Mafia would try to kill her if she tried to get the money back came as she was due to be sentenced today. However, a judge was asked to adjourn the case and told Foxley had failed to help probation workers compile a pre-sentence report because of her ‘chaotic’ lifestyle. David Leathley, defending, described Foxley as ‘infuriating’ and told the court: 'She is an enigma, but more of an enigma is Dr Kurt Meyer, the late doctor who got himself arrested in Italy. 'She believes Dr Kurt Mayer was, inter alia, in trouble with the Mafia and/or the Mob and they have control of the money and she was too frightened to present that scenario at her trial. 'She tells me that if she tries to recover the money she is dead. She is adamant that she cannot touch the money because it is not hers. 'She tells me that the only money she can readily access here and now is £40 loaned to her by a friend. 'Had the proper authorities been able to see what the position was with that account in Zurich they might have come to the conclusion it was not her money at all to spend as she wished.' Mr Leathley said Foxley relied upon the goodwill and charity of friends to survive as she was effectively homeless. Scroll down for video . 'This infuriating woman is foxing everyone’s plan to better manage the case, manage the allegations, now convictions, not because she is brazenly cheeky, but because she is in a state of chaos,' he added. 'I have to say that in my humble opinion Caroline Foxley has a personality disorder. 'If I was ever able to publish my diaries this chapter would be entitled ""The strange case of Caroline Foxley"".' Schooling: Foxley's now adult children, Freddie and Miranda, attended schools including Cheltenham Ladies’ College (pictured), Malvern College and Bloxham School in Oxfordshire . 'Infuriating': Foxley's own defence lawyer told Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) that she was 'infuriating, and was 'foxing everyone’s plan to better manage the case' Foxley was convicted following a trial at Gloucester Crown Court of four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009. The three-day trial outlined how Foxley had received £306,000 from the sale of her Cotswold home in 2007, and put around two-thirds of it in an offshore account. She then dipped into the pot to pay school fees for her now adult children, Freddie and Miranda, who attended institutions including Cheltenham Ladies’ College, Malvern College and Bloxham School in Oxfordshire. Convicted: A jury took less than an hour to convict Foxley, who claimed the money from Cotswold District Council and the Department of Work and Pensions . She went on to claim income support and Jobseeker's Allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions, as well as council tax and housing benefits from Cotswold District Council. Such allowances are available only to people with less than £16,000 in capital assets but she did not declare the house proceeds and said she only had £100 in a Lloyds TSB account. Foxley claimed although her name was on the property and the bank accounts she didn’t declare it to the authorities because she did not regard the proceeds as her own and felt it was in trust for her her children's father Dr Meyer, and the two offspring. She said the Dr Meyer, who died last year, stopped supporting her and the children in 2007 and left her riddled with debt - including unpaid school fees. Foxley, who was described during the trial as someone who was 'using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle', said she never touched the money from the house sale as she did not know where it came from and only spent it on his instructions. A jury took less than an hour to convict the benefits cheat, who claimed the money from Cotswold District Council and the Department of Work and Pensions. Today the court heard that Foxley had lined up a £30,000 housekeeping job but that had fallen through because of her trial. 'At the senior age of 59 she is having to graft out a living,' Mr Leathley said. 'She is not living on champagne and caviar, she is a cleaner.' Alexander West, prosecuting, opposed the application to adjourn the sentencing hearing. He said: 'At trial this defendant was found to be dishonest. Explanations put forward today of Mafia involvement or the like should be viewed with that in mind. 'The myriad of excuses and delays of these trial proceedings have brought about significant costs, not only to the prosecution but the public purse.' Assistant Judge Advocate General Alistair McGrigor said the sentencing would be assisted by a probation report and he was reluctantly adjourning the case. 'Your counsel has put forward why I should not sentence you today and I have to say that I am persuaded but very reluctantly,' he said. 'If I felt you were pulling the wool over my eyes you would most certainly be going to prison today.' Foxley, of Shuthonger, Tewkesbury, will be sentenced on a date to be fixed. She was released on conditional bail.","Mother Caroline Foxley, 58, convicted of falsely claiming welfare benefits .

"Karen Kay, from Hull, East Yorkshire, has said her son Jason is now too afraid to have a shower after the lesson at Eastfield Primary School . Primary school children as young as nine have been left terrified of the bathroom after their teacher played them an audio clip from the shower scene of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960s film Psycho. Pupils at Eastfield Primary School, in Hull, were played the clip from the dramatic scene as part of a lesson on how to 'establish mood created by music'. But Karen Kay, from Hull, East Yorkshire, has said her son Jason is now too afraid to have a shower and will not go to the toilet without taking a plastic sword with him. She said: 'I am absolutely disgusted and shocked any teacher would feel this is appropriate. 'Jason has become scared stiff and will not go to sleep on his own. 'He now feels he has to take his plastic sword and knife with him every time he takes a shower or goes to the toilet. 'He is always asking an adult to guard the door while he does whatever he has to do in the bathroom. 'The music to the murder scene is scary and Jason has said the children heard the woman screaming and the body falling in the shower. It’s horrific. 'This has had a massive impact on the way he thinks and I am furious with the school.' The school, in west Hull, said the purpose of the lesson was to 'establish mood created by music'. It has since apologised and says it is reviewing the type of music it plays to children in the future. Scroll down for video . Ms Kay has said she is 'disgusted and shocked any teacher would feel this is appropriate'. Actress Janet Leigh (right) is shown screaming in the famous shower scene of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 thriller Psycho . But Ms Kay said: 'I’ve spoken to other parents about it outside school and they just can’t believe it. Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense thrilled Psycho is ranked among the greatest films of all time. Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch and reportedly loosely inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein, the story centres on the encounter between secretary Marion Crane and motel owner-manager Norman Bates. Crane, played by Janet Leigh, has ended up at the motel after stealing $40,000 from her employer's client before going on the run. The murder scene in the shower, featuring screeching violins to dramatic effect, has become one of the best known scenes in cinematic history. 'I have to literally drag Jason in the shower now and it’s all because of this. 'My message to the school would be for it to look hard at the material it is using and see whether the content matches the age group of the children. 'I don’t mind admitting that I get a bit scared when I hear or see any type of murder scene, so it is no wonder Jason is so frightened - he’s only nine.' Katie Beal, headteacher at Eastfield Primary School, said: 'We have apologised to Jason’s mum and have looked to review the type of music played within lessons in the future.

"If Russians arrive in Brisbane armed with guns they will be 'dealt with', Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart has warned. His strong statement came after police revealed they have not received a request from any foreign security services to carry guns in Australia just 48 hours before the G20 leader's meeting kicks off.

"An elementary school teacher who was fired for feeding an autistic child crayons soaked in hot sauce is being re-instated on the orders of a judge. The Osceola County School District in Florida has been forced to give Lillian Gomez her job back after a judge rejected its appeal to keep her out of the classroom. Gomez, who was fired from Sunrise Elementary School last year, will now work in a different school in the district to 'support other teachers' and she will have access to special needs students. Details have not yet been finalized and the school she will be moving to has not been announced. Scroll down for video . Back to work: Lillian Gomez, an elementary school teacher who soaked crayons in hot sauce and gave them to an autistic child, will be reinstated in a job in the school district after appealing her firing . Gomez was fired in February 2012 after school officials learned that she had put crayons and Play-Doh in a cup and soaked them for days in hot sauce. She then put them in a bag that was labeled with his name. She explained that she had intended to deter the student from eating art supplies, and insisted she had not force fed him the crayons. Her attorney, Thomas Egan, argued that his client was only trying to help the student. 'I think she made a bad judgment in the way she went about it,' he said. 'But her purpose was good.' Jose Holguin, the father of the autistic boy, was enraged to hear that she will be returning to the job. Shock: The victim's father, Jose Holguin, said he believes that Gomez should find a new career path . 'She proved already that she's a danger inside a classroom,' Holguin told WPTV. 'I've said it and I'll say it again, Ms. Gomez, this is not your path. You are not supposed to be teaching.' But school officials said Gomez would be welcomed back at Sunrise. 'We lost the appeal, so by law we have to comply by the courts,' school district spokeswoman Dana Schafer told ABC News. 'We don't want to come out and say anything bad about the teacher or say anything to worry parents.' After Gomez was fired last year, she appealed the decision to an administrative law judge and won. The judge said that while her behavior was inappropriate, she was not trying to punish the boy. Former job: She was fired from Sunrise Elementary School and will be given a job at another school . Incident: She soaked crayons and Play-Doh in hot sauce, claiming it was to deter the child from eating them . But . despite the ruling, the school district refused to take her back, so she went to the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach. Now a year later, the court has upheld the judge's original . order, forcing the district to put her back to work. The school has spent more than $50,000 in legal fees throughout the case arguing that her effectiveness as a teacher was 'severely impaired' following the incident.","Lillian Gomez was fired from her job at a Florida school in Feburary 2012 after soaking crayons in hot sauce and giving them to a child .

"A tycoon allegedly worth nearly £40 million two years ago and who is fighting his estranged wife over cash payments has 'very, very little money', a High Court judge was told today. Michael Prest, who is in his 50s, has 'no source of income' and is looking for a job, Mr Justice Moylan heard at a High Court hearing in London. The businessman's affairs emerged during the latest round of a bitter divorce cash fight - which was earlier this year analysed by the Supreme Court - between Mr Prest and his estranged wife Yasmin, who is also in her 50s. In 2011 a High Court judge had assessed Mr Prest's net assets at £37.5 million and ordered him to make a lump sum payment of £17.5 million to Mrs Prest . In 2011 a High Court judge had assessed Mr Prest's net assets at £37.5 million and ordered him to make a lump sum payment of £17.5 million to Mrs Prest. He said Mr Prest should make periodical payments totalling nearly £300,000 a year to his wife and their four children until the lump sum was paid. Mrs Prest claimed yesterday that Mr Prest was in contempt of court because he owed more than £400,000 in periodical payments. Her claim is due to be fully argued at a hearing early next year - and Mr Prest could be jailed if a judge finds him in contempt. Sarah Dines, for Mr Prest, yesterday told Mr Justice Moylan: 'He tells me is he being truthful and frank. He says he has no source of income and is actively looking for employment.' She said Mr Prest was 'at a loss at what to do to find the money' and added: 'He finds himself in a position where he has very, very little money with which to live. 'He is a man in considerable difficulty, personally, financially and emotionally.' Judges have heard that the couple had married in 1993, had spent most of their time in London, had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean and had lived to a 'very high standard' Jeremy Posnansky QC, for Mrs Prest, told the judge: 'I don't accept any of the evidence presented by Miss Dines.' Judges have heard that the couple had married in 1993, had spent most of their time in London, had properties in Nigeria and the Caribbean and had lived to a 'very high standard'. The judge who ordered Mr Prest to make a lump sum payment of £17.5 million to Mrs Prest had assessed Mr Prest's net assets at £37.5 million. But he said Mr Prest had made 'various attempts' to conceal the extent of assets. And the judge said he had made a wealth assessment 'doing the best he could' on the material available. Properties held in the name of companies Mr Prest had controlled have been a central issue in the cash fight. A High Court judge initially ordered Mr Prest to transfer properties held in the names of companies he controlled. The Court of Appeal disagreed and said Mr Prest did not have to hand property to Mrs Prest. But the Supreme Court - the highest court in the UK - ruled in Mrs Prest's favour at a hearing in London in June. A panel of seven Supreme Court justices said a number of disputed properties were 'held' by Mr Prest's companies but were assets to which he was legally 'entitled'. They said in divorce litigation a court could transfer property to a spouse if the other spouse was 'entitled' to it. And they ruled that seven properties should be transferred to Mrs Prest. No mention was made of the properties at yesterday's hearing before Mr Justice Moylan. Mr Justice Moylan delayed the hearing of Mr Prest's contempt application after being told that Mr Prest was due to have an operation today. He said it would be listed for a date in January or February. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Tycoon Michael Prest has 'no source of income' and 'is looking for work'

"It is a timelapse video that is simply out of this world. Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman shared this incredible footage on Vine this week, showing the cargo spacecraft Cygnus being released from the International Space Station (ISS). The clip shows the Cygnus being released by the ISS robotic arm and beginning to orbit on its own, disappearing into space as the Earth rotates below - all captured at super speed. 'I pushed the ""so long"" button': Astronaut Reid Wiseman has shared another incredible capture from space, a time-lapse video of the cargo spacecraft Cygnus being released from the International Space Station . Flight Engineer Wiseman, who was assisting fellow astronaut Alexander Gerst in the release, captioned the video: 'SpaceVine timelapse - @astro_alex worked the arm and I pushed the “so long” button on #Cygnus'. In July Cygnus carried supplies to the astronauts including food, spacewalking gear, life support equipment, photography and video gear, Nasa revealed on their website. A second video posted by the astronaut shortly afterwards shows the spacecraft's re-entry over the Pacific Ocean. Wiseman has gained a huge following on social media thanks to his jaw-dropping images and videos from space, with over 250,000 followers on Twitter and over 23,000 on video-sharing platform Vine. Going: Cygnus carried supplies to the astronauts including food, spacewalking gear, life support equipment, photography and video gear . Gone: The Cygnus disappears into space, but its fiery re-entry was also captured on video by the astronauts . The 38-year-old's most memorable captures include a video of lightning storms over Italy, Typhoon Halong covering the Earth, and incredible pictures of the aurora. He also had many baffled in August when he shared a picture of mysterious green lights off the coast of Thailand, with followers down on Earth throwing around theories including bioluminescent algae and nuclear waste. The lights were later revealed to be fishing boats. Wiseman has been on the ISS since May, and In June became the first ISS crew member to send a Vine from space. Incredible: Wiseman last month shared jaw-dropping images of the aurora . Sharing images from ISS over social media has been popular with Nasa astronauts for some time however. Commander Chris Hadfield's posts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr also gained a huge following for his unique perspective over Earth.","Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman shared the incredible footage online .

"New claims: Psychologist Glenn Schellenberg, a professor at the University of Toronto, says that research claiming that children who take music lessons perform better academically is misleading . It is just one of the ways in which ambitious  parents try to give their children an edge at school. But making a child learn a musical instrument   to boost their academic achievement is a waste of money, according to scientists. Although research has shown that youngsters who take music lessons are more likely to be top of their class, a psychologist claims this link  is misleading. Instead, improved academic performance may be because brighter children from privileged backgrounds are more likely to learn an instrument, rather than music classes helping to boost their intelligence. ‘Music may change you a bit, but it’s also the case that different children take music lessons,’ said Professor Glenn Schellenberg of the  University of Toronto, who added that parents’ education was the most influential factor on musicality. He told the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual conference in Boston: ‘Children who take music lessons come from families with higher incomes, they come from families with more educated parents, they also do more extra-curricular activities, they have higher IQs, and they do better at school.’ In tests on 167 children who played piano or other instruments, they found their answer to personality tests could predict how likely it was for them to continue their music lessons. Those who were more outgoing and conscientious were more likely to continue to play. Although children who took music lessons did better at school, when the researchers adjusted the results to take into account their social  background, there was no link to increased intelligence. Instead, the research suggested upbringing and background played a crucial role. Asked if so-called helicopter parents were wasting their money sending their children to music lessons in the belief they could boost their school results, Professor Schellenberg agreed. ‘You can explain almost all of the data that are out there by saying that high-functioning kids take music lessons,’ he added. But Daniel Levitin from the McGill . University, Canada, said: ‘There are benefits to having a society where . more people are engaged with the arts, so even if music instruction . doesn’t make you a better mathematician or a better athlete, even if it . only gives you the enjoyment of music, I think that is a good end in and . of itself.’ Clever: Professor Schellenberg says that brighter pupils are naturally more likely to take music lessons .","Psychologist Glenn Schellenberg tested 167 children who play instruments .

"Police have started searching properties near the home where three missing women were imprisoned for a decade after one of the victims told police there could be other girls, it has emerged. Michelle Knight, who was found at the Cleveland home on Monday after being held against her will for more than 10 years, said that there was another girl at the home around 10 years ago. But Knight, who herself was kidnapped in 2002, said the victim then disappeared. In police interviews she added that she did not know how many other women were in the house because they were all locked in separate rooms, Fox News reported. Scroll down for video . Found: Three women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday, but police are now searching more nearby properties after one victim said there could have been more women . Along with his alleged victims, only Ariel Castro lived at the home at Seymour Avenue. His older brother Pedro lived at his mother's home, while Onil, the youngest of the three brothers, lived alone in his own home 'somewhere in the lower west side', police said. The details could give hope to the . family of Ashley Summer, who was 14 when she vanished on July 6, 2007 in . the same neighborhood from where Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were taken. Initially Ashley was considered a runaway as had she lived with her great-uncle and they had argued prior to her disappearance. But a year later the police and FBI . believed Ashley was an 'endangered juvenile' who could be 'being held . again her will'. In 2009, the FBI said they suspected a link between . Ashley’s disappearance and those of Berry and DeJesus. Where is she? The family of Ashley Summers, . (pictured left and right in an 'age-progressed' rendering of her as . might would look now) said they initially thought she could be among the . found women . Probe: Members of the FBI evidence response team carry out evidence from the home on Tuesday . Ashley's physical appearance and the . proximity of her home to the other disappearances lead investigators to . suspect the cases were linked and that all three might have been . kidnapped by the same man. Interview: Victim Michelle Knight said she saw another woman at the home around 10 years ago . Special Agent Vicki Anderson, of the FBI Cleveland Division told Cleveland.com on Tuesday that Ashley remains in their thoughts as they gather evidence at Ariel Castro's Seymore Avenue home. ‘We are keeping Ashley in our . thoughts as we go every step of the way,’ she said. ‘Whether it is . something we find at the house, or someone seeing the stories remembers . something, we continue our search for Ashley.’ A cadaver dog, along with various law enforcement officers, searched Ariel Castro's Cleveland home on Tuesday, said Anderson. But police . revealed they had not found any human remains at the house despite fears . up to five babies could be buried in the garden. But police did confirm on Wednesday that they found ties and chains inside the home. 'We have confirmation that they were bound, and there (were) chains and ropes in the home,' Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said, adding that authorities did not miss opportunities to find them. Prior . to the disclosure of the naming of the women discovered on Monday, . Summers' family had briefly thought their daughter could be amongst . those discovered. 'We're hoping that it's connected, and they knew where she was,' her aunt Debra Summers told CNN. 'We're hoping for a miracle.' Found: Gina DeJesus, left, was just 14 when she . vanished in 2004, while another alleged victim Amanda Berry, right, was 16 when she went missing in 2003. Both women were found on Monday . Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing . The Summers family is renewing . their efforts to publicize Ashley's disappearance. The FBI's missing . person website says Ashley Summers has a tattoo of 'Gene' enclosed in a . heart on her upper arm, and her birthday is June 16, 1993, making her 19 . years old. Investigators will speak to Gina . DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight to see if they know anything . about Summers' disappearance. On . Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 'Every single lead was followed up on . no matter how small. We dug up yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] . real hero is Amanda Berry.' Until now the search for the missing women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter disappointment for the desperate families. Michelle Knight, who was 20 years old . when she went missing in August 2002, was last seen at a cousin's house . near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue. This map shows the block, Lorain Avenue, in Cleveland where the three girls went missing, years apart. They were found Monday on Seymour Avenue, approximately three miles from where they were abducted . Combing: Cleveland police and FBI agents search a yard. There were apparently signs that dirt had recently been moved in the backyard of the house . Hunt: FBI personnel take evidence from the house where Ariel Castro lived with his alleged victims . Hunt: Reports said authorities are now looking at other properties in the area after a victim was interviewed . Three . years later, in April 2003, Amanda Berry, disappeared after leaving her . job at a Burger King - at West 110th Street and Lorain. It was the day . before her 17th birthday. And a year later, Gina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was last seen leaving her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain. All . three were found safe on Monday night after Berry bolted from a home on . Seymour Avenue, about three miles from where they were last seen. She . told police that she and the other girls were being held prisoner by . Ariel Castro, 52, who has been arrested along with his two brothers, Pedro and Onil, on . suspicion of kidnapping. Cadaver . dogs appeared at the home following fears babies were born inside the . Cleveland house. At least five children may have born at the house, . police sources told NewsChannel5. One . victim suffered up to three miscarriages because she was so . malnourished, while other sources told WKYC the captors would beat the . pregnant women, so that the babies would not survive. Ashley Summers was 14 years old  when she was reported missing in 2007 from her home in the same neighborhood where Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus had vanished . It is unknown what happened to any . children who were born at the home, but one six-year-old girl, Jocelyn, . was found inside the home. She was born to victim Amanda Berry, . 27, while she was imprisoned, and authorities said she is 'happy and . healthy' despite growing up in captivity. Authorities are now investigating how the horrors inside the home went undetected for so long. Neighbour . Israel Lugo said other neighbors had seen naked women crawling on all . fours behind Castro's house. Three men were in the garden and were . controlling the women, he said. 'We . thought it was funny at first, and then we thought that was weird so we . called the cops,' neighbor Nina Samoylicz told CNN. 'They thought we . was playing, joking, they didn't believe us.' Neighbors waited for police for two hours but no patrol cars showed up. Brothers: From left, Ariel, Onil and Pedro have all been arrested in connection with the abduction of Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight almost ten years ago . Cleveland police said that the department has no records of a call for service to that home. But the claim is one of a number of stories to have emerged from neighbors who say they reported unusual goings-on at Castro's Seymour Avenue, Cleveland home to local police who either didn't respond or didn't enter the house when they did show up. Lugo said he also called police after his sister saw a woman and a baby standing in a window at the home which was half covered by a plank. Lugo also said his mother was puzzled when Castro would park outside the home in his yellow school bus. He would go inside clutching bags of McDonalds and sodas. It has emerged that Ariel Castro would allegedly use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried to run free. Reunited: Amanda Berry (center) at the Cleveland Hospital alongside her emotional sister (left) and daughter Jocelyn that she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will . Relief: Ricky DeJesus, brother of Gina, holds his head in his hand outside his family's home in Cleveland . It is said to be just one of the manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging from the ceiling. But on Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: 'Every single lead was followed up on no matter how small. We dug up yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] real hero is Amanda Berry.' Until now the search for the missing women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter disappointment for the desperate families. The . exact circumstances of the abductions is currently unclear, and it is . not known whether or not the kidnapper deliberately targeted the block . where all three victims were taken. The three brothers are expected to be arraigned before the end of the day.","Michelle Knight, who was found at the home on Monday, told police there was once another woman at the house .

"Labour is today cast as the ‘Downton Abbey party’ which refuses to back opportunities for poorer people which have been enjoyed by the political elite. Education Secretary Michael Gove is to use a speech to accuse Ed Miliband of reacting to the idea of increasing the aspirations of students with the ‘horror’ of the Earl of Grantham in the ITV drama to the news that a chauffeur wanted to marry his daughter. In a surprise reversal of class-based political attacks, Mr Gove will claim Labour believes working class pupils should ‘stick to their station in life’ and not enjoy the elite Oxford education enjoyed by the party’s leadership. Labour leader Ed Miliband's reaction to raising . aspirations for working class students is likened to when Downton's Earl . of Grantham learned his daughter wanted to marry a chauffeur . In a speech to the Social Market . Foundation tonight, Mr Gove will defend the Government’s English . Baccalaureate measure, which recognised students who secured at least a C . grade in English, Maths, two sciences, a language and a humanities . subject. The measurement, . introduced two years ago, had been greeted with ‘visceral horror’ from . the Labour party and the unions, he is expected to say. ‘How . dare anyone - let alone the Department for Education - reveal how many . state school students were getting the sort of education that enables . the children of the rich to dominate British life?’ The eBacc inspired opposition ‘because it revealed how poorly served so many state students were’, he will say. Education Secretary Michael Gove will accuse Labour of being the 'Downton Abbey party' refusing to raise the aspirations of working class students . Mr . Gove claims the attitude among the Labour leadership is like that of . the landed gentry in ITV’s landed gentry, who do not believe that the . working classes and the servants should enjoy the same privileges that . they do. He will contrast the privileged . education of Mr Miliband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow . education secretary Stephen Twigg who all studied Philosophy, Politics . and Economics at Oxford with the lack of ambition for students from . poorer backgrounds. Education Secretary Michael Gove will accuse Labour of opposing measures designed to increase achievement of poorer pupils . And he . will draw on the explosive storyline when the Earl of Grantham . discovered  Lady Sybil was running away to marry Irish chauffeur Tom . Branson. ‘At the moment just . 16 per cent of students in the state sector secure the EBacc. Only 23 . per cent are even entered for it. More than three-quarters of state . school students have been denied access to the qualifications which will . empower them to choose their own path,’ he will say. ‘But for Labour that’s not only no cause for concern – it’s a truth which should be suppressed. ‘The . current leadership of the Labour Party react to the idea that working . class students might study the subjects they studied with the same . horror that the Earl of Grantham showed when a chauffeur wanted to marry . his daughter. ‘Labour, under their current leadership, want to be the Downton Abbey party when it comes to educational opportunity. ‘They . think working class children should stick to the station in life they . were born into – they should be happy to be recognised for being good . with their hands and not presume to get above themselves.’ The ITV drama was rocked by the revelation that aristocrat Lady Sybil had fallen in love with Irish chauffeur Tom Branson . Mr Gove will say that claims of ‘rapid and relentless educational improvement’ under Labour which saw GCSE results soar have been ‘shown up as a far more complex narrative of inequality and untapped potential’. He will add: ‘But instead of using this information to demand that poorer children at last enjoy the education expected by the privileged, far too many on the left attacked the very idea that poor children might aspire to such an entitlement.’ Labour hit back tonight, insisting there remains widespread opposition to the plans. Mr Twigg said: 'Michael Gove is clearly rattled by the widespread opposition to his EBacc exams. Instead of lecturing others, he should listen to business leaders, entrepreneurs, headteachers and parents who think his plans are backward looking and narrow. 'We need to get young people ready for a challenging and competitive world of work, not just dwell on the past.'","Education Secretary accuses Labour of opposing English Baccalaureate which aims to raise aspirations .

"Mexican drug cartels are finding it easier to smuggle drugs into the U.S. thanks to border patrol officials being forced to deal with an unprecedented crisis of illegal migrants. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbot recently requested an additional $30 million (£17.6m) in funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help deploy more resources to the area. It comes on the heels of a massive 92 per cent spike from the same period last year in minors being apprehended at the border, thought to be mostly from Central American countries such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Scroll down for video . Detainees wait in a Texas holding cell, where authorities are dealing with a massive spike in unaccompanied children attempting to cross the border via Mexico and the Rio Grande . In his request for funding, Abbot described an 'extraordinary influx' of unaccompanied minors to Texas via the state's border from Mexico. 'With the Border Patrol’s focus shifted to this crisis, we have grave concerns that dangerous cartel activity, including narcotics smuggling and human trafficking, will go unchecked because Border Patrol resources are stretched too thin. 'Unless the Department of Homeland Security or another federal agency provides funding, the cartels - which are central to this crisis - will prevail because they profit from each illegal border crossing.' Chris Cabrera, a Border Patrol union representative told The Washington Post that smugglers were exploiting gaps created in the border when agents were pulled from their stations to deal with groups of people crossing the Rio Grande river. He told the paper groups as large as 250 wade across and distract officers while the drug traffickers creep across hoping to pass by undetected. 'After that they send over the dope,' he said. Young detainees are pictured being escorted to make phone calls at a processing centre in Nogales, Arizona . In the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, the Border Patrol made more than 160,000 apprehensions of illegal migrants between October 2013 and May 2014 - an increase of 70 percent over the same period the year before. Authorities arrested 47,017 unaccompanied minors illegally crossing the border between October and May, up 92 percent from the same period a year earlier, with more than two-thirds of these arrests in the Rio Grande Valley. Startling photos taken last week document a handful of failed border crossing attempts - the images show young children and even babies sleeping in holding cells at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection processing facility in Brownsville, Texas, where they are held before being deported.","There are fears more drugs are being brought into the U.S. by cartels south of the border, who are ready to exploit stretched Border Patrol resources .

"'Liberation didn't happen': Feminist academic Germaine Greer believes men are even less tolerant of women than in the 1970s . Germaine Greer has claimed  that women are worse off than ever because of the proliferation of  online pornography and the torrent of abuse they have to endure on social media such as Twitter. The sites have become a forum for ‘the loathing of women’, says Greer, whose ground-breaking book The Female Eunuch revolutionised feminist thinking in the 1970s. ‘Liberation hasn’t happened, even sexual liberation didn’t happen,’ she argues. ‘What happened was that commercial pornography was  liberated, fantasy was liberated, but people weren’t liberated.’ The Australian academic delivers her damning verdict in a BBC TV documentary - Blurred Lines: The New Battle Of The Sexes - which looks at the threats of rape and violence directed towards women online as well as the ‘objectification’ of women in violent computer games and sexually explicit pop videos. Greer, 75, tells presenter Kirsty Wark: ‘Things have got a lot worse for women since I wrote The  Female Eunuch.’ She claims the abuse directed at some women online is proof that men are more intolerant of women than ever before. ‘I never thought once you had social media there would become this terrible grab bag of loathing of women,’ she says. ‘Men are now more aware of women because women keep pushing themselves in. ‘Nowadays women expect to share men’s lives, they want to do the same work, they want to play the same games, they want to have the same social life, and I think it’s driving men nuts. And the result would seem to me  to be that men are even  less tolerant of women than they were before. ‘Now if men have always needed women to be in a subservient, filial, ancillary position, when they [women] stand up and call attention to themselves, it produces reactions which are difficult to manage.’ Several high-profile women have suffered abuse at the hands of online ‘trolls’. The author and feminist Caroline Criado-Perez was targeted after  she launched a petition calling for female historical figures to be represented on banknotes. Used to be better: Greer is pictured above in 1974 - before the online 'grab bag of loathing of women' The campaign was a success and the Bank of England announced  that from 2017, Jane Austen would be on a new £10 note. But the campaigner found herself inundated with highly personal abuse and threats. At one stage she was receiving 50 threats an hour, and she was so affected that she lost half a stone  in two days. Professor Mary Beard was targeted in a similar manner after she spoke out about immigration on BBC’s Question Time last year. The historian had to contend with highly personal comments about her appearance as well as a picture of her face with female genitalia superimposed on it. Prof Beard tells the documentary that such attacks will not deter her from speaking out. She said: ‘You do have to steel yourself a little bit because it is quite affecting when you get this stuff. But most of all it is infuriating. My views on anything are irrelevant to the size and shape of my vagina, I’m sorry.’ Prof Beard is worried, though,  that such campaigns may deter other women from entering ‘the public sphere’. She said: ‘I have decided I am going to face the music. But there must be loads of women who think, that is not what I want. ‘I don’t want that kind of rubbish and it’s vile. It really is vile. Why would anyone bother to do this unless they were incredibly determined? It is very bad for women’s participation in the public sphere.’","Academic said that online sphere is a 'grab bag of loathing of women'

"Subjects like hairdressing will no longer count towards a school's league table results . More than 3,000 discredited vocational courses will be downgraded because pupils are shunning tough subjects, Michael Gove declared yesterday. Schools will be barred from using ‘dead-end’ qualifications – including courses in ‘personal effectiveness’, fish husbandry and nail technology services – to count towards their league table rankings. Youngsters will instead be encouraged to gain at least a C in English and maths and study science and a language. The Education Secretary warned against pandering to the view that school is ‘like the movies or a club’ where pupils expect to find lessons ‘exciting’ – and drop out if they are too difficult. ‘If we say that we will tolerate or accept non-attendance on the basis that school is too hard then we are condemning children to a future where, at every stage they face a challenge, we make excuses rather than encouraging them to do better, and that way lies perdition,’ Mr Gove told the Commons education select committee. ‘It’s unacceptable that people are bristling at the requirement that we have children doing English, mathematics and science to an acceptable level.’ Michael Gove said changes to education would take time but would benefit children . Under a GCSE ‘equivalence’ system . introduced by Labour, schools were allowed to count more than 3,000 . vocational courses towards their league table position. The courses were deemed equivalent to . one or more GCSEs and given league table points in an attempt to . motivate disaffected pupils. One approved course was a Level 2 . Certificate of Personal Effectiveness, which taught children how to . claim the dole. A report commissioned by the Coalition . found that many of the qualifications were ‘effectively dead-end’ with . no use in the job market. Its author, Professor Alison Wolf, of King’s . College London, said schools had been entering pupils for the courses . just to amass league table points. Mr Gove announced yesterday that only . 125 out of 3,175 vocational qualifications for 14 to 16-year-olds meet . new criteria for inclusion in league tables.

"He’s proved that electric cars can be sexy and has designed his own spacecraft. Now Elon Musk is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to connect remote parts of the world to the internet - an aim shared by other tech companies. The billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites. High flier:  Elon Musk (pictured) is setting his sights on satellites and wants to use them to get remote parts of the world online. The billionaire entrepreneur is reportedly exploring ways to create small and cheap satellites in a project that would pit him against Google and Facebook . He is working with Greg Wyler, a satellite expert and former Google employee who was involved until recently with developing Google's bid to get less developed parts of the world online, The Wall Street Journal reported. The race is on to connect the two-thirds of the planet without internet access, with Google and Facebook both announcing grand plans to roll out access using satellites, drones and even giant balloons. Mr Wyler founded WorldVu Satellites, based in the Channel Islands, which controls a large block of radio spectrum and is said to talking to industry executives – along with Mr Musk – about plans to launch around 700 satellites, each weighing just 250lbs (113kg). The satellites would be half the weight of the smallest kind used at the moment and the constellation would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet. The duo may build a factory to make the satellites, either in Florida or Colorado. Two-thirds of the world still remain without internet access. Google is planning to change this by launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online and now Elon Musk and an ex-Google employee plan to launch around 700 satellites in an even larger project . Elon musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet. He said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert Greg Wyler, of WorldVu Satellites. The duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet. They would each weigh just 250lbs (113kg) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering. The duo is considering opening a factory in Florida or Colorado to build their creations for a cost of at least $1 billion (£600 million). Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk’s firm Space X but there are many obstacles in the way. Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk’s firm Space X, which has 48 launches planned by 2018. Last month, the company won a $2.6 billion (1.6 billion) contract to develop, test and fly ‘space taxis’ for Nasa in order to put US astronauts into orbit. However, there are many obstacles that need to be overcome before the satellites are deemed a success. They are predicted to cost $1 billion (£600 million) to develop and may be able to be launched until the end of the decade, depending on Space X’s schedule. Mr Musk’s involvement in the long-term is not certain and WorldVu risks losing its spectrum in 2030 too. The company currently controls a  block of radio spectrum in the Ku band, communicating in the microwave range of between 12 and 18 GHz. In June, it was announced that Google is planning on launching a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. According to sources close to the company, it plans on spending more than $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology. Mr Wyler was working at Google on the final design of the satellites, which are thought to be small, high-capacity and intended to orbit the Earth at 'lower altitudes than traditional satellites'. Before Mr Wyler left Google, there were reportedly plans to make small, high-capacity satellites designed to orbit the Earth at 'lower altitudes than traditional satellites'. There is also a project in the world to launch giant balloons to connect remote regions to the internet . Google: The internet giant is said to be planning the launch of a fleet of 180 satellites to provide web access for the 4.8 billion people not yet online. The project was led by Mr Wyler. Google is tipped to spend $1 billion (£600 million) on the technology and is also planning on using balloons and drones. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. Facebook: Mark Zuckerburg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. Small satellite manufacturers: Sierra Nevada and Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology are both adept at making increasingly cheap small satellites and have a good track record. He only stayed for around one year before leaving to work with Mr Musk. Sources close to him told The WSJ that Mr Wyler’s relationship with Google broke down because he doesn't think Google has the manufacturing experience needed for such a commitment. Google did not comment. If the ambitious project goes ahead, Mr Musk and Mr Wyler will be competing with established firms such as Sierra Nevada and Britain’s Surrey Satellite Technology. They will also be going head-to-head with Google and Facebook too. Google's Project Loon aims to launch high-altitude balloons to provide broadband service to remote locations below. The helium-filled balloons are designed to inflate to 49ft (15 metres) in diameter and carry transmitters that could beam 3G-speed internet to remote regions. It's hoped that it could save developing countries the high cost of laying fibre cables to get online and lead to a dramatic increase in internet access for the likes of Africa and south-east Asia. In April, the company also acquired Titan Aerospace, which is building solar-powered drones to provide similar connectivity. Facebook, meanwhile, has its own drone plans. In March, Mark Zuckerberg revealed solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries. In April, Google acquired Titan Aerospace and is building solar-powered drones to provide connectivity. Facebook has its own drone plans. Mark Zuckerberg said solar-powered drones, satellites and lasers are all being developed in the firm's labs to deliver the internet to underdeveloped countries . He has pledged to work on technology to deliver the internet to 'the next 3 billion people' - and revealed the firm has hired experts in solar power that can keep drones flying for months at a time. The Institution of Engineering and Technology's president, Professor William Webb, said: 'The idea of using aerial platforms to deliver connectivity is one that is many decades old, from low-orbital satellites to balloons and more recently unmanned aerial vehicles.' 'The difficulty has always been one of keeping the aerial platform in the right place in the sky for weeks or months at a low enough cost. As technologies mature we get ever closer to achieving this and Facebook's intervention in this space is a welcome boost to the area.' Companies such as Facebook and Google have a checkered . history with privacy, and many have voiced concerns about how the site could . use drones to collect data about people. In theory, the drones could be . used to take aerial images, or collect details about wireless networks and . individuals. As Facebook and Google's drones will be . used to provide internet to people home's, there will need to be a limited . amount of data collection to connect the homes to the network. With this in mind, they are . likely to be subject to strict regulation. In the U.S, for example, the . Federal Aviation Authority's (FAA) guidelines state private operators  are . allowed to fly their drones ‘recreationally’ and commercial drones are . 'prohibited.' However, earlier this year Judge Patrick Geraghty, from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) dismissed a fine, which the FAA had placed on a drone photographer. Geraghty said Raphael Pirker’s . camera drone was ‘not subject to [federal regulation] and enforcement,’ and . therefore the fine wasn't valid. It is unsure exactly what this . ruling will mean for companies such as Amazon, and now Facebook, but it could . see the restrictions relaxed. The FAA is appealing. Facebook and Google are also . planning to use these drones in areas outside the U.S., and it will depend on . the individual country's laws on unmanned aircraft and surveillance. Mr Musk and Mr Wyler both want to cut the cost of the technology, not least because WorldVu needs a lot of satellites. Mr Musk has an enviable track record of reducing the cost of space travel by simplifying the design of rockets and building components in-house and it is hoped he will help to develop satellites that cost under $1 million (£629,008), instead of several million as they do at the moment.","Tesla entrepreneur is said to be working with a satellite expert to develop cheaper and lighter technology with plans to launch a constellation of 700 .

"Brain tissue has been made in a laboratory for the first time amid hopes the work could aid research into dementia and head injuries (file picture) Brain tissue has been created in a laboratory for the first time amid hopes the work could aid research into dementia and head injuries. So-called brain 'doughnuts' made from partitioned nerve cells and fibres have been grown by scientists in the US. In future, they could be used to study damage caused by injury and disease, improve understanding of brain function, or aid the development of new treatments. They could also provide an alternative to distressing tests conducted on animals. Each doughnut 'ring' consists of neuron cell bodies, while bundles of connecting axon fibres fill the centre. The structures, measuring up to 1.2 centimetres across, mimic the kind of compartmentalisation found in a real brain. Professor David Kaplan, who led the bioengineers at Tufts University in the US, said: 'There are few good options for studying the physiology of the living brain, yet this is perhaps one of the biggest areas of unmet clinical need when you consider the need for new options to understand and treat a wide range of neurological disorders associated with the brain. 'To generate this system that has such great value is very exciting for our team.' Until now neurons have only been grown in a haphazard, unstructured fashion in the laboratory. The new approach replicates the complex organisation of real brain tissue, which segregates itself into regions of 'grey' and 'white' matter. Grey matter consists of nerve cell bodies while white matter is made up of axons, the long fibres that carry nerve signals. To make the doughnut, the scientists cut a spongy silk protein scaffold into a ring shape and seeded it with rat neurons. The middle of the doughnut was then filled with a collagen-based gel. In just a few days, the neurons formed functional networks around the pores of the scaffold. They also sent axon projections through the centre gel to connect with neurons on the opposite side. Eventually a distinct white matter region formed in the centre of the doughnut that was separated from the surrounding grey matter. Tests showed that the brain-like constructs could be kept alive in the laboratory for more than two months. Experiments that involved dropping weights on to the doughnuts from varying heights demonstrated their potential for studying brain injury. The results of work carried out to create brain tissue for the first time has been described by researchers as 'very exciting' 'With the system we have, you can essentially track the tissue response to traumatic brain injury in real time,' said Prof Kaplan. 'Most importantly, you can also start to track repair and what happens over longer periods of time.' He added: 'The fact that we can maintain this tissue for months in the lab means we can start to look at neurological diseases in ways that you can't otherwise because you need long timeframes to study some of the key brain diseases.' Co-author Professor Philip Haydon, also from Tufts University, said: 'This model provides a unique opportunity for mapping out real-time neurophysiological events and function studies in the laboratory, monitoring that is prohibitive with humans or animals.' Details of the research appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.","Brain tissue created in laboratory for first time by researchers in America .

"Esteemed author Harper Lee has denied giving permission to a journalist to document her life in a highly-anticipated new memoir. The reclusive writer of To Kill A Mockingbird has shunned the spotlight following the success of her Pulitzer prize-winning first and only novel in 1960, refusing to do interviews or make public appearances. However Marja Mills, a former Chicago Tribune reporter, claims to have become friends with Lee after moving into the house next door to her in Monroeville, Alabama, for 18 months in 2004. Mills has now written a book about the experience, The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee, which was released by The Penguin Press on Tuesday and is being pushed as the first official account of Lee's life. Hitting back: Extremely private author Harper Lee, 88, has released a statement saying she did not cooperate with a new book about her life and that she was 'saddened' and 'hurt' by the writer . Under fire: Journalist Marja Mills (left) maintains she was always honest with Harper Lee during their 18-month friendship that she was writing a book . As Mills writes: 'I wasn't an unknown quantity but someone she (Harper Lee) knew and trusted.' 'I could not have done (the book) without the trust, support, and encouragement of Nelle (as Harper Lee is known) and (her sister) Alice Lee and their closest friends.' But Lee, 88, has now released a letter to Entertainment Weekly to deny having anything to do with the project. 'Miss Mills befriended my elderly sister, Alice. It did not take long to discover Marja's true mission: another book about Harper Lee,' the statement said. 'I was hurt, angry, saddened, but not surprised. 'I immediately cut off all contact with Miss Mills, leaving town whenever she headed this way. 'Rest assured, as long as I am alive, any book purporting to be with my cooperation is a falsehood.' It is the second statement Lee has released on the book. The first was dated April 27, 2011. At the time Lee wrote: 'Contrary to recent news reports, I have not willingly participated in any book written or to be written by Marja Mills. Neither have I authorized such a book.' A big part of the dispute is a letter Mills has written by Lee's sister Alice. 'Delicious mystery': Harper Lee, 88, has lived an extremely private life since the release of her first and only book, To Kill A Mockingbird, in 1960 . Responding to the claims on Tuesday, Mills refers to the letter, while maintaining her book is not a Harper Lee biography but a collection of stories that Lee chose to share with her. The written letter I have from Alice Lee, which she sent May 2011 in response to the original letter issued in Nelle's name, makes clear that Nelle Harper Lee and Alice gave me their blessing,' Mills said. 'In regard to the writing and release of Nelle Harper Lee's April 2011 statement about my book, Alice Lee (Alice Lee practiced law until she was 100 years old) wrote: 'Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence. Now she has no memory of the incident.' "" Penguin also released a statement on Tuesday, saying: 'Penguin Press is proud to publish The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee by Marja Mills today. The book, a southern gothic novel that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1962, has sold over 30 million copies . This photo of Harper Lee, taken in an Alabama courthouse, was shot around the time she released To Kill A Mockingbird in 1960 . 'Mills' memoir is a labor of love and Marja Mills has done an extraordinary job. We look forward to sharing her story of the wise and wonderful Lee sisters with readers.' Early reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. USA Today book critic Charles Finch gave it 3.5 stars out of four, calling it a 'thoughtful, sweet-tempered, witty piece of work."" He also noted that ""Mills wrote her story with the approval of both sisters, and it sometimes reads more like a friend's account than a reporter's, which may be why it doesn't pry too insistently into Lee's secrets.' To Kill A Mockingbird has sold more than 30 million copies. Lee has not given an official interview since the book came out, but has intermittently released statements to media. She has been described as a 'delicious mystery', and while having started other books, one a non-fiction about an Alabama serial killer, she filed them away as unfinished. She is said to have been crippled by the pressure to match the success of her debut.","New memoir The Mockingbird Next Door: Life With Harper Lee is a collection of stories reporter Marja Mills was told by Harper Lee over a year-long friendship .

"Comprehensive schools prevent pupils from poor backgrounds achieving their potential, a study has claimed. Researchers compared reading standards in countries which have retained grammar schools with those which have phased them out, such as the UK. They found that family wealth played next to no part in a child’s achievements when they were taught according to ability. But a disadvantaged background was more likely to count against youngsters in countries that shun selective education. Comprehensive schools prevent pupils from poor backgrounds achieving their potential, a study has claimed . British pupils were among the worst affected in Europe, with only those from Sweden lagging further behind. The study, published in the European Sociological Review, examined the reading performance of tens of thousands of 15-year-olds across 22 nations. It cross-checked the results against the teenagers’ socio-economic status and the type of education system prevalent in their home country. The results showed how much influence wealth had on pupils’ marks. Overall, 9.4 per cent of the variance in UK performance was explained by the student’s social background, compared with a European average of 4.5 per cent. Scandinavian countries, which have even fewer remaining selective schools than Britain, also had high figures, with Sweden on 9.6 per cent and Norway on 8.1 per cent. The study, published in the European Sociological Review, examined the reading performance of tens of thousands of 15-year-olds across 22 nations (stock picture) However, countries which have retained selective education have virtually eliminated class disadvantage. Germany had the lowest figure at 1.4 per cent, followed by Hungary (1.5 per cent), Romania (1.6 per cent) and Austria (2.6 per cent). The study by France’s National Institute for Demographic Studies set out to prove selective education discriminated against children from poor backgrounds. But it admitted that, against expectation, ‘in early differentiated systems rather than comprehensive ones, primary effects of social origin express less within schools’.","Comprehensive schools prevent pupils from poor backgrounds achieving their potential, a study has claimed .

"What does Hollywood have against the British? Once again on Oscar night, Tinsel Town gave warmly to us with one hand — while cynically taking away with the other. The good news is that at least nine Britons will fly back across the Atlantic with coveted golden statues. But the bad news is that Argo — the movie that won Best Film — is yet another piece of Hollywood’s Brit-bashing junk history that casts us in a poor light. Scroll down for video . Winner: Argo, starring and directed by Ben Affleck picked up Best Picture Oscar, but plays fast and loose with the facts of the British involvement in the Islamic revolution in Iran . According to the Affleck version of the rescue mission, the U.S. Embassy staff were turned away by British diplomats . The film, directed by and starring Ben Affleck, tells the story of how the Canadian government and the CIA managed to rescue six American diplomats from the clutches of the Iranian students who occupied the U.S. embassy during the 1979 Islamic revolution. Although the movie is a cracker — tense and terrifying — like so much that comes out Hollywood, Argo plays fast and loose with the facts. And unsurprisingly, the Brits are given a real pasting. For, according to the Affleck version of the rescue mission, the six embassy staff were refused refuge by British diplomats. ‘Brits turned them away,’ says a senior CIA character in the film. You can imagine the outraged comments over industrial buckets of popcorn in movie theatres from Alabama to Alaska. ‘Goddamn Limeys! So that’s what we get for bailing them out during World War II.’ The truth, however, could not be more different. The British did give their American colleagues sanctuary. Far from being cowards, the Brits were heroes. Many of the British diplomats then stationed in Iran are still alive — and they’re fuming. ‘When I first heard about this film, I was really quite annoyed,’ says Sir John Graham, 86, who was our man in Tehran at the time of the crisis. Sir John is understandably concerned that Argo will become accepted as the definitive history of what happened. He may have a point. The movie also stars 'Breaking Bad' star Bryan Cranston (left) Remember U-571 — the U-boat thriller set in World War II — which saw the Yanks, and not the British and the Poles, capture an Enigma coding machine and turn the course of the war? Or how about the abysmal piece of faux-history that was Mel Gibson’s Braveheart, which depicted the British as the rapacious, murderous oppressors of the noble and romantic Scots? Who can forget Saving Private Ryan, . Steven Spielberg’s World War II epic, that effectively presented D-Day . as an exclusively American effort? The . sad irony is that what really happened in Tehran in 1979 is just as . thrilling as Argo, if not more so — and it involved astonishing British . pluck. Ben Affleck may have won the Oscar for Best Film, but the movie won't be picking up any awards for being historically accurate anytime soon . When the . American Embassy was overrun by armed students on November 4, 1979, five . members of staff managed to escape by a side exit. The remaining 55 . embassy staff were to be held captive for a further 444 days. The . most senior member of the escaped group was Robert Anders, who worked . in the visa department. He decided the best place to find refuge was the . British Embassy. The group made its way through the bustling streets, only to find the British embassy was also surrounded by an angry mob. Thinking . on his feet, Anders quickly took the group back to his flat and from . there tried to contact anybody who might help rescue them. After . a tense night, a call came through from the British embassy informing . the five terrified Americans that it could give them refuge in its . residential compound, which was known as Gulhak. As . Argo neglects to mention, this was an exceedingly brave offer. Both the . British embassy and residential compounds were under serious threat. After what had happened to the Americans, the British understandably . feared an attack on their own staff. The Iranian revolutionaries had . dubbed Britain the ‘Little Satan’, and for our officials to shelter . diplomats from the ‘Great Satan’ (America) meant running a huge risk. The caller told Anders that a British car would come for them later that morning. The Americans sat and waited . . . and waited. What the five anxious Americans could not have known was that the British rescuers had got lost.Diplomats . Martin Williams and Gordon Pirrie spent hours fruitlessly negotiating . the thronging streets in, of all cars, an orange 1976 Austin Maxi one of . them had driven to Tehran all the way from England. But they were . unable to find Anders’s flat. At . around 5pm, the Americans called the British embassy, only to be told . by a diplomat that the Iranians were ‘coming over the walls’. A U.S. hostage, blindfolded and with his hands bound, being displayed to the crowd outside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by Iranian hostage-takers in 1979 . The Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 saw demonstrators climb the wall of the U.S Embassy to burn a flag in defiance . Indeed they were. For as the city . grew dark, an army of students invaded the embassy compound. They broke . into offices and houses, smashing windows and doors. Among . those who witnessed the attack was Imelda Miers, wife of the British . Political Counsellor, David Miers. That night, Lady Miers was in her . house with her son, Thomas, who was aged just seven. ‘My . little boy was terrified, and so was I,’ she recalls. ‘We hid in my . bedroom, but then I decided that was not a great place to hide, in case . they set fire to the house.’ Lady . Miers left her room, hiding Thomas under her coat. She was soon . accosted by six students, all clutching Kalashnikovs, one of whom she . swore could be no older than 12. ‘I . thought they were going to shoot me,’ she says, ‘but when I realised . that they weren’t, I grew angry with them, and asked them if their . mothers knew they were out!’ Along with the other British embassy staff . and their wives and children, Lady Miers and Thomas were taken to a . single building where they were held captive. Although . he was in London at the time, the ambassador Sir John Graham today . suspects the students who attacked the British embassy were looking for . the Americans. ‘They claimed they were after arms,’ says Sir John, ‘but I . don’t think that was true.’ The 10 American hostages being presented to the media at the occupied U.S. Embassy shortly before their release . The American hostages being paraded outside the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 . Meanwhile, Williams and Pirrie had . finally found Anders and his group after hours of driving around the . backstreets of Tehran. The Americans were taken in an edgy drive to the . as-yet-untouched British residential compound. ‘The . Americans were very nervous,’ Williams recalls, ‘and they kept trying . to duck down, which in my view would only look suspicious.’ Happily, they arrived at Gulhak undetected and received a warm welcome. As . the CIA officer Antonio Mendez, who helped to mount the eventual . rescue, recalls in his book, Argo: ‘The British were kind hosts, and . offered them a house of their own, fed them a warm meal, even prepared . cocktails.’ So much for . Affleck’s suggestion that the British ‘turned away’ the Americans. Martin Williams’s wife Sue cooked that meal and the Americans went to . bed. But while they slept, the Iranian students were approaching Gulhak. Fired up with the success of  storming the British embassy, they were now ready to seize the residential compound. Standing . at the gate was a Pakistani guard in his 50s called Iskander Khan, who . brilliantly convinced the students the compound was empty — and they . went away. ‘We and the Americans had a very lucky escape,’ says Martin . Williams. ‘We were very grateful to Iskander Khan.’ The . following morning it was decided the Americans would have to move on . for their own safety. Anders and his group were told that they would . have to go, as Gulhak was clearly not secure. According . to the account written by Antonio Mendez, the Americans felt they were . ‘being kicked out’ by the British, but Williams says this is not the . case, as the reasons for leaving Gulhak were ‘self-evident’. Freed American hostages, landing at Frankfurt Airport after a flight from Iran on their way home to the U.S. Argo tells the story of how 6 American diplomats were rescued from the occupied U.S. Embassy during the 1979 revolution . For a few days the five Americans were placed in an empty house belonging to a U.S. official, where they were joined by a colleague who had also escaped from the embassy and had been in hiding. This group of six was eventually saved by the rescue mission organised by the Canadians and the CIA. After the rescue, the story remained secret, kept in classified files. However, the diplomatic community knew the British — and others — had done their bit. A recently-released State Department Briefing Memorandum from February 6, 1980, states that the British embassy was involved in the rescue of the Americans. Many of the British embassy staff from that time have seen Argo. ‘It does not bear all that much relation to the facts,’ observes Sir David Miers drily. ‘It is not a true story.’ Ben Affleck has acknowledged the film casts Britain in a bad light. ‘But I was setting up a situation where you needed to get a sense that these six people had nowhere else to go. It does not mean to diminish anyone,’ he said. Such a defence cuts little ice with Sir John Graham. ‘I can’t see why the film-makers couldn’t have acknowledged that we and others did actually help the diplomats,’ he says. ‘It wouldn’t have ruined the drama at all.’","Film packed with inaccuracies regarding the British involvement in Iranian revolution .

"Science teacher Richard West was suspended and later dismissed after accidentally shooting a student with a pellet gun during a classroom experiment . A teacher who was sacked after accidentally shooting a student during a science experiment has got his job back - after the boy he hit led a campaign for him to be reinstated. Physics teacher Richard West was suspended then sacked because the pellet, fired from an air weapon, rebounded off a table leg and struck sixth-former Ben Barlow in the leg. The incident, which happened in November last year, left pupil Mr Barlow with a minor scratch and resulted in Mr West being dismissed as head of physics at St Peter’s Collegiate School in Wolverhampton last month. Mr Barlow, 17, said: ‘Mr West set up an experiment where he was going to shoot through paper into cardboard boxes at the end of the room to work out the speed of the object and its deceleration. ‘I’m not sure how it happened - but the bullet must have rebounded off the table and it hit me on the leg. ‘You’d do more damage with a safety pin. It was a complete accident and Mr West was really concerned.’ The sixth-form student launched a huge Facebook campaign and petition entitled ‘Bring Back Westy 2014’ which called for his favourite teacher to be given his job back. The campaign, which was backed by 4,500 past and present pupils, was successful and Mr West was reinstated after an appeals committee granted his return. The school – of which One Direction star Liam Payne is a former pupil - has agreed for Mr West, of Bridgnorth, Shropshire, to return to lessons after the Easter holidays on April 28. Adrian Richards, the school’s principal, said: ‘An appeals committee formed from the academy governing body met in response to an appeal lodged by Mr West regarding his dismissal. ‘The appeals committee made the decision to reinstate Mr West with immediate effect. Mr West was dismissed from St Peter's Collegiate School in Wolverhampton last month after accidentally shooting pupil Ben Barlow in the leg with a pellet from an air gun . ‘The committee considered all of the factors presented to them, bearing in mind that the primary focus was on safety of students being of paramount importance, how procedures to ensure the safety of everyone must be adhered to, and how important it is that staff report any accidents which happen on academy premises. ‘In being reinstated, Mr West has given assurances that lessons have been learned. ‘He will ensure complete compliance with all safety procedures and controlled conditions and ensure the correct reporting procedures are followed.’ The school, which caters for 1,300 pupils aged 11-18, was rated Good or Outstanding in a November 2011 Ofsted report. Sixth-form student Ben Barrow launched a huge Facebook campaign entitled 'Bring Back Westy 2014' which called for his favourite teacher to be given his job back at St Peter's Collegiate School in Wolverhampton, pictured .

"A 200-year-old house which was once home to a member of the Cadbury chocolate dynasty has been destroyed in an arson attack. More than 100 firefighters tackled the blaze at Northfield Manor House in Birmingham after being called to the scene shortly after 8.30pm last night. The timber-fronted house, which is two miles away from the former site of the Bournville factory, was lived in by George Cadbury, a son of the firm's founder, John, from 1894 until his death in 1922. The historic building, which was last used as student accommodation, has been empty for seven years and there are fears it may now have to be demolished. Scroll down for video . Burning: . West Midlands Fire Service, who were at the scene throughout the night, . confirmed the fire was 'suspected arson' and are now investigating . Arson attack: Firefighters tackle the blaze at the 200-year-old Northfield Manor House in Birmingham which started last night . Devastating: Crews were at the property for most of the night. It was the home of George Cadbury, son of the confectionery giant's founder, John . Inferno: The fire destroyed most of the timber-fronted house which has been empty since it was sold in 2007 . A West Midlands Police spokesman said no-one was injured in the fire and confirmed that a forensic team will examine the area when it is deemed safe. Chief Fire Officer Phil Loach said on Twitter that it was a 'suspected arson'. 'Firefighters stopped the fire spreading beyond the main house but high unsupported chimneys are making the area hazardous,' he tweeted. He added: 'There are signs of forced entry, the main part of the building has been severely damaged and the flames have spread through the roof. 'The building is in an unsafe condition, there are a number of large chimney stacks which are also unstable.' Crews remained at the site throughout the night, but could not stop the fire from ripping through the property. Barry Whitehead, who lives near the manor house and watched the blaze, said: 'The fire was very intense. The fire crews were very brave to tackle such an intense heat. The smoke could be seen for miles around and as we are almost next door we can still smell it in our flat.' Response: Emergency services were at the scene throughout the night but could not stop the fire destroying parts of the historic house, including the bay windows . Long operation: This morning, firefighters were still trying to put out the last parts of the fire. Residents described how the smoke could be seen for miles . Aftermath: A fire engine is parked outside the wrecked house the morning following the devastating fire. Most of the windows have been blown out . Investigation: A CCTV camera hovers over what remains of the roof of the historic house in Birmingham. Forensic officers will assess the scene when it is safe . Structure: Most of the wooden roof supports have disintegrated while the chimney stacks and brick walls remain standing . Gutted: Firefighters try to put out the fire as it ravages through the roof of the property which was built in 1809 . Resident Thomas Beet-Richardson, 30, from Northfield, said: ‘It’s devastating to see a huge piece of Birmingham history go up like this. It’s a beautiful building and to think somebody might have done this on purpose is heartbreaking. ‘The city has lost a huge part of the  Cadbury story.’ People on Twitter spoke of their shock at the news of the blaze at the historic property. Birmingham Northfield Labour MP Richard Burden tweeted: 'Awful to hear of fire blazing at Northfield Manor. Part of our heritage & our history.' Anthony McCourt added: 'So sad to see the original George Cadbury home (Manor Farm) in flames tonight.' The home has stood derelict since it was sold by Birmingham University in 2007. It had been used as student accommodation for more than 50 years, but rising costs and problems with adhering to health standards meant it was unsafe. It had just been purchased by Banner Homes for redevelopment and was in the middle of the planning process before the fire. Before: The house has stood derelict for the last seven years after it was sold by the University of Birmingham - who used it as student accommodation . Debris: A picture of the interior taken in 2011 shows that the house was covered in debris and was run down . Poor condition: The future of the house was already in doubt, but there are indications it may have to be torn down as a result of the fire . Fittings: Shelves and wardrobes remain from when Northfield Manor House was used as a University of Birmingham halls of residence. It has been empty ever since it was sold in 2007 . Instruments: One of the items in the house was a grand piano. It is not known whether this was destroyed in the fire . Fears: The house, pictured in 2011, was sold seven years ago because the costs of maintaining it had soared and there were concerns it could not adhere to health and safety regulations . Social reformer: George Cadbury moved into the house in 1894 with his family . The house, formally known as Manor Farm, was the home of George and Elizabeth Cadbury. The land which the house stands on was bought in 1809 by Daniel Ledsman. George, the third son of the firm's founder John, then bought the property in 1890 and moved in four years later. He lived there with his family until his death in 1922. His wife continued to reside there until her own death in 1951, aged 93. The house was then purchased by Birmingham University and was converted into halls of residences by 1958. Additional wings of the property were added throughout the latter part of the 20th century, but it was sold in 2007, and has been left empty ever since and has stood derelict every since. It had been bought by Banner Homes for redevelopment and was in the initial planning application stage before the fire. Northfield Manor is two miles away from Bournville, the model village the Cadbury family built to house employees who worked at their nearby factory. George and his brother Richard, who took over the company after the death of their father, were concerned for the well being of their workers, most of whom lived in slum city conditions. So they acquired land outside of Birmingham and moved the factory to a country location. There they built a town called Bournville, named after the nearby river, where the workers resided in bigger houses with their own gardens. It was seen as a huge improvement from the grimy city conditions.","Firefighters were called to the 200-year-old Northfield Manor House in Birmingham last night after reports of a blaze .

"Thousands of coasting schools across the country have fallen foul of a tougher inspection regime, figures out today show. In a crackdown on mediocrity, the schools watchdog Ofsted is ordering them to improve. The move follows the introduction of hard-hitting inspections to rout out poor performance. Tougher times: Thousands of British schools have been ordered to improve or face action by Ofstead . In a major speech today, Ofsted’s chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, will praise schools that strive to raise standards. But he will warn that those only doing the minimum to get by will have to raise their game or face severe sanctions. Since September 2012, all schools have been required to achieve at least a ‘good’ rating. Before then, schools were rated as outstanding, good, satisfactory or inadequate. However, the satisfactory rating was scrapped and replaced by ‘requires improvement’ to highlight continuing weaknesses. Schools are now rated on the four-point scale of outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate. Changes: In September, the satisfactory rating was scrapped and replaced by 'requires improvement' to highlight continuing weaknesses in schools . Ofsted figures released today will reveal that more than 7,000 state schools in England were inspected between September 1, 2012, and June 30 this year. Of these, almost a third – around 2,000 – fall into the ‘requires improvement’ category. They will be inspected more regularly, with Ofsted monitoring progress and checking action plans, and will be subject to a full re-inspection within two years. Schools judged to require improvement at three consecutive inspections are likely to be placed in special measures, which means they face the sacking of the head and other staff, the replacement of the governors and even the closure of the school. Schools judged ‘satisfactory’ before September last year did not automatically fall into the ‘requires improvement’ category, but they are expected to improve before their next inspection. The changed ratings also mean that to be judged ‘outstanding’, a school must have outstanding teaching. In addition, they face inspections at short notice, with the head only being notified at lunchtime the day before. Extra checks: Schools rated as ¿requires improvement¿ will be inspected more regularly and monitored by Ofsted . Speaking in Manchester, Sir Michael will insist that the overhaul is leading to improved standards across the country, with more schools moving into the ‘good’ category after rising to the challenge. The former head teacher will be addressing an audience of outstanding head teachers and urging them to share their expertise. He is expected to reiterate his view that the new inspection regime is having a ‘galvanising effect’ on head teachers and making them prioritise improvements. Earlier this year, he said: ‘Heads and governing boards have a much greater focus on tackling the central issues of school improvement.’ Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research, said yesterday: ‘Prior to the new category, we’d actually been fooling ourselves about how well our schools were doing. ‘We were marking them as satisfactory whereas this new category shows a lot of them weren’t satisfactory at all but needing improvement. Ofsted has raised the bar, so – rightly – it’s expecting more of schools. It’s giving us a clearer picture of how well schools are doing. ‘It’s bringing things which need to be addressed to our attention.’ Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, added: ‘It’s right there should be a more rigorous inspection as we obviously want the best for the children. ‘For too long, schools have been prepared to accept a satisfactory grading as a green light to coast.’ Ofsted has already introduced a tougher framework to stop weak head teachers bumping up their overall ratings by concentrating on areas such as pupil wellbeing, spiritual development and community cohesion. Since last January, schools have been judged on four key areas – teaching, pupil results, behaviour and leadership.","Ofstead orders 'mediocre' schools to improve performance .

"While it may not come as a surprise to most, patriots are outraged to learn more young Australians are able to sing the words to Daft Punk's Get Lucky chorus than both verses of Advance Australia Fair. More than 1,000 people aged 18 to 29 took part in a survey, which found 84 per cent knew all the words to the chorus of the French duo's mega hit. But in contrast and sparking the ire of patriots, just 71 per cent of the young people surveyed knew all the words of the national anthem's second verse. Scroll down for video . A study has found more young Australians are able to sing the words to Daft Punk's Get Lucky chorus than the whole national anthem . While 84 per cent of young people know the words of the Get Lucky chorus, by Daft Punk, pictured left, media personality Sam Kekovich, pictured right, said it was imperative the national anthem was sung at school, with the study finding just 71 per cent of young people know the words to the anthem's second verse . Get Lucky features U.S. singer Pharrell Williams on vocals and was one of the biggest singles of 2013 internationally and went on to win Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards last year while the online survey by Jack Daniel's focused on the music industry. Media personality and former Australian rules football player Sam Kekovich said he was not shocked by the finding of the survey, reported the Herald Sun. 'Australia needs to come front and square. It’s imperative we sing the national anthem at schools,” Mr Kekovich said. 'We need to remind young people what the national anthem is about and remembering the sacrifices that Australians have made.' Get Lucky features U.S. singer Pharrell Williams and was one of the biggest singles of 2013 . Former NSW premier Morris Iemma stated a lack of respect was behind the 2005 Cronulla riots and it was important students were taught Australian values such as respect and responsibility. On the back of this, Mr Iemma announced a plan to make it compulsory for the national anthem to be sung a school assemblies, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. The announcement was met with criticism by the NSW Teachers Federation at the time, as most schools already sang the anthem. Advance Australia Fair was written by Peter Doffs McCormick, who was born in Scotland and arrived in Sydney in 1855. Before it became Australia's national anthem, Advance Australia Fair was first performed in 1878. It was not until 1977 that today's national anthem replaced God Save the Queen, beating out other alternatives including Waltzing Matilda in a plebiscite as part of a referendum on a range of issues.","Study finds 84 per cent of young people know words of Get Lucky chorus .

"Ambulance bosses have apologised for delays in reaching a six-year-old girl who choked to death on holiday in Wales. It took 16 minutes - double the target time - for two community first responders to reach Jasmine Lapsley, who was staying with her family at a holiday home in Lon Bodlondeb, in Morfa Nefyn, North Wales. She later died in hospital. The Welsh Ambulance Service’s NHS Trust has launched an investigation into their handling of the emergency and offered their offered their 'sincere apologies.' Ambulance bosses have apologised for delays in reaching six-year-old Jasmine Lapsley (pictured) who choked to death while on holiday with her family on the Welsh Coast in August . However, Jasmine's family said they were disappointed that the ambulance service made no contact with them following her death and were unaware an inquiry was even on-going. The family from Anfield, Liverpool, praised emergency officers and local people who tried to assist Jasmine after she started choking in August. An RAF rescue helicopter, from Prince William's former HQ in Anglesey, flew her the 20 miles to hospital in Banger where she later died. Local county councillor Liz Saville Roberts, called on the Welsh Government to review response targets, particularly in rural areas, in the wake of the incident. The prospective parliamentary candidate has also raised a number of concerns with the ambulance trust. 'This terribly sad event focuses concerns about the nature of rural ambulance services, and how often ambulances are located in Pwllheli and thus on call for emergencies in the Llyn,' she said. An inquest was expected to take place into Jasmine's death later this month. 'I have spoken to Jasmine's family,' said cllr Roberts . 'Mr and Mrs Lapsley wish to praise the emergency officers and local people who gave every assistance. Jasmine Lapsley was staying with her family in a holiday home in the Welsh coastal resort of Lon Bodlondeb, in Morfa Nefyn, North Wales, (pictured) when she died . 'Nonetheless, they are disappointed that the ambulance services have made no contact since the event, and did not inform them that this inquiry was on-going.' In a letter to Cllr Roberts, Tracy Myhill, interim chief executive at the Wales Ambulance Service, said: 'I offer my most sincere apologies for the anxiety that this incident caused to Cllr Roberts and the people of the Llyn area. 'I can confirm that there is a vehicle working from the Pwllheli station 24 hours per day, seven days per week. In addition to this vehicle there is a further vehicle working from the Pwllheli station between 10am and 11pm, Monday to Saturday. 'There are three Community First Responders teams in the Llyn area.' Cllr Roberts said: 'It is appreciated that the Welsh Ambulance Services Trust has apologised for the distress caused by events surrounding Jasmine's death. Nonetheless, their delayed response - two and a half months after the tragedy - reveals no more information than was previously in the public domain. 'I call on the Welsh Government to review over-simplistic targets because the present approach is resulting in a two-tier service, dependent on whether a life-threatening emergency occurs within the eight-minute priority area or beyond the pale.' Jasmine's family said they were disappointed that the ambulance service had not made contact with them after the incident. (file picture) A spokesman for the Wales Ambulance Service said: 'The trust has reported this tragic incident to Welsh Government as a Serious Adverse Incident (SAI). SAI reports require a comprehensive and detailed investigation, and the trust endeavors to complete the investigation by mid to late-November.

"Gerardine Stockford expressed dismay on Mumsnet after finding her daughter Anna was studying the gritty drama Mogadishu ¿ which contains 218 uses of the F-word . A mother who complained about her 14-year-old daughter studying  a play containing 400 swear words has suffered a torrent of foul-mouthed abuse – from teachers. Gerardine Stockford expressed dismay on Mumsnet after finding her daughter Anna was studying the gritty drama Mogadishu – which contains 218 uses of the F-word and ten of the C-word – as part of her GCSE drama course. Mrs Stockford, 52, a former social worker, is running a petition to get the Government to put age controls on exposing pupils to swearing as her daughter had felt uncomfortable in classes at Teddington School in Richmond, West London. Former  pupils there include actors Keira Knightley and Sean Pertwee. Education Secretary Michael Gove has said he shares her concerns. But one Mumsnet user, who claimed to be a teacher, responded: ‘Censorship – that’s what you want. So you can impose your middle- England, white, middle-class values on a world that no longer exists. ‘As a teacher, I will say very bluntly how sick and f****** tired  I am of parents like you who think they are experts on all f****** areas of the curriculum.’ Another said: ‘This really, really p***** me off .  .  . I teach and have had half-***ed complaints from parents on occasion .  .  . What really boils my p*** is people having opinions about things they haven’t even read and certainly don’t understand.’ Mrs Stockford was so upset by the ‘vile’ abuse she removed the thread from Mumsnet. She said she was ‘no prude’, but was shocked by the language of the play, written by former teacher Vivienne Franzmann, about racism in a tough secondary school. She said: ‘This would not have been deemed suitable for under 18-year-olds if it was shown in a cinema, so it should not be studied by under-16s in school.’ Teddington School in Richmond, west London, said students were invited to withdraw if they felt uncomfortable, but none did so . Mr Gove said in a letter to Mrs Stockford’s MP, Vince Cable, that teachers should be trusted to decide what to teach but, ‘as a father’ he was worried about the use of a play ‘littered with extreme language and explicit references’. The Department for Education said: ‘We expect schools to alert parents before a text of this nature is taught and to give parents the option of withdrawing their children from these classes.’ Teddington School said students were invited to withdraw if they felt uncomfortable, but none did so.","Geraldine Stockford expressed her dismay on Mumsnet .

"Prince Andrew faces international censure after flying out yesterday on a secret visit to meet the controversial president of Azerbaijan. The Queen's son flew out of the UK on a private jet for talks with billionaire despot Ilham Aliyev, who has been repeatedly accused of appalling human rights abuses. It is understood that the royal will stay in the capital, Baku, until Sunday and his 'private' four-day trip includes at least one face to face meeting with the leader. When visiting Azerbaijan Andrew is known as 'the dear guest'. Close ties: Prince Andrew and Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev during one of their meetings in 2009 . His visit was not publicised in the list of official royal engagements in advance and last night Buckingham Palace would only say: 'By long standing convention we do not confirm or comment on private travel by members of the Royal Family.' However it is understood that taxpayers are not being forced to foot the bill for the jolly, aside from the cost of security. Details of the trip only emerged after a British Government source tipped off the pressure group, Platform, which campaigns against social and environmental abuses associated with the energy industry. Its spokesman, Emma Hughes, accused the prince of having a 'cosy relationship' with President Aliyev and demanded to know in what capacity he was visiting Azerbaijan. Andrew was forced to give up his globe-trotting royal role as a UK trade envoy in 2011 after years of public criticism. While his efforts were lauded by some respected names in the business community, he was also repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers' money on chartering costly private jets and helicopters - including £387,000 in his last few months in the job. Some of his business trips were also noted to coincide with golfing trips or private holidays. The prince also faced scrutiny over claims he was 'cashing in' on connections he had developed through his role including the sale of his Berkshire home for £15 million - £3million over the asking price - to the son-in-law of the controversial Kazakhstan president, a personal friend and goose hunting partner. The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire US financier who was convicted and jailed for soliciting prostitution from underage girls. The pair were photographed together in New York after Epstein had been released from prison. During his decade as the UK's Special Representative for Trade and Industry he also forged a close relationship with the President of Azerbaijan, an oil and gas-rich former Soviet state. The  Duke of York speaking at World Economic Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan, at the dinner hosted by Mr Aliyev . Officially, he has now met with him on 12 occasions, although it is believed that he has also enjoyed numerous private encounters too. In June 2009 Andrew spent an estimated £60,000 of public money on chartering a luxury private jet for a three-day visit. And in November 2012 the Mail revealed how the prince had even made a covert stop-off to visit the president en route to an official tour of the Middle East. On another earlier stay he was reported to have visited a luxury spa owned by President Aliyev, which employs a blind Russian masseur described as having the best hands in the world. And in 2013 this newspaper also revealed that Andrew had been given a valuable ornamental sword and a box of caviar by Aliyev when was guest of honour at his dinner table. The Prince is also friendly with the president's wife Mehriban, and her two glamorous daughters, one of whom, Leyla, is married to the son of a Russian oligarch and lives in a penthouse overlooking Hyde Park in London. The disclosures have added to the disquiet over the prince's relationships with the leaders of dubious regimes, as Azerbaijan is considered to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The regularity of his visits have also led media in the former Soviet state to speculate that the Queen's son may have business links to the oil-rich state, including a golf resort on the Caspian Sea. Buckingham Palace has vehemently denied this. News of his latest trip has attracted condemnation from pressure groups concerned by Azerbaijan's appalling human rights record. Aliyev, who inherited the presidency from his father, has been accused of torturing his political opponents, rigging elections and curtailing media freedom. Last October presidential elections were held in the country which saw 143 political campaigners jailed. Videos also emerged of ballot boxes allegedly being stuffed by regime supporters. Prince Andrew is not the only high profile British figure who has close links with the Aliyev regime. This August it was announced that Tony Blair is being paid to advise the Azerbaijani government and several oil companies - including BP - on the PR challenges they face in building the Euro-Caspian Mega Pipeline, a huge gas infrastructure that will run from Azerbaijan to Italy. Emma Hughes, Energy Campaigner at campaign group Platform said: 'It's shameful that both Prince Andrew and Tony Blair are so chummy with the Azerbaijani autocrat. 'There are hundreds of brave people in Azerbaijan fighting for democracy, yet our representatives are more concerned with caviar and gas deals.'","Duke of York flew by private jet to meet Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev .

"A tax on plastic bags in Wales has seen the number given away by shops fall by up to 96 per cent. The news will heap pressure on David Cameron to make good his promise to tackle the blight of plastic bags and introduce a levy in England. As well as cutting bag use, the Welsh scheme has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charities. Plastic poison: Single-use bags are a blight on the environment and harm wildlife such as this Herring Gull in Portland Dorset struggling to free itself from a white plastic carrier bag . The country has seen public support for the 5p tax rise from 59 per cent to 70 per cent since its introduction last October, according to researchers. And the programme is set to be the template for similar schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while cities and countries across the globe are pursuing similar controls. The tax’s success is a vindication of the Daily Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign, which has won support from across the political spectrum and campaign groups including the Marine Conservation Society and National Trust. A Cardiff University study into the Welsh bag charge, published yesterday, found that support for the scheme rose to 70 per cent six months after its introduction. Opposition dropped to just 17 per cent. Over the same period, the number of shoppers who said they used their own bags on their  latest supermarket visit rose from 61 per cent to 82 per cent. Banish The Bags: Most of the 13billion plastic bags given away for free in the UK end up in landfill . Figures provided to the researchers by a sample of retailers, including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury’s, the Co-operative, McDonald’s and John Lewis, revealed a big reduction in bag numbers. Supermarkets reported a drop of up to 96 per cent, while numbers were down 95 per cent at DIY warehouses, 85 per cent at mobile phone shops, 75 per cent in clothing stores and 45 per cent at fast food outlets. But despite these encouraging Welsh statistics, official figures published today are expected to show the number of bags handed out by major stores has increased by at least 350million in a year. The Prime Minister repeatededly promised both before and after the general election to tackle the blight associated with plastic bags. It is understood that the idea of introducing a charge in England has the support of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but the Chancellor George Osborne and the Treasury have – to date – blocked it. The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We do want to work with retailers to see if we can reduce the number of bags they hand out. We are looking at the results of the scheme in Wales and the Scottish consultation. ‘Defra has been having meetings with retailers to discover how we can achieve that [reduction].’ Blight on the landscape: Plastic bags often litter the streets such as this one near Preston in Lancashire . A source close to Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman added: ‘All options are on the table. ‘The Welsh scheme seems to have had a downward pressure on the use of plastic bags. We appreciate the positive effects that has had but there is an issue that any extra cost, however small, at a time when people are short is difficult. We are keen to encourage the use of bags for life, particularly light cotton ones.’ The Welsh study found women and older people were particularly supportive of the bag charge. Consumers were also keen on the idea that money raised by the levy goes to charities, rather than the government. The research team concluded: ‘This evaluation of the behavioural and attitudinal impacts of the introduction of the single-use carrier bag charge in Wales has shown that the policy is popular and effective. ‘The charge has helped to greatly increase own-bag use in Wales across all age groups and for men and women alike.’","Wales introduced 5p tax on bags in October last year .

"Parents have complained after a BBC error showed a musician in a Womble suit remove its head during a live broadcast shattering the illusion that the furry creates exist. The mistake was made during a live video stream on Simon Mayo's Drivetime radio show on Tuesday when Womble Orinoco whipped off his head as the webcam was still running. Parents from all over the UK had tuned in with their youngsters to watch The Wombles appear exclusively on the Radio Two website and perform two songs, including Christmas number one hopeful Wombling Merry Christmas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Whoops! The mistake was made during a live video stream on Simon Mayo's Drivetime radio show on Tuesday when Womble Orinoco whipped off his head as the webcam was still running . But as an interview with Simon Mayo came to a close, Orinico, played by songwriter Mike Batt, removed his head, leaving children 'horrified' that the Wombles were not real. The BBC have now removed a link to the live feed from its website leaving just two songs and an interview with Simon Mayo left to view. Mr Batt, who invented The Wombles pop group in the 70s, apologised on Twitter, but blamed BBC staff for telling him he was 'no longer on air' and so could safely remove his costume. After being told that hundreds of children has seen he was inside the Womble, the 62-year-old musician and Womble tweeted: 'On no - they told us we were off air!!!!' Not impressed: Peter McFarland, son Dylan and wife Vickie had been looking forward to the show all day and were horrified when Orinoco took his head off . This morning Mr Batt posted an explanation for the incident on his blog, assuring children wombles were 'very real indeed' adding: 'Everybody knows a Womble can't take his head off.' He told the children he stepped in at the last minute posing as Orinoco who was feeling unwell in the heat of the studio. Mr Batt, who invented The Wombles pop group in the 70s, apologised on Twitter . He wrote: 'Luckily, I carry a fancy dress Womble costume with me to all Womble appearances, so if the real Orinoco is too puffed out (because he is the fat one, and hardly does any exercise) I can run in, like a substitute in a football match) and take over, - which is what I did. 'We managed to get the real Orinoco off, during a cut in the camera coverage, and he was given oxygen and some nettle tea.' He also said that he was meant to be . given a two minute break in-between singing the songs and being . interviewed by Simon Mayo, saying it was 'very hot' in the costume. He . said: 'I told them (the BBC) that I needed a break after the songs (as . it) was a high heat effort - they were supposed to give me a two minute . break!' Parents from around the UK said the . 'damage had already been done' and that they had been forced to come up . with 'all kinds of explanations' about why there was a human inside a . Womble.

Father-of-four Peter McFarland, 34, of Shrewsbury, said he and six-year-old son Dylan had been looking forward to the show all day and that his son was horrified when he saw Orinoco take his head off. Artist Mr McFarland said: 'I'm very very angry - we were watching the Radio Two live footage of the Wombles and at the end of the interview Orinoco pulled his head off before the cameras stopped rolling to reveal Mike Batt instead.

'I . thought it might have been too brief for Dylan to have noticed as he . went totally silent and we thought we might have got away with it, but . then he said 'All Wombles are fake' and asked to go to Wimbledon Common . to meet the real ones.

He added: 'One very angry email getting sent to the BBC now.' Mother . Vickie McFarland, 36, said: 'The Wombles have lost my support - 'My six . year old son is heartbroken and now he doesn't believe the Wombles are . real. 'Way to go breaking a little boy's heart and ruining Christmas for him.' Another . mother, Christine Furniss, 43, of Stoke, said she had to explain to her . two boys, Oscar, five, and Toby, seven, that Wombles were 'not real' after the error. She said: 'They both looked at me for an explanation when Orinoco's head came off - what could I tell them? 'I had to tell them the truth and it's fair to say they were devastated. 'All . of their friends were watching it at home too as it was a chance to see . the Wombles perform the Christmas song - so a lot of children were left . very, very upset about what happened.'

The full video stream is no longer available to view after BBC chiefs cut it into three segments - none of which show Orinico's head being removed. A spokesman for the BBC admitted that the Womble was not meant to remove his head until after the cameras had stopped rolling, but blamed Orinoco for the bungle. She said: 'The Wombles played a festive set for Radio 2 which was filmed for live online streaming. 'The Wombles were aware they were being filmed, but he (Mike Batt) just took his head off.

"Ed Miliband yesterday rounded on the ‘powerful forces’ and ‘vested interests’ he believes are plotting to stop him entering Downing Street. In a highly charged speech designed to draw a line under weeks of turmoil in Labour ranks, Mr Miliband risked accusations of paranoia as he insisted: ‘When powerful forces try to tell me “no way”, I answer: “who says?” ‘I’m willing to put up with whatever is thrown at me.’ Mr Miliband’s speech in London amounted to a passionate defence of his ability to lead his party and the country after some discontented Labour MPs suggested privately he should be replaced. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband accuses Ukip of wanting to return Britain to a more unequal, more unjust past . The Labour leader’s personal ratings this week plunged to a record low – below even those of Michael Foot, the party’s least successful leader – and one poll put the Conservatives three points ahead. Although only 13 per cent of people think he is up to being prime minister, Mr Miliband insisted he had the ‘resilience’ and ‘thick skin’ to do the job. He promised to talk more about the issue of immigration – which he forgot to mention in his disastrous party conference speech, along with the deficit – and attacked firms for ‘exploiting’ cheap migrant labour to undercut wages of British workers. He also launched a fierce attack on Ukip, which has eaten into Labour’s core working-class vote in some areas, suggesting the party was prejudiced against working women, foreigners and gays and lesbians. Mr Miliband pledged to tackle a ‘zero-zero economy’, saying many ordinary workers were on so-called zero-hours contracts while the rich ‘get away with zero tax’. Mr Miliband delivered his speech to Labour activists at Senate House at the University of London, hitting back at his critics . Mr Miliband suggested establishment enemies were ranged against him, while the Tories 'think that Britain does best when the most powerful do best' Mr Miliband insisted he has the resilience to win the election, as he took aim at vested interests he blames for opposing his plan for change . Senior Labour figures insisted last night that ‘Hell would freeze over’ before they joined forces with Nigel Farage after the election. On Wednesday, the Ukip leader said he would be prepared to prop up a Labour government if Ed Miliband failed to win a majority and Ukip secured about ten seats. Mr Farage said he would ‘do a deal with the Devil’ if it ‘got me what I wanted’ – apparently a reference to his demand for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union . Last night a senior Labour figure dismissed the idea, saying ‘Hell would freeze over’ before Labour did a deal with Ukip. ‘The Tories have no answers to the discontent people feel,’ he said. ‘Ukip have wildly wrong answers to that discontent. And who knows what one can say about the Liberal Democrats?’ Quoting a phrase used by Tony Blair in his farewell conference speech in 2006, he insisted: ‘Friends, I say we can take this lot apart – and it is time we did.’ Mr Miliband added: ‘No vested interest, whoever they are and however powerful they are, from banks to energy companies, should ever be able to hold our country back.’ Aides suggest a shadowy network of City institutions, energy companies, media magnates, payday lenders and hedge funds is determined to stop him winning power. They insisted Mr Miliband did not blame them for his recent difficulties, but he was determined to confront powerful establishment figures. Ed Miliband's net satisfaction ratings have slumped 10 points to -44, the worst for any main party leader six months before a general election, according to IpsosMORI data dating back to the 1970s . The Conservatives have pulled into a three-point lead, their biggest margin over Labour since 2010 . Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, touted as a potential leader, said Mr Miliband was prepared to ‘stand up for ordinary people against vested interests’. ‘That is what has defined his leadership of the Labour Party, against energy companies... against the banks, and yes, against parts of the media,’ he said. ‘And for those reasons there are people out there who don’t want him to win.’ Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Ed Miliband and those in his bunker may have convinced themselves his difficulties are all the result of some sort of conspiracy. But the truth is, it’s the voters he has the real problem with.’ A Tory source added: ‘I’m surprised Ed Miliband wasn’t wearing a tin-foil hat today. His conspiracy theories are out of control.’ Mr Farage last night responded to Mr Miliband’s attacks by challenging him to a live TV debate, telling the Labour leader: ‘Come and have a go.’ THOSE 'VESTED INTERESTS' CLAIM: No vested interest, whoever they are and however powerful they are... should ever be able to hold our country back. Between now and the election they are going to use every tactic to try to destabilise, distract us and throw us off course. ' REALITY: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham says these ‘vested interests’ include the Right-wing media – accused by Labour of concocting stories of a leadership crisis. In fact, the turmoil was triggered by a savage attack on Mr Miliband by the Left-wing New Statesman magazine, which labelled him an ‘old-style Hampstead socialist’; and the Left-leaning BBC, which reported that Labour backbench MPs had called for him to quit. It was fuelled by The Observer, which claimed 20 Shadow Cabinet members were on the brink of calling for Mr Miliband to step down. IS LABOUR DISUNITED? CLAIM: We haven’t had the best couple of weeks. Disunited parties are parties that the public worries about and I understand that. REALITY: So which is it – is the Labour Party disunited, as he appears to concede, or is it all a great conspiracy by the media and the shadowy ‘vested interests’? His remarks are certainly a sharp U-turn on last week, when he claimed there was no discontent in the Labour ranks. Last Thursday, he told the BBC: ‘I don’t accept that this matter [concern over his leadership] arises. Honestly, this is nonsense.’ THE 'ZERO-ZERO ECONOMY' CLAIM: People are asking why they are on zero-hours contracts while some of those at the top get away with paying zero tax. The zero-zero economy, we need to change. REALITY: Not only is the zero-zero economy an ugly, wonkish soundbite – it’s disingenuous. There is no legal way for a high-earning individual in Britain to pay no tax unless they have donated all their earnings to charity. The people in Britain who pay no income tax are people whose salary is less than £10,000 (many of whom will be on zero-hours contracts). It took the Tory/Lib Dem Coalition to raise the threshold for the personal tax allowances . IMMIGRATION U-TURN . CLAIM: It isn’t prejudiced to worry about the effects of immigration. It is because of the real impacts it has. REALITY: Only last month, Labour led criticism of Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon when he warned communities feel ‘swamped’ by mass immigration – despite it being a view shared by Labour’s own ex-home secretary, David Blunkett. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander accused Mr Fallon of not being ‘responsible’. Labour continues to resist any changes to EU free movement.","Labour leader uses make or break speech to get leadership back on track .

"A daughter who went missing from her parents 37 years ago after catching the wrong train has had an astonishing reunion with her mother. Jiang Ai-wu - now 43 - was just six when she got lost in her home town in Hunan province, south-central China, and tried to make her way home by train from the local station. Her story echoes that of Australian Saroo Brierley, who was only reunited with his birth mother 25 years after he got lost on India's sprawling rail network aged four. Scroll down for video . Tears: Jiang Ai-wu, left, is reunited with her mother Ju Yeh, 37 years after she got lost on a train in Hunan . Emotional: Family crowd around as the reunited mother and daughter sob into each other's arms . 'I had no idea where I was going and one wrong train led to another, and another and another. The harder I tried to get home, the further away I seemed to go,' said Ai-wu at the tearful reunion. The frightened child ended up 450 miles away in Xuzhou, a city in Jiangsu province in eastern China, where she was taken into care by the authorities. 'I always wanted to find my own family, I dreamed of it, but I was so young I didn't know how to find them. I didn't even know our address. 'Gradually I had to concentrate on the life I had but I never gave up hoping that one day, my mother and father would come and get me.' Meanwhile, her frantic parents kept up the search for their daughter. Ju Yeh, her mother said: 'She had gone on a small errand but never came home. We were desperate. We went to the police, searched the city, went to all the train and bus stations but we couldn't find her. 'We didn't know what to think had happened but in my heart I never forgot my little girl and sent a prayer to her every night.' Together: Jiang Ai-wu's parents and relatives pose for a family photo that's been 37 years in the making . The family were finally reunited when Ai-wu's daughter, Mei, contacted a missing persons website and spent nearly a year tracking down her relatives. Her persistence paid off, even though the family had moved north to Shanxi province. Yeh, now 70, said: 'I couldn't believe it when I received a phone call one day asking me if I'd ever had a daughter who'd got lost. 'Then my little Ai-wu came on the line and it was as if she'd never been away.' Ai-wu added: 'We have a lot of catching up to do - I have a huge new family to get used to now.'","Jiang Ai-wu was just six when she got lost from her home in Hunan province .

"Warren Buffett's cash-laden investment house Berkshire Hathaway announced Thursday the purchase of battery maker Duracell in a $4.7 billion deal with Procter & Gamble. Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. Berkshire Hathaway said it will pay the US consumer goods giant for Duracell with $4.7 billion of its own P&G shares. Ahead of that transaction, though, P&G has committed to inject $1.8 billion into Duracell to recapitalize it. Billionaire Warren Buffett, CEO: P&G will receive shares of its own stock that are currently held by Berkshire Hathaway. Those shares are currently valued at about $4.7 billion . Duracell is one of the world's leading battery brands, acquired by P&G in 2005 as part of its takeover of shaving goods group Gillette. The company reportedly has 25 percent of the global battery market with $2 billion in annual sales, producing from three factories in the United States, one in Belgium and one in China. 'I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,' Berkshire founder and chief executive Buffett said in a statement. 'Duracell is a leading global brand with top quality products, and it will fit well within Berkshire Hathaway.' The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers. Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week. Final deal: Proctor & Gamble will contribute about $1.7 billion to the Duracell business before the deal closes . Buying Duracell is a 'brilliant move,' said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short. 'Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,' Kass added. 'And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.' Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30. Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup. Smart business deal: Billionaire Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett is buying the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co. in a deal valued at approximately $3 billion . 'I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,' Buffett said in a statement. Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources. 'It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,' Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. 'I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.' Last week Berkshire, which maintains a massive portfolio of investments in leading companies from insurer Geico to ketchup maker Heinz and executive jet firm NetJets, reported a $107 million fall in third quarter net profits to $4.62 billion despite a 29 percent rise in operating earnings. In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87.","Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate that owns insurance, railroad, retailers and other businesses, said it expects the deal to close by the end of 2015 .

"Fast food litter has hit record levels - and experts are blaming poorly-designed council bins. Posting junk into narrow 'hatches' puts people off their lunch and means they throw their cartons on the street instead, said a government-backed report. Instead councils should be using more bins with wide open rims so people know where they are putting their hands. Rubbish design: Bins with narrow hatches put people off throwing away their junk properly, says a report . 'People don't like to use bins that look full or dirty,' the report said. 'This is because people don't want to touch rubbish inside the bin and don't want to touch a dirty bin' - and ones with small hatches are worse . Campaign group Keep Britain Tidy revealed the criticism in its annual report on litter funded by the government. It found fast food packages including napkins, plastic forks, cartons and salt sachets have shot up in the last decade, from 19 per cent of sites surveyed to 31 per cent. They are now the fourth most common type of litter after smoking materials, sweet wrappers and drink cartons. The report said there was more litter in areas with bins than in those without. 'Where a bin has been provided, it is not always being used,' the report said. 'This could be down to bin design, bin capacity, the bin's location or the frequency with which it is emptied. 'People don't like to use bins that look full or dirty. This is because people don't want to touch rubbish inside the bin and don't want to touch a dirty bin. Rise: The report said the amount of litter from fast food has risen sharply in the last ten years to a record high . Missed! Fast food waste has risen from 19 per cent of all sites a decade ago to 31 per cent of sites now . 'Bins can become dirty from food and drink staining, chewing gum being stuck to them, and general dirt and grime building up over time. 'Sites with clean bins had significantly less fast food-related litter on the ground compared to sites with dirty bins, which indicates that the cleanliness of a bin has an impact on whether people will use it.' It added: 'Our work with local authorities suggests that bins with a large opening and the ability to drop rubbish into them, rather than post the rubbish through a narrow opening, are preferable to users.' But the report noted open-topped bins were not always the best answer as they encourage pests. The Local Environmental Quality Survey of England was carried out by Keep Britain Tidy on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Worst offenders: Cigarette butts are still the biggest blight followed by sweet wrappers and drink cartons . Surveys were carried out at 7,200 sites in 45 English council areas between April 2013 and March 2014. The survey looked at seven measures - cleanliness, detritus, weed growth, staining, graffiti, fly-posting and recent leaf and blossom fall. Cigarette butts and empty packets remained by far the biggest blight on England's streets - found at almost three quarters of all sites surveyed. But conditions were far worse in poor areas - 28 per cent of which were 'unacceptable' - than wealthy ones, where the figure was just 3 per cent. Poorest areas had an average of 13 cigarette butts at each site while wealthiest ones had three, and dog mess dropped similarly from 14 per cent to 6 per cent. Keep Britain Tidy chief executive Phil Barton warned towns are suffering because of government cuts - but insisted people cannot rely on the state to clear up their mess. Getting worse: The report said there was evidence that cuts to council budgets were having an impact . Deprivation: The poorest areas had the most cigarette butts, litter and dog mess, according to the report . 'Cuts to local authority budgets continue and some indicators suggest that cleansing is beginning to suffer as a consequence,' he said. 'We cannot afford to be complacent. If we want to keep our country clean and litter-free we cannot and must not rely on councils' capacity to ""clean up after us"". 'The large amount of public money we spend to keep England clean is unacceptable and a bill that we should not have to keep paying.' Of the nine English regions the West Midlands was the cleanest, and the North West and Greater London were the dirtiest - partly because they had the most densely-packed residents. Liberal Democrat environment minister Dan Rogerson said: 'The increase in the prevalence of fast food-related litter over the past ten years is disappointing - packaging and litter associated with eating and drinking accounted for six of the ten most commonly littered items.' He added: 'It is sad to see the correlation between poor local environment quality and deprivation. 'Some of the most disadvantaged members of our society also tend to have reduced access to the benefits to physical and mental health associated with high quality, clean, and safe public spaces . 'At the same time, the evidence shows that poor levels of local environment quality are associated with increases in other low-level crime and social disorder, further compounding problems for the local community.'","Fast food litter jumped from affecting 19% to 31% of sites in a decade .

"Samuel Henley, a maths teacher at Gordonstoun - where Prince Charles used to go to school - will learn whether he will be banned from teaching today after he admitted making child pornography . A maths teacher at a boarding school is due to learn whether he will be barred from teaching today after he admitted having child pornography on his computer. Samuel Henley taught at Gordonstoun school in Moray in Scotland, a £32,000 a year independent school which counts Prince Charles and other members of the Royal Family among its alumni. Henley escaped prison after he admitted six charges of making indecent images of children. A hearing today will determine whether he will be deemed fit to teach again or if he will be struck off the register. The 32-year-old was sacked from Gordonstoun after images of naked boys as young as eight engaging in sexual acts were discovered on his computer. One of the pictures was headlined 'sweet boys kissing' and included images of 10 to 12-year-old boys engaging in sexual activity. There were also videos on the computer of young teenage boys performing sex acts on one another. None of the children involved are believed to have been students at the 600-pupil Scottish campus. The images were found at a computer at his parents' home in July 2010. Henley pleaded guilty on the day he was due to stand trial for 30 charges of making indecent images of children. He admitted six charges and 24 were left to lie on file. At a previous hearing at Chester Crown Court Judge Elgan Edwards told Henley, who had no previous convictions that the offences were not serious enough to send him to prison . Today the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) will decide whether the maths teacher should be allowed to return to the classroom. The charges from the council say he is 'unfit to teach' due to his convictions 'making indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of a child'. Henley's case is listed for a full hearing at the GTCS today, and started at 10am this morning. The independent Gordonstoun School in Elgin in Scotland sits in 200 acres and costs £32,000 a year in fees . His career is believed to be in ruins since the incident came to light and Henley is understood to be working alongside his teacher in a shop. Police were tipped off to search his parents' home by officers in the Netherlands who were investigating paedophiles distributing images on a file sharing website. Henley, who taught at Gordonstoun from 2009 and was sentenced to a two year conditional discharge in February. He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for the next five years.

Prince Edward (right) is also a former pupil and was head boy at Gordonstoun in 1982 . Prince Philip (left) dressed in costume for a production of Macbeth at Gordonstoun school in July 1935 . Henley is also the subject of a sex offenders prevention order, which means he is disqualified from working with children for the foreseeable future. Prince Charles is the most famous of Gordonstoun's alumni and has previously said he hated his time at the boarding school, claiming he was bullied. He also said he was subjected to a cruel initiation ceremony involving being caged naked and put under a cold shower. Gordonstoun was founded in 1934 by Dr Kurt Hahn . Dr Hahn had fled Germany in 1933 and initially started a school with three pupils . The next year pupil numbers increased and he signed a lease with the Gordon-Cumming family for the Gordonstoun estate . Today the school sits in 200 acres and has primary and secondary facilities . It is one of the last remaining full boarding schools, and houses 600 male and female pupils . Prince Charles was a pupil at the school in the 1960s . Other royal alumni include Prince Edward, who was head boy in 1982, and Zara Phillips . Prince Andrew went to the school in the 1970s and became known for his hockey skills . Prince Philip also went to Gordonstoun in the 1930s . Prince Andrew is pictured with the Queen and Prince Philip on his arrival at Gordonstoun School in Elgin .

"A tiger hunt is underway near Paris today following reports of a wild beast roaming around a supermarket car park. Police marksmen supported by a helicopter were scrambled after residents said they saw the animal in France’s Seine-et-Marne department, to the east of the capital. French authorities told residents to remain indoors as emergency services search for the tiger in an area approximately five miles from the Disneyland Paris theme park. Scroll down for video . Tiger: The beast was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where this grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken . After staring directly into the camera the 'tiger' calmly turns away and wanders off into nearby farmland . A paw print of what was described as a tiger by police animal brigade oficer is pictured in Montevrain . ‘The alleged tiger is being tracked, but we are trying to intercept it,’ a local police spokesman said. He added that special officers trained in using tranquilizers were involved, and that the aim was to capture the beast alive. One wildlife expert said: ‘We’re going to try and sedate it, but if it becomes dangerous or aggressive, we’ll give the order to kill it.’ A policeman stands guard as officers and firefighters continue to search for a tiger, which is on the loose near Paris . Members of the police animal brigade check a wooded area as they attempt to track down the young tiger . The local council has urged residents in the area to stay indoors while the search for the 'giant cat' Meanwhile a local council spokesman in Montevrain said: 'We urge caution and please do not walk around the area behind the tennis courts and football pitches, which have been cordoned off since this morning. ‘We will keep you updated of all events. We repeat - do not walk around, and take your car instead'. It was first spotted near the village of Montevrain, where a grainy picture of a cat-like animal was taken. Police say the aim of the search operation is to capture the tiger alive, with officers used in the hunt specialised in using tranquillizers . Hunt: Police marksmen supported by a helicopter were scrambled after residents said they saw the animal in France’s Seine-et-Marne department, to the east of the capital . Members of the police animal brigade walk through the streets of Montevrain looking for the tiger . Jean-Baptiste Berdeaux, who manages the Intermarche supermarket told reporters: ‘My wife saw it this morning. She didn't get out of the car and called me to say “I think I saw a lynx”.’ There was a circus in the village earlier this month, but all its animals, including tigers, are now accounted for. ‘There is no question of a tiger having escaped from this circus, which was very well regulated,’ said a town council spokesman. Officers trained in using tranquilizers are involved in the search, and their aim is to capture the animal alive . A spokesman for EuroDisney said the animal was nothing to do with them, as they do not keep live tigers. Others have pointed out the Parc des Félins big cat park in Lumigny Nesle-Ormeaux – 18 miles away from Montévrain – as a more likely source. The tiger is the largest species of cat and – beyond zoos and circuses – there are no known communities in Europe.

"Britain and the West must brace themselves for more bloody atrocities before Islamist jihadists in Iraq  are defeated, former top brass said  last night. Retired commanders issued the chilling warning as they urged David Cameron to deploy more RAF warplanes to fight Islamic State fanatics. The ex-military chiefs also suggested stepping up Special Forces operations to ‘spoil the day’ of the fanatics, including British Muslims, who have swept across northern Iraq. Recruiters: British jihadis Reyaad Khan, Nasser Muthana and Abdul Raqib Amin are seen in an IS video released earlier this year. In the video, the trio encourage other Britons to join them . Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, a former head of the RAF, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, called for Britain to ramp up military options in Iraq. They spoke out after gruesome images were published on the internet of a jihadist, with a British accent, murdering US journalist James Foley – claiming it was in revenge for US air strikes. As Mr Cameron condemned the ‘brutal and barbaric murder’, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said British troops could be sent to Baghdad to help train Iraqi soldiers to counter the growing threat. So far the UK has deployed an RAF  Rivet Joint spy plane – a flying ‘listening post’ that picks up chatter made over mobile  phones or radios – and six Tornado fighter jets fitted with state-of-the-art surveillance equipment that beam real-time images of targets  to commanders. The aim is to gather vast amounts of crucial intelligence, including on militants’ manoeuvres, to support humanitarian efforts – but this could be used to support US bombers in strike missions to oust Islamic State. But Sir Michael, who served as Chief of the Air Staff from 1992 to 1997, warned the West must be prepared for jihadists taking retribution against other hostages as they were pounded by air strikes. Referring to Mr Foley’s murder, he said: ‘Being blunt, we sadly must expect more of this. We are dealing with fanatical, religious people who are long past the point of normal behaviour. They must be stopped.’ Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, a former head of the RAF, and Air Commodore Andrew Lambert, a former air defence chief who commanded forces in Iraq, called for Britain to ramp up military options in Iraq. They spoke out after a jihadist, with a British accent, murdered US journalist James Foley - claiming it was in revenge for US air strikes . He said the West should continue ‘evening the game up’ by supplying weapons, mortars and rockets to the Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers, who are fighting IS. ‘The jihadists have got their hands on artillery and weapons looted from the Iraqi army, which has given them a huge advantage. We should now be arming the Peshmerga to even up the playing field.’ Sending more RAF reconnaissance planes to the troubled region ‘will always be useful’ in building up an intelligence picture of the fanatics. Sir Michael said UK Special Forces on the ground could be deployed on top-secret operations to inflict huge damage on advancing extremists. ‘What I think they can do, if they are working closely with the Peshmerga, and I’m sure they are, is conduct missions which require the jihadists to mass [in an area] and the moment they mass, you have got a target. Then you can send in bombers and do things to them that really spoil their day.’ Air Commodore Lambert, who commanded Allied forces in enforcing a no-fly zone over northern Iraq in 1999, said he believed Britain should put on a greater show of military strength to deter the jihadists. In responce to the shocking footage of Foley's beheading, which was titled 'A Message to U.S.', British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond to vow Britain would 'oppose ISIS with every breath in our body' He said: ‘If you want me to make one criticism, it’s this: the scale of the operation is probably too small. When we had the no-fly zone, there were 50 or 60 aircraft. Symbolically it quite often is useful to give messages to people that if you have a robust package then people take you more seriously that you know what is going on.’ He said deploying more RAF planes with reconnaissance equipment would allow ‘continuous coverage’ of the battlefield, compared to only a few hours that the RAF can do at present. Air Commodore Lambert added: ‘Obviously, if the threat increases then I would expect the UK and US to increase the number of assets there.’ One of the British jihadists in the region, Nasser Muthana, is a 20-year-old former Cardiff schoolboy who featured prominently in Islamic State’s first professionally produced English-language propaganda video, which urged young Muslims in the West to join the terror group. Yesterday, Muthana mocked US efforts to defend Iraq’s Yazidi minority from genocide at the hands of IS militants, saying on Twitter they ‘can’t even protect their own citizens’. The young jihadist, who describes himself on Twitter as a ‘soldier of the Islamic State’, said last month the UK government should be ‘afraid’ of his bomb-making skills. Muthana has been joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17. The brothers, who grew up in Cardiff after their father moved there from Yemen as a teenager, are among hundreds of young Britons who have travelled to Syria to join the rebels. British Muslims must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them, Islamic community leaders said yesterday. In the wake of US journalist James Foley’s brutal murder, they urged imams and mosques to do more to combat extremists – even if it means risking reprisals. Some imams have already made repeated appeals to radicalised youngsters not to join militants in the Middle East. The Muslim Council of Britain has urged Islamic communities to unite and tell the jihadists: ‘Not in our name.’ British Muslims must be stronger in their condemnation of jihadists and the hate preachers who recruit them, Islamic community leaders said yesterday. Including Dr Taj Hargey, director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford . But critics have unfavourably compared the recent appeals, via open letters and YouTube videos, with the thousands-strong marches organised to protest Israel’s military action against Gaza, or the publication of a  cartoon of Mohammed in a Danish magazine. Dr Taj Hargey, director of the Muslim Educational Centre of Oxford, said: ‘This grotesque murder characterises Muslims as barbaric savages. If this senseless killing doesn’t change people’s attitudes, what will? ‘In the UK the majority of the Muslim population are Sunni and the Sunni group has been remarkably silent about what is happening in Iraq. The time has now come for a mass outcry from mainstream Muslims, not only about this murder but also the persecution of the Iraqi Yazidis and Christians and the killing of other Muslims.’ Abu Muntasir, chief executive of the Muslim educational charity JIMAS, added that some religious leaders had been too slow to condemn the Islamic State terrorists due to fear of reprisals from extremists in Britain. He admitted: ‘In the past I have been more careful and shown restraint but enough is enough. ‘I’m prepared to take more risks to defy these evil people. I utterly condemn IS even if it puts me at personal risk, at danger of people coming to my home. I’m no longer prepared to be muted.’ He called on the Government to take tougher action against jihadists who travelled to Iraq or Syria to fight – despite having supported jihad himself in the past. The married father of 12 said he fought the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan, but now believed fighters were driven by aggression, not religious devotion. He told the Daily Mail: ‘They seek guns and violence. It is not about jihad or religion, it is all pure escapism and adventure.’ Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of Manchester’s Ramadhan Foundation, said Britain would be at risk of terror attacks if radicalised fighters are allowed to return. He spoke out against IS, formerly known as ISIS, saying: ‘I utterly condemn the senseless and barbaric killing of James Foley by the terrorist group ISIS. ‘If this barbaric killing was not enough then the allegation that the beheading was carried out by a British citizen is deeply worrying for our nation.’ The Muslim Council of Britain released a statement saying: ‘Each day ISIS seeks to carry out an act more barbarous than the day before, craving the oxygen of publicity to give credibility to their heinous acts. ‘We condemn unreservedly their psychopathic violence, whether it is on minorities, on civilians or on fellow Muslims.’","Ex-military chiefs suggested .

"Straggly beards, duck calls and catching frogs aren't the first things that come to mind when you think of musicals - but that's not stopping the Robertsons. The Duck Dynasty stars are working with Broadway producers on a 90-minute production about their 'rags to riches' story, which will open at in Las Vegas in February, the New York Times reported. But already several Broadway producers have expressed their shock that colleagues would work with the family after its patriarch, Phil Robertson, made remarks comparing homosexuality to bestiality. Jeff Calhoun, the director of 'The Duck Commander Family Musical', is himself gay but said they had already started working on the musical when Robertson made the comments to GQ last year. Growing empire: The Robertson family, who star in 'Duck Dynasty', are now working with Broadway producers on a musical about their 'rags to riches' story, which will open at a casino in Las Vegas next year . Calhoun, who also directed 'Newsies' on Broadway, decided to press ahead with the project anyway. He told the newspaper that his husband's family share similar outlooks to the Robertsons. 'We've agreed to disagree on some things, but we're family and we love and respect each other,' he said. 'I like to think that this musical could bridge some gaps, too.' He added that rather than shying away from the issue, they would be addressing the remarks in the musical - although the team said it is still working out how to do so. The show, which will open at the Rio hotel and casino, will feature actors playing the members of the Robertson family, who own a multi-millionaire duck call business in Louisiana. Controversial: The show was briefly suspended last year after patriarch Phil Robertson made homophobic remarks comparing homosexuality to bestiality. Despite repeating the remarks, the show is still on air . Not backing down: Jeff Calhoun, the director of Broadway's 'Newsies', is directing the Duck Dynasty show. Calhoun, who is gay, said that he intended to address Robertson's remarks in the show . The musical might also feature video of the real family and duck hunting, as well as a 14 songs mixing country, blues and show tunes, the Times reported. An opening number might be entitled, 'Faith, Food and Family'. The show is based upon a book Willie Robertson, a star of the show and one of Phil Robertson's sons, wrote in 2012 with his wife. 'We've enjoyed the process of making a musical alongside the team who is interested in telling the Robertson family story from an outside perspective,' he said. Michael David, a Broadway producer behind the show, said that the musical will challenge audiences more than other productions on stage. 'The Robertsons are so unusual, their story so juicy, and theater shouldn't be limited to telling stories about people you resemble or revere,' he said. Showtime: The musical will open at the Rio Hotel & Casino, where the Chippendales perform, in February . David, who also produced the 'Jersey Boys' for Las Vegas, said that he also believes Duck Dynasty could enjoy similar success, although there is no plan to take it to Broadway yet. The family have starred in Duck Dynasty since 2012 and their seventh season starts next week. The show has had as many as 11 million viewers, although numbers dropped after the recent scandal. 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview last year. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there. 'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.' Despite A&E briefly dropping him from the show, he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views and has been filmed defending them on multiple occasions since.","The Robertson family are working on 'The Duck Commander Family Musical' with Broadway producers .

"An . Oklahoma missionary who is accused of raping and molesting ten children . at the Kenyan orphanage where he was working claims he was possessed by . a demon named Luke, federal prosecutors say. In . text messages released in court documents, 19-year-old Matthew Lane . Durham talked to a friend about his supposed alter-ego: 'Literally he . takes me at night and there is nothing I can do to stop him. '... I've prayed so much, but every night Luke gets what Luke wants.' Prosecutors have alleged that Durham of . Edmond engaged in sex acts with as many as ten children aged 4 to 10 . - including one who is HIV positive - while volunteering at the Upendo Children's Home near Nairobi from April . to June 2014. Accused: . Matthew Lane Durham faces federal charges in his native Oklahoma that . he molested up to ten children at a Kenyan orphanage. He allegedly . confessed to the abuse . Prosecutors . submitted these text messages Durham allegedly sent to a friend as . evidence that he remains a danger to the community . 'I . took her to the bathroom and forced her to have sex with me. This has . happened on more than one occasion.' This is one of the horrific . confessions that Durham allegedly wrote out . He faces up to life in prison if convicted of engaging in illegal sexual conduct in foreign places, aggravated sexual abuse with children and other charges. The indictment alleges that Durham traveled from Oklahoma City to Kenya in order to engage in illicit sexual conduct with children at Upendo, which specializes in assisting neglected Kenyan children by providing them with food, housing, clothes and academic and religious instruction. The indictment also accuses Durham of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors under 18 years of age and aggravated sexual abuse of a child under 12. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, Bob Troester, said Durham could be asked to enter a plea to the charges as early as Wednesday. Durham's attorney, Stephen Jones, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. Melissa . and Kyle Durham, the parents of Matthew Durham, say they don't believe . the allegations that their son molested ten children in Kenya . Jones, who has defended the likes of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy . McVeigh, previously said the confession was the result of 'some sort of . pseudo-tribal psychological voodoo.' In . text message to a friend - which prosecutors submitted as evidence - . Durham wrote: 'It takes me at night and I am powerless to what Luke . wants. Yes I named him, I know how crazy that is. 'He whispers in my ear all day and he's so hard to resist.' The indictment was returned as a federal judge weighs whether to release Durham to his family's home in Edmond while the charges against him are litigated. Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. District judge David Russell ordered Durham temporarily detained while prosecutors appeal an order granting his release on bond. A U.S. magistrate granted bond on Monday. Durham faces up to life in prison if convicted of engaging in illegal sexual conduct in foreign places, aggravated sexual abuse with children and other charge . Russell has not indicated when he might hand down a ruling on the issue and it was not immediately clear if the indictment will affect his decision. Prosecutors have urged the judge to detain Durham and allege he is a danger to the community and could flee if released on bond. ‘The defendant in this matter by his own detailed admission both orally and in writing has brutally raped and molested young girls and boys in an orphanage in Kenya,’ the appeal filed in U.S. District Court alleges. ‘He has confessed his crimes in writing, on video, and has admitted to a life-long struggle of desires to touch children and “child predation,”’ it says. An affidavit filed in federal court said Durham, who has volunteered with the children' home since June 2012, wrote and signed a statement acknowledging the sexual misconduct. An Upendo official provided the statement to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the affidavit says. But Jones has challenged Durham's statements about the allegations and claims they were coerced by orphanage officials in Kenya who kept him in isolation and confiscated his passport. Prosecutors have urged the judge to detain Durham and allege he is a danger to the community and could flee if released on bond . Jones urged Russell to reject the government's appeal and allow Durham to be released to his family on home incarceration while the case is litigated, which Jones indicated could take months. ‘This litigation, with witnesses and alleged victims in Kenya, will likely endure many months,’ Jones said in a written objection to the government's appeal. ‘Further incarceration would violate Mr. Durham's due process right, as he is presumed innocent and will be detained for a prolonged amount of time,’ Jones said. The magistrate ordered Durham's release after a hearing where his parents testified they do not believe the allegations against their son. The release order sets bond at $10,000 and names Durham's father, Oklahoma City Fire Department Maj. Kyle Durham, as his son's custodian. Kyle Durham testified he has taken administrative leave from his job to care for his son. It also requires that Matthew Durham surrender his passport, refrain from using cellphones and computers and avoid contact with children and any witnesses and alleged victims in the case.","Matthew Lane Durham, 19, is accused of sexually abusing up to ten children, ages four to ten, while volunteering in Kenya .

"Almost 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the Home Office to ban a controversial pick-up artist from entering the UK. Self-styled American dating guru Julien Blanc advises men to treat women with chilling disrespect and contempt - encouraging them to adopt his choking greeting technique. Other recommended pick-up methods include threatening to commit suicide, injuring pets, isolating women from friends and family and treating them 'like servants'. Scroll down for video . Sexist: Self-styled dating guru Julien Blanc advises men to treat women with chilling disrespect . The UK petition, started by Caroline Charles on campaigning website change.org, states: 'To allow this man into the UK legitimises sexual assault and predation, and sends a message that women are playthings or objects without agency.' Ms Charles adds: 'Julien Blanc dresses up his seminars as dating advice, which at best is disingenuous, he focuses on tricking women into having sex in order to make money. 'It is wrong on every level, it is promoting violence against women and girls, it takes advantage of men and it sends a message of survivors of sexual assault that they will not be listened to.' The petition has received considerable support on social media with Twitter and Facebook users repeatedly sharing the campaign. Mr Blanc has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'. Controversial: Julien Blanc uploaded this photo of himself and Russell Brand to his Instagram account 18 months ago . As well as a British tour planned for February, the online petition claims Mr Blanc is due to conduct a seminar in the UK on November 21 - just days after being kicked out of Australia for the content of his talks. The American was forced to abandon his planned Australian tour with his visa being revoked last Thursday. Campaign: The petition has been shared by thousands of people on Twitter . A similar petition to ban him from Canada has also been signed by around 50,000 people. A video published online shows him conducting one such seminar, urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.' He adds: 'At least in Tokyo, if you're a white male, you can do what you want.' Petition: More than 90,000 people are calling on him to be banned from the UK . He boasts that those who adopt his techniques will acquire 'panty-dropping masculinity' and learn to destroy the female 'b****-shield'. In June, the 'dating coach' charged men £2,000 each to attend a seminar in Miami. His website, PimpingMyGame.com, speaks about his ability to 'manage [a girl's] expectations' to allow men to cheat, and how other men 'would go to jail' for the things he says. On the site, Mr Blanc said his interest in picking up girls started when he read The Game - a novel written by Neil Strauss. One of the pick-up techniques he favours is to approach a woman and choke them before covering their mouth to hush them up . A page from Blanc's website says that his methods create the 'powerful emotions girls crave' In the book, Strauss documents his time learning about picking up women with a secret society of people led by a man only known as 'Mystery'. 'I wasn't a popular kid, and it sucked. But it didn't 'really' bother me, until one day I... found a link to The Game,' Mr Blanc wrote. He adds: 'I read a few pages of it and I was HOOKED. I had to try this whole 'walking up and talking to girls I've never met before and make them want to sleep with me' thing out... I was so off at first.' The UK petition is addressed in a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May and says: 'We petition you to deny Julien Blanc a UK Visa when his tour reaches the UK on November 21st. 'He and his association - Real Social Dynamics - promote sexist, racist and criminal approaches to women. His website, PimpingMyGame.com, boasts about his ability to 'manage [a girl's] expectations' to allow men to cheat . Mr Blanc has made a name for himself being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice' 'Please help British women stand with the women of Australia, the women of America, and women everywhere, and do not let the UK play host to events where men are being taught how to violate and harass women under the guise of 'dating advice'.' A Home Office spokesman told ITV News that they were aware of the petition, adding: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules. 'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.' A number of women's groups have spoken out against Mr Blanc. Sarah Green, from the UK's End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'We hope the Home Office will look at all the evidence available about Julien Blanc's activities and refuse him a visa. 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behaviour amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault. His comments and abuse of Asian women are deeply racist. The American, pictured outside Sydney Opera House, was forced to abandon his planned Australian tour with his visa being revoked last Thursday . Theresa May faces increasing pressure to prevent ‘pick-up artist’ Julien Blanc from acquiring a UK visa . 'More broadly, Julien Blanc is part of a culture which trivialises abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behaviour will not be taken seriously. 'We need an urgent public conversation about why a man like this can find a market and profit from the peddling of such vile misogyny.'

"An ex-orthopedic surgeon and an architect claim to have discovered the holy grail of fashion footwear: high heels that are genuinely comfortable. Dr Taryn Rose, a 47-year-old single mother-of-three based in California, already built a $40 million business with her first namesake shoe collection, and has now launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her next chapter: 'wing shoes.' The collection of heels are the brainchild of architect and designer Enrico Cuini, and have specially constructed carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles, which support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one. Scroll down for video . The holy grail? Dr Taryn Rose, a former orthopedic surgeon, and architect Enrico Cuini have created a line of high heeled shoes (pictured, the peep-toe sandal) which boast carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles . 'The wings ""flutter"" as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet,' Dr Rose tells MailOnline. 'This provides comfort and decreases swelling in your feet.' She adds: 'These wings make your feet feel stable, supported and secure, and gives them a ""platform"" to rest on so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel. 'The pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble.' Mr Cuini came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose to come on board. Formerly a European Windsurfing champion, Mr Cuini introduced strong but flexible materials to the shoes that are traditionally used to shape and streamline surfboards. Pretty fly: The wings (pictured) support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one . Secret weapon: The shoes are fitted with hidden platforms to rest on, so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel. Pictured, the platform stiletto (left) and the classic stiletto (right) Fancy feet: Their design also means that the pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble. Pictured, the laser-cut bootie (left) and the wedge (right) 'Mr Cuini brings a lot of different perspectives and industries to the shoe industry, which hasn't really changed in 100 years,' Dr Rose points out. The collection includes flip-flips and sneakers as well as classic stilettos, platform stilettos, wedges, peep-toe sandals and booties; all in a range of colors. Prices start at $350 and run up to $1995, but donors to the Kickstarter campaign are rewarded with shoes from the line at up to a 50per cent discount. As the company builds its customer base, they aim to lower the prices where possible. The campaign, which is hoping to raise $100,000 by November 5, will fund the manufacturing molds needed for the new wing technology. Teamwork: Mr Cuini (left) came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose (right) to come on board with her industry knowledge . Engineered to fit: The wings 'flutter' as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet, thus decreasing swelling . Dr Rose explains: 'We felt that with Kickstarter, it's a way for us to build the community from day one. 'This is a way for someone to be a part of our company from the very beginning whether it's a $5 pledge or a $10,000 pledge.' She and Mr Cuini have chosen to donate a sizable portion of the net profits from their shoes to philanthropic causes concerning water, education and health; something that might be unattractive to private investors, but she feels is crucial. So how did Dr Rose make the transition from orthopedic surgeon, to a shoe business she started in her garage, to a multi-millionaire footwear designer? 'As an orthopedic surgeon - and fashionista - I saw women who wanted to wear fashion shoes but suffered from how uncomfortable they can be...especially high heels. 'And of course, I dealt with several broken ankles from women falling off their heels, usually with the help of a few cocktails.' Construction: Dr Rose enlisted architect and engineer Enrico Cuini to help design the collection, and the Kickstarter campaign will fund the molds used to construct the shoes (pictured) Dr Rose, who earned her M.D. from the University of Southern California, was the first to use a memory foam-type material called Poron on shoes she crafted for diabetic patients to absorb shock. She then had the idea to marry the passion she had for her male dominated field - only around ten per cent of foot surgeons were women at the time - and her love of fashion. She became the first designer to use Poron in a line of fashion shoes, a collection she designed in her garage 17 years ago with Mr Cuini. 'When I saw the prototype that he had made on my kitchen table it took me two seconds to realize, ""this is the real deal... the next big revolution in footwear"".' Then and now: Dr Rose had the idea to marry the passion she had for orthopedic surgery with and her love of fashion, and gave up her medical career in 1997 to start her first shoe label, which she sold off in 2008 . Women loved the shoes and Dr Rose sold her first collection to Nordstrom. Over the next ten years, she stopped practicing as a surgeon and built a $40 million revenue business instead. 'Once I had the time to look at what I had accomplished, I realized I'd actually built a great company,' she recalls. 'It was hard to grasp.' One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps. She sold her Taryn Rose line in 2008 and spent the next eight years planning her next move. Mr Cuini came back on board two years ago, and inspired by a butterfly, the new wing technology was born. We're convinced! One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps (pictured) The surgeon-turned-designer, who is mom to Anneka, 14, Milo, 10, and Peter, 9, estimates she owns around 287 pairs of shoes currently. 'It's human nature to want to be desirable, and high heels do wonders for that,' she says. 'They make your legs appear more toned and elongated, your lower back more arched and your ""booty"" more prominent.' And for those of us who can't wait for her wing shoes to go to on sale, estimated to be June 2015, Dr Rose gave us her top tips for high heel shoe-shopping so as to to avoid ending up in pain. 'Shop at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, and look for shoes with some form of padding for your forefoot, since there's a lot of pressure in that region,' she advises. 'Look for shoes with a built-in platform to decrease the actual pitch of the shoe, and try not to go with shoes narrower than 1 cm of your own foot.'","The collection is priced between $350 and $1995 .

"A relative of a First World War hero was hit with a parking fine after she stopped her car to observe an Armistice Day silence. Anna Whitworth - whose great uncle Captain Reginald Salomons died saving his men during the 1915 Gallipoli campaign - pulled over safely at 11am on Tuesday to take part in the two minute silence being respected around the country. But the long-held tradition was less of a priority for a local parking warden, who quickly appeared on the scene and handed Ms Whitworth a fine. A motorist stopped her car near Kensington High Street on Tuesday to observe a two minutes' silence, but was left shocked when she was handed a parking ticket by a passing council warden . Ms Whitworth, 69, was driving along Kensington High Street, west London when she heard on the radio that it would soon be 11am. After finding a place to stop - which was on double yellow lines - she got out of her car to remember her great uncle and those like him to lost their lives in war. But her silence was interrupted by a parking warden, whose behaviour she has branded 'daft and unreasonable'. She told The Times: 'I told him I was only observing the silence for Armistice Day for those fallen in war, but he just looked completely blank. 'I told him he should have some respect, but he didn't respond and said instead that he was going to give me a ticket.' The incident happened while members of the public around the country stopped to remember the war dead. Pictured: King's Cross Station, London . Trafalgar Square comes to a halt on Tuesday. The council involved in the parking row has said it will consider refunding the parking ticket, but the motorist says she does not want to take the matter further . Kensington Borough Council officials have urged Ms Whitworth to get in touch, suggesting they may rescind the fine on appeal. But, speaking to MailOnline this morning, Ms Whitworth said she would not be taking the matter further. She said: 'Armistice Day is about peace and reconciliation and, in the spirit of that, I will not be making any further complaint.' Ms Whitworth's great uncle, who was from Kent, was on the HMS Hythe in 1915 when it sank in Turkey while on operations. He and 127 others died. Documents recently uncovered by historians show he helped other men off the ship first and gave his life-jacket to a comrade who could not swim. Captain Salomons died just days after his 30th birthday in October 1915 . The third David Salomons - known as Reggie or Reginald - was educated at Eton and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge before training as a lawyer. He later became involved with the territorial army and the training of local cadets in Kent. In 1912, he was appointed to command his father's cadet detachment in Southborough, Kent and at the outbreak of the First World War he moved to the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers. The field company sailed to the Mediterranean on October 11 1915 – one of the last groups to be sent before a War Cabinet decision to stop sending any more troops to Gallipoli came into force. On the October 28 that year, his ship ran into another British troop ship, the Sarnia, which was returning to Mudros Bay having left her passengers at Helles, in what is now Turkey. His heroism was uncovered by a historian two years ago when a letter to Capt Salomon's father, Col Sir David Lionel Salomons, a wealthy baronet from Tunbridge Wells, was found. The letter, from eyewitness Maj Alfred Ruston, stated: 'At the beginning, the two vessels clung to each other for a few minutes and about 50 men and several officers scrambled across on to the other vessel. 'But though Captain Salomons was warned to get over also himself, he would not do so and I am sure that it was because he would see his beloved men off first.'","Anna Whitworth's great uncle died during Gallipoli campaign of 1915 .

"A man caught on video slapping a woman in the face during a brawl on the New York subway has had charges against him dropped after investigators determined that he acted in self-defense. Jorge Pena said he was ‘horrified’ he had to hit a woman, but she gave him no choice. ‘Believe me, if she don't touch me like that... I'm never gonna put my hands on her. Never,’ said Dominican-born Pena. Scroll down for video . A tearful Pena said he was left with no choice after Danay Howard attached him with her 6-inch high-heel shoe and injured his ear . In the video, he is repeatedly mocked by 21-year-old Danay Howard who criticizes his 8-Ball jacket and accent before hitting him in the face with her 6-inch high-heel shoe. At that point Pena, who is 6 foot 6 inches tall, slap the woman in the face and a brawl ensued as several of her friends jumped in. He had been charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges after cell phone footage of the incident in an uptown F train around 5 a.m. on Saturday. Pena was left bleeding profusely after being attacked and at a press conference on Thursday and he showed off his injured ear. A tearful Pena said if he hadn't been provoked he would never have hit a woman - or anyone else, reports NBC4. He also said that the sorry incident had left him scared to use the subway and to even wear his favourite 8-Ball jacket. Danay Howard, 21, can be seen taunting Jorge Pena, 25, over his clothing before the argument turns physical . 'I can’t wear my jacket anymore,' said Pena, explaining that he was worried it might provoke an unwelcome response from someone who recognized him from the incident. Pena moved to New York City from the Dominican Republic to play minor league baseball for the Oakland A's, but his pitching career was sidelined when he injured his leg in 2010. Howard and Pena were both arrested at the West 4th Street subway station at about 5 a.m. on Saturday along with Howard's friends Kevin Gil, 21, and Shanique Campbell, 20, who had jumped into the fight to support her. Howard, the woman who was shockingly slapped across the face, has been hit with the most severe charges - felony assault and disorderly conduct. Gil, and Campbell each face misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges. In the footage, Howard can be seen taunting Pena on the Washington Square station-bound F train, when she was slapped so hard that she almost fell over. Howard and Pena were reportedly both arrested at the W. 4th St. subway station at about 5 a.m. Saturday along with Howard's friends Kevin Gil, 21, and Shanique Campbell, 20 . Another man jumped to her defense as the scene descended into chaos with the men raining punches down on each other. The video shows Howard on the train with her friends telling Pena, who is wearing a leather 8 Ball jacket and fur hat, to stay away before she starts to insult his clothing. Her friends egg her on and clap as she throws insults at the unnamed man, who nods and smiles at her. Howard tells Pena: 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s.' As she is holding a pair of high-heeled snake skin boots she says: ‘I’m done. You wanna know what shoes I’ve got on? They’re Steve Madden ones, alright?’ before sitting down. She was insulting his dress sense and told him 'You got a dumb*** 8 ball jacket that came out in the 1990s' The young woman's friends jump up when they see that another passenger is recording the argument . Her attention is then drawn to the man filming the incident after he tells her: ‘Nobody wears Steve Madden no more,’ and her friends jump up and charge towards him asking him what he is doing. He backs off but Howard knocks the phone from his hand – sending it flying to the ground but it is still recording and he tells her ‘you’re petty as hell – you can’t even afford this.’ The man picks it up but she knocks it from his hands again before continuing her attack on Pena. 'You sound stupid,' she shouts at him from behind before hitting him on the back of his head with her boot. Howard continues to taunt Pena by telling him he sounds stupid before she hits him on the back of his head . A man steps in in an attempt to break up the fight but is unsuccessful and also ends up in the middle of the fight . He then swiftly turns round and slaps her hard across the cheek, creating a loud smacking noise. The girl's friend jumps in and the situation quickly spirals out of control with several people trying to hit each other, while the cameraman screams in excitement. Another man steps in to break up the fight and eventually two of the men are separated. The video, titled 'Man smacks the soul out of girl on the NY Subway', has since gone viral and even led to remixed versions online.","Jorge Pena has had misdemeanor charges against him dropped after investigators determined that he acted in self-defense .

"A school in Harrow in north west London has angered teachers and MPs by telling staff not to use red ink when marking homework . Teachers have been told not to use red link to mark homework to avoid upsetting pupils. The edict has been condemned as ‘absolutely political correctness gone wild’ which risks leaving students in the dark about where they have gone wrong. Ministers have been forced to distance themselves from the bizarre policy, insisting no government rules exist on what colour pens teachers use. The policy would appear to be at odds with the back to basics approach of Education Secretary Michael Gove who has insisted teachers must mark pupils down for poor spelling and grammar. He has warned that in the past too little has been done to focus on core skills to ensure young people are confident in key writing skills. Tory MP Bob Blackman revealed his anger after being told a secondary school in his Harrow East constituency had banned teachers from using red ink. He told MailOnline: ‘A teacher . contacted me and said I cannot believe I have been instructed by my head . to mark children’s homework in particular colours and not to use . certain colours. ‘It is all about not wanting to discourage youngsters if their work is marked wrong. ‘It sounds to me like some petty edict which is nonsense. It is absolutely political correctness gone wild. ‘My take on all this is to say children need to understand the difference between what’s right and what’s wrong.’ Tory MP Bob Blackman slammed the unnamed school in his Harrow East constituency for telling teachers not to use red ink, prompting education minister Liz Truss to insist the government has not issued a ban . Mr Blackman took his concerns to ministers, tabling a parliamentary question whether the government issues guidelines which ‘prohibit or discourage the use of red ink for the purposes of marking or commenting on students’ schoolwork’. Elizabeth Truss, the ministers responsible for school attendance and cutting bureaucracy, insisted: ‘No, the Department does not issue guidelines which prohibit or discourage the use of red ink for marking student’s schoolwork.’ It is thought the policy is set by the headteacher, and not Labour-run Harrow council. Mr Blackman refused to name the school to protect the teacher who had spoken out. But he said he was going to take the issue up with the headteacher to ensure pupils were told when they had got things wrong. Mr Blackman added: ‘If they have got their homework wrong they need to be told it is wrong and to understand what the right answers are. The idea that they should use this or that colour is madness.’ A study by the University of Colorado warned that red is associated with 'warning, prohibition, caution, anger, embarrassment and being wrong' Earlier this year a US study suggested that teachers should stop using red pens because the colour is associated with 'warning, prohibition, caution, anger, embarrassment and being wrong'. Researchers showed students think they've been assessed more harshly when their work is covered in red ink compared to more neutral colours like blue. Sociologists Richard Dukes and Heather Albanesi from the University of Colorado told the Journal of Social Science: 'The red grading pen can upset students and weaken teacher-student relations and perhaps learning.' Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, slammed the findings saying: 'In my own experience of 35 years in teaching is that children actually prefer teachers to use red ink because they can read comments more easily. 'I think this research is misguided. The problem with using a colour like green or blue is that it's not clear. A lot of schools seem to have a culture where they don't like critcising children but actually this helps them. 'It's not intimidating children want to see where they've made a mistake. I think it's a rather silly idea.' Under the last Labour government red ink was banned in hundreds of schools because it was considered . 'confrontational' and 'threatening'.","Bob Blackman was contacted by a Harrow teacher angry at edict from head .

"The teenager who stabbed his teacher to death in a brutal classroom killing is getting 'fanmail' from deluded youngsters, it emerged today. Mixed-up teenagers have gone online to praise Will Cornick, the murderer of Spanish teacher Ann Maguire, and he is reportedly being sent letters from admiring peers. Some youngsters have even used the term 'good times' - the words uttered by Cornick in the moments after his horrific attack - as a sickening catchphrase. Will Cornick (left) was jailed for at least 20 years for the murder of teacher Ann Maguire (right). He is now reportedly receiving 'fanmail' after youngsters praised him online . Cornick, 16, has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the murder of the popular teacher at Corpus Christi College in Leeds in April this year. But a Facebook group set up in his name has seen some teenage girls claim they find the 16-year-old killer attractive. After website users attacked Cornick, one girl wrote: 'Calm down. I love Will!!!' in a comment that was then 'liked' by a friend. In another 'liked' comment, a schoolgirl wrote: 'He's so buff.' When asked what she meant, she replied: 'Good looking.' One girl even repeated the phrase Cornick used after he stabbed his teacher, writing  'good times' on the page, followed by a thumbs up symbol. Again, her comment was 'liked' by others. Cornick's own Facebook page (pictured) has been taken down, but 'community pages' with comments about him have sprung up since his sentencing . The killing, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK . Another message on the page comes from an Italian girl who is trying to get in contact with Cornick,  saying she feels 'sorry for' him and describing him as a 'friend'. The online comments emerged as it was reported that Cornick has received messages from teenagers around the world as he begins his prison term. The Daily Star quoted a source close to the case who claimed: 'He is getting letters from boys and girls from England, the US and Australia. Some are from girls saying he is cute and they want to marry him.' Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released. Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'. Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.","Cornick murdered teacher Mrs Maguire in classroom attack in April .

"James Burdall caused 350 people to lose their jobs while he spent money on swimming pools and fine art in a £1.2million scam . A fraudster’s £1.2million scam caused 350 people to lose their jobs while he spent the money on swimming pools and fine art. James Burdall, 49, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, stole the money from the ice cream business of his closest friend, who had trusted him with his livelihood after suffering a heart attack. But instead of ensuring his friend’s business continued to be a success, as well as keeping his employees in work, Burdall immediately started transferring money into his account. He used the money to buy an indoor swimming pool, fine art, a private school education for his children and landscaped gardens. Burdall admitted four counts of fraud by abuse of position at an earlier hearing, and appeared for sentencing at Sheffield Crown Court today. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for each charge, to be served concurrently. South Yorkshire Police’s financial crime investigation unit began a complex and protracted investigation into Burdall’s activities in July 2010, following allegations made by Sheffield entrepreneur Lawrence Wosskow. Mr Wosskow was the owner of Bradwells Ice Cream Limited, as well as the Out of Town Leisure Group Limited, a holding that operated a number of food outlets at shopping centres across the UK - the majority of which were at the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield. After suffering a heart attack in 2006, Mr Wosskow made the decision to emigrate with his family and left Burdall to oversee his businesses. But, from the very start of their arrangement, Burdall started to transfer funds from the accounts of Mr Wosskow’s companies to the accounts of his own business. This photograph shows the luxury swimming pool Burdall bought with the money he stole from the ice cream business of his closest friend . From here, much of the money went to his own personal accounts where it was used to fund a lavish lifestyle. All this was done without the knowledge or permission of Mr Wosskow, who had no idea that Burdall was draining funds from his companies. But in July 2010, Mr Wosskow received information from a business associate and challenged Burdall as to his actions. Burdall admitted to taking money from Mr Wosskow’s companies, but it was some days later before the full extent of his dishonesty came to light. It was then determined that the Out of Town Leisure Group could not be saved and it was placed into administration, leading to the loss of around 350 jobs. Most of these were at Meadowhall, where workers arrived at the Oasis food court to see the shutters down on the food outlets. South Yorkshire Police's financial crime investigation unit began a complex and protracted investigation into Burdall's activities in July 2010, following allegations made by Sheffield entrepreneur Lawrence Wosskow . Graham Wragg, fraud manager at South Yorkshire Police, said: ‘Burdall’s actions can only be described as the cynical abuse of the trust and friendship placed in him by Lawrence Wosskow. ‘In his self-serving pursuit of an extravagant lifestyle he caused the loss of the livelihood of 350 ordinary individuals and risked further damage to the health of his former friend. ‘I would like to commend all those who worked tirelessly on this investigation, for several years, in order to bring Burdall to justice today.’ Mr Wosskow said that the actions of his former friend had a devastating impact on he and his family. He said: ‘James and I had been friends since our schooldays and, after our paths went in separate directions, we met up again in 2005 through a mutual love of cycling. ‘We quickly became best friends and, when I suffered a heart attack a year later, James was very supportive. After suffering a heart attack in 2006, Mr Wosskow made the decision to emigrate with his family and he left Burdall to oversee his businesses. This is what he spent the money on . ‘He became my closest friend and, when me and my family emigrated for the good of my health, he was the person I thought could be best trusted to oversee my businesses. ‘His actions have had a huge impact on my health and also my finances, as when the Out of Town group was placed into administration Bradwells ice cream company was also in a very precarious position. ‘Owing to a promise I had made when buying the company in 1992, I had no choice but to honour that promise and save the company - which I did by injecting a considerable sum of money into it. ‘I am very glad that he has now been brought to justice and will pay for his crimes, which left hundreds of hard-working people out of work through no fault of their own.’ Burdall used the money to buy a swimming pool, fine art, private school education and landscaped gardens .","James Burdall stole money from his closest friend's ice cream business .

"A father-to-be was hacked to death in a carefully-planned revenge attack after his movements were tracked using Facebook, the Old Bailey heard. Danny Gough, 24, was cut down with an axe and a machete by three masked men in front of his pregnant fiancée as part of a vicious feud, it is claimed. He had just been on a weekend trip to Brighton but announced his return home to Croydon on his Facebook account, jurors were told. Father-to-be Mr Gough (left) was murdered in front of fiancee Kareena Modashia (right) One of the alleged killers, Sam Monteith, 32, accessed the page using his laptop just hours before Mr Gough was murdered in front of Kareena Modashia. It is claimed Stephen Dougherty, 35, and Paul West, 29, were the other two attackers. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC, making his closing speech to the jury, admitted that there was no forensic evidence linking any of the three to the scene but highlighted other factors pointing to the involvement of all three men. He said: ‘The venture was carefully planned, the participants had acquired detailed knowledge not only as to the location but also as to the interior of the address and where people might be. ‘They knew that Danny Gough, their target, was present and where he was. ‘It leads to the conclusion that they took steps to avoid identification. Whoever did it made damn sure there was no evidence. Killed: Danny Gough, 24, was cut down with an axe and a machete over an apparent feud . On trial: Paul West is accused of attacking Mr Gough in Croydon . ‘There is no identifiable DNA, no fingerprint, no distinctive footmark, no facial recognition, because they were covered and no weapon discarded. ‘Above all there was one very obvious conclusion. This was a revenge attack of a particular kind, intended to be a statement. ‘If you are able to work out those who have motives for revenge and who had motivations for a revenge of this particular kind, you are much further down the track. ‘All of these factors become relevant when considering who the killers are.’ Monteith, Dougherty and West were captured on CCTV meeting together ten days before the murder. The following day the movement of their phones was ‘consistent with surveillance’ of the victim, it is claimed. On the day before the attack Mr Gough updated his Facebook status with the message: ‘Had a great weekend, coming home.’ It is claimed the murder was part of an ongoing feud between Mr Gough’s friend Leanne Meredith and Monteith. Dougherty claims it began when Ms Meredith’s sister mocked Monteith’s ‘wacky’ trousers in a pub in June 2010. On November 3 Monteith was slashed and sprayed at his home by three men, including Mr Gough, it is said. West, of Slough, Berkshire, and Dougherty, of no fixed address but formerly of Mijas, Spain, both deny murder. Monteith, of Sutton, is not before the court as he is currently unfit to stand trial. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Danny Gough, 24, was cut down with an axe and machete by three men .

"Blessed with children as well as a career outside the home, working mums may seem to have it all. But actually they suffer a double guilt burden – that they are bad mothers because they work and bad employees because they have a family, a study shows. Researchers found that working mothers agonised more about their job outside the office than fathers and had more negative thoughts about their family while at work. Guilt: Mother-of-four Victoria Beckham (with husband David and sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn) admitted to Vogue last year that she feels 'guilty' every time she goes out to work . Both parents think about their . families, but only for mothers is this type of thought associated with . increased stress and negative emotions. Shira . Offer, an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology and . Anthropology at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, studied mental labour in . working parents in pressurised jobs. She . defines the term as thoughts and concerns that can impair performance, . make it difficult to focus on tasks, and even hurt our sleep. The . study, presented to the American Sociological Association, relies on data . from the 500 Family Study, which investigates how . middle-class families balance family and work experiences. The . study looked at 402 American mothers and 291 fathers in dual-earner . families who completed a survey and a time and emotions diary. Asst . Professor Offer found that working mothers engaged in mental labour in about . one fourth of their waking time. Working fathers spent one fifth of their working time engaged in it. This amounts to approximately 29 and 24 hours per week of mental labour for mothers and fathers, respectively. Working guilt: Sarah Jessica Parker starred in the film 'I Don't Know How She Does It', playing ever-juggling working mother Kate Reddy . However, . mothers and fathers both spent about 30 percent of the time they were . engaged in mental labour thinking about family matters. Last year, Victoria Beckham spoke of her guilt of going out to work. Mrs Beckham - mother to Brooklyn, 14, Romeo, 11, Cruz, eight, and Harper, two, - admitted balancing her parenting duties with managing her clothing empire leaves her feeling 'constantly guilty'. Speaking at London's Vogue Festival, the 39-year-old, said: 'I think you feel so torn, don't you? But I've got great people who handle my schedule and everything does revolve around the children.' Commenting on her research, Asst . Professor Offer said: 'What my research actually shows is that gender differences in . mental labour are more a matter of quality than quantity. 'I assume that because mothers . bear the major responsibility for childcare and family life, when they . think about family matters, they tend to think about the less pleasant . aspects of it and are more likely to be worried.' Asst . Prof Offer added: 'We know that mothers are the ones who usually adjust . their work schedule to meet family demands, such as staying home with a . sick child. 'Desperate to be with her': Daybreak presenter Lorraine Kelly said last year that she 'suffered terribly from working mother guilt' 'Therefore, . mothers may feel that they do not devote enough time to their job and . have to ‘catch up,’ and, as a result, they are easily preoccupied with . job-related matters outside the workplace. 'This illustrates the double burden, the pressure to be ""good"" mothers and ""good"" workers, that working mums experience. 'I thought that highly educated fathers holding professional and managerial positions would often be preoccupied with job matters when doing things such as housework or during their free time. 'It appears, however, that fathers are quite adept at leaving their work concerns behind and are better able to draw boundaries between work and home. 'I believe that fathers can afford to do that because someone else, namely their spouse, assumes the major responsibility for the household and childcare.' She added: 'It is true that fathers today are more involved in childrearing and do more housework than in previous generations, but the major responsibility for the domestic realm continues to disproportionately fall on mothers’ shoulders and this has to change.'","Mothers agonise more about their job outside work hours than fathers .
They also worry more about family life while at work, say Israeli researchers .

"Divine intervention: Nurse Omolayo Abayomi asked Jesus for help as a baby in her care suffered a heart attack . A nurse who threw her hands into the air and begged for Jesus to help as a baby suffered a heart attack has been thrown out of the profession. Omolayo Abayomi 'panicked' when the child, who suffered from a chronic lung disease, turned blue and stopped breathing in his cot at home. The 51-year-old called for divine intervention more than 20 times before the vulnerable boy's mother told her to 'shut up'. 'The nurse was constantly saying ""Jesus help him"" and waving her arms around,' a hearing was told. The nurse 'provided wholly inadequate care' by leaving the frantic mother to resuscitate her lifeless son, while the father dialled 999. Abayomi was found guilty of a string of charges by the Nursing and Midwifery Council at a hearing in central London. Sydney Topping, for Abayomi, insisted . his client's behaviour had represented no more than a 'bad day at the . office' and urged the panel to let her off with a caution. 'Once in a while you have a bad day at the office,' he said. 'I would suggest that on April 8 the . registrant had a bad day at the office. It was no worse than that. She . has bounced back since then.' The hearing heard that the child, referred to a Patient A, and his twin sister were born three months premature at Homerton University Hospital in Hackney, east London, and as a result suffered from a number of serious illnesses and so required round-the-clock care. Joanna Dirmikis, for the NMC, said Abayomi had been employed by private nursing firm Paediatric Nursing Link to look after the infant, who required 22 hours of nursing care every day. The parents were woken by a knock on . their bedroom door at 5am on April 8, 2007, to find their son lying . lifeless after suffering respiratory cardiac arrest, the panel was told. Premature birth: The hearing heard the baby was born three months early at Homerton University Hospital in Hackney, London, and had a number of serious health problems which meant he needed round the clock care . 'While Mrs A was trying to resuscitate the child, Mr A called 999,' said Miss Dirmikis. 'The twin sister of the little boy was also present during the incident and can be heard crying in the background during the call.' 'She panicked and at one stage even summoned divine intervention, calling for Jesus,' she added. Paramedics rushed the boy to Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone, east London, before he was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital on the same day for further treatment. Giving evidence, a tearful Mrs A said Abayomi had effectively 'abandoned' her during the incident. Recovery: The boy was taken to Great Ormond Street Hospital for treatment after being moved from Whipps Cross Hospital in Leytonstone in London . 'The nurse was constantly saying ""Jesus help him"" and waving her arms around,' she said. 'She said it more than 20 times. I felt I had to do everything - at that point she was doing nothing to help my son. 'She never offered to take the lead at any point and at no point did she suggest calling 999. 'I can't change what's happened to my son, I know I did the best for him but the nurse just completely abandoned her duty. 'If I can save just one other person from having to go through what we have been through, then that's what I want to do.' The panel heard Patient A, now aged five, made a full recovery from . the incident but is still totally . dependent on others for his care. Abaymo claimed the mother had pushed her away and refused to let her help. She denied calling out for Jesus, panicking and failing to provide care or basic life support. The nurse further denied failing to properly handover the case to paramedics and making inaccurate and false notes about the incident. She was cleared of specific charges that she suctioned the child's tracheostomy tube or that she failed to record observations taken but was found guilty of misconduct and ruled unfit to continue working without restrictions. Striking Abayomi off, panel chair . John Williams said: 'This was a failure to accept responsibility for her . role in the events by the registrant. 'She has shown a lack of empathy with . the parents of the child and there has been no admission or apology, and . therefore no insight. 'This failure is incompatible with her continuing to be a registered nurse.'","Omolayo Abayomi cried 'Jesus help him' 20 times before the child’s mother told her to ‘shut up’

"Tragedy: The baby son of Marianne Matthews, pictured, died in a sling during a ten-minute walk on Christmas Eve . A baby boy died in a sling during a ten-minute walk with his mother on Christmas Eve, an inquest heard. Eric Matthews was only five weeks old when he accidentally suffocated as his mother Marianne tried to calm him down. The tragedy prompted the coroner to raise concerns about the safety of the slings, which have grown in popularity in recent years and have been used by celebrity mothers such as Gwyneth Paltrow. The inquest also heard that six children have died in slings in the UK, while 16 deaths have been recorded in the US and Canada. An emotional Mrs Matthews, attending the inquest with her 48-year-old partner Robert, said she had learned to position her child in the sling from a parenting manual, suggesting it was safest against her chest. She issued a warning to other parents over the dangers posed by the slings, saying: ‘I don’t want to scaremonger but I think it isn’t known about.’ Mrs Matthews, a 35-year-old textile artist, added: ‘All the baby books say that slings are good for babies. We knew the cot death stuff about babies on their backs that is really well known. But we didn’t know about this at all.’ The parents told the inquest how they decided to take their crying child for a walk on Christmas Eve last year in an attempt to calm him down. They were forced to perform emergency CPR after returning home to find that Eric was not breathing and had blood coming from his nose. Despite their efforts, he died in Great Ormond Street Hospital eight days later. Mr Matthews, from Harrow in North . London, told St Pancras Coroner’s Court: ‘We went for a short walk with . him. He was in the sling. 'He was crying in the beginning, then he . stopped crying. On the way back he was falling asleep. When we got home . we found he wasn’t breathing.’ Tragedy: Eric's parents were forced to perform CPR after returning home to find that he was not breathing. Despite their efforts, he died in Great Ormond Street Hospital eight days later . Carrying babies in slings and baby carriers has grown in popularity in recent years, with celebrity devotees including Jools Oliver, pictured with her son Buddy Bear in a Baby Bjorn baby carrier, which is designed to ensure there is no possible risk of suffocation . The inquest also heard how Dr Rosemary Scott, a senior pathologist, had started to investigate deaths caused by the slings. Paediatric . pathologist Dr Mary Malone, who carried out a post-mortem examination . of the baby, said that such deaths were  usually caused by the child’s . position leading to asphyxiation. She said that six similar cases had been recorded in Britain, and 16 in America and Canada. Coroner Richard Brittain described it as an ‘extremely tragic death’, ruling that the cause of death was the baby’s airways being blocked. He added: ‘We heard from Dr Malone there have been similar circumstances that occurred internationally and also in the UK that do raise some concerns as to the safety of the slings.’ Mrs Matthews has opened a page on the charity website Justgiving using her son’s full name – Eric Laser Matthews. The total raised stood today at £2,592. She wrote: ‘Eric’s short life has made us want to give something back to those who helped us in those difficult last days.  The amazing people at Great Ormond Street showed great care and dedication.’ The type of sling used by the Matthews family was not identified. A Californian company was forced to recall more than a million slings in 2010 after reports that they had been involved in the deaths of three babies. Baby slings have been used by parents for thousands of years and, when used correctly, can soothe the baby while keeping the adult's hands free to get on with other things. The practice of keeping babies - and small children - close to their mother's body in slings is known as babywearing, and is one of the central tenets of attachment parenting (AP). AP is a parenting philosophy whose devotees believe a child's development is enhanced by the security of it being kept close to its parents. Jools Oliver, Holly Willoughby, and Nicole Kidman are among celebrities who have been photographed 'wearing' their babies in slings. Popular practice: Holly Willoughby, left, and Nicole Kidman, right, have both carried their babies in slings . But the practice can be dangerous. Seven babies are known to have suffocated in slings in Britain and 16 in North America in recent years, while three have died this way in Australia since 2010. Scientists at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) are now developing an education campaign to teach parents how to use slings safely after discovering that one in 20 babies carried in a sling has been injured or narrowly avoided injury as a result. 'Parents using slings should check their babies frequently, particularly if they show signs of distress, suddenly stop crying, or make any unusual sounds.' Victoria Ward, of Babywearing UK . QUT's Dr Kirsten Vallmuur said the main risk with using a sling was putting the baby in a C-shaped position, which could restrict their breathing and lead to suffocation. Meanwhile common injuries included the baby falling out of the sling, the adult wearing the sling slipping or falling, and the baby being hurt while being put into or taken out of the baby carrier. Victoria Ward, from Babywearing UK, said the usage of slings and baby carriers was growing in the UK, not least because it can be safer for babies to have their daytime naps in slings rather than alone in a bedroom. She told MailOnline: 'Parents using slings should follow the TICKS advice: Keep your baby Tight, In view, Close enough to kiss, Keep their chin off their chest, and Supported back. 'The ideal position is usually an upright one, and you should check the baby frequently, particularly if they show signs of distress, suddenly stop crying, or make any unusual sounds.' Sling safety: Parents who want to use a sling are advised to keep the child's nose and mouth uncovered .","Eric Matthews was only five weeks old when he accidentally suffocated .

"The oldest motorboat still afloat in Europe, which was used in the 1908 Olympics, at one time lay neglected in a Thames boatyard for 14 years - but it has now found its sea legs again after a major renovation. The wooden 'trials boat', which was snapped up for a mere £400 four years ago, has been lovingly restored to its former glory. It now has an estimated value 1,000 times that amount at £400,000. The 25ft-long vessel, believed to have been built by boatmakers Thornycroft in 1902, was purchased by and restored for transport collector Wint Taylor. Ship ahoy: The Fixitor was bought by collector Wint Taylor for £400 in 2009 and after renovation is worth £400,000 . 'Fixitor', named by previous owner Michael Hawkins in 1949 after joking to 'fix it or leave it', because it required so much restoration work back then, has a fascinating history. Built in the early 20th Century, it is one of the oldest motorboats in the world and its current engine means it reaches at speeds of up to 18mph - the same as its heyday. Amazingly, it is also the only boat to appear in all three royal pageants marking the Queen's coronation, Silver and Diamond Jubilee. Three commemorative plaques are now screwed to the dashboard to mark this special achievement. Further evidence confirms it was also used in the 1908 Olympics - the only time power boat racing has ever featured at the event. During Fixitor's restoration, traces of 'British Racing Green' paint were found underneath the hull - the colour used for the Games. Mr Taylor, who is an engineer aged in his 60s, said: 'It's the oldest power boat in Europe - there are other boats around, but they're not still afloat. 'It has no flat surfaces on the hull or on the deck and this helps give us the date. 'It also has holes for tow ropes, which is a sign of an Olympic trial boat as these were the only ones which had them.' Sporting history: During renovation, it was discovered that the boat had taken part in the 1908 Olympics . Shipshape: The boat is back to its former glory, but at one time it lay neglected in a Thames boatyard for 14 years . The oldest motorboat still afloat in Europe is also the only one to feature in the three royal pageants marking the Queen's coronation, Silver and Diamond Jubilee . Today, 'Fixitor' is fitted with a 1950's MG 1500cc 4 cylinder sports car engine. Originally, the boat would have had a rather more basic petrol unit used in aircraft, but they were very heavy in comparison to their power output. The unreliable engine propellers were not replaced until the First World War, when they developed as lighter, efficient engines used in aircraft. Eventually the technology trickled down to boats. Rediscovered and restored, the Fixitor was reunited with former owner Ann Hawkins of Farnborough at this year's Henley rally, where it won the People's Choice Award. Her late husband Michael, who named it Fixitor, bought it in 1949 from an army officer stationed abroad. Back then the boat had been sitting in a garden in Fleet for at least ten years and was without an engine. Michael named her Fixitor after an old Navy joke - ""fix it or leave it"" - because it required so much work. The couple would cruise on inland waterways and the upper Thames and together they owned her until selling Fixitor in 1995. It . then remained in the yard until Classic Restoration Services of Windsor . bought it in July 2009 at the Traditional Thames Boat Rally for Mr . Taylor, who lives in West London. Stephen Messer, a boatbuilder for Classic Restoration Services, spotted the vessel near the company's exhibition tent. It was not long before he realised the ship's potential. Hull lot of love: The Fixitor would have disintegrated further without the much-needed renovation work . Rock bottom: The Fixitor in its pre-renovated state . Clues on board: Wint Taylor knew this was a high-quality boat by looking at the craftmanship and lightweight construction, which are indicative of a racing boat . He said: 'I looked at it and realised it was an interesting hull. I thought ""this could be quite special"".' The £400 purchase, from Michael Dennett's boatbuilders yard in Chertsey exhibiting at the rally, has proved a shrewd investment. According to Mr Taylor, the clues were in the fixings on the mahogany hull planks, which were carefully doubled up, which is a sign of high quality craftmanship. It also had a lightweight construction, a detail which indicated it is a racing boat. Mr Messer contacted the Classic Boat Museum on the Isle of Wight, which first identified the hull as a classic state of the art 1900 racing yacht design. The original seat position and special connection points for tow ropes located on board tied in with the appearance of early racing trials boats. These were raced in the first-ever British International Harmsworth Trophy in 1903, which pitted wooden powerboats against each other. It was Thornycroft who built the majority of early wooden racers for trials racing - and Fixitor's build matches those used in the first event. The distinctive curved 'Art Nouveau' structure of the hull is typical of early English racers used in the event. Classic Offshore Powerboat club secretary Martin Napier said the curved design for the hull, also known as 'hard chine', was common for early racing boats. He said: 'Hard chine hulls rise up to 'plane' on the surface of the water, thereby reducing the boat's resistance and increasing its speed.' The British International Harmsworth Trophy still exists today for modern powerboats, but they now reach speeds of around 100mph. Mike James, 63, Commodore for the Classic Offshore Powerboat Club, said: 'The boat is absolutely stunning. 'I've never seen anything that old restored to such a beautiful standard. 'It's very typical of the boats from the early 1900s. 'The Americans are fanatical about this sort of boat, but this is one of the best.' In its heyday: The Fixitor was built with a classic state-of-the-art 1900 racing yacht design . Mr Taylor didn't disclose how much he had spent on the restoration, but says it was worth every penny given its current value. Mr Messer said: 'I have been quoted by American experts that it could make half a million dollars.' The figure derives from price comparisons with other wooden motorboats being sold at North American auctions. According to Mr Messer, the most valuable are those built before the First World War. Another early powerboat from 1912 is still on the water on the Isle of Wight, but lacks the history of  Fixitor. And a similar French motorboat from the same era is held at the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath, USA, but no longer floats. Its condition has deteriorated massively in comparison to the Fixitor, and it no longer sits on the water. Mr Messer said: 'They described it to me and said it was in deep storage, which I think basically means it is a pile of wood on the floor.'","Fixitor is the oldest motorboat still afloat in Europe .

"The Chancellor is expected to announce the Treasury's funding of the investigation into six major banks . George Osborne will today offer a blank cheque to fraud investigators seeking to bring bankers accused of rigging currency markets to justice. The Chancellor will write to the Serious Fraud Office urging it to pursue a ‘blockbuster case’ against traders who clubbed together to fix foreign exchange (forex) rates. Six banks were this week fined after it emerged City workers were making what they called ‘free money’ by fixing currency rates in the 60 seconds before the close of trading and then making huge cash transfers. Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, UBS and Bank of America were handed a total of £2.6billion in fines from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for the latest scam. Regulators discovered that some of the manipulation of the £3trillion-a-day forex market was taking place even as the banks were being probed over a previous scandal over interbank lending rate Libor. The SFO is in the early stages of a major forex investigation. Funding for such probes – so-called ‘blockbuster cases’ – is provided with agreement with the Treasury. It provided more than £10million to pursue criminal wrongdoing in the Libor scandal – and is expected to make a similar sum available for the latest probe. Mr Osborne is expected to say: ‘We must continue to pursue criminal wrong-doing at the highest level; I have always made sure that the SFO has the funds it requires for its investigations. ‘I understand that the SFO is in the early stages of a major investigation into Forex trading. Given the importance of this work, the Treasury will provide the required funding for this investigation.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the public was ‘seething’ at the latest scandal. ‘I hope [the SFO] will bring people to book,’ he told LBC Radio. ‘People are seething with anger that they’re having to endure cuts and savings for year after year after year because of not only irresponsible, in some cases possibly criminal, behaviour by bankers.’ Punishment: Five of the world's biggest banks, including HSBC, have been fined a total of £2bn for colluding to make money from the foreign exchange market . Mr Clegg said it had not yet been decided what the Government would do with the £1.1billion of fines levied by the UK regulator. Fines over the Libor rate scandal have been used to support military charities and other good causes. In the latest scam, investigators found traders formed groups to help them manipulate currency exchange rates that would profit the banks at the expense of clients. Transcripts of conversations show how the traders referred to ‘free money’ and not wanting other ‘numpties’ in the market to know what they were doing. As well as inflating profits for their banks, traders are suspected of using the scam to boost their bonuses. Martin Mallett was fired this week for 'serious misconduct' The Bank of England last night faced calls from MPs to reveal why it sacked a senior official criticised for his role in the forex rigging scandal. Mystery surrounds the dismissal of chief currency dealer Martin Mallett, fired this week for ‘serious misconduct’ after 28 years at the central bank, just 24 hours before six of the world’s biggest banks were fined £2.6billion over the scam. The Bank said Mr Mallett’s dismissal ‘was not at all related’ to the scandal, but to a breach of the Bank’s ‘internal policies’. Last night two MPs on the Treasury Committee called on the Bank to explain precisely why he had been sacked. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘The Bank clearly has a duty to give that information – preferably publicly.’ Tory MP Mark Garnier added: ‘We need to find out what happened.’ The committee can exercise Parliamentary privilege to ask for confidential information. An independent investigation led by Lord Grabiner QC found no evidence any Bank official was aware of the actions of the traders. But it also found Mr Mallett was ‘uncomfortable’ with traders’ practices but ‘did not escalate the matter’. The Bank of England declined to comment.","Treasury expected to fund investigation into six banks over rigging rates .

"A wheelchair-bound council equalities advisor who was caught attempting to have sex with a five-year-old girl and her mother is facing jail today. Andrew Holdsworth-Wild, 58, was arrested at Victoria Station in central London with condoms, a box of Smarties, a colouring book and train tickets to Maidstone, Kent. The Westminster Council officer organised a liaison at a Travelodge with 'Jo', an undercover cop, and her fictional daughter 'Chloe', Southwark Crown Court heard. Andrew Holdsworth-Wild is to be sentenced after attempting to have sex with a five-year-old girl as part of an undercover sting . Covert officers initially made contact with Holdsworth-Wild on the True Nudist website on February 22, 2011. The conversations then moved to an MSN forum where he said he enjoyed getting naked with his imaginary 'daughter' and liked 'playing, having sex and sexy times'. Holdsworth-Wild also said he would 'love to play with a family' and made incestuous suggestions to Jo. He was arrested on July 21, 2011, following the internet sting and was later sacked from his position as inclusion and access officer at the council, after an internal probe. Holdsworth-Wild was today found guilty of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence, following a retrial. He admitted possessing a level one indecent image of a child at the start of his original trial in August 2012. Holdsworth-Wild was caught at Victoria train station with condoms, a box of Smarties and a colouring book . Holdsworth-Wild appeared to be in shock while relatives in the public gallery sobbed as the verdict was announced. Adjourning sentence until May 3, Judge John Price said he could not promise that a custodial sentence would not be imposed. Prosecutor James Norman told the jury: 'This case is, in short, about the defendant's efforts to have sex with a five-year-old girl. 'Between February and July, 2011, he made arrangements to have a sexual encounter with a five-year-old girl called Chloe and her mother, Jo. 'On July 21, he went to Victoria Station to meet Jo and Chloe and was going to take them to a Travelodge in Kent where he stayed for work. Holdsworth-Wild was an equalities advisor for Westminster City Council . 'He brought a box of condoms and while he waited for them to arrive, he also bought a box of Smarties and a colouring book. 'Fortunately Chloe does not exist and Jo is an undercover police officer. 'The only people who met him were other police officers who arrested him. 'The prosecution say the defendant intentionally arranged to have a sexual encounter with Chloe, a five-year-old girl.' 'Mr Holdsworth-Wild does not deny having had online conversations with undercover police officers during which he made arrangements to have sex with Chloe. 'However, his case is those conversations were nothing more than fantasies and he never intended to go through with it.' A covert internet investigator called 'Gary' was deployed to the True Nudist website to snare paedophiles on May 22, 2011, Mr Norman said. 'He then suggested moving the conversation to MSN. From that point onwards, unbeknown to Mr Holdsworth-Wild, the conversation was being recorded by police.' Holdsworth-Wild told Gary that he and his made-up daughter 'just started getting nude at home'. 'She sees me getting aroused and says she would like to help. He also said: 'I like to share our bodies', adding that he liked 'playing, having sex and sexy times'. Holdsworth-Wild also said he would 'love to play with a family' and 'I would like to have kids play with me.' 'That is an unambiguous statement of paedophilia and an intention to carry that out if he gets the opportunity', said Mr Norman. Judge John Price at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) has postponed sentencing until May 3 . Holdsworth-Wild also turned what had been a 'mundane' conversation with Jo into something more sinister, asking if her 10-year-old son was 'old enough to understand your needs'. 'At the defendant's instigation there was a conversation about incestuous sexual activity between Jo and her son, which is obviously something he is interested in and excited by.' Holdsworth-Wild, from Truro, Cornwall, denies a single count of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence.","Andrew Holdsworth-Wild was caught as part of a police sting in 2011 .

"Firearms officer Carol Howard, 34, told a tribunal that she was singled out and spied on by a male colleague in the Met Police . A black firearms officer who was once . Scotland Yard’s Olympics security poster girl claimed she was singled . out and spied on by a bullying officer dubbed the 'little weasel', a tribunal heard today. Carol . Howard, 34, an elite Diplomatic Protection Group (DPG) officer who helped guard London from terror attacks during the 2012 Games, claims she . was picked on and treated unfairly by her supervisor, Acting Inspector Dave Kelly. And she told a tribunal that the Metropolitan Police had not learned any lessons since the Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry branded it 'institutionally racist'. PC Carol Howard told the hearing today how Mr Kelly 'targeted her', and said: 'There has been a blatant cover-up by the Met. The police have not learned any lessons from the Macpherson Report, and they still continue to discriminate.' Miss Howard, who is suing the Met for racial and sexual discrimination, said no other Authorised Firearms Officer (AFO) in the white, . male-dominated Diplomatic Protection Group was subjected to the same . scrutiny . In . her witness statement, Miss Howard, who has been an AFO since 2010, said she worked hard to become one of only two black, female AFOs in the DPG, but that her career was 'disrupted' when Mr . Kelly was posted to DPG in around December 2011. From then on, she told the tribunal in a statement, she was 'targeted, subjected to detrimental treatment, and harassed' by him. 'It . was evident that the other sergeants found him annoying... he was . often referred to as the ""little weasel"" by supervisors', she added. Miss Howard first met the acting inspector when she was posted outside the American Embassy in London, and said she found him 'smarmy.' 'My . first impression was that he seemed friendly, although unctuous,' she said in her statement.  'This . is because our conversation felt forced and somewhat unnatural - I felt he came across a little smarmy.' She said he invited her to take part in shooting practice in front of her male colleagues, and said: 'I was really upset that he was making me look incompetent amongst the guys, especially as I had worked hard not to stand out.' The officer said that a colleague told her Mr Kelly had checked her Facebook account while she was off work sick after dropping a dumb-bell on her foot, and said to colleagues that she . was 'taking the mickey'. Miss Howard said: 'I . was not aware of Kelly looking at anyone else’s Facebook while at work . while that officer is on sick leave, and I believe that this is another . example where I was treated less favourably than others.' Miss Howard, pictured at the tribunal and in work gear, is suing the Met for racial and sexual discrimination . In November 2012, Miss Howard said she put in an official complaint after discovering that Mr Kelly had been spying on her while she was working outside the American Embassy using CCTV. She said: 'Further . to this, I received a hostile attack by Kelly where he pinned me in the . corner and pointed his fingers in my face in a threatening manor while . carrying his Glock pistol. 'I was very intimidated by this attack.' Miss . Howard subsequently lost her Fairness at Work complaint, which she . described as a 'whitewash' and an 'attempt to sweep my claims under the . carpet.' She said there were 'significant delays' in the investigation, and a number of her complaints were not even looked at. The firearms officer also told how she was picked to be in a photoshoot for a newspaper article about the London Olympics, and said she believed she was picked to represent diversity following the controversial police shooting of Mark Duggan in August 2011. Miss Howard claimed that Mr Kelly spied on her via CCTV as she guarded the US embassy in London (file image) In . her statement she said: 'I was prompted by the . respondent’s press officer, Steve, on what to say in response to certain . issues. 'The questions put to me concerned the public perception of firearm officers, and references were made to our bad reputation. 'In my opinion, it was based around Mark Duggan.  I . felt I had been singled out and chosen to represent diversity and to . change the public image of white police shooting black youth.' The . officer later found out that she had . been singled out due to her colour, the tribunal heard, leaving her feeling 'betrayed' and 'used as a token'. She also said that on one occasion, she was picked to drive Doreen Lawrence in what she believed was an attempt by her bosses to show Mrs Lawrence how far the Met had come since the inquiry into her son's death. Officer: Miss Howard said Mr Kelly picked on her because of 'his attraction to me and my disinterest' She said: 'I felt I had been called upon to demonstrate to Mrs . Lawrence that the organisation had come a long way as here I stood as a . successful black female officer.' The tribunal heard how Miss Howard faced disciplinary proceedings for dishonesty after requesting emergency leave when her thought her car had been stolen. In fact, her Mini Cooper had been towed away by a bailiff after she'd failed to pay a parking fine, and she was forced to pay £1,100 to get her Mini Cooper back. The hearing was told that Mr Kelly referred her to the Directorate of Professional Standards reporting for dishonesty and integrity, although the charges against her were dropped. Miss Howard, who is currently signed off sick with work-related stress, said: 'Throughout my policing career, I have worked hard and have had a good rapport with my policing colleagues. Tribunal: Miss Howard said Mr Kelly picked on her because of 'his attraction towards me and my disinterest' 'When Acting Inspector Dave Kelly joined the team, I no longer enjoyed being at work and he made me question whether I want to be a police officer at all. 'He has robbed me of the chance to fulfill my aspirations of working as an AFO...  By doing nothing, the DPG have encouraged Kelly's ill-treatment and allowed it to continue. They chose to turn a blind eye and made excuses for his behaviour. 'The DPG have encouraged him to single me out, bully me, allow him to act in an aggressive manor towards me on one occasion when he was carrying his gun.' She added: 'I believe the reasons for my malicious, unethical treatment at the hands of Kelly is a direct result of discrimination based on my race, sex and my looks, Kelly's attraction towards me and my disinterest.' The Met Police has said it will 'robustly defend' itself against Miss Howard's claims.  The tribunal continues.

"A young mother tried to sell her four-month-old boy on the internet for £150,000, it emerged last night. The 20-year-old advertised the ‘beautiful’ baby for sale on the Gumtree classifieds website on Boxing Day. Police and social services were alerted after scores of people saw the ad and dialled 999. Sale: This advert, which appeared on Craigslist on Boxing Day, lead to a woman having her children taken away . Officers traced the woman and took the child and his two-year-old brother into care. Last night the single mother, who suffers from post-natal depression, said the advert was just a ‘silly joke’ that backfired. She claimed she had been dared to post it, but had no intention of going through with the sale and has been left devastated that her two sons have been taken away. The full-time mother from Bradford said: ‘I had been joking with my ex about selling sperm and eggs and he sort of dared me to put up a baby for sale – but I didn’t mean our children. ‘I put on Gumtree that I was selling a baby for £150,000. I just plucked that number out of thin air and I claimed I was acting as an agent for a friend. ‘It was very stupid and I shouldn’t have done it, but I didn’t think it would be taken seriously. ‘I love my boys and they make me so happy and I want them to be happy. It was just a silly, silly joke. The single mother now claims that it was a 'silly, silly joke' which her ex boyfriend had dared her to do . ‘I was crying and begging at this one social worker’s feet, but she just took my son away. ‘I am so upset and just want my boys back. It is my mistake, my stupidity. It should be me who is locked up, not the boys having to live with strangers. This is making my depression even worse. ‘I am so sorry. I have not even been allowed to speak to them on the phone and I don’t know when I’ll see them again. I hope it is soon and they can come back to me.’ The advert appeared on Thursday evening. Initially it read: ‘baby, beautiful for sale deposit through pay pal email only’ and included a £150,000 price tag. It was later updated to read: ‘baby boy for sale comes with everything included deposit needed as sick of time wasters.’ One shocked user who emailed the mother claimed she replied to say she was selling the child ‘because it cries’. When asked if the offer was genuine, the mother allegedly confirmed it was because she wouldn’t want to ‘shatter anyone’s dreams’. Last night the woman, who is separated from the father of her children, told how police arrived to take her two boys away. She added: ‘I told the police I was depressed and I am known to social services. They must know I would never harm them and wouldn’t sell them.’ It is illegal to buy or sell a child in Britain. Police said last night that  no one had been arrested. Instead they said the matter had been passed to social services. The woman said she first came into contact with social services when she developed post-natal depression following the birth of her first child in 2011. She claimed she also asked for help from social services after the birth of her second son in August, adding: ‘I asked them if they could help by putting me on a couple of courses, which they had done when I was suffering from post-natal depression with my first son, but they refused, saying I was coping okay. I knew I was struggling.’ The unnamed mother suffers from postnatal depression and says the loss of her boys is making it worse . The woman’s 40-year-old mother, a carer, said: ‘I think this is God testing us. I offered to look after the children, but social services wouldn’t entertain that. The boys should be here.’ She said police told her they would investigate her daughter for human trafficking, adding: ‘She had no intention of selling any child, let alone her own. 'She is suffering from post-natal depression, but that is not why she advertised on Gumtree. It was just a daft joke.’ Gumtree says items forbidden for sale under UK law should not be advertised or sold. It could not be contacted for comment last night. Detective Inspector Vanessa Smith, of Bradford police, said: ‘The child concerned, who is both fit and well, is being looked after in conjunction with relatives and social services. The mother is receiving appropriate care.’ Julie Jenkins, assistant director of children’s specialist services at Bradford council, added: ‘We worked with the police to establish the safety of the child and we have made sure the child and the family have appropriate support.’ Social services in Bradford came under the spotlight this year following the trial of Amanda Hutton, 43, whose four-year-old son Hamzah Khan was found mummified in 2011. She was jailed for 15 years for manslaughter in October. A review found that social services had missed warning signs that could have prevented the tragedy.","Single mother put advert on Craigslist on Boxing Day selling baby boy .

"Max Richmond was put into isolation for a day after he refused to wear a clip on tie . A schoolboy has been punished for refusing to wear a clip-on tie because he wants to wear a smarter traditional one - which breaches 'health and safety rules'. Max Richmond, 13, was put into isolation for a day, for wearing the proper tie at Colne Community School in Brightlingsea, Essex. The 1,438-pupil school insists pupils wear clip-on ties for health and safety reasons - but Max says the clip-on ones are uncomfortable and childish. He prefers to wear a traditional tie of exactly the same design, given to him by a neighbour. He was given work to complete on his own in a small cubicle for continuing to wear the tie. Max, of Waterside, Brightlingsea, said: 'It seems bizarre and unnecessary especially over something like the tie I was wearing. 'I like wearing a real tie because it feels proper. 'People have worn them for generations, and if you are not wearing one during secondary school then you are never going to learn the necessary skills for when you go into the world of work. 'When you are wearing a clip-on tie it is hard to be taken seriously, especially when you go to competitions against other schools - it feels foolish, and childish.' On their website in 2009, the Health and Safety Executive said it was a 'myth' that health and safety bans traditional school ties. The school has agreed to review the policy. Max says the clip-on ones are uncomfortable and childish. He prefers to wear a traditional tie of exactly the same design . Nardeep Sharma, headteacher, said the . rule was introduced about three years ago to support the health and . safety of young people . He said: 'This was in line with the practice in most secondary schools nationally. 'The policy can only be changed by governors and a parent has requested the governors review this policy, which the school has agreed to do.' Max said he welcomed the review and hoped the governors would take his points on board. Roger Bibbings, occupational safety adviser for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said schools can make pupils wear clip-on ties, but should not cite health and safety grounds. He said: .It might be a sensible precaution if a school insists on pupils wearing ties while handling rotating machinery, such as in a school workshop, but for any other reason you cannot say this policy was required under health and safety law.' The school said the rule was introduced about three years ago to support the health and safety of young people . The Health and Safety Executive's website says: 'Quite rightly, few parents would see wearing school ties as a safety issue. 'After all, millions of kids have been wearing ties for years without any real problems. 'Taking simple precautions during laboratory work or around machinery makes sense. But if the concern is about kids fighting, although clip-on ties may help, the real issue is discipline. 'So no, we don't ban school ties – it's down to the school to make decisions about uniform, not HSE.' A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive added: 'It seems to us to be a disproportionate response.' Linda Painter, of the Schoolwear Association, said that producers had reported a 'strong trend' in school opting for clip on ties, largely because every tie looks uniform and neat, but also because it means that the ties do not get wrapped around students' necks. She said: 'Lots of school do have clip on ties, it's a strong trend. It's not definitively about health and safety. 'Obviously they can come off quite easily and don't get stuck round children's necks, but clip-ons do mean that all the students' ties look the same and look smart.'","Teenager Max Richmond says children need to learn how to wear one .

"Rev Aubel has revealed witchcraft is thriving across rural parishes in Wales in his autobiography . A church minister has revealed witchcraft is very much alive and well in his Welsh rural parishes as he warns against becoming involved in the occult. Reverend Felix Aubel has spoken of how he has come across witches, the use of effigies and the 'evil eye' during his career in the Welsh countryside. He has detailed a number of spine-tingling tales after the latest figures in the 2011 census revealed 83 witches and 93 satanists are living in Wales. Rev Aubel, who is the minister of five Congregational chapels in rural Carmarthenshire, even detailed how he had to call out an exorcist after a witch placed a curse on one of his parishioners. He said: 'This is not a joke and I would warn people not to get involved in the occult. 'I have been told that a coven of witches still meet locally. 'There is also a witch living in a nearby village who advertises her services in the local paper.' In his autobiography, Rev Aubel describes how a curse on a parishioner had to be lifted by an exorcist after a 'poppet' or 'effigy' was made of a chapel member of his. He said: 'In folk-magic and witchcraft, a poppet is a doll made to represent a person, for casting spells on that person. 'A poppet or effigy would be used with very sharp needles stuck into its 'heart' as a way of doing evil to an enemy. 'It was this evil type of poppet that was used on a chapel member of mine in the Aberaeron area in 1994. 'It took an experienced Anglican exorcist to 'raise' this curse, which had been placed by a witch on the instruction of another former church member. 'The motivation behind this 'evil' was envy that had turned into jealousy.' Rev Aubel wrote the book, called A Rebel's Story, to act as a warning to people not to get entangle in the occult. Rev Aubel has detailed how he come across the use of effigies, the 'evil eye' and witches during his time as a church minister . The Carmarthenshire church minister, who has preached in West Wales for over 20 years, also said he had battled a case of the 'evil eye' which left a mother and her young child needing hospital treatment. He said: 'This is an ancient belief in the existence of a malevolent power in the glance of some people, which is almost invariably provoked by envy or jealousy. 'In this instance, a lady who had given birth to a baby boy was apparently wished bad luck by the ""evil glance"" in the eye of a childless spinster neighbour. The church minister has told of how he had to call out an exorcist, similar to the 1973 classic film, after a parishioner was cursed by a witch . 'Both mother and child were subsequently taken ill due to acute breathlessness for no apparent medical reason and had to be hospitalised. 'The spinster even visited the mother and child in hospital while I was speaking to them. 'It became obvious to me that the spinster was praising the baby to its mother in a very false and patronising way.' Rev Aubel said he had come across witches during his time as a minister, while the exorcist had to be called after an effigy, or poppet, was made of a chapel member of his . This is one of the most noticeable characteristics of the utilisation of the ""evil eye"". 'Realising this, I asked the spinster to say ""God bless you"" to the baby, having just said what a beautiful child the mother had. 'After that the spinster immediately walked away without uttering another word.' Rev Aubel said the mother later placed a horse shoe amulet in the porch of her home as a precautionary measure to protect her son and herself from the effects of the 'evil eye'.","Reverend Felix Aubel, of Carmarthenshire, has battled with the occult .

"Taking a stand: Ann Hodges took pictures showing evidence of drug use and displayed the photographs at the entrance of the building . A tenant in a block of flats blighted by drug abuse has been forced to remove photos of syringes and blood stains she pinned to a ‘wall of shame’.

"Hard-up: British families with a stay-at-home mum are worse off than in most of the developed world because of tough tax rules, researchers say . Families with stay-at-home mothers are worse off in the UK than in most countries across the developed world, new research has revealed. The tax burden on couples with two children but only one breadwinner is much higher because the UK fails to take family responsibilities as seriously as other rich nations, critics said today. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has looked at 33 of the world's most developed countries and found that the UK's tax system hinders families with one working parent, the majority of which are married couples. Across OECD countries the average tax rate for a typical family with one . stay-at-home parent and one working person is around six per cent, but is nearly ten per cent . in the UK. This is because there are not the significant tax breaks for them that are found in most other nations and can cost Britons thousands more in tax every year. It is believed that Chancellor George Osborne may consider a new tax allowance for married couples in his upcoming budget to try to rectify this inequality. The extra tax break could save millions of people up to £1,600 a year. In the OECD study researchers also found that a single person on the national average salary of £34,000 is better off than 83 per cent of the UK population after tax. But a couple with two children and a full time parent is only 40 per cent better off after tax. Today the Government was urged by CARE, the Christian social policy charity who helped finance the research, to adapt Britain's tax rules to help hard-working families who are currently losing out. 'UK one earner married couples with children carry a far greater tax burden that the OECD or EU average wage. We are out of line with all developed economies in ignoring the family,' CARE chief executive Nola Leach told the Daily Telegraph. Too tough: Campaigners are calling on the Treasury, pictured, to ease the tax burden on hard-working families . 'At all income points one earner families are lower in the income distribution than singles and couples without children. This cruel anomaly in the tax system is hurting families at a time when they need all the support they can get.' The Government is planning to raise the personal income tax allowance to £10,000 but Mrs Leach says that this is not necessarily the best way to support low and middle income families as it still favours the rich. Former Tory Chancellor under Margaret Thatcher, Lord Lawson, will launch the report tomorrow and also claim that the Coalition is hurting many British families and not helping them enough. It is still women who predominantly stay at home in the majority of British families with one breadwinner. But the number of house-husbands has tripled over the past 15 years and 14 per cent of families with children now have a father with the main responsibility for looking after the children.","UK tax rules are branded cruel and punishing for hard-working families .
The average tax .
rate for one-breadwinner families in rich countries is around 6% but nearly 10% in the UK .

"The company who provides and maintains the faulty scaffolding that left two men dangling 69 stories in the air at the World Trade Center on Wednesday afternoon has had two other major incident in just the past six years. The Tractel Group, the U.K. based company that is responsible for the equipment at the $3.9 billion skyscraper, even had one worker fall to their death using their equipment. This in addition to an incident just last year that is remarkably similar to what happened on Wednesday. Scroll down for videos . Problem company: The Tractel Group, the U.K. based company that is responsible for the scaffolding at One World Trade Center (above), has had three life-threatening incidents in seven years .

Edgar died immediately, while Alcides somehow managed to hold on, this despite bleeding in his brain, a collapsed lung and broken bones throughout his body. Death scene: The Solow Tower (above), where  one worker died and another was critically injured . He could not speak for weeks, and initially even the slightest movement could have been deadly. He miraculously managed to recover, and never again washed windows. On June 12, 2013, an incident unfolded at Manhattan's Hearst Tower that was almost exactly like what happened at One World Trade on Wednesday. Two scaffold-maintenance workers got caught between the forty-fourth and forty-fifth floors of the building. These two men, Stephen Schmidt and Victor Carballo, had their scaffolding buckle on them, and were waiting 90 minutes for firefighters to cut through the glass in the building and pull them in. And, as AOL points out, both of these incidents occurred with  equipment from The Tractel Group. There is no word yet if the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will attempt to get out of their contract with Tractel following this latest incident. The two men trapped outside and almost 1,000 feet high for 90 minutes yesterday, Juan Lopez and Juan Lizama, suffered no injuries, but were immediately rushed to New York City's Bellevue Hospital where they were treated for minor hypothermia. Lizama revealed in an interview that he was so certain that the rig was not going to hold up that he even called his wife to say goodbye for the final time, expressing how much he loved her and asking that she look after their children. They were saved when firefighters cut through the building's glass and pulled the men in to safety.

"A mixed race girl was subjected to monkey taunts by a gang of racist yobs after she accidentally stumbled into a National Front meeting. The seven-year-old had gone with her parents to a social club in Wavertree, Liverpool, to book their wedding reception but inadvertently walked into a room where 14 far-right activists were discussing group tactics. The yobs turned round as the girl walked through the door, and as soon as they saw her began shouting: 'F*** off back to where you come from' and started making monkey noises at her, it has been claimed. Vile: The little girl was apparently bombarded with foul, racist language and monkey noises by the far-right National Front. Members (unconnected with this case) are pictured here at a protest in London . The bewildered girl’s mother who is white and father who is from Sierra Leone pulled the youngster out of the room and reported the incident to police. Enquiries revealed the yobs had taped over CCTV cameras at Wavertree Cricketers Club, but some footage has been recovered by police and is now being studied to identify the culprits. Today the girl’s parents, aged 30 and 31, said no attempt had been made by club officials to turf the racist yobs out of the venue. They said the room had been decked out with Union flags and banners emblazoned with nationalist slogans. In an interview with Liverpool Echo, the girl’s mother, of south Liverpool, said their wedding plans were now in disarray because they would not set foot in the venue again. Wavertree Cricketers Club in Wavertree, Liverpool, where the alleged racist incident took place . They insisted there was no doubt the abuse was directed at their daughter. The mother said: 'They were shouting and telling her to f*** off back to where she came from and making monkey noises. 'Luckily, she did not really know what was going on, but I’ve brought her up to know that although she has different-coloured skin she is the same as everyone else. 'If she had understood what they were saying it could have scarred her for life.' Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson said: 'This incident has made me sick to the pit of my stomach. 'It’s hard to believe that so-called human beings can stoop to this sort of level. Thankfully the little girl doesn’t seem to have understood what was going on, but these would not have known that, they wouldn’t have given a toss. Far-right: The National Front supports the expulsion of all non-whites from the UK . 'We must be seen to challenge this kind of abhorrent behaviour and be tough on it when it is exposed.' Detective Inspector Lisa Mahon of Merseyside Police said: 'This has been a very distressing incident for a young girl and her family. 'I share her family's disgust, as clearly this alleged behaviour is not acceptable. A full investigation into the incident is underway and I would urge anyone with any information to come forward. 'We are working closely with the family and are offering them support. 'We have also spoken to residents in the area to reassure them that we are doing all that we can and to see if they have any information that can assist in our investigation.' The incident, which took place on Wednesday night, is not the first time the Cricketers has been at the centre of a row over far-right extremists. In 2011, the British National Party booked it for its annual conference, attended by leader Nick Griffin. The club’s owner Brian Washington said at the time that he had no knowledge that it was the BNP who had hired the venue until they arrived. Sanctions imposed on the club’s licence by the council were overturned on appeal, with the judge branding them 'excessive and unnecessary'. Mr Washington said he had not known the National Front had booked the room until they arrived, and was co-operating fully with the police investigation. He added he was also seeking police advice about his rights to ban the BNP from ever returning. Mr Washington said: 'The National Front are banned from here for life and as soon as I get an address for them I will be sending them notice of that officially and I will also send a copy to the police.' He added he had no sympathy with extremism, and at the weekend had an African group booked in to the venue. The National Front is a far-right, racial nationalist, whites-only political party. The cornerstone of the National Front's manifesto is the compulsory repatriation of all 'coloured' people in Britain, . The party claims to stand for 'white family values' and the 'Fourteen Words', a white nationalist slogan that states: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children'. The party works in open cooperation with the white supremacist and neo-Nazi website Stormfront . It put up 17 candidates in the 2010 general election and 18 candidates for the 2010 local elections. The party failed to gain any representation at either national or local level. As well as its racist beliefs, the party supports the re-criminalisation of homosexuality.","The girl's parents were thinking of using the venue for wedding reception .

"Upgraded: Amputee Nigel Ackland with his bebionic3 prosthetic limb - the most advanced in the world - which has transformed his life . The bionic man fitted with a high-tech robotic hand yesterday showed off his latest upgrade which is so advanced he can now tie his shoelaces again. Nigel Ackland from Royston, Cambridgeshire, has had his Terminator-like mechanical limb since last November, but it has now been upgraded to make it more sensitive. And after a recent accident involving a runaway dog which left the 53-year-old missing several robot fingers, designers have also reinforced the limb with stainless steel and titanium. It means the whole hand is stronger and the upgrade also included insulating pads stop it picking up heat or static electricity. 'Since I was first given the hand they have developed it several times whenever someone who is trialling it notices a design flaw,' Mr Ackland said. 'I was walking the dog and he took off chasing something ripping the lead out of my hand - but unfortunately the fingers came off too. 'So they added stainless steel into the links to make sure they were stronger and could with stand that kind of force again. 'Its crazy I can now tie my shoe laces for the first time in years and play with playing cards. I'm developing my use of the hand more and more daily. 'It really is a whole new quality of life.' Right-handed Mr Ackland, a former smelter, who lives with his wife Vanessa, 50, and son Conor, 19, lost his arm when it became caught in an industrial blending machine at the Johnson Matthey smelting plant in 2006. After six months of operations and infections he opted to have an elective trans-radial (below elbow) amputation. But the severity of Mr Ackland's . injury meant the amputation wasn't straightforward and left him with a . flared stump and difficulty finding suitable prosthetics. He . was forced to take early retirement, but struggled to help at home . became his dexterity was limited to the basic tasks he could perform . with a replacement hook.

Then, in May last year, Leeds-based prosthetics company RSLSteeper approached the beleaguered amputee and asked if he would like to trial their latest hand - the most high-tech available in the world. It has a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual's requirements. Mr Ackland operates the futuristic arm by sending the same signal from his brain he used to operate his original, human arm. The thought flexes muscles in his upper arm, movements which are detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips, mirroring human movements. The different patterns include a clenched fist, a pointed finger and a thumb and forefinger pincer motion that is lighter or heavier according to how the user tenses their upper arm. Card sharp: Mr Ackland, a former smelter, lost his arm when it became caught in an industrial blending machine at the Johnson Matthey smelting plant in 2006 . A video of Mr Ackland usin the hand has already notched up two million hits on YouTube. Nigel Ackland's bebionic3 myoelectric hand is the most high-tech prosthetic available anywhere in the world. It is controlled by the same signals from the user's brain that would have been used to operate his original, flesh and blood arm. When the muscles in the upper arm are flexed by the thoughts, these movements are detected by sensors that trigger one of 14 pre-programmed grips, mirroring human movements. The different grip patterns include a clenched fist, a pointed finger and a pinching motion, according to how the user tenses their upper arm. Mr Ackland is one of just seven people in the world to be given the arm as part of a four-month trial, which it is hoped will see the electronic arm made publicly available. The hand features a lifelike appearance and grip patterns which can be wirelessly programmed and tailored to suit each individual’s requirements. To make it look as natural as possible the hand can be covered with a realistic silicone skin, available in 19 different shades, although Mr Ackland has not been given one for the trial. 'Being a hit on YouTube is great - . people need to learn about what is out there and if it helps someone I . don't mind being on the web,' he said. 'After the video was posted and the first press stories a man from Canada began emailing me and he is now trialling the arm out there. 'Some people don't understand is how alienating loosing a limb can be and how the negative associations we have with hooks. 'When you think of fictional characters with a hook you have Captain Hook - well he's basically a terrorist - with this device people see the future. 'People will stop and say its like I-robot and the terminator, how they associate is half the battle with people understanding prosthetic limbs. 'When you first lose a limb it can take a massive blow to your confidence. 'People in the street don't really know how to react to the fact that you have no arm and as a result you can be left feeling exceptionally withdrawn. 'With the Terminator arm people will come up and ask you about it. 'I no longer feel like someone people avoid because they don't know what to say to me. 'It would be great if when a person did lose an arm, they got an arm like straight away.'

"A horrified mother found her 13-year-old daughter and her friend discussing the best way to make a sex tape after reading an X-rated e-book. Alarmed Melissa Crighton, 45, has now called on publishers to give books special adult ratings in an attempt to protect children. Ms Crighton caught her child and a pal reading aloud from 'It's All About The Sex Face: A Guide To Becoming A Celebrity'. Sex tapes: A London mother wants to put adult ratings on e-books to prevent children from accessing adult material after she caught her daughter reading how to make a sex tape to become famous. US reality TV personality Kim Kardashian, pictured, settled for $5 million to block distribution of a sex tape . The no-holds-barred manual gives explicit tips on how to produce a steamy sex video in an easy bid to achieve instant fame. The e-book, which costs just £1.02 to download from Amazon, claims you can 'actually become famous without even having a talent'. Sex tapes involving socialites such as Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian and actress Pamela Anderson, which have been leaked onto the internet, have forced them into the public eye. Some claim the tapes have furthered their celebrity status and careers. The NSPCC is now urging all parents to monitor their children's e-book reading and said all book retailers, on or offline, have a responsibility to prevent children buying hardcore adult material. Adult rating: The young girls were caught reading allowed from e-book: 'Its All About The Sex Face: A Guide To Becoming A Celebrity' Ms Crighton, of West Hampstead, north London, said: 'They were reading out the steps in the book about how to make a sex tape - how to produce it, how to get a co-star and how to leak it. 'I interrupted them and took the Kindle away and I spoke to them and said, ""This is not a book you should be reading"".' The mother-of-two added: 'I found the subject matter inappropriate. 'They have gone online to find books about how to get famous so it's worrying if this kind of stuff is being sold.' Ms Crighton said the raunchy e-book was downloaded by her daughter's mate on her mother's Kindle. Ms Crighton said she tipped the other mother off about the worrying incident immediately and the book was deleted. 'I think for kids a novel on a Kindle seems more like an app, something you can quickly download,' said the furious web designer. 'It's more accessible than going into a shop, so it's more difficult to monitor what children are reading. 'The Government should do something where they get publishers to say what is in the book or give them a rating.' Guidance and 'gentle age ratings' are included on some children's books for parents but publishers are not under any obligations to do so for adult literature. But the rapidly-increasing popularity of e-books is generating growing fears that kids can instantly access pornographic adult literature at the click of a button. Fame: US actress Pamela Anderson was one of the first celebrities to be involved in a leaked sex tape scandal, in 1998, with then-husband Tommy Lee . Jon Brown, head of sexual abuse at the NSPCC, said: 'It is really important to talk to your children about the risks that are out there either online or offline, in an age-appropriate way and without frightening them. 'Speak to them specifically about the risks of making a 'sex tape' and if it did get into the wrong hands, it could go viral online.' He added: 'We'd also urge you to be interested in what your children are reading and researching online and find out what your children's schools are doing about these issues as part of the curriculum. 'Book retailers on or offline have a responsibility not to sell over 18 material to children and young people under 18.' Rob Lowe and two unidentified women (1988)The actor's career was almost ruined when a tape leaked of him having sex with two women, one who was allegedly underage at the time.

"After winning more than £1million on the Lottery, Eloise Hutchinson could have let the windfall go to her head. Instead, she celebrated by  having a pub meal with her  boyfriend – and got him to pay. The 19-year-old has insisted that her feet will remain firmly on the ground despite scooping £1,346,840 – and becoming one of Britain’s richest teenagers in the process. So far she has succumbed to a modest shopping spree, limiting herself to an iPad and some clothes. She has also turned down her  sister’s request for a Range Rover, instead offering to hand over her 12-year-old Ford Fiesta. Eloise Hutchinson (right) initially thought just four of her numbers had been drawn, but her boyfriend David Heard (left) pointed out that she had all six . Miss Hutchinson, from  Colchester, said: ‘It still has not sunk in. Not at all. ‘I went and bought an iPad on  Friday . and then I went to Lakeside [shopping centre] on Saturday and did some . clothes shopping. I am going to just carry on as normal though. The . money will just help me out in future.’ Miss Hutchinson bought the lucky dip ticket at the Co-op store where she works part-time. Although she originally thought she . had matched only four numbers, it was her boyfriend of eight months, . David Heard, 25, who pointed out she had all six –  7, 11, 37, 38, 42 . and 44. The teenager, who lives in a . semi-detached house with her disabled mother Joanne and sister Sophie, . 17, a student, shared the New Year’s Eve jackpot with two other ticket . holders, both of whom have opted to remain anonymous. At a press . conference yesterday, Miss Hutchinson said: ‘I was actually at home when . I found out. ‘I didn’t check the ticket until New Year’s Day and it was not until the afternoon. ‘I didn’t find out how much it was until 8pm that evening when I got a call back and they told me I had won £1.3million.’ Miss Hutchinson with her cheque for £1,346,840 pounds that she won on New Year's Eve . Feet on the ground: Miss Hutchinson hasn't made any extravagant plans for her new-found wealth and keeps a track of how much she's spent in a book she carries with her at all times . A couple of days later she went out . for the meal with Mr Heard, a waiter, and two other friends. Miss . Hutchinson said: ‘I had soup for starter and a nice pork dish for my . main but there was no champagne as I was driving.’ And she revealed that friends had expected something completely different when she said she had some news. ‘Everyone’s said “You’re not pregnant are you?”’ she added. Miss Hutchinson is now planning a . holiday in Jamaica and may  move in with her boyfriend.  She has also . resolved to buy  herself a new Fiesta rather than an expensive car. And she plans to carry on working at . the supermarket and use the rest of her time to make a success of the . mobile beauty therapy business she set up last year with the help of the . Prince’s Trust. Mr Heard, who paid just over  £60 for . the celebratory meal, said: ‘I’m just so pleased for Eloise. It could . not have happened to a  nicer person.’ Drug addiction: 16-year-old lottery winner Callie Rogers . Eloise Hutchinson’s attitude is a far cry from that of previous  Lottery winner Callie Rogers, who was just 16 when she scooped the £1.9million jackpot in 2003. Within months, she had become addicted to drugs, including cocaine, and had spent much of her win on four homes, luxury cars and breast implants. She later made three attempts to kill herself, the last time in  2010 after she lost custody of her two children. Two years ago she revealed she had just £100,000 left of her win. Miss Rogers, now 25, from Cockermouth in Cumbria, said: ‘I am finally becoming the woman I want to be. 'And it’s only after I’ve spent most of my fortune that this has happened.’",Level-headed Eloise plans to work at Co-op as she builds up her beauty therapy business .
"Education Secretary Michael Gove said children needed longer school days and shorter holidays to keep pace with other countries . The traditional long summer school holiday is a relic of the 19th century and must be consigned to history, Michael Gove declared yesterday. The Education Secretary said it was wrong that terms were still scheduled for a time when children were needed to help out on farms and most mothers stayed at home. And he warned of more strikes ahead, accusing unions of lacking ambition and putting the needs of teachers before those of children in their care. Some schools have already overhauled their term patterns, abolishing the long six-week summer break. But Mr Gove wants every school to follow suit, with longer days and shorter holidays. He told an education conference: ‘We can’t afford an education system that was essentially set in the nineteenth century.’ The government has previously suggested the school day could be extended to last from 7.30am to 5.30pm, boosting learning and making it easier for parents to go to work. Mr Gove said ‘some of the best schools in the country’ recognise the need to change the structure of the school term and move to a longer school day. New powers for headteachers to pay good teachers more could also be used to increase school hours, he said. He also promised to tackle 'one or two legislative or bureaucratic obstacles' which stop all schools modernising their hours. ‘It’s . consistent with the pressures of a modern society.  I also think it’s . going to be family friendly,’ Mr Gove told the event organised by the . Spectator magazine. Ministers believe the change could herald cheaper holidays if term times are staggered while working parents would benefit from not having to take time off or find childcare for weeks on end. Should summer holidays for schoolchildren be shortened? Should summer holidays for schoolchildren be shortened? Now share your opinion . Under the current system, the school year is 190 days long. Pupils get around six weeks off in summer, two weeks at Christmas and Easter as well as three half-term breaks lasting a week each. School days usually run from around 9am to 3pm, or 3.30pm. But the Department for Education said a number of academies - which are free from local authority control - are already altering the length of the school day. Mr Gove said: ‘The structure of the school term and the school day was designed at a time when we had an agricultural economy. ‘I . remember half term in October when I was at school in Aberdeen was . called the tattie holiday - the period when kids would go to the fields . to pick potatoes. It was also at a time when the majority of mums stayed . home. ‘That world no . longer exists, and we can’t afford to have an education system that was . essentially, set in the nineteenth century.’ Two evacuees, Robert Yoghill and William Williams from Islington in London learn how to milk the cows by Eileen Hocking on her family farm in Cornwall. Mr Gove said long school holidays date back to schoolchildren working in an agriculture economy . Mr Gove's drive to overhaul school hours is backed by David Cameron. The . Prime Minister's official spokesman pointed to the need to 'reform a . whole series of parts of our education system to reflect the very modern . global race that the UK is in'. A Whitehall source added: 'We can either start working as hard as the Chinese, or we'll all soon be working for the Chinese.' In a speech Mr Gove said that pupils are . at a 'significant handicap' compared to youngsters in East Asian nations . who benefit from extra tuition and support from teachers. What is now known as six weeks of sun, fun and holidays were not always so. The summer break and other school holidays were during spring planting and early autumn harvests children were needed at home. They would help with the work in the fields or in the house during the busiest time of the agricultural calendar. Other . breaks in the school year would often be for financial reasons as . schools would shut due to lack funding to pay for coal to heat up the . classrooms in wintertime. Mr Gove said: 'One of the striking . things about East Asia is that they do not have what we have in England, . is the automatic assumption that you divide children into the achievers . and the others, the academic and the vocational. 'They . believe that every child can be educated. The assumption is that all . children at every year will absorb and learn the curriculum. And their . expectations are higher than in this country. 'School . days are longer, school holidays are shorter. The expectation is that . to succeed, hard work is at the heart of everything. 'And . if you look at the length of the school day in England, the length of . the summer holiday – and we compare it to the extra tuition and support . that children are receiving elsewhere - then we are fighting or actually . running in this global race in a way that ensures that we start with a . significant handicap.' However, teaching unions were quick to reject the idea of longer hours being of benefit to pupils. Earlier this month the National Union . of Teachers (NUT) demanded teachers spend just four hours a day in . classrooms, complaining school staff are facing 'totally unsustainable' workloads. Some schools have already moved to longer hours and fewer holidays (file picture) NUT general . secretary Christine Blower hit out at Mr Gove's proposal. She said: . 'Teachers and pupils already spend longer hours in the classroom than . most countries and also have some of the shortest summer holidays. 'Independent . schools in England and Wales, which often break for two weeks more . during the summer and have longer holidays at other times of the year . than their state counterparts, do not apparently feel the need to change . and are apparently not suffering from their reduced hours. 'Yet again we see the Education Secretary making policy up on the hoof with no real evidence for either the necessity for change or the benefit it brings.' Mr Gove said the school holidays system was set for a time when children were needed to help on farms . Brian Lightman, general secretary of . the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: 'Some . schools are introducing innovative changes to the school day and term . and it will be interesting to see what effect these have in the longer . term on achievement. 'But changes should be based on . sound, researched evidence, not on anecdotes from other countries with . vastly different cultures and attitudes to education. 'The quality of the learning . happening in classrooms when children are in school is more important . than the number of hours they spend there.' But Mr Gove also renewed his attack on . teaching unions, accusing them of fostering a ‘culture of low . expectations’ which is holding children back. He . added: ‘One of the tragedies of our time is that the teaching unions . have chosen to put the interests of adults, ahead of the needs of our . children. And that is why sadly, the unions, as a voice of teachers is . diminishing. ‘My challenge not to teachers, but to teaching unions – is to do a better job.’ Asked . if Britain was facing more strikes in schools, he replied: ‘Yes. There . seems to be a competition between the NUT and NASUWT to compete for . members, with each one trying to out radical the other. ‘I think that this is a golden opportunity for teachers to prove what they can achieve.’ He urged the unions to set up a Free School, offering to find them a building and provide funding.","Education Secretary calls for longer school days and shorter holidays .

"The BBC was criticised yesterday for filling its prime-time schedule with repeats of programmes shown in the past week. Amid more than six hours of reruns on BBC1 yesterday, shows such as Mrs Brown’s Boys, Not Going Out and John Bishop’s Christmas Show got prime-time billing just days after they first aired. And anyone who switched to BBC2 in the hope of finding something fresh would have been equally disappointed. It was also filled with reruns, including last Sunday’s final of The Choir. The Christmas special of Mrs Brown's Boys, watched by 9.4million people when it first aired on Christmas Day, was repeated at 10.20pm yesterday . The glut of repeats began on BBC1 at 1.50pm with Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas, which was first aired on the same channel just 16 hours earlier. The afternoon and early evening was filled with films and, after 30 minutes of EastEnders, viewers were once again treated to something from the archives – an episode of Miranda shown earlier this year. A new programme was shown at 9pm – the second instalment of the murder mystery Death Comes to Pemberley – but the rest of the evening was given over to repeats. The Christmas Day special of bawdy sitcom Mrs Brown’s Boys – watched by 9.4million people – was shown again at 10.20pm. It was followed by another sitcom, Not Going Out, last seen on Christmas Eve, and John Bishop’s Christmas Show, which had been screened on Monday. Almost half the BBC’s Christmas schedule was taken up by repeats – driven partly by spending cuts at the corporation. The number of reruns on BBC1 was up by ten per cent on last year . Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture media and sport committee, criticised the corporation for showing repeats in prime-time slots. ‘For many people this is still a holiday period, and lots of families are at home and want to watch something new,’ he said. A BBC spokesman said: ‘This Christmas over 90 per cent of programmes in peak time on BBC1 are brand new and have lead the festive ratings on both days. 'Across the schedule, there are some carefully chosen favourites repeated for audiences to enjoy who missed them first time round.’","Special of Mrs Brown's Boys repeated at 10.20pm yesterday .

"Facebook users are quitting the social network in droves due to privacy concerns and fear of internet addiction, according to new research. Increasing numbers are taking part in what's been dubbed 'virtual identity suicide' and deleting their accounts. Analysis of more than 600 people, by researchers from the University of Vienna, found that data protection issues and social pressure to add friends were also among the reasons for leaving. Others quoted shallow conversations, general dissatisfaction and loss of interest in the site. Facebook users are quitting the social network in droves due to privacy concerns and fear of internet addiction, according to research from Vienna University. Analysis of more than 600 people found that data protection issues and social pressure to add friends were also among the reasons for leaving . Privacy concerns: 48.3 per cent . General . dissatisfaction: 13.5 per cent . Shallow conversations: 12.6 per cent . Fear of becoming addicted: 6 per cent . More than half of residents in Canada, UK, Ireland, U.S, Australia and New Zealand use Facebook. Ireland has the most with 63 per cent, followed by Australia on 61 per cent. New Zealand has 58 per cent of people on the social network site, while the UK has 55 per cent and the U.S has 47 per cent. Facebook . in Ireland has 2.25 million monthly users. A third of Irish Facebook . users want less photos and more status updates and get annoyed by images . of their friends' children. Two in five Irish adults admitted to lying on Facebook. Source: Statcounters/Eircom B&A Survey 2013 . Earlier this year, reports suggested that Facebook lost nine million active monthly users in the U.S and two million in Britain. These figures originated from research carried out by SocialBakers in April. The figures come straight from Facebook's API, but is not the same as Facebook losing user numbers, for example. Monthly active users are the number of people who log into their account over a 30-day period. SocialBakers saw a drop in this figure prior to the report in April. However, only because a person doesn't log on for 30 days does not mean they have left the site entirely - which is where the distinction lies. That said, psychologist Stefan Stieger from the university recorded each of the 600 participants' responses to assessment measures based on their level of concern over various issues. Those who stopped using social media were more concerned about privacy, had higher addiction scores and tended to be more conscientious. Professor Stieger said: 'It could be possible that personality traits influence the likelihood of quitting one's Facebook account indirectly via privacy concerns and Internet addiction. 'In this case, the concern about . one's privacy and Internet addiction propensity would not be directly in . charge for quitting one's Facebook account, but would function as . mediators of the underlying personality traits. Quitters were older, on average, and more likely to be male. Reasons for quitting Facebook were mainly privacy concerns at 48.3 per cent, general dissatisfaction at 13.5 per cent, negative aspects of online friends, 12.6 per cent, and fear of getting addicted at 6 per cent . Compared to the sample of those who continued to use Facebook, the quitters were older, on average, and more likely to be male. Reasons for quitting Facebook were mainly privacy concerns (48.3 per cent), followed by a general dissatisfaction (13.5 per cent), negative aspects of online friends (12.6 per cent) and the feeling of getting addicted (6.0 per cent). Brenda Wiederhold, editor of the journal Cyberpsychology, Behaviour and Social Networking which published the findings, said: 'Given high profile stories such as WikiLeaks and the recent NSA surveillance reports, individual citizens are becoming increasingly more wary of cyber-related privacy concerns. 'With photo tags, profiling, and internet dependency issues, research such as Professor Stieger's is very timely.' According to journalist Sarah Kessler from FastCompany, leaving Facebook can be a long-winded and difficult process. After struggling to find the Delete Account option, which she eventually found by searching Google, she was met with photos of a selection of her Facebook friends with an automated message about how much they'd miss her if she left. She was then asked to tell Facebook the reasons why she was leaving, which she said was due to privacy concerns, before Facebook tried to persuade her to stay by explaining more about how the site handles private data. Facebook warned her that by deleting her account she'd lose all of her photos and posts, before trying to convince her to stay by telling her she could deactivate her account for as long as she liked, and then just login to reactivate. By deactivating, everything on her profile would stay where it is but would become hidden in case she wanted to return to the site. 'Facebook’s hard sell did not stop me from deactivating my account. But three days later, when I wanted to get in touch with an old friend, I reactivated my account like an ex-girlfriend who can't quite commit to a breakup--just as Facebook had designed,' said Kessler. Kessler claims that Facebook uses four persuasion techniques to make people stay and these include making it complicated, giving people the option to take a break rather than delete it completely, tapping in to personal friendships and connections and trying to solve any problems the user has.","Report suggests Facebook recently lost active users in the U.S and UK .

"Pupils face a ban on mobile phones in school as part of a new Ofsted crackdown on classroom discipline. Schools will be penalised for failing to tackle persistent low-level disruption in lessons under a tough new inspection regime being introduced next term. This could force teachers to forbid mobile phone use by pupils – including texting, taking calls and surfing the web – to avoid being marked down by inspectors. Ringing the changes: Pupils face a ban on using mobile phones in school under a tough new crackdown by Ofsted on discipline (picture posed by models) It will also cover other forms of disruption, including back-chatting and calling out, which damage education for well-behaved classmates. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said that apart from the distracting effect of a mobile going off in a lesson, handsets can be used for cyber-bullying and accessing online pornography at school. In an interview with the Mail, Sir Michael told how, as a headmaster, he banned his pupils from bringing phones to school. Recalling his experience as head of Mossbourne Academy in Hackney, east London, he said: ‘It certainly cut out all that nonsense that you have in schools of these things being brought in and then a mobile phone going off in a lesson. ‘The outrageous behaviour that you occasionally see in all schools is serious, but I think the bigger issue is that low-level disruption which takes place which stops children learning effectively. Teachers and head teachers have got to stamp that out.’ Tackling disruption: New Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, pictured at Mossbourne Academy in east London, where, as head, he banned mobile phones. He believes such measures should be rolled out across the country . Sir Michael added that bullying via . phones and the internet could be ‘disruptive and pernicious’ and he . treated the menace as seriously as a fight in the playground. He will use a keynote speech today to . pledge to push ahead with an overhaul of the school inspection regime . despite a revolt by head teachers and claims of ‘bully  boy tactics’. Under his reforms, 6,000 schools currently deemed ‘satisfactory’ will be rebadged in the next academic year as ‘requiring improvement’. ‘I know this is a tough message but I think in a few years’ time it will be seen as a right one,’ he said. ‘I’m not a bully and never have been. We are raising the game. We are saying that all children deserve a good education and nothing less.’ Ofsted’s sharper focus on standards of behaviour is expected to lead to schools taking a tougher line on mobiles. New laws brought in last month give teachers powers to search pupils for handsets if they are banned under school rules. Staff may also search pupils for phones if they suspect they are being used to view pornography. Few . schools currently impose an outright ban on bringing handsets to . school. Many allow them as long as they are kept switched off and stowed . away. But teachers warn that once mobiles are in school, they face a battle to make sure they are switched off all day. Teachers . who contributed to an online forum said: ‘Officially, we do not allow . phones and will confiscate if seen. In reality, kids wander round using . them as they like.’ Another . warned: ‘I’ve had the situation where I’ve demanded the phone from, . say, a Year 10 boy (I’m female) and they just shove the phone inside . their boxers and say “You want it, you get it!”’ Nowhere to hide: Richard Cairns (above), headmaster of Brighton College, will tell a conference that heads who fail to sack incompetent teachers should have their pay docked . Sir . Michael went on to reveal that heads will be expected to deal more . effectively with teachers who cannot control their classes. They will be marked down if they fail to manage the performance of struggling teachers, for example by waving through unjustified pay rises. ‘If the culture of the school is good and somebody is consistently under-performing because they are not teaching effectively, leading to that low-level disruption, that’s got to be picked up,’ said Sir Michael. ‘Where head teachers find that teachers are consistently underperforming, where there is that low-level disruption in every lesson, no matter what the professional development taking place in the school, then action needs to be taken.’ Sir Michael plans to extend Ofsted’s reach to the new chains springing up to run academies, which operate outside local authority influence but are state-funded. At a conference today at Brighton College, he will say he has not been deterred from pressing ahead with toughening up the system, and that a consultation on the proposals attracted wide support, including from parents. Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, will tell the conference that heads who fail to sack incompetent teachers should have their pay docked. ‘No head teacher should ever tolerate bad teaching. Yet up and down the land, that is precisely what is going on. ‘Too many head teachers are prepared to take their relatively generous salaries yet duck the issue of the bad teacher in the staff room.’ A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘Parents should take responsibility for whether or not their children have phones in the first place. It is up to individual head teachers to decide if and when mobile phones should be used by pupils in school.’","Sir Michael Wilshaw says handsets can be used to access porn in lessons .

"Original texts: The first ever editions of the Brothers Grimm, released in 1812, reveals a far darker side to children's stories known around the world . 'Here's a knife... if the slipper is still too tight for you, then cut off a piece of your foot. It will hurt a bit. But what does that matter.' If you ever had Cinderella read to you as a child, you probably won't be familiar with this extract - where the stepsisters are urged by their mother to self-mutilate in a bid to marry the prince. Incidentally, he then noticed the blood sloshing around in the 'golden' slipper, thus thwarting their ugly scheming. If you're not familiar with this grimmer version of the Brothers Grimm tale, you're not alone - as it comes from the first-ever English translation of their original edition, which was released in 1812. And it's not just Cinderella which was wholly unsuitable bedtime reading for children: Rapunzel becomes pregnant after having a 'merry time' with her prince in the tower - and it's Snow White's real, not step, mother who orders the huntsman to 'stab her to death'. Elsewhere it's Hansel and Gretel's biological mother who abandons them in the forest because she can't afford to feed them. When Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, from Hanau, Germany, published the first version of the now classic collection, then called Children's And Household Tales, they had no idea the 86 stories would reach such a wide audience. A second volume of 70 tales followed in 1815 - and another six editions over the next 40 years, each one revised and, crucially, more and more child-friendly. In the process, some of the most unsavoury ones were left out, such as How The Children Played At Slaughtering - in which one boy cuts the throat of his little brother while playing butcher and pig. Another later omitted was Children Of The Famine, where a mother threatens to kill her daughters since there is nothing left to eat. Jack Zipes, professor emeritus of German and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota, decided to go back to the Grimms' roots out of curiosity and translate the first two editions (all 156 tales) which was published last month as The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: The Complete First Edition. He believes that the pair changed the stories in the later editions because they 'held motherhood sacred'. Changes: In the first two editions of the Grimm tales, Rapunzel becomes pregnant after having a 'merry time' with her prince in the tower while in Hansel and Gretel it's their biological mother who abandons them in the forest because she can't afford to feed them . According to The Guardian, he speculates that the Grimms' changes were 'reflecting sociologically a condition that existed during their lifetime - jealousy between a young stepmother and stepdaughter as 'many women died from childbirth in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and there were numerous instances in which the father remarried a young woman, perhaps close in age to the father's eldest daughter.' The academic, who took 18 months to translate the text, told the paper that the changes made were 'immense', suggesting the original tales were not published with children in mind, with up to 50 tales heavily edited or deleted for later editions. For example Zipes believes Wilhelm Grimm got rid of the tales that would a 'religious middle-class sensitivity'. In the introduction to the book, he writes: 'All these editorial changes to the tales in the first edition of 1812/15 should not lead us to believe that the tales were crude, needed improvement, and do not deserve our attention. 'Moreover, the Grimms had not yet 'vaccinated' or censored them with their sentimental Christianity and puritanical ideology. In fact, the Brothers endeavoured to keep their hands off the tales, so to speak, and reproduce them more or less as they heard them or received them. 'That is, the tales were not their own in the first place. Though they gradually made them their own, these stories retained other voices and still do. They originated through the storytelling of various friends and anonymous sources and were often taken from print materials.' Zipes adds: 'These first-edition Grimms' tales have a beguiling honesty and an unusual perspective on human behaviour and culture.' Gruesome: In the original Cinderella, her stepsisters try to cut off part of their feet with a knife so they can fit into the slipper . Authors: Jack Zipes said the Grimm brothers (pictured together right and left) changed the stories in the later editions because they 'held motherhood sacred' Not aimed at children: Snow White's real, not step, mother orders the huntsman to 'stab her to death' Twist to the story: As evidence of her death, the mother asks the huntsman to bring back her lungs and liver as proof that she has been killed . '[The 1812 edition] was not published for children or general readers... It was only after the Grimms published two editions primarily for adults that they changed their attitude and decided to produce a shorter edition for middle-class families. This led to [the] editing and censoring many of the tales,' he told The Guardian. Some stories were later omitted, not due to their gruesome quality, but their heritage: for example, Bluebeard and Puss In Boots were not reprinted because of their French origin. The new book, published by Princeton University Press, offers a fascinating insight into how the collection has changed with the times. Professor Zipes pointed out that around 50 stories in the first edition were either deleted or radically revised by the seventh edition in 1857, considered as the standard version even today.

"Kim, Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian know fashion. This month they launch their first British clothing line for high-street stalwart Dorothy Perkins and to celebrate the sisters have been sharing their style secrets. Speaking exclusively to FEMAIL Kim, Kourtney and Khloe explain how they would style their favourite pieces from their eponymous line, the Kardashian Kollection, as well as share the style rules they live by and tell us what they love about each others' looks. Sister act: Kourtney, Kim and Khloe Kardashian model clothes from their Dorothy Perkins line . The siblings have created over 100 larger-than-life pieces for the brand, with a heavy emphasis on the party season, including sequined clutch bags, sparkling tops and, naturally, swathes of dance floor ready dresses. The collection is available from Dorothy Perkins from tomorrow, making it easy to emulate your favourite sister. Love Kourtney's bohemian chic, Kim's red carpet glamour or Khloé's edgy style? Here's how the girls rock their looks: . Kim: 'With my figure, I might belt a looser dress in to create focus on my waist line' What is your favourite piece from the collection? How would you style it three different ways? I absolutely love our sheer spot blouse, which comes in both ivory and black. This blouse is so chic and versatile for any occasion. The polka dot details are divine. and the feminine tailoring is so on trend at the moment. As soon as we could get our hands on the first samples we have been wearing this blouse everywhere! It is perfect for a business meeting with a tight black pencil skirt and simple black pump heels. I would pull my hair into a sleek ponytail or top knot bun and pair with our gold hoops, which I love! It's a great go-to outfit if you need to dress to impress for work. If I was heading to dinner with friends, I could pair the blouse with our cute black shorts, sexy heels or ankle boots and a fabulous little clutch. A statement ring and earrings would definitely complete the look. If it was a little colder, a black blazer is the perfect solution. For more relaxed weekend style, you can pair with leather pants, simple black heels and an oversized statement tote with hair down. What is the one style rule you live by? I always try and buy timeless pieces. I avoid fashion fads that are totally out by the next season. My sisters and I - with our Kardashian Kollection design partner Bruno Schiavi - always look to include timeless trends like lace and leopard print. Are your looks very different? What do you like about each others style? I think we all have a similar appreciation of style. Sometimes we do wear the same things and I love how my sisters can make something look so different. With my figure, I might belt a looser dress in to create focus on my waist line whilst Kourt looks fabulous in it worn loose. Who is the Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl? The girls and women that love fashion and style and are looking for affordable prices to look on trend. Short and sassy: Kim's favourite pieces from the Kardashian Kollection are the sheer spot blouse (£35) and the black shorts with satin trim (£30) Kourtney: 'Have fun with fashion! Life is too short to take it seriously' What is your favourite piece from the collection? How would you style it THREE different ways? I . love our gold sequin jacket - I think it's so stunning . and workable for so many occasions. This is definitely one of my . favourite pieces. I think sequins are fun and add a little boho flair. My . favourite way to wear this jacket is over a simple black top with faux . leather tights. I would definitely wear this to a family dinner with . black ballet flats or out with some suede black thigh high boots. A long . gold necklace would work really well with a fun ring. I think a big . black oversized bag would work best with this outfit. If . you want a way to really make a little black dress stand out then this . jacket is perfect. Add chic black heels and a cool clutch. If . you're looking to add a touch of glam to the perfect daytime lunch . outfit then this sequin blazer looks great with the sleeves rolled up . over a white t shirt and jeans. You can roll up the bottoms of the jeans . or leave them down depending on what works best for your body shape and . pair with great sandals. What is the one style rule you live by? Have . fun with fashion! Life is too short to take it seriously. I am a very . moody dresser...I dress for my moods, so if I'm feeling a like having . some fun, I will throw on a turban to spice things up a little bit. It's . all about how clothes make you feel. Are your looks very different? What do you like about each others style? I'm . definitely more adventurous with my style and am not afraid to go for . bolder colours and prints. I think my sisters are so fashionable in . general and really know how to rock their curvy figures. Kim always . looks stunning in a bodycon dress whilst I love love love a leather look . on Khloe. She can seriously pull off anything, especially with the amazing shoes she always has on. When packing for Miami, I told Kim that . I would most definitely be offending her with my bright colors and . prints, since she is an all black or an all white phase when it comes to . her fashion. Who is the Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl? We . really take inspiration from our fans - what they want, what they like . and what they are looking to spend. They are our Kardashian/Dorothy . Perkins girls because they look to us for style inspiration and we're . excited to finally be able to offer the UK our line. Gold sequin jacket: £50 . Azure top with lace detail: £32 . Blue leopard-print top: £30 . Khloe: 'Always dress for your body! Not every trend works for every body type' What is your favourite piece from the collection? How would you style it three different ways? One . of my favourite pieces of the UK line would be our Gold Bar Bodycon . dress. The dress comes in different colours and prints like leopard . print, green and red, but I can't go past classic black. The dress is . tight fitting with long sleeves and a cut out below the neck highlighted . by a gold bar. It's a super sexy dress, yet also conservative for a . work to dinner look. I am a big fan of long sleeve classy dresses. This . is a huge favourite of mine. The . dress is an ideal purchase in the lead up to holiday season and can be . paired with rocking black heels and classic gold jewelry with a black . clutch for the ultimate night out. This dress is perfect for an event . where you want to look your best and make an impression. For date night or dinner with someone special, throw a chic trench coat . over the dress to keep warm. Our Kardashian Kollection line has a . gorgeous lace trench coat that would go perfectly. Pair with heeled . black ankle boots and wear your hair in a sleek ponytail. I think you . should keep accessories to a minimum with this look. I am an earring . girl so I would personally go towards a basic but fab gold hoop. If . earrings aren't your thing, then keep it simple and wear a statement . ring. For a day time . event where you still need to dress up a little, pair the dress with a . great fitting denim jacket and gorgeous black flat sandals. A black tote . would match the outfit perfectly and help keep all your daytime . essentials with you. What is the one style rule you live by? Always . dress for your body! Not every trend works for every body type. But I . am a strong believer that every woman, no matter her size or age . can incorporate the current trends of the season in to her look. Just . remember to not lose yourself in finding the right way to wear a trend your way. Trendy doesn't mean you can't put your own personal signature . on it.Know the ones that work for you and always accentuate your . assets. Are your looks very different? What do you like about each others style? I . think Kim and I have a similar style whilst Kourt definitely rocks . brighter colours and prints more often. I take a leap out of her book . sometimes and try to work in something really bright like coloured . jeans. We notice our differences in our styles more when we are . designing our collection with Bruno. There are things we all . agree on like leopard print whilst there may be a top that one of us . really likes more than others but we'll keep it in the line because it . suits her style really well. We have learned so much from in our design process. We have learned over the . years that we cannot just design for ourselves. Our consumer is our . voice and that's who we have to focus on. We love constructive criticism . and we love fan feedback. We have always considered ourselves a social . media brand. A brand for our fans and we wholeheartedly respect their . wishes and we fight to give our consumers everything they wish for such . as Kardashian Kurves which is our plus size line in America. Who is the Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl? The Kardashian/Dorothy Perkins girl loves timeless fashion and has a focus on the latest trends. It's . a dream come true to be bringing our Kardashian Kollection line to the . UK because we get to make it accessible to so many more of our fans . through Dorothy Perkins.

"A teacher has been tortured and beheaded by her neighbours in a Papua New Guinea village because they say she was a witch responsible for the death of a sick villager. The angry mob brandishing guns, machetes and axes surrounded her house and pulled Helen Rumbali, her sister and two nieces away. They then burnt down the house. They say a swarm of fire flies led them from the deceased person's grave to her house - sure evidence they say that she was a sorcerer and was practicing black magic. Mobs: Violence is escalating in Papua New Guinea; villagers in February burnt a woman alive, pictured, after accusing her of witch craft . Helen's older sister and younger nieces were slashed with knives, then released after negotiations with police. But the mob went on to torture the former teacher, in her 40s, and then publicly cut off her head. The sickening and heinous act is one of many horrific similar stories coming out from the island, often considered a paradise in the Pacific. In February a young woman was stripped by angry armed villages, tied up and burnt alive. Her crime? Allegedly more black magic. The beautiful tropical island, which was only discovered by the western world in the 1930s, is a complex mix of ancient tribes and western industrial influences, from the gold rush period and more recently, mining. But for tribes people still living by ancient social rules, violence, as opposed to dialogue, is the most common means of problem solving. Speaking to the Mail Online, Dr Nina Rajani, a former Medicines Sans Frontières volunteer who worked in a hospital clinic in Papua New Guinea, said violence was so bad, she was unable to leave her house at night. Violence: Papua New Guinea is rife with violence, in part due to its trial culture. Fights broke out last year during elections and armed guards and police fired shots, pictured . 'Violence is a huge problem out there. Almost every case that came to the hospital A&E department was to do with violence. Whenever there was a disagreement it wasn't verbal, it was always physical; that's how they dealt with things because it's a tribal culture.' Brighton-based GP, Dr Rajani, who helped run a clinic for victims of domestic and sexual violence, said she was aware of the strong belief in sorcery, which was systemic in the local society. She said: 'The guard to our house told me his brother and his brother's friend had been killed by a lightening bolt while playing rugby in a big field. 'He said all the people in the village had gone on a witch hunt to find out who in the village had caused the lightening bolt to kill his brother - they said it was sorcery.' This was typical of village behaviour in the highlands of Papua New Guinea - far from the idyllic and more developed southern tourist resorts. The idea of 'pay-back' is and engrained principle in the local culture. But with the introduction of western consumption, and products such as televisions and branded clothes, there is now even more for the tribes to fight over. Dichotomy: The violence and tribal culture in the highlands of Papua New Guinea are a far cry from the tourist traps in the south of the island . The sickening and heinous act is one of many horrific similar stories coming out from the island, often considered a paradise in the Pacific . While there is a genuine belief among many of the tribes, particularly in the highlands, in sorcery and black magic, experts claim sorcery is used as an excuse for jealousy. Helen Hakena, chairwoman of the North Bougainville Human Rights Committee, which is based in the area Rumbali was killed, told ABC News: 'Jealousy is causing a lot of hatred... People who are so jealous of those who are doing well in life, they resort to what our people believe in, sorcery, to kill them, to stop them continuing their own development.' According to reports, Rumbali's house stood out since it was 'permanent', or built of wood. Her husband and son had government jobs and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing. She said this was 'definitely a case of jealousy' because of her family's position in the village. Attacks of such nature have been reported by the hundreds, according to the United Nations, and are often carried out with impunity. Papua New Guinea lies on the edge  of the Pacific Ocean . For 42 years, the country's Sorcery Act allowed for a belief in black magic to be used as a partial legal defense for killing someone suspected of inflicting harm through sorcery. Only last month, the government repealed the law in response to the recent violence. But black magic alone appears not to be the main cause of such violence; neighbouring Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands also have a strong belief in sorcery, but without the same levels of violence. It appears Papua New Guinea's relative wealth, and subsequent faster economic growth, are to blame. The country has a wealth of mineral resources and natural gas, which has propelled PNG from a   long-stagnant economy into one of the world's fastest growing over the past decade. Economic growth has increased on average almost 7 per cent annually from 2007 to 2010.","Helen Rumbali was dragged from her home tortured and beheaded in public .
Villagers said fire flies led them to her house - a sign she was a witch .
They accused her of killing another villager - who died from sickness - with her sorcery .
Experts say disparity in wealth and jealousy are main reasons for increases in such attacks ."
"A graduate who stood in Waterloo Station and advertised his skills to commuters is now one step closer to landing his dream job. Alfred Ajani, 22, received widespread praise after ditching online application forms and handing out his CV to businessmen and women passing through the busy London terminal. His radical approach to job-hunting has now paid off and he told today how he could now be on his way to Barcelona. Scroll down for video . Determined job seeker Alfred Ajani is approached by a businessman yesterday after advertising himself during rush hour at London's Waterloo Station . He later tweeted a photo of his phone to show how busy he had been, with the message: 'I did alright' Alfred took to the station concourse early yesterday morning and, after some commuters looked at him in surprise, many stopped to speak about potential positions. After being inundated with emails and calls, the marketing graduate from Coventry University has now had an interview with sports hospitality firm THG Sports. He said: 'The response has been incredible. I've even had to have my family and friends help me go through all the emails and phone messages I've received. 'I've spoken to THG about a sales position in Barcelona, which would be a brilliant as it is in the area I want to go into and studied. 'Living abroad would be a great experience too, so it's something I'm really excited about.' Since graduating in May, Alfred had applied for 300 positions in the crowded graduate jobs market without success and so decided to take a more direct approach to finding work. After his success yesterday, he said: 'My mum, Lola, is really proud of me. She gave me a big hug when she saw the response I had got. And she had me up at 5.30am this morning following up some of the offers I have received.' Alfred had applied for 300 positions since graduating, without success, so decided to try a different approach . Thousands of commuters pile through Waterloo every morning on their way to business hub, the City of London . Alfred is still waiting to hear back from some of people who took his details yesterday, but is optimistic he will find a job and is encouraging others to follow his lead. After posting a picture of all the messages he had on his phone, he tweeted: 'Battery is on 17%. Few opportunities look to be coming my way. Would advise recent graduates to do what I did' Statistics show that almost half of recent graduates are now in so-called 'non-graduate' or 'stepping stone' roles, such as bar-tending, and are struggling to get the positions they had hoped for. However, a recent poll of companies suggests the situation is now improving, with a 17 per cent increase in graduate roles expected this year.","Alfred Ajani was one of thousands of graduates struggling to find work .

"It’s said that Rome wasn’t built in a day, but it seems that an entire city can be built from scratch in two years – in Minecraft, at least. The popular video game, which may look to some like it was created in the 1980s, allows people to build any structure they can imagine using tiny virtual blocks. Duncan Parcells, an art student at the University of Delaware, used 4.5 million blocks to create a metropolis resembling a scene from Sim City. Scroll down for videos .

Minecraft was created by Markus Persson in 2009, before releasing it widely in November 2011. Players of the game, which is available on PC and Xbox can walk around different terrains, fly and build models using little pixelated blocks. It's the top online game on Xbox Live, with over two billion hours played on Xbox 360 in the last two years - and almost 17 million copies sold in total. Last month, Microsoft snapped up Mr Persson's company, Mojang - and the game - for an estimated $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). There is an annual Minecraft convention - Minecon - which is set to continue. Mr Persson will leave his company when the deal is finalised to conduct 'small web experiments'. He said the decision to sell the company was 'not about the money. It's about my sanity.' Now that he has a copy for his computer, he is going to move his creation permanently onto the PC so he can continue building at a faster rate.

"One of the country's biggest universities has suspended all Greek activities after a young man died following a night out at a fraternity house. Nolan Burch of Buffalo, New York, a freshman at West Virginia University, was found not breathing and without a pulse at the Kappa Sigma house around midnight on Wednesday. He was pronounced dead on Friday afternoon. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Nolan Burch (above) a freshman at West Virginia University, was found without a pulse and not breathing earlier this week, and pronounced dead on Friday . Shut it down: The incident, which occurred at the Kappa Sigma house (above), has now resulted in West Virginia University suspending all Greek life activities . Tweet: Burch tweeted his excitement for the night (above) just hours before he was found . Just a few hours before he was found not breathing on Wednesday, Burch wrote on Twitter, 'It's about to be a very eventful night to say the least.' 'Words cannot describe the heartache we, as a West Virginia University family, feel at the loss of one of our own – Nolan Michael Burch – who passed away today,' said the university's President E. Gordon Gee in a statement. 'The outpouring of love and support from his friends and this community has been what you would expect from Mountaineers, and I would ask that you continue to keep the Burch family and many friends in your thoughts and prayers.' Now, West Virginia University has suspended all fraternity and sorority events as of Thursday.after what they are calling a 'catastrophic medical emergency.' The incident also happened just one week after 19 intoxicated pledges from the Sigma Chi fraternity were arrested after participating in a street brawl. Those students initially told authorities they were part of a rival fraternity, and now might be facing obstruction of justice charges in addition to underage possession of alcohol and assault. Unknown: Officials are still not sure what caused Burch's death, seen above in the middle with friends . Shock: A member of Burch's family said she was 'shocked' at what happened, speculating that it may have been the result of a fraternity hazing . As for Burch, his family cannot believe what has happened. 'These things shouldn't happen,' his aunt, Joyce Stamp, told NBC News. 'He's only 18. He's a nice young man and I'm shocked.' She then added, 'But he's a freshman and even very intelligent kids sometimes get caught up. You hear all the stuff about hazing, and this is first time away from home.' Brawl: 19 members of another fraternity, Sigma Chi (members seen above from last year) were arrested following a street fight last week . 'The action to halt fraternity and sorority activities while these matters are being reviewed is being done with the well-being and safety of our students in mind,' said Corey Farris, West Virginia University's dean of students. 'That is — and must always be — our foremost priority' West Virginia is the second school to suspend Greek activities in just this week, with Johns Hopkins doing the same following claims a 16-year-old girl was raped in a bathroom during a party at a fraternity house.","West Virginia University has suspended all Greek life on campus after what they are calling a 'catastrophic medical emergency'

"Secretary: The official documents reveal Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was a civilian detainee who worked as a secretary. As he was not considered a terror threat, he was released 10 months later . The bloodthirsty leader of the Islamic State  was once a secretary working in office admin, newly released documents have revealed. Brutal Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was captured by American soldiers in 2004 in Iraq, and records from the time have revealed his life before he turned to terror. The declassified documents show that al-Baghdadi - registered under his real name of Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Al Badr - was held for 10 months in a military prison in the south of the country. The terrorist's status was listed as 'civilian detainee', which means he was not then officially thought to be an insurgent. His occupation was written as 'Administrative Work (Secretary)'. He was registered as married, and an uncle is listed as being his next of kin - although all of his relatives' names have been redacted. It is believed he was detained during a raid aimed at arresting his friend, named as Nessayif Numan Nessayif, in Fallujah. The records, obtained by Business Insider, were released through a Freedom of Information Act request. Although his date of birth is also redacted, he is believed to be 43-years old-and has a wife and a young son. Friends of al-Baghdadi have previously told of how he was a talented footballer, with one former team-mate even describing him as the 'Lionel Messi of our team'. He was also remembered as a shy and unassuming young man who was interested in religious studies, before his radicalisation to a dangerous extremist. Scroll down for video . Since rising to power within the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi's brutal thugs have shocked the world with their sadistic and savage murder of thousands of people in Iraq, Syria and Libya. The terror group - believed to have more than 30,000 soldiers - have revelled in posting graphic images and videos of murders including beheadings and burning victims alive. There is a $10 million bounty on al-Baghdadi's head after the US State Department listed him as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist'. Transformation: Since announcing himself as leader of the Islamic State, al-Baghdadi's bloodthirsty thugs have carried out thousands of brutal executions in the region . He was seen publicly in a slick propaganda video last July for the first time in years, sporting a long beard and black robes to deliver a sermon. Speaking in Mosul's central Mosque, al-Baghdadi announced that the lands his group had conquered were now part of the new Islamic State and announced himself as the 'caliph' or leader. Under his leadership, ISIS has spearheaded a militant offensive that has overrun much of Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland since June after seizing major territory in neighbouring Syria, and carried out a series of atrocities in both countries. During their domination in the area, the group have been pegged back in recent weeks due to a series of air strikes which have resulted in deaths and the loss of important strategic locations. It was rumored that he was killed or wounded by a US airstrike last November, but the group moved to quash this by releasing an audio recording purporting to be him, in which he encouraged militants to attack Saudi Arabia.","Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was captured by American soldiers in 2004 in Iraq .

"A former NBA player has been charged with a gun crime after a police raid on the house of an alleged drug-dealer where he was staying uncovered heroin, meth, guns, a grenade launcher and several prostitutes. Robert Swift, 28, who joined the Seattle Sonics straight out of high school, has been described as a ’heavily armed heroin addict’ by prosecutors in King Country, Washington. Police raided the property last month, and seized a number of weapons from Swift’s bedroom, including a military-style grenade launcher and sawed-off shotgun. Fallen star: Robert Swift (pictured in 2006) has been charged with unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, after police raided the home of an alleged drug dealer where Swift was living . Arsenal: Recovered weapons from the October 4 bust. Prosecutors describe Swift, 28, as a heavily armed heroin addict who admitted to helping his drug dealer-turned-roommate collect a drug debt. That man, 54-year-old Trygve Bjorkstam, is accused of amassing an 18-gun arsenal to protect his drug business . On Thursday, Swift was charged Thursday with unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, after police found seven firearms on or under his bed and a 40mm grenade launcher in a safe in his room, in addition to the sawed-off shotgun, KOMO News reports. Swift denied involvement in dealing the drugs, but admitted to having drug paraphernelia in his bedroom, and claimed several suppressors and weapons as his property. The fallen star has been living with the owner of the house, Trygve Bjorkstam, 54, who Swift told police is his heroin dealer, since he was kicked out of his foreclosured home in suburban Seattle last year. Mr Bjorkstam, who faces federal drug and gun charges after running his illegal business – which included housing prostitutes and an underground bunker used as a marijuana grow and a shooting range – 100 yards from an elementary school, told police Swift was a ’good guy’ who was helping him collect a drug debt from a competitor. Swift has been ordered held on $20,000 bail. He has no criminal history. Tragic: Swift (pictured in 2006) was drafted straight out of high school, but had not played professionally since 2011, and admitted to police that he was addicted to heroin and using it daily . Wasted talent: Swift had been living with  Trygve Bjorkstam, 54, who Swift says is his heroin dealer, since he was kicked out of his foreclosured home in suburban Seattle (pictured) in 2013 . This is only the latest chapter in the sad saga of the fall of Robert Swift , who was plucked straight out of high school to play NBA basketball at the age of 18, and was a number one draft pick for the Sonics in 2004. Earning multi-million dollar salaries, he played for Seattle and Oklahoma City, who renounced their rights to Swift in December 2009. He attempted a comeback in Japan the following year with the Tokyo Apaches, but the team was dissolved after the 2011 Tsunami. Last year, MailOnline reported how Swift was kicked out of his home in upmarket Seattle suburb of Sammamish, which he had for $1.35million in 2006. The house went into foreclosure after Swift was found to owe $168,000 on his mortgage despite earning $20m during his career. Despite the house being sold to new owners in February 2013, Swift refused to move out and squatted in  in squalor, before finally being kicked out in March. Pictured is Swift's former home, which was completely destroyed and squalid when the new owners moved in . Swift's former home(pictured in 2013)  showed evidence of Swift having a drinking problem, with beer and spirits bottles lying around in and around the property among his personal possessions, dog faeces and litter . When the new owners, Mr and Mrs Dalzell finally got into their new home, they were horrified by what they saw. Everywhere were bottles of alcohol and prescription drugs, multiple weapons and live ammunition scattered around and the basement had been turned into a makeshift shooting range. The garden was littered with empty beer cans,a garage window had a bullet hole in it and out the front was a car and a pick up truck with no engine. Perhaps the most poignant items of all were Swift’s personal possessions which showed the life he once had - letters and photos from his once promising career. Mr Dalzell told MailOnline: ‘There must have been more than 100 pizza boxes strewn everywhere. I counted thousands of liquor bottles too - vodka, Dom Perignon, Crystal, and one bottle of King Louis XIII cognac. ‘There were maggots in the sink and a five gallon drum you would normally use for cooling water was full of urine. ‘The pile of animal feces on the deck was about 1ft high. We’re talking 100lbs of dog crap. It had been piled up with a shovel and looked like it had been tended to then let go wild’. Mr Dalzell said that he has spent $5,000 cleaning up the house and that it took four dumpsters to get all the mess out.","Robert Swift, 28, charged with unlawful possession of a shotgun .

"Supporter: Alan Duncan MP said the couple should have a right to defend their property . A government minister has issued an impassioned defence of two of his constituents, saying they should not be prosecuted for shooting two suspected burglars who allegedly broke into their remote farm cottage. International Development Minister Alan Duncan, who is MP for Rutland and Melton, spoke out in support of homeowners Andy Ferrie, 35, and his wife Tracey, 43. The couple were arrested in the early hours of Sunday after they were disturbed by the break-in at their home in the Welby area of Leicestershire, near Melton Mowbray. They are presently being questioned by Leicestershire Police on suspicion of GBH. It is understood Mr Ferrie grabbed a legally-owned shotgun and fired at two of the four intruders before calling the police himself. Minister Mr Duncan said the Ferries should not face charges for defending their home. 'If this is a straightforward case of someone using a shotgun to defend themselves against burglars in the dead of night, then I would hope that the police will prosecute the burglars and not my constituents,' he said. 'The householder is the victim here and justice should support them and prosecute the burglars.' Mr and Mrs Ferrie have reportedly been burgled three or four times at their 200-year-old farm cottage. Police investigation: Forensic officers arrive at the house where Andy and Tracey Ferrie were arrested . The couple had only been back in the property for four weeks - after moving out because they were fed up with being targeted - when crooks struck again. Mr Ferrie's stepfather Maris Spilner, 60, said the couple, who have been married for four years, had decided to emigrate to Australia in 2013. The service engineer said: 'In the time they have lived in the cottage, I think they have been broken into a couple of times at least, but I couldn’t say for definite. 'This is very out of character, we were very shocked when we heard on Sunday. 'But if someone breaks into your home its a violation of your privacy, I’m sure there was a very good reason for what has happened. 'We don’t know what went on, we haven’t spoken to either of them since it happened and no one will tell us anything. 'They haven’t lived in the property again for that long - a few months maybe. 'They were preparing for their move overseas, they were hoping to emigrate to Australia - for the weather mainly.' Mr Spilner confirmed that the couple did have a gun licence but could not confirm for what type of firearm. He said: 'They weren’t part of any gun club that I am aware of, but they did have a gun license. 'I have never seen the firearm.' Analysis: Leicestershire Police cordoned off the stone cottage, which had reportedly been burgled several times already . Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie . The couple - who have not been officially identified by police - run a caravan and motor home firm in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. They are being questioned by Leicestersire police today. The Ferries are believed to have called the police immediately after the latest burglary at 12.26am on Sunday morning. It is understood that the man who dialled 999 told officers he had fired his shotgun, which is licensed and legally held, and that the intruders fled. Police examine a shotgun after attending reports of a shooting at the 200-year-old property . Shortly after police received the emergency call they were alerted by the ambulance service that they had been called to the same address to treat a man with shotgun injuries. The two wounded men, whose injuries are not life-threatening, were allegedly part of a four-man burglary team. The four suspected burglars, aged 23, 27, 31, and 33, were all arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary where the injured pair were taken for treatment. Police said they could not comment on whether the raiders had been armed. Mr and Mrs Ferrie were held after suspected burglars were shot at their home . Police stand at the front door of the property as they attend the scene of the shooting at Melton Mowbray . Detectives and scenes of crime officers have cordoned off the stone cottage, and forensic investigations are underway. Eve Hobill, whose family owns the land that the cottage is on, said today: 'We do not know what is happening, and we are not allowed to say anything.' A police community support officer stands guard at a track near the isolated cottage . Local resident Ted Hutchin, 63, said the suspected break-in and shooting were a shock to the quiet, rural community. He said: ‘I’m a former magistrate and Melton Mowbray has the usual crimes associated with a market town. ‘But in the immediate vicinity the worst crime we can remember is lead stolen from the church roof.’ Mr Hutchin said he had seen the police cordon outside the cottage on his way to church last night, adding: ‘I thought it was strange because this is such a quiet spot.’ The case is likely to reignite public debate over a householder’s right to defend his home against intruders. In 1999, Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was arrested after shooting burglars during a break-in at his remote farmhouse. He did not have a firearms licence. Fred Barras, 16, was killed and his friend Brendan Fearon, 29, suffered gunshot wounds to his legs. Fearon later admitted conspiring to burgle the farmhouse, accompanied by Barras, but Martin was tried at Norwich Crown Court and jailed for life for murder in 2000. His murder conviction was later reduced to manslaughter and he was released from jail in 2003. The four suspected burglars, aged 23, 27, 31, and 33, were all arrested at Leicester Royal Infirmary . Melton Mowbray was described by residents as a quiet, rural community .

"The warning was issued by chief schools inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw (above), who said thousands of disadvantaged pupils are being ignored by the education system . Outstanding schools in leafy suburbs and other affluent areas will be stripped of their status unless they do more to help deprived children. The warning was issued by chief schools inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said thousands of disadvantaged pupils - an ‘invisible minority’ - are being ignored by the education system. It means over-subscribed schools that are otherwise deemed highly successful by inspectors could be downgraded to ‘good’ or even ‘requires improvement’ - the third lowest of four ratings. The Ofsted boss accused them of ‘complacency’ by focusing on more able students while cultivating ‘low expectations’ in others. Inspectors would ‘visit and revisit’ them until there was improvement, he warned. Sir Michael said under-achievement was no longer a problem among ethnic minorities in inner-cities. Instead, it is now most pronounced among white working class boys and girls - who make up two-thirds of all schoolchildren receiving free school meals (FSM), a key indicator of deprivation. Most of these under-performing pupils are in suburbs, market towns and seaside resorts where they are being let down by ‘timid’ school leaders and local authorities. ‘Often they are spread thinly, as an “invisible minority” across areas that are relatively affluent,’ he said. ‘These poor, unseen children can be found in mediocre schools the length and breadth of our country. They are labelled, buried in lower sets, consigned as often as not to indifferent teaching. ‘They coast through education until, at the earliest opportunity, they sever their ties with it.’ In a radio interview earlier in the day he confirmed top schools were also letting pupils down. ‘The problems now are in schools, good schools, outstanding schools, in county areas, with small proportions of poor children that are doing extremely badly,’ he said. He singled out West Berkshire, which has the worst record for pupil attainment in the whole country at primary level. The area, which includes Wokingham and Newbury, is also second worst for secondary schools and in the bottom three local authorities for qualifications at 19. Sir Michael said under-achievement was no longer a problem among ethnic minorities in inner-cities. Instead, it is now most pronounced among white working class boys and girls - who make up two-thirds of all schoolchildren receiving free school meals, a key indicator of deprivation . Other prosperous parts of the country that need improvement include Norwich, Hastings, Shropshire and Herefordshire. Sir Michael’s speech accompanied a report, Unseen Children: Access and Achievement, which revealed 15 local authorities where only a quarter of children on FSM achieved five good GCSEs. Nationally, 59 per cent of children reach that level, compared to 36 per cent on FSM. The former headteacher set out eight recommendations to close the gap, including removing a school’s outstanding rating if FSM pupils fall significantly behind others and increasing the number of inspections it has. Even those with small numbers of deprived pupils would be affected. He also called for top teachers and heads to be centrally employed as National Service Teachers who could be parachuted into failing schools or areas. In return, they would receive large pay rises and promotions would be fast-tracked. Regional schemes where excellent headteachers would share their expertise with less successful schools were also needed, he said, and assessments of reception year pupils and post-16 students should be extended. ‘There are stark consequences for our nation if we do not act with sufficient urgency,’ Sir Michael added. ‘We will continue to lose our place as a competitive nation and hear great economic costs of failure.’ Ofsted has produced the reports every ten years since 1993 but the next report will now be produced in 2018. Unions welcomed the focus on children from deprived backgrounds but questioned the chief inspector’s conclusions. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: ‘Ofsted’s repeated fault-finding and insinuation that the challenges faced by the education system are largely the result of teachers’ low expectations for their pupils are wholly unjustified.’ Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg said Labour would ‘ensure all schools work together to raise standards for every child’. The Coalition government has introduced the pupil premium - an extra payment to schools per pupil on FSM - to close the achievement gap. The Department for Education said it would be looking at the recommendations.","Warning was issued by chief schools inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw .

"Surgeons in Los Angeles have for the first time performed a life-saving procedure on a tiny foetus inside its mother's womb after practising on a grape. Using a hair-fine wire, a miniature needle, a tiny balloon and a catheter they successfully carried out the operation on the unborn child's heart - which is about the size of a walnut. It was a medical first for the surgical team at CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, in Los Angeles, and according to the LA Times, it appears to have been a success. Scroll down for video . Life-saving surgery: Surgeons in LA have expanded an aortic valve in the heart of an unborn child possibly saving its life . Delicate procedure: A video of the operation shows the tiny needle, left, carefully entering the beating heart, which is darker . The foetal heart was developing with one valve too narrow, a condition known as severe aortic stenosis. This meant the amount of blood coming into the heart was being severely restricted and it was backing up in the left ventricle. Without the surgery, the child would likely have be born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) - a life-threatening condition. Quoted in the LA news service, Dr Ramen Chmait, assistant professor at Keck School of Medicine of USC and director of LA Fetal Therapy, said: 'There is no question in my mind that without this procedure the baby would have had HLHS. 'Now the baby has a chance to have the left ventricle recover with some good function.' The footage shows the needle pull back and stop when it reaches the exact point of the foetus's aortic valve, where a catheter is to be inserted to expand it . Practising for such a critical and exacting procedure, remarkably, involved using a jelly mould to replicate the mother's body, and a single grape representing the foetal heart. A team of specialists carried out the nerve-wracking operation on September 25. The mother was given a local anaesthetic and the foetus was also given anaesthesia and a muscle relaxant so it would not move in the mother's womb during the operation, the LA Times said. Video of the procedure shows the tiny needle being slowly inserted into the beating heart up until the exact point of the narrow aortic valve. This part of the procedure was performed by Dr Chmait. Next, paediatric interventional cardiologist Dr Frank Ing, of CHLA, threaded a micro-wire, the same width as a hair, through a tiny hole running inside the length of the needle. The procedure was a medical first for the team at CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, in Los Angeles, pictured, and the first time it has been performed in Southern Claifornia . A tiny aortic balloon attached to a catheter was passed down along the wire and inflated to a width of 3.25mm, the LA Times said, stretching and even tearing the narrow aortic valve. The balloon, wire and needle were then all removed, leaving the catheter in place. The surgeons said immediately after the insertion of the catheter, more blood was flowing into the foetal heart. The procedure was a first for Southern California. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust hospital, in London, was the first to carry out the procedure, at its Evelina London Children’s Hospital, in 1989.

"Sweden has confirmed that a small foreign submarine illegally entered its waters off the coast of Stockholm last month. Military officials said the nationality of the intruders can not be confirmed, but several  defense analysts say Russia remains the likely culprit. Russian media has in turn responded by claiming that it was a NATO submarine, and accusing the Swedes of cowardice and deliberately keeping the nationality a secret. Proof: An image of the seabed off the coast of Stockholm which was provided as evidence of foreign submarine activity at today's press conference . The Swedish Armed Forces' Commander-in-chief Sverker Göranson confirmed the violation during a press conference this morning, held with Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist. 'The Swedish Armed forces can now confirm that a smaller submarine violated Swedish territory,' Göranson said. 'There is no doubt about this. We can rule out all other alternative explanations.' Göranson added that the government is 'one-hundred per cent sure' of the violation, which he calls 'deeply serious'. 'It's impossible to confirm any nationality. But we can confirm the fact that it has been there,' Göranson said. Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Löfven, Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist, and The Swedish Armed Forces' Commander-in-chief Sverker Göranson arrive for a news conference in Stockholm where they confirmed that a small foreign submarine illegally entered its waters last month . Is this it? This grainy amateur photo showing a mysterious vessel in Stockholm's archipelago was released by the Swedish military during the hunt, the captions bottom right reads: 'Object moves at speed through the water. Bearing south. Heavy self-generated foaming' Prime Minister Löfven warned that such incursions into Swedish territory presented 'enormous risks' for those involved and that Sweden would defend its borders 'with all available means'. Should a nationality be confirmed at any point, it will be a major test for Mr Löfven, a former welder who has never even sat in parliament before becoming prime minister, and his Social Democrat-Green Party coalition government. During the week-long hunt for the intruders, it was reported to have been a Russian intrusion into Swedish waters, and several defense experts maintain that this is the case. Today, former foreign minister Carl Bildt made a thinly veiled hint at Russian responsibility, by tweeting: 'Swedish Armed Forces can’t identify nationality of intruding submarine. Looks like small green subs' The 'small green subs' refers to the Russian annexation of Crimea, which began with 'green men' landing on the Ukrainian peninsula. The leader of the Swedish Liberal Party, Jan Bjorklund, went even further, telling Aftonbladet, that there could be no other conclusion than that Russia was responsible. Russian media was quick to hit back, with pro-Putin newspaper Rossijskaja Gazeta accusing NATO of being responsible for the intrusion, and the Swedish military of keeping schtum about it. 'So it is about their own - NATO. But to say that means admitting that the Russians are not responsible. 'But the Swedish military is clearly not able to take such a manly step. This is why Mr Göranson acts as if he had water in his mouth [a Russian saying meaning 'clamming up'] . Any other logical explanation to his inability to announce which country the submarine was from, clearly does not exist,' writes Rossijskaja Gazeta. Under attack: Although he Swedish government has confirmed an illegal breach of Swedish borders, the nationality of the vessel cannot be confirmed . Armed and ready: Prime Minister Löfven said Sweden would defend its borders 'with all available means' Göranson said the military obtained evidence of the intrusion with its own sensors,and provided images of the seabed where trails left by the submarine could be seen. Löfven noted that Sweden's coastline is as long as the U.S. East Coast, making it difficult to monitor, but promised to strengthen the country's ability to find and identify intruders. 'Let me say this, loud and clear, to those who are responsible: It is completely unacceptable,' Löfven said. The Scandinavian country launched its biggest submarine hunt since the Cold War on October 17, after receiving eyewitness reports of 'underwater activity' in the archipelago that extends from Stockholm into the Baltic Sea. The week-long hunt has involved more than 200 troops, stealth ships and helicopters but the military called it off after concluding that the vessel had probably escaped into the Baltic. The military said then that it was likely that a foreign . submarine or divers had been active in the archipelago, but fell . short of concluding that there was absolute proof of an . intrusion into Swedish water. Sweden built up an anti-submarine force after a Soviet sub with nuclear weapons ran aground off its southern shores in 1981, but started dismantling the force as part of deep cuts in defense spending after the Cold War ended. Anti-submarine helicopters were phased out in 2008 and replacements are not expected until 2018.","Foreign submarine violated Swedish borders, government confirms .

"A college football star has been accused of brutally beating a 66-year-old man before leaving him to die in the street. Beau Smith, 22, a wide receiver for Williamette University, appeared in Marion County Circuit Court in Oregon on Thursday, accused of murdering Michael Hampshire, a retired airplane mechanic. A passerby found Hampshire's body at an intersection just two blocks from the man's home at 3.42am on Wednesday. When police arrived, they declared him dead. Pastor Dallas Yetter said Hampshire often took walks in the night when he had trouble sleeping and said he believes the man fell victim to a random attack. Scroll down for video . 'Fight': Beau Smith, 22, left, has been arrested in the murder of 66-year-old Michael Hampshire, right, who was found dead from blunt-force trauma in the street early on Wednesday morning . In court: Smith, who is from California, appeared in Marion County Circuit Court in Oregon on Thursday . 'I don't know anything about Beau Smith,' Yetter told the Statesman Journal. 'My guess is it was a random beating... Something took place that wasn't right there. It's just a shock, and sad.' After the body was found, a man covered in blood - believed to be Smith - waved down a patrolman a few blocks away, raised his arms and said, 'I need help, I was in a fight', sources told CBS. The Willamette senior and chemistry major, who is from Roseville, California, was taken in to custody and is being held on a charge of murder. It is unclear whether a weapon was used but the medical examiner concluded that Hampshire died of blunt force injuries to the head. Top student: Smith, a chemistry major at Willamette University, had a 4.0 GPA in high school . Marion County District Attorney Doug Hanson told the Sacramento Bee that officials are still investigating what happened but they have no reason to believe the two men knew each other. Hampshire's neighbors said they don't recognize Smith and a university spokesperson said Hampshire had no affiliation with the school. The university released a statement saying they are cooperating fully with the investigation and they have started their own student conduct investigation. They would not say whether Smith is still considered an enrolled student. Smith's attorney said he may enter a plea when he next appears in court, on December 11. He has been denied bail, in accordance with Oregon law. Before the next appearance, his attorney is working on providing evidence to the state that Smith is a strong student and athlete, as well as character references. The student was in the top five per cent of his high school graduating class in Roseville and had a 4.0-plus grade point average, according to the Sacramento Bee. He then moved to Oregon to attend Williamete, where he played for the Bearcats - first as free safety and tight end before playing as wife receiver. The school's athletic records show he caught four touchdowns and 17 passes last year. 'He was never in trouble,' Former Roseville High Principal Brad Basham said. He said the fact that the young man has been arrested for murder is 'almost unbelievable'. Team: Smith (80, right) played wide receiver for the Bearcats. The university is also investigating his conduct . Scene: Hampshire's body was found by a passerby just blocks from his home on Wednesday morning . Hampshire was remembered as a friendly neighbor who volunteered at a food share and enjoyed working on remodeling projects at his home. Oregon Department of Corrections records show he had completed probation in 2013 for menacing, the Bee reported. He lived alone with his dog after he and his wife separated a few years ago, his pastor told the Stateman Journal. 'He would catch me out in the yard working and just come over and talk,' Yetter said. 'He liked working with his hands. He was innovative and liked to try new things. He liked a challenge.'

"The Rolling Stones have settled their   multimillion-pound  claim with insurers over a number of cancelled shows - but say they are 'deeply upset' about confidential details entering the public domain. It has been revealed their insurance policy did not cover Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods for 'alcohol abuse'. Richards was also not covered in case of 'liver failure and/or disease and osteoarthritis' or for any condition related to a fall he had from a coconut tree in Fiji in 2006 - which resulted in brain surgery. Insurance underwriters had contested their liability to meet the costs incurred after the cancellation of concerts following the death of frontman Sir Mick Jagger's girlfriend L'Wren Scott. Court documents filed in the US over legal action stemming from the claim suggested the singer suffered 'acute traumatic stress disorder' after Miss Scott's suicide. Scroll down for video . L'Wren Scott's death prompted the Rolling Stones to postpone a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand. Pictured are Mr Jagger and Miss Scott together in June 2013 . It has been revealed the band's insurance policy did not cover Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods, pictured performing in June this year, for 'alcohol abuse' A spokesman for Mick Jagger (pictured left with Miss Scott in 2012 and right during a June performance) said he was 'deeply upset' private medical information had made its way into the public domain . The Stones are said to have taken out a £15 million insurance policy in case of any shows being cancelled due to the death of family members. But today representatives for the group said both sides had 'settled the insurance claim'. There were concerns among the Stones' team about private information about the group and their families being brought into the public eye without their knowledge. A spokesman for Mr Jagger said: 'We are deeply upset that confidential medical and other private information about members of the band and their immediate family and loved ones has entered the public domain as a result of a US court filing initiated by insurers four weeks ago. 'This was done without the knowledge of the band or reference to their legal representatives. 'This has only been discovered and reported in the press in the last week, by which time we are pleased to say the insurers and the Rolling Stones had, in fact, settled the insurance claim. Rolling Stones band members Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood enjoy a day off performing as they relax on a boat in Sydney Harbour with family and friends . 'No further comment will be made about this matter.' A spokesman for the band failed to point this out this week despite repeated requests for comment, claiming it was an ‘ongoing legal action’. No details about the settlement were released. Veteran rock act the Stones postponed a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand after Miss Scott's death earlier this year and filed an £8 million claim for losses. The lawsuit gave an unprecedented glimpse into the band’s finances and revealed they would rake in £63 million from their tour. The court documents, reported by the Salt Lake Tribune earlier this week, included claims that Mr Jagger was advised not to perform for at least 30 days after his 49-year-old girlfriend was found dead in her New York apartment in March. The underwriters were said to have disputed the insurance claim on the basis that Miss Scott may have been suffering from a mental illness, meaning her death may not be covered by the policy. They said that Miss Scott’s suicide at the age of 49 was not beyond her control and was foreseeable as she suffered from mental issues. It also requested information to find out if Miss Scott attempted suicide or self harmed in the past. In July, Mr Jagger spoke to NBC's Today show about how he was coping in the aftermath of her death. 'I'm doing OK. It's difficult, you know, a very hard year,' he said. The veteran rockers' lawyers have settled their dispute with insurance underwriters after tour dates last year were cancelled following the death of Mick Jagger's girlfriend L'Wren Scott . The rocker said he had received 'a lot of support' from friends and family in the wake of the tragedy, adding: 'I appreciate that.' He had been in a relationship with Miss Scott for 13 years. She was a red carpet favourite, with her dresses worn by Hollywood stars including Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz. But she reportedly owed nearly £4.6 million to creditors at the time of her death. In a statement shortly after her death, he wrote: 'I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. 'We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.' At the weekend the Rolling Stones were forced to cancel a performance in Melbourne, during their latest tour which includes a number of dates rescheduled after Miss Scott's death. The tour's promoter said Mr Jagger was 'under strict doctor's orders to rest his vocal cords for the next few days in order to recuperate for the remainder of the tour'.","Rolling Stones settle multimillion-pound claim with concert insurers .

"Despite years of coaching youth football in Indianapolis, John Padgett had never walked away with the top prize: the coveted Washington Township Football League championship. But just four days before he lost his lengthy battle with cancer, the 48-year-old coach watched with joy as his fifth and sixth grade team took the title - winning his version of the Super Bowl. And just nine hours before he passed away, the 18 youngsters took their celebrations from a local elementary school to his bedside, knowing that it wouldn't be the same without him. The coach, a married father, passed away on Sunday night at his home in Indianapolis just hours before the boys said their goodbyes, the Indy Star reported. Loved: John Padgett, a youth football coach from Indiana, passed away after living long enough to watch his team take the championship title. He is pictured with one of the boys, Connor Essick, at the game . 'I'm just so thankful to the boys,' his wife Debra said. 'Because I know – I really believe – I got some extra time with John because he wanted to see the season through, and he wanted to go to that Super Bowl party.' Padgett was diagnosed with lymphoma in his lungs last year and had part of his left lung removed, but by April doctors saw it had spread to his lymph system and gave him just months to live. He underwent repeated rounds of chemotherapy and always made it to the games, even though, by the end, he couldn't walk and struggled to breathe. By the time the boys took their pizza party to his hospital bed at his home last weekend, their coach could no longer speak or open his eyes. Proud: Coach Padgett (pictured back, center) is pictured alongside his team of fifth and sixth graders, who took their celebrations to his bedside on Sunday when he was too ill to attend . Family: His wife Debbie, pictured together left, said she believes her husband lived long enough to watch the boys win and celebrate with them. He is pictured right with their adopted son, Darian . But assistant coach Mark Zinn said he is sure Padgett knew they were there, because when he held his hand and told him he was an amazing man, Zinn felt Padgett's hand squeezing his. 'I about lost it,' Zinn told the Indy Star. Padgett, a graphics designer, leaves behind his wife Debbie, 52, and their son Darian. The couple, who learned after their married that they couldn't have children, adopted Darian after Debbie met him at Ernie Pyle Elementary, where she taught the second grade. She became aware of the little boy because he kept on stealing breakfast, and she soon learned that he was in the foster system. She went home and told her husband that they needed to adopt the boy and - without even meeting him - Padgett agreed. When Darian joined the family, he asked his dad to play football with him, and Padgett signed him up for the Washington Township Football League and joined as coach. But even after his son grew out of the team, Padgett continued coaching the kids. Still smiling: Padgett, pictured in hospital, even missed an Alice Cooper concert because he didn't have enough energy to go to both the show and his team's semifinal - so he chose his team . Friends paid tribute to the beloved coach, who always put the kids first. They remembered how he skipped an Alice Cooper concert - his favorite musician - to see his team's semi-final earlier this month. The boys are now planning to be there for their coach, attending his funeral on Friday wearing their jerseys, each with the name 'Padgett' across the back. 'He was dying, but he faced it,' Zinn said. 'John got right in cancer's face and said, ""You're not going to beat me. You might win, but you're not going to beat me"".'","John Padgett, 48, passed away last Sunday at his home in Indianapolis .

"A Middle Tennessee freshman who finished five years of active service in the Marines this summer is appealing an NCAA rule preventing him from playing this season because he played in a recreational league in the military. According to The Daily News Journal, the rule essentially says student-athletes who do not enroll in college within a year of graduating high school will be charged one year of collegiate eligibility for every academic year they participate in organized competition. By NCAA standards, Steven Rhodes' play at the Marine base counted as ""organized competition"" because there were game officials, team uniforms and the score was kept. Fighting his corner: Marine and MTSU walk-on freshman Steven Rhodes hopes to be granted immediate eligibility by the NCAA to play this season . Sitting on the sidelines: Steven Rhodes is not able to play college football this year because he competed in a recreational league during his tenure as a Marine . But the 6-foot-3, 240-pound Marine sergeant said the recreational league was nothing close to organized. 'Man, it was like intramurals for us,' said the 24-year-old. 'There were guys out there anywhere from 18 to 40-something years old. The games were spread out. We once went six weeks between games.' The rule first took shape in 1980, when 'participation in organized competition during times spent in the armed services, on official church missions or with recognized foreign aid services of the U.S. government' were exempt from limiting eligibility. But through several revisions and branches of the rule, the clause allowing competition during military service was lost and not carried over into the current bylaws. NCAA rule: Despite his age, military service and complete lack of college football experience, Rhodes must take a mandatory redshirt and not play for MTSU this season . Frustrating decision: Steven Rhodes has been told he will have to sit out this season and forfeit two years of eligibility because his recreational league season spanned two academic years . Daryl Simpson, MTSU's assistant athletic director/compliance, said he doesn't believe the NCAA ever intended to penalize military service members. 'All this is strictly because of how the bylaw is worded,' he said. 'In my opinion, there is no intent of anyone to not allow protection to our U.S. service members.'

"An NYPD police psychologist has been accused by her husband of shooting him in the head while he was sleeping so that she could run-off with her married lover. Kenneth Dearden Jr, 47, filed for a temporary restraining order last week in White Plains, New York where he reportedly claimed his 46-year-old wife Emily tried to kill him and make it look like a home invasion. On November 14 last year, real estate developer Mr Dearden was found with gunshot wounds at his large home in the well-to-do Yonkers area. Kenneth Dearden, 47, filed a lawsuit last week where he reportedly claimed his 46-year-old wife Emily tried to kill him last year by shooting him in the head at their New York home to run off with her lover . The couple, pictured with their daughters, on a family vacation. Mr Dearden has now claimed in a restraining order lawsuit that his wife tried to kill him in a staged home invasion . His wife shot him 'execution-style' with a 22-caliber weapon so she could be with her lover whom she had been having an affair with for two years, according to court papers, The New York Post reported. Her lover was named as Warren Roudebush, of Texas, who allegedly ended his own marriage, according to court documents seen by The Post. Calls to Mr Roudebush's home went unanswered on Friday. According to the Supreme Court lawsuit: 'With [Kenneth] no longer in the picture, [Emily] could avoid a contentious divorce, keep the marital home and never admit the marriage infidelity to any family and friends.' According to legal documents seen by lohud.com, Mr Dearden said he fell asleep on November 14 and awoke with 'searing pain in his jaw' and blood around him. His wife was not in bed and he claimed that he thought he saw her in the doorway. Mr Dearden survived the shooting but had to have several surgeries to remove the bullet which entered near the base of his skull and lodged in his left cheek. No one has been charged in the shooting at the home, worth more than $500,000 according to records, where the couple live with their young daughters. Calls to the Dearden family home were not answered on Friday.

"A jobless man died after a vibrator became lodged in his body and was too embarrassed to see a doctor, an inquest has heard. Nigel Willis, 50, could not remove the sex toy and spent five days lying on the sofa, unable to get up because of the agonising pain, at a house he shared with his elderly mother in Forest Hill, south-east London. A friend begged him to get help, and he eventually went to University Hospital Lewisham suffering from septic shock. Scroll down for video . Treatment: Nigel Willis, 50, was taken to University Hospital Lewisham in south east London after the sex toy became stuck inside him. The pain meant he couldn't move from his sofa for five days . Southwark Coroner's Court heard he was admitted to intensive care on New Year’s Eve 2013 as a result. Surgeons managed to remove the vibrator, but he died two months later after failing to recover from his injuries. A consultant at the hospital, Dr Adebowale Adesina, told the hearing: ‘The history was that his friend or carer called an ambulance because he complained of dizziness, weakness and was unable to move from the sofa for five days.’ It was discovered Mr Willis had a ‘foreign body’ in his anus and he underwent emergency surgery. Doctor Bernd Rose, a consultant with the intensive care unit, said: ‘Mr Willis was a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of diabetes. Together with his neighbour he looked after his very elderly mother who he lived with.’ Hearing: Southwark Coroner's Court was told that the 'foreign object' caused Mr Willis to suffer septic shock . In a statement read at the inquest he said Mr Willis had been unable to remove the vibrator which he had inserted into his rectum days before his admission to hospital. ‘He was admitted to the ITU on December 31, he had a very prolonged ITU stay,’ he added. Mr Willis’s condition deteriorated and he became less responsive, dying at 7am on February 7 this year. Assistant Coroner to inner-south London Sarah Ormand-Walshe said: ‘This is a sad case of a man who died at 50 years of age. ‘He appears to have had a foreign object which has become stuck in the lower part of his bowel and had been there for a number of days when he was encouraged to go to hospital by his friends on 30 December 2013.' Ms Ormand-Walshe said Mr Willis was left ‘fighting for his life’ over the ensuing days. ‘The main cause of death clearly is just the abdomen injury,’ she said. The coroner ruled Mr Willis died as a result of an accident.","Nigel Willis could not remove the vibrator at his home in Forest Hill, London .

"American Airlines today filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a desperate push to unload huge debt from years of rising fuel prices and labour costs. The third-biggest airline in the U.S. wants to reduce costs . and its $30billion debt to stay competitive but insists the restructure will not affect flights. The move to bankruptcy protection is a crushing blow to an iconic brand and represents an alarming symbol of America’s dying economy. In trouble: American Airlines and American Eagle's parent companies are filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Parent firm AMR - based in Fort Worth, . Texas - along with regional affiliate AMR Eagle Holding, are filing . voluntary bankruptcy petitions to reorganise. The third largest U.S. airline also . said its CEO Gerard Arpey will step down and be replaced by Thomas . Horton - currently the company's president. American was the only major U.S. airline that didn't file for bankruptcy protection after the 9/11 . attacks on New York and Washington D.C. The last major airline to file for bankruptcy protection was Delta in 2005. Reshuffle: The third largest U.S. airline also said its CEO Gerard Arpey, left, will step down and be replaced by Thomas Horton, right - its current president . Labour costs are a big headache for American. It remains the only major airline that still must fund worker pensions. Jet fuel cost an average of $3 per gallon so far this year - a record according to government data that goes back to 1990. Jet fuel is more expensive now than the average of $2.96 per gallon in 2008, when oil rose above $147 per barrel for the first time. It has risen 56.4 per cent in the past five years. The average price of jet fuel was $1.92 per gallon in 2006. American says labour-contract rules . force it to spend at least $600million more than other airlines. It has . also struggled with rising jet fuel costs. American lost $162million in the third quarter and has lost money in 14 of the last 16 quarters. The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York. ‘We plan to initiate further . negotiations with all of our unions to reduce our labour costs to . competitive levels,’ CEO Thomas Horton said. Big business: The company listed assets of about $24.7 billion, liabilities of $29.55 billion and $4.1billion in cash at a court in New York . AMR's top rivals, UAL Corp and Delta . Air Lines, which both used bankruptcy protection to slash costs, have . since found merger partners. ‘We plan to initiate further . negotiations with all of our unions to reduce our labour costs to . competitive levels' Thomas Horton . Delta bought Northwest Airlines and UAL Corp bought Continental Airlines to form United Continental Holdings. AMR has been in labour talks with its pilots for five years and a wave of retirements in October had prompted speculation it was nearing a bankruptcy filing. Some analysts believed pilots chose to retire to lock in pension values that may now be in jeopardy as the company moves through bankruptcy court. Long tradition: American Airlines was formed from a group of companies over a ten-year period and started trading on the stock exchange in 1939 . 'They will have to go through the whole process that their peers have gone through,' aviation analyst John Strickland told Bloomberg. Firms use Chapter 11 bankruptcy for gaining time to restructure so they can still stay in operation. This method allows firms to keep many of their assets as they try to become profitable again rather than going straight into liquidation. 'It’s painful but probably necessary. They have fallen behind what others have done.' AMR shares have fallen almost 80 per cent this year. For the 240,000 passengers who fly American Airlines each day, the airline's bankruptcy filing should have little noticeable impact. Delta, United, Continental and US Airways all went through Chapter 11. Their planes still took off and landed and frequent flier miles were still earned and redeemed. The only risk is if the restructuring fails, the airline liquidates and ceases to fly. But travelers who bought tickets by credit card would be protected. 'Miles are safe,' said Gary Leff, co-founder of frequent flier site MilePoint. Days gone by: Air hostesses are pictured in the 1960s wearing American Airline uniforms from 1933 . American was founded in 1930 from the . combination of more than 80 smaller carriers and started trading on the . stock exchange in 1939. Half of its fleet flew for the military airline during World War Two - and it introduced the first domestic scheduled American freight service in 1944. In 1953 it was the first airline to provide a nonstop trans-continental service. Its holding company AMR was formed after a reorganisation in 1982. American is now the nation's third-largest airline behind United Continental Holdings and Delta Air Lines. It flies about 240,000 passengers per day, has around 78,000 employees and operates out of five major hubs in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago and Miami. But AMR has suffered losses of $162million in the third quarter and $2.7billion in the past year.","Texas-based AMR files voluntary bankruptcy petition .

"It may not have made the final cut of Hollywood's history, but a film historian says major American film studios collaborated with Nazi Germany in the lead up to the Second World War. From investing in German rearmament to editing out references to crimes being committed against Jews, studios including MGM, Paramount and 20th Century Fox failed to stand up to Hitler, Ben Urwand claims. 'I want to bring out a hidden episode in Hollywood history and an episode that has not been reported accurately,' the Harvard scholar said. Cancelled: A movie adaptation of the political novel and theater show It Can't Happen Here was dropped . Although other film historians dispute his claims, Urwand believes that Hollywood studio chiefs were happy to work with Nazi censors to change or cancel productions so that they could keep access to the German film market. From 1932, Nazi laws meant studios could have their licenses revoked if they produced films, shown in Germany or abroad, that were considered offensive to Germans. In his book, The Collaboration: Hollywood's Pact with Hitler, Urwand said that Hollywood was happy to bow to Hitler's demands. 'Collaboration: it's not my . word or invention. I got it from materials from both sides. It's the . word that's regularly used to describe their relationship,' the 35-year-old told the Guardian. He added that the German head of MGM spoke of the 'satisfying . collaboration on both sides' to the press. Movie critic: Historian Ben Urwand has researched the reach of Nazi influence on Hollywood before the war . Protest: Goebbels ordered Germans to disrupt screenings of the film All Quiet on the Western Front, above . MGM also invested in German rearmament to get around currency export restrictions, the historian said. Urwand believes that filmmakers not only wanted to continue working during the build up to the war, they also thought Hitler may win the war and wanted to safeguard the future of their businesses. MGM, Paramount and . 20th-Century Fox did not leave Germany until mid-1940. But even . after Hollywood started making anti-Nazi films, it . continued to erase reference to the Jews because studio chiefs, including Jewish refugees, wanted to 'avoid special pleading on their . behalf'. Urwand said studio bosses could not claim ignorance of the atrocities being carried out against the Jews because they had been forced to fire Jewish employees. 'Hollywood is collaborating and the . Nazis are having the final say on several important movies that would . have exposed what was going on in Germany,' he said. He added: 'I wouldn't want what I write to be generalisable about Jews, but specific Jews in the movie business made decisions to work with Nazi leaders.' Urwand, whose Jewish grandparents went into hiding in the war, added: 'It was [Jack] Warner who personally ordered that the word “Jew” be removed from all dialogue in the 1937 film The Life of Emile Zola""."" Censor: Propaganda minister Goebbels talks to the Hitler Youth in  Berlin in 1935 . He told the New York Times Warner's studio was the first to invite Nazi officials to Los Angeles to suggest cuts. Warner was also said to have taken a cruise on Hitler's old yacht in 1945, where he discussed post-war business opportunities, Urwand claims. The historian found a letter from January 1938 in which a 20th Century Fox worker was asking Hitler about his views on films. The letter was signed 'Heil Hitler'. Studios were also visited by a Nazi consultant, who would demand edits to films seen as being anti-German. There are also instances of whole films being dropped, like the 1936 MGM movie It Can't Happen Here, which showed democracy winning over fascism. War years: MGM is one of the studios Urwand says collaborated with Nazi Germany . The film, based on Nobel laureate Sinclair Lewis's novel, was banned over 'fear of international politics' and the potential of boycotts abroad. Nazi meddling in Hollywood has been well documented, even at the time. A headline in Newsweek in 1937 read: Long Arm of Hitler Extends to Hollywood Studio. Urwand however, has looked at how much Hollywood bent to accommodate Hitler's wishes. He claims that Nazi interference in the film industry began with the release of All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930, when Joseph Goebbels told protesters to set off stink bombs and release mice in the movie theaters. Carl Laemmle, the Jewish German-American head of Universal, then agreed to cuts. Hitler was said to have enjoyed films such as Mutiny on the Bounty and The Lives of a Bengal Lancer. He also liked Mr Smith Goes to Washington, because it showed democracy in a poor light. And while he is said to have liked Laurel and Hardy, Hitler was not keen on Charlie Chaplin's portray of him in The Great Dictator, according to the Guardian. Screen test: Hitler was not amused at Charlie Chaplin's performance in The Great Dictator . However, rival historian Tom Doherty claims that U.S. commerce department files show that rather than working with the Nazis, MGM had been advised to invest in armaments to get around currency being blocked. 'I don't see sinister, greedy . monsters. I see people trying to cope with this bizarre anomaly and . negotiate in a way that made sense to them,' the author of Hollywood and HItler: 1933-1939, said. Others have highlighted how the same studio heads who complied with Nazi censorship also paid for a spy ring. 'The moguls who have been castigated for . putting business ahead of Jewish identity and loyalty were in fact . working behind the scenes to help Jews,' Steven Ross, of the University of Southern California, said.","Ben Urwand says film industry failed to stand up to censorship .

"Actress Anna Kendrick proved her talents as a model when she starred in a stunning set of images for Kate Spade's Christmas campaign. But the Pitch Perfect star showcases more than just her beautiful looks in a newly-released video advert for the brand, in which she brings to life a feeling of festive fun, while modeling a variety of Kate Spade's glamorous holiday designs. The video, which was posted on the brand's YouTube account, sees the 29-year-old returning home to a New York apartment alongside her canine companion Milos, laden with Kate Spade shopping bags, only to discover that she has forgotten her keys and locked herself out. Stuck on the stoop: Anna returns home to find that she has locked herself out of her New York apartment . Putting on a show: The 29-year-old entertains an elderly couple as she poses for a series of selfies . After discovering that there is nobody inside who can help her, Anna makes a desperate call to a locksmith, in the hopes of quickly remedying her frustrating situation. Offering an incredibly lengthy explanation for why she ended up without her keys, she tells the locksmith: 'I think I know exactly where my keys are in my house and I'm usually not so bad about this stuff but I had this key chain and you open it and there's lip gloss inside of it and my niece gave it to me to I felt like I had to wear it for a while. 'But then I switched back to my... Yeah.' As she continues to sit and wait, Anna becomes increasingly bored and thinks up with all manner of interesting activities in order to keep herself entertained. First, she rings a friend to discuss a recent text message she received from a boy, explaining: 'He sends me a fish emoji? Is that a metaphor for something I don't get?' Before long, she begins rifling through her stack of shopping bags in the hopes of finding something which might occupy her attention.

Having well and truly thrown herself into the festive spirit, Anna pops a bottle of bubbly, which she sips through a stripey staw, and begins singing the much-loved Christmas carol Good King Wenceslas. After what seems like hours spent sitting on her stoop, Anna spots a fire escape ladder just a few feet above her head. Putting her new purchases to good use, she ties together a collection of sweaters, scarves and shoes in order to fashion a stylish - but practical rope - which she can use to pull the ladder down to the ground.

"A California school district has fired an attorney who successfully defended it during a case claiming a 14-year-old girl was mature enough to consent to a romance with her 28-year-old teacher. In civil court proceedings, the Los Angeles Unified School District argued that the unnamed student should bear some responsibility for her relationship with Elkis Hermida. The district's general counsel said Friday it is removing attorney W. Keith Wyatt from future legal matters because of inappropriate remarks he made about the case. Lawyers and advocates for sexual abuse victims criticized Wyatt's strategy of blaming the schgoolgirl for agreeing to the sexual relationship. In July 2011, Hermida, who taught at Thomas Edison Middle School, was sentenced to three years in state prison after being convicted of lewd acts against a child. He has since been freed. However the school was cleared of any wrongdoing. Speaking of the victim's 'responsibility' for the relationship, Keith Wyatt, LAUSD's attorney, told the public radio station KPCC: 'She lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher. Scroll down for video . Imprisoned: The Los Angeles Unified School District claims that a 14-year-old girl who had a six-month sexual relationship with teacher Elkis Hermida (pictured), 28, was mature enough to consent to the romance. Attorney W. Keith Wyatt (right) was fired because of remarks he made during the case . 'She went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher. Why shouldn't she be responsible for that?' Recently, the girl filed a civil lawsuit against the school district, claiming the system was negligent and she had been emotionally traumatized by Hermida's actions. In its defense, LAUSD argued it had been unaware of the relationship between the student and her teacher, but cited a federal court decision saying a minor could consent to sex in some situations. During the trial, Mr Wyatt also introduced the girl's sexual history and argued that she bore some of the responsibility for the half-year-long relationship, according to CBS Local. At the end of the case, the judge ruled in favor of the district: LAUSD was cleared of wrongdoing by a civil jury, while the girl was not awarded any damages for the trauma she allegedly suffered. Although the girl's lawyer is now appealing the case, the verdict has raised concerns about a conflict between California criminal and civil law when it comes to sexual consent. Middle school: In July 2011, Hermida, who taught at Thomas Edison Middle School (pictured) was sentenced to three years in state prison after being convicted of lewd acts against a child. He has since been freed . 'It doesn't make sense,' said Jennifer Drobac, an Indiana University law professor who has studied consent laws nationwide, including California's  age of consent (18) in criminal cases. 'The same parties, same behavior, same everything, consent is no defense in a criminal trial. But the same set of facts in a civil prosecution, consent is a complete defense. How is that possible? It's not logical.' Meanwhile, lawyers and advocates for sexual abuse victims have described LAUSD's legal tactics as appalling. 'The belief that middle school children can consent to sexual activity is something one would expect to hear from pedophile advocates, not the second-largest school district in the U.S.,' attorney John Manly told the Los Angeles Times. The girl's attorney, Fran Perez, also said he was shocked by the judge's verdict. 'I have never seen a verdict form where the child has been listed as partially responsible for his or her own molestation,' said Mr Perez. In defending his tactics, Mr Wyatt further came under fire for saying that it takes maturity to decide to cross the street and that is more dangerous than deciding to have sex with a teacher. Since speaking to KPCC, Mr Wyatt has apologized for his 'insensitive' comments. 'My statements were ill thought out and poorly articulated and by no means reflect the opinions of the school district or its leadership,' the attorney said in a written apology on Thursday. The district said it would continue using Mr Wyatt's firm.","Girl, 14, had six-month relationship with math teacher Elkis Hermida, 28 .

"European governments are accused of becoming one of Al Qaeda's biggest donors because of the huge ransoms they pay for hostages. The terror group and its affiliates netted an alleged £73million in just six years from the payments - which are cloaked in secrecy and denied by the governments accused of making them. Leading the way was France which paid a record £24million for four hostages who were freed in October last year, according to a major investigation by The New York Times. Toll: France has been accused of paying £24million for the release of  Marc Feret, Pierre Legrand, Daniel Larribe and Thierry Dol, pictured with President Hollande in October when they were freed after three years in Niger . Terror: Pierre Legrand, one of the four French hostages, during their three-year ordeal. A New York Times investigation reveals how governments mainly in Europe have bankrolled Al Qaeda to the tune of £73million . Flow of terror funds: Switzerland, France, Austria and Spain are accused of paying ransoms to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in northern Africa, including Algeria. Qatar and Oman are accused of paying ransoms to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (right) while the source of another £13m of ransom money is unaccounted for . The leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has even described kidnappings as 'an easy spoil' giving swift income to his terror network. 'Thanks to Allah, most of the battle costs, if not all, were paid from through the spoils,' the newspaper quoted him as saying. 'Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil, which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.' The most prominent case - involving by far the most money - was that of four French nuclear firm employees who stunned the world when they were returned unharmed after three years in captivity. Pierre Legrand, Thierry Dol, Daniel Larribe and Marc Feret were captured in September 2010 while working on a uranium mine in northern Niger. Their touchdown at a military airport near Paris in October, where they were met by President Francois Hollande, prompted world headlines amid claims a heavy price had been paid. Difficult choices: The U.S. insists it does not negotiate with terrorists, but there can be heavy consequences. This video released in 2004 shows American hostage Eugene Armstrong before he was beheaded by militants . Victim: Jack Hensley, a U.S. contractor working in Iraq, was also beheaded by kidnappers in 2004 who said they were part of the Al Qaeda-allied group Tawhid al-Jihad. Scores of westerners have been abducted . The French government insisted it used diplomacy to free the four men, with Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian saying: ‘France has held the same position for the past three years - we don’t pay.' But the French newspaper Le Monde, renowned for its secret service contacts, reported the country's intelligence agencies paid 20million Euros (£17m) for their release. Today's investigation puts this figure far higher - at 30million Euros (£24m) which it is claimed was paid by a state-owned company. FRANCE   £34m . QATAR AND OMAN   £12m . SWITZERLAND   £7.3m . SPAIN   £6.5m . AUSTRIA   £1.9m . SOURCE NOT KNOWN   £13m . The New York Times also claims France paid Al Qaeda 12.5million Euros (£10m) in 2011 to free three hostages from France, Togo and Madagascar. The total - £34million - means France's payments were almost triple those of the next-highest payer, Qatar and Oman (£12m). Switzerland also paid £7.3m, Spain paid £6.5m and Austria paid £1.9m, while the source of another £13m in ransom money could not be determined. Reporter Rukmini Callimachi collated the figures by interviewing former hostages, negotiators, diplomats and government sources in 10 countries. The reporter also uncovered thousands of pages of internal Al Qaeda documents which lay out the terror network's approach to kidnapping westerners. They chime with repeated warnings by the U.S. government that ransoms are now terrorism's second-biggest source of income. David Cohen, U.S. Treasury under-secretary for terrorism, claimed Al Qaeda was not the only group profiting - others include Boko Haram in Nigeria and al-Shabaab in Somalia, Nigeria and Kenya. Warnings: David Cohen, pictured left on Capitol Hill with under-secretary for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, warned ransoms were now the second-biggest income stream for terrorists including Boko Haram . Joy at a price: Daniel Larribe, one of the four French hostages, celebrates with his family last October . In a speech last month he said there had been a decline in wealthy donors bankrolling terror groups so they were relying on kidnappings instead. 'Aside from state sponsorship of terrorism, ransom payments are the greatest source of terrorist funding today,' he warned. 'Groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, and al-Shabaab have collected tens of millions of dollars in ransoms in the past several years. 'These ransom payments are used to fuel the whole cycle of terrorist activities, including inflicting indiscriminate harm. 'Improving the international effort against kidnapping-for-ransom is an urgent challenge.' The U.S. insists neither the White House nor Britain have paid terrorists. But despite the claim, the amount Al Qaeda can charge for ransoms has allegedly soared to £6million a head. It even 'outsources' its operations to criminal gangs who take a cut from the ransom when it is paid. In one case, Al Qaeda offered to free a British hostage who was captured in Mali in 2011 - if Britain agreed to release the radical preacher Abu Qatada into an 'Arab Spring' country.","New York Times investigation claims European nations are main culprits .

On Thursday the Met tweeted its own pic of an ample-bottomed sculpture that bears a striking resemblance to the one that's got so much attention over the past 48 hours. 'Here at the Met, we have artworks that can #BreakTheInternet too!' read the tweet, which even adopted the hashtag that has been blowing up on social media since Paper magazine revealed the cover of its winter issue. Scroll down for video . The photo attached to the tweet shows an ancient fertility symbol that predates Kim by about 6,500 years, although the Steatopygous female figure is slightly shorter at 8.4 inches tall. The photo attached to the tweet shows an ancient fertility symbol that predates Kim by about 6,500 years, although the Steatopygous female figure is slightly shorter at 8.4 inches tall. The Met's cheeky attempt at generating some publicity has been retweeted more than 2,000 times since it was posted on Thursday morning. 'Bless whoever wrote this Tweet. It deserves an actual visit to the Met to see this,' tweeted @MaazaMengiste. While @AngryHusky joked, 'That's obviously the only way they had in ancient times (b4 cellphones) to capture the beauty of Walmart shoppers'. Mythical beast: One internet user turned Kim Kardashian into a beautiful centaur in a hilarious meme - after seeing her naked shoot for Paper magazine . The original: Kim Kardashian certainly lit up the internet after her lewd shoot came out . Now that's an eyebrow raiser! The stunner also posted a super racy naked snap of her body from the front . Within hours of posting the image of her oiled-up, Photoshop-enhanced behind on Tuesday, the internet had gone to town with people inspired to create their own versions of the pic including everything from centaurs to docking stations. Kim may have wanted to 'break the internet' but it seems she united the online world in finding the most comical way of parodying the lewd cover - she also posed for a full frontal snap inside. Twitter user @KelKulus was reminded of a mythical creature when he saw the Paper magazine image, tweeting his own version with the caption: 'Kim Kardashian looks so much like a centaur in Paper Magazine, I figured I'd take it one step further.' Kim's rear becomes the rump of a horse, turning the reality star into a centaur, who certainly wouldn't have been booted out of the Forbidden Forest. The wife of Kanye West was then given the capital treatment by @AngryBritain, who joked that the Barclays Cycle Hire Docking Stations have been given a bootylicious makeover. Having a laugh: Entourage star Adrien Grenier spoofed the picture by superimposing his head onto her body . Dock of the week! Barclays Cycle Hire have a new style of docking stations endorsed by the Mayor of London . Two birds, one stone: Another user mocked Kim and Russell Brand at the same time . Strong look: Who needs couture when you can step out in this nude ensemble? Eyes on the prize: Kim Kardashian's bottom becomes its on person with a pair of googly peepers . She fits in in Springfield! Kim's cover got a Simpsons makeover . '@MayorOfLondon unveils new style Boris Bike rack coming to the streets of the capital soon,' the parody tweeter posted with an image of Boris Johnson parking his bike between Kim's cheeks. @GeneralBoles killed two celebrity birds with one stone by photoshopping Russell Brand's face onto Kim's derriere with a speech bubble exclaiming 'PARKLIFE!' Food items has also been another way to describe Kim's glistening rear; from peaches and potatoes to glazed donuts the internet went to the market on comparisons. Yum yum: The reality star was morphed into a tasty hot dog by one internet user . Glistening: A lot of users compared the reality star to a glazed donut . Market share: The internet also found her derriere to look like a number of food items, from potatoes to peaches . Photoshop: She also bared a resemblance to a Barbie doll, famous the play toy famous for it's unrealistic body shape . Brits do it better: Kim is compared to Pippa Middleton . 'Krispy Kim' proved to be an apt nickname for the reality star, and her rear was even replaced with two pieces of Aero chocolate. Pippa Middleton wearing that bridesmaid dress at her sister's Royal Wedding was also used as a comparision, though really the Brits behind didn't really 'do it better' than Kim. Another tweeter highlighted the mother-of-one's gravitational pull by surrounding her derriere with asteroids. Now that's a brand: The star's pert posterior symbolises the double O in Google in one sexy meme . Kim and the giant peach: the soft fruit was another thing that looked like her behind . Ooh! Someone thought her bottom wasn't quite rotund enough and added a few extra inches . Sweet treat: Krispy Kim makes an appearance, while another user compares her bum to an Aero . Banging! Another food item that looks like Kim are two uncooked sausages, apparently . The user also gave Kim a surrealist makeover by Photoshopping her bottom onto her face for quadruple the cheeky impact. One user even compared the image of Kim to that of a Barbie doll, as @SarahKhalegh pointed out: 'Kim Kardashian literally looks like a plastic &unrealistic Barbie doll. Look at her waist in comparison to her body.' It does seem the magazine have done their best to Photoshop the reality star's waist to oblivion and make a behind look bigger than James's Giant Peach. Bin thinking: The star stands in a rubbish bag in another spoofy moment . Astronomic proportions: The reality star's rear has serious gravitational pull in one meme, but in another she is given a surrealist makeover . Boredom wins: One tweeter Photoshopped the Rosetta probe landing on her bum . Mount REARmore: Kim certainly spices up the rock carvings of past presidents Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln . Flood gates are closed: There's a new Thames barrier in town and it's made of Kim Kardashian . You want some do ya? Phil Mitchell is the latest victim of Kimgate . Just under a fortnight ago, Kim stepped out looking far curvier as she joined her husband Kanye at the 2014 LACMA Art + Film Gala honouring Quentin Tarantino and Barbara Kruger. Of course the rapper, who only follows Kim on Twitter, tweeted his approval of the cover with the simple hashtag '#ALLDAY'. However Kim didn't get exactly what she wanted... the internet seems to be working perfectly fine. Curvier: At the start of the month, Kim's waist looked more natural than on the Paper magazine cover . Support: Of course Kanye had nothing but good things to hashtag about his wife .","Kim's infamous butt-baring magazine cover had been parodied to death here comes the New York Metropolitan Museum .

"Beloved: Caroll Spinney, 80, is celebrating his 45th year with the beloved children's show Sesame Street in which he has played Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch since the show's first episode in 1969 . Longtime television favorite Sesame Street celebrated it's 45th year on air this week and, with that, the man behind the show's leading puppet, Big Bird, is celebrating his 45th year as the big, yellow bird. Caroll Spinney, 80, has been both Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch for the past 45 years since the show's first episode on Nov. 10, 1969, according to CBC News. 'It doesn't feel like it was 45 years. It's amazing,' Spinney told CBC. The over eight-foot-tall bird has performed alongside countless celebrities over the years and Spinney has traveled to Japan, Australia, China, Canada, France, Germany,  and the United Kingdom for Sesame Street television specials. It has remained somewhat of a secret that the six-year-old bird is actually played by an 80-year-old man, but the public got a deeper look into the life of the man behind the feathers in the 2014 documentary 'I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story.' In the documentary, Spinney shares unknown stories of his time as both Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch like the fire that occurred in Oscar's trash can almost killing Spinney as well as Spinney cheating death when he declined an offer to take himself and his Big Bird costume aboard the ill-fated Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986. Spinney told the Los Angeles Times that when directors set out to make the documentary five years ago, they believed they would be capturing Spinney's last season as the beloved bird.

I Am Big Bird: The public got a deeper look this year into the life of the man behind the feathers in the  documentary ' I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story .' Dave LaMattina, one of the documentary's  directors, said it quickly became evident that wouldn't be the case. 'Nah,' Spinney told the Times. 'If you rest, you rust.' Along with his longstanding status as the man behind one of television's most beloved characters, Spinney has also appeared in 'Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian' starring Ben Stiller. Spinney is also an author, in 2003 he co-authored the book 'The Wisdom of Big Bird (and the Dark Genius of Oscar the Grouch) Lessons Learned from a Life in Feathers.' Celebrities: The over eight-foot-tall bird has performed alongside countless celebrities over the years . Physically Challenging: With Spinney soon to celebrate his 81st birthday, he said that playing the eight-foot-tall bird has become difficult for him physically . With Spinney soon to celebrate his 81st birthday, he told CBC that playing the eight-foot-tall bird has become difficult for him physically. Getting into the costume forces Spinney to contort himself and to sweat profusely. He told CBC that he sometimes has to breathe from an oxygen tank backstage. Because the costume is over eight-feet-tall, Spinney has to use his left arm, holding it in the air constantly, the Times reports. And he can not see through the costume but instead interacts with the other characters by watching a monitor that is strapped to his chest. Longest-Running: Spinney said that in 1969 he had no idea the show would become the longest-running children's show in television history . That does not seem to be stopping Spinney who said he hopes to put in another five years on the show. Though playing the bird may be tough, Spinney said it is fulfilling playing the bird, who he views as an extension of himself. 'I didn't have a great time at school. I was teased because of my name, my size, my big ears — and shame on them,' Spinney told the Times. 'I was a good kid who just wanted everybody to like me. That's the way Big Bird is. I'm reliving a better childhood through that bird who is a child, and I think I'm awfully lucky to have that child.' Spinney told CBC that he believes a lot of today's children's shows are inappropriate and he is proud to be a part of a show that does not wrongly influence the young generation. 'It's a wonderful feeling,' he said. 'I really love that I'm able to be these characters.' Spinney said he had no idea the show would become as big as it is back in 1969 when it 'seemed very slow and dull.' But Sesame Street is the longest-running children's show in television history.","Caroll Spinney, 80, has been both Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch for the past 45 years since the show's first episode on Nov. 10, 1969 .

"Most young couples could only dream of buying a luxury four-bedroom apartment in the centre of Manhattan. But Chelsea Clinton, 33, and husband Marc Mezvinsky, 35, are about to swap their $4 million pad for a huge new $10.5 million one nearby. The former first daughter and Mr Mezvinksy - who married in 2010 - are believed to have spotted the 5,000 sq ft property while out walking in the area. Couple: Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, seen here last November, have bought a luxury $10.5 million penthouse in Manhattan . The apartment is located in The Whitman building next to Madison Square Park, one of the most desirable corners of Manhattan's Flatiron District. They signed a contract for the property, which has stunning views of the park, last month, the New York Post reports. Her father, former US President Bill Clinton and mother - ex-Secretary of State Hillary . Rodham Clinton - are understood to have run their eyes over the couple's home during a visit last week. Her famous parents even agreed to pose for photographs with tradesmen who were carrying out work there, the Post reports. The building, which is being marketed by Douglas Elliman Real Estate, has one apartment on each floor and boasts various security features, including a key operated lift. Paying the mortgage: Chelsea and her husband Marc bought this four bedroom apartment overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan for $10.5million last spring . Beauty: The apartment features high ceilings and elegantly decorated rooms. Built in the new-Georgian style in 1924, the property has been completely renovated . Comfort: The building has been fitted with a top-of-the-range kitchen complete with the latest high quality appliances . Space: There is plenty of room for the couple's toothbrushes in the apartment's huge bathroom, which is fitted out in Italian marble . Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky's floor has four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a home office and den. It also has a 252 sq ft planting terrace and a private storage unit is included with the property. The five-story building also boasts 'top-of-the-line' amenities, including a full time doorman, residents' only gym and a refrigerated package room. Assuming Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky put down a $2.1 million deposit on the their new The Whitman $10.5 million home, their monthly mortgage bill will be $52,358 and $57,371 if the couple handed over a 10 per cent downpayment instead. This is a big jump from the still hefty $18,460-a-month repayments the pair were estimated to have been paying for their $4 million Grand Madison 'starter pad.' The couple's apartment has a massive . living area with timber floors and is flooded with natural light thanks . to floor to ceiling windows. The kitchen would be any amateur cook's dream, with a glass splash-back, a large marble worktop and state-of-the-art appliances. The spacious bedrooms in decadent New York home are equally doused in natural light with large windows overlooking the street. And the bathrooms, covered in grey marble tiles, are roomy and ultra modern. Ms Clinton married Mr Mezvinsky in Rhinebeck, . New York at a ceremony attended by many of America's most powerful . figures. She was first reported to be in a relationship with Mr Mezvinsky in 2005, and became engaged to him over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009. The couple's current flat on Fifth Avenue is far from shabby either - boasting three bedrooms, two bathrooms as well as a gym and doorman. The 1,922 sq ft condo is in the Grand Madison - a building that has been dubbed 'the most elegant and historical building downtown.' The couple will presumably sell the $4 million home, which boasts 'unforgettable views' over downtown Manhattan including Madison Square Park, the Flatiron Building and the Clock Tower - an extraordinary domed white marble building on 25th Street at Madison. Position: The apartment block is in East 26th Street, one of New York's most exclusive addresses, and boasts views over Madison Square Park . Connections: The couple pose with Ms Clinton's parents, Bill Clinton and Hilary Rodham Clinton at their wedding in 2010 . According to a Douglas Ellisman listing, the couple's 'starter pad' has a powder room, an open chef's kitchen with beautiful bluestone countertops, oak floors, Italian marble bathrooms, huge windows and scores of other luxury finishes. Assuming a 4 per cent interest rate and 20 per cent downpayment, Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky's already-hefty mortgage payments total around $18,460 a month.But they're set to skyrocket. According to StreetEasy.com, if the pair put down a $2.1 million - or 20 per cent - deposit on their new $10.5 million home, their monthly mortgage bill will be in the region of $52,000 and closer to $60,000 if the couple handed over a 10 per cent downpayment instead.","Couple spotted four-bedroom apartment while out walking in Manhattan .

"The Charlie Hebdo massacre was almost cancelled because one of the gunmen suffered a stomach bug the day before the terror attack, according to a police report. Killer Said Kouachi had a 'virulent stomach bug' that left him bed-ridden the entire day before the shooting, the leaked report revealed. But after taking anti-sickness tablets, evil Kouachi had recovered enough to leave his home on the morning of January 7 and attack the offices of the satirical magazine in central Paris. Killers: Brothers Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right) who killed 12 people during the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices. Said was sick the day before, and almost cancelled the planned assault . Evil: The brothers went on the run in France following their deadly attack on the satirical magazine, which they targeted because it had published cartoon images of the Prophet Mohammed . He left his home and told wife Soumya he would return 'this evening or tomorrow', before linking up with brother Cherif and gunning down 12 people in cold blood. The killers targeted Charlie Hebdo after the controversial paper had published cartoon images of the Prophet Mohammed. The inquiry also found that the night before the attack, Cherif Kouachi met an Islamist gunmen who was behind a synchronised but separate terrorist strike in Paris. Phone records have indicated that Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly met just 10 hours before beginning their three-day killing spree in and around Paris in early January. They are believed to have met in Gennevilliers, the town near Paris where Kouachi lived, according to the police inquiry. And around one hour before  the Charlie Hebdo offices were attacked, records show that Kouachi sent a text message  to one of the 13 phone numbers belonging to Coulibaly, according to Le Monde newspaper. Coulibaly went on to shoot dead an unarmed policewoman the next day, before taking hostages at a Jewish supermarket in  Paris on January 9. Accomplice: Amedy Coulibaly met with Cherif Kouachi just 10 hours before the fanatics began their three-day killing spree in and around Paris. In total, 17 people were murdered by the trio . That siege ended after he killed a further four people, before police stormed the building and killed Coulibaly in a blaze of bullets. During the siege, Coulibaly had told French media  that he had 'synchronized' the attacks with the Kouachi brothers, but failed to provide any further details. Detectives also allegedly discovered that Coulibaly filmed his attack on his assault on the kosher supermarket with a high-tech GoPro camera attached to his chest. It is understood the footage was then sent via internet from the hostage scene, but it has not been posted since. Solidarity: Just days after the attacks, an estimated 3.7 million people took to the streets of Paris in a defiant show of support for Charlie Hebdo staff . Four suspected accomplices of Coulibaly remain under formal investigation for allegedly supplying him with weapons, a bulletproof vest, knives, tear gas and a car. All have denied knowledge of his terrorist intentions. In total, 17 people were killed in the two terror attacks, along with the three gunmen who were killed in shootouts with police. Days later, more than 3.5 million people took to the streets of Paris in a defiant show of strength in support of Charlie Hebdo and the murdered victims.","Said Kouachi forced to spend day before murders in bed because of bug .

"Tragic: Cassie Turton, 26, took an overdose of over-the-counter medicine hours after her partner ended their relationship . A grieving mother claims her pregnant daughter accidentally killed herself in a ‘moment of madness’ after her boyfriend ended their relationship because she refused to have an abortion. Cassie Turton from King's Lynn, Norfolk, took an overdose of over-the-counter medicine hours after partner, Michael Fysh, finished their seven-month romance. The 26-year-old restaurant supervisor wanted to start a family, despite suffering from Marfan syndrome, a genetic condition that increases risks during pregnancy. After telling her partner she wanted to keep the baby, she slashed her wrists and then sent images of what she had done to his phone in a cry for help. Mr Fysh, 27, raised the alarm by forwarding the pictures to Miss Turton's mother, Sandra Hammond-Grant, who immediately rushed to her flat to find her being helped by a neighbour. She said Mr Fysh, who has two children from another relationship, evantually turned up, but started a vicious argument with her daughter and stormed off. Her condition then got worse and Mrs Hammond-Grant was forced to drive her to hospital after an ambulance failed to turn for 40 minutes after they called 999. Tragically, Miss Turton died hours later, on Valentine’s Day, in Papworth Hospital, Cambridge. A post mortem concluded the cause of death was an overdose. Mrs Hammond-Grant, 50, said her daughter was delighted to be pregnant and refuses to believe she meant to kill herself. 'She had always dreamed of finding her perfect man and then having a happy baby. It’s all gone so tragically wrong,' she said. 'She was so caring towards him, always cooking for him and buying him things but he was a jack the lad, he thought he was it, always out with his mates. 'She had talked about leaving him but didn’t want to kill the baby or raise it alone, so felt trapped.' The family said they have heard nothing from Mr Fysh since the tragedy and feel ‘too angry’ to approach him. Her brother, Bradley Prior, 31, said: 'If you narrow it all down, it was either ""You kill the baby or I’m not going to be with you"". That’s how blunt it was. No one should ever be in that position.' Couple: Michael Fysh, right, rushed to Miss Turton's apartment after telling him she wanted to keep their baby . Devastated: Miss Turton's mother Sandra Hammond-Grant (pictured left with her daughter) does not believe her daughter wanted to kill herself and claims she wanted to keep the baby . It is a hereditary disorder, which means it is passed to a child from a parent, and affects around one in 5,000 people. Sufferers tend to be unusually tall, with long limbs and long, thin fingers. The connective tissues (which separate organs and muscles) are affected, because the carrier does not have enough of the protein called fibrillin. As a disease, it can be very difficult to diagnose because the symptons can vary from one sufferer to another . The most serious complications are defects of the heart valves and aorta. It may also affect the lungs, eyes, dural sac surrounding the spinal cord and the skeleton. Pregnancy poses additional risks to women with Marfan syndrome because of the increased stress on the heart and blood vessels. Any pregnancy in a woman affected by Marfan syndrome should be considered 'high-risk' and there is a 50 per cent chance the child will be born with the disease. Miss Turton, a restaurant supervisor, had gone with for a pregnancy check-up with her mother the morning before her death. Her mother added: 'It was just a mad five minute temper, a moment of madness, she can’t have realised the consequences.' 'She was energetic, bubbly and so sociable. She has a wicked, funny sense of humour and the most wonderful smile. 'She would brighten up every room, just fill it with happiness. I can’t imagine life without her.' Miss Turton's family claim the East of England Ambulance Service Trust also has questions to answer, after paramedics took more than 40 minutes to arrive. But the trust said they arrived to find the patient had left the address and nobody was home when they arrived. A spokeswoman said: 'We received a 999 call at 9.30pm on February 13 to reports of an unwell female. 'A paramedic called the caller back at 10.02pm but was told that the patient had left the address and would be taken to hospital by her family once they located her.' An inquest into Cassie’s death has been opened at Norwich Coroner’s Court. Mr Fysh’s mother yesterday said her son did not want to comment.

"These adorable cubs may look cute and unassuming but they are in fact the rarest of their species – and could grow to be the biggest cats in the world. The four handsome male ‘liger’ cubs are the first ever to be born from a white male lion and white female tiger, making them the world’s most unique big cats. There are only around 300 white lions and 1,200 white tigers left in the world, so the cubs’ father, Ivory and mother, Saraswati, are extremely rare in their own right. Scroll down for video . Meet the family: Yeti, Odlin, Sampson and Apollo are the world's first ever white lion-tiger hybrids - or 'ligers' Four of a kind: The male cubs were born from a white male lion and white female tiger, making them unique . Rare pairing: Parents Ivory, a lion, and Saraswati, a tiger, were brought together at a park in South Carolina . But now, having been brought together at Myrtle Beach Safari in South Carolina, they have produced the first ever white lion-tiger hybrids - commonly known as ligers. There are around 1,000 ligers in the world – most in captivity – but none of them are white. Born only six weeks ago, the young animals already weigh 15lbs and gain on average a pound in weight every day. And the boys, named Yeti, Odlin, Sampson and Apollo, already have their own personalities. Unique breed: There are around 1,000 ligers in the world - most in captivity - but none of the others are white . Big cats: The handsome male 'liger' cubs already weigh 15lbs and gain on average a pound in weight every day . Apollo is the smallest, who his owners say behaves more like a house kitten, purring all the time and always demanding to be stroked. Yeti is the biggest and most boisterous, pushing past his smaller brothers and always wanting to be the centre of attention. The cubs’ uncle, Hercules, is officially the world’s largest cat at 922 lbs and 131 inches long and is featured in the Guinness Book of World Records. Founder and director of the safari, Dr . Bhagavan Antle, who bred the animals, says he is sure Yeti will reach . this size – if not larger. Individual characters: The boys, who were bred at Myrtle Beach Safari, already have their own personalities . ‘I am convinced Yeti will make the Guinness Book of Records. He’s so big already – he has such a big, fat head and paws. ‘All the cubs grow so quickly, but Yeti is already so much bigger. ‘I skip a day seeing them and it looks like they’ve doubled in size. It’s like someone’s blowing them up with a tyre pump.’ Dr Antle, who set up the safari 31 years . ago and had his first litter of ligers in 1988, said: ‘People are . getting on planes to fly in to see them. Record size: Their uncle, Hercules (pictured), is officially the world's largest cat at 922 lbs and 131 inches long . ‘We’ve had everyone from Congress to people of all walks of life come. They are honestly such an incredibly unique sight. ‘They have a beautiful creamy colour that I’ve never seen on a cat before.' The cubs are expected to reach 10ft tall by two years old and weigh around 750lbs. When they are four-years-old they could weight over 900lbs. Their father, Ivory, is a white African lion and their mother, Saraswati, is a snow white Bengal tiger.

An autopsy report lists marijuana intoxication as a 'significant contributing factor' in the death of 19-year-old Levi Thamba Pongi, a native of the Republic of Congo who witnesses say leaped from a Holiday Inn balcony on March 11. Pongi's death is now the first in the state listed with such a cause since Colorado legalized marijuana January 1. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Congolese exchange student studying at Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming has reportedly become the first person whose death was officially ruled as caused--at least in part--by marijuana consumption following Colorado's legalization of the drug . Pongi's friends told investigators he ate the cookie and 'exhibited hostile behavior' that included pulling things off walls and speaking erratically, the report said. Attempts by the three friends to calm Pongi seemed to work until he went outside and jumped over the balcony railing, according to the report. Denver police ruled the death an accident and their investigation remains open. Michelle Weiss-Samaras, a spokeswoman for the Denver County medical examiner's office, told the Denver Post that investigators have no evidence Pongi had underlying psychological issues. 'We have no history of any other issues until he eats a marijuana cookie and becomes erratic and this happens,"" she said. 'It's the one thing we have that's significant.' Colorado law bans the sale of . recreational marijuana products to people under 21. Possession by people . under 21 is also against the law. Authorities said one of Pongi's friends was old enough to buy the cookie from a pot shop. The . medical examiner's office had Pongi's body tested for at least 250 . different substances, including bath salts and synthetic marijuana, . which are known to cause strange behavior. Rare fatality: Pongi died after leaping form a fourth story Holiday Inn balcony. He and some friends had driven to Denver over spring break to try legal marijuana . His blood tested positive only for THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, according to the report. 'We were told they came here to try it,' said Weiss-Samaras . One of Pongi's friends also tried the cookie but stopped after feeling sick. The marijuana concentration in Pongi's blood was 7.2 nanograms of active THC per milliliter of blood. Colorado law says juries can assume someone is driving while impaired by marijuana if their blood contains more than 5 nanograms per milliliter of the chemical. Officials at Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming, say Pongi started taking classes as an exchange student in January. He was studying engineering. 'The Northwest College campus community continues to grieve after Levy's death,' the college said in a statement. 'All of us were deeply saddened by this tragic incident and feel for his family.' Sad: Marijuana cookies like these are legal to buy and consume in much of Colorado. However, Pongi was 19 and you must be 21 to buy pot in the state. Officials believe one of the teen's friends was old enough to make the purchase .","Congolese exchange student Levi Thamba Pongi attended Northwest College in Powell, Wyoming .

"Heavy use of mouthwashes may lead to a higher risk of oral cancer, an expert claims. Research suggests that people rinsing with such products more than three times a day have a greater chance of developing mouth and throat cancer. Dr David Conway, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow Dental School, said people should not routinely use a mouthwash and stick to brushing and flossing instead. Danger? A dental lecturer had advised against regular use of mouthwash, saying it could be linked to cancer . Poor oral health – one of the reasons people regularly use the rinses – also plays a part in cancer risk, he added. The research supports an Australian study in 2009, which said there was ‘sufficient evidence’ that mouthwashes containing alcohol contribute to an increased risk of the disease, because they allow cancer-causing substances to penetrate the lining of the mouth more easily. In the latest study, in journal Oral Oncology, University of Glasgow researchers and European colleagues assessed 1,962 cancer sufferers and 1,993 healthy people in 13 centres across nine countries. Doubts: The study also found those who used it to cover smoking and alcohol were more at risk . Those with poor oral health, including people with dentures and persistently bleeding gums, were at greater risk, they found. The study set out to identify risk . factors for oral cancers affecting the mouth and larynx, as well as . oesophageal cancer of the gullet. Dr Conway said ‘I would not advise routine use of mouthwash, full stop. 'There . are occasions and conditions for which a dentist could prescribe a . mouthwash - it could be that a patient has a low salivary flow because . of a particular condition or medicine they are taking. ‘But for me, . all that’s necessary in general is good regular brushing with a fluoride . toothpaste and flossing combined with regular check-ups by a dentist.’ He added there may be a link between excessive mouthwash rinsing and people who use it to mask the smell of smoking and alcohol – independent risk factors for oral cancer. The researchers were unable to analyse the types of mouthwash because they were used many years ago by those in the study. Professor Damien Walmsley, adviser to the British Dental Association, said the study was not ‘conclusive’. 'It does, however, reaffirm that smoking together with heavy drinking and a poor diet over time are strong risk factors for developing cancers of the oral cavity and oesophagus,' he said. 'Unfortunately, these behaviours cannot be disassociated from people who neglect their oral hygiene and rarely, if ever, visit the dentist, as this study suggests. 'It also highlights that people, who are at risk of developing these cancers, may be using alcohol-based mouthwashes inappropriately to disguise smoking or drinking alcohol. 'Mouthwashes should be used according to manufacturer's directions.'","Warning from Dr David Conway of University of Glasgow Dental School .

"My daughter Imogen can’t be more than six months old in the photo. Propped up with cushions on the sofa, her chubby little fingers grasp not a favourite cuddly toy, but a cup of tea. Moments earlier she’d carefully, slowly, brought it to her lips for a sip. Judging by the delighted look on her face, she clearly relished the brew. Now seven, Imogen still loves her cup of tea in the morning, and it’s the same story for both her little brothers. Scroll down for video . Time for tea: Isabella Scriven, aged two, enjoys a cup of tea with her mum Debra . Hugo, six, won’t go to school unless he has polished off at least two cups — and it had better be ‘builder’s’, made from tea bags. He can’t stand the posh stuff, and woe betide if there are any tea leaves floating at the top. Oscar, who has just turned four, likes his milky and sweet. I’m mortified by their tea-drinking. My own mother wouldn’t have dreamed of letting me drink tea as a child growing up in London; she considered it a social drink for adults, almost as taboo as alcohol. The reason my own children developed the habit is that we lived for the first few years of their lives on the North Yorkshire/Lancashire border with my mother-in-law — a granny who loved to have a natter with her grandchildren over a cuppa. From around the age of two, she’d give them tea in the afternoon, which they’d enjoy with a ginger biscuit or two. The tea was milky, tepid and laced with sugar. I didn’t like it, but it seemed rude to tell her she couldn’t carry on a family tradition; her own children had always enjoyed a ‘hot drink’ when they were young. Shall I be mother? Six-month-old Imogen takes a sip of tea . Also, as a ‘soft Southerner’, I felt I was being disrespectful to her culture. According to her, it’s still common for young children to drink tea in the north of England. Even after moving hundreds of miles south to Hampshire in 2012, my repeated attempts to wean my trio off tea have all ended in failure — partly because I am sabotaged when Granny comes to stay, and partly because the school run is hard enough without wailing children refusing to get in the car until they’ve had their morning brew. But the subject of whether young children should have a cup is a hotly debated on many a parenting forum. ‘I really, really don’t like seeing babies and toddlers drinking tea, and seeing it in a bottle is just awful!’ writes one mum. ‘I certainly won’t be encouraging my son to drink anything like that at home where he’s happy with fruit juice, water or milk,’ adds another. Certainly at my local toddler group in rural Hampshire, I find myself in a minority of one when I queue for a beaker of tea for Oscar at break-time. I’ve noticed a few pointed looks as I hold out his sippy cup. At first glance, the case against giving toddlers tea does look pretty powerful. Dietitian Chris Cashin, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, warns young children shouldn’t drink tea because it can interfere with the absorption of iron. ‘Tea contains compounds, called polyphenols, which bind with iron, making it harder for our bodies to absorb it,’ she explains. ‘Iron deficiency causes symptoms such as tiredness and lethargy, and can make it harder to concentrate.’ Tea for two:  Debra and Imogen enjoy the family ritual of drinking tea together . For small children, this may also mean they reach developmental milestones late. Iron is vital for brain development, and children who lack iron may also fail to grow at the expected rate. But it’s the caffeine in tea that is the biggest cause for concern. As well as being a stimulant, it can lead to calcium deficiency. Studies suggest that drinking as little as two cups of tea a day can decrease your ability to absorb calcium — not a problem if you are an adult eating a healthy, balanced diet, but potentially an issue if you are a fast-growing child. Tannin, the compound that gives tea its colour, also stains teeth. I have to admit that little Imogen did have a bit of tea staining on her teeth, but it was simply polished off at the dentist’s. But according to other experts, tea actually is a good drink for toddlers. Health boost: Experts say they are happy to recommend tea for pre-schoolers . For a start, it may be beneficial to enamel because it contains fluoride that remineralises and hardens the tough outer coating of baby and adult teeth, according to Karen Coates, dental adviser at the British Dental Health Foundation. ‘You couldn’t use tea instead of toothpaste, but it has a reasonable amount of fluoride and could have a positive impact on teeth,’ she says. Of course, any benefit would be cancelled out if a child drank tea with sugar, which I have to admit is the case with Oscar and Hugo, who insist on at least one spoonful. But at least none of my children has ever had tea from a bottle, which is particularly damaging because it keeps the sugary liquid close to the teeth for longer, increasing the risk of decay. ‘Only water and milk should be drunk from bottles, but tea from a cup would be fine, as long as it is sugar-free,’ says Karen Coates. ‘Make it milky to get the added benefit of calcium.’ A recent study in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics found that children who drank moderate amounts of tea (up to two cups a day) suffered no harmful effects. The small amounts of caffeine in two cups could even be beneficial, by increasing concentration in school or in sports performance. Studies showing negative effects of caffeine on children, including anxiety and sleep problems, relate to high doses. A ten-year-old would have to drink 160mg per day of caffeine (four to six cups). Tea is also a recognised source of flavonoids, plant compounds with proven health effects including boosting heart health. To my amazement Dr Carrie Ruxton, the author of the study, says she is happy to recommend tea for pre-schoolers. Enjoying a cuppa: Like Isabella and Debra, Thea's children Imogen, Hugo and Oscar love a cup of tea in the morning . Dr Ruxton is also a member of the Tea Advisory Panel, a body funded by the British tea industry to provide information on the health benefits of a cuppa. ‘Up to a certain point, tea is an excellent drink for children,’ she says. ‘But, like other caffeine-containing drinks, it should be consumed in moderation, with no more than two cups a day for a toddler.’ Up to a certain point, tea is an excellent drink for children but it should be consumed in moderationDr Carrie Ruxton . According to Dr Ruxton, tea — which is 99 per cent water — is an excellent way to hydrate children, and unlike bottled water contains many antioxidants, minerals and nutrients. ‘Children who drink milky tea, as opposed to fizzy drinks and fruit juices, are getting a sugar-free source of fluids,’ she says.  For a caffeine-free alternative, try Rooibos tea. Finally, there’s the social aspect. Debra Scriven, 42, an office administrator from Liphook in Hampshire, says that daughters Isabella, two, and seven-year-old Emma love to copy their mum and dad Robert, 38, in a ‘family ritual’ of drinking tea. The girls started when they were still in nappies with very milky tea. Debra says: ‘Just think of truly harmful things, like junk food.’ As for me, now that I know a cup or two a day is unlikely to cause my three children long-term harm, I’m certainly more relaxed. If only Hugo and Oscar would stop slipping in all that sugar.","Thea Jourdan's three children love a cup of tea in the morning .

"Rush-hour commuters might have been forgiven for thinking that the audacious armed ambush of a prison van was part of a scene for a television crime drama – but it was all too real. They watched in horror as a car was driven across a busy road into the side of the van, forcing it to a halt. Three men wearing balaclavas leapt out of the car and a guard on the armoured GEOAmey van was threatened with a sawn-off shotgun as the men smashed the van’s windows with axes and sledgehammers. Scroll down for video . Robbery charges: Stevie McMullen (left), 31, and . Ryan McDonald (right), 20, escaped from the vehicle after it was broken . into with a sawn-off shotgun and police admitted both men 'represent a . risk to the community' Investigation: The GEOAmey prison van was on Regent Road with its side door open and glass all over the road . Dangerous: Police warn that 20-year-old Ryan McDonald, of Salford, is still at large and should not be approached . Two prisoners jumped out and all five . men ran to the green Saab and drove off. It was quickly abandoned on a . side street, and two men sped off on a motorbike, while the others ran . into the Ordsall council estate in Salford. A witness said: ‘I saw a dark green . car with three men in it. They had balaclavas. I thought it was a bit . strange and kept looking back to see what the car was doing. Then I saw . the car pull across the road straight into the side of the Transit van . and the men smashed the windscreens. ‘I kept walking and called the police . and I could hear the smashing of screens. I looked back because I’d . heard some more shouts and there were some men running towards me, so I . just sprinted as fast I could into the estate. I was pretty scared.’ Last night, police were hunting Steve . McMullen, 31, and Ryan MacDonald, 20, who were being taken to nearby . Manchester Crown Court. They warned members of the public not to . approach them. McMullen was on trial for conspiracies . to kidnap, rob, commit arson and possess a firearm. MacDonald was due . to be sentenced after admitting conspiracy to commit robbery. The men were being transported from . HMP Altcourse, Britain’s first privately financed prison, which is run . by G4S, the firm behind the Olympic Games security fiasco. One of the men had been apparently . using a mobile phone to post messages on his Facebook page in recent . weeks. A Prison Service source said a call or a text could have been . sent to alert the ambushers. A spokesman for GEOAmey, the prisoner . transport firm, said: ‘We are liaising with Greater Manchester Police.’ Last night, a woman, 28, and a man, 24, were arrested on the Ordsall . estate on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender. They remain in police custody for questioning. Police have warned they are 'a . risk to the community' and were dubbed the 'most wanted men in Britain' as a major manhunt got underway. McDonald, from Salford, was charged in January after a . stolen Volkswagen Polo he was in was chased and cornered by police following a gangland . shooting which left a 20-year old man injured. On his Facebook page McDonald appeared to have posted . pictures of himself larking about with other inmates at Hindley Young Offender . Institution and flexing his muscles for the cameras. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a green . car drive across the carriageway of the road before smashing into the . side of the white van, before a group of men ran into the nearby Ordsall . estate. One said: ‘I crossed the road and saw a . dark green car with three men in it. They had balaclavas on.

There was a huge police presence in . the area around Salford, including police dogs, as the hunt continued . for the men who it is believed have been sprung from the van. A Prison Service source suggested the . ambush would probably involve one of the escapees having access to a . smuggled mobile phone - of high value inside jail with inmates banned . from having them. A phone call could then be made or a . text sent to let the armed gang know which prison van they were in and . so which vehicle to target, among the many vans making their way from . jail to court. The ambushed van which has CCTV was . operated by prisoner escort firm GEOAmey and was on its way to a court . from privately-run HMP Altcourse.

"A woman with tiny size two feet has finally learned to wear high heels - after taking lessons in how to walk. Angela Belassie, 36, had resigned herself to a life of flat footwear because she walked 'like John Wayne' - the legendary cowboy actor with an awkward walk - in high heels and would frequently topple over. But she then underwent a course of treatment with clinical orthologist Martin Bell, who specialises in correcting postural problems. Angela Belassie, who has size two feet, has had to have walking lessons to stop her falling over every time she wore high heels . After analysing her gait and posture on a special ‘runway’, he prescribed a series of exercises to strengthen her core muscles and correct her stride. Now Angela, who runs her own PR company, is proudly strutting around in five-inch stilettos. She said: 'Beforehand my walk was clunky and not very elegant, but after the sessions it was amazing, my husband noticed the difference straight away. 'I have always wanted to wear heels, especially when I went to weddings. Now I wear heels more frequently and even on a daily occurrence, where as before it was special occasions only.' Angela constantly struggled in oversized, padded heels but felt she had to wear them to formal occasions to 'look the part' Angela, from Stapleton, Bristol, has never been able to find suitable shoes and if she did wear heels they were too big and had to be padded out. However, the tiny length of her feet meant she struggled to balance. 'At a size two, I struggled to find a pair of shoes to fit me or the weddings I had to go to - in one shop alone I tried on 10 pairs,' she said. 'In the end, I settled for a pair of plain black sling backs, with both toe and heel stoppers. Their simple style suited each outfit I wore. 'Whereas I may have looked the part, I certainly didn’t walk it. My gait was not that dissimilar to John Wayne. And on my own wedding day I was not so much walked up the aisle, as supported along the way. 'I had resigned myself to a life in flat shoes, with heels only making a very brief outing only at weddings, before changing into comfy shoes as soon as possible.' Angela has never been able to find suitable shoes and if she did wear heels they were too big and had to be padded out. However, the tiny length of her feet meant she struggled to balance, until now . Angela Also used the extra inches to boost her petite 5ft stature, but was constantly compared to actor John Wayne when she walked . Her tiny feet meant most heels were too big, and she resorted to either filling them with extra insoles or ultimately, sending them back . Angela first met Martin at a networking event in Bristol where he suggested she come along for some help. Martin has worked with Olympians and Paralympians to help overcome recurring injuries and improve their performance. The clinical orthotist has already helped hundreds of women by teaching them to stand and use their leg muscles properly and 'fight' what their body has become used to. His unique course - ‘Perfectly Poised’ - takes place in his offices in the suburb of Clifton, Bristol. It involves filming his client walking in her heels and then playing back the footage to analyse her walk. Martin, who trained her to walk, has worked with Olympians and Paralympians to help overcome recurring injuries and improve their performance . Angela Belassie's size two foot (right) compared to a size 9 man's foot . He examines the way in which each girl uses their legs and back when walking, picking out subtle hints with their posture that could help alleviate their pain. He then gives them exercises to help strengthen any weak muscles and improve their walk. 'I’d been given exercises by a physiotherapist in the past to treat runner’s knee,' Angela said. 'Back then I preferred to cut short my running days rather than carry them out but this time I was spurred on by vanity and the desire to wear such pretty shoes. 'They not only gave me the appearance of being taller, but also slimmer. 'One of Martin’s workouts included the ""dog poo shuffle"", which involved rubbing my foot on the floor with force as if cleaning mess off it. 'My bemused husband also looked on as I walked past him on my tiptoes - backwards. But I slowly developed the ""tightrope walk"" and moved more elegantly as a result. 'Following my final session, Martin played the before and after video and I was amazed by the difference.' Angela was also put in touch with Tom Reader, who set up Pretty Small Shoes to offer fashionable footwear starting from a child’s size 13. His partner Jiyeon Yeom, 41, also just a size two, was the inspiration behind the business. Tom said: 'The percentage of women with small size feet, which are below size three, is therefore now very low and at around just two to three per cent of adults. 'Mainstream manufacturers do not find it economically viable to make shoes in those sizes and those who do still use styles which have hardly changed since the 1990s.'","Angela, 36, would fall over every time she walked in heels .

"Death rates in NHS hospitals are among the highest in the western world, shock figures revealed yesterday. British patients were found to be almost 50 per cent more likely to die from poor care than those in America. They have five times the chance of dying from pneumonia and twice the chance of being killed by blood poisoning. Experts say that, despite recent improvements, NHS death rates still outstrip those in many other European countries. British patients were found to be almost 50 per cent more likely to die from poor care than those in America. Pictured is a tribute wall  in memory of patients who have died at Stafford Hospital . Figures obtained by Professor Brian Jarman, in an exclusive report for Channel 4 News, show that the death rates in English hospitals last year were 45 per cent higher than in America. Sir Brian, a globally-recognised expert on hospital performance, also calculated that in 2004 death rates for hospitals in England were 22.5 per cent higher than in six  others in the western world including Canada and France. The latest figures are not yet available although Professor  Jarman suspects death rates in England have fallen because care has substantially improved. ‘What I found was that the adjusted death rate in England was about 22 per cent higher than for the average of all the seven countries that I looked at and it was about 58 per cent higher than the best of the countries,’ he said. An investigation was launched following concerns about high death rates and poor care at the hospital run by Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust . ‘I expected us to do well and was very surprised we didn’t do well – but there is no means of denying the results as they are absolutely clear.’ ‘We should take notice of it and say there is a problem in the provision of health care in England.’ Earlier this year a report warned that hundreds of patients had died needlessly due to poor care at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust. But this was not an isolated case and a subsequent review led by the Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of the NHS, found that thousands of patients had died unnecessarily at 14 other trusts through neglect. Ministers have since put 11 of these trusts into special measures  including North Cumbria, Northern Lincolnshire and Goole, Tameside and Basildon and Thurrock. Hit squads have been sent in to make urgent improvements. Yesterday Sir Bruce said he would be holding urgent discussions with other officials about the data.‘I want our NHS to be based on evidence. I don’t want to disregard stuff that might be inconvenient or embarrassing,’ he said. ‘I want to use this kind of data to help inform how we can improve our NHS. ‘So what we need to do as clinical professionals in our NHS is concentrate on how we can improve that and I will be the first to bring this data to the attention of clinical leaders in this country to see how we can tackle this problem. ‘The fact is we have a health service that is admired around the world, founded on the cradle to grave principle. But the other fact is we still have too many patients dying in our hospitals when their relatives were expecting them to come home.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘This Government has shone an unprecedented spotlight on poor care through the Keogh review of 14 hospitals with persistently high rates, and taken tough action to tackle these problems by placing 11 hospitals in special measures. ‘Sadly, warnings about high death rates were ignored too frequently in the past. ‘Following the horrors of Mid Staffordshire, we have established a new rigorous inspection regime led by the Chief Inspector of Hospitals. ‘He will look at mortality data as well as issues of leadership and culture, and we will act quickly where problems are uncovered.’ Figures show that the death rates in English hospitals last year were 45 per cent higher than in America. File picture . Sir Brian pioneered the use of hospital standardised mortality ratios (HSMRs) as a way of measuring whether death rates are higher or lower than expected. They are adjusted for factors such as age and the severity of the patient’s illness. It was by using HSMRs that Professor Jarman was able to identify the high mortality rates at the Mid Staffs trust. He said one of the reasons that American hospitals do much better is because staff are actively encouraged to report mistakes – and whistleblowers are not persecuted as they sometimes are in the NHS. He said: ‘If you go to the States doctors can talk about problems, nurses can raise problems and listen to patient complaints. Hospitals were urged yesterday to ensure consultants work seven days a week. The Royal College of Physicians, which issued the call, also wants specialist doctors to travel to see elderly patients on wards. A patient with several illnesses such as angina, diabetes and dementia often has to travel to clinics dotted around their hospital. The Royal College also wants a chief of medicine to be appointed in every hospital to oversee the care of the elderly.","Clinical care trails the rest of the Western World, it has emerged .

"Spooky footage claims to have captured the ghost of a long-dead Lord Mayor communicating with paranormal investigators. Experts caught the eerie interactions on camera during a guided tour of the Liverpool Medical Institute, which is renowned for its apparently unexplained sightings. The team from Sefton Paranormal Investigators claimed to have noticed several elements of what they believe to be spiritual activity as they watched the footage back after the tour last month. Scroll down for videos . Spooky: Footage taken by the team apparently shows a ghostly orb  crossing the main staircase of the Liverpool Medical Institute, which was opened in 1837 . Haunted? Others have claimed to have seen a ghostly figure of a man and his dog in the same site . The Liverpool Medical Institute, which opened in 1837, is one of the oldest medical societies in the world. There have been previous claims of ghostly sightings on the main staircase, the library and the Victorian lecture theatre . And the team, made up of four investigators and 17 members of the public, claim to have made contact with Richard Caton, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool from 1907-1908 - who died in 1926. Their investigation began by identifying areas within the 19th century Grade II-listed building as potential hotspots for activity. Pamela Robinette, from Sefton Paranormal Investigators, said: 'As a rule of thumb, we always begin by simply asking if there are any spirits that wish to communicate with us. 'When we reached the medical library we set up electro-magnetic field sensors, known as rempods, on the outer side of the room. Detection: Pamela Robinette, from Sefton Paranormal Investigators, claimed that the electro-magnetic sensors in the medical library picked up a signal, pictured, from Richard Caton,  Lord Mayor of Liverpoool . 'If we did make contact, then the sensor should detect the electro-magnetic field that all spirits possess and set off an audible alarm with flashing lights - but it is very rare for this device to react. 'The walls are covered with portraits of past significant bodies and we started by asking for the people in the portraits to step toward the device. 'After calling for Richard Caton, Lord Mayor of Liverpool in 1908, the alarms went off. 'We continued to direct questions to Richard Caton for two hours and have documented evidence of seventeen occurences in which the rempod was set off. 'And spookily, each time this happened the temperature would drop by a staggering five degrees just before.' On the case: The team at Sefton Paranormal Investigators, pictured, claim to have made contact with Richard Caton, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool from 1907-1908 - who died in 1926 . Another part of the footage claims to show a ghostly orb at the foot of the main staircase, where others are said to have seen ghostly figures of a man and his dog. The light anomaly seems to appear out of thin air before crossing the path of the group and disappearing again. A member of the team walks straight past the orb and appears not to notice it. Ms Robinette claimed that the orb was too bright and intense to be dust, and that if it had been an insect there would have been a specific flight path and shape.","Group was taking a guided tour of the Liverpool Medical Institute .

"Poor school achievement from white boys is linked to immigration from Eastern Europe according to Labour's shadow education secretary. Tristram Hunt, who is a former television historian, said that more must be done to train British youngsters for skilled jobs. He claimed that change was essential as more people from the EU continue to arrive to compete for jobs. Labour's Tristram Hunt says that his party got their immigration forecasts 'badly wrong' Mr Hunt also branded Conservative education secretary Michael Gove a 'zealot'  with a ' highly aggressive investment-banker model of school.' Mr Hunt also branded current education secretary Michael Gove a 'zealot' The comments were made in an interview with The Fabian Society which will be published next week. They come days before migrants . from Romania and Bulgaria will be granted the unrestricted right to live . and work in the UK. And Mr Hunt said that the previous Labour government got their immigration forecasts 'badly wrong'. The Telegraph reported that Mr Hunt said: 'What we can do in the education sphere is to [show] that there is a growing issue of white British boys not getting the education they want.' And when asked if he thought that poor attainment in Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and the Kent coast is because of high levels of EU migration there, Mr Hunt said: 'Exactly. And that comes back to the supply side, we have to get in there.' He added: 'In 1997 the focus was on standards and expansion of the higher education sector. 'We all thought the knowledge economy was the answer and that financial services would keep going forever.'","Tristram Hunt said that British youngsters must be trained for skilled job .

"As global leaders prepare to board Brisbane bound flights for this weekend's G20 Summit, we couldn't help but wonder who people would most like to share an airline seat with? While celebrities of the likes of Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, and Beyonce come to mind, it's actually Richard Branson, Nelson Mandela and George Clooney who truly top wishlists. And when it comes to politicians, Barack Obama and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott are the most preferred potential seat mates. Who would you most like to sit next to on an airplane? Barack Obama ranked among the top 10 . Aussies would love a chance to sit next to Virgin founder Richard Branson on a long-haul flight . Australian travel website, Wotif.com, undertook their 'Are You a High Flyer' survey, asking who passengers would prefer to sit next to on a plane. Executive General Manager, Helen Demetriou explained: 'Surprisingly, the top list of potential seat buddies includes more than just popular celebrities, with Abbott making it to seventh place, just beating out Obama in eighth place. 'Top of the wish list is Virgin founder Richard Branson, followed by the late Nelson Mandela, then George Clooney, our very own Hugh Jackman and Pink, with the Dalai Lama just beating Abbott to sixth place. 'There's a range of reasons why people want to share armrests with Abbott, the most popular reason being to give him feedback on issues or voice opinions, followed by questions they'd like to ask the Prime Minister or to get some answers on burning questions.'

'There's no doubt sitting next to Obama on the flight to Brisbane would be something to boast about,' Demetriou continued. 'Some respondents picked Obama to get his tips on public speaking or because they want to know how he became the most powerful man on the planet. 'But it wasn't all business talk - one even chose him to find out if he snores or if he is a chatterbox.' New Zealanders polled were also eager to meet their Prime Minister, with John Key being the third most popular person on the list, following Nelson Mandela and Ritchie McCaw. Wotif.com also asked respondents to reveal what they thought were the most important leadership attributes.

"Some people’s New Year’s resolutions to keep fit could already be falling by the wayside, but a mechanical desk could them work out in the office. The BigRig desk relies on pedal power to charge office gadgets and has been designed to help office workers in shape. Two friends have hand-built a bicycle desk that generates electrical current as a worker pedals, but it will set workers back $2,400 (£1,467) as it is hand-crafted. Scroll down for video . Two friends have hand-built a bicycle desk that generates electrical current as a worker pedals, but the fitness-focused desk will set workers back $2,400 or £1,467 as they are hand crafted . Designed by a start-up company called Pedal Power, the BigRig desk can be used to power computers, or can even be put to more domestic tasks to churn butter or grind grain for beer. The New York-based company was founded by best friends Steve Blood and Andy Wekin, who build pedal-powered machines by hand in their spare time. ‘Human power goes beyond electricity and the primary reason why pedal power is so useful is because two legs can generate eight times more power than one arm with considerably more endurance,' they said. The BigRig desk relies on pedal power to charge office gadgets including computers and mobile phones (pictured) and has been designed to help office workers in shape . For the past five years the duo have designed and developed two main machines - the Big Rig and the Pedal Genny. The Big Rig, a multifunction machine with a built-in seat and work surface, can power nearly anything that uses a v-belt pulley (or chain) and requires less than 1 horsepower. As well as boosting fitness, the desk is designed for off-grid uses for powering tools, which could be useful in a remote workshop or farm. It has an ergonomic seat that can be adjusted to suit different riders, a flywheel to smooth pedalling, a wide range of gearing, and a steel, hand-built frame. An average adult can use it to generate 100 watts of electricity or pump 5 gallons of water a minute as well as to grind a variety of grains, operate an air compressor, a hydraulic pump and a variety of small electrical tools. The Big Rig (pictured), a multifunction machine with a built-in seat and work surface, can power nearly anything that uses a v-belt pulley (or chain) and requires less than 1 horsepower . The Pedal Genny, a smaller and more portable single function machine, can be configured to generate electricity or for other mechanical uses. ‘Our hope is that someday our machines will be as economical and widespread as the bicycle,’ said Mr Blood, who is involved in fundraising $10,000 so that the company can produce kits including step-by-step instructions so that people can build their own desks. The pair said that bicycle technology is ‘nearly perfect’ with 97 per cent efficiency and should be utilised more in everyday tasks. As well as boosting fitness, the desk (pictured) is designed for off-grid uses, in a remote workshop or farm for example, and has an ergonomic seat that can be adjusted to suit different riders, a flywheel to smooth pedalling, a wide range of gearing, and a steel, hand-built frame . ‘Using your own power rather than plugging into the grid is not only fun, but also helps you understand your energy use and reduce your ecological footprint,’ they said. There are a billion bicycles in the world today, which means nearly one in every home. ‘One day, we hope to see every household charging phones, processing food, and pumping water with pedal power,’ said Mr Blood and Mr Welkin. ‘Our machines are hand-built with welded, all-steel frames and stock bicycle parts wherever possible,’ Mr Blood added. An average adult can use it to generate 100 watts of electricity or pump five gallons of water a minute as well as to grind a variety of grains (pictured), operate an air compressor, a hydraulic pump and a variety of small electrical tools . It can take up to four months to build a machine from scratch and the company works with customers to realise any idea for a human-powered contraption, whether that is ‘a multi-person water pumping machine or a single-treadle device for making apple sauce’. While the machines are hand built, the engineers use computer aided design (CAD) technology to produce drawing to ensure a machine fits a customer’s requirements. ‘We aspire to the level of craftsmanship found in the finest bicycles. Our machines are built to last decades or more,’ they said. It can take up to four months to build a machine from scratch and the company works with customers to realise any idea for a human-powered contraption whether that is 'a multi-person water pumping machine or a single-treadle device for making apple sauce'. Here the workings of a water pump attachment are pictured . With today’s hectic pace of life it can be difficult to find the time to exercise. But a U.S. company recently launched TrekDesk - a desk that fits over a treadmill - to enable users to walk slowly while they work. The manufacturer claims the height-adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health, reduce stress, prevent disease and strengthen muscles. Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. Incredibly, it also claims to boost mood and productivity – although it remains hard to fathom how productive typing while walking would be. A statement on the company’s website says: ‘In fact, many studies have shown that your concentration and productivity will increase walking with a treadmill desk. 'You will notice immediately that you do not suffer from the daily bouts of fatigue that may plague you after lunch and later in the day. Increased blood flow to the brain also keeps you sharp and attentive.’ The desk costs £300 and features a manuscript holder, allowing you to read books,or papers while you type, talk and walk. Research published last month found that lounging in a chair for too long without exercising can double the risk of diabetes, heart disease and death. Professor Stuart Biddle, from the University of Loughborough, who was one of the researchers, said office staff should take a stand for health by refusing to sit down at meetings and moving their work station to the nearest filing cabinet. The study, published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, analysed research data on people with different levels of sedentary behaviour. Compared with the least sedentary, those who spent the most time sitting down had a 112 per cent greater risk of diabetes. Similarly, the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes was increased by 147 per cent in the most sedentary, and death linked to heart disease by 90 per cent.","BigRig desk was designed by two friends in New York to boost fitness of workers and provide off-grid energy to power gadgets and tools .

"A cropped version of the controversial image . Police in Tokyo are interviewing a magazine publisher over a photograph showing a young female pop star in an 'inappropriate pose' with a boy. The photograph, showing AKB48 singer Tomomi Kasai, 21, naked with a blond child cupping her breasts from behind, was to be published in Shukan Young Magazine. Publisher Kodansha was planning to run the photograph, which came from a forthcoming book of photographs of the singer, in its weekly manga (or comic-style) magazine earlier this month. But that edition didn't make it to the newsstands, and detectives were called in after concerns were raised that the picture might infringe even Japan's notoriously lax child pornography laws. Tomomi Kasai is a huge star in Japan, where she has been a singer since the age of 14 and is best known for being a part of the phenomenal, 91-strong girl group AKB48. The group - the world's largest - is one of the highest-earning musical acts in the world and recruits new members through Pop Idol-style auditions.  All the girls must be well-behaved, and they perform in a theatre every day, with tickets only available through a heavily-subscribed lottery. Initially Kodansha said the delay in getting the magazine out was due to it containing an 'inappropriate expression' but police said they needed to investigate further and called staff in to be interviewed. Kodansha pulled the photograph and postponed the sale of the magazine from January 12 to January 21.  They also took it out of their planned collection of photographs of the singer. Investigators, who say their first job is to discover if the photograph is real or not, say they will take into consideration the fact that the edition featuring the picture was scrapped before it was published. The Japanese Law Banning Child Prostitution and Child Pornography says that any photo that depicts a child touching the breasts or sexual organs of another individual and which could sexually arouse or stimulate a viewer is defined as child pornography, according to asahi.com. Japanese phenomenon: Tomomi Kasai (sixth from left, back row) is pictured with some of her group AKB48 . The website quoted Toru Okumura, a lawyer who has worked on child pornography cases, saying: 'The Osaka High Court...last July found that if anyone, even a small number of people, became sexually aroused, that would fulfill (the condition in the child pornography definition).' He added: 'Regardless of whether or not a large number of people would become sexually aroused by a photo of a child touching someone else's sexual organs, there is the possibility of the photo being considered pornography.' Japanese website tokyoreporter.com said that the country's child pornography laws stipulated a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of five million yen. It quoted the investigating team as saying: 'In comparison to Japan, penalties in Europe for using a young boy in child pornography are more severe. 'We are taking into account that this could be a problem at an international level.' Kodansha issued an apology, saying: 'In future we will endeavour to do our best to respect the freedom of speech of an author, writer, cartoonist or photographer. 'We are committed to working with more compliance measures in place as we continue to engage in our publishing activities.' Kasai joined AKB48 in 2006 but announced last month that she was planning to 'graduate' from the group. The photograph collection, which will be her first solo book, is entitled 'Tomo no koto, suki?' (Do you like Tomo?) and is expected to be published without the offending image next month.","Manga (or comic-style) Shukan Young magazine scrapped photo of singer .

"When the Duchess of Cambridge first burst onto the royal scene courtesy of a catwalk appearance in a risqué sheer dress, few could have predicted that within a decade, hers would become one of the most talked about wardrobes in the world. Sales of the £780 floor-length Diane von Furstenberg lace gown worn for the Royal Variety Performance last night have gone into orbit, as the American brand becomes the latest beneficiary of what has been dubbed 'the Kate effect'. But fashion fans aren't the only one left swooning by the Duchess of Cambridge's stellar sense of style. Since her marriage four years ago, an army of Kate clones has appeared, among them her own mother and some of European royalty's heaviest hitters. Looks familiar: The Duchess of Cambridge, Spain's Queen Letizia (left) and Denmark's Princess Mary (centre) all have similar style . Copy Kates! Carole Middleton chose a strikingly similar dress for the Royal Variety Performance, while Princess Beatrice loves a bit of lace . The Kate Effect strikes again! Sophie Wessex (far left) in a similar dress at the Festival of Remembrance last Saturday . Lovely in lace: Queen Letizia and the Duchess of Cambridge regularly opt for black lace, as does Kate's sister Pippa Middleton . Carole, who like her daughter chose a black lace dress for the Royal Variety Performance, has form when it comes to taking her pick from Kate and Pippa's wardrobes. Days after the Duchess, dressed in a demure blue spotted dress, left hospital with Prince George, her mother was seen wearing an almost identical frock. But it isn't just Carole - Kate takes style tips from her mother too, and even borrows her clothes. One was a £650 Colette Dinnegan dress, worn by Carole to a wedding in 2009 and by Kate to another in 2011. Another dress loved - and worn - by both was a simple royal blue draped dress by Reiss that made its debut on Carole at Royal Ascot in 2010 and was worn for the second time by the Duchess in 2012. While Carole has unfettered access to Kate's wardrobe, the Duchess' elegant style has also proved a hit with her royal contemporaries, among them Sophie Wessex and Princess Beatrice.

Like Sophie Wessex and Princess Beatrice, Pippa Middleton isn't immune to the lure of the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe . Sophie Wessex, who, pre-2011, boasted a wardrobe remarkable only for its normality, has undergone an impressive makeover in recent years, much of it inspired by her niece-in-law. Like the Duchess, she loves a tailored coat-dress and an elegant hat, which, like Kate, she often buys from up-and-coming milliner, Jane Taylor - who also numbers Princess Beatrice among her clients. Beatrice, 26, has also revamped her style in recent years, swapping frumpy, ageing dresses and the infamous pretzel hat for a succession of glamorous separates and tailored dresses. As with the Duchess of Cambridge, she's partial to a spot of lace and has also chosen similar colour combinations to her cousin-by-marriage with royal blue and cream becoming firm favourites. And it isn't only members of the British royal family who have taken note of the Duchess of Cambridge's elegant look. Others to do so include Queen Letizia of Spain, Crown Princess Mary of Denmark and soon-to-be-royal Sofia Hellqvist, 29, who wore a royal blue dress, strikingly similar to the Issa number worn by Kate, for her engagment photo.

Pretty: Sofia Hellqvist, the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Madeleine of Sweden in surprisingly similar white ensembles . Letizia and Mary, both 42, share the Duchess' love for floor-length lace, tailored shift dresses and nude court shoes, as well as understated 'Hope' earrings by British jewellery brand, Links of London. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, both come from relatively humble backgrounds with Letizia enjoying a successful career as a journalist before marriage, while Mary worked as a marketing manager for an Australian pub. Both have won plaudits for their elegant sense of style in the years since they married and the pair have even been known to dip into each other's wardrobes - on occasion stepping out in identical dresses. Indeed, so successful are they - and Kate - at picking the perfect ensemble whatever the occasion, other royals have begun to take note, with Stéphanie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, 30, sporting grey shift dress for her meeting with Letizia last week that had been worn by the Danish princess seven days before. The Netherlands' Queen Maxima, 43, also favours a tailored style - albeit one enlivened by some seriously eye-catching costume jewels - as does the elegant Queen Mathilde, 41, of Belgium. But of all the royals in Europe, the Swedish royal family is the one that bears the closest resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge, with both Crown Princess Victoria, 37, and her sister Princess Madeleine, 32, opting for increasingly elegant, tailored ensembles in recent years. Like the Danish princess, both love a sequin but as with the Duchess of Cambridge and her mother, lace and elegant shades of navy, cream and royal blue reign supreme.

"Car manufacturers have long sought to create incredibly efficient cars to save motorists money and help the environment. And now engineers at Volkswagen are selling what they claim is the world’s most fuel efficient production car, which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon. The Volkswagen XL1 ‘super efficient vehicle’ features new construction techniques, an innovative futuristic-looking body and hybrid drive-train to dramatically increase fuel economy. Scroll down for video . Engineers at Volkswagen have made what they claim is the world's most fuel efficient production car, which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon . The two-seat diesel-electric hybrid car emits 24 g/km of carbon dioxide, which the German auto manufacturer says sets a new benchmark for vehicle efficiency. The car's fuel efficiency of 313 miles per gallon compares favourably with Toyota's Prius, which typically does 44mpg in city driving conditions and Ford's Fiesta, which does 31mpg on average. In theory, it could be driven from the centre of London to the outskirts of Edinburgh in a straight line, using just one gallon of fuel. The XL1 was designed from scratch and is lightweight as some steel components, including the chassis, have been replaced by carbon fibre so that the car weighs in at just 795kg. The Volkswagen XL1 'super efficient vehicle' features new construction techniques, an innovative futuristic-looking body and hybrid drive-train to dramatically increase fuel economy . The car can do 313 miles per gallon. It combines new construction techniques, a super aerodynamic design and a hybrid-drive train to be so fuel efficient. The two-seat diesel-electric hybrid car emits 24 g/km of carbon dioxide. It weighs in at just 795kg and has 'scissor doors' It measures almost four metres long, 1.7metres wide and just 1.2metres tall. It is powered by a compact 800 cc two-cylinder diesel engine and together with the 20kW electric motor. In pure electric mode, the XL1 can travel up to 35km before the diesel engine cuts in. The car can go from 0-60mph in 11.9 seconds and has an electronically limited top speed of 99mph . Just 200 of the cars are on sale and cost €111,000 (£92,490) as they are hand crafted. The edgy design is intended to reduce drag and it features ‘scissor doors’  which were famously featured in the DeLorean DMC-12, used in the Back to the Future films. To achieve the target fuel consumption figure the XL1 was aerodynamically optimised, adopting a classic ‘tear drop’ shape and using innovations such as removing traditional wing mirrors and replacing them with small cameras called e-Mirrors, which transmit exterior images to interior displays.

"Ten children a day are suspended or expelled from school because of incidents involving weapons including knives, air guns, chisels and knuckledusters. Pupils and teachers were threatened or attacked in a string of incidents over the past year, some involving pepper spray and razor blades, a disturbing survey has found. In Essex, a pupil took a knife to school and held it to another child’s throat. Another pupil was expelled for throwing a fire extinguisher at a headmaster. A survey has revealed that ten children are being kicked out of school every day for bringing weapons to school, with most coming from London (file picture) A child in Leicester stole the emergency hammer from a school minibus and threatened fellow pupils with it. And in Birmingham, pupils were disciplined for bringing machetes, knives and pepper spray to school. One student was expelled for whipping his teacher with a rope, while another attacked a fellow student with a knuckleduster. In West Sussex, a student was suspended after attacking two pupils with a chisel. In Croydon, South London, a pupil shot another with a BB air gun. A survey of councils in England after a Freedom of Information request found 57 out of 150 had received reports from local schools of pupils excluded temporarily or permanently for incidents involving weapons, many of them potentially lethal. Altogether last year there were 594 incidents. But only a third of councils hold this information as they are not required to by the Department for Education, so across the country the total would be around 1,800 – or ten children per school day. Academies and free schools do not supply information about incidents at school to their council. Chris McGovern, chairman of the . Campaign for Real Education and a former state school history teacher . and headmaster of a successful prep school, said: ‘Schools should be . safe and secure places for staff and pupils. 'Where . violence reigns, self-preservation, not education, is the order of the . day. The fact is there are few deterrents for delinquent kids. Former headteacher Chris McGovern, said that while violence is coming into schools, self-preservation gets in the way of education . ‘A child who is a danger to others in school should be educated in an isolation unit until we can be fairly sure that he or she no longer poses a threat.’ The greatest number of violent incidents at schools during the 2012/13 academic year – by both adults and children – was in London which had 112, followed by 14 in the West Midlands. Tower Hamlets council in East London had a report of a pupil coming to school armed with four replica guns and ammunition. The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year that 40 primary school pupils are expelled for attacking staff every day. There were 8,000 expulsions in just one year – a 15 per cent rise in 12 months. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘It is totally unacceptable for pupils to threaten other pupils and teachers with weapons. ‘That is why we have put  teachers back in charge of  discipline. Teachers can now issue no-notice detentions, search pupils without consent for weapons, and use force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom.’","In the last year 594 incidents were reported by 57 English councils .
However only a third of local authorities keep track of this data .

"The Prince of Wales was celebrating his 66th birthday today but chose to spend it working, with a visit to the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon. But he did get a birthday present in the shape of a 62-gun Royal salute from members of Honourable Artillery Company in London, a second from the Royal Artillery and third from Scottish Gunners of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery in Scotland. Charles, however, was not in London or Edinburgh to witness the display, as he had travelled to Warwickshire to visit the Royal Shakespeare Company of which he is patron. Happy Birthday Prince Charles: The heir to the throne celebrated his 66th birthday today . Boom! Members of the Honourable Artillery Company unleash a 62-gun salute outside the Tower of London . And again! Scottish Gunners of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery fire a 21-gun salute at Edinburgh Castle . The visit, which was to present long service awards to members of the company, also saw him attend its AGM. The Prince of Wales is one of only three members of the Royal Family whose birthday is marked with a cannon salute, the others being the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Royal salutes are fired by members of the Honourable Artillery Company and the Royal Horse Artillery in London, with the latter going first and firing their cannons in Hyde Park. A basic Royal salute involves 21 rounds but an extra 20 are added in Hyde Park because of its royal status. A further 20 are added at the Tower of London, again because of its royal connections, and another 21 for the City of London.

The men of the King's Troop Royal Artillery perform a 41-gun salute in Prince Charles' honour . And again! A second round is fired in Hyde Park, which gets 20 extra shots because of its royal status . As a result, the Tower holds the record for the most guns fired in a single salute, which takes place on the 10th June when the Queen's official birthday coincides with the Duke of Edinburgh's real one. In total, 124 shots are fired by the King's Troop, Royal Artillery from their perch beside the Thames in the Tower grounds. But London isn't the only place in the UK to resound with the sound of cannon fire on royal birthdays and anniversaries. As the soldiers of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery demonstrated, Edinburgh Castle, Cardiff and Hillsborough Castle in County Down in Northern Ireland also host military salutes. Other anniversaries marked by cannon salutes include Accession Day, Coronation Day and the State Opening of Parliament. The moment a visiting head of state meets the Queen at Windsor, in London or Edinburgh is also marked with cannon fire. Next! The Honourable Artillery Company performed the second royal salute of the day . Busy: The Company fires the biggest salute - 124 shots for the Queen and Prince Philip on 10th June . Royal salute: Today's royal salute involved 62 shots, including 20 for the Tower of London . Bang! A cannon roars into life from its perch on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle .

"Charlotte Urie, 20, was shocked after her boyfriend Kieran said he was born a girl. But the Londoner quickly recovered and they've been together since 2012 . Everyone expects to finds a few skeletons in the closet when they start dating a new person. But Charlotte Urie, 20, was left shocked after her boyfriend confessed he was actually born a girl. With his strong jawline and muscly torso, Charlotte had no clue that the new man in her life - Kieran Moloney - had come into this world as a female called Ciara. For years, the 23-year-old kept his sex-swap a secret, until he met Charlotte in 2012. The couple have now been together for two years and are hoping to marry and start a family using Kieran's best friend as a sperm donor. Charlotte, a barista from Camden, London, said: 'I would never have guessed Kieran's secret, but as soon as he told me he'd been born a girl it didn't matter to me. 'I was surprised, but I love him for who he is and see him as a man. 'He's very masculine and has a great body, but he's also my best friend. 'I never had any concerns about dating someone transgender. Biology doesn't matter.' Kieran, originally from New Zealand, but now living in London, said: 'When I first met Charlotte, I was blown away by her beauty, but I was terrified of how she'd react if she found out I used to be a girl. 'I needed to know I could trust her, before I revealed my secret. 'Other girlfriends have been ashamed of who I am, but when I told Charlotte, she was so accepting. She's amazing.' Kieran is yet to have full gender reassignment surgery, but the couple say Kieran's physical gender doesn't get in the way of them enjoying a healthy sex life. He says: 'We've reached the stage where we feel comfortable enough with each other to do whatever feels good - that's what sex is.' Kieran has been living as a man for seven years and after having a double mastectomy at 20, he finally feels comfortable in his own skin. Kieran, 23, from New Zealand and Charlotte now live together in north London and the couple are hoping to marry . Kieran, who also works as a Barista, had been unhappy with his gender since he was four years old. He had no interest in girly things and cried if his Mum put him in a dress and when he started primary school, he became a target for bullies. He said: 'Kids didn't understand why I was different. I had no friends and I changed schools five times. 'The only time I was happy was when people mistook me for a boy.' When puberty hit, the teenager's confusing feelings just escalated further. He says: 'I hated seeing my breasts develop and I was jealous of the boys at school when their voices dropped and they started shaving. I hated being a girl.' Kieran was born as girl called Ciara (right), but since the age of four he has been unhappy with his gender . At 14, Kieran lost his virginity to a boy, but says it felt wrong. He cut his hair into a short spiky bob and wore sports bras and baggy tops to hide his feminine figure. After seeing a counselor aged 16, Kieran was finally diagnosed as transgender. He said: 'I started taking hormone tablets which lowered my voice and gave me more body hair - I loved the changes.' Kieran's family supported him and his mother Bronagh Moloney, 49, a nurse, began calling him her son. By 17, fine hairs started to grow on Kieran's face and with a rigorous gym workout, Kieran's body was transforming into a man's. In his teens, Kieran began binding his breasts with sports tape, spending £20 a week in his quest to hide any hint of being a woman. At 18, he had a £5,000 double mastectomy . He began binding his breasts with sports tape, spending £20 a week in his quest to hide any hint of being a woman. Gradually, his cup size dropped from a B to an A. In November 2009, aged 18, Kieran started monthly testosterone injections and, two years later, had a £5,000 double mastectomy that was paid for by his mum. He said: 'When I saw the results I felt euphoric. I finally had a man's upper body, something I'd only dreamed about.' In August 2012, Kieran changed his name by deed poll and met girlfriend, Charlotte. In August 2012, Kieran changed his name by deed poll and met girlfriend, Charlotte . Charlotte says: 'We both loved the same music and were into keeping fit. 'He's a man's man and loves football and going to the pub.' The couple started dating and a month later Kieran confessed how he had been born a girl and was transgender. Charlotte says: 'Kieran sat me down and said he had something to tell me. He then blurted out that he'd been born a girl called Ciara. 'I was so surprised. He was so manly. I never had any suspicions. 'Kieran was really nervous and told me he'd understand if I just wanted to be friends. Kieran's family supported him and his mother Bronagh Moloney, 49, a nurse, began calling him her son when he turned 16 . 'We talked it through for hours. 'I knew I still loved him and wanted to be with him. It didn't matter he'd been born a girl.' Kieran added: 'So many girlfriends before had been embarrassed by me and I didn't want any more rejection. 'I felt such a connection to Charlotte and I didn't want her to end the relationship, so when she reacted like it was nothing, I felt so relieved. 'Finally I met someone who liked me for me.' A few weeks later, the couple became intimate for the first time. Charlotte says: 'Kieran wasn't shy about showing off his body - he' has got a great six pack. 'He was completely comfortable and I made sure he was at ease.' Kieran with his best friend Sam . Two months later they moved in together and now the couple are planning to tie the knot and have children together. Charlotte said: 'Kieran's my soulmate and we'd be the best parents. 'We'll explain his background to our kids when they're old enough - they'll have two loving parents, that's the most important thing.' Kieran says: 'People can't believe I used to be a girl, and neither can I.

"Justin Bieber has a reputation for trouble. But this man makes it his life's work to keep the 20-year-old on the right track. Meet Carl Lentz, the tattooed, Mohawked pastor flanked by an 11-piece rock band, who sermonizes to U2, raps the gospel, and dresses almost exclusively in denim and leather. Close: Carl Lentz (right) with Justin Bieber and a friend 'talking bout our saviour Jesus Christ' over lunch . Unconventional: Lentz uses rap and rock music to deliver his sermons at Hillsong Church in Manhattan, NYC . 'I have a special role in Justin’s life, spiritually, but...I’m not a life-motivational guy,' Lentz told the New York Post. 'We’re talking about making sure his life remains a blessing, not a burden.' Justin has proudly publicized his trips to Lentz's Hillsong Church in New York, which runs six services every Sunday. Last Sunday, the singer - who is currently on probation for egging his neighbor's home earlier this year - dropped by with celebrity pals Kendall Jenner, 19, and Hailey Baldwin, 17, for a high-octane day of rest. In previous visits, he has taken on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez. His numerous Twitter posts gushing about Lentz include one revealing that a sermon caused him to break down in tears. Chilling out: He has grown close to Bieber, now 20, after they met when the singer was 14 at a church service . 'Special role': He said he has vowed to support Bieber to help him 'make it' through his troubled moments . 'Love to my guy @carllentzNYC for the amazing sermon at church this morning. Love you man. I broke down today. Thank (you),' he wrote in 2013, attaching a picture of that pair beaming together. He also shares pictures of the pair playing basketball, going for coffee, and chilling out in the sun. 'Me and my homies @ryangood24 and @carllentz at lunch talking bout our saviour Jesus Christ,' was one caption on a surly selfie. Lentz, a former Gucci store greeter who now counts Ja Rule, Bono, and Vanessa Hudgens among his congregation, discovered Justin at the advent of his career, when the singer was just 14 years old. 'I remember being involved in this preservice prayer [backstage] and just looking at him and going, ""This is going to be a challenge,""' says Lentz, who was overwhelmed by the commotion surrounding the then-14-year-old. 'Challenge': Lentz says he remembers thinking it was going to be tough for Bieber even as a young teenager . 'Journey': The 34-year-old said Bieber is 'on a journey' so shouldn't be judged for his discrepancies . 'And that day being like, 'I'm going to pray for this boy to make it.""' In the years since, the singer has become a core feature of Lentz's life, even staying over at the New Jersey home Lentz shares with his wife and three children. But the past six years have nonetheless been shaky for Justin. Hisbrawl with Orlando Bloom, appearance outside a brothel, turbulent love life, apparent racial slurs and misdemeanors have been the subject of global fascination. 'He’s on a journey,' explains Lentz, who also partied and went 'off course' while studying criminal law at North Carolina State. 'If he’s not doing good, should we abandon him?' Friends: Lentz (left) and Bieber (right) play basketball together and Bieber hangs out with Lentz's family . Fans: Lentz supports Justins music and hung this to celebrate his friend and congregation member's success . Instead he tries to instill faith in him with the energetic and 'hipster' services. After a little more than three years, Hillsong estimates it draws 8,000 people to Sunday services each week. Crowds lining up are a regular weekly scene at Irving Plaza near Manhattan’s Union Square. Hillsong often has to add additional evening sessions, which could last well into the night. At one service, he broke out Coolio lyrics. At another he called the biblical Saul the ‘LeBron James of Judaism.’ He is an avid basketball fan and player, and is a fixture at New York Knicks games. In others, he is emotional. After a little more than three years, Hillsong estimates it draws 8,000 people to Sunday services each week in Hammerstein Ballroom off Union Square in New York City's Manhattan . 'Can you look at the person to your left and say ""you look great today""?' he says during service, to a room full of laughter (followed by a chorus of 'you look great today'). He admits that they amassed many members of the congregation who came in to see what everyone was queuing up for. 'People would come in and say ""what's going on?"". And our people are smart enough to just say ""oh just come in it's great! Free drinks!"" Or whatever. 'Some guy'll ask ""are there girls in there?"". We're like ""oh yeah, tons of girls!"".'","Carl Lentz, 34, met Justin Bieber in 2007 and vowed to help him 'make it'

"The remains of 86 unborn babies which should have been cremated within months were kept at an NHS hospital for up to four years, it has emerged. Managers at Walsall Manor Hospital, in the West Midlands, have apologised and launched a full investigation after the scandal came to light following an internal review. It shows there were a 86 occasions where remains from miscarriages or abortions were kept for longer than they should have been. Managers at Walsall Manor Hospital, in the West Midlands, have apologised after the remains of 86 unborn babies which should have been cremated within months were kept for up to four years . Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust blamed an administrative error and said only five women will be contacted - because records indicate they would want to be informed. The other 81 women will  not be contacted in order to avoid 'widespread distress'. The storage of fetal remains were revealed under a . Freedom of Information request by Channel 4 Dispatches. The show, presented by Amanda Holden, investigates the treatment of couples . whose pregnancies end in failure. Around 700 foetal remains are kept at Walsall Manor Hospital every year until the appropriate paperwork has been completed. They are usually stored in the hospital's mortuary for between one and three months and then in the vast majority of occasions they are sent to be cremated. But an error in getting documents signed off led to the remains in the 86 cases being kept for up to four years. Two of the 86 cases date back to 2010, with another two in 2011, a total of 30 in 2012 and then 52 up to December 2013. In 73 cases they belonged to foetuses under 12-weeks-old with with the remaining 13 being under 21 weeks. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust blamed an administrative error and said only five women will be contacted - because records indicate they would want to be informed . Richard Kirby, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust which runs the hospital, has apologised. He said: 'It is clear that in some . cases the trust has kept remains following terminations and miscarriages . for longer than we should have done. 'I . would like to apologise to each and every patient who has been affected . by this and would like to re-assure anyone who might be using our . services now or in the future of our dedication in ensuring that this . situation does not arise again. 'We are confident we have contacted everyone we need to in relation to this issue. 'There are five of the 86 who we think we should contact. 'For the others, the feel of all the advice we have taken and all the work we have done, we risk causing more distress by making contact. 'We will now be proceeding to arrange the cremations in line with our standard policy.' Mr Kirby also said that without the relevant certification, the hospital was unable to release the remains for cremation. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust which runs the hospital, has now issued an apology and an investigation is underway . But he vowed to look into the full reasons behind what went wrong in the 86 cases which have been discovered. He added: 'We have asked for an independent review. We want a really thorough understanding of what went wrong.' The results of the independent review are expected at the end of April this year and the hospital has received advice from the Miscarriage Association and bereavement teams on how to contact and support patients. It has said it will 'appropriately dispose' of the 86 foetal remains through the crematorium in line with 'usual processes'. Yesterday Labour MP for Walsall North, David Winnick demanded a full inquiry into the matter. He said: 'I find this very puzzling and distressing. 'There needs to be a full explanation and if necessarily a full inquiry. 'It will come as a shock to the people in the borough and understandably so.'

"When you're in the grip of new love a little public display of affection might seem harmless. You could even be the most discreet of loved-up couples but when you're head over heels for one another you might find yourself unable to resist holding hands or even kissing in public. But while a subtle smooch or romantic gesture might seem like a scene from a Hollywood film in your head, onlookers may see it quite differently. How you think you look: PDA may seem like a harmless show of love for one another, even when demonstrated in front of complete strangers . What you really look like: But it can make most people feel quite uncomfortable, especially if they are more conservative by nature . A writer from the Bold Italic was faced with one of the most awkward PDAs we've ever heard of in a local Whole Foods, which made her feel supremely uncomfortable. 'When I walked in, a couple in the middle of the prepared-foods section was already embracing and mashing tongues together with such fervour, and for so incredibly long, that they essentially added an extra T to the Hot Bar,' writes Jessica Saia, from Chicago, in a new article for the website. 'At first, I thought, ""Sure, I get it. The mac and cheese, the sweating condensation on the sneeze guards: no one's arguing it isn't sexy"". But later that same trip, another couple was making out with abandon directly in front of the cured meats, and I really needed to get in there. God, it was like his mouth was the mortar and her tongue was the pestle. 'I tried to avoid entering the splash zone of saliva while blindly grabbing at a package of prosciutto, barely being able to ascertain which option was the cheapest. But they were completely unaware of my presence. With their eyes closed and clinging to each other's faces, they clearly pictured the scene as a romantic one - close cropped and soft focused, with bits of blue cheese crumbling around them like snowflakes and some Seal song playing in their heads drowning out the wet slap of their gums. 'It wasn't like that - not to me.' And so with the Bold Italic's stable of photographers at her disposal, she enlisted snapper Tom Kubik to capture a series of posed-up PDAs we recognise all too well, in an attempt to capture how you may think your PDA looks compared to how the rest of the world sees it. The resulting images represented couples lost in the moment with only eyes for each other - feeding each other popcorn, kissing a lady's hand like an English gentleman and sharing a Lady and the Tramp spaghetti moment in an Italian restaurant. How you think you look: A couple share popcorn while giggling in a cinema . But the 'reality' half of the images showed a caricature of those moments, exaggerated to magnify how awkward they can be for everyone else when put into the context of a public setting. While they may be a little extreme and created in light humour to prove a point, PDA can certainly make people feel quite anxious and even queasy, especially those who are more conservative, reserved - or perhaps single. A hand innocently placed on the lower back can easily slide down to bottom level, and a peck on the lips can progress into a French kiss when you're feeling passionate. So to avoid making others feel uncomfortable, it may be a good idea to hold off until you get home.","Public displays of affection can seem innocent to couples in love .

"Pure? New Zealand's poor environmental record has cast doubt on its claims to be '100% Pure' For a country that markets itself to the world with the slogan '100% Pure', New Zealand's environmental credentials are not as impeccable as many would think. The majority of its rivers are too polluted to swim in. Its record on preservation of natural environments is among the worst in the world on a per capita basis. And it is the only OECD country that does not produce a regular national report on its environment. The discovery by dairy giant Fonterra of a bacteria that can cause potentially fatal food poisoning in ingredients sold to eight countries exposes New Zealand's vulnerability to food safety scares and the fragility of the clean, green image underpinning its farming- and tourism-based economy. Agricultural exports, including dairy, meat, fruit and wine, command high premiums internationally thanks to New Zealand's reputation as a producer of safe, natural and high-quality food. 'It was only a matter of time before our dirty little secret came out,' said Jill Brinsdon, brand strategist at Radiation, a brand agency in Auckland. 'Fonterra is our largest exporter and they're completely intertwined with New Zealand's image and also they're the absolute biggest benefactor of the ""100% Pure"" brand. 'When you're coming out with something that presents itself as fact, or 100 per cent pure, then you have to be 100 per cent pure and we've proven that we're not.' New Zealand's primary sector, which includes fishing and forestry, accounts for some 60 per cent of exports and 18 per cent of the country's $160billion GDP, among the highest proportions in the developed world. Tourism makes up another 10 percent or so of GDP. The country has long marketed itself internationally with the '100% Pure' slogan in print and TV ads, drawing millions of visitors each year to experience its national parks, beaches and lakes. Pollution: Early morning light shines through the smog in Christchurch, New Zealand . Contaminated: A notice warning of industrial liquid pollution in the Waimakariri river, Christchurch in New Zealand . With barely 4.5 million people spread over a mountainous area larger than the United Kingdom or California and more than a quarter of that set aside for reserves and national parks - the backdrop for the popular Lord of the Rings movie trilogy - New Zealand has no shortage of unspoilt natural attractions. But the marketing overlooks a dark side to the country's environmental credentials. More than 60 per cent of New Zealand rivers monitored by the Environment Ministry had 'poor' or 'very poor' water quality and were rated as unsafe for swimming due to pollution. Dairy farming, which has a lot riding on New Zealand's strong environmental reputation, has been a significant cause of poor river quality due to fertiliser and effluent runoff. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand cows are kept on grassy pastures year-round, a major selling point for its $9billion annual global dairy trade. The country has long marketed itself internationally with the '100% Pure' slogan in print and TV ads, drawing millions of visitors each year to experience its national parks, beaches and lakes . Facade: New Zealand trades off its natural beauty, but many rivers are too polluted to swim in . Fonterra Kauri plant in Whangarei. A botulism scare at Fonterra was the company's second contamination issue this year after it earlier found traces of dicyandiamde, a potentially toxic chemical, in some products . 'Because we've had a lack of regulation . on farm waste for 20 years it's been a free for all, so farmers have . done what they can to produce more milk - which is to put more cows on . pastures,' said Mike Joy, an ecology and environmental sustainability . scientist at Massey University. Prime Minister John Key, who has been previously criticised for saying the 100% Pure marketing should be taken with a pinch of salt, said New Zealand would always be reliant on dairying, with its natural competitive advantage and global demand rising. 'The right answer is not for New Zealand to sell less dairy. The right answer is for New Zealand to be absolutely sure that the safety standards are met,' he said on Tuesday. More than 60 per cent of New Zealand rivers monitored by the Environment Ministry had 'poor' or 'very poor' water quality . While separate from its environmental credentials, New Zealand's food safety record is also not without stain. Until the late 2000s, New Zealand had the highest rate in the developed world of food-borne campylobacteriosis, a serious and sometimes deadly disease caused by a bacteria often found in uncooked chicken. By 2011, even after a major government initiative to control the epidemic, New Zealand still reported incidents of the disease at more than double the rate of nearby Australia and 12 times the rate of the United States, according to the University of Otago. The botulism scare at Fonterra was the company's second contamination issue this year after it earlier found traces of dicyandiamde, a potentially toxic chemical, in some products. Even so, New Zealand has one of the most stringent food safety regimes in the world and the recent dairy product scares only turned up with the sophisticated and sensitive testing available. Fonterra expects the current contamination issue to be resolved within days. A protracted, major animal health incident, rather than a localised contamination issue, could wreak havoc on the New Zealand economy. A decade ago, at the height of a foot and mouth epidemic in Europe, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand modelled the impact of a limited outbreak of the livestock disease - estimating an immediate 20 per cent hit to the currency, as well as a 12 per cent fall in exports and an eight per cent hit to GDP in two years. 'We've got to wake up and look more closely at our green credentials, and work harder to create a pristine environment so consumers can get a product which matches the story,' said a consultant to New Zealand companies operating in Asia. 'We can't be complacent.'","Despite marketing claims, New Zealand has a poor environmental record .

"Al Roker has earned himself a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Today anchor has broken the record for the longest weathercast ever, after 34 straight hours of non-stop weather updates. Starting on Wednesday evening, he officially accomplished the feat early Friday during his daily appearance on Today. Scroll down for video . Record holder: Al Roker is presented with a plaque after breaking the world record for longest weathercast ever . Long shift: The Today anchor's meteorology marathon lasted 34 straight hours . Getting some rest: As part of the rules, Roker was allowed a five minute break every hour . Roker was so dedicated to the task at hand, dubbed Rokerthon, that he at one point forgot to turn off his microphone while he went to the bathroom. He immediately acknowledged the incident, joking, 'We gave new meaning to live stream.' The weatherman had visits from celebs including Alan Alda, Candace Bergen, Aaron Sorkin and Nick Lachey during his marathon of meteorology, and kept fans updated on social media with an hourly photo, looking slightly more maniacal with each passing hour. His Today co-anchor Willie Geist noted as much, saying, 'He's got crazy eyes.' He also had the company of a revolving door of college students, who sat off camera and were hired as the required witnesses for the attempt, and Norwegian weathercaster Eli Kari Gjengedal, the previous record holder. Proud team: His co-anchors were there to congratulate him when he accomplished his feat . Keeping him honest: A team of college students were hired to be official witnesses during the event . No doubt helping Roker out was the severe weather happening across the country this week, with temperatures plummeting and a massive snowstorm blanketing the Pacific Northwest. Roker even admitted as much, saying, 'I don't know when I've had this much weather to talk about all over the country. It makes it easy.'

"This incredible series of images captured in the reflection of a bubble is enough to blow your mind. Inspired by the film Blade Runner where a whole landscape is reflected in a human eye, patient photographer Richard Heeks has spent years mastering his art in Exeter, Devon. Mr Heeks, 39, has captured the exact moment a bubble bursts as well as snapping bubbles within other bubbles. Scroll down for video . Unusual: A beautiful countryside scene was captured in the prefect circle of the bubbles . Stunning: The series of images were inspired by Blade Runner where a landscape was reflected in an android's eye to give a new perspective of the world . World: Photographer Richard Heeks, seen here centre, captured the world in a bubble as he experimented with photography . But his latest work is spectacularly original and all shot close to home. He said: 'Most of my bubble photos were taken in my garden in Exeter where I was living a couple of years ago.'My house was in the rural grounds of a beautiful old red brick lunatic asylum that had been converted into housing.' Eerie: Branches captured in this shot resemble the iris of an eye, like the Blade Runner shot from the ground-breaking movie which inspired the photographer . Colours: The bubble gave a new way of looking at the world, showing a strange beauty and impressive view of the landscape . 'There were lots of beautiful things to reflect, such as the red brick buildings and large old trees.'After buying a cheap digital camera in 2005, Mr Heek's obsession with photography grew and he now takes pictures wherever and whenever he can upgrading his camera every two years. And when he isn't doing that he enjoys blogging about photography. He has made a name for himself by setting up spectacular images of  bubbles. The keen photographer uses a  £500 Nikon D7000 digital camera and uses no other equipment buts light and dark areas to create strong reflections - using sun light or bright lights from buildings. He said: 'I tend to use the sun or bright buildings for light.  I use dark and shadowed or secluded areas for a dark background. Hedges block light to create shade, as do trees, walls and buildings. I love relying on nature. I think the best shots tend to be natural.' Reflection: Painstaking photographer Richard Heeks was captured in a landscape reflected by a bubble as the viewer catches a glimpse of the cameraman at work . Control: Patient photographer Richard Heeks can be seen holding the bubble as he took the shot and directed the image . He added: 'I have to surround myself with patient types as it can be a one in a thousand shot to get it just right.'I don't' use any technology to capture my spectacular images. 'I'd love to photograph people one day in the future - to be a portrait photographer.' Perspective: Photographer Richard Heeks captured the transitory image of the world reflected before the bubble burst . Vase: This bubble shaped like a vase reflected vibrant colours and showed the skill of the cameraman who had to act quickly to take the shot . Perfect circle: The shades of a beautiful night time view had a fresh glow when it was caught reflected on the bubble . Influential: Richard Heeks was inspired by the imagery of  Ridley Scott's cult 1982 movie Blade Runner, with the landscape reflected in the eye of an android .","Patient photographer Richard Heeks spent hours setting up his unusual shots .

"This is the hilarious moment a dog driving a Segway was photographed taking his owner for a walk. A series of surreal images captured by a passing motorist show a white dog driving down a street on a Segway as its owner runs alongside it. Remarkably, the dog was adept at manoeuvring the machine, which is controlled by its driver's shifts in body weight. Leaning forwards takes the Segway forward, while leaning back slows it down. The owner was photographed running along beside the dog as it drove the electric Segway . A passing motorist quickly pulled out his mobile phone in order to capture the surreal moment .

"Kirk Cameron is on a mission to make sure no one loses their joy this holiday season. The sometime actor and full-time evangelical Christian recently posted a video on his Facebook page for all the ladies out there, and he knows just what they need to make this Christmas truly special - cooking, cleaning, singing and decorating. He also wants them to know that they are 'irreplaceable.' Scroll down for videos . Hey Ladies: Kirk Cameron (above) has declared cooking, cleaning, decorating and singing the keys to a joyful Christmas for every woman in the world . Christ almighty: The actor is also suggesting everyone check out his new film Kirk Cameron's Surviving Christmas, which is in theaters now . 'Calling all moms, wives and keepers of your home - I made this video for you, to remind you of how irreplaceable you are to your family this Christmas,' says Cameron to his 2 million followers. 'If you are a mom, if you are a wife, if you're the keeper of your home, I want you to know that your joy is so important this Christmas.' Joy is what Christmas is all about according to Cameron, and stolen joy can sap a person's strength he explains, before declaring the best way for a woman to experience joy during this very special time of the year. 'Let your children, your family, see your joy in the way that you decorate your home this Christmas, in the food that you cook, the songs you sing, the stories you tell, and the traditions that you keep,' says Cameron. 'Invite your whole neighborhood into your Christmas, and invite the world into our story of our king and his kingdom.' He then plugs his new movie, which is in theaters today, Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas. The Los Angeles Times is calling the film an 'unholy mess,' while the Chicago Sun-Times declares it 'one of the least artful holiday films ever made.' Devoted husband: Cameron has been married to wife Chelsea Noble (above) for 23 years . Cameron also took some time to talk to all of his male followers, and again promote his film, in a second video on his Facebook page this week. This time around it was less about joy, and more about what the manly thing to do is this holiday season. 'Men. Fathers. Husbands. Sons. Our example in our family's life is so important at Christmastime. So be all in this year. Don't be a Bah Humbug. Support the women in your life,' says the former Growing Pains star. 'Put up the lights, prepare the house, and realize how blessed you are. Remember, Jesus came to serve. And so should you and I.' Cameron also has ideas for other things men can do this Christmas. 'You know what the really manly thing to do this Christmas is? How about the dishes?! Or give your wife a good foot massage. That would be awesome! Because I'm thinking, she deserves it,' says Cameron. 'And you know what another amazing thing you could do is? Take your whole family and see Saving Christmas.' Former glory: Cameron shot to fame playing Mike Seaver on the popular show Growing Pains (above with Leonardo DiCaprio) And for those who don't manage to catch Saving Christmas in theaters, but are hoping to see Cameron back in the spotlight, he will likely be making a television cameo on the popular reality series 19 Kids and Counting in the very near future as he attended the wedding of Jessa Duggar earlier this month. Cameron declared Duggar's decision to not even kiss her future husband before their wedding day admirable, and took his two teenage daughters with him so they could see what he deemed a very special moment. Kissing has long been incredibly sacred to Cameron, with the actor refusing to even kiss other women while filming, and demanding his wife Chelsea Noble serve as a stand-in for all scenes that require any tonsil hockey.","Kirk Cameron recorded a message explaining how women could have the most possible joy this holiday season .

Sporting a variety of classic and stylish designs from the label’s Permanent collection, the teen model showcases the same pouty lips and high cheekbones that his father first became famous for while starring in films such as Batman Forever and Top Gun. Jack, who is also a budding actor, made his modeling debut in June, when he walked in the brand's spring/summer 2015 'Psych Rock' show. Scroll down for video .

But the Los Angeles resident's first breakout role came last year, when director Gia Coppola cast him opposite Emma Roberts in Palo Alto, her cinematic adaptation of James Franco's short story collection of the same name. In April, he told The Huffington Post that he didn't always want a career in showbusiness, but fell in love with acting while filming the teen drama. 'It’s funny, people asked me as a kid all the time, ""Do you want to do what your parents do?"" And I always said no, because it's different, I don’t know, to be stubborn or something. Because I was a normal kid,' he said. Back to basics: Jack made his modeling debut in June, when he walked in the brand's spring/summer 2015 menswear show .

Miss Coppola praised Jack's performance in the film, telling Teen Vogue: 'Jack is a natural, and Val and I made sure this was his film.' Jack, whose mother is British actress Joanne Whalley, is slated to appear in two more films next year: indie drama Len and Company, and romantic comedy Aaron Baby Superfecta, which co-stars Elle Fanning.

"Victim: Azelle Rodney, 24, was killed during a police 'hard stop' in north London in April 2005 . A policeman shouted ‘sweet as’ moments after his colleague gunned down a suspect, an inquiry heard yesterday. Azelle Rodney, 24, died instantly when he was shot six times in a busy high street. The rounds were fired from the open window of a patrol car within a split second of it pulling alongside the VW Golf carrying Rodney. The firearms officer – known only as E7 – was sitting in the front seat and let off eight shots after police in another car had forced the Golf to slow down. They believed that Rodney and the two men with him had machine guns and were on their way to rob Colombian drug dealers. In a dramatic recording of the incident, played yesterday to a long awaited inquiry into the case, a police officer in a car tailing the suspects says: ‘We’re going in.’ Moments later, the firearms officer starts shooting and then the policeman in another car appears to say: ‘Sweet as, sweet as’. No words of warning from the armed officers can be heard on the video. Details of the killing emerged on the first day of an inquiry into the death in Edgware, North London, on April 30, 2005. It is the first time this type of hearing has been held to examine the evidence of a fatal shooting by police officers. Held instead of an inquest, it is taking place in the High Court in London in front of Sir Christopher Holland. A coroner ruled in 2007 that his court could not see relevant intelligence material, thought to come from phone taps. Police guard the scene: Azelle Rodney, 24, was killed during a police 'hard stop' in north London in April 2005 . Officials hope the public hearing will dampen any accusations of a police and political cover-up. Rodney’s family may find they are left with unanswered questions however because the method by which intelligence was gathered will not be revealed during the hearing. Yesterday Ashley Underwood, QC, counsel for the inquiry, played a video recording, captured by another officer, of  the ‘hard stop’ performed by a convoy of unmarked police cars driving through suburban streets just after 7.30pm. As they follow the Golf, one officer says: ‘We’re looking to do it at the roundabout, if he stops.’ Moments . after the car stops, shots can be heard. However, pictures of the . shooting were not captured on the video. Mr Underwood said Rodney was . killed ‘more or less instantly’. When ballistics experts examined the car they found a Colt .45 calibre pistol on the driver’s side of the back seat, partly covered in plastic. It was incapable of firing and was . not loaded, although three rounds of suitable ammunition were found in a . plastic bag on the floor of the car. Two . other guns were found in a rucksack in the back footwell – a Baikal . pistol wrapped in a scarf that was loaded but its safety catch was on, . and another which was wrapped in a glove. Search: Forensic officers scour the scene of the shooting . It was loaded and the safety catch was off. Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, the other occupants of the VW Golf, were arrested and later admitted possession of firearms. Explaining the background of the case, Mr Underwood said that in early April 2005 Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise, as it was known then, received intelligence about an armed gang that robbed drug dealers. Its modus operandi would be to set up a meeting to view Class A drugs and then steal them at gunpoint. HMCE believed that one of the men in the gang was called ‘Azelle’ and had the same day and month of birth as Rodney. Speaking . before the hearing, Rodney’s mother, Susan Alexander said: ‘My main . concern is to see a robust, effective and transparent inquiry. Everyone . needs to know what happened why my son died that day.’ The inquiry, which is expected to last ten weeks, continues.. Evidence: Investigators take the car Mr Rodney was a passenger in away for examination .","Azelle Rodney, 24, killed instantly during police 'hard stop' in April 2004 .

"She's a global style icon with immense selling power so it's hardly surprising that women try and emulate the Duchess of Cambridge in the sartorial stakes. But it seems someone a little closer to home has been taking some inspiration from the pregnant royal. For most people, dressing like your mother is usually best avoided but clearly Kate and Carole aren't bothered because the mother-daughter-duo stepped out in strikingly similar gowns at last night's Royal Variety Performance. Scroll down for video . Similar style: The Duchess of Cambridge, left, and her mother Carole Middleton often dress similarly and last night's Royal Variety Performance was no exception. The mother-daughter duo looked glamorous in lace black dresses . Glowing in a stunning floor length Diane von Furstenberg lace gown, Kate - who is 16 weeks pregnant - dazzled as she and William arrived at the London Palladium. Carole, 59, meanwhile, seemingly opted for a shorter version of her daughter's dress, which she teamed with strappy heels - a style often championed by Kate. Both dresses were finished with lace - a strong story on the catwalks this season - and both women completed their outfits with dazzling jewels. This isn't the first time that the pair have dressed similarly. The Duchess of Cambridge doesn’t just share her mother's sense of style, she apparently shares her clothes, too. On trend: The pair looked stylish in black lace dresses. Kate wore her hair in a low chignon while Carole went for a half-up-half-down style at the event . Family matters: Carole, 59, was joined by her husband Michael and teamed her lace dress with strappy heels - a style often championed by Kate . Glamorous: The pregnant Duchess glowed with health as she left the event armed with a bouquet of flowers last night . Suits you: Carole Middleton wears the £650 Collette Dinnigan design in 2009 (left) while her daughter the duchess donned the same frock for a friend’s wedding in September 2011 . Kate had clearly raided her mother's wardrobe when she attended a wedding in September 2011 and found a £650 Collette Dinnigan design. She added a pillbox hat and black 4in Prada heels to make the look her own. Carole Middleton had looked equally stunning when she wore the dress her own way in 2009 for the Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition. A jaunty blue Jane Corbett fascinator is another winner with both mother and daughter. Kate wore it to the wedding of Nicholas van Cutsem, one of William’s closest friends, while Carole tried it on for size at Royal Ascot the same year. The pair also shared an eye-catching fur hat in 2006 - seen first on Carole when she was a surprise guest at Prince William’s passing out parade from Sandhurst in February 2006, then borrowed by Kate for a visit to the Cheltenham races the following month. When off-duty, the Duchess and her mother (as well as Pippa) opt for skinny jeans tucked into knee-high leather boots and white shirts. Feeling blue: The Duchess of Cambridge wore the same blue Reiss dress worn by her mother on the last day of Royal Ascot in 2010 as she gave her first public speech at The Tree House children's hospice in 2012 . Mum knows best: Carol and Kate both wore the same jaunty blue Jane Corbett fascinator hat in 2011 . It's always been the case! The pair also share the same off-duty style, which they showcased back in 2005 at Gatcombe . What Kate wore: Carole and Kate often wear similar outfits and opt for the same colour palette . Country style: Their out of hours uniform often consists of wellies, skinny jeans and sloane ranger jackets and tops . There's no wonder Kate has been taking style tips from her mother, who recently  pipped Camilla to the top spot when it comes to Queen of the 'Glam-Mas'. A survey revealed that 40 per cent of grandmother's vote Carole as their poster girl. The survey also revealed that 88 per cent of British grandmother’s now consider themselves to be ‘Glam-mas’, and are a serious force to be reckoned with in the style stakes. With the average age of a British grandparent now under 50, researchers have discovered that grandmothers are now choosing to step away from their traditional stereotype and as a result have become somewhat of a style inspiration for many of their younger family members. So, the only question that remains is: who stole whose style?","Kate, 32, wore striking Diane von Furstenberg lace gown .

"Cleared: Deputy head Roy Cope outside Blackburn Magistrates Court where he was cleared of assaulting an unruly primary school pupil . A dedicated teacher was subjected to a five month court ordeal after he was accused of assaulting an 'uncontrollable' pupil who had hit 10 classmates. Roy Cope had to restrain a pupil at St Bartholomew's Church of England Primary School in Great Harwood, Lancashire, who displayed the 'worst behaviour' he had seen in his 41 years in the job. The 63-year-old deputy head was accused of holding the boy by the wrists and slapping him on the side of the head after the youngster went berserk and flew into an 'incandescent rage.' This child, not named for legal reasons, had lashed out at other pupils with his satchel, pinned one to the wall by the throat and shouted at a teacher. Mr Cope was asked to intervene when the boy was ordered out of class and was spotted in a corridor shouting at another member of staff. Blackburn Magistrates Court heard that the case, which cost taxpayers thousands, and if Mr Cope was convicted could have faced up to six months jail, but to huge cheers from the public gallery he was acquitted. He claimed all along the boy slammed his head against his hand while violently swaying and rocking in a bid to run away. Chairman of the bench Graham Parr said: 'We accept that there were . aggravating facts presented to us in that the boy was behaving in an . unruly manner. We really have doubts over whether the contact . constituted an assault.' After the case was thrown out Mr Cope’s son Robin, speaking on his behalf, said: 'The family have had overwhelming support over my father’s case but it should never have come to court in the first place. 'The fact is there is an issue today with unruly children and it has come to this where dedicated teachers are repeatedly appearing before the courts on their say-so. 'It caused a lot of distress and all because of one child where there were not enough measures in place to deal with him.' A retired detective inspector and a . parent gave evidence at the hearing praising Mr Cope as a dedicated and . professional teacher of the 'highest standards.' James Oldcorn, a parent, PTA member, . governor at the school and former senior police officer, said: 'I always . found Mr Cope a very enthusiastic teacher. 'He continued the very idea of a Christian School, where every child mattered.' Claims: The alleged incident took place at Bartholomew's Church of England Primary School in Great Harwood, Lancashire, pictured . Wendy Litherland, the mother of a pupil at St Bartholomew's, said: 'Mr . Cope is an absolutely outstanding teacher, he has dedicated his life to . St Bartholomew's and all the parents are 100 per cent behind him. 'This is because of one child. There are not enough measures to deal with this.' The court heard how the incident occurred last March while Mr Cope, from Accrington, was involved in a rehearsal for a forthcoming school production of Wind In The Willows. The boy had become 'hysterical and out of control' in a class and one teacher, Thomas Lowe, said the pupil was in such a rage he grabbed railings to stop him being taken to Mr Cope’s office, continuously shouting ‘get off me, get off me’. He said he saw Mr Cope hit the child and threaten to do it again if he did not calm down. He told magistrates: 'Mr Cope was not using a technique I knew, but he seemed in charge. He was being forceful but fair. 'The child’s arms were flailing and he kept on shouting, getting more and more hysterical. Mr Cope released or lost control of the boy’s left arm and then he struck him across the face.' Mr Neil White prosecuting said: 'Mr Cope has a long and distinguished teaching career with many decades behind him. He is a well-respected and well liked deputy head at the school. 'But the prosecution say that you cannot slap a boy across the face.' Speaking in court Roy Cope responded: 'As a teacher with over 40 years’ experience this allegation has come as a great shock to me and caused me and my family great distress. 'Since the boy started school he was a disruptive and aggressive pupil and frequently disrupted the school. He is probably the worst of the pupils I have ever taught in 40 years of teaching and on occasions he is uncontrollable. 'He worked himself into an incandescent rage, I knew it was all bluster and knew he would eventually calm down. I had to be calm but firm with him.' Another teacher went to Mr Cope’s aid as the tried to restrain the boy and calm him down. But Mr Cope said: 'Because he had just been restrained he was more agitated than he had been and was trying to break free from his arms. 'I was trying to get him to stop wobbling round because he was getting more agitated and he slammed himself into my hand. He just kept rolling and rocking and trying to get rid of the restrain. All the time I was speaking in a calm quiet voice saying ‘calm down’ but once I had let go of his hands I may have said, ‘do you want me to do it again’ to stop his hands from moving. 'But I do not believe a slap across the face is a method of controlling children.' Graham Boyes, a former headteacher at the school said: “Roy has worked to the highest of standards. He was an example to other members of staff. 'I have to say, over a long period of time the school functioned well and a lot of that was down to Roy’s work in the school.' Mr Cope’s lawyer Simon Farnsworth said: 'The boy was an unruly pupil and has been since he started nursery. In Mr Cope’s experience the worst in over 40 years’ teaching. 'Mr Cope had been forceful but fair and went to assist as the boy’s arms were flaring. He is someone who deals with unruly pupils and he has dealt with these for many years. 'He is not the kind of man who would deliberately strike a young boy like this. This matter has got out of hand.'","Deputy head Roy Cope has been acquitted of assault after magistrates said he had no case to answer .

"A science question asking whether a woman named LaShamanda would pass on her 'big bootie' to her daughter has been removed from lessons after parents said it was racist. Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, featured a genetics question in which students were asked to work out the likelihood of a child - LaPrincess - getting 'her mama's big bootie'. Outraged parents question seized upon the question's language, which they said uses racial stereotypes and belittles black people, causing school authorities to withdraw it from tests. 'Racist' question: The item, above, from a genetics quiz, asked students in Charlotte, North Carolina, to work out the likelihood of LaPrincess - daughter to LaShamanda and 'her man' Fontavius - getting a 'big bootie' The question, reported by WBTV, was designed to tests whether the students could understand the difference between a dominant trait, which parents are likely to pass on, and a recessive one, which they are not. It begins: 'LaShamanda has a heterozygous big bootie, the dominant trait. Her man Fontavius has a small bootie which is recesiive. They get married and have a baby named LaPrincess.' After asking students to show their workings, two questions were asked: . The mother of an Ardrey High student said: 'This is not appropriate language at all for the children in the school'. A father whose child goes to the school said: 'It's racist - absolutely - and stereotypical.' An initial response to a parent who complained from an Ardrey High teacher apologized for the offence - but attempted to justify its inclusion by saying students could skip the question and choose another. Outrage: Parents of pupils at Ardrey High (pictured) complained when they read the question, which has been discontinued . However, after renewed complaints the school district distanced itself from the question and said it would be pulled. A statement from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), which operates Ardrey High, said: 'The worksheet does not appear to be a document created by CMS. 'The school has taken the worksheet out of circulation and requested its teachers to discontinue using it.'","Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte, North Carolina, ran the question .

"Barneys has unveiled its new holiday window display, designed by Moulin Rouge director Baz Luhrmann and his wife Catherine Martin. The ornately decorated windows, which literally stopped traffic along Madison Avenue when they were first revealed to the public last night, feature live performances, custom music, one-of-a-kind sculptures and the same flashy flourishes that both the director and his costume designer wife are famous for. The windows took more than 100 people to assemble over the course of ten months, according to Style.com. Trippy! A contortionist elf weaves through mushrooms in front a huge gold boombox in the 'love' window . Be honest! A mechanical, steampunk-inspired owl is perched inside the 'truth' display . Ice queen! The 'freedom' window will have an ice dancer named Celestina doing figure-eights . Psychedelic! The 'beauty' window has sculptures by renowned artist Anthony Howe being blown by wind machines . Each of the windows has a different theme - truth, beauty, love or freedom – which were inspired by the artistic ideals that Baz brought to life in his popular musical movie Moulin Rouge. The 'truth' display has a steampunk-inspired mechanical owl residing in a nest made of large branches. It speaks the lyrics to 'Holiday' by Madonna. In the 'love' window, a contortionist elf character dances  between huge psychedelic mushrooms and a golden boombox. The performance will take place Wednesdays through Saturdays. Through the 'beauty' glass are abstract sculptures by Anthony Howe, around which snowflakes will fall, blown by a wind machine. And, perhaps most astonishingly, the 'freedom' window has an ice dancer, who the creators are calling Celestina, performing figure-eights. All of the windows will have custom music by Pentatonix, the five-person a capella group that won NBC's The Sing-Off in 2011. The store also constructed balconies outside the building's second story, where a 'Luna Queen' and 'Ice Queen' will sing on weekends. The geniuses behind the madness! Husband and wife Baz Luhrmann (left) and Catherine Martin (right) - known for their films like Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge - attend the window reveal party on Thursday night . So cold! The Ice Queen performs in a gown designed by Catherine Martin and Zaldy . She only comes out at night! The 'Luna Queen' performs in another gown by Ms Martin and Zaldy, who's designed clothing for Michael Jackson, Britney Spears and Lady Gaga, among others . This marks the first time the retailer has ever had live performances in its holiday windows. It also marks the first time Mr Luhrmann and Ms Martin have worked on a retailer's holiday campaign, according to the Wall Street Journal. The pair, who are known for movies like Great Gatsby, Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet, insist they've been deeply involved in the project, doing a lot more than just lending their names. 'We’re not just doing the royal wave and saying ""that was fantastic,""' Mr. Luhrmann said. Ms Martin added: 'Have I been spraying things gold and hot-gluing stones on a helmet at 5 am this morning? Yes.' The costumes - which alone are worth going to see - were a collaboration between Ms Martin and Zaldy, who's previously dressed Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, and members of Cirque du Soleil. A vision in black! Actress Dakota Fanning attended the big reveal on Thursday night . The decor is part of a larger company-wide campaign, called Baz Dazzled, that will include events throughout the month and limited-edition products - like tabletop accessories, ornaments, children's costumes and toys - that will be for sale in the store. The retailer is donating 25per cent of proceeds from all Baz Dazzled products to Room to Read, a global organization that focuses on literacy and gender equality for children in developing countries. Ms Martin and Mr Luhrmann fashioned their creations around their personal motto: 'A life lived in fear is a life half-lived.'

"A sect leader who raped women in a convent he set up - telling them sex would heal them spiritually - is on the run from Czech officials . Officers have issued an international arrest warrant for self-titled spiritual guru Jaroslav Dobes, 43, who reportedly had sex with more than 350 devotees between setting up his convent in the city of Zlin in Czech Republic's Moravia in 2002 and going on the run in 2007. He even charged the women thousands of pounds for the service, many of whom were pressured into going through the ordeal with him and paying the money, a court heard. He was found guilty this week at a trial in his absence and sentenced to 10 years for the sex attacks, although the court heard he is now living in Asia where he had set up a new sect and was still offering sex for sale to his disciples. Predator: Sect leader Jaroslav Dobes set up a convent for women, who he then raped. Czech officials have put out an international arrest warrant for the 43-year-old. Police also want his assistant Barbora Plaskova . Jaroslav Dobes known as 'Guru Jara', 'Om' or as the 'Uber Alpha Male' was charged with raping at least eight women at the convent between 2004 and 2007. Also sentenced was his assistant Barbora Plaskova, 40, who helped him with all his activities and was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. Dobes and Plsakova were represented in court by their lawyers because the couple are in Thailand. Dobes told his followers that he could help them with everything from their spirituality, tarot, yoga and feng-shui since he started out as a self-proclaimed guru in 1996. The school and convent, known as Poetrie, that he established in 2002 was only for women. He also took seminars and organised conferences across the Czech Republic teaching yoga, astrology, feng shui and tantra. But it was the  technique called 'unhooking' that saw the group finally exposed as a conman. His victims said he had told them that 'when a man and woman sleep together they join up their energies so that they never split again. A man can suck energy from a woman through that hook, it makes the woman tired. 'But if a man has more hooks he has more energy and he is in better position to give the woman energy and help.' One of Dobes's clients – a woman who had been 18 when she met him – described her horrific experience in a short video statement to the court. Jaroslav Dobes known as 'Guru Jara', 'Om' or as the 'Uber Alpha Male' was charged with raping at least eight women at the convent between 2004 and 2007 . The young woman, who  kept her face covered, said that she had gone to him after problems in a relationship and that Dobes's assistant Barbora Plaskova had advised her to try the 'unhooking'. She said: 'I was apprehensive about going through with it but I decided to try it.' The court heard that Plaskova took the victim to a tiny apartment in Prague, told her to undress and to lie naked on the bed. She said Plaskova then did some breathing exercises with her to get her ready for the unhooking. Marie said: 'Jara came, encircled me with crystals then entered me with force. It was extremely painful and had nothing to do with tantra. 'It was hurting me, I was terrified. But I was so brainwashed that I even then still believed that this was in some way good for me.' She said that the ordeal with the frequent sessions went on for six months and it was only at the end of it when she felt worse than ever that she realised she had been conned. Dobes's unusual methods of removing the negative energy finally resulted in a police investigation in 2007 on a number of victims came forward, and in the same year he vanished abroad. He was joined by his assistant two years later when police widened the investigation to include her as well. Other victims also spoke of the horrific ordeal at the hands of the guru and sect leader. One said: 'I had to get undressed, I was made to do stomach breathing exercise that left me weakened and unable to defend myself. I wasn't able to control my body. There were candles and music playing and incense that left me confused.' She and others also said that as well as being made to have sex with the guru, they had also been interfered with by his assistant who said that she was stimulating them to prepare them for the spiritual experience. Prosecutor Yvetta Eichlerova said Dobes had sexual intercourse with as many as 350 of his female clients. Some of them did it willingly, she admitted, but added that many others had been pressured and lied to and then put in a position where they were unable to defend themselves. According to accusation he raped at least eight women between 2004 and 2007 but the real number was probably far higher. Psychologist Alena Gayova who treated many of his victims told the court that they were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that in many cases this was chronic and had resulted in life-long consequences. Typical symptoms were relationship problems, depression and low self-esteem. Guru Jara's defence lawyer Libor Knott urged the court to throw out the charges saying that all of the women had gone into the sex act with the sect leader willingly. He said: 'The women knew what would happen so it was not a crime.' However judge Iveta Sperclichova decided that Dobes and Plaskova chose their clients carefully by targeting vulnerable young women. Handing out the sentence she said: 'They only chose attractive young women who could also be useful to them financially and as sex objects. It is clear that the main idea of their school was not helping people.' Dobes, who also claims to be a photographer, writer, traveller and mountain climber is offering books and photographs on his website, as well as personal consultations. A three-day session with Guru Jara costs 108,000 Czech Koruna (£3,085).","Jaroslav Dobes, 43, told the women sex would heal them spiritually .

"Arrest: June  when she was arrested for contempt after falling behind in child support . June 'Mama June' Shannon failed to pay more than $4,000 in child support to her own mother when she became the legal guardian of Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell  after the little girl was molested. Sandra Hale became Anna's guardian  in 2003, a year after the child was allegedly sexually abused by her mother's then-boyfriend Mark McDaniel. According to TMZ, Mama June, now 35, was required to pay Hale $100 a month in child support, but she quickly fell far behind on the payments. In 2009, she was arrested and the Henry County District Attorney filed criminal contempt charges, claiming she had fallen $4,144.62 behind on the child support. June was behind 'due to willful and continuous refusal to comply', legal documents obtained by TMZ stated, and the mother-of-four was threatened with jail time. But three months after it was filed, the contempt charge was dismissed. McDaniel, 53, was released from prison earlier this year after serving 10 years for aggravated child molestation of an eight-year-old in 2004, who Anna says is actually her. Despite damning photographs that show them house hunting together and him hanging out with her daughter Honey Boo Boo, Mama June previously denied claims that she has been seeing McDaniel. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight that aired this week, June said she had only seen McDaniel twice since he was released from prison and denied they were in a relationship. June said one meeting she had with McDaniel was coincidental, and the other was to give closure to her daughter Pumpkin, who had been raised believing McDaniel was her father. She said 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel. Mama June's 20-year-old daughter Anna Cardwell revealed she was molested when she was eight . Owed: Mama June's mother, Sandra Hale, pictured, said she wanted to kill McDaniel when she learned about what he had done to her granddaughter. She became the girl's legal guardian . After the images emerged, TLC canceled Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has run for four seasons. At aged nine, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' is a year older than her sister Anna was when she says she was abused by McDaniel. Anna claimed he sexually abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, then three, was forced to watch. Mark McDaniel, 53, was released from prison in October after serving 10 years for aggravated child molestation of an eight-year-old in 200 . Mama June's mother, who was owed the child support, spoke to Entertainment Tonight last month about the abuse her granddaughter suffered. 'My reaction was I wanted to kill him,' Hale said of McDaniel. 'To do that to a child - especially her... I took her to the police department and filed the charges. I wasn't going to let this go away.' She said that she thinks her daughter is 'in denial' about what McDaniel did and that she is now concerned for the safety of Honey Boo Boo, who is nine. 'That's about the same age he likes,' she said. Hale said that when child protective services called her recently, she urged them to look 'carefully and closely' into the allegations that McDaniel has been hanging around Mama June's children. After Anna told her teacher and police about the assaults, her mother refused to believe her, she said. 'Mama didn't believe me for a while,' she told HLN. 'She would say, ''Why would you do that to me?' And I would say, 'Mama, he did it, I can't take the past back'. 'He's apologized for what he's done but she won't... I'm hurt now and I was hurt then.' But Anna added that she is still in touch with her mother and that they are 'working on things'. Pumpkin, now 14, has repeatedly defended her mother in interviews and on social media. The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September. 'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer. Mama June is pictured with (clockwise from left) eldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee', 20, ex-husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, and daughters Lauryn 'Pumpkin', 14, Jessica 'Chubbs', 18, and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.' Mama June's three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying Michael Cardwell. June has maintained her four daughters are from four different men. The claim means convicted child molester Mark Anthony Ford Ford is father two of the girls, middle daughters Jessica and Lauryn 'Pumpkin'. Eldest Anna's father is David Dunn, who was sentenced for stealing a handgun in 1995 and again in 1998 for stealing cigarettes. The father of the youngest, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo', is Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, who split from wife Mama June earlier this year.

"The Duchess of Cambridge may have access to a collection of dazzling jewels that date back hundreds of years but the royal prefers to stay true to the designers she's championed for years. Last night was case in point as she stepped out at the Royal Variety performance in a dazzling pair of Lola Blue Topaz Hoops by Kiki McDonough. The £3,200 earrings comes in 18ct white gold and promise to add a splash of colour to any outfit. Dazzling: The Duchess of Cambridge accessorised her black Diane von Furstenberg gown with £3,200 Lola Blue Topaz Hoops by Kiki McDonough . Kate is a loyal fan of the brand and has been spotted at various royal outings wearing the bold designs by the Chelsea-based designer. Speaking about Kate, Kiki, who's been designing pieces of jewellery for around for 25 years, told MailOnline: 'She wears my pieces as they should be worn. She obviously enjoys wearing colour on her ears as opposed to pearls and diamonds all the time.' Kiki thinks the earrings complemented the black Diane Von Furstenberg dress 'beautifully' last night by adding some colour. Staying true to her thrifty reputation, Kate  has previously worn them with a pale blue coat dress to the Olympic Opening Ceremony reception and on another occasion with a lavender cocktail dress. 'My jewellery is very wearable so it is easy for her to put it with jeans, skirts and dresses - so it is suitable for every occasion,' added Kiki. Loved her look: Kiki thinks the earrings complemented the black Diane Von Furstenberg dress 'beautifully' last night, adding colour, which Kiki's designs are famed for . Similar style: Kiki thinks Kate is an ideal customer, saying she is a busy working mother like her . Intriguingly, Kiki's designs were once worn by William’s mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales, as well as the likes of actresses Rosamund Pike and Emilia Fox. Kiki thinks Kate is an ideal customer. She said: 'She is a busy working mother like me, and I design jewellery that goes with that lifestyle. My designs have always reflected the way we live now, dashing from work to an event. 'I will quite often keep the same pair of earrings on for a week and they go with me wherever I am going (from the theatre to a football match) and that seems to be something that my clients appreciate.' Kiki's collection aims to showcase her love of vibrant colour and wearable designs and she always uses the most vibrant semi precious stones in daring colour combinations, which Kate clearly loves. 'I like to see ordinary, stylish women who appreciate fine jewellery that they can wear all the time wearing my piece. They don’t have to be celebrities,' she added. Loyal fan: Kate wore the exact same earrings to the Olympic Opening Ceremony reception, left, and Kiki's colourful jewels to present Lord Sebastian Coe with the Lifetime Achievement Award during the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards, right . Undoubtedly the best-known item in Kate's jewellery collection is her £28,500 engagement ring, which once belonged to Princess Diana. The blue sapphire, which sparkles with 14 diamonds, was bought at the former Crown jewellers Garrard of Mayfair for a staggering £28,500. When it comes to choosing her own accessories, Kate does, however, prefer more simple pieces like her £1,090 Annoushka Pearl Drop earrings and more modest £275 Links Hope earrings. She's even a fan of cheap but chic jewellery, which she snapped up from Made In Chelsea star Amber Atherton's myflashtrash website and wore while on her Diamond Jubilee tour of the South Pacific. Kate hand-picked seven different pieces, including earrings, bracelets, and necklaces, from the company that is run by the E4 reality TV star. Founder Amber told MailOnline: 'We are over the moon that Kate has been supporting British business by wearing trinkets from myflashtrash.com.' In 2012, Kate wore a delicate pair of imitation diamond-and-pearl earrings to the Diamond Jubilee service at St Paul’s Cathedral. The £48 fake pearl and cubic zirconia earrings were part of a range of jewellery sold on her website Heavenly Necklaces - an online business selling convincing, understated fake jewels.","Kiki McDonough is one of Kate's favourite designers .

"A woman who suffered six miscarriages in 14 years has spoken of her joy of finally becoming a mother. Kim Cruickshanks, 32, gave birth to Daisy four months early and was warned the baby would not survive. After the agony of losing six unborn children she could not bear to look at her first-born child when she arrived at just 23 weeks, weighing 1lb 1oz . Kim Cruickshanks, 32, gave birth to Daisy four months early and was warned the baby would not survive. She had already suffered six miscarriages in 14 years . But to her delight, her husband Anthony Slaughter, 32, turned her round and told her: ‘Look, she’s moving.’ The couple faced further trauma as Daisy battled for survival at Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent. The couple were not allowed to hold her for the first 18 days - and she spent three months in intensive care. She was finally allowed home on August 1 after reaching 4lb 8oz. Mrs Cruickshanks said: ‘It feels like it’s a miracle - I can’t believe I waited so long have a baby. I didn’t think it was going to happen. ‘I still keep checking on her. I’m forever looking over at her. Mrs Cruickshanks, and her husband Anthony Slaughter, were not allowed to hold Daisy for the first 18 days after her birth and she spent three months in intensive care . ‘She’s lifting her head and doing things you would expect of a four-month-old baby and she smiles a bit. ‘We were told it was highly unlikely she would make it. ‘They said when she was born she might breathe a little bit but that might be it. ‘I thought we were going to lose her - we had a bit of hope but were prepared for the worst.’ When Daisy was born 16 weeks early she weighed just 1lb 1oz and had numerous problems including low blood pressure, respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure and jaundice . Mrs Cruickshanks, from Sheerness, Kent, was always at risk of miscarrying because she has polycystic ovaries and her six previous pregnancies all ended before 12 weeks. Her hopes were raised when she passed the three month landmark with Daisy and she rushed out to buy baby clothes. But her joy turned to terror when she went into labour at 23 weeks, 16 weeks before her due date - and still a week before the official abortion limit. Daisy (pictured with her cousin, Lily) was finally allowed home on August 1 after reaching 4lb 8oz. Her development is expected to catch up with that of other children by the time she is five . She admitted to Medway Maritime Hospital on 17 April and went into labour on the morning of 20 April. She gave birth to Daisy who was in the breech position later that day. Daisy was rushed away and her parents were warned her chances of survival were slim. Doctors managed to get her breathing through a tube but the premature baby had numerous problems including low blood pressure, respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, jaundice, feeding problems, hyperglycaemia and metabolic bone disease. Daisy (pictured with her mother, Kim, her grandmother, Bev, and her cousin, Lily) will have to have regular check ups until she is two-years-old to ensure that she is developing normally . Mrs Cruickshanks was discharged four days after giving birth and went back to visit Daisy every day before she was finally allowed to take her home. Daisy will need to be monitored closely until she is two-years-old, but her parents have been told she is expected to have caught up with other children by the age of five. Mrs Cruickshanks has since discovered that her great-great-grandmother, Dolly Boakes, weighed exactly the same as Daisy when she was born in 1910. She had to be wrapped in cotton wool for the first six months of her life - but lived into her 80s.","Kim Cruickshanks had six miscarriages before the 12th week of pregnancy .

"If you enjoy snacks and drinks like Mtn Dew, Chex Mix, Hungry Man frozen dinners, or roughly 80 percent of all the packaged foods sold in your average, American grocery store, you may want to sit down before reading this. Many of the chemicals found in America's most common foods are considered to be so unhealthy that they're actually ILLEGAL in other countries. A new book on nutrition first highlighted by BuzzFeed lists six food additives that are found in a wide range of popular groceries sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration, but foreign governments have determined to be too dangerous to allow their citizens to consume. Extreme! Mt. Dew is made with a chemical that also is used to prevent carpets from catching on fire . Bubble gag: Bubble Yum contains a chemical that is known to cause cancer in rats . 'Rich Food, Poor Food' by Doctor Jayson Calton and Mira Calton, a certified nutritionist, features a list of what the authors call 'Banned Bad Boys' - a list of the ingredients, where they're banned and what caused governments to ban them. One of the most common 'Bad Boys' is different variations of food coloring, which actually is made from petroleum and is found in everyday items like soda, sports drinks, mac and cheese, cake, candy and several other common, American products. The chemicals used to make these different dyes have proven to cause various different cancers and can even potentially mutate healthy DNA. Olestra is a fat substitute. It also causes a dramatic depletion of fat-soluble vitamins and carotenoids . Petroleum Loops: fruit loops are delicious - and made from a product that's made out of the same stuff that makes gasoline . European countries like Norway, Finland, France and Austria all have banned at least one variation of petroleum-containing food coloring. Another common additive banned in other countries but allowed in the U.S. is Olestra, which essentially is a fat substitute found in products that traditionally have actual fat. For example, low-fat potato chips like Ruffles Lite, Lays Wow and Pringles fat-free chips all contain Olestra - which is shown to cause the depletion of fat-soluble vitamins. Different brands of fat-free ice cream and mayonnaise at one time also contain the chemical. Olestra has been banned in several countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada. In 2003, the FDA lifted a requirement forcing companies that use Olestra in their products to include a label warning consumers that the food their eating could cause 'cramps and diarrhea,' despite the fact that the agency received more than 20,000 reports of gastrointestinal complaints among olestra eaters. Do you like citrus drinks, like Mt. Dew, Squirt or Fresca? Then you also like brominated vegetable oil, which is banned in more than 100 countries because it has been linked to basically every form of thyroid disease - from cancer to autoimmune diseases - known to man. In Singapore you can get up to fifteen years in prison and penalized nearly half a million dollars in fines for using an ingredient found in common U.S. bread products . Hungry? 1 1/2 pounds of food (and chemicals used to make bleach and rubber yoga mats) Other products made from bromine: chemicals used to keep carpets from catching on fire and for disinfecting swimming pools. Other food products made from brominated vegetable oil include New York brand flatbreads, bagel chips, Baja Burrito wraps and other bread products. Of brominated vegetable oil, the FDA says it is approved 'for flavoring oils used in fruit-flavored beverages, for which any applicable standards of identity do not preclude such use, in an amount not to exceed 15 parts per million in the finished beverage.' Then there's things like Hungry Man frozen dinners, which will fill you up - with azodicarbonamide, a chemical used make things like bleach and rubber yoga mats. Most frozen potato and bread products - like different varieties of McCain brand french fries - contain the chemical, as well as several store brand bread products. Azodicarbonamide is known to induce asthma, and has been banned in Australia, the U.K. and most other European countries. If you were to use it as a food ingredient in Singapore, you could face up to 15 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. According to the FDA, Azodicarbonamide is 'approved to be a bleaching agent in cereal flour' and is 'permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption.'

"A husband has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole Friday for poisoning his wife to death with nicotine two decades ago and then collecting on her life insurance policy. Paul Marshal Curry, 58, of Salina, Kansas, showed no emotion as he was sentenced by Orange County Superior Court Judge Patrick Donahue for the 1994 death of his wife, Linda Curry. Curry called 911 on June 9, 1994, and told authorities he had found his wife of two years in bed and not breathing. Sentenced: Paul Marshal Curry, 58, of Salina, Kansas, showed no emotion as he was given life in prison by Orange County Superior Court Judge Patrick Donahue for the 1994 death of his wife, Linda Curry . Curry killed his wife (pictured) and began collecting $547,000 of her life insurance the day after her funeral. Police say they believe Curry murdered her at the time, but they didn't have enough evidence to press charges . The day after her funeral, he began trying to collect her life insurance benefits and ultimately received $547,000, according to prosecutors. During trial, prosecutor Ebrahim Baytieh told jurors that the former nuclear power plant engineer slowly poisoned his 50-year-old wife over the course of a year before he slipped her a powerful sedative and injected her with a fatal dose of nicotine. At the time, police believed he had murdered Linda Curry but didn't have enough evidence to press charges. Curry moved to Kansas and the case went cold until 2007, when investigators discovered new evidence that shortened the window of time that Curry had to give the fatal nicotine injection. He was arrested in 2010 in Kansas. In 1993, a year before Linda Curry's death, the couple were questioned when hospital staff discovered a dose of lidocaine in Linda Curry's IV bag while she was being hospitalized for unexplained vomiting, headaches and bloody diarrhea. To the cells: During the trial the court heard that Curry (pictured being led out of court) slowly poisoned his wife over a year before giving her a fatal nicotine dose . Curry, who had a new wife and a new job when he was arrested in 2010, was found guilty of the killings in September. At the time of his wife's death he said he would have had nothing to gain from it . At the time, Paul Curry said he had nothing to gain from his wife's death. During the trial, Curry's former wife testified that in the last year of their marriage she was constantly ill and Curry suggested she apply for life insurance. When her application was rejected, he divorced her and she instantly began to feel better, according to testimony. Curry's attorney, Lisa Kopelman, argued that Linda Curry was a sickly person with digestive ailments and that she could have been taking nicotine as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. During testimony his second wife (not pictured) said she was constantly ill during the marriage and Curry had asked her to apply for life insurance .","Paul Marshal Curry, 58, of Salina, Kansas killed his wife Linda in 1994 .

"His hand was so tiny that he could barely hold his mother’s little finger. Yet somehow premature baby Lucas Georgiou, pictured here at one week old in intensive care, clung to life. He had been born at 23 weeks and weighed just 1lb 8oz. Doctors gave him only a one in four chance of survival. Lucas Georgiou, pictured here with mother Tracy, weighed just 1lb 8oz when he was born at 23 weeks on April 29 . Yesterday, however, four months after his birth and four days before his due date, his parents Tracy and Costa Georgiou were allowed to take him home for the first time. ‘The doctors say Lucas is a real-life miracle,’ said Mrs Georgiou. ‘We have watched him grow in his incubator, when it should have been happening in my womb. Now I’m ecstatic to be taking him home. Winning the lottery couldn’t top how we feel now.’ Their ordeal began on April 29 when Mrs Georgiou, 31, a carer who has two older children, began bleeding heavily while at her cousin’s. She feared history was repeating itself – eight months earlier she had lost a daughter, whom they named Sophia, at 18 weeks because of a rare condition in which the placenta becomes detached from the womb, causing a life-threatening haemorrhage. Mrs Georgiou, of Liverpool, was taken to the city’s Women’s Hospital where doctors said they needed to deliver her new baby immediately. ‘I went into shock,’ she said. ‘My cousin saved mine and Lucas’s life by acting quickly to call an ambulance and talking to staff on the phone about how to stem the bleeding while I was drifting in and out of consciousness.’ Doctors had given him just a one in four chance of survval. Yet somehow premature Lucas , pictured here at one week old in intensive care, clung to life . Lucas was delivered by caesarean section, only a week before the legal limit for abortion. Mrs Georgiou lost the equivalent of all the blood in her body and needed repeated transfusions to save her life . Lucas was delivered by caesarean section, only a week before the legal limit for abortion. Mrs Georgiou lost the equivalent of all the blood in her body and needed repeated transfusions to save her life. She spent 24 hours in intensive care with her husband, a 36-year-old chef, by her bedside. He had no idea if his wife or son would survive. After three days, she came round to learn her son had been born and was able to go and see him in his incubator. Now, four months after his birth and four days before his due date, his parents Tracy and Costa Georgiou were allowed to take him home for the first time . At six weeks he had an operation to mend an open valve in his heart, then last month he had an eye operation to prevent him going blind. Mrs Georgiou said they knew he might not survive the heart operation, adding: ‘But he did and it was a turning point. Every hour, every minute, every second counted.’ Lucas is now a healthy 5lb 3oz and Mrs Georgiou said that after months of looking at him in his incubator, she could not wait to see him in his own cot for the first time.","Lucas Georgiou weighed just 1lb 8oz when he was born on April 29 .

"Always fancied building a boat, but don’t have the carpentry skills? Now you can print one. That’s exactly what Chinese engineers did in an effort to highlight the potential applications of what they claim to be the world’s biggest 3D printer. The fully-functioning vessel can seat two adults and was created by Industrial Innovation Design Centre in Sanya in China's Hainan Island. The fully-functioning vessel can seat two adults and was created by Industrial Innovation Design Centre in Sanya in China's Hainan Island . They have created a huge 3D printer that has the ability to print in multiple materials and in full colour, according to project leader Chen Minqiao. The printer weighs 30,000lbs (15 tons) and can create objects up to 13.2ft (4 metres) in length with a height and breadth of around 6.6ft (2 metres). It can print around 4.7 inches (12 cm) in height per hour for hollow objects with a diameter of a little less than a metre. The printer weighs 30,000lbs (15 tons) and can create objects up to four metres in length with a height and breadth of around two metres . The plastic 3D boat shown in action is one of the first objects to be turned out by the huge 3D printer in China . In April, Chinese engineers were able to build 10 detached houses within 24 hours, using the modern technology. The compact houses were constructed using waste material which was pumped out into layers. And the properties were said to have been created for less than $5,000 (£2,974) each. Four huge printers measuring 105ft (32 metres) long, 33ft (10 metres) wide and 22ft (6.6 metres) tall were used to make the bungalows. The new construction technique means affordable housing could be created faster than ever before. There are even hopes skyscrapers could be erected using the same technology. China has announced the first 3D printed house project will be located in Qingdao, a major city in Shandong Province. The plastic 3D boat is one of the first objects to be turned out by the 3D printer. The group has not revealed how much it cost to make. It measures 6.6ft (two metres) in length, is 2.7ft (0.8 metres wide), and weighs approximately 77lb (35kg). 3D printing involves by building up a 3D object from a computer file using layers of material. Like a traditional inkjet printer, material, usually plastic, is laid down on a base. Further layers are simply printed on top, gradually revealing a 3D object. The technology is used in a huge range of industries from construction to aerospace. Shoes, jewellery and even dresses have been created, with designs often sold online. Many believe it could even lead to 'mini factories' for living rooms allowing consumers to print anything they want - from a bracelet to a replacement part for a broken household appliance.

"Patients are being denied minor treatments because they smoke, The Mail on Sunday has found. In one case a healthy middle-aged man was told he could not have a ten-minute operation to cut a small benign growth off the side of his  head, because of his habit. Paul Merrett thought it would be no problem to get the inch-long fatty lump, called a lipoma, removed. Patients in need of minor operations are being refused procedures by the NHS unless they promise to give up smoking (library image) It was getting caught when he put on ear defenders and hygienic headgear for his job inspecting catering equipment. As a result, the lump was becoming painful. But when he attended King George Surgery in Stevenage, his GP said  he could not have the minor operation – which doctors often do under local anaesthetic in their own consulting rooms. Should NHS patients have to promise to quit smoking before being treated by GPs? Should NHS patients have to promise to quit smoking before being treated by GPs? Now share your opinion . Mr Merrett, 46, said: ‘I was told, in no uncertain terms, that unless I gave up smoking or signed up to a quitting clinic they would refuse to treat me.  I was gobsmacked.’ He claims the doctor told him: ‘These directions are not mine. It’s not me refusing this treatment,  it’s the NHS trust.’ Mr Merrett, who smokes ten roll-ups a day, said: ‘It makes me livid. I can count how many times I have needed to rely on the NHS in the past ten years on one hand. I pay into the system and it’s my right to be able to use it when I need it.’ An increasing number of local health authorities are refusing smokers hip and knee replacements, unless they go on courses to quit smoking. Paul Merrett who was refused minor surgery to remove a growth, pictured, from his head because he is a smoker . And obese people are also being  told they must lose weight before costly joint replacement surgery, to increase the chances of success. In some areas, such as Devon and Cornwall, smokers can no longer get IVF on the NHS unless they stop. But this is the first time it has emerged that smokers are being turned down for minor treatments, where there is less evidence that smoking affects the outcome. Simon Clark, of the pro-smoking campaign group Forest, said smokers were being targeted to cut costs. He added: ‘Smokers pay a huge amount of money to the state through taxation – more than £10 billion a  year. That far outweighs the cost of treating smoking-related diseases, and even of treating cases such as this, which have nothing whatsoever to do with smoking. ‘The NHS should treat people equally, regardless of whether they smoke. If not, they run the risk of expensive court cases.’ Yesterday, East and North Hertfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group appeared to climb down over Mr Merrett’s case. Chief executive Lesley Watts claimed he had not been refused surgery. She said the risks of smoking and surgery would be explained to him ‘so informed consent can be obtained’ – but that he would still receive the procedure if it was safe to do so, even if he carried on smoking. But Mr Merrett said: ‘That wasn’t what the doctor said to me. They’ve back-pedalled big-time.’","Paul Merrett, 46, needed to have a growth from the side of his removed .

"An Alabama woman accused of running her granddaughter to death has asked an appeals court to dismiss a capital murder charge against her, citing potential autopsy problems and legal delays. Lawyers for Joyce Garrard Hardin, 49, have filed papers with the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals saying they found numerous problems with the state's autopsy of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin in 2012. Hardin has been jailed since Feb, 22, 2012, accused of making her granddaughter run for hours as punishment for a lie about candy. Authorities have said the girl was exhausted to the point of collapsing. She died three days later in a hospital. Drop charge?: Lawyers for Joyce Garrard Hardin, 49, say  they found numerous problems with the state's autopsy of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin in 2012 and want her murder charge dropped . The defense contends the child died because of long-standing health problems, adding testimony about the girl's physical condition and the autopsy could be vital at trial. Those lawyers have asked the appeals court to order a circuit judge in Alabama's Etowah County, William Ogletree, to throw out the charge. Hardin has pleaded not guilty but faces a possible death penalty if convicted. Her trial is set to begin Feb. 12 in Gadsden; two previous trial dates were pushed back. Prosecutors have yet to respond to the defense document, which was filed Oct. 28 in Montgomery. The document was released by the appeals court Thursday at the request of The Associated Press. The state has until later this month to file an answer with the appellate panel and is under a gag order barring out-of-court comments. A petition filed by the defense contends the girl's autopsy was performed by a doctor who was later fired over allegations that included possible falsification of documents and dereliction of duty. The physician has since failed to testify in other cases and may not be available to testify in Hardin's trial, the defense argued in the document. Hardin's trial has been delayed twice despite defense attempts to move the case along, the attorneys argued. They said in their document that the postponements violate the woman's constitutional right to a speedy trial. Also, the defense claimed, Hardin is suffering from numerous health problems in the Etowah County jail and should be freed. Ogletree has previously refused to dismiss charges against Hardin. The child's stepmother is free on bond after being charged with murder for allegedly failing to intervene while the girl was running outside Hardin's rural home.

"The trend for imitating the sexy selfies taken by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian is putting children at risk of abuse, experts have warned. Miss Kardashian's habit of posting explicit sexual images of herself on the internet is said to be encouraging young girls to do the same and making them vulnerable to online predators. The reality TV star found herself singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate yesterday, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body with her 25million Twitter followers on a daily basis. Kim Kardashian's habit of posting explicit sexual images of herself on the internet is said to be encouraging young girls to do the same . This week she generated headlines around the world by posing naked for a magazine shoot, with the pictures circulating freely on the internet. Nazir Afzal – the chief prosecutor for the North West of England who helped bring the Rochdale grooming gang to justice in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls – said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators. His comments were echoed by Government adviser Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers' Union, who was also at the event held at the London School of Economics. Mr Bailey said the prevalence for sexting and sending sexual imagery among teenagers had become normalised, and raised his concerns that many 'indecent child images are actually self-generated'. The reality TV star was singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate yesterday, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body . The chief prosecutor for the North West of England said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators . Talking about the girls who become influenced by celebrities, Mr Afzal said: 'The sexualisation of children does not help. The reality is that younger and younger children these days are now exposed to the kinds of things, I saw Kim Kardashian a couple of days ago [the magazine images]. 'It's those kinds of things, role models out there saying this is the way to live your lives. But unfortunately, [predatory] men want that to happen, want them to believe that's the way to be, that men can interfere with them and damage them in some way.' Mr Bailey added: 'The idea of what was regarded as pornography, and what you see being very much available now, is very, very different. And it does worry me too, about sexting and sexualised imagery in text messaging, roughly a third of the images that [police] are picking up in terms of indecent child images are actually self-generated, and that's really worrying.'

"Mourners at a funeral in Zimbabwe were stunned when the dead man woke up as they filed by his coffin, state media reported today. Brighton Dama Zanthe, 34, was being laid to rest inside a coffin last Monday after he apparently died at his home following a long illness. The transport worker's grieving family covered his body with blankets and made arrangements to transfer him to a local mortuary, according to a report in the Herald newspaper. But the next day Mr Zanthe's friends and relatives scattered in disbelief when he started moving as they filed past to say their emotional goodbyes. 'Resurrected': The 'deceased' was being laid to rest in a coffin after apparently dying from a long illness when he woke up in the middle of his own funeral (stock image) The dead man's boss Lot Gaka told the Herald of the moment he realised his employee was still alive. He said: 'I was the first to notice Zanthe's moving legs as I was in the queue to view his body. This shocked me. 'At . first I could not believe my eyes but later realised that there was . indeed some movements on the body as other mourners retreated in . disbelief.' Mr Gaka, . who runs a bus company in the midlands city of Gweru, told the newspaper . Mr Zanthe had been persistently unwell before his 'death' last week. He told how he visited the family's home to offer support when his employee's wife called to say he had passed away. He said: 'Zanthe had been on sick leave for some time and everyone at work was aware that he was critical. On the mend: The man from Gweru, Zimbabwe, pictured, was rushed to Gweru Provincial Hospital where he was kept on life support for two days before being allowed to go home . 'We would visit him at his home. 'I was not surprised when I received a call from Zanthe's wife on Monday night last week saying that her husband had died.' He added: 'I visited two local funeral parlours for quotations before I drove to Zanthe's house so that we could take the body to the mortuary. 'Zanthe's body had already been put in a coffin and people were preparing to conduct a body viewing procession so that his body could be taken to a mortuary. 'It was during the body viewing procession that he ""resurrected"".' Another witness told the state-controlled newspaper how the family desperately pulled blankets off Mr Zanthe's body to try to revive him after realising he was still alive. He said: 'Gaka later removed some blankets from Zanthe's body after we noticed some movements and this was when we all realised that there was still life. 'We then called an ambulance which came within seven minutes. 'It's really a miracle and most people are still in disbelief.' The Herald, which is owned by Zimbabwe's government, reported that Mr Zanthe spent two days on life support after being rushed to the Gweru Provincial Hospital following the incident. He was discharged last week and has since returned home. The shaken family man told the newspaper he had only a hazy recollection of the event. He said: 'This issue can be best told by people who came to my house to attend my funeral. 'I don't know what happened and I only remember being on a life support system in hospital.' He added: 'Everything is history to me. 'What I can only confirm is that people gathered at my house to mourn but I was given another chance and I am alive.

"Victory: Jeremy Bamber was one of three killers to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against their whole life terms . Victims’ families reacted with fury last night after European judges ruled serial killers must be given the right to seek parole. In a hugely provocative decision, Strasbourg said murderers and rapists condemned to die behind bars must now be given a chance of freedom. The families said the idea of the killers walking Britain’s streets again was a ‘horrendous prospect’ and ‘life must mean life’. The whole-life tariff applies to 48 men and one woman – Rose West – whose crimes courts regard as so heinous they must never be let out. But three of them – Jeremy Bamber, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore – appealed to Europe, saying their sentences ‘undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit’. Vinter and Bamber even claimed their time in jail had left them ‘depressed and in despair’. Yesterday the highest body of the European Court of Human Rights, the Grand Chamber, agreed with them. It said refusing the 49 any prospect of release amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment in a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. All the killers must now be allowed a review – with the prospect of release if they have been ‘rehabilitated’ and are deemed harmless. Victims: Jeremy Bamber was convicted of murdering his adoptive sister Sheila, left, and parents Nevill and June, right. with a rifle in 1985 . Battle: Jeremy Bamber with girlfriend Julie at the funeral of three of his family members. He was later convicted of murdering them . Tory MPs said the ruling was an . attack on democracy that exposed the court’s ‘warped moral compass’. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling spoke of ‘a terrible day for British . justice’. Ministers are . already in a stand-off with the court over its demand to lift the ban on . prisoners voting and are furious over its decisions in favour of . terrorists and criminals. Writing . in today’s Mail, Mr Grayling threatened to withdraw from the court’s . control after the next election, and accused the judges of being . ‘misguided’ and trying to act like a ‘Supreme Court of Europe’. Lisa Jones, whose father Keith Randles was Moore’s third victim, said she was ‘extremely upset’ the killer could be released. The 45-year-old mother of three, from Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, said: ‘This man took away multiple lives in a horrific and premeditated way – why should he have the rights that he denied my father and his other victims? Horrors: Rose West, left, who helped her husband Fred kill ten young women at their house in Gloucester including their daughter Heather, right . Given hope: Ian Brady The Moors Murderer and accomplice Myra Hindley were convicted of murdering three children and burying them in the 1960s . ‘For the last 16 years, our family have . derived comfort from the knowledge that Moore would never be allowed to . walk the streets again because of what he did. Now we urgently want to . know if this means he can apply for parole, which would be a horrendous prospect.’ Moore, known as the ‘Man in Black’, killed four men in less than four months in 1995, stabbing them with a combat knife for ‘fun’. Lynne Haygarth, 53, whose brother . Edward Carthy, 28, was Moore’s second victim, said: ‘He’s less than . human – why should he have rights? Did he consider Ted’s human rights . when he decapitated him and did other unspeakable, twisted things to his . body? ‘There is no way he can get parole, he must die in prison. Life should mean life, he does not deserve a second chance.’ The . court indicated the lifers should first be given a review after 25 . years inside and then every few years afterwards if their appeal fails. If ministers were to bow to the court’s demands, it would mean six lifers would instantly be entitled to demand their freedom. They include Bamber, Dennis Nilsen, who . killed 16 men in London in the late 70s and early 80s, and John Childs, . who murdered six people including one child in the mid-70s. The . court heard that a whole-life sentence had repeatedly been ruled lawful . by the British courts, including as recently as last year. In 2003, the House of Lords said there was no reason why a crime or crimes shouldn’t merit it just for ‘pure punishment’. Bleak: Volunteers search for victims of Moors Murderer Ian Brady . Lord Steyn observed that ‘there are cases where the crimes are so wicked that even if the prisoner is detained until he or she dies it will not exhaust the requirements of retribution and deterrence’. But, by a margin of 16 to one, the judges, including those from Latvia, Georgia, Liechtenstein and Montenegro, ruled in favour of the killers. They said the authorities should review such sentences to see if the inmate has made ‘progress towards rehabilitation’ and keeping them behind bars was no longer justified. The judgment cannot be appealed. Appeal: Convicted killers Peter Moore, left, and Douglas Vinter, right, said their whole life sentences 'undermined human dignity and destroyed the human spirit' Award: The killers took their case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg . Former Labour Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, criticised the ruling which he said could mean the courts could never pass a sentence of longer than 25 years – because anyone reaching that point would automatically be entitled to a parole hearing. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling described the ruling as 'a terrible day for British justice' Ministers are expected to resist implementing the ruling, but in time this could lead to compensation claims from the prisoners who are denied a review. David Cameron was said to be ‘very, very, very, very disappointed’ with the decision. Home Secretary Theresa May, a staunch critic of the court, told the Commons the public would be dismayed. Tory ex-justice minister Nick Herbert said: ‘This is one more dreadful judgement from this discredited court, after trying to give prisoners the vote and obstructing the deportation of terrorist suspects. ‘Once again they have put us in the intolerable position where our own Parliament and courts no longer have the final say on justice. The time has come to withdraw from the European Court of Human Rights and decide these matters for ourselves.’ Tory MP for Esher and Walton, Dominic Raab, said: ‘It shows the warped moral compass of the Strasbourg Court that it allows three brutal murderers to sue Britain for inhuman treatment for jailing them for life to protect the public.’ Bamber’s lawyer, Simon McKay, praised the ruling as ‘progressive and humane’.","Prisoners serving whole life terms win the right to seek parole in Strasbourg .

"Rik Mayall's children gathered today for the unveiling of a bench in their actor father's name similar to the one he sat on while starring in the hit sitcom Bottom. Bonnie, Sidney and Rosie Mayall joined fans of the BBC Two comedy near Hammersmith Bridge Road in Hammersmith, west London, where part of the show's opening credits were filmed. Mr Mayall, who died in June, co-wrote and starred in the programme among other hit comedies between 1991 and 1995. Fans gathered outside Hammersmith Broadway in west London where a bench in the actor's memory has been unveiled following a public petition which gathered 7,000 signatures . The actor's three children, Bonnie (left), Sidney (centre) and Rosie Mayall (right) joined crowds for the event . The show's opening credits saw Mr Mayall and co-star Adrian Edmonson, who played Edward 'Eddie' Elizabeth Hitlersitting, sitting on the bench, bickering and fighting as streams of people walk past. In 2010, the 56-year-old said spoke of his sadness that the bench, which sat on a traffic island at the bottom of King Street, had been replaced with a pelican crossing. Following his death in June thousands of fans signed an online petition asking for it to be reinstated, or for a similar one to be built in his memory. Today a new bench was unveiled at the junction of Queen Caroline Street and Hammersmith Bridge Road. It bears a plaque reading: 'In Memory of The Man, The Myth, The Legend. 'Dr The Rik Mayal. Pan Global Phenomenon. Equality, Opportunity, Wisdom, Freedom & Love. 'Barbara: Love Is The Answer,' in reference to his beloved wife, Barbara Robbin. Friends, fans and co-stars of the actor gathered at the site today for its official unveiling where his children watched fondly chatted with crowds. Following their father's death in June, the siblings issued a heartfelt statement on social media, paying tribute to their 'wonderful, foul-mouthed father'. An online petition gathered 7,000 signatures calling on Hammersmith and Fulham Council to rebuild a bench in Mr Mayall's memory following his sudden death in June . The bench was immortalised by Mayall and his co-star Adrian Edmonson in the BBC Two comedy (pictured) Fans Mark Adams and Lawrence Harman pose on the memorial bench in Hammersmith, west London today . The pair recreated a scene from Bottom's opening credits in which Mr Mayall, who played Richard 'Richie' Richard, and his co-star Adrian Edmonson bicker and fight on the bench . The scene was made famous in the programme's opening credits. Bottom ran on BBC Two for four years . Mr Mayall, who also starred in hit comedies The Young Ones and Blackadder, died suddenly at the age of 56 . Fans recreated scenes from the popular Nineties show (left) as Mr Myall's children, including daughter Rosie (right), watched on fondly . Posters and letters were left on railings near the site in west London where fans gathered to pay respects . A solemn supporter offers a balloon for the late actor who was described as a 'great comic' by the council . Nigel Planer, who starred alongisde Mr Myall in The Young Ones, delivered a reading, while crowds sang the programme's theme tunes. The petition, which gathered more than 7,000 signatures,urged the council: 'Rik changed the face of comedy in the UK, he had a huge impact on thousands of people throughout the UK and around the globe. 'We, the fans and friends, feel that we need a place where we can remember him and placing a memorial bench at this location is something we feel he would have loved.' Hammersmith and Fulham councillor Wesley Harcourt said the council was ""proud of Rik Mayall's links to our borough"". He said: 'Bottom was set here, with the opening credits filmed on a bench in Hammersmith Broadway. 'That bench was later moved, so it seems right to put a new bench near the spot in memory of a great comic actor.' Mayall shot to fame for his role in the hit comedy The Young Ones in which he played a pretentious, poetry-writing student (far right) Rik Mayall played cunning Conservative politician Alan B'stard in the sitcom The New Statesman (left) as well as appearing alongside close friend and co-star Adrian Edmonson in Bottom (right) In 2010, Mr Mayall was asked in a BBC interview what the worst journey he had ever made across London was. 'Hammersmith is my stomping ground I suppose. And one of the great opening credit sequences was for the telly show Bottom, where you had Richie and Eddie - me and Ade - sitting on a bench,' he said. 'If you were to come to the end of King Street where it meets the big roundabout to get to the Hammersmith Apollo, you'd find that same bench on a traffic island - until one day they took it away and put a pelican crossing in its place. 'That for me is the worst journey I ever made, discovering what had happened to that bench.' Earlier this year the actor's former co-star Adrian Edmonson said he was struggling to cope with his friend's death. Mr Mayall died of an 'acute cardiac arrest' after a morning run with his wife, Barbara, it was reported. Rik Mayall shot to fame as the obnoxious, poetry-writing anarchist Rick in The Young Ones alongside his friend Adrian Edmondson before the duo later went on to star in their sitcom Bottom. The pair – known as The Dangerous Brothers because of their propensity for hitting each other over the head – found fame after meeting at Manchester University. Considered one of Britain's comedy greats, Mayall memorably played conniving Conservative politician Alan B'stard in the sitcom The New Statesman and swashbuckling Lord Flashheart in Blackadder. He and Edmondson also created and starred 'Bottom,' a surreally violent slapstick series about two unemployed slobs . He also featured on the big screen 1991 fantasy Drop Dead Fred - which gained him a U.S. cult following - and 1999 British comedy Guest House Paradiso. In 1998 the actor had a serious accident on a motorbike the day before Good Friday, which left him with a fractured skull and bleeding In his brain. In a Daily Mail interview years later, he joked: 'As I was technically dead for five days, I beat our Lord Jesus 5-3.' Following his death this year comedy giants and friends paid tribute to the 'extraordinary' actor he was. His children issued a heartfelt statement to their father, describing him as a 'wonderful, generous, foul-mouthed and hysterical father'.","Actor Rik Mayall died suddenly in June at the age of 56 at London home .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel admitted on Friday that three U.S. nuclear missile bases in North Dakota, Wyoming and Montana were so badly managed that they had to share a wrench used to tighten warheads to the business end of Minuteman 3 missiles. 'How did they do it? They did it by federal expressing the one wrench around to each base,' Hagel told reporters Friday morning during a press conference called to introduce new system-wide reforms affecting the nation's entire intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal. 'They were creative and innovative and they made it work. But that is not the way to do it. We now have a wrench for each location. We're going to have two for each location soon.' The three facilities in question house about 450 nuclear missiles. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters on Friday that America's nuclear missile arsenal had fallen into such chaos that repair crews at three bases had to share a single wrench . Not a joke: Missile crews in three states had to FedEx a tool back and forth – but Hagel said Friday that they each have their own now . The Pentagon's recent reviews concluded that the structure of U.S. nuclear forces is so incoherent that it cannot be properly managed in its current form, and that this problem explains why top-level officials often are unaware of trouble below them. The reviews found a 'disconnect' between what nuclear force leaders say and what they deliver to lower-level troops who execute the missions in the field. Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work added that the shared hardware was 'a little toolkit to thread the bolt so that the wrenches could attach [to a warhead], and they were being FedExed around as the secretary said.' 'For me, a Marine, that's a metaphor ... for how far things had fallen.' The near-comical situation arose, Work said, 'because people stopped reporting it. They had reported it over and over and they just worked around it.' Hagel said a lack of sustained attention and investment in the force had caused America's nuclear warfare system to 'slowly back downhill.' But 'the good news, he said, 'is there's nothing here that we can't fix. The good news is that none of this has endangered America, Americans, or put our security at risk.' He added that the Defense Department will boost spending on the nuclear forces by about 10 percent a year for the next five years – an increase of nearly $10 billion – adding there is no problem on this issue the Pentagon can't fix. 'The internal and external reviews I ordered show that a consistent lack of investment and support for our nuclear forces over far too many years has left us with too little margin to cope with mounting stresses,' said Hagel, who was flanked by senior Air Force and Navy officers. 'The root cause has been a lack of sustained focus, attention, and resources, resulting in a pervasive sense that a career in the nuclear enterprise offers too few opportunities for growth and advancement.' Online reaction to Hagel's revelation was the digital equivalent of a nation shaking its collective head . Sadly, it wasn't a garden-variety wrench that the Air Force could have found at a Home Depot or a bike shop . Hagel is ordering top-to-bottom changes in how the nation's nuclear arsenal is managed, vowing to invest billions of dollars more to fix what ails a force beset by leadership lapses, security flaws and sagging morale . Hagel ordered two reviews in February – one by Pentagon officials and a second by outside experts – as a result of a series of Associated Press stories that revealed lapses in leadership, morale, safety and security at the nation's three nuclear Air Force bases. The good news, Hagel said, 'is there has been no nuclear exchange in the world.' Acknowledging the years of neglect, which included glaring problems that prompted then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates to fire his top military and civilian Air Force leaders in 2008, Hagel vowed renewed accountability. 'Previous reviews of our nuclear enterprise lacked clear follow-up mechanisms,' he said. 'Recommendations were implemented without the necessary follow-through to assess that they were implemented effectively.' Hagel added that this time, people will be held accountable to ensure the improvements are done. Navy Adm. Cecil Haney, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said the nuclear force has been operating securely. 'You don't see the mushroom cloud or that sort of thing.  We must continue that,' he told reporters. Hagel's moves, while not dramatic, are designed to get at the core of the problem. Among his more significant moves, he authorized the Air Force to put a four-star general in charge of its nuclear forces, according to officials. The top Air Force nuclear commander currently is a three-star. Lt. Gen. Stephen Wilson is responsible not only for the 450 Minuteman ICBMs but also the nuclear bomber force. Hagel has concluded that a four-star would be able to exert more influence within the Air Force and send a signal to the entire force that the mission is taken seriously, the defense officials said. Hagel also OK'd a proposal to upgrade the top nuclear force official at Air Force headquarters in the Pentagon from a two-star general to a three-star. The review's authors, retired Air Force Gen. Larry D. Welch and retired Navy Adm. John C. Harvey Jr., found fault with one of the unique features of life in the nuclear forces. It is called the Personnel Reliability Program, designed to monitor the mental fitness of people to be entrusted with the world's deadliest weapons. Over time, that program has devolved into a burdensome administrative exercise that detracts from the mission, the authors found. Hagel ordered an overhaul. Hagel concluded that despite tight Pentagon budgets, billions of dollars more will be needed over the next five years to upgrade equipment. That will include a proposal to replace the Vietnam-era UH-1 Huey helicopter fleet that is part of the security forces at ICBM bases. The Air Force declared them out of date years ago but put available resources into other priorities. The Navy, which operates nuclear-armed submarines, has had its own problems, including an exam-cheating scandal this year among nuclear reactor training instructors and has suffered from a shortage of personnel. DYSFUNCTION: Missile maintenance crews often have to descend into silos to perform upkeep or repairs – which aren't possible without the right tools . America's nuclear weapons system still relies heavily on the Minuteman III missile . When he ordered the reviews, shortly after the Air Force announced it was investigating an exam-cheating ring at one ICBM base and a related drug investigation implicating missile crew members, Hagel was said to be flabbergasted that such misbehavior could be infecting the force. 'He said, 'What is going on here?'' said one senior defense official, who spoke about the review on condition of anonymity. Hans Kristensen, a nuclear expert with the Federation of American Scientists, said Thursday that while he had not seen the Hagel reviews or heard what actions Hagel was ordering, he was skeptical that it would make much difference. 'Throwing money after problems may fix some technical issues but it is unlikely to resolve the dissolution that must come from sitting in a silo hole in the Midwest with missiles on high alert to respond to a nuclear attack that is unlikely to ever come,' Kristensen said. A cascade of embarrassments befell the Air Force over the past two years, beginning with an AP story in May 2013 revealing one missile officer's lament of 'rot' inside the force. Another AP story in November disclosed that an independent assessment for the Air Force found signs of 'burnout' and elevated levels of personal misconduct among missile launch crews and missile security forces. The AP also disclosed last year that four ICBM launch officers were disciplined for violating security rules by opening the blast door to their underground command post while one crew member was asleep. Just last week the AP disclosed that the Air Force fired two nuclear commanders and disciplined a third, providing evidence that leadership lapses are continuing even as top Air Force officials attempt to bring stability to the ICBM force. After his Pentagon announcement Hagel was expected to fly to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, home of a Minuteman 3 missile unit whose recent setbacks are emblematic of the trouble dogging the broader nuclear force.","Toolkit needed to connect warheads to Minuteman III missiles were in short supply so three mechanic crews Fedexed one kit back and forth .

"She's rockstar royalty who grew up around Kate Moss, modelled for Chanel and counts Cara Delevingne and Harry Styles as her best friends - is Daisy Lowe Britain's coolest young model? It would seem so. American Eagle Outfitters - a popular US clothing brand -  wanted to tap into the magic so snapped the 25-year-old up to front its latest campaign - and she couldn't be happier about it. 'It's my perfect aesthetic,' she told MailOnline of her new campaign. 'The clothes are comfortable and cool and exactly what I wear myself. I am London born and bred so I am hoping to bring that edge to the campaign.' Scroll down for video . Starring role: Daisy Lowe has been unveiled as the face of US brand American Eagle Outfitters as it lands in the UK . Daisy, who grew up in Camden with mother Pearl Lowe, showcases the trendy label's denim shirts, cosy beanie hats and skinny jeans in the shoot. Exuding an edgy but relaxed vibe, Daisy says the whole campaign is an accurate reflection of her own style, which was shaped by trips to Portobello Road market with her mother. 'My mum would always take me to the market and buy these lace dresses and Dr. Martens. I felt like a Victorian witch at the time but it's actually shaped my style and I really love my mother's dress sense, it's amazing,' she said. One person she doesn't take style advice from is best friend and fellow model and muse, Alexa Chung. 'We're best friends, we don't sit around giving each other style advice. She does obviously have amazing style and always look brilliant though,' she adds. Daisy and Alexa are part of what's been dubbed 'the new Primrose Hill set', along with Nick Grimshaw, Harry Styles, Pixie Geldof and Cara Delevingne. They frequent the capital's hottest parties, set the trends and have a good time doing it - but you won't catch Daisy taking it for granted. She relishes every opportunity and still gets starstruck despite her starry roster of pals. Daisy, who cites walking in Burberry's show as her ultimate career coup, said: 'Meeting Tom Ford was pretty unreal. I couldn't believe my luck at wearing his clothes. He said to me ""You look amazing and you smell amazing"", it was unreal,' she gushed. Perfect fit: Daisy said the campaign is her perfect aesthetic and thinks the clothes are comfortable and cool and exactly what she loves to wear herself . Lading lady: Daisy Lowe attends the American Eagle Outfitters VIP store launch at Westfield London last night as she reveals her mother shaped her style by taking her shopping at local markets . Despite being one of Britain's most famous clothes horses, Daisy doesn't starve herself and recently penned a cookbook, Sweetness and Light, full of healthy recipes. Speaking about her diet, she said: 'I like to do everything in moderation but I'm certainly no angel! The horrible food guilt feeling is the reason I wrote my book, it's the worst! 'When I eat wheat and sugar, I can actually feel it and it feels like I've been badly behaved. If I eat chocolate, I notice a spot from it a few days later.' Instead, she created recipes such as  goji berry chocolates, which are a big hit with her pals who raid her fridge for her healthy treats when they come over. 'I wanted to share self-loving recipes with the world. As a society, we are so self-depricating and I wanted to find a way we could feel good,' she added. Staying trim: Daisy says she is no angel but credits healthy treats, swimming and meditation for her balanced lifestyle . She also credits working out four times a week, swimming classes and pilates as the secrets behind her healthy figure. Meditation, which has become a favourite amongst celebrities in recent months, is also key to her lifestyle. 'My godmother got me into it. After she started doing it, I noticed a stillness behind her eyes, a quiet calmness that I wanted.' It took Daisy four months to master the art but now she meditates twice a day - on trains, in hair and makeup and in taxis - and says it helps the flow of her day. So what's next for the in-demand young star? 'I have plans but I'm keeping them to myself,' she said. 'I keep my wishes to myself because if I tell anyone, then they might not come true.' Fashion's darlings: Fashion models Suki Waterhouse, Daisy Lowe, Clara Paget and Cara Delevingne attend Ambassador Barzun, Mrs Brooke Barzun and Alexandra Shulman's celebration of London Fashion Week at Winfield House in association with J Crew and Vogue .

"A driver who accidentally drove his semi-truck across a footbridge before getting stuck attempting to cross another has claimed he was simply following the GPS. The unidentified driver, from Louisiana, caused some damage - and a fair few laughs - when he drove the vehicle onto a walkway in Milwaukee's historic Lake Park on Tuesday afternoon. He managed to steer the truck over one narrow footbridge in the park, living up to the motto emblazoned on the side of his truck: 'We drive a fine line.' Scroll down for video . Oops: A semi truck became stuck trying to cross a footbridge in Milwaukee's Lake Park on Tuesday . Nice try: The semi managed to cross one footbridge, seen bottom left, before getting stuck on the second . Astonishingly, the bridge held the weight of the semi, which was empty, but a historian told WISN that it could have caused the path to collapse if the vehicle had been full of bricks. The 50-year-old driver, who works for Kentucky-based Paschall Truck Lines, was taken to hospital as a precaution after the truck came to a stop on Tuesday. In his path, he damaged several trees and concrete railings. He has been fined $579.80 for reckless driving and failure to obey signs, the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office said on Wednesday. Ray's Towing Co. managed to remove the truck over three hours on Wednesday. Fitting: Along the side of the truck, owned by a Kentucky company, read: 'We drive a fine line' Damage: The driver caused damage to the side of the bridge, as well as several trees in the park . Mark Salentine, from the company, told the Journal-Sentinel that the job took 'more finesse than force - and some patience'. 'This certainly was a challenge - a creative challenge,' he told the publication. The two bridges were inspected by a structural engineer, who deemed them safe for people to use.

"Mama June has revealed that TLC is still paying for her daughters' tuition and 'some other things' despite canceling their show following reports she was dating a child molester. TLC dropped the show after images emerged apparently showing Mama June with Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years in prison for molesting her daughter Anna when she was eight. Even though she denies they are in a relationship, Mama June  told Dr Phil that she has no ill-feelings towards the network for cancelling the show. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: In an exclusive interview set to air on Dr Phil next week, June 'Mama June' Shannon has again denied she is in a relationship with her daughter's molester, claiming he is now seeing someone else . Fears: TLC canceled the show after reports that Mama June had allowed her nine-year-old daughter Honey Boo Boo, pictured chatting with Dr Phil, to have contact with the molester, Mark McDaniel . 'I have nothing bad to say about TLC,' she said in the interview. 'They have been good to me. They still are very good to me.' She explained that, despite rumors she was not going to get paid, she has received money from the network - as have her estranged husband Sugar Bear and other stars of the show. 'They're still taking care of the girls today with tutoring, which I'm very, very grateful for,' she said. 'They're taking care of some other things for the girls, I'm very, very grateful for. And I'm grateful for the experience.' Despite holding no grudges against the network, she claims that their reason for cancelling the show - her allowing her children to be near McDaniel - is simply not true. She claims that at least one of the photos showing them together since his release earlier this year has been photo shopped. Together: Mama June is pictured walking to the Dr Phil interview with her daughters, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson . Not-so-happy families: Despite their smiles, Mama June claimed in the interview that she is no longer with Sugar Bear and does not love him. She said he cheated on her earlier this year, leading to their break up . All smiles: The family has been steeped in scandal after photos of Mama June and McDaniel emerged . 'I would never take my child around someone like that,' she told Dr Phil. Still, she would not shed any light on the investigation by child protective services. 'I can't talk about that issue,' she said. 'I was told by them not to talk about that issue... The only part I can say is that they're not saying that they're in a unsafe environment.' She previously claimed she has only seen him McDaniel since his release - one coincidentally and once to give her daughter, Pumpkin, some closure because she believed he was her father. 'He's moved on,' she told Dr Phil of McDaniel. 'He's got a girlfriend and it's not me.' She added that she is also no longer in a relationship with Sugar Bear - her husband and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson's father. 'He cheated,' she insisted. 'He hurt me a lot. I am not in love with him.' Victim: Her daughter Anna Cardwell, now 20, said she was molested by McDaniel when she was eight . 'Fakes': Mama June said at least one image of her with McDaniel was photo shopped. Here she is apparently pictured with her daughter Honey Boo Boo and Mark McDaniel, who is touching the girl . Sugar Bear and one of her daughters, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, will also appear in interviews with Dr, Phil. Following the abuse in 2002, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell told police that McDaniel had abused her repeatedly, sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed next to her. Since the scandal emerged, Anna has said that Pumpkin has turned against her and stood up for her mother because she believes that McDaniel is her father. Mama June has denied this is the case. Pumpkin told Dr Phil that she is still trying to come to terms with exactly what happened. 'Now that I'm 14, I understand a little bit more which, I mean, I have a lot of questions,' she said. 'I asked Mama what happened. You know, I guess that I wanted closure on actually who he was. I wanted to actually know for sure if he did what he did, or if he didn't, you know? I mean, I guess that's the questions I've had.' Mama June is pictured with (clockwise from left) eldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee', 20, ex-husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, and daughters Lauryn 'Pumpkin', 14, Jessica 'Chubbs', 18, and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Honey Boo Boo and Mama June are seen outside their home after pictures emerged of them with McDaniel . In a previous interview, Mama June said that 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel. At aged nine, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' is a year older than her sister Anna was when she says she was abused by McDaniel. The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September.

"There's dumb, there's dumber ... and then there's Mama June. Besieged by a sex scandal that could see her lose custody of her children, the 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' matriarch is now one of the star cameo's in Dumb and Dumber 2, it has been revealed. In the long-awaited sequel, out this weekend, Mama June plays the trailer park wife of the character Harry - played by Jeff Daniels - in a short dream sequence. The former TLC personality revealed the guest role on the Facebook page of her daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, saying she was honored to work with comedy duo Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly. According to PEOPLE, her scene shows the character Lloyd - played by Jim Carrey - going to pick up Harry's young daughter for a date, only to grope the breast of Mama June instead. Scroll down for video . Bad timing: Mama June Shannon filmed a racy cameo role in Dumb and Dumber To with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels which hits cinemas this weekend, while her tell-all with Dr Phil about the sex scandal that has engulfed her family will be aired Monday . Big reveal: Mama June announced the guest role on the Facebook page of her daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, saying she was honored to work with comedy duo Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly . Entertainment Weekly reported the scene was 'troubling' because 'Carrey’s character is essentially lusting for a girl half his age'. Mama June's appearance in the comedy - which has been panned by critics - was kept a secret until the movie hit cinemas. The film was shot earlier this year. In October it emerged that Mama June was dating a man convicted of child molestation, who was alleged to have assaulted her own daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, when she was a child. Mama June was dating the man, Mark McDaniel, at the time, and the molestation conviction sent him to prison for 10 years. Universal Pictures, the distributors of Dumb and Dumber To, have not commented on Mama June's appearance. Despite bad reviews, Variety believes the film is set for a box office opening between $36 million to $40 million this weekend. The cameo is one of many controversies to plague Mama June this week. She also revealed that TLC is still paying for her daughters' tuition and 'some other things' despite canceling their show following reports she was dating a child molester. TLC dropped the show after images emerged apparently showing Mama June with McDaniel. Even though she denies they are in a relationship, Mama June  told Dr Phil that she has no ill-feelings towards the network for cancelling the show. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: In an exclusive interview set to air on Dr Phil next week, June 'Mama June' Shannon has again denied she is in a relationship with her daughter's molester, claiming he is now seeing someone else . Fears: TLC canceled the show after reports that Mama June had allowed her nine-year-old daughter Honey Boo Boo, pictured chatting with Dr Phil, to have contact with the molester, Mark McDaniel . 'I have nothing bad to say about TLC,' she said in the interview. 'They have been good to me. They still are very good to me.' She explained that, despite rumors she was not going to get paid, she has received money from the network - as have her estranged husband Sugar Bear and other stars of the show. 'They're still taking care of the girls today with tutoring, which I'm very, very grateful for,' she said. 'They're taking care of some other things for the girls, I'm very, very grateful for. And I'm grateful for the experience.' Despite holding no grudges against the network, she claims that their reason for cancelling the show - her allowing her children to be near McDaniel - is simply not true. She claims that at least one of the photos showing them together since his release earlier this year has been photo shopped. Together: Mama June is pictured walking to the Dr Phil interview with her daughters, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson . Not-so-happy families: Despite their smiles, Mama June claimed in the interview that she is no longer with Sugar Bear and does not love him. She said he cheated on her earlier this year, leading to their break up . All smiles: The family has been steeped in scandal after photos of Mama June and McDaniel emerged . 'I would never take my child around someone like that,' she told Dr Phil. Still, she would not shed any light on the investigation by child protective services. 'I can't talk about that issue,' she said. 'I was told by them not to talk about that issue... The only part I can say is that they're not saying that they're in a unsafe environment.' She previously claimed she has only seen him McDaniel since his release - one coincidentally and once to give her daughter, Pumpkin, some closure because she believed he was her father. 'He's moved on,' she told Dr Phil of McDaniel. 'He's got a girlfriend and it's not me.' She added that she is also no longer in a relationship with Sugar Bear - her husband and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson's father. 'He cheated,' she insisted. 'He hurt me a lot. I am not in love with him.' Victim: Her daughter Anna Cardwell, now 20, said she was molested by McDaniel when she was eight . 'Fakes': Mama June said at least one image of her with McDaniel was photo shopped. Here she is apparently pictured with her daughter Honey Boo Boo and Mark McDaniel, who is touching the girl . Sugar Bear and one of her daughters, Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, will also appear in interviews with Dr, Phil. Following the abuse in 2002, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell told police that McDaniel had abused her repeatedly, sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was in bed next to her. Since the scandal emerged, Anna has said that Pumpkin has turned against her and stood up for her mother because she believes that McDaniel is her father. Mama June has denied this is the case. Pumpkin told Dr Phil that she is still trying to come to terms with exactly what happened. 'Now that I'm 14, I understand a little bit more which, I mean, I have a lot of questions,' she said. 'I asked Mama what happened. You know, I guess that I wanted closure on actually who he was. I wanted to actually know for sure if he did what he did, or if he didn't, you know? I mean, I guess that's the questions I've had.' Mama June is pictured with (clockwise from left) eldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee', 20, ex-husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, and daughters Lauryn 'Pumpkin', 14, Jessica 'Chubbs', 18, and Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' In a previous interview, Mama June said that 12 other people were in the room when she took Pumpkin to see McDaniel. At aged nine, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' is a year older than her sister Anna was when she says she was abused by McDaniel. The children's uncle, Uncle Poodle, has also claimed in an interview that he witnessed the young girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and Mama June during a trip to North Carolina in September. 'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle - real name Lee Thompson - told the National Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted.

It included 30-minute work outs at home, shunning diets, and enjoying food in moderation - and particularly a glass of wine. Writing in Waitrose magazine, Pippa said: 'I grew up with the belief that good health is about moderation in all things, so I'll be celebrating healthy living through exercise, a balanced diet and a little of the naughty stuff sprinkled in - I'm talking chocolate, crisps and the occasional glass of wine. 'I've never done Dukan, attempted Atkins or exercised religiously seven days a week, but I do believe in making healthy choices - keeping refined carbs such as white bread and pasta to a minimum, and sticking to sensible portion sizes.'

NBC News previously denied that a deal was in the works but the network has reportedly been in serious talks with Pippa for months about becoming a lifestyle and health correspondent. Excited locals in Jackson Hole, posted pictures all over social media of Miss Middleton this week, dressed in boots, skinny jeans and wearing a checked shirt. Pippa performed a routine which involved some twirling and sashaying with an elderly gent in a cowboy hat before going on to have a drink at the bar.

Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network. It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role. NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.

"Marie Stopes was one of the most influential women of the 20th century: a distinguished fossil expert, brilliant academic and pioneer of birth control. Also a feminist visionary, she opened the first birth control clinic in Britain and her book, Married Love — which argued marriage should be an equal relationship between husband and wife — was an international bestseller. And yet, in her private life, she was a staggeringly selfish monster. Selfish monster: Maris Stopes treated her son Harry like a social experiment . She was anti-Semitic and believed fervently in eugenics — or “improving” the human population through selective breeding. Though she made her name as a marital expert she publicly humiliated her two husbands. The greatest irony of all though, was that the woman who wrote another bestseller, Wise Parenthood was an atrocious mother. She treated her only son as a social experiment, dressing him up in girl’s clothes, choosing, and then discarding, adoptive brothers for him, and later cruelly victimising his wife. When Marie Stopes died in 1958, at the age of 77, her son found she had cut him out of much of her will, she had remained so angry at his marriage. That son, Dr Harry Stopes-Roe has just died aged 90. Remarkably, not only did he survive his mother’s wicked treatment, but he flourished as a philosopher and remained happily married to his own wife for nearly 70 years. He even defended his mother against riticism and censure. His willingness to forgive his horrific parent is all the more extraordinary when you consider the misery of his childhood. Wicked treatment: Harry's willingness to forgive his horrific parent is extraordinary when you consider the misery of his childhood . Marie Stopes didn’t allow him to read books when younger, because she thought they stopped children thinking for themselves. Until the age of 11, he was forced to wear skirts as his mother took against trousers, which she considered ‘ugly and heating-in-the-wrong-places garments’. Bicycles — thought equally wicked by her — were also banned. Honoured: Marie Stopes House in London . When Harry Stopes-Roe was born in 1924, his mother was 43 and world famous. Her father was a prosperous brewer, her mother a Shakespearean scholar, and she was brought up in an intellectual hothouse. The first female academic at the University of Manchester, she became an expert on fossils before turning her mind to birth control. Her 1918 book, Married Love, sold 750,000 copies and made her a household name. She edited newsletter Birth Control News. Her Mothers’ Clinic in Holloway, North London, opened in 1921 and was the first in the country to offer birth control advice. Over the next 22 years, more opened nationwide. During her lifetime, none offered terminations. An anti-abortionist, Stopes argued that preventing pregnancy through birth control was the way forward. But, as her professional career flourished, her private life was torn apart by her raging megalomania and a belief she was some sort of divine messiah. When she addressed a conference of Anglican bishops, she greeted them with: ‘My Lords, I speak to you in the name of God. You are his priests. I am his prophet. I speak to you of the mysteries of man and woman.’ Her first marriage to Reginald Ruggles Gates, a Canadian geneticist, was a disaster. After marrying in 1911, Stopes filed for divorce just two years later on the grounds that the marriage was never consummated. Gates’ sexual failure became widely-known — a shameful humiliation for the distinguished scientist. Banished: Marie heartbreakingly stopped her second husband Humphrey Roe from seeing their son . Her second marriage in 1918 to Humphrey Roe, a rich philanthropist and World War I flying ace, wasn’t much more successful. Though they had a son together she soon grew bored by Roe as a lover and companion. She forced him to write a letter — which she dictated — freeing her from their marriage vows. Though they did not divorce, she banished Roe to the attic of their 18th-century mansion, only letting him enter family rooms if he had first completed chores. The separation from his son caused Roe anguish. ‘I hope you will allow me to see Harry sometimes,’ was his heartbreaking plea to his wife. She became obsessed with her only child and set out to control him to a horrifying degree. Too old to have any more children and worried Harry would be lonely and anti-social without a sibling, Marie Stopes advertised for an adopted brother, who had to be ‘absolutely healthy, intelligent and not circumcised’. The first candidate, Robin, was a three-year-old orphan, reluctantly handed over by loving, but poor, aunts. Two years later, they took him back, horrified, when Marie Stopes said their nephew would be improved by ‘a few whippings’. Then came Dick, who was sent back to the National Children’s Adoption Society because he would ‘never bloom so as to be a credit to us’. The third adopted brother, John,  was rejected because he lacked ‘academic ability and literary and artistic sensibility’. Barry, the fourth, was renamed Roy by Stopes because she didn’t like his original name. When he wet himself — one can imagine through sheer terror and distress  — she declared he was ‘unfit to live in a decent household’. Lonely childhood: Marie became obsessed with her only child and set out to control him to a horrifying degree . In this desperate, lonely childhood, one of Harry’s few consolations was his family’s friendship with Ernest Shepard, the illustrator of Winnie The Pooh. Shepard once sent a deeply poignant letter to the little boy, with a sketch of Pooh crying at the prospect of not making his birthday party. Shepard wrote, ‘Dear Buffkins [Harry’s nickname]. I am very sory that I cant come to yr party but I am going away to the igsle of wite on Saturday 24nd and I am verry verry sory. Pooh.’ In spite of everything, Harry flourished. After Charterhouse school, he read physics at Imperial College London, then gained a PhD in philosophy at St John’s College, Cambridge, and embarked on an academic career. But it proved impossible to escape his mother’s bullying. She was determined to decide who her son would marry, someone who would be ‘his peer in looks, inheritance and health’. Admirer of Hitler: Marie sent a copy of a collection of her poems, Love Songs For Young Lovers, to Hitler . When Harry fell for childhood friend Mary Eyre Wallis, daughter of Sir Barnes Wallis, inventor of the bouncing bomb, his mother reacted with fury. Mary was short-sighted — a sign of terrible genetic weakness, according to Stopes’s unpalatable eugenicist views. She wrote: ‘Mary and Harry are quite callous about both the wrong to their children, the wrong to my family, and the eugenic crime.’ Stopes was a fellow of the Eugenics Society and, in 1921, founded the Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress. Its aim was to promote eugenic birth control. She backed ‘the sterilisation of those totally unfit for parenthood [including] the inferior, the depraved, and the feeble-minded’. She believed, too, in the idea of ‘racial degeneration’, caused by sexually-transmitted diseases and ‘overcrowding’. She refused to have a Jewish refugee child to lunch during World War  II, saying it would offend guests. In 1942, she wrote a poem which said: ‘Catholics, Prussians / The Jews and the Russians / All are a curse / Or something worse.’ She even sent a copy of a collection of her poems, Love Songs For Young Lovers, to Hitler, whom she greatly admired. She wrote: ‘Dear Herr Hitler, Love is the greatest thing in the world: so will you accept from me these [poems] that you may allow the young people of your nation to have them? ‘The young must learn love from the particular till they are wise enough for the universal. I hope too that you yourself may find something to enjoy in the book.’ So incensed was she by her daughter-in-law’s supposed genetic weakness, that she refused to attend the wedding. And, when Stopes died of breast cancer a decade later, she cut Harry out of her will almost entirely because she believed ‘he had betrayed her by this marriage’. She bequeathed Harry 13 volumes of the Greater Oxford English Dictionary and a Cornish cottage, while her large fortune went to the Eugenics Society and Royal Society of Literature. Wickedly selfish: When Stopes died of breast cancer she cut Harry out of her will almost entirely . And yet throughout his life he continued to defend his mother and the contribution she made to sex education and the welfare of the poor. He even said he was now ‘prepared to laugh’ at the way he had been brought up. Meanwhile, his own career prospered. After Cambridge, he became a lecturer at Birmingham University and later rose to become vice-president of the British Humanist Association. His marriage to Mary, a fellow academic, was a deeply happy one. Together they had four children and when their two boys and two girls were young they would all holiday together in Cornwall. He set out to create his own ideal of ‘Married Love’ and endeavoured to right with his own children all the appalling wrongs of his own wickedly selfish mother.","Marie was anti-Semitic, believed in eugenics and sent Hitler love poems .

"An Indian domestic worker was repeatedly raped and beaten by her employers who threatened to murder her if she complained, a court heard. The 39-year-old vulnerable and . illiterate mother-of-four was used as a 'sexual toy' and 'general . dogsbody' by an extended family and their friend who forced her to become their slave for a total of six . years. She was scalded with boiling water, burned with a hot iron, beaten and threatened her throat would be cut and her body buried in a back garden if she didn't do as she was told, a jury were told today. Despite the woman approaching numerous agencies for help, Croydon Crown Court heard how the abuse continued. Employers: A court heard that Aleemuddin Mohammed, 44, and his wife Shamina Yousuf, 42, assaulted the woman and paid her just £24 during the two years and eight months she 'worked as their slave' The court heard how the woman initially went to live with Aleemuddin Mohammed, 44, a supermarket manager, and his wife Shamina Yousuf, 42, after they successfully applied for the woman's . visa. Both are accused of assaulting the woman and paying her just £24 during the two years and eight months she worked for them. The woman was then allegedly forced to moved in with Mohammed's mother, 56-year-old shop worker Shanaz Begum, and her partner, butcher Enkarta Balapovi, 53, who is accused of raping her. After escaping the couple, she was then sent to live with an acquaintance of the family, optician Shashi Obhrai, 53, from Northwood, who is accused of assaulting her. Prosecutor Miss Caroline Haughey said: 'Each of these defendants treated her . with contempt, ignoring her basic rights and taking advantage of her . naivety, her vulnerability and her ignorance. 'Each of the defendants knew of her lack . of education, expectation and awareness, both in the UK and India, . and used that to get her to comply with their wishes whether as a . domestic worker, sexual toy or general dogsbody. Accused: Enkarta Balapovi is accused of raping the woman while his partner Shanaz Begum is alleged to have arranged her transportation to the UK to be exploited by her family . 'She slept in the garage or on the floor . of the child's room. She was expected to wash, cook and clean for the . family and be at their beck and call.' The court heard how the woman was initially promised £480 . a month when she moved into the Pavilion Way address with Mohammed, his . wife Shamina Yousuf and their child. The mother worked sixteen hours a day, seven days a week, between October 2004 and October 2010. At the minimum wage rate, she should have been paid £172,288. In reality, the court heard, she received just £2,364. The couple also confiscated her passport so she could not flee the country. Ms Haughey said: 'Yousuf was short-tempered and aggressive with her. She recalls being beaten around the head, causing her ears to bleed, and Yousuf poured boiling water over her hands and forbid her to receive any medical treatment.' When Yousuf allegedly threw a cup at the victim, causing a two inch cut to her foot, she was arrested. Co-defendant: Shashi Obhrai is also accused of causing actual bodily harm to the woman, making threats to kill and trafficking within the UK . But Mohammed scared the woman into dropping the allegation and the police did not pursue the complaints she made to them. After two years and eight months with the couple, who paid just £24 for that period, the victim escaped with the help of a Pakistani stranger at a supermarket. But desperate to get her passport back, she agreed to move in with the couple's in-laws Balapovi and Begum, where she massaged their legs and feet and was forced to work for £2-per hour at a sandwich shop downstairs. 'It was while at this address she was subjected to a catalogue of sexual assaults by Balapovi,' said Miss Haughey. 'She describes how this happened repeatedly, usually on weekends, Mondays and Tuesdays. She says it happened for: ""As long as I lived in the house"".' After four months with the couple the victim was assisted by a charity and her rape complaints reported to the police, but she was then handed over to an acquaintance of her previous 'employers', Obhrai, and her ordeal continued. Her daily routine included cooking for eight people, washing, cleaning, looking after Obhrai's sick mother and enduring beatings, hair pulling and threats at the hands of the defendant. She was hospitalised after being pushed down a flight of stairs, struck with a rolling pin, burned with a hot iron and suffered stomach cramps and vomiting when forced to eat out of date food, the jury were told. Again the victim fled and reported the abuse to police, but no action was taken and the beatings continued, with Obhrai threatening to slit her throat and bury her in the back garden. Eventually she contacted the charity Kalayaan, which campaigns for justice for migrant workers, who referred her to the UK Human Trafficking Centre and an investigation began. Ms Haughey continued: 'Each of these defendants have collectively and severally taken advantage of her. 'Abusing her in their own way and, . when she either becomes a threat or a nuisance, is passed on to the next . party until she is no longer wanted. 'Their view of her has resulted in a prolonged and continued abuse of her. 'Tragically various state agencies . failed her too, ignoring her repeated pleas for help, not adhering to . their own investigative practices, and it could be said ignoring the . obvious.' Balapovi has pleaded not guilty to five counts of rape and along with his partner Begum two separate counts of arranging travel within the UK for exploitation. Mohammed denies one count of trafficking within the UK for exploitation and sexually assaulting the victim. Obhrai and Yousouf deny separate counts of causing actual bodily harm and Obhrai alone denies making threats to kill and trafficking within the UK for exploitation. The trial continues.

"A couple with a combined weight of 45st shed nearly half their bulk after being told they would be dead in a few years if they carried on overeating. Joanne Richards and Barry Ricketts had both been overweight since childhood and were dubbed Fatty Jo and Big Baz by school bullies. The pair were both so unfit they struggled to get round the house they shared in Stourbridge in the West Midlands. Miss Richards even stored her clothes downstairs because she could not make it up to their bedroom to get changed. 'Before' (left) and 'after' (right) holiday snaps of Joanne Richards, 31, and Barry Ricketts, 43, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, show their incredible transformation . The 31-year-old tipped the scales at 24st 5lbs and wore a size 32, while her long-term partner Mr Ricketts, 43, was 21st and wore a six XXXL trouser. It was not until Miss Richards' periods stopped and they were both warned that their size was putting a strain on their bodies, that the couple,  paired up to lose weight. 'I was told I would die by the time I was 40 if I kept going the way I was,' Miss Richards says. 'I couldn't believe how bad we'd got and knew it was now or never to lose weight. It had to happen.' Left: Joanne Richards, 31, weighted 24st 5lbs and Barry Ricketts, 43 was 21st; Right: Joanne lost 13st 7lbs and now weighs 10st 12lbs and Barry lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight, 13st 9lbs . 'I was told I would die by the time I was 40 if I kept going the way I was,' Miss Richards says . She started gaining weight when she was nine and was bullied because of it. She said: 'The kids at school called me Fatty and Big Jo. I should have lost weight but I comfort ate instead. I snacked on crisps and chocolates, and on my way home I'd stop in the chippy. 'Before long I was on a takeaway a day.' By 25, Miss Richards weighed more than 20st and her health was suffering. She said: 'I huffed and puffed everywhere I went but it didn't stop me eating.' In 2008, Miss Richards' partner moved in and after a hard day's work, they found it easier to grab a pizza or Chinese than prepare a healthy meal. Miss Richards said: 'I made sure our son, Josh, ate healthily, but Barry and I continued to eat junk. Miss Richards ditched the takeaways and in March 2012 she joined her local Weight Watchers class. She said: 'I was taught how to follow their healthy eating plan, find healthy alternatives and eat smaller portions' Miss Richards with son Josh before (left) and after (right) she dropped weight. She says: 'He'd want to go for a walk or play football and we'd make excuses. It must have hurt him to always hear ""no""' 'Soon, being overweight not only affected our health but our relationship with Josh too. 'He'd want to go for a walk or play football and we'd make excuses to avoid anything energetic. We were so unfit. 'It must have hurt him to hear ""no"" all the time.' Then in November 2011, Miss Richards' periods stopped and she was told it was because of her weight. A dietician said losing 13st would improve her health, and suggested a gastric band. She said: 'At first I thought it was a great idea, an easy way to lose weight. Mr Ricketts before, (left), and after (right) his transformation: He offered to show his support by eating the same low-calories meals as Joanne then joined Weight Watchers too . 'But I'd always loved food and when I realised it would mean I would never be able to eat properly again, I said no. 'I didn't want to lose weight so fast I was left with saggy skin, too. So I decided to try and lose weight on my own.' Miss Richards ditched the takeaways and in March 2012 she joined her local Weight Watchers class. She said: 'I was taught how to follow their healthy eating plan, find healthy alternatives and eat smaller portions. My group leader was full of tips.' Feeling encouraged following her first class, Miss Richards decided to walk to her mum's house three miles away to get some exercise, but things didn't go to plan. 'It should have taken me an hour, but it took me four,' she said. 'I'd always thought I was young so I was healthy, but I kept stopping because my knees and feet hurt. Miss Richards (left, after her weight loss, and right, with son Josh before she shed the pounds) even used to store her clothes downstairs because she couldn't make it up to the bedroom to get changed . 'I got out of breath and suddenly realised just how unfit I was.' Mr Ricketts offered to show his support by eating the same low-calories meals as her. Then when he saw her lose half a stone a week, he joined Weight Watchers too. Mr Ricketts said: 'I'd always thought I could eat what I liked – massive curries, all-you-can-eat carveries. 'I had a huge appetite and would only stop when my stomach hurt. I didn't care how I looked. Eating made me happy. 'But my health was suffering too and I realised someone of my size could have a severely reduced mortality and I wanted to live to see my son grow up. 'So I decided to lose weight as well. I'd always thought it would be hard work and I'd never be a normal size. I guess I'd accepted my lot.' Mr Rickards (left, before his diet, right with son Josh) lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight, 13st 9lbs . But the couple spurred each other on, and as the weight fell off, they even started exercising. 'We went for walks together, to the gym twice a week, and swimming,' Miss Richards said: 'I wouldn't have dared do any of that before. I would have been too embarrassed to walk around in a swimsuit, and too unfit.' They also went on bike rides with Josh, now 11, and walked their dog, a Lurcher. Miss Richards said: 'Suddenly we had all this energy to keep fit, which kept the weight off.' In early 2013 she even took part in two walking marathons. While her partner – who had lost 7st 5lbs and reached his goal weight, 13st 9lbs – ditched his XXXL trousers for slim, medium jeans. Later that year Miss Richards also launched her first slimming class. After losing 13st 7lbs and weighing 10st 12lbs, she wanted to help others. Miss Richards, who's now a size 12, said: 'I love seeing my members reach their goals. 'I'm really pleased I didn't turn to surgery to lose weight, and did it with Barry. 'Doing it as a couple helped us keep going. I couldn't have done it alone. 'We can do so much more with Josh now, too, which is great.' Mr Ricketts added: 'We're so much happier now, how we look and feel. 'Losing weight has brought us all closer together.'","Joanne Richards, 31, weighed 24st 5lbs and Barry Ricketts, 43 was 21st .

"In a house boasting 45 bedrooms set over seven storeys, you can bet it’s a bit of a faff if you need a glass of water in the night. That said, if you’ve got the £300million needed to buy this super-mansion, there’s every chance that will be someone else’s problem. The London residence by Hyde Park has come on the market following the death of owner Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. A very des res: The £300million 'family home' on sale facing Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, which used to be owned by the late Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri . Former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri pictured in 2000 with his Wife Nazek Audeh . The house was also owned by Rafiq Hariri, the late former prime minister of Lebanon and billionaire tycoon, until his assassination by a huge bomb in Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in 2005. After . his death, it was given as a gift to Sultan bin Abdulaziz, the late . Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, with whom Mr Hariri had close business . ties. Leading London estate agents Savills . and Beauchamp Estates both told the FT the property, which is not . officially on the market, is probably the largest single family home . left in London. If it sells it will become the most expensive private home in Britain,  more than double the previous UK . house-price record of £140million. The incredible price tag shows how far the luxury London . property market has boomed even as the UK economy tanks. It is being offered to a select list of wealthy international buyers. With a valuation nearly 800 times the average London property price of £388,000, it seems set to become the most expensive home ever sold in Britain. Originally built as four separate family houses, the grand seven-storey, stucco-fronted residence runs from 2-8A Rutland Gate, Knightsbridge. The 60,000sq/ft living space - only slightly smaller than a football pitch - includes a large swimming pool, industrial-size catering kitchen, underground parking and several lifts. Millions of pounds worth of gold leaf adorn the internal decor, it is rumoured, and the windows of the house, of which 68 face towards Hyde Park, are thought to be bullet proof. The living space - only slightly smaller than a football pitch - includes a large swimming pool, industrial-size catering kitchen, underground parking and several lifts . Charles McDowell, a London-based consultant specialising in high-end residential property, said: 'It is a truly rarefied property.' Rafiq Al-Hariri was a business tycoon who made his fortune as head of the main construction firm used by the Saudi Royal family for important developments. He had two stints as Prime Minister of Lebanon - from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 until his resignation on October 20, 2004. He died months after leaving office, when explosives equivalent to around 1000kg of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove passed the St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. The investigation into the assassination is still ongoing, with initial reports indicating that the Syrian government may be linked to the assassination. Hariri's killing led to massive political change in Lebanon, including the Cedar Revolution and the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon. Hariri dominated the country's post-war political and business life and is widely credited with reconstructing Beirut after the 15-year civil war. Charles . McDowell, a London-based consultant specialising in high-end residential . property, told the paper: 'It is a truly rarefied property on the . market and whoever buys it is going to pay a lot of premium for the . unusual size in that location.' He added: 'You are going to have to wait a long, long time for something like this to come on the market again.' Oliver Hooper, from high-end property . purchasing agency Huntly Hooper, said: 'The property is one of London’s . most unique residences and really only comparable to two others. 'Those are Bridgewater House next to St . James’s Palace, which is owned by the Latsis family, and Dudley House, . in Mayfair owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is the Emir . of Qatar. 'As Bridgewater . House and Dudley House are not for sale, I suspect this will be the only . chance to get a house of this size in the area for a good number of . years.' He added: 'We heard . it might be coming up for sale about six months ago and there will be a . number of potential buyers for this despite the price tag. 'The house is located overlooking Hyde Park, but there are security screens on the windows so no-one can see inside. The seven-storey property, located in the heart of Knightsbridge, has been valued at 1,300 times the price of the average UK home . Spread over 60,000sq ft, the palatial residence has several lifts, underground parking and a decor rumoured to contain millions of pounds worth of gold leaf . 'I suspect the buyer will be foreign and the purchase of it kept very confidential.' Mr Hooper added that from a valuation . point of view, the asking price is accurate - with properties nearby . selling for considerably more than the £5,000 per sq/ft. The current record for a UK house . price sale is £140million for Park Place, a 300-year-old country house . that backs on to the Thames near Henley. The . Grade II-listed Franco-Italianate mansion was sold by developer Michael . Spink in an off-market deal with an unidentified Russian buyer in . August last year. The . Rutland Gate property is three times the £100million asking price of . Heath Hall in Hampstead, which was previously the most expensive house . currently for sale in London. London's . premium property market, defined as the top 5 per cent of the market by . value, has in the past two years attracted billions in investment from . overseas buyers. Thanks to . the interest from wealthy foreign investors, prices in this bracket have . risen 49 per cent since March 2009 according to estate agents Knight . Frank.

"Tens of thousands of teenagers are avoiding being punished for crimes by simply saying sorry – even to girls they have raped. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday show that more than 30,000 young people who admitted crimes including sexual assault, violence, possession of hard drugs and carrying guns have escaped prosecution over the past year. Instead, they have just apologised or tried to make amends. It means they do not have to go to court, risk jail or a fine, and do not receive a criminal record. Hard time: Supporters of restorative justice say it frees up space in crowded prisons and stops first-time offenders from descending into a life of crime. But it is being used for violent and sexual offences . Supporters of the initiative, known as restorative justice or community resolution, claim it is a fairer way to deal with first-time offenders while still giving closure to those they have wronged. But critics fear it allows young thugs to get away with serious crimes. Jack Dromey, Labour’s Shadow Policing Minister, said: ‘It is disturbing that restorative justice is being used for indictable offences including sexual assault. These figures are alarming.’ Since last April, the Home Office has required police forces to submit statistics on informal resolution, and this is the first time such detailed figures have been released. Deaf student Kirsty Mills, 21, said the boy who came to apologise for egging her home smirked . Statistics from 40 British forces show that between April 2013 and January this year, 37,168 offences by under-18s were dealt with informally. Over the same period, 43,188 youths were prosecuted. Guidance from the Association of Chief Police Officers says it is risky to deal informally with crimes such as domestic abuse or sexual assault because of the risk of further offences. The figures, however, show that 222 sexual offences were dealt with by community resolution. In the past two years, Devon and Cornwall Police have dealt informally with three teenage rapes, while Staffordshire Police have done the same with four rapes in the past year. In addition, 11,436 acts of violence were resolved in this way, including serious offences of wounding. There were 13 incidents of assaults on police, and dozens of public order, harassment, racist abuse and even threats to kill. At least 152 young people were caught with weapons such as knives yet spared prosecution, and at least six when they had guns. Common uses of restorative justice include shoplifting and criminal damage, with youths apologising to shopkeepers or painting over graffiti. But the alternative was also used in 2,436 cases of drug possession, some involving ecstasy and ketamine. Some of the activities ordered have been criticised as too soft. In Hull, three boys who stole a cancer sufferer’s bike were told to take part in a charity run. In Lancashire, an 11-year-old who stole swan’s eggs had to ‘learn more about wildlife’. Some victims have also questioned the measures. Deaf student Kirsty Mills agreed to restorative justice after a 13-year-old boy mocked her and pelted her home with eggs. Police took the yob to her home near Salford to apologise, but Kirsty, 21, said: ‘He didn’t give a damn. He was smirking. I still have to get a lift to university rather than catch the bus so I can avoid him.’ A spokesman for charity the Restorative Justice Council said: ‘The scheme has been shown to reduce reoffending by 14 per cent, and four out of five victims would recommend it.’","Supporters say restorative justice is a good way to treat first offenders .

"A headmaster brought in to transform a failing school began an affair within weeks with a married secretary who worked there, an employment tribunal heard. Mark Stenton had sex with mother-of-three Angela Honeywell at the school where her children were pupils, the hearing was told. She left her husband Chris, a carpet fitter, and set up home with Mr Stenton, but ended the affair three months later to give her five-year marriage another go. Mark Stenton (right) had sex at his school with married secretary, Angela Honeywell (pictured left with her husband Chris) who lived in fear of the headteacher's controlling nature, an employment tribunal heard . An enraged Mr Stenton went to her home . where he kicked in her front door and was ordered to leave by police. He also sent a text threatening suicide to Mrs Honeywell's 14-year-old . daughter Amy. Education chiefs and school governors . investigated and Mr Stenton was allowed to keep his £85,000-a-year job, . despite protests from some parents. But Mrs Honeywell left the school six . months after the fling ended and launched legal action, claiming she was . forced out of her admin post.

Elizabeth Cunningham, for Mr Stenton . and the school, told the hearing: 'This, from the beginning to the end, . was a consensual sexual relationship and the documentation refers to . shared sexual encounters taking place on school premises.

Mrs Honeywell, who is still with her . husband, told the tribunal she had lived in fear of the head and his . 'controlling nature' after their romance ended. She said: 'I was just so . scared of being in contact with him in any way. 'People would joke about me and make . snide comments. I had seen members of staff at Aldi glare and look at me . as if I was a piece of dirt, and I was so ill after that I thought . there was no way I could go back.' Mrs Honeywell signed off sick from her job in November 2011, a month after ending her affair. She claimed she was forced to give a . £1,000 interview to a magazine because Mr Stenton had left her . penniless. She said: 'He'd taken every penny I had and it was the only . way I could pay my mortgage. I was overdrawn for the first time in my . life. 'What I had left I gave to my children, which I know isn't much . consolation but they'd had a rough time. That is what I regret most. 'I was so ill I went down to six stone in weight.

"Since the age of 11 Louise Lidington had dreamt of a marriage day with all the traditional vows. But only hours before she was due to tie the knot, her hopes were shattered...when a registrar ruled the words ‘to have and to hold, in sickness and in health’ were too religious for their civil ceremony. The 39-year-old and her new husband Gary, 43, had instead to say ‘hold and have’ and ‘in sickness and when we are well’. Gary and Louise Lidington were told by the registrar that the wording of their wedding vows was too religious . They were told the traditional vows were too Christian because of their roots in the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Yet a minor tweak of the wording satisfied the officials. Mrs Lidington found the process so ridiculous she burst into a fit of giggles during the ceremony at Wilton’s Music Hall, a historic Victorian theatre in the East End of London. Her husband, who is a barrister, stumbled over his new lines. ‘The vows are so important,’ said Mrs Lidington. ‘They have just stood the test of time, they sound like poetry, they flow beautifully and they are just the form of words that you expect at a wedding. Ever since I was 11 I just imagined that they would be the words I would use when I married my husband. ‘It just seems ridiculous that words which don’t mention religion could be so problematic.’ There is much confusion surrounding the law on civil weddings. The 1949 Marriage Act states that ‘no religious service shall be used at any marriage solemnised in the presence of a superintendent registrar’. Eight years ago, however, the rules were relaxed to allow a limited amount of material that makes reference to religion – even the Robbie Williams song Angels. Stunning venue: Mr and Mrs Lidington married at Wilton's Music Hall in London's East End on Saturday . It is now for register offices to interpret the law as they see fit. The couple had spent months arranging their wedding and they believed they had agreed on the content of their vows at a meeting with Tower Hamlets registrars in February. On the afternoon before the ceremony, however, an official told Mrs Lidington she could not legally get married without a change of wording. ‘The registrar said she would not be able to marry us with these words and could I rewrite them over the phone,’ said the PR executive. ‘I just thought I can’t be rude, I can’t be offensive, because I have got to stand in front of her tomorrow and pledge my life to my husband.’ During his speech later on in the evening, Mr Lidington read out his original vows to his new wife. ‘Taking his lead, during my speech I said the words to him that we had originally chosen,’ Mrs Lidington said. ‘It was incredibly romantic and got a standing ovation from our guests.’ Tower Hamlets said its officials feared the original vows breached ‘the relevant legality process’. A spokesman added: ‘We apologise for the short notice that Mr and Mrs Lidington received regarding changes to their chosen vows. ‘We worked closely with the couple to ensure the vows they exchanged on their special day were as close as possible to those initially chosen by them.’","Gary and Louise Lidington were told their chosen vows were 'too religious'

"An angry punter punched a woman cashier at a bookies - just because he had lost a 50p bet that would have made him just £1.30, a court heard today. John Eamer, 29, stood to win the tiny amount when he bet that Germany would beat Portugal by at least 2-0 in their Euro 2012 clash. But after Portugal lost 1-0 he lashed out in rage across the counter of the Ladbroke’s betting shop in Gloucester on Sunday June 10. Thug: John Eamer, who punched a woman cashier at a bookies, outside Cheltenham Magistrate's Court (left) and at the scene of the crime . This is the barbaric moment John Eamer, from Gloucester, punched a woman cashier in the face after being told he hadn't won his bet . The attack on the shocked cashier was . captured on CCTV and when images of the incident were released by . police, Eamer, of Gloucester, was arrested. Eamer pleaded guilty to assaulting cashier Leanne Vallis by beating when he appeared at Cheltenham Magistrates Court today. Sharon Jamaa, prosecuting, said Eamer . had gone in to the bookies to claim what he thought was a winning . ticket where he had bet 50p and would win £1.30. 'He spoke to the cashier and presented his slip but he was told that he had not won,' she went on. 'The cashier made a computer check on . the handicap bet in which Germany had to win by more than one clear . goal and explained why Eamer was not a winner. 'Eamer became aggressive and began to . shout and swear and he was asked to leave. Without warning, he lunged . over the counter and punched Ms Vallis twice in the face causing . swelling and bruising.' The attack happened in a branch of Ladbrokes, on Southgate Street in Gloucester . In a victim statement Leanne Vallis said in 14 years working in the bookmakers, nothing like it had never happened before. 'I was very upset and scared. It was so ridiculous over such a small bet,' she said. Defending, Gemma Bond told the bench it had been an act of frustration. 'He bets regularly and knows what bets are needed to make winnings. He thought that the cashier was midleading him,' she said. The magistrates adjourned the case . for a probation service report on Eamer. They adjourned sentence till a . later date and granted him bail. A spokesman for Ladbrokes said: 'If . the shop doesn’t have a screen, it’s usually a sign that it is generally . quite safe and has few security incidents.' The company stressed that attacks in its betting shops remained extremely rare. The Ladbrokes spokesman said: . 'Incidents like this are always distressing for those involved but we . have excellent security procedures and the best CCTV in the business, . the images from which we are using to assist the police with their . enquiries.'","John Eamer, 29, stood to win tiny amount when he bet on Euro 2012 match .

"Junior was 'a kind, ambitious, humble, reliable, caring, friendly boy' his mother said . A girl of 14 who ordered a teenager to be stabbed for being ‘disrespectful’ was found guilty of manslaughter yesterday. The teenager said 15-year-old Junior Nkwelle ‘should be punished’ following a row over a game of football and he died after her 16-year-old boyfriend thrust a carving knife once into his chest. Both were cleared of murder by a jury at the Old Bailey yesterday, but they are facing long prison terms after being  found guilty of manslaughter. Junior’s mother, Stella Muma, collapsed in tears after the verdicts and had to be comforted by friends and relatives. She said afterwards: ‘All he wanted to do was play football with his friends and be left alone. He certainly didn’t deserve to have his young, innocent life taken away.’ The court heard how Junior lost his life following a ‘trivial’ argument as he played football with friends on a patch of grass near his home in Brixton, South London. The girl claimed Junior had insulted her during the row, which broke out after she walked across the middle of the pitch with her friends. She then called her boyfriend, who is now 17, and ordered him to ‘teach Junior a lesson’, the court was told. Witnesses said they heard the girl boasting that she had arranged for someone to stab the teenager and she later went home to fetch a kitchen knife. When her boyfriend arrived on the scene, he was handed the blade and used it to stab Junior once, piercing his heart and lung. The youngster collapsed yards from his housing estate home in September last year and was pronounced dead an hour later. Prosecutor Jonathan Turner QC said the argument ‘was stupid  and trivial and completely unnecessary’. ‘It was loud enough to be heard by neighbours,’ he added. ‘Words were said, voices were raised and threats were made. ‘She thought that Junior had insulted . her or been less than respectful to her. She was very angry and . determined that he should be punished – indeed stabbed – to put things . right. ‘She called up her boyfriend and was heard to tell Junior that she had arranged for somebody to come and stab him.’ The girl had been angry and determined that Junior should be punished to put things right, the Old Bailey heard . Mr Turner added: ‘He (the defendant) was encouraged and requested by her to come and do this. Indeed, to use an old-fashioned phrase, was set up by her to do this.’ The 17-year-old killer, from Herne Hill, South London, claimed he was acting as a peacemaker and knifed Junior in self-defence. Both he and the girl, from Brixton, were given anonymity during the trial. Judge Richard Hone will decide whether to reveal their identities when they are sentenced on April 5. Mrs Muma said she is still haunted by visions of her dying son. She added: ‘It makes me feel so angry. It happened so quickly and so close to our home. ‘I didn’t even know what was going on and I had no chance to help, or see him and say goodbye and tell him how much I love him because by the time I got to him my poor child had bled to death. 'I wake every day and see where my boy was killed, the vision of him lying on the floor wounded, breathless, motionless, and bleeding as the paramedics tried to save him, a horrific vision that is engraved in my mind. ‘There have been many days I can’t face even going outside as the reminder of what has happened is too painful. ‘I always thought my boys would have to bury me one day, not this way around.’ Detective Chief Inspector Charles King, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ‘The death of Junior Nkwelle illustrates the terrible consequences of what appears to be the casual acceptance that knives have a part to play in minor disputes between young people in some parts of our community.’","Girl called her boyfriend to a housing estate to kill Junior Nkwelle .

"A teenager from the Wirral, Merseyside, has been arrested 133 times, making him one of the region's most prolific criminals. File picture . A 15-year-old boy has been arrested 133 times, making him one of Britain's most prolific criminals. The teenage crime-wave committed all the offences close to his home on the Wirral, near Liverpool, and has so far been convicted a total of 28 times. It is not known what the boy's crimes were. Just three other hardened criminals in the Merseyside area have committed more offences, including a 40 year old man who has been arrested 176 times and convicted of 65 offences. The arrest figures were unveiled after a request under the Freedom of Information Act. Southport Liberal Democrat John Pugh says more action is needed to stem the tide of re-offending. He said: 'These people are neither learning nor caring but are costing society dearly. 'We can’t go on pretending that normal law enforcement works with these characters.' Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, added: 'Prison is the only sure way to protect the public from hardened criminals.' The figures obtained by the Daily Express also revealed that a thief who has been in court an average of three times a year since 1959 was jailed for clocking up his 334th crime in November.

"Spared jail: Killer Alison Richardson, 46, arriving at court earlier in her trial . A woman who killed her boyfriend and then went on to abuse vulnerable patients after she was employed as a health care assistant has escaped jail. Alison Richardson - who jailed for manslaughter after stabbing her boyfriend to death in 1993 - was handed a suspended sentence after being caught on CCTV abusing a patient at The Priory hospital in Middleton St George, near Darlington. The 46-year-old, who fully disclosed her conviction when she was hired, jammed a bin onto a female patient’s head following a ‘tussle’. She later put her hands around the same patient’s throat in a ‘throttling position’, shaking her and poking her in the ribs. Other patients and members of staff were present during both assaults. Detective Constable Fiona Laws said: 'She denied everything in formal interviews, never showed any remorse and never admitted any wrong-doing. 'She was in a position of trust at the hospital, working alongside other members of staff caring for vulnerable patients. 'The assaults represented a loss of control and abuse of that trust.' Graham Hunsley, mitigating, described Richardson’s actions as horseplay gone too far, saying they reflected a lack of training at the private hospital. He asked District Judge Andrew Meachin to show leniency on the basis that the assaults were without malice. Judge Meachin, sentencing Richardson at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates Court, repeatedly expressed astonishment that somebody with Richardson’s background was allowed to work with vulnerable people and questioned whether the hospital had been investigated as a result. Describing the situation as ‘disturbing’, he said: 'This young lady has a certain conviction and has ended up in a position of carer, working one to one with a group of teenagers with certain difficulties. 'She went too far and was given certain leeway in doing so. The incidents were a serious breach of trust and she was in a position she shouldn’t have been in.' Richardson, who now lives in Hull, previously admitted two counts of assault by beating. Five other charges were dropped. Hospital: Richardson worked at The Priory in Darlington, pictured before it was put under new management . Sentencing her to four months imprisonment for each offence, suspended for 12 months, the judge said: 'You came to believe you could act in a certain way with these people. 'The term play fighting has been used and that is unbelievable, you went far too far and there was an element of humiliation.' Following the events, the hospital was warned by the Care Quality Commission for putting patients at significant risk’ by failing to conduct risk assessments relating to the suitability of employees to work with vulnerable people. A spokesman from The Priory said the decision to employ Richardson was taken by previous owners Affinity Healthcare. She said: 'The decision to employ this person and change her role was taken under the previous ownership of the hospital. Sentence: Alison Richards was given the suspended sentence at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court. The judge said he was surprised she had ever been employed caring for the vulnerable . 'This has been dealt with, and under the new senior management at the hospital a robust review has been undertaken. 'The hospital has apologised to the victim of this offence. It has robust procedures, including routine CCTV recordings, in place to safeguard patients and staff alike. 'In this isolated incident, our CCTV footage indicated unacceptable behaviour which acted as crucial evidence in this matter. 'We were therefore able to take immediate and vigorous action to protect patients by referring the matter to the Police, suspending and then dismissing the employee involved.'","Alison Richardson, 46, was sent to prison for killing her boyfriend in 1993 .

"A 14-year-old boy arrested for posting a pornographic video of himself and a schoolgirl on Facebook has today been bragging about his new-found notoriety on Twitter. The unnamed teen was pictured smirking and holding up the front page of a local newspaper which featured his story under the headline: 'School kids in sex video'. His clip - which features a 14-year-old girl consensually performing a sex act - was said to have been in 'common circulation' among pupils before being removed. 'Proud': the unnamed 14-year-old has apparently been boasting of his actions, which involved filming a girl, 14, performing a sex act on him . Police arrested the boy and he was given a final warning for making and distributing an indecent video - which will stay on his record for six years. Disgusted parents slammed the teen’s behaviour after the picture of him holding the Gloucester Citizen newspaper was tweeted among pupils. He has been 'bragging' about his actions and attained 'cult status' among some male pupils, according to one parent. The anonymous parent added: 'This incident has been the subject of much tweeting among my son’s peers. 'When it first hit Twitter a couple of weeks ago I read reams of banter between the boy and girl involved, and their friends. 'I find it hard to fathom that he was apparently allowed access to Twitter, Facebook or any other social media site to brag about his new-found ""fame""'. Viewed: Scores of children were thought to have seen the film . The parent added: 'Most - predominately girls - have posted that they are disgusted by his actions. 'Inevitably, . however, he has also attained some kind of cult status, which, as is . evident from the picture posted on Twitter of him holding up a copy of . yesterday’s Citizen, he seems to be revelling in. 'Sadly, it would appear that arrest and a police warning have done nothing to teach this young man a lesson. 'I . feel desperately sorry for the young girl involved who, according to . her tweets, was not aware that he was filming her, or that he intended . to put the footage on Facebook. 'This boy has humiliated her and her family on an absolutely immense scale.' The . boy, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was arrested in connection with . making and distributing an indecent video on Facebook and has been given . a final warning by police. It was claimed the girl in the clip is from the nearby Forest of Dean but did not attend the same school. Pupils at St Peter's High School in Gloucestershire - which is not involved in the incident - have seen the video, warned headmaster Lawrence Montagu . As Gloucestershire Police warn, the danger of posting images and videos online is that they can then be distributed freely and without control . The video came to light after Lawrence Montagu, headteacher at St Peter’s High School, informed parents in a school newsletter. He . wrote: 'I am led to believe that this video involves young people from . schools in Gloucestershire but not, I emphasise, St Peter’s. 'However, . I know that the video has been viewed by students in St Peter’s and I . have spoken to the school about the lack of dignity and self-respect . people have who allow themselves to be portrayed in such a way. 'It is very sad that our young people are exposed to such pornography, but it is one of the evils of modern technology. 'We . simply have to continue educating the young to reap the benefits that . modern technology offers but not to fall into the trap of misusing it.'

"Co-accused: Mairead Philpott, left, allegedly had an abortion because the baby was fathered by a man who wasn't her husband Michael, right . A mother jointly accused of killing her six children in a house fire had an abortion after falling pregnant with another man's baby, a court heard today. Mairead Philpott, 31, is jointly charged with her husband Michael, 56, of starting a house fire which killed six of their young children as they slept in their beds. Mrs Philpott's colleague Claire Tyler today told the court how the mother had taken time off work at the Royal Derby Hospital in 2011 to see her doctor about having a termination. She told the court Mrs Philpott was pregnant with another man's child after having sex with him in front of her husband. Shaun Smith QC, Mrs Philpott’s barrister, asked Ms Tyler: 'It’s the case, isn’t it, that she had had sex with another man and the child was a result of that? 'And that was when Mick was there, that she had had sex with another man?' 'Yes,' Ms Tyler replied. Ms Tyler added that Mrs Philpott was bubbly and very talkative during her work as a hospital cleaner, but her personality would change when her husband picked her up from work and she became very subdued. 'She loved her job,' she said. 'She saw it as a break to get away from her home life and children.' As soon as her husband would pick her up at work and she got into the van, her mood would change 'instantly', Ms Tyler said, and she would become subdued and even agitated. Accused: Mairead Philpott and her husband Michael, pictured with the six children who died in the house fire, are both accused of manslaughter . She also told how she overheard Mr Philpott saying someone being interviewed by police was 'going to drop us in it'. Nottingham Crown Court heard how Mr . Philpott allegedly made the comments on the phone days after the house . fire in Derby last May. Ms Tyler told jurors she heard his side of the conversation. She said: 'I heard him say he has not got the story right.' Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked her: 'When he said he has not got the story right, did he say what the consequence was going to be?' 'He’s going to drop us in it,' she replied. 'He has not got the story right. He’s going to drop either us or me in it. You heard him say that on the phone?' Mr Latham asked. She replied: 'Yes.' On trial: Michael Philpott (left), his wife Mairead (centre) and defendant Paul Mosley (right) have been accused of starting the fire which killed the children . In cross-examination, Anthony Orchard QC, defending Philpott, suggested to Ms Tyler that she only heard one side of the conversation, that she did not know who Philpott was talking about, she had not made any notes of what exactly he had said, and that the man he was said to be talking about had nothing to do with this case. Ms Tyler, who had known Mairead Philpott for around seven years when they worked together as hospital cleaners, agreed with Mr Orchard’s submission. She was giving evidence at the trial in which Philpott and his 31-year-old wife are accused of the manslaughter of their six children. A third defendant, 46-year-old Paul Mosley, also stands accused of the same charges. Ms Tyler also admitted Mrs Philpott had told her about her triangular relationship at home. Mrs Philpott and her husband lived at the property in Victory Road with Lisa Willis, 29, who was Philpott's mistress. Mick and Mairead Philpott, pictured with five of the six children who died in the house fire. The other identities have been obscured for legal reasons . A total of 11 children also lived there - six were those of Mr and Mrs Philpott, four were Miss Willis's who were fathered by Philpott, and one child was Miss Willis's from a previous relationship. Ms Tyler said Mrs Philpott told her about when Miss Willis left the family home with her five children in February and described the effect it was having. 'She was getting blamed for Lisa going,' she said. 'Blamed by?' Mr Latham asked. 'Her husband,' Ms Tyler answered. Jade, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13, all perished after a fire which engulfed their home in Victory Road, Allenton, Derby, in the early hours of May 11 last year. All three defendants have denied the charges. Jade Philpott, 10 . Jayden Philpott, 5 . John Philpott, 9 . Jack Philpott, 8 . Jesse Philpott, 6 . Duwayne Philpott, 13 .

"If Boris bikes aren't enough exercise, a London design firm has proposed a new way for London commuters to get to work - by swimming. The 'Lidoline' would create a special commuter lane in Regent's Canal, which spans London. The idea, developed by design firm Y/N, has already won second prize in a prestigious contest organised by the Mayor of London, and the firm now hopes to attract funding to make the project a reality. The lidoline, created by design firm Y/N, would allow commuters to swim to work across London. During the winter a thin membrane would be placed along the route, allowing it to freeze easily and making it safe to ice skate one. 'We thought that another new open space was a little redundant - the . problem is those spaces are underused,' said David Lomax of Y/N Studios, . which developed the idea. 'We would create a network to link those areas together. 'The obvious thing was the Regents Canal - it runs through London, but is sporadically used, and is rarely used in its entirety. 'Creating a commuting network would allow people to reuse the canal, and they could be taken to work while highlighting underused places of London.' The idea came second to a scheme to  transform the disused . 'Mail Rail' tunnel under Oxford Street in London into an urban mushroom . garden lit at street level by sculptural glass-fibre mushrooms in a recent Landscape Institute/Mayor of . London/Garden Museum competition. The route would stretch from Little Venice to Limehouse Basin . Stations along the route could also be used as open air cinemas in the evening, the team behind the lidoline claim. The judging panel, which included Joshua David and Robert Hammond, . co-founders of New York’s High Line, Dr Penelope Curtis, Director of . Tate Britain, Mark Brearley, Head of Design for London, and leading . landscape architects Kim Wilkie and Jo Gibbons also selected a runner-up . and three highly commended designs from the 170 entries. However, the team behind the Lidoline said they are hopeful it could still happen. 'We would love to take it further if we can find the energy and the funding. 'It's sensibly ambitious, there are plans for a floating pool in US, and it would be great if we could even realise a short stretch of it.' Larger pools could also be created along the route to boost swimming across London. Grandstands and viewing areas could be built for swimming contests and cinema showings.","The Lidoline would follow the route of Regent's Canal, with 'stations' used as open air cinemas in the evening .

"Three female tourists were hit in the face and head with a hammer in a brutal attack at one of London’s biggest and busiest hotels just yards from busy Oxford Street. One of the women is in a critical but stable condition after the assault in a room at the Four Star Cumberland Hotel in the early hours of yesterday morning. The women, understood to be sisters from the United Arab Emirates, were staying at the hotel with children as young as seven-years-old in adjoining rooms when they were attacked. Four stars: The Cumberland Hotel in London, where the hammer attack on three women in their thirties took place . Botched burglary: Police believe the suspect entered a room on the seventh floor where the three women were staying with three children in adjoining rooms (stock image of a Cumberland Hotel room) Officers today said the thief gained access to their rooms after one of the women left her door unlocked. He then attacked the first women before going into the adjoining room through a connecting door where he beat the other two women shortly before 2am on Sunday morning. One of the women is in critical condition but the other two have non-life threatening injuries. Detective Supterintendent Carl Mehta said that they are looking for a white male who maybe have been 'covered in blood' when he fled the hotel during the early hours of Sunday morning. He revealed that police are now examining CCTV from Oxford St in a bid to reconstruct the family's movements and to see if they were followed. Det Supt Mehta said that the room, on the seventh floor of the hotel, was deliberately left unlocked by the occupants as they had other family members staying at the hotel. Three women and three children shared the two rooms which had an adjoining door. Mr Mehta said: 'It was a vicious attack. We will be putting together the moments preceding the attack in the hotel to establish what happened. 'We are keeping an open mind at this early stage but theft does appear to be the motive. 'We are relatively comfortable there was no breach of hotel security and the door had been left unlocked. 'There is no evidence of the key being stolen and the family had deliberately left the door open. 'He went into the woman's room and attacked the woman. The children were not disturbed or harmed. The man left behind the hammer.' Police are putting together CCTV images in an attempt to work out what happened before the attack. 'I don't know if he followed them but they had been shopping on Saturday in major retail places like Oxford Street. They are clearly a wealthy family. 'It's an unusual attack in London and it's unprecedented.' Scene: One of the women is in a critical but stable condition after the assault at the Cumberland Hotel near Oxford Street in London . Manhunt: Police are appealing for any witnesses of the incident on Sunday morning at the Cumberland Hotel, pictured, to come forward . The family arrived in London separately between the 3rd and 5th of this month. The children are aged between seven and 12-years-old. Det Supt Mehta added: 'The children remain unharmed and are being looked after by other family members. 'There are other members of family in the UK and family liaison officers are with them giving them support and information as it arrived. 'We are conducting a detailed forensic investigation looking at the scene and the CCTV images from the hotel and surrounding area. 'I am making a desperate appeal for witnesses who saw a single white male leaving the hotel possibly covered in blood. 'It's a large London hotel and lots of people were around that time of the morning. It's extraordinarily rare and there's no indication that this type of incident had taken place previously.' Hotel guests have described horrifying scenes following the attack with one man revealing how he saw a woman in blood stained pyjamas screaming 'he attacked me, he attacked me' running down the corridor. Faleh Al Rashidi, a media executive from Kuwait who is staying at The Cumberland hotel on his honeymoon, said the woman screamed before collapsing in the corridor outside his room. The 28-year-old said the woman was dressed in black pyjama bottoms and a light blue dress spattered with blood. Mr Al Rashidi said: 'I think she had run down from the seventh floor. We were staying on the first floor. 'She was screaming so loudly ""he . attacked me, he attacked me, help me, help me"" then she fell in the . floor and a man came to help her. 'She . was wearing black pyjama bottoms and a light blue dress on top which . had blood on it. She was shaking uncontrollably. I think she was about . 25-years-old. 'I'm not sure she was attacked, I think she was a witness. I don't feel safe here after seeing that.' Another guest, Hasan Mohamed who is also from the UAE, was woken up by the screaming at about 1.45am. The 28-year-old businessman said: 'She was screaming that she regretted coming to London, she was shouting about what had happened to her sisters. She said two of her sisters' heads were bleeding. 'I was very afraid - we didn't see her we just heard her screaming. It was very loud and woke us both up.' The women, who are in their thirties, had travelled to London for a shopping spree from their home in the United Arab Emirates . Scotland Yard has launched a nationwide manhunt to trace the attacker, who was not a guest at the hotel. Detective . Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said: 'This was an unusually violent . attack on three women and I am very keen to speak with anyone who was in . or around the hotel between 1am and 2am on Sunday morning. 'Did you see or hear anything that could be of use to my officers? If so, we would like to hear from you as soon as possible.' At . this stage, police are retaining an open mind regarding the motive for . the attack. One line of inquiry is that the assault came after a bungled . robbery by an opportunist thief. Detectives . have retrieved CCTV footage and are questioning staff and other guests. A spokesman for the hotel said everything has returned to normal at the . Cumberland following the incident. He said: ‘It’s an ongoing investigation . and we are helping police with their inquiries in order to get this . sorted as soon as possible.’ There have been no arrests following the incident. A spokeswoman for London Ambulance Service said: 'We were called to reports of an assault at Great Cumberland Place. 'We sent a responder in a car and three ambulance crews. Staff treated three patients, all women, and two were reported to be in their 30s. 'All patients were taken as priorities to hospital.' The area surrounding the hotel, near Marble Arch, is popular with tourists from the Middle East. Prices for a night at the 1,000-room Cumberland Hotel, which also has a Jimi Hendrix suite as the musician gave his last ever interview there in 1970, range from £142 for a single room to £316 for the junior king suite with breakfast and dinner included. The hotel’s website boasts of its ‘cutting edge contemporary design’ in the heart of London ‘where Oxford Street meets Park Lane’. It adds: ‘The spectacular, spacious lobby creates a striking first impression with contemporary, original art and lighting. 'Every feature is beautifully considered at this iconic Hyde Park hotel, from the unique Jimi Hendrix Suite to London’s finest restaurants and bars.’ Mike DeNoma, CEO of the Guoman Hotels group, said: 'We are very concerned for their family and our employees. We are doing everything we can to assist the police with their enquiries. 'We just don't know at this stage how it happened.'","Assault happened at Cumberland Hotel just yards from Oxford Street .

"Megyn Kelly has sparked a new round of backlash after defending her on-air comments about Santa's 'verifiably' white skin - though she did admit her assertion that Jesus was also Caucasian is 'far from settled.' Kelly, 43, took a sick day Thursday but returned last night in full force to hit back at her critics who ridiculed her for declaring that 'Santa is white,' and that Jesus was also a white man on her Fox Network show. The comments came during a debate about a Slate article written by Aisha Harris who suggested a more inclusive festive icon - she proposed a penguin - become a new symbol of Christmas cheer for children. Scroll down for video . Responding: Kelly dedicated much of her show to defending Wednesday's much derided segment about the color of Santa's skin . Kelly devoted a significant portion of Friday's The Kelly File to defending herself and her comments, saying that the real debate - whether a more inclusive Santa should be created - was lost due to the storm of controversy. She claimed that the segment was intended as a lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek discussion but that the humor was lost on some of her detractors. 'Humor is part of what we try to bring to the show. Sometimes that's lost on the humorless.' Kelly's aggressive stance only added fuel to the fire Saturday. Journalist David Badash penned a column for his news and opinion site The New Civil Rights Movement, attacking Kelly's comment about Jesus' race not being a settled matter. ‘Actually, it really is settled. But just like climate change, even if perhaps one per cent of the world’s population disagrees, a settled fact is “far from settled” at Fox News,’ he wrote. The founder of the online journal also took issue with the anchor's claim that her assertions were tongue-in-cheek. 'Perhaps all of Fox News is really just a joke?' he wrote in his Saturday column. Letter to Santa: MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry read her open letter to St Nick on her show, saying that it is an indication of how broad America's race and class divide is that some cannot envision him as anything but white . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . Meanwhile, MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry spent a portion of her program Saturday addressing the Santa-gate. In an open letter to Kris Kringle himself, Harris-Perry said that it is an indication of how broad America’s race and class divide is that some cannot envision St Nick being anything but white, Mediaite reported. ‘I know it’s a busy time of year, but we need to settle a little debate that’s emerged in American media asking, “Are you white? Are you black? When you come in from the North Pole, do you have a legal visa or are you undocumented?”’ Harris-Perry asked. ‘Can you find a kid if he lives in an apartment building not a house without a chimney? Can you find her in a homeless shelter?’ She continued. ‘Why do you leave so many more trees under the big trees in the wealthy neighborhood and so few under the trees in the poor communities?’ The TV presenter said that in her mixed race family, it was important to share with children depictions of role models and inspirational figures who remind them of themselves. ‘If we cannot imagine you as racially different from ourselves, it’s because our minds are stunted by a history that still can’t fathom benevolence, and kindness, and intimacy in the bodies of those who are not like us,’ Harris-Perry said. ‘If we still doubt that you can embody every possibility of racial being, it is because we do not yet believe that every racial body is capable of making our sugar plum dreams come true.’ The anchor concluded by saying that if Americans cannot even imagine Santa outside a racial context, it should not surprise anyone that a racial divide still exists in the U.S. On Wednesday, Kelly said on the show that just because Santa's supposed white race makes some people, including Slate columnist Aisha Harris, uncomfortable, it does not mean that it has to change. Controversy: Kelly made her divisive comments on her show on Wednesday during a discussion with a panel of speakers . 'Jesus was a white man, too. It's like . we have, he's a historical figure that's a verifiable fact, as is . Santa, I just want kids to know that. How do you revise it in the middle . of the legacy in the story and change Santa from white to black?' In fact, what Harris' article suggested was neither a black nor a white Santa, but a black-and-white bird - a festive penguin. To that suggestion, Kelly said Harris had 'gone off the rails.' When . another panelist suggests this would make all kids feel equally . welcome, she replied, 'No. No, it doesn't... It makes all birds feel . welcome.' Kelly said tonight that the reaction to the segment on her show would be funny if 'it were not so telling about our society, in particular the knee-jerk instinct by so many to race-bait - and to assume the worst in people. Especially people employed by the very powerful Fox News channel.' She said that all she did was acknowledge that Santa is generally depicted as white - exactly as Harris did - and was unfairly accused of 'racial fear and loathing.' Kelly also played several clips of other networks discussing her segment - she has been lampooned by the likes of Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Historical figure: Contrary to Kelly's statements, Saint Nicholas was from modern Turkey and wouldn't have born much resemblance to rosy-cheeked Santa Claus . 'The fact that an off-hand jest I made . during a segment about whether Santa should be replaced by a penguin . has now become a national firestorm says two things,' Kelly said. 'Race . is still an incredibly volatile issue in this country, and Fox News, and . yours truly, are big targets for many people.' The comments Kelly made about Santa weren't the only ones to be met with ridicule. 'I . also did say Jesus was white. As I've learned in the past two days, . that is far from settled,' was all Kelly said about her statements . pertaining to Jesus' skin color.

Classic Santa Claus: As a fictitious representation of a European Saint Nicholas - it is fair to assume that Santa Claus was white . The controversy was addressed by Reza Aslan, a scholar of religions and author of the recent bestseller Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. An expert, Aslan said that 'as a Galilean, he would have been what is referred to as a Palestinian Jew. He would look the way that the average Palestinian would look today. So that would mean dark features, hairy, probably a longer nose, black hair,' said Aslan to the Washington Post. Jamelle Bouie writing in the Daily Beast was even harder on Kelly. 'Kelly’s not wrong to say that Santa Claus is European - that’s his heritage. 'But there’s little chance that Jesus is white, and asserting otherwise is just as ludicrous as the declaration - made by some Christians - that Jesus spoke the early modern English of the King James Bible. 'At best, the assertion of Jesus’s whiteness reflects ignorance. At worst, it’s a sign of racial prejudice.'","Megyn Kelly was a no-show for The Kelly File Thursday night .

"A 22-year-old who allegedly gunned down his parents and his brother at their home was captured by police yesterday after a day-long manhunt. Trey Eric Sesler, an online animation enthusiast and critic from Texas, is believed to have had a high-powered weapon on him and body armour when he was arrested on Tuesday night. The bodies of his parents and brother were discovered around 1pm at their Houston home after police received a call from concerned relatives. Scroll down for video . Suspected killer: A family member described Sesler as 'peculiar' but he has no criminal record and was an amine enthusiast who posted reviews online . Crime scene: The bodies of Sesler's parents and brother were discovered around 1pm at their Houston home after police received a call from concerned relatives . Lawton Ray Sesler Jr, 58, his wife . Rhonda Wyse Sesler, 57, and their son, Mark Alan Sesler, 26, were found . at the home with multiple fatal gunshot wounds from a high-powered rifle. Someone reported gunshots coming from the home on Monday evening but when police arrived they discovered nothing. Trey Sesler, 22, was arrested for allegedly shooting dead his parents and brother on a gun rampage at their home . Waller County Sheriff Glenn Smith said: 'This was a scene that had a lot of violence. The house was ransacked. 'Evidence was obtained and it was pretty . obvious the connection of the other brother and son to these people.' Trey . Sesler has no criminal record, according to the Houston Chronicle. Waller Police Chief Phil Rehak said: 'The best way for me to describe the residence is it looked like a war zone – a tremendous amount of damage inside the residence, the crime scene was not contained to one area of the residence.

"A former LA gang member who has been listed as one of the LAPD's most-wanted fugitives for the last 12 years has finally been arrested, after police tracked him down using Facebook. Eduardo Rodriguez, 35, who was wanted in connection to four 2003 murders, was apprehended on Thursday after a detective  on light duty for an injury noticed him in photos uploaded to Facebook by other active gang members. Rodriguez had been living under the alias Juan Carlos Campos Gamino for five years working as a carpenter and even had a fiancee, who did not know about his hidden life. According to The Los Angeles Times, he was second in command to the Tooner Ville Rifa 13 gang, run by Timothy McGhee. Finally captured: Eduardo Rodriguez, 35, who was wanted in connection to four 2003 murders, was apprehended on Thursday after a detective who was on light duty due to an injury noticed him in photos uploaded to Facebook by other active gang members . McGhee was sentenced to death in 2009 for his role in three separate homicides, however is alleged to have been responsible for at least 12 others between 1997 and 2001. Rodriguez, also known as Juan Carlos Campos Gamino, disappeared soon after he was indicted in 2003 on four counts of homicide and two counts of attempted homicide. He was charged with the 2001 shooting death of Margie Mendoza, 26, a mother of three who was gunned down in Atwater Village while sitting in her boyfriend’s car. His other charges are unclear, but are somehow related to Mendoza. Following an 11-year manhunt, a detective in Glendale got a break in the cold case last year. The cop, who was familiar with Toonerville gang members and their associates, spotted Rodriguez while trawling Facebook. Leader: Rodriguez was reportedly second in command of the Tooner Ville Rifa 13, run by Timothy McGhee (pictured), who was sentenced to death in 2009 for his role in three separate homicides . He traced the fugitive to a woman, who turned out to be his fiancee. Police tracked down the address of the woman and staked out her house. After Rodriguez was positively identified, U.S. marshals moved in. Rodriguez was captured in the 3500 block of Farnham Place in Riverside at about 6.30pm Thursday. 'You could see that moment when he knew what it was about and he just gave up,' U.S. Marshal's Service Deputy Laura Vega told The LA Times. 'He saw the cars, he gets his hands up ... he still had his (gang) tattoos.' Vega said Rodriguez's fiancee and her family were at home at the time of the arrest. It was clear they had no idea he was a fugitive. 'She seemed genuinely pretty shocked,' Vega told the paper. According to NBC Los Angeles, neighbors described Rodriguez seemed like 'a normal father-of-three'. However there is no further information on any children.

"Computer scientists have developed  a new type of software that not only detects and eradicates never-before-seen viruses and malware, but automatically repairs damage caused by them too. The software, named A3, then prevents a hacker ever infecting the computer again. It works with a virtual computer that emulates the operations of a specific machine and is designed to watch over the virtual machine’s operating system and applications. The software, called A3, then prevents a hacker (illustrated with a stock picture) ever infecting a computer again. It works with a virtual computer that emulates the operations of a specific machine and is designed to watch over the virtual machine’s operating system and applications . Eric Eide, Research Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah, explained that A3 is intended to protect servers and business computers that run on the Linux operating system, as well as military machines. In the future it could  be adapted for home laptops too. ‘A3 technologies could find their way into consumer products someday, which would help consumer devices protect themselves against fast-spreading malware or internal corruption of software components. But we haven’t tried those experiments yet,’ he said. The team, including Professor John Regehr, created ‘stackable debuggers’ that run on top of each other and look inside the virtual machine while it is running to search for any unusual behaviour. Unlike a normal virus scanner on a consumer PC, that compares a catalogue of known viruses to something that has infected the computer, A3 can detect new, unknown viruses or malware automatically by sensing that something unusual is occurring in the computer’s operation.

As well as boosting cyber security for military missions, A3 could be used by web services such as Amazon, which if attacked by a virus, could repair its service in minutes without having to take the servers down and stop customers from shopping. To demonstrate the power of the system, the researchers, together with Massachusetts-based defence contractor, Raytheon BBN, showed  officials from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) how their software copes with a software bug called Shellshock. Shellshock was a software vulnerability discovered last September that affected many web servers and most Apple laptops and desktops, which allowed a hacker to control a machine. Within the first 24 hours of the disclosure of Shellshock, security researchers reported that more than 17,000 attacks by hackers had been made with the bug. A3 is intended to protect servers and business computers that run on the Linux operating system, as well as military machines (illustrated by the briefing room of General David Petraeus in Mosul, Iraq). It could in the future be adapted for home laptops too . Military: The software could be used to provide extra protection for sensitive military machines. Business: A3 could be used by web services such as Amazon, which if attacked by a virus, could repair its service in minutes without having to take the servers down and stop customers from shopping. Consumers:  A3 could be adapted for home laptops to help consumer devices protect themselves against fast-spreading malware or internal corruption of software components. A3 discovered the Shellshock attack on a web server and repaired the damage in four minutes, Professor Eide said. The team also tested A3 successfully on another six pieces of malware. He said: ‘It is a pretty big deal that a computer system could automatically, and in a short amount of time, find an acceptable fix to a widespread and important security vulnerability.’ ‘It’s pretty cool when you can pick the ""Bug of the Week"" and it works.’ The team will work on a way of using A3 in cloud computing next.

"You can order a cup of coffee in hundreds of different way – and soon you could be able to personalise a pint of beer too. Engineers have developed a ‘barista-type experience’ for beer drinkers where a barman can adjust a gadget fitted to a beer tap to adjust the ‘hoppiness’ level on demand. The 'Hoppier' device means that new flavours of beer could be created by drinkers to suit their tastes. Scroll down for video . Engineers have developed a ‘barista-type experience’ for beer drinkers where a barman can adjust a gadget fitted to a beer tap to adjust the ‘hoppiness’ level on demand (pictured left and right) In recent years, there has been a big rise in the number of speciality beers available in Europe and a huge growth in the craft beer scene in the US. Engineers at Cambridge Consultants claim to have ‘transformed’ the brewing and dry-hopping process, which usually tales two weeks, to enable consumers to change the flavour of beer in seconds. ‘Essentially, we’re making an “espresso” of beer, said Edward Brunner, head of food and beverage systems at Cambridge Consultants. The beer is pumped at high pressure (nine bar) across natural hops (pictured) .This allows the flavour of the hops to be extracted very quickly .Drinkers can choose between different hops flavours . The 'espresso machine meets beer font' gadget is attached to a barrel of standard beer. The beer tap has an attachment on it that looks like it comes from a coffee machine. The beer is pumped at high pressure (nine bar) across natural hops. This allows the flavour of the hops to be extracted very quickly. Drinkers can choose between different hops flavours and intensities to personalise their beer. The gadget is currently a prototype. ‘We’ve taken our expertise in fluid technology and beverage systems, and transferred that knowledge between different industries – using some of the secrets of successful coffee machines to enable us to create personalised beer that is fresh and natural. ‘We knew, for example, that pressure is fundamental to extracting flavour in espresso machines – so part of our investigation was to see whether it does anything for beer. ‘As a result, we have speeded up the dry-hopping process – and, by adding extra hops at the point of dispense, their volatile aromas are as fresh and intense as possible.' The beer tap has an attachment similar to one seen on an espresso machine through which beer is pumped at high pressure. The liquid passes across hops to rapidly extract their flavour. In this way, the flavour of the beer can be changed. Mr Brunner added: 'The aroma of the finished pint can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the quantity of hops and by changing the type of hops used.’ He believes that the machine gives brands to stand out in a crowded marketplace. ‘It’s a way of building on the current trend of personalisation to create new experiences and add value for the consumer,’ he said. The scientists will demonstrate their personalised beer technology at the 3rd Annual Canadean Alcohol Innovation Congress, on December 2 in Kensington, London.

"The International Space Station (ISS) had to be ‘pushed’ out of the way of space debris earlier this week to prevent a potential impact. The piece of debris was thought to be a remnant of a Chinese spy satellite and may have been a lens cap or a cover. The ‘push’ was performed by Europe’s ATV-5 cargo ship and pushed the ISS about one mile (1.6km) higher. Nasa mission controllers in Texas have moved the ISS (shown) using the European ATV-5 cargo spacecraft (seen at the bottom middle of the picture) to avoid a collision. They increased the speed of the station by 16ft (5 meters) per second. This raised the height of the station by one mile (1.6km) The debris was due to come within seven-tenths of a mile to the station, which Nasa mission controllers in Texas felt was too close for comfort. To move the station they fired the thrusters on the ATV-5 (Automated Transfer Vehicle). This increased the speed of the station ever so slightly and raised it into a higher orbit, out of the orbital path of the debris. According to NasaSpaceFlight.com, this debris came from a Chinese spy satellite called Yaogan 12 and was possibly a lens cap or cover. The piece of debris was thought to originate from a Chinese spy satellite launched in November 2011 called Yaogan-12. While the exact purposes of the satellite are unknown, Chinese media often assert they are used for scientific experiments. In the West its believed they are based on a satellite platorm called Phoenix Eye-2 that is used for military purposes, according to NasaSpaceFlight.com. The debris was catalogued as #39372/2011-066G. While this may seem unintersting, the number at the end - 2011 - reveals that the piece of debris was shed by the satellite early in its life. This means it is something that it discarded soon after reaching orbit - and as it is a satellite with a camera ability, this might well have been a lens cap or cover. Moving the station - known as a Pre-determined Debris Avoidance Manouevre (PDAM) - is not entirely uncommon. There are hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris in orbit around Earth at pose a threat to the station. Most of this comes from a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007, when the country blew up one of its weather satellites on purpose. The incident was widely criticised and has resulted in a dangerous amount of debris orbiting Earth. Another infamous debris incident occurred when the American Iridium 33 satellite accidentally collided with the Russian Kosmos-2251 in 2009. This too released a large amount of debris into Earth orbit. There are a number of organisations that track junk that is orbiting Earth. If the chance of a piece hitting the station is one in 100,000, Nasa issues a ‘yellow warning’. This means the station needs to be moved, as happened recently, unless the move could affect the mission. Moving the station - known as a Debris Avoidance Manouevre (DAM) - is not entirely uncommon.There are hundreds of thousands of pieces of debris in orbit around Earth (illustration shown) that pose a threat to the station, so it must occasionally be moved even when a collision is rated as a possible risk . This picture shows just how damaging space debris can be. It was taken on a Space Shuttle servicing mission to Nasa's Solar Max Mission satellite in 1984. The hole could have been caused by a piece of space debris that was no bigger than a pea . If the chance of a collision is one in 10,000 Nasa issues a ‘red warning’, which means the station must be moved regardless of whether it could hamper the mission. And in very rare circumstances when a collision seems likely, the crew must prepare for an emergency evacuation. In March 2009 such an incident occurred, and the three astronauts on the station had to take cover in one of the Soyuz modules, which act as ‘lifeboats’. Had the station been hit, they would have had to detach and return to Earth. However the latest boost had an added bonus, as a pre-planned boost scheduled for a few weeks from now no longer needs to be completed. 'The PDAM was completed nominally, and the ISS is back in a nominal Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA),” said an ISS status update. 'Since the PDAM was executed , the reboost that was planned for later is no longer required, and will not be performed.'","Nasa mission controllers in Texas have moved the ISS to avoid a collision .

"Unicorns may only exist in fairy tales, but a deer with a single antler must have looked pretty convincing from a distance. The roe deer had a rare antler deformity that caused it to have a single cone-shaped bone protruding from the centre of its head. Shot by a hunter in Celje, Slovenia, the deer’s skeleton shows its startling deformity, which was probably caused by an injury when its antlers first started growing. The Slovenian 'unicorn': This roe deer's two antlers grew together into a single, unicorn-like protrusion. Shot by a hunter in Celje, Slovenia, the deer’s skeleton shows its startling deformity, which was probably caused by an injury when its antlers first started growing . Strangely-shaped antlers are common in deer and are often caused in this way, but scientist Boštjan Pokorny said the Slovenian ‘unicorn’s’ is unlike any other that he’s seen. Dr Pokorny, assistant director of the ecological research institute Erico Velenje, told National Geographic that male roe deer’s antlers are bilateral, and usually grow from two places on the skull called pedicles. ‘However, in the case of this very untypical and interesting buck, both pedicles, which should be separated, grew up together in one large pedicle.’ Strangely-shaped antlers are common in deer and are often caused by injuries when they are younger. A stock image of a male roe deer with standard antlers is pictured . The roe deer had a rare antler deformity that caused it to have a once antler growing skywards from the centre of its head. It was probably caused by an injury when its antlers first started growing. Antlers typically grow from two places on the skull called pedicles. It seems that they didn't separate as usual, but instead, antler grew from one large pedicle. The image of the deer's skeleton will appear in the December issue of National Geographic Slovenia magazine. Hunters are allowed to shoot the abundant deer species in Slovenia, and this one was thought to have been selected because of its age. Deer can lose an antler in lots of ways - including rutting in breeding season - and the one left over is called a ‘spike’. Dr Pokorny said it is unlikely that the hunter could have chosen the deer to kill because of its resemblance to a unicorn, because it would probably have looked as if it had an ordinary spike. While the deer may not have been magical, wildlife biologist Kip Adams said the cells that cause antlers to grow are ‘amazing’ and antlers are the most rapidly growing bones known in mammals. Antlers are shed every year and are made of bone. They differ from horns, which are permanent and made from keratin, just like fingernails and hair. Shot by a hunter in Celje, Slovenia (marked on the map) the deer’s skeleton shows its startling deformity . While the deer may not have been magical like a unicorn (illustrated), a wildlife biologist  said the cells that cause antlers to grow are ‘amazing’ and antlers are the most rapidly growing bones known in mammals . Spending time in sunlight causes male deer to release testosterone, which causes antlers to grow. At first, the antlers are quite soft – made up of soft tissue, blood and nerves – and covered by a fuzzy layer of ‘velvet’ skin. Before they harden around six months later, the antlers are sensitive, so it is likely that the young ‘unicorn’ deer suffered considerable pain when it was injured. ‘If they get hit by a car or get kicked by another deer, well, that can cause abnormal growth for the rest of the year,’ Dr Adams, director of education and outreach for the Quality Deer Management Association in Georgia, explained in the article. However, Dr Pokorny said the deer must have been healthy to reach a decent size and age. Once antlers have hardened, the deer’s body reabsorbs nutrients stored at the base of the antler, which weakens the bone above. Most deer grow their antlers in springtime and shed them in winter, but roe deer do the opposite. Unlike in some species, where mating success is determined by rutting, male roe deer attract a mate based on their age and body size.","Roe deer had a rare antler deformity that caused it's central bone .

"It is an incredible view of some of the last untouched areas on earth - and one that may not be around for long. Nasa has released a series of images of 'sanctuaries' around the globe as part of a new book released this week that highlights how the view from space is being used to protect some of the world's most interesting, changing, and threatened places. Protected areas featured in 'Sanctuary' include Hawaii's Papaphanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, New Zealand's Mount Egmont National Park, the weaving waterways of the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. In July 2014, Landsat 8 captured the isolated island of protected forest around New Zealand's Mt. Taranaki in Egmont National Park surrounded by once-forested pasturelands. Experts say this and similar images are key in protecting the world's 'sanctuaries'. The book is available for free download as a PDF file (22Mb) here . 'Sanctuary: Exploring the World's Protected Areas from Space,' published by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (Arlington, Virginia) with support from Nasa, debuted at the 2014 World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia. The once-a-decade meeting is sponsored by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world's largest global environmental organization founded in 1948. Combining  satellite imagery with nature photography, descriptions of conservation projects, and comments from park leaders and conservationists, 'Sanctuary' illustrates the contributions remote sensing is making to reaching conservation goals, responding to climate change, and improving human health and well-being. In the book's foreword, Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden wrote, 'Nasa and numerous other space agency partners from around the globe have used this view from space to make incredible scientific advances in our understanding of how our planet works. 'As a result, we can now better gauge the impact of human activity on our environment and measure how and why our atmosphere, oceans, and land are changing. 'As a former astronaut who has looked upon our beautiful planet from space, I hope that we can advance the use of space-based remote sensing and other geospatial tools to study, understand, and improve the management of the world's parks and protected areas as well as the precious biodiversity that thrives within their borders.' There are about 209,000 protected areas worldwide, covering 14 percent of the planet's land and 11 percent of coastal areas, as well as 3.6 percent of the world's oceans. One type of conservation effort highlighted in the book is the growing trend of connecting areas to protect migrating species such as the pronghorn, which migrates the longest distance of any terrestrial animal in the United States: more than 350 miles. Jonathan B. Jarvis, director of the U.S. National Park Service, states: 'For the first time in my nearly 40 years of work in the National Park Service, the four U.S. land management agencies are working together, applying the newest geospatial technologies to identify and protect critical corridors of connectivity between protected areas.' Development and agricultural clearing (pink areas) are shown encroaching the Sundarbans mangroves along the Bay of Bengal in this Landsat 8 image taken in March 2014. Imagery and content in 'Sanctuary' were provided by a range of space an environmental organisations. They include Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), DigitalGlobe Corporation, the European Space Agency, Conservation International, the World Wildlife Fund, and other organizations. Space-based Earth observations are also used as inputs into advanced computer models to help identify and predict environmental changes. With this information the conservation community can develop adaptation strategies and prepare for impacts such as disrupted migrations or increased wildfires, floods, and drought. By integrating climate model forecasts with an understanding of species habitat ranges, scientists can estimate where species may live in the future, where today's protected areas might suffer stress, or where future protected areas may need to be located. For over 10 years, NASA's basic research and applied conservation programs have advanced our understanding of global change impacts within and around protected areas. Ongoing projects include assessing coral reef health, investigating the vulnerability of U.S. National Parks to climate change, and establishing marine biodiversity observation networks. NASA's Earth science program has made numerous satellite-derived data products freely available to the research and applications community to support conservation around the world. Australia’s Great Sandy Desert as seen by Landsat 7 in 2000 shows the only sand dunes in a desert of scrub and rock.","Released to coincide with the 2014 World Parks Congress in Sydney, Australia, a once-a-decade meeting .

"Astronomers have found evidence that intergalactic 'wind' is stripping certain galaxies of the gas they need to form stars. The process was spotted in four galaxies as they fell into dense clusters of other galaxies. And the results could explain why some galaxies in clusters have so few young stars compared to others, like our own Milky Way. Astronomers from the University of Toronto and the University of Arizona have found direct evidence for galaxies being stripped of star-forming gas. Pictured is one of the observed galaxies, NGC 4522. The process occurs when a previously 'lonely' galaxy falls into a cluster . The research was carried out by astronomers from the University of Toronto and the University of Arizona using Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope. It was previously suggested that so-called 'field galaxies' - those drifting through the universe alone - would have their gas stripped away if they moved into a galaxy cluster. But these results are the first time direct evidence for that theory has been found. Earlier this month, Nasa detected a surprising surplus of infrared light in the dark space between galaxies. Baffled astronomers say the light was a diffuse cosmic glow as bright as all known galaxies combined. They believe it could be from orphaned stars flung out of galaxies. The findings redefine what scientists think of as galaxies, Nasa said. Galaxies may not have a set boundary of stars, but instead stretch out to great distances, forming a vast, interconnected sea of stars. The effect occurs as the previously single galaxy encounters a cloud of hot gas at the centre of the cluster. As it moves through this region at thousands of miles per second, the cloud acts as a wind and blows away the gas within the galaxy without disturbing its stars. The process is known as ram-pressure stripping. Previously, astronomers had seen the very tenuous atomic hydrogen gas, that surrounds a galaxy, get stripped. But it was thought these denser, molecular hydrogen clouds, where stars can form, were resistant to the wind. 'However, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is also blown from the in-falling galaxy, much like smoke blown from a candle being carried into a room,' said Dr Suresh Sivanandam of the Dunlap Institute at the University of Toronto. Amazingly, astronomers had previously spotted young stars lying in the wake of such field galaxies - providing indirect evidence for the ram-pressure stripping process. But now they have seen direct evidence of the molecular hydrogen itself, trailing in the wake of several galaxies. The research was carried out by astronomers using Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope (illustration shown) and the Hubble Space Telescope. It was previously suggested that so-called 'field galaxies' would have their gas stripped away but this is the first direct evidence . This image shows one of the observed galaxies, ESO 137-001, with a stream of gas trailing behind it. It's believed that stars can actually form in this stream of material behind the galaxy as it heads through the centre of a cluster of other galaxies . 'For more than 40 years we have been trying to understand why galaxies in dense clusters have so few young stars compared with ones like our Milky Way Galaxy, but now we see the quenching of star formation in action,' said Professor George Rieke of the University of Arizona. 'Cutting off the gas that forms stars is a key step in the evolution of galaxies from the early universe to the present.' The results, published in the Astrophysical Journal, are from observations of four galaxies - NGC 4522, CGCG 97-073, ESO 137-001 and NGC 1427a. The team made their analysis using optical, infrared and hydrogen-emission data from the Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes, as well as ground-based data. 'Seeing this stripped molecular gas is like seeing a theory on display in the sky,' said Professor Marcia Rieke, also from the University of Arizona. 'Astronomers have assumed that something stopped the star formation in these galaxies, but it is very satisfying to see the actual cause.' This remarkable image shows MACS J0152.5-2852 in the middle, a massive galaxy cluster not associated with this study. Almost every object seen in the image is a galaxy, each containing billions of stars .","Astronomers from the University of Toronto and the University of Arizona have found direct evidence for galaxies being stripped of star-forming gas .

"With every pivotal moment in human history, it seems a conspiracy theory is not far behind. When men first landed on the moon, people soon claimed that the achievement had in fact been faked in a studio in Hollywood. And when Nasa landed its Curiosity rover on Mars, some were adamant the agency had fooled us all by filming it in Nevada. And now, after Esa completed humanity's first ever landing on a comet, so-called UFO experts have claimed 67P is not a comet at all - but in fact a spaceship. Scroll down for video . UFO believers claim Europe's comet mission had a hidden task. They said comet 67P (pictured) is actually an alien spaceship sending signals. And they claim Esa sent the Rosetta spacecraft there to make contact. The bizarre claims were apparently exposed by an anonymous Esa 'whistle blower' One of the most bizarre claims was made by Scott Waring of the website UFO Sightings Daily. He said he had received an email from an anonymous Esa 'whistle blower' that claimed intelligent-sounding signals had been received from comet 67PChuryumov-Gerasimenko 20 years ago and the object is actually an alien ship in disguise. The email said: 'Do not think for one moment that a space agency would suddenly decide to spend billions of dollars to build and send a spacecraft on a 12-year journey to simply take some close-up images of a randomly-picked-out comet floating in space. 'Comet 67P is not a comet.' Comets are of great interest to scientists because they are the oldest and most primitive bodies in the solar system that we know of. They preserve the earliest record of material from the nebula from which our sun and planets formed. While the planets in the solar system have gone through chemical transformations, comets have remained almost unchanged in the 4.5 billion year history of the solar system. It is also thought that they brought certain elements to planets, including water. They also carry complex organic molecules that may triggered life on Earth. The whistle blower, who insisted on remaining anonymous for fear of reprisals, insisted the comet 'is only being disguised as such' and appears able to change trajectory at will. The letter added: 'As for who is disguising it and why I cannot answer; all I can tell you is that whatever this thing is, it does show signs on its outside of machine-like parts and unnatural terrain. 'Whatever this object is it did not ask to be found or scrutinised, and it appears for good reason.' Other theorists spoke of 'alien structures' in images of the comet, in particular a bright white 'metallic' disc on or hovering above the 2.5 mile (4km) wide lump of ice and dust, and a sculpted non-human face. Esa unwittingly sent the speculation into overdrive when it disclosed that the comet was 'singing'. Clicking oscillations in the object's magnetic field, below the range of human hearing, sounded strangely tuneful. Yesterday, Esa's Philae lander completed its landing on a comet and returned this image, which is the first ever picture from the surface of a comet. The historic moment has been heralded as one of humanity's greatest achievements in space exploration. Another post from 'ex-naval electronics warfare technician' Carl Blackman on the website BPEarthWatch said: 'Definitely not a natural signal, there is intelligent based stuff going on here.' On the same site, ImTheDaveman commented: 'This signal is very much a non-natural source. The irony of Rosetta being sent there is too strong a coincidence.' Another post on UFO Sightings Daily argued that the signal 'had to have been made for humanity'. It added: 'Is it a message of greetings? Or is it a warning of what's to come? We the people of the world need to find out.' Of course, the comet isn't really 'singing'. It is emitting a natural signal at 40-50 millihertz that, when amplified a few thousand times, sounds like a familiar sound. The music was heard clearly by the magnetometer experiment for the first time in August, when Rosetta drew to within 60 miles (100 km) of the comet. Scientists think it must be produced by the activity of the comet, as it releases neutral particles into space where they become electrically charged due to a process called ionisation. UFO expert Nigel Watson, author of Haynes UFO Investigation Manual, told MailOnline: 'The stories and rumours surrounding Comet 67P reflect the growing belief that aliens from outer space have, since the distant past, been making regular visits to our neck of the galaxy. 'The obsession with turning any unusual rock photographed on Mars into an animal or artefact, and viewing any speck of light or object captured by spacecraft cameras as alien spaceships is part of our need to believe that we are not alone. 'These activities also indicate that many ufologists have virtually given up on actually investigating UFO sightings made on Earth, and indicates their frustration with being unable to find solid evidence to prove that UFOs are alien craft.'","UFO believers claim Europe's comet mission had a hidden task .

"In October 1962, astronaut Wally Schirra took the first recognisable images of Earth from space. He used a Hasselblad camera and Zeiss lens to take the photographs on the Mercury-Atlas 8 (MA-8) mission. More than 50 years later, the unique camera has been sold at auction for $275,000 (£175,985) - more than double its initial estimates. A camera to be snapped up? A modified Hasselblad camera (pictured left) that was used by astronaut Wally Schirra (pictured right) on the Mercury-Atlas 8 mission of 1962 is to be auctioned. He used it to take the first recognisable images of Earth from space and it has been sold at auction for $275,000 (£175,985) The single lot auction took place yesterday at RR Auction’s Boston Gallery and the camera was sold to an  unnamed online bidder from the UK. Mr Schirra chose the Hasselblad 500c as his camera of choice because it was held in high regard by photographers due to its superior engineering, craftsmanship and picture quality. Hasselblad sill makes medium format cameras and is based in Gothenburg, Sweden. They were also used during the Apollo program missions when humans landed on the moon. Mr Schirra reportedly bought it himself at a Houston photo supply shop in 1962 and then took it to Nasa to prepare for his mission. MA-8 was the US' fifth manned space mission. Mr Schirra orbited the Earth six times in the Sigma 7 spacecraft during a nine-hour flight designed to test engineering features of the craft. Mr Schirra chose the Hasselblad 500c as his camera of choice because it was held in high regard by photographers because of its superior engineering, craftsmanship, overall quality. He used it to take this photo . Mr Schirra reportedly bought the camera himself at a Houston photo supply shop in 1962 and then took it to Nasa to prepare for his mission. There, it was modified, including being painted black to minimise reflections . ‘It was not until astronaut Wally Schirra - a known camera enthusiast - naturally sought the finest camera available at the time to accompany him on his MA-8 mission that Nasa’s photographic identity began to take shape,' said Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President at RR Auction. This is one of this photographs of Earth . Walter Marty Schirra Jr was born in 1923 and died seven years ago. He was a US naval officer, aviator, aeronautical engineer and test pilot - but most notably, one of the original seven astronauts chosen for Project Mercury, America's first effort to put humans in space. He flew a six hour orbit, nine hour Mercury-Atlas 8 mission on October 3, 1962. The capsule attained a velocity of 17,557 miles per hour (28,255 kph) and an altitude of 175 miles (282km). In doing so, he became the ninth human to ride a rocket into space. He was the first person to go into space three times and the only person to have flown in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions. In the third orbit, he took photographs over California, and on the sixth orbit, of South America. ‘It was not until astronaut Wally Schirra - a known camera enthusiast - naturally sought the finest camera available at the time to accompany him on his MA-8 mission that Nasa’s photographic identity began to take shape,' said Bobby Livingston, Executive Vice President at RR Auction. While his pictures are not as famous as Earthrise - a snap taken by William Anders in 1968 during the Apollo 8 mission - it paved the way for such images, which are given credit for changing people’s perceptions of planet Earth. Engineers at the United States Air Force camera laboratory worked with Wally Schirra, and later fellow astronaut Gordon Cooper to modify the camera. This included the installation of a 100-exposure film container, an aiming device mounted on the side, and modification of the camera surface. The original metal facing was repainted black to minimise reflections. Mr Cooper used the Hasselblad camera along with the  Zeiss lens on the next Mercury mission, MA-9. MA-9 was the final manned space mission of the US Mercury programme and launched on May 15, 1963. The spacecraft, named Faith 7, completed 22 Earth orbits piloted by Mr Cooper.

"Wayne Rooney, Mario Balotelli and Frank Lampard are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape. That’s according to new research, which compared the facial-width-to-height ratios (FWHRs) of high-ranking footballers to their on-pitch record. It discovered that players with faces that are wider than they are tall are more likely to score goals, but also commit fouls. Wayne Rooney (left) and Mario Balotelli (right) are successful footballers because their faces are the optimum shape, claims new research. Experts discovered that players with a high facial-width-to-height ratios (FWHRs) are more likely to score goals, but also commit fouls . The Manchester United star, nicknamed Shrek because of the shape of his head, has the features that mark out the best forwards from the rest, claim experts from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Mr Rooney, who will be awarded with a Golden Cap at Wembley on Saturday to mark his 100th appearance for England, has also received six red cards in his career. While Italian Mr Balotelli has scored 33 goals in his international career, but has also received 50 yellow cards in his career for fouls and other offences. Dr Keith Welker from the university analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 South Africa World Cup. Researchers from the University of Colorado at Boulder analysed 1,000 players from 32 countries at the 2010 South Africa World Cup. They measured each of the players' faces on a FWHR chart (pictured). FWHR is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip . Footballer Peter Crouch (left) has a low-ratio face, while Frank Lampard's face scores higher on the FWHR scale. Both midfielders and forwards with greater FWHRs were more likely to commit fouls . He measured each of their faces on a FWHR chart. Both midfielders and forwards with greater FWHRs were more likely to commit fouls. Forwards with higher FWHRs also were more likely to score or lay on goals, according to the findings published in the journal Adaptive Human Behaviour and Physiology. A recent report found that men with wider faces earn around £1,300 more than those with narrow faces when asking for a bonus. However, researchers from the University of California said this comes with a compromise, as wide-faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. A separate study from Singapore Management University found that women are drawn to men with broader faces for short-term relationships, but they do not tend to see them as husband material. This could be because men with wider faces are perceived to be more dominant and aggressive. While this may initially make them appear desirable, they are less appealing traits in a long-term partner. ‘Previous research into facial structure of athletes has been primarily in the United States and Canada,’ said Dr Welker. ‘No-one had really looked at how facial-width-to-height ratio is associated with athletic performance by comparing people from across the world.’ FWHR is the distance between the cheekbones divided by the distance between the mid-brow and the upper lip. Past studies have shown a high FWHR is associated with more aggressive behaviour. For example, high FWHR is associated with greater antisocial and unethical behaviour, but also greater success among CEOs and achievement drive among US presidents.

However, researchers from the University of California said this comes with a compromise, as wide-faced people fared less well when it came to business negotiations. The Colorado-based researchers for the latest study chose to look at the World Cup because of the quality and quantity of the data available. The theory also applies to other sports, such as rugby and cycling. Examples include rugby player James Haskell (left) and Olympic medal winner Chris Hoy (right). Scientists have several ideas about how FWHR may be associated with aggression. One possibility is it is related to testosterone exposure earlier in life . Dr Welker said: ‘There are a lot of athletic data out there. ‘We were exploring contexts to look at aggressive behaviour and found the World Cup, which quantifies goals, fouls and assists, provides a multinational way of addressing whether facial structure produces this aggressive behaviour and performance.’ The theory also applies to other sports, such as rugby and cycling. Examples include James Haskell and Olympic medal winner Chris Hoy. Scientists have several ideas about how FWHR may be associated with aggression. One possibility is it is related to testosterone exposure earlier in life. Testosterone during puberty can affect a variety of physical traits, including bone density, muscle growth and cranial shape, added Dr Welker.","Researchers analysed 1,000 players from 2010 South Africa World Cup .

"For eight years, a Pluto-bound spacecraft has been snoozing through space as it drifts nearly three billion miles (4.8 billion km) from Earth. But it will soon be time to wake up the New Horizons probe from its long slumber, as scientists prepare it for a six-month encounter with the dwarf planet. On December 6th, the piano-sized craft will come out of its hibernation to take historic images and data from Pluto – a dwarf planet whose appearance remains a mystery to astronomers. There remain many unanswered questions about Pluto. The New Horizons probe (artist's impression pictured) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on July 15, 2015 . Since launching in January 2006, New Horizons has spent 1,873 days in hibernation – about two-thirds of its flight time. It has had around 18 separate 'nap' periods spread from mid-2007 to late 2014 that ranged from 36 days to 202 days long. In hibernation mode, much of the spacecraft is unpowered; the onboard flight computer monitors system health and broadcasts a weekly beacon-status tone back to Earth. 'New Horizons is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space – nearly three billion miles from home – but its rest is nearly over,' says Alice Bowman, New Horizons mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The artist's impression shows the Pluto system from the surface of one of the smaller moons. Pluto is the large dwarf planet at centre, right. Charon, the system's largest moon, is the smaller body to the right of Pluto . 'It's time for New Horizons to wake up, get to work, and start making history.' On average, operators woke New Horizons just over twice each year to check out critical systems, calibrate instruments, gather science data, rehearse Pluto-encounter activities and perform course corrections when necessary. Next month's wake-up call was pre-programmed into New Horizons' on-board computer in August, commanding it come out of hibernation at 8pm GMT (3pm EST) on December 6. About 90 minutes later New Horizons will transmit word to Earth that it's in 'active' mode; those signals, even travelling at light speed, will need four hours and 25 minutes to reach home. As New Horizons travelled towards Pluto, it captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon, Charon. The New Horizons spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015. The 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles (429 million to 422 million km). Put together, the footage covers Pluto and almost one full rotation of its largest moon, Charon, which orbits 11,200 miles (about 18,000km) above the dwarf planet's surface. Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on Pluto's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine-tune the distance that New Horizons will fly past Pluto and its moons. Pluto's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images, but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target. New Horizons took this footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet. The footage shows Pluto and almost one full rotation of its largest moon, Charon, which orbits 11,200 miles (about 18,000km) above the dwarf planet's surface . Confirmation should reach the mission operations team at in Maryland around 2.30am GMT on December 7th. At the time New Horizons will be more than 2.9 billion miles from Earth, and just 162 million miles – less than twice the distance between Earth and the sun – from Pluto. Top on the mission's science list is characterising the global geology and topography of Pluto and its large moon Charon, mapping their surface compositions and temperatures. They also hope to examine Pluto's atmospheric composition and structure, studying the dwarf planet's smaller moons and searching for new moons and rings. New Horizons' seven-instruments includes advanced imaging infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers, a compact multicolour camera, a high-resolution telescopic camera, two powerful particle spectrometers, a space-dust detector and two radio science experiments. The entire spacecraft, drawing electricity from a single radioisotope thermoelectric generator, operates on less power than a pair of 100-watt light bulbs. Distant observations of the Pluto system begin January and will continue until late July next year, with the closest approach to Pluto on the 14th of July. 'We've worked years to prepare for this moment,' said Mark Holdridge, New Horizons encounter mission manager at APL. 'Our team has done anything but, conducting a flawless flight past Jupiter just a year after launch, putting the spacecraft through annual workouts, plotting out each step of the Pluto flyby and even practicing the entire Pluto encounter on the spacecraft. We are ready to go.'","Piano-sized craft is now three billion miles (4.8 billion km) from Earth .
