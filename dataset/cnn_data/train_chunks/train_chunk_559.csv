Horrific: Anthony Judge, 35, was jailed for life after admitting kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl in Huddersfield. She was praised for remaining calm throughout the ordeal and even asked Judge to use a condom . A 15-year-old rape victim has been praised by a judge after she tried to talk her drug-crazed attacker into using protection and remained calm throughout her ordeal. Anthony Judge, 35, was jailed for life yesterday after he admitted kidnapping the schoolgirl at gunpoint as she walked to her friend's house for a sleepover in Huddersfield - before raping her twice in a motorway lay-by. He must serve at least six years for the 'horrific offence' before being considered for parole. Judge James Spencer QC described the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons,  as 'remarkable' and 'brilliant' for showing such bravery. Judge had driven from his home in Manchester to Huddersfield on the evening of June 4 when he pounced on the young girl - putting a loaded gun to her temple and demanding she get into his car. Prosecuting at Leeds Crown Court, Kitty Taylor said: 'She was in the middle of her exams at the time and was walking home to get some things before going to her friend’s house for a sleep over. 'As she walked past the defendant’s car he leapt out with a silver revolver in his hand and put it to her temple. 'He told her to get in to the car and she did, thinking at first that it was some kind of joke. It soon became apparent that it was not. 'She tried to hide her mobile telephone in her bra but he took it from her and removed the battery. 'She thought she was going to be killed or prostituted and asked if she could send a text to her mother to say she would not be home but this request was refused. 'He asked her age and she told him she was 15. She thought that if she talked calmly to him it would be better for her.' Despite her terror, the brave teenager managed to talk manic Judge out of killing himself as he wildly snorted cocaine from a key in the front of the vehicle. The car then stopped in a layby, near Marsden, where Judge sexually assaulted and raped her. He said women and cocaine had ruined his life and all women deserved to die. Jailed: Anthony Judge was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection at Leeds Crown Court after admitting kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl . 'After raping her he said that he needed to refuel the car but told the girl that he had seven bullets in the gun and would use them on her if she tried any funny business,' added Mrs Taylor. 'At the petrol station she tried to make eye contact with other members of the public and described herself as feeling scared and in shock. 'After setting off they again stopped and again he raped her. This time she asked him if he would use a condom but he refused. 'By this point she was crying and being physically sick. He said I haven’t done anything wrong to you why are you upset. 'Throughout this ordeal she has tried her very best to keep this man calm. He then dropped her off in Huddersfield and said I’m going to leave you here because I’m going to go and kill myself. For what it’s worth I’m sorry. 'She then ran to a nearby hotel where she told two women what had happened they then phoned the police.' Judge slept rough for two nights before handing himself in at a police station in Congleton, near Manchester. He told officers 'I believe you are looking for me' and pointed to a gun in the car. Judge James Spencer QC said: 'You have pleaded guilty to the most horrendous crimes. 'You raped her not once but twice and did not use any protection not withstanding the fact that on the second occasion she asked for it. 'You had no regard for her whatsoever. Afterwards you left her and she had to find someone to help her all the while you were thinking of yourself. 'I have nothing but the utmost admiration for this girl. She is a remarkable, brilliant girl. One wonders what would have happened had she not been so unbelievably calm throughout the process.' Judge pleaded guilty to two counts of rape, kidnap, sexual assault, assault by penetration and possession of a fire arm at an earlier hearing on August 31. Along with the indeterminate sentence for public protection, Judge was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order banning him from contact with his victim and from anybody under the age of 16 for life.","Anthony Judge, 35, jailed for life after kidnapping the schoolgirl at gunpoint then raping her twice in Huddersfield .

A man cleared of child sex abuse has been named in the House of Commons by his MP - who claimed he had 'absolutely no doubt' that the man is guilty. Conservative MP Gary Streeter told the House of Commons that Geoffrey Genge, whose sexual abuse case was dropped earlier this year, is 'getting away scot-free'. Genge, 67, was due to appear in court in March this year charged with five offences of rape and sexual abuse but his case was dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The South West Devon MP took the unusual decision to name Genge in Parliament on Monday, and said the case was 'one of the worst' he had 'come across in 20 years of doing this job'. Named: Gary Streeter, right, named Geoffrey Genge in the House of Commons. Charges against Genge for sexual abuse and rape were dropped earlier this year. Streeter told Parliament that Genge was 'getting away scot-free' and said the CPS' 'handling of the case was a disaster' He told the Commons that prosecutors had failed his victims, taking the decision to drop the case against Genge 'out of the blue'. He said that the CPS' handling of the case 'had been a disaster' and called for the Attorney General to review the case. Mr Streeter was protected by parliamentary privilege while speaking in the Commons, a legal immunity meaning that he was protected from prosecutions for libel and slander. Mr Streeter told Parliament: 'I have . absolutely no doubt that Mr Genge abused my constituents when they were . children, and he is getting away scot-free.' Parliament heard how the charges against Genge, of Plymouth, Devon, related to allegations of abuse between 1957 and 1961. Referring to the decision to drop the case, Mr Streeter added: 'This is not British justice. If . action can be taken in relation to offences by Jimmy Savile who is dead, . if others are in the firing line about incidents relating to 30 or 40 . years back, why can a prosecution not take place against Mr Genge?' 'The CPS must get their act together. Every effort must be taken to ensure that justice is done.' Genge was accused of historical offences against three females. The charges included the rape and . attempted rape of one girl, the attempted rape of a second youngster and . the attempted rape and indecent assault of a third girl. A trial date was set for March 26, . 2012, but on January 10 the case against him was dropped. Judge Francis Gilbert QC thew out the case at Plymouth Crown Court and recorded a ‘not guilty’ verdict on all five counts. Mr . Streeter told Parliament that the CPS only dropped the case after . learning that Genge's solicitor was 'preparing an abuse of process . defence', whereby he would say 'that too much time had passed since the . abuses had occurred'. Mr Streeter told Parliament how one . alleged victim Margaret Felwick - who waived her legal right to . anonymity - had contacted police in February 2011. Privilege: MPs cannot be prosecuted for libel or slander for anything they say in the Parliament under a legal immunity known as parliamentary privilege . She reported a serious sex offence allegedly carried out against her by Genge 50 years ago when he was aged between 12 and 16, . Mr Streeter said she spoke out after discovering two others had allegedly been abused and all three went to the police. He said the police reassured the alleged victims it was not too late to prosecute as 'there was strong evidence to support the case'. Mrs Felwick of Plympton, Devon, was notified by the CPS in August 2011 that the prosecution would go ahead. Mr Streeter told Parliament that . prosecutors had believed there was a realistic prospect of conviction . and believed it was 'more likely than not that Mr Genge would be convicted'. This series of events was followed by the CPS decision to drop the case, prompting Mr Streeter to tell the Commons: 'So the police believed the . victims, and the CPS found them to be credible, but the case was stopped . over consideration for Mr Genge.' Mr Streeter told the Commons Mrs . Felwick was 'a gentle, reasonable and decent human being'. He added: 'I cannot think of a single motive she would have to raise this matter after all these years if it were not so that the truth could be told. Why would she want to put herself through the trauma of a trial if not for justice to be done?' 'No reference was made to the victims at all. Naturally my constituents felt like victims all over again.' He accused the CPS of acting improperly, telling the Commons: 'Why did the CPS give my constituents hope that the case would go ahead, . charge the defendant, thus bringing the matter into the public domain, . and then change its mind at the last minute? 'Abuse of process is not a . novel concept; lawyers deal with these types of issues fairly regularly. If there was a problem with the evidence, and if the defendant’s . application was likely to be successful, why did the CPS not think of . that sooner?' Solicitor General Oliver Heald said it was not possible to reopen the case, but would raise the matter with the Director of Public Prosecutions. He said: 'In this case the CPS specialist rape prosecutor who was dealing with the case, once he had the benefit of advice from counsel, he considered that a defence application to the court to stop the proceedings would be likely to succeed. 'So the decision was taken reluctantly by the CPS mindful of the distress that it could cause the complainant. But it does not follow from the decision that the complainants were or are not believed. 'Put simply the decision was taken because in this particular case the passage of time may have undermined the fairness of the proceedings on the individual facts of the case.' Following the not guilty verdict earlier this year Genge’s solicitor described the evidence as ‘weak’, the charges ‘odious’ and the case 'a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money'. In a statement following Mr Streeter’s comments, Mr Genge’s legal representative said: 'Mr Genge says that these allegations are false. On 9 January 2012 the prosecution offered no evidence in this case and Mr Genge was acquitted of all charges. 'Whilst we are relieved that the CPS took this decision finally, we remain concerned about the matter being pursued that far.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Conservative MP Gary Streeter named Geoffrey Genge in Parliament .

Two thugs convicted but then cleared of robbing a student in a defining moment of last summer’s riots demanded compensation last night. John Kafunda and Reece Donovan want cash and an apology following the quashing of their convictions. They thanked ‘British justice’ as they walked free from the Court of Appeal on Thursday, showered in champagne. They said it was ‘the best time of their lives’. The pair celebrate as they leave court. At Wood Green Crown . Court, Mr Kafunda was jailed for four years and three months for robbery . and violent disorder, and Mr Donovan for five years for robbery, . violent disorder and burglary . Rejoicing: John Kafunda (left) and Reece Donovan (right) who were jailed for robbing a Malaysian student as they pretended to help him during the riots in London after being released today . The pair, who both have criminal . records, were dubbed the ‘Bad Samaritans’ when they were jailed for attacking Ashraf Rossli, a 21-year-old from Malaysia. Mobile phone footage of two men . rifling through the rucksack of the badly injured and disorientated . student at the height of the disorder shocked the world. Kafunda and Donovan, both 23, were . identified by anonymous witnesses, gave false alibis and were placed at . the scene of the crime by mobile phone data. But they were sensationally freed after a secret hearing by a panel of judges found the witnesses could not be relied upon. Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, Ashraf Rossli is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London . From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement .

Scotland Yard said it could not reopen its investigation because there was no evidence anyone else was behind the crime. Detectives said every lead on the case had been ‘exhausted’ and they could not start again without fresh information. Kafunda and Donovan, who served 16 . months, shouted ‘get in!’ and ‘free men’ as they bounded down the steps . of the Royal Courts of Justice. Hugging his mother Lisa, Donovan said . police must now apologise, adding: ‘The police, the way the police . investigated, everything they did was wrong. The trial at the end of the . day was an unfair trial, things that should have been said were not . said.’ Asked how he felt, Kafunda added: . ‘Shock isn’t even the word. I don’t know how to put this, if I could put . everything into one word, this is the best time of our lives. I know . they took 16 months off our lives but this is the time just to show . people that this is what British justice can do.’ Riot victim: Accountancy student Ashraf Rossli, 20, had only arrived in Britain a month before the attack. Here he is pictured . at home in Malaysia. Right he is sitting with his eight-year-old . brother Mohammed Fatiri . Shocking amateur footage on YouTube showed Mr Rossli being robbed in Barking, East London, on August 8, 2011. Moments earlier the young accountancy . student, who had been in the UK only a month, had his jaw shattered by . another rioter as he cycled through a crowd. As blood poured from his mouth one man . put his arm around his shoulders while the other went through his . rucksack before strutting away with a £500 games console. Kafunda and Donovan insisted it was . not them. But a Wood Green Crown Court jury convicted them on the back . of evidence from anonymous witnesses. One said he recognised Donovan’s . clothes and his distinctive walk and another identified Kafunda from . part of his face and his tracksuit bottoms. The trial judge said the pair brought shame on the country and branded the footage an ‘iconic image of lawlessness’. Mr Rossli was treated at Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, following the attack . Kafunda, who grew up in care, was . jailed for four years and three months for robbery and violent disorder. Donovan, a heavy cannabis user with convictions for theft, affray and . assaulting a police officer, was jailed for five years for robbery, . violent disorder and burglary. But all the convictions were . overturned by the country’s top judge, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord . Judge. His panel has yet to give full reasons. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said the hearing was held in private to protect the identity of the witnesses. Solicitor Kelli Love compared her . clients’ case to that of Barry George who was wrongfully convicted of . murdering TV presenter Jill Dando. She said: ‘They wanted somebody who fitted the bill.’ Barking MP Margaret Hodge called on the authorities to try again to catch those responsible. But a Met spokesman said: ‘All lines . of inquiry have been exhausted and no further investigation can be . undertaken unless new information is forthcoming.’ Jamie Cowen, who raised thousands of . pounds for Mr Rossli with an internet campaign, said the student remains . in Britain and is ‘keeping his head down’. Kafunda, who is a trainee youth worker, served six months in prison for robbing the same victim twice in one day in 2005. Studies have shown that most of those jailed for their part in last summer’s riots have already been released. Many have been freed little more than ten months after the rioting and in some cases before the halfway point of their sentences. One academic critic said most of the August 2011 rioters were released in time to be on the streets for any potential repeat of the trouble this year. In June, only 692 people remained in jail for their part in the mayhem, or were on remand awaiting trial for serious crimes. A further 710 had served their jail term and been released. Violence flared in Tottenham, North London, on August 6 last year after a protest over the fatal police shooting of local man Mark Duggan. The trouble spread to Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham, with shops looted and buildings torched. An official inquiry into the five days of violence, which cost the country at least £500million, concluded that the shameful scenes were motivated by greed. A panel set up by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg criticised the police for not getting a grip on the violence, but said the rioters’ main objectives were getting their hands on ‘luxury branded goods’ which ‘confer instant status’. A criminal is typically released after half the sentence has been served – but if the treatment of rioters in prison had been in keeping with the tough policies the courts took when sentencing them, participants in the August disturbances would have been held for longer. Ministry of Justice figures show that the average sentence for the 1,029 rioters jailed by the Crown Courts was 19.4 months. Such offenders would normally expect to serve nearly ten months in jail before being freed. But it is believed there are still criminal cases involving offences connected to last year's riots have yet to be completed.","Millions of people watched in horror the CCTV footage of 21-year-old Ashraf Rossli being robbed .

"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 06:19 EST, 27 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:41 EST, 27 August 2012 . Activist women in Togo have today begun a sex strike in a bid to use their sexual power to unseat the president. Female members of the civil rights group Let's Save Togo are withholding sex from their husbands and partners for a week. Their aim is to cause the resignation of the President Faure Gnassingbe. Opposition leader Isabelle Ameganvi calls on Togo's women to observe a one-week sex strike beginning today, in Lome, Togo . Isabelle Ameganvi, leader of the women's rights division of the group said the strike will put pressure on Togo's men to take action. In Togo, women have equal rights with men to vote and to participate in political life, but in practice, there are few women in positions of leadership, either in formal politics or civil society, according to the OECD's Social Institutions and Gender Index. The country has been ruled by the same family for decades. President Faure Gnassingbe came to power in 2005, following the death of his father, Eyadema Gnassingbe, who ruled the West African country for 38 years. The campaign group believe they need the help of the men in the country to force President Gnassingbe to resign. Gnassingbe has not commented on the . sex strike, nor has his wife. The strike was announced at a . rally on Saturday of several thousand in the capital city, Lome. The . demonstration was organised by a coalition that is protesting recent . electoral reforms, which they say will make it easier for Gnassingbe's . party to win re-election in the parliamentary polls set for October. Women in Togo are following the example set by female activists in Liberia in 2003, who withheld sex to campaign for peace . Earlier this month, two anti-Gnassingbe . protests were dispersed by police using tear gas and more than 100 . people were arrested. At Saturday's rally, which ended . peacefully, Jean-Pierre Fabre, leader of the National Alliance for . Change opposition party, called for Gnassingbe's resignation. Other . opposition leaders called for civil disobedience. But it is the sex strike that has people talking in this small country of more than 6 million people. The Togo women are following the example set by Liberia's women, who used a sex strike in 2003 to campaign for peace. 'We have many means to oblige men to understand what women want in Togo,' Ameganvi, a lawyer, told Associated Press. Abla Tamekloe, who is participating in the sex strike, believes their actions will raise awareness of those who have been imprisoned in Togo. 'It's a good thing for us women to observe this sex strike as long as our children are in jail now. I believe that by observing this, we will get them released. 'For me, it's like fasting, and unless you fast, you will not get what you want from God.' When asked if her husband would agree, Tamekloe said: 'It is easy for me to observe it. I am used to it, but I am not sure my husband will accept, but I have to explain to him.' Another Togolese woman said she supports the sex strike, but she does not know if she can carry it out for a full week. 'I do agree that we women have to observe this sex strike but I know my husband will not let me complete it. He may agree at first, but as far as I know him, he will change overnight,' Judith Agbetoglo said. 'So I don't believe I can do the one-week sex strike. Otherwise, I will have serious issues with him. He likes that too much.' Though the call for a sex strike seemed to please many women, some men, including heads of opposition parties and human rights groups in the anti-Gnassingbe coalition, did not believe it would be a success. The women's sex strike is the latest in a string of recent protests calling for the resignation of the President Faure Gnassingbe. A peaceful protest on Saturday shows a man holding a sign which reads, 'Faure Resign' and cites an article of the constitution that protesters say gives them the right to engage in civil disobedience, during an opposition sit-in in Lome, Togo . 'One week sex strike is too much,' said Fabre of the National Alliance for Change, who suggested a shorter period, amid laughter from the crowd at the demonstration. 'Let's go for only two days.' Others were skeptical of Isabelle Ameganvi's call. 'It is easy for her to say because she is not married herself. She does not live with a man at home,' said Ekoue Blame, a Togolese journalist. 'Does she think women who live with their husband will be able to observe that? By the way, who controls what couples do behind closed doors?'","Gnassingbe family has ruled Togo for 45 years .

Almost half of single women have regularly had sex with an ex boyfriend while looking for a new lover, a new survey has revealed. The poll of 1,000 men and women found that the majority of girls who resort to sex with the ex do so because they 'miss physical intimacy.' A further 31 percent admitted it was because they hoped to reignite a relationship with a former flame. Former flames: Cheryl and Ashley Cole (left) and Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher (right) in happier times . An additional 43 percent of women also admitted to regularly sleeping with an ex while on the lookout for a new partner. An even higher 47 percent of men confessed to doing the same. And they aren't alone. A-listers Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher famously reunited after their divorce before going their separate ways again, as did Cheryl Cole and her former husband, Chelsea footballer, Ashley. Dating site SeekingArrangement.com which conducted the research said that the top five reasons for getting back into bed with an ex-partner also included having too much to drink, flirting on Facebook and other social media sites, and bumping into each other on a night out. One of the women polled, Nikki Howarth, 26, said she had slept with previous boyfriends while she was single - but warned that it can lead to more heartbreak. She said: 'It’s something most girls have done. They say, ‘never go back’ but it  can be difficult when you have been very close to a guy and you are struggling to find someone new. 'I have sometimes regretted doing it in the past – particularly when I have been keener on the guy than he was on me. Beer goggles? 26 percent of women said having too much to drink was the reason they reunited with their ex . 'Sleeping with them again just leads to more heartache – because there is no chance of the relationship working out in the long-term and you are just left to reflect on what you have lost.' Nikki, who is currently dating a wealthy American businessman, said revisiting past relationships can work if both partners want the same thing. 'If no one is getting hurt on either side, I don’t see what is wrong with ‘sex with the ex’,' she said. 'It can be a lot of fun  - who doesn’t want a bit of physical intimacy when they have been single for a while. 'You often go to the same pubs and clubs as your ex because that is where you met in the first place. 'If you part amicably there is no reason why you shouldn’t both end up going to the same places again.

"By . Nick Enoch . PUBLISHED: . 04:33 EST, 27 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:38 EST, 27 August 2012 . Kim Ramsey, 44, has a medical condition which can cause up to 100 orgasms a day . Some people fake them, others ache for them but for one woman, the big 'O' is the bane of her life... as she has to endure up to 100 orgasms a day. Kim Ramsey, 44, has a medical condition which makes her feel constantly aroused. Even the slightest pelvic movement - on a train, in a car, doing domestic chores - can trigger a climax, but the sheer volume has left her tired, in pain and unable to have a normal relationship. Ms Ramsey, a nurse originally from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, suffers from Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder (PGAD). Doctors believe the incurable syndrome was caused by an accident in 2001 when she fell down some stairs. This may have led to a Tarlov cyst on her spine, at the point where a woman's orgasm originates. 'Other women wonder how to have an orgasm - I wonder how to stop mine,' she told The Sun. Ms . Ramsey, who has since moved to Montclair, New Jersey, first noticed the . problem in 2008 after having sex with a new boyfriend. She said: 'I had constant orgasms for four days. I thought I was going mad. 'We tried everything to make it stop. Squats, deep breathing,  I even sat on frozen peas but the orgasms and . sexual arousal continued for 36 hours - I must have had around 200 . orgasms during that period. The pain and exhaustion was excruciating.' Ms Ramsey . said she now finds it hard to go about her daily life as she is worried she will not be able . to control the sexual arousal. She said she no longer feels like she . has control over her own body: 'Imagine feeling aroused for no reason other than you got up that day. 'I've even had one in public. I was travelling home on the train and it was a bit of a bumpy ride. 'Every jerk of the train or vibration made me more aroused and it was a 40-minute journey so there was nothing I could do. 'I just had to bite my lip and sit on my hands and hope no one noticed.' Although the sensations experienced . during PGAD may seem like arousal, they are not actually based in any . sexual desire, thoughts or behaviour, and it is unconnected to libido. Any pressure on the genitals can result in increased intensity - and also bring on the urge to urinate. Due . to shame, guilt and fear of rejection, it is not clear how many people . have the condition, as some patients may suffer in silence. Ms Ramsey added: 'Both women and men just don't . seem to get it - they seem to think it's a great thing and, believe me, . it's really not.' Even a train journey has become a nightmare for Ms Ramsey. She said: 'Every jerk of the train or vibration made me more aroused and it was a 40-minute journey so there was nothing I could do' (file photo) Despite going to several specialists about her condition, doctors remain unable to help. The condition is very rare and there has so far been very little research into it. Ms Ramsey only received an official . diagnosis, in Pennsylvania, in June and will travel to London next month to see a PGAD expert. She said: 'At the moment I am able to work. But . without the correct treatment this condition can limit my ability to . work. I don't want that. It's already destroyed my chance of having a . relationship.' Dr David Goldmeier, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London said: 'Persistent genital arousal disorder is a newly recognised condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire. 'PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer. 'This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms. 'Tarlov cysts are small jelly like cysts that form around the sacral area of the spine. They are a common finding in normal people. One current research paper suggests that a lot of women who have PGAD have Tarlov cysts, but this is contentious. 'There is very little research into Tarlov cysts and PGAD. But due to the relatively high occurrence of Tarlov cysts currently observed in women who suffer from PGAD symptoms, it would seem advisable to suspect Tarlov cysts as a possible underlying factor in the cause of PGAD. 'Tarlov cysts can cause problems with the pelvic nerves and are reported to produce genital symptoms that bear similarities to those described for PGAD. 'Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon. 'I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know. 'Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.'","Kim Ramsey, 44, has incurable Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder .

Myleene Klass, Victoria Beckham and Isla Fisher are among a number of celeb supporting a new campaign to encourage more women around the world to breast feed to save their baby's life. According to Save the Children, 830,000 babies could be saved every year - . that's 95 every hour - if mothers across the globe breastfed within the . first hour of giving birth. Breast milk provides a newborn with vital antibodies which make them stronger and less likely to catch fatal diseases. Yet in numerous third world countries women are using formula milk instead - even though they can barely afford it. Sad story: Myleene with young mother Vilma who lost a baby to pneumonia because she didn't realise she could breastfeed . Myleene visited the slums of Manila in the Philippines to meet some of the young mothers struggling to raise their children in appalling conditions. She was moved to tears when she met one woman, Vilma, 20, whose bottle-fed baby had recently died of pneumonia when he was just seven months old. In a video you can view below, Vilma tells Myleene she didn't realise she could breastfeed and instead went hungry herself to buy expensive milk formula. Myleene said: 'I was really shocked that Vilma didn't have access to the basic information that may have saved her son's life. 'The information is out there but it doesn't seem to be hitting this part of the world. It's very frustrating and very sad that another mum has gone through this.' Appalling conditions: The presenter was shocked by the standard of living in this part of the Philippines . Hope: Children like this one are more likely to survive if they are breastfed from birth . Save the Children have found that that many mothers like Vilma are relying on expensive formula milk, when they could provide a much better source of nourishment for their babies themselves, because they simply aren't aware of the health benefits of breastfeeding. The charity's chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'Despite the . benefits of breastfeeding being widely known in the developed world, and . it being a free, natural way to protect a newborn baby, too little . attention is being paid to help mums breastfeed in poorer countries.' Myleene breastfed her own daughters, Ava, five and Hero, 23 months. She said in today's Daily Record: 'Every mum wants the best for their . children. I grew up in the UK so I knew what my children needed as . babies and I could make an informed choice about whether to breast or . bottlefeed. 'In the ­Philippines, people don’t have . that knowledge. They often don’t even have the facilities to boil water . for mixing with formula milk.' Myleene meets a newborn on her trip: The mother-of-two wants women in other countries to have the same access to information on breastfeeding that she had . The problem isn't just in the ­Philippines, the number of women breastfeeding is declining across East Asia and in some African countries such as Ethiopia and Nigeria. Save the Children blame the problem on 'the prevalence of traditional practices as well as a severe shortage of health workers and examples of inappropriate marketing techniques by some baby milk substitute companies.' Myleene added: 'It comes down to a combination of . factors, including a lack of health workers to give good advice, lack of . education and marketing practices of some firms who, according to some . mums I spoke to, convince them that formula is better.' The charity are seeking to make women more aware that breast is best by highlighting the importance of breastfeeding in the first hour of a baby's life. The charity state: 'If babies receive colostrum – the mother’s first milk – within an hour of birth, it will kick start the child’s immune system, making them three times more likely to survive. And, if the mother continues feeding for the next six months, then a child growing up in the developing world is up to 15 times less likely to die from killer diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea.' Change for the better: Myleene meets single mother Josephine, 18, and her child Jihan, aged 4 months, in Manila. The young mother used to use formula but is now being taught that breast is best . The charity sent actress Isla Fisher to the slums of Sao Paulo, Brazil, to see how action there has already been saving lives. 'Over past 20 years the government have slashed the infant mortality rate by over 50 per cent and one of the ways they've done that is using a unique superfood - breast milk,' she said. Victoria Beckham was among celebs who joined Myleene and Isla by Tweeting her support of the campaign today writing: 'As a mother I know how crucial the first hour of a baby life's is. This is why I'm supporting @savethechildren #firsthour.' Mr Forsyth explained: 'If every baby was fed during the first hour of life – what we call the 'power hour' – we estimate that up to 830,000 newborn deaths could be prevented every year; that’s 95 babies every hour. And if mums were helped to breastfeed for up to six months, many more children would be protected from killer diseases like pneumonia and diarrhoea. It is a matter of life and death.' In a report published today, called ­Superfood for Babies, Save the Children call on the Government to use their G8 presidency in June to fund breastfeeding nutrition work. They also want baby formula companies such as Nestlé and Danone to give over a third of their product packaging to warnings of the potential health risks of not breastfeeding. They have found that some formula companies in Asia have violated the internationally agreed code for the marketing of breast milk substitutes by implying it's better than the real thing.

Astronomers have discovered the biggest spiral galaxy yet seen - and say it may be now giving birth to a new, smaller galaxy thanks to a collision with another. The spectacular barred spiral galaxy NGC 6872 has ranked among the biggest stellar systems for decades, but a new analysis has know crowned it the largest known spiral. Measuring tip-to-tip across its two out-sized spiral arms, NGC 6872 spans more than 522,000 light years - more than five times bigger than the Milky Way. Giving birth: A previously unsuspected tidal . dwarf galaxy candidate (circled) appears only in the ultraviolet off the . north-west arm of NGC 6872 , indicating the presence of many hot young . stars. IC 4970, the small disc galaxy interacting with NGC 6872, is located above the spiral's central region . And a comparatively recent collision with another galaxy may now be causing one outer arm of the spiral to spawn fresh stars that may eventually break away into new galaxy. A team of astronomers from Brazil, Chile and the U.S. made the new findings based on an examination of archival data from Nasa's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite. 'Without GALEX's ability to detect the ultraviolet light of the youngest, hottest stars, we would never have recognized the full extent of this intriguing system,' said lead scientist Rafael Eufrasio. He presented the findings Thursday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach, California. Six new comets described as 'a missing link' of the formation of planets, have been spotted in other star systems. The discovery more than doubles the number of comets known outside the home solar system and suggests they are just as common as planets. The comets, or exocomets as they are called when in other solar systems, are left over from a time when planets were forming. Most comets that were formed around a star would have been absorbed by new planets the ones that can be seen now are thought to be left over – the cosmic equivalent of builders’ rubble. Finding new exocomets is thought to be a clue to astronomers that a star is likely to have planets orbiting it. The galaxy's unusual size and . appearance stem from its interaction with a much smaller disk galaxy . named IC 4970, which has only about one-fifth the mass of NGC 6872. The odd couple is located 212million light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Pavo. Astronomers think large galaxies, including our own, grew through mergers and acquisitions - assembling over billions of years by absorbing numerous smaller systems. Intriguingly, the gravitational interaction of NGC 6872 and IC 4970 may have done the opposite, spawning what may develop into a new small galaxy. 'The northeastern arm of NGC 6872 is the most disturbed and is rippling with star formation, but at its far end, visible only in the ultraviolet, is an object that appears to be a tidal dwarf galaxy similar to those seen in other interacting systems,' said team member Duilia de Mello, a professor of astronomy at Catholic University. The tidal dwarf candidate is brighter in the ultraviolet than other regions of the galaxy, a sign it bears a rich supply of hot young stars less than 200million years old. The researchers studied the galaxy across the spectrum using archival data from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, as well as GALEX. By analysing the distribution of energy by wavelength, the team uncovered a distinct pattern of stellar age along the galaxy's two prominent spiral arms. The youngest stars appear in the far end of the northwestern arm, within the tidal dwarf candidate, and stellar ages skew progressively older toward the galaxy's centre. The southwestern arm displays the same pattern, which is likely connected to waves of star formation triggered by the galactic encounter. Cosmic collision: Simulations show how . the collision between NGC 6872 and IC 4970 produced the features . of the galaxies as we see them today. IC 4970's closest encounter occurred 130million years ago and the smaller galaxy followed a path (dashed curve) close to the plane of the spiral's disc and in the same direction it rotates . A 2007 study by Cathy Horellou at Onsala Space Observatory in Sweden and Baerbel Koribalski of the Australia National Telescope Facility developed computer simulations of the collision that reproduced the overall appearance of the system as we see it today. According to the closest match, IC 4970 made its closest approach about 130million years ago and followed a path that took it nearly along the plane of the spiral's disk in the same direction it rotates. As in all barred spirals, NGC 6872 contains a stellar bar component that transitions between the spiral arms and the galaxy's central regions. Measuring about 26,000 light years in radius, or about twice the average length found in nearby barred spirals, it is a bar that befits a giant galaxy. The team found no sign of recent star formation along the bar, which indicates it formed at least a few billion years ago. Its aged stars provide a fossil record of the galaxy's stellar population before the encounter with IC 4970 stirred things up. 'Understanding the structure and dynamics of nearby interacting systems like this one brings us a step closer to placing these events into their proper cosmological context, paving the way to decoding what we find in younger, more distant systems,' said team member and Goddard astrophysicist Eli Dwek.","New analysis shows NGC 6872 is the largest known spiral galaxy .

America’s queen of crime-writing Patricia Cornwell once ordered an investigation into one of Britain's most acclaimed female police officers, saying she was a jilted lover and a 'threat,' according to court documents. Cornwell's relationship with Caroline Nicholl, now a renowned criminologist, was revealed in court documents regarding Cornwell's ongoing legal battle with her financial advisers over $40 million in squandered wealth. In a 2008 email exchange filed by the defense, Cornwell asked an American police officer to conduct 'checks' on Nicholl, who was a chief superintendent with the Thames Valley police at the time of the relationship 17 years ago. Old flames: Patricia Cornwell, right,  is quoted as saying that she ‘once had a relationship’ with Caroline Nicholl, left, now  a renowned criminologist . In one email she wrote: ‘I have a few . names of people who we should be “aware” of in terms of them being a . problem/threat to me.' Nicholl's name was at the top of the list. ‘I once had a relationship with her . that ended badly,’ the e-mail read. ‘I cut her off and wouldn’t have . anything to do with her.’ Nicholl said she was stunned by news of the filing. ‘I don’t understand anything that I could have done to precipitate this,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘The last time I saw her was in 1996,' she said. 'It’s accurate that she broke it off. She didn’t give a reason.’ Ms Nicholl, 57, has now been dragged into the . proceedings in the District Court in Boston in which 56-year-old Ms .

Nicholl's affair with Cornwell began when she invited Cornwell to do research for her books in Milton Keynes, a British town. ‘She was very smart, self-effacing and charming, and she clearly was enamored that I was a police chief,' Nicholl said. 'She thought the uniform was amazing.' ‘We were introduced by a police contact who was a mutual friend,' she added. 'I didn’t know who she was. I’d never read any of her books. So I was expecting an old biddy or something. ‘The next time we met was when she was on a book tour in London. I invited her up to Milton Keynes because she liked to do research.

Before her affair with Nicholl, Cornwell had been married for nine years, from 1980 until 1989, to an English professer named Charles Cornwell who was 17 years her senior. Shortly after the couple split, she began having an affair with Margo Bennett, a married FBI agent. The year-long affair ended in 1992 and it was revealed four years later, after Bennett's estranged husband was arrested and later convicted of attempting to murder Margo.

Hollywood star Angelina Jolie met with Syrian refugees in Turkey today to draw attention to the plight of the hundreds of thousands who have fled their nation's civil war. The trip by Jolie, who is a special envoy for the U.N. refugee agency, comes as Turkey grows increasingly concerned that the number of registered Syrian refugees on its soil - about 80,000 - is becoming difficult to manage.

Looking after each other in horrendous conditions: a homeless boy holds his little brother close on a footpath in New Delhi . Hostile environment: a homeless girl on the railway tracks in New Delhi . Rather than looking after them, heavy-handed police officials treat them like any other petty criminals. One homeless project manager even says that they are often beaten for being on the street. Among the children struggling to keep going is Sanjay Kumar, 13, who sells car phone chargers at a busy traffic junction. He came from Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states, and now survives by earning up to 300 rupees (£3.50) on a 'good day'. Sanjay explained: 'I ran away from my home six years ago because my father used to beat me up.' 'One day I ended up on a train and when I woke up I was here.

A businessman accused of murder after he stabbed a drug-crazed burglar to death during a bungled raid was vindicated of all wrongdoing by a coroner today. Homeowner Vincent Cooke, 41, had been arrested after career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, suffered up to nine knife wounds as he broke into Cooke's luxury four bedroom home in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester. During the raid, Jacob and an accomplice held a knife to the throat of a terrified Mr Cooke saying: 'We will f****** slit your throat, get your money, get your jewellery - we will kill you.' They then frogmarched him upstairs to his study and then to his kitchen in a search for jewellery and a large quantity of cash. Vincent Cooke, pictured with his wife Karen, killed burglar Raymond Jacob in a knife fight in 2011. He has been vindicated of any wrongdoing by a coroner today . But when the victim’s wife Karen, 36, and 14-year-old son Anthony returned home from a football tournament, Mr Cooke grabbed a carving knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbed Jacob during a violent struggle. Mr Cooke - who said he acted in lawful self defence - was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge, but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged. He and his family have been forced to quit their luxury home due to them suffering nightmares about the tragedy almost 18 months ago. Raymond Jacob (left) was stabbed to death by Vincent Cooke while carrying out a break-in at Mr Cooke's home in Bramhall, Cheshire. His father Raymond Jacob Senior (right) pictured outside Stockport Coroner's Court for today's inquest . It emerged the raiders had been given information about Mr Cooke’s safe from the victim’s uncle who helped him run a transport storage firm. Last year Jacob’s accomplice Michael Thorpe, 34, of Heald Green, Stockport, Greater Manchester, was jailed for ten years after admitting aggravated burglary. The coroner John Pollard backed Mr Cooke after hearing him insist he used reasonable force against the burglar at an inquest into Jacob’s death amid a large police security operation at Stockport coroners court. Mr Pollard also dismissed attempts by Thorpe to smear Mr Cooke’s integrity after the thug was brought from jail to give evidence. Burglar Michael Thorpe was jailed for ten years after a bungled raid in which homeowner Vincent Cooke stabbed Thorpe's accomplice Raymond Jacob to death during a struggle . Recording a narrative verdict the coroner said: 'Vincent Cooke was terrified by the two men, both of them had knives and we know that a knife was found on Mr Jacob. 'Vincent Cooke, inside his own home, is entitled to be very fearful and entitled to use reasonable and appropriate force to protect him family and his property. 'I note that he and Mr Jacob were having a knife fight and he was fighting for his life. I also note that Mr Jacob obtained nine knife wounds and Vincent Cooke only one. 'Mr Jacob had a considerable amount of drugs including alcohol in his system and you could see how this could make him react. 'One thing is certain is that it would have had an affect on slowing his reactions and making it more difficult to strike and defend himself as a sober man would and this would account for the disparity of injuries. 'I have little doubt that Mr Jacob went with Mr Thorpe to commit a burglary or robbery, equipped and prepared to use a knife or knives to threaten Vincent Cooke and his family. 'The householder is entitled to use reasonable force to defend himself.' The tragedy occurred in September 2011 when Mr Cooke, who had been at his £350,000 home watching TV, answered a knock at his front door . There stood a man in a high-visibility jacket claimed to be from the gas board, but Jacob and Thorpe suddenly burst in. Mr Cooke, a former director of a delivery firm, said: 'I thought Karen had forgotten her keys and I put on a daft voice saying: ""Who is it?"". Then I could make out high-vis colours and a voice replied back ""gas"". I had no reason to doubt that they were not officials but the door flew open so much so that I flew backwards and two men rushed in and shouted ""customs"". 'One had a blue-coloured clipboard and tried to pretend it was formal paperwork, when I tried to say ""can I have a look a that "" and see some identification they said, ""no, you are being robbed mate"". 'They both pulled out knives and grabbed hold of me on either side and that was it I was under their control. Scene of ordeal: Mr Cooke was confronted on his doorstep by two thugs who then forced their way into his home in the Cheshire stockbroker belt last year . Security: There was a large police presence outside Stockport Coroner's Court for the inquest into the death of burglar Raymond Jacob . 'Their first words once they dropped the act were ""no police, no alarms or you are dead. Where is your wife and son? Give us your money, give us your jewellery, the Rolex"".’ 'They pulled the knives from their midriffs and brandished them throughout, they shouted ""upstairs upstairs"". 'One was on my left, the other on my right with the knives at the side of my throat, being frogmarched. 'I tried telling them several times that I had no money and pointed out that I was just a van driver. They were demanding £40,000, I didn’t have any money.' 'They said :""We know you have money,  we have paid for this information we will f****** slit your throat, get your money, get your jewellery, we will kill you, we will kill you"". 'I suppose anyone going past our home might think we were well off but that was far from the truth, we were an average family earning average wages and paying off a mortgage. Conspirator: Michael Thorpe arriving at Stockport Coroner's Court in handcuffs . 'I pleaded with them to leave, I said my wife and kid would be back shortly. I thought if I told them they would have some humanity.' He told them that there was a safe downstairs but there was nothing in it. He was forced back downstairs at knifepoint, while Thorpe was upstairs. In his statement Mr Cooke said that he went back to the kitchen and he glanced to the left and he saw his wife in the kitchen doorway. Her sudden appearance shocked Jacob. Mr Cooke said: 'He didn’t know what to do at first and looked at Karen and then looked at me and lunged at me with the knife he had. 'I grabbed a knife from the block in the kitchen and ran at him and knocked him to the ground. It was the closest thing to me. 'I barged at him, I didn’t stab him straight away. I tried to disarm him but as we crashed into the hallway, I remember thinking: ""You need to get to your feet"". 'It was a matter of who could get to their feet first, we both got up. 'It was a knife fight then, who could stab each other first, we were both brandishing knives at each other. 'He was stabbing with his knife and I was stabbing with mine, we were both just basically trying to stab each other. It was a knife fight and it was horrible. 'I felt if I wasn’t quicker than him he would stab and kill me. I didn’t know where my wife and son were. 'Then I heard her screaming and at first I thought Thorpe had thrown Anthony into the back of the van because it drove off at speed.' Jacob suffered superficial wounds to his arm, wrist and knee but sustained a fatal wound to his thigh which severed a vital artery.  He bled to death whilst attempting to flee the scene. Tests showed he had traces in his bloodstream of alcohol, methadone, morphine, codeine, cocaine, diazepam, caffeine and nicotine. He had previously been on heroin. The villain had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft and once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'. During the hearing Mr Cooke dismissed as 'ludicrous' claims Thorpe had visited the house previously. Police said there was no evidence of previous contact between them. It is believed that these pictures, taken outside the coroner's court, show family members of Raymond Jacob .","Vincent Cooke, 40 was confronted on his doorstep by two men .

KFC Thailand has issued an apology after being criticised for a Facebook message that urged people to rush home during Wednesday's tsunami scare and order a bucket of KFC chicken. As people were being urged to evacuate from beach areas, the company posted this message: 'Let's hurry home and follow the earthquake news. And don't forget to order your favorite KFC menu.' It prompted hundreds of angry comments on a variety of Thai web forums that denounced the company as insensitive and selfish. By Thursday the message was removed and replaced by one that asked for forgiveness. Wednesday's earthquakes in Indonesia revived memories of the 2004 Asian tsunami that claimed 230,000 lives, including more than 8,000 people in Thailand. Rush: Clogged streets in Banda Acey as people grab whatever vehicles they can find and head to the hills. There were fears that a tsunami could be as bad as the one on Boxing Day in 2004 . Panic: People in Banda Aceh scramble to ecsape the city after a tsunami warning was issued . It follows news that five people died after suffering . heart attacks with several more injured in the aftermath of yesterday's Indonesian . tsunami earthquakes that sparked mass panic. Two powerful earthquakes in the . region's westernmost province, Aceh, triggered hysteria for millions of . people as they fled high ground when a tsunami warning was raised. Aceh, close to . the epicenter of yesterday's tremors, bore the brunt of the tidal wave . eight years ago but millions were breathing a sigh of relief after the . tsunami warnings were lifted. Life . quickly got back to normal today as residents assessed the damage left . by the earthquake, consisting of cracks in the walls of houses and . structural damage to a bridge. Usman Basyah, 45, who lost one of his . sons in the 2004 disaster that killed 170,000 people in Aceh alone, . said: 'I really feel my prayers were answered. I'm so grateful. 'We've gone through enough trauma already.' Buildings shook for four minutes and there were reports of people jumping from windows in a desperate attempt to escape. Patients also poured out of hospitals, some with drips still attached to their arms. In some places, electricity was briefly cut. There were also scenes of panic in Bangalore, India and Columbo in Sri Lanka as terrified people fled their homes and offices. Then, two hours later, a massive aftershock - with a similarly huge . magnitude of 8.2 - struck only 110 miles further out to sea, unleashing . even more panic. Tsunami waves, measuring 3ft in height, hit Sumatra, the island Aceh is on. But experts discovered that both quakes were the wrong type to issue a disaster and the warnings were lifted. Rush: Residents of Banda Aceh evacuate following a tsunami warning after two massive earthquakes . Piled up: A father loads his wife and four children on to his moped and drives off . Roger Musson, seismologist at the . British geological survey who has studied Sumatra's fault lines, said . the earthquake was a strike-slip quake. The tsunami triggering 9.1-magnitude earthquake of seven years go - which killed 230,000 people, three quarters of whom lived in Aceh - was a thrust quake, which causes . the sea bed to flip up. The earthquakes occurred as Prime Minister David Cameron visited Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, which is 1,600 miles south-east of Aceh and on a different island, Java. No tremors were felt there. He told President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono: ‘Our thoughts should be with those who are affected. ‘Britain of course stands ready to help if help is required. ‘We will stand with you and your government and your people at this time of worry. Fears: Lines in the ocean show how far tsunami waves could travel in just a few hours . Impact: Both quakes hit just a few hundred miles off the coast of Aceh. The first hit at 8.38am GMT. It was followed by a massive aftershock (marked 2) at 10.43am GMT.  The black star indicates the epicentre of the 2004 earthquake that triggered a devastating tsunami.

Concern: An Acehnese woman with a child tries to stop a car to go to higher ground after tremors are felt . Mr . Yudhoyono moved to calm nerves, saying that there appeared to be no . serious casualties and local residents had been taken to safety. He added that ‘as of this time there is no threat of tsunami’ - despite an international warning being issued. He added: ‘The situation is under control so far. It is a very different situation from 2004 when Aceh was faced with a deadly tsunami.’ The tremor was felt in Singapore, Thailand, Bangladesh, Malaysia and India. A tsunami warning has been issued for cities all along the coast of Sumatra.

There were also reports of the water level dropping in the Thai resort of Phuket - a sign that the sea is drawing back in preparation to launch an enormous wave. A tsunami watch means there is the potential for a tsunami, not that one is imminent. Since 2004 such warnings are issued after every earthquake in the Pacific. Indonesia straddles a series of fault lines that makes the vast island nation prone to volcanic and seismic activity. Last year's devastating tsunami in Japan was triggered by an earthquake with a similar hypocentre depth 20 miles below the surface. The earthquake that struck . off the coast of Aceh today has chilling parallels with the disaster . that obliterated the region on Boxing Day, 2004. More . than 230,000 thousand people were killed by the resulting tsunami that . swept inland and washed away homes. A further 250,000 people were . injured by the catastrophe, which was the sixth deadliest ever recorded. But . so unpredictable is the whim of nature that today's earthquake - . despite being almost as powerful - has not had the same fatal effects. The . tsunami that struck in the Indian Ocean in 2004, was caused by a 9.1 . magnitude earthquake. Today's earthquake measures 8.7 on the Richter . scale. Damage: Residents are swept away in the . raging torrents that engulfed parts of Sri Lanka after the earthquake . off the coast of Indonesia in 2004. The quake was more catastrophic than . the recent one . Flood waters in Thailand lap around the damage homes that were crushed by the tsunami that struck off Indonesia in 2004 . Power: A wall of water crashes over a street in Miyako City, Japan during last year's devastating tsunami there . Although there is a slight difference in the strength, it would still be strong enough to cause significant damage. The . biggest tsunami ever recorded was triggered by an 8.3 magnitude . earthquake in Lituya Bay, Alaska on July 9, 1958 - less powerful than . the most recent quake in Indonesia. And the Japan 2011 tsunami was . brought on by 9.0 magnitude quake. So why has today's quake not caused a killer tsunami? The quake struck 20.5 miles below the sea bed whereas the one in 2004 was slightly closer to the sea at just 19 miles. However, due to continual movement of . the plates over the last eight years there position today will be . different to when disaster struck before. The position of the plates . when one of them breaks and causes seismic waves is a vital part of what . causes the tsunami. Although both earthquakes formed on the . fault line where the India and Burma plates meet, today's earthquake did not cause disruption in the water. Roger . Musson, seismologist at the British geological survey who has studied . the fault lines off Sumatra in northern Indonesia said that today's . tremor was a strike-slip quake, not a thrust quake which causes the sea . bed to flip up. It is not impossible for strike-slip earthquakes to generate vertical uplift of water, . 'When I first saw this was an 8.7 near Sumatra, I was fearing the worst,' Mr Musson said. 'But as soon as I discovered what type of earthquake it was, then I felt a lot better.' Mega . tsunamis strike when the plates create changes in the water pressure. The plates will have moved under each other differently today than how . they did in 2004, creating less change in the water pressure. Moreover, . researchers studying the 2004 quake found small but significant jumps . of between 5 and 10 millimeters at stations as far as 3000 kilometres . from the epicentre. They also found the rupture was 1000km long and . spread rapidly northwards from its origin. This . damage makes a significant difference because it is the 'snapping' motion of the earth's crust below the ocean that causes movement in the . water above it.  If the plates do not displace a large amount of water, . the power of the underwater waves will be less. In . this case it appears that even though an underwater earthquake has been . recorded, the disruption to the sea bed has not been strong enough to . create momentum in the water. The . analyusts from Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris studied GPS data . showing that the  damage caused by the earthquake was at least 200km . north of its epicentre. The severity and location of the  damage to seabed caused by today's earthquake is still unclear. One . aspect of tsunamis that is within man's control are the warnings that . can be put in place. In 2004 there were no alerts telling people that a . tidal wave was on its way. Following . the damage, The Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was established . following a United Nations conference in Kobe, Japan, in January 2005. Seventeen . seismic stations were placed in the ocean to detect plate movements and . tremors. These sensors then pass the information to two recording . stations which sound sirens and even make automated phone calls and send . text messages and emails to residents.

Marriage counselor Sheila Loven told her client his marriage was over so he would have sex with her . A marriage counselor who used therapy sessions to drive a couple to divorce so she could continue her affair with the husband told him his marriage was over to get him into bed. Sheila Loven, . 47, of Euless, Texas, had been taking John and Brenda Holliday, from Arlington, for joint . therapy in 2009 and recommended it would be better to have individual . sessions. It was in these private sessions that . Loven allegedly worked on turning the husband and wife against each . other, persuading wife Brenda Holliday to file for a divorce and . coercing the husband John into having an affair with her. She has been charged with sexual assault and faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted. The first time the husband visited Loven's apartment after they had been out drinking together the night before in June 2009, she straddled him and kissed him, the court heard yesterday. He testified he didn't feel good about it and it made him want his wife more. But he didn't believe there was any chance of getting her back after he sent her flowers, her favorite coffee and a muffin to her work to show her that he had been thinking about her. Her response was to tell him to never do that again, according to the Star Telegram. Loven also told him that his wife was through with him. Mr Holliday told the court yesterday that he believed his marriage was over because Loven told him it was. Mark Scott, one of Loven's attorneys, asked the husband whether he knew . he was going to have sex with his counselor when he returned to her apartment . days later. 'You went over to Sheila's house to have sex?' Scott asked. Mr Holliday answered: 'That's pretty accurate. No one had shown me any attention like that in months,' adding that his wife had starved him of attention and withdrawn her love. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A tearful Brenda Holliday took the stand on Wednesday and testified about her relationship with Loven, which she described as 'visiting my best friend once a week to talk' Sheila Loven counseled a couple in 2009 and allegedly used her counseling influence to encourage the wife to file for divorce, then had an affair with her husband, according to prosecutors . Threatening and profane text messages sent from Loven were read out during her sexual assault trial on Wednesday. After . the Hollidays reconciled, Loven is said to have sent them a number of . cruel texts until they went to police and reported her for harassment. One text message read: 'When are you going to figure out you are nothing without me. I made you into a man.' A message to the man's wife read: 'And then he talks about your body so bad while he's touching every inch of mine.' 'I hope you enjoyed your lunch. Didn't see me did you?' another text said. But . police turned the charge into sexual assault, saying the 47-year-old . used her influence as a professional counselor to persuade the husband . to have sex with her. Wife Brenda Holliday tearfully testified to the court on Wednesday that Loven became like a best friend to her and she believed she had found the perfect counselor, describing their visits like 'going to talk to my best friend once a week'. 'There was nothing I did not tell her,' the wife testified. 'I thought . that she genuinely cared about me and I told her how lucky I was to have . found her. She told me it was a God thing. She would always give me a . big hug before I left.' 'It wasn't marriage counseling, it was divorce counseling,' Mrs Holliday said in court. Mrs Holliday also revealed Loven told her that her husband was a 'narcissist' and had stopped coming to sessions and following her directions to save the marriage. All the while she was allegedly having an affair with him. Loven's . attorney said it was a legitimate relationship which blossomed from . romance and there is no evidence of emotional coercion. Adam Burny said: 'It had all the . elements of any other romantic relationship. They went out to nightclubs . and dinner, and they spent almost every night together. What you will . not see in this case is any evidence of manipulation.' But the prosecution argued there was . manipulation from the beginning - when she started to see them . separately to 'collect their secrets' and then using these secrets to . drive a wedge between them. Loven advised the wife to get a divorce and then asked the husband on a date. Days later, the pair began having sex. She . stopped office sessions with the husband but continued to have sex with . him, while continuing to counsel his wife, prosecutor Betty Arvin said. 'She was the ultimate inside trader,' Arvin said. 'She got information about their lives that they had never . shared with anyone and she used it, she twisted it for her own sick . reasons.' The wife also revealed yesterday that after she filed for a divorce and told her husband to leave the house, he pleaded to be allowed to return home and would call constantly, saying he was suicidal. The husband testified that he was so . depressed after the divorce papers were filed that he went only to work . and then returned home. 'I'd play Russian roulette with my .357,' the husband said. 'A couple of times I put it to my head and clicked it.' The first night he was able to go out was when Loven invited him out to a club with her. The next day she invited him over to her house when he said she straddled him and kissed her. According to the star Telegram he told the court: 'Sheila got up from the chair and . straddled me and kissed me. It scared me. I hadn't . kissed anyone except my wife for years and years.' Mrs Holliday said that when Loven eventually confessed to her that she was the one having an affair withher husband, she said to her: 'For a year, you told me what a mess-up . he is, and you're a licensed professional counselor. 'Why would you want him? She said everything that she said . about him is what she loved about him. As she left, she hugged me and . told me that she loved me.' Testimony is scheduled to resume this morning in state District Judge Ruben Gonzalez's court.

Pilots of an easyJet flight returning to the UK from Prague started take-off forgetting that temporary works had considerably reduced the runway. The pilots of the easyJet Airbus, with 149 passengers aboard, only realised their mistake when they saw the temporary runway end come into view, an accident report said today. The plane approached the works closer than intended on its flight back to Stansted, but managed to take off at planned speeds, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) reported. Budget airline easyJet narrowly avoided disaster in Prague when the pilot did not notice the significantly reduced runway length until take-off was already in progress . In their pre-flight package the crew saw a notice to airmen for Prague airport that works had reduced the runway length from 3,715 metres to 2,500 metres. Before take-off, the pilots had listened to a terminal information broadcast, 'but it was reportedly in heavily-accented English', the AAIB report said. The report went on: 'The pilots had forgotten the content of the notice to airmen.' 'The airport details copied by the co-pilot to the paper flight plan did not contain any reference to the reduced length, and their take-off calculations were based upon take-off using the normal length. 'The commander later attributed the oversight to reduced crew awareness at the end of a lengthy duty period.' The captain also considered that the presence of manuals showing both the normal and reduced lengths of the runway had contributed to the incident. Popular with Brits: passengers returning Prague in the Czech Republic to Stansted did not realise the potential danger of their take-off, but the report said it was a 'serious incident' 'The captain also noted that the crew's pre-flight activities had been interrupted by a visit to the flight deck by an acquaintance and thought that this distraction may also have been a factor.' The AAIB added that the works on the runway were not easily visible to the crew at the start of the take-off and as the aircraft had landed on another runway when reaching Prague the crew had not noticed the works. The captain had noted later that 'there were no warnings from air traffic control or ground signage indicating that the runway length was reduced.'","Calculations for take-off were mistakenly based on the normal runway length .

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS should become paperless within the next five years. However, just 30% of medics thought that publishing medical records online was a good idea, according to a survey conducted by the Medical Protection Society (MPS). Concerns over 'paperless' NHS: Neither patients nor medics are convinced that online records are a good idea . Mr Hunt said the move would save billions of pounds and improve services. Dr Stephanie Bown, director of policy and communications at MPS, said: ""MPS has seen first hand how things can go wrong for patients and doctors when confidential medical information gets into the wrong hands. 'Imagine the teenage girl who has had a termination without her mother knowing or the patient who informs their doctor about abuse at the hands of their partner; if they were to accidentally leave their online record open at home, this could have dire consequences for their relationships and put extra pressure on the doctor to deal with the fallout. 'Patients expect the information they give to their doctor to be kept confidential and if this doesn't happen, it could cause a breakdown in the relationship of trust.

Now a stunning new exhibition at Buckingham Palace demonstrates how Leonardo da Vinci was also one of the most ground-breaking anatomists of all time. Indeed his findings dating from the late 1490s and early 1500s were so revolutionary that some could not be conclusively proved until the development of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scanners in the 1980s, which use radio waves to take detailed pictures of the body. Among the 24 sketches never before seen included a detailed study of the right ventricle and valves of the heart . A closer examination of the right ventricle and tricuspid valve, left, and far right, Da Vinci pens his analysis of the movement inside the heart . Da Vanci explores the vessels of the neck and shoulder, left, and right, the bones and muscles of the shoulder . Da Vinci's fascination with the human . body began through his desire to be 'true to nature' in his paintings . and led him to embark on what can only be described as a campaign of . dissection in hospitals and medical schools throughout Florence. Many of the corpses he worked on were the bodies of executed criminals or those who had no relatives to claim them for burial. He had hoped to publish his findings . in a treatise on anatomy and had he done so, his discoveries would have . transformed European knowledge on the subject. But on his death in 1519, his notes . and drawings remained hidden away amongst his mass of private papers and . effectively lost to the world for 400 years. Arguably his greatest investigations . focus on the workings of the heart - and the artist came tantalisingly . close to discovering the science behind the circulation of blood, a . century before it was officially achieved. According to Royal Collection curator . Martin Clayton, da Vinci became fascinated with a swelling he discovered . at the root of the aorta, just beneath the aortic valve. The brachial plexus, and umbilical vessels, left, and right, the veins of the pelvic and lumbar region . The brachial plexus, left, and right, Da Vinci explores the thetrachea, stomach and right vagus nerve . Leonardo Da Vinci, right, also paid close attention to the abdomen, left, during his extensive analysis of the human anatomy . In order to investigate this he injected melted wax into the heart of an ox in order to make a cast from inside the cavity. He then made a glass model from the . cast which he pumped with water containing a suspension of grass seeds . so that he could witness the 'turbulence' that took place. From his research he deduced that this . swelling was responsible for the closure of the aortic value after each . beat of the heart - a theory which was not suggested again until 1912 . and even then not conclusively confirmed until less than 30 years ago. Another ground-breaking discovery came in the winter of 1508-1509 when da Vinci was present at the death of an old man. He wrote: 'And this old man, a few . hours before his death, told me that he was over 100 years old, and that . he felt nothing wrong with his body other than weakness... And I . dissected him to see the cause of so sweet a death.' Da Vinci then goes on to provide the . first ever description and diagnosis of coronary vascular occlusion - a . partial or complete blockage of an artery to the heart - as well as . arteriosclerosis, or a hardening of the arteries, and cirrhosis of the . liver. The muscles of the trunk and leg, left, and right, the stomach and related structures .

One study illustrating every bone in . the human body is accompanied by 240 individual drawings of astounding . clarity and more than 13,000 words of notes - all in his famed 'mirror . writing'. There has been much debate as to why . da Vinci wrote backwards but most seem to think that it was down to a . combination of him being left handed and dyslexic. Writing in this . manner enabled his hand to move quickly without smudging the ink. 'To say that Leonardo was a man ahead of his time doesn't even come close to describing his genius,' explained Mr Clayton. 'His drawings are among the finest . depictions of the human body ever created. Had he published this work, . he would now be known as one of the greatest scientists in history.' Professor Peter Abrahams, Professor of . Clinical Anatomy at Warwick Medical School, added: 'For me as an . anatomist, what Leonardo did was bring all his disciplines of . architecture, geometry, engineering and combine it with an art . expression that was quite unique. He put all these things together to . try and explain not only how things looked but how things worked, and in . that he was certainly unique.

'If you were to take ten specialists . in the fields of which he worked, geometry, anatomy, physiology, . engineering and architecture, I doubt if ten professors in those fields . would have the knowledge base and talents that Leonardo had.' Da Vinci, who died in 1519, . bequeathed all his notebooks and drawings to his young assistant, . Francesco Melzi, who, over the next 50 years, tried to make sense of his . master's daunting legacy. His son sold on many of the papers to . the sculptor Pompeo Leoni who mounted the anatomical drawings into a . large album which eventually made its way to England and is believed to . have been bought by King Charles II. It has been in the Royal Collection, which is held in trust by The Queen for the nation, since at least 1690.

'showing off' at the wheel of his mother's Citroen C4, a judge heard on Tuesday. Ryan Grace was a week away from joining the police when he lost . control on a bend in Buckinghamshire and slammed sideways into a tree before coming to rest . in a field. Grace was spared jail after admitting causing the death of his 17-year-old friend Hussein Shamshudin by driving carelessly. Ryan Grace, 19, leaving court in Buckinghamshire, after he escaped a prison sentence by admitting that his careless driving cost the life of his friend . The 19-year-old had told his friend Rebecca Smyth, a passenger in the car: ""I'll show you how I drive in Norfolk,"" before accelerating along a country lane. Following the crash Hussein Shamshudin died, Rory Scarlett suffered severe head injuries and Elliot Cartwright was left with a badly wounded arm. Rebecca Smyth was not seriously injured. Hussein's parents told the Buckinghamshire Free Press: 'He has left a big impact on those that loved him dearly. He will be sorely missed now and forever' Rory was in a coma for a month and his mother has had to give up her marketing job at John Lewis to care for him. It was the last day of the insurance cover Grace had on the car and just the week before he had been offered a place with the police, the court was told. That offer was rescinded following his conviction. Judge Francis Sheridan said: 'It is to this man's shame that he did not plead guilty at the earliest opportunity.' Barnaby Shaw, prosecuting, told Aylesbury Crown Court in Buckinghamshire that on February 17 last year Grace had been out with friends at the Feathers public house in Chalfont St Giles. He had not been drinking. They decided to make their way to the Roundabout pub in High Wycombe and set off in two cars. The accident happened on a lane, near the village of Seer Green. Hussein Shamshudin, who was killed by careless driver Ryan Grace had been looking forward to a gap year and university . 'After he had made this [Norfolk driving] comment he appeared to speed up and in the description of Rebecca Smyth seemed to be driving quite fast, accelerating quite a lot, swerving quite a lot around the corners,' said Mr Shaw. 'He was driving too fast for the road conditions and for his ability.' At the pub earlier, Grace had told his friends he had been driving since he was eight, allegedly having learned while staying with his father in Norfolk. Giuseppina Silvio, insisted that the defendant denied the comment while he drove but he accepted that his driving had caused the crash. She described him as 'a broken young man'. 'There can be no greater punishment than Ryan Grace carrying the death of Hussein Shamshudin with him for the rest of his life,' she said. Judge Sheridan told Grace: 'You were showing off.' 'You made the observation 'I'll show you how I drive in Norfolk', or sentiments along those lines. That's not a comment that was invented by a friend seeking revenge.' 'You dropped from the high standards required to pass a test and, if I may say so, from the high standards of your upbringing.' Addressing the court, the judge attacked legal firms who told clients not to answer police questions. He said: 'He knew he was driving too fast, he knew he had caused the death but he made no comment in interview.' 'He was not well served by anybody who was advising him in the police station to go 'no comment'. I make no bones about it.' He read part of a letter from Rory Scarlett's parents, Felix and Laura, in which they said: 'Pleading not guilty was a foolish and wasteful exercise, doomed from the outset.' 'Any professionals responsible for advising him to plead not guilty should hang their heads in shame. They have probably made the situation worse for him.' Turning to Grace, the judge said: 'A friend had lost his life and one was fighting for his and you made no comment.' Despite his criticism, he told Grace he would not be going to prison, at least not immediately. He passed a sentence of 20 weeks in custody, suspended for two years and ordered him to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. He also disqualified Grace, from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, from driving for two-and-a-half years and told him he would have to pass an extended driving test to regain his licence. After sentence the Scarletts said they believed the sentence was fair. Laura Scarlett said her son had made 'a miraculous recovery' after being severely brain damaged.","Driver caused the accident a week before receiving an offer to join the police .

The firm, based in Aberystwyth, says it is responding to complaints about passengers who block the aisles with more than one dog. Audrey Basnett, whose brother regularly travels with his pets, said: ‘There was nothing put up at bus stops to warn people.

Surprise canine fare: Mid Wales Travel justified the charge by saying many passengers bring dogs on their services, and it is only fair they should pay for their extra travellers (stock picture) ‘I’ve been told there are five dogs that go on the buses regularly, but I don’t think that’s enough to start charging.’ Mel Evans, from Mid Wales Travel, . said: ‘We’re not going to charge for guide dogs.

Rachel Weisz cracked open a bottle of ‘quite good red wine’ with her old man Daniel Craig to help celebrate — and get over the shock of — suddenly being hurled into the Oscar race. The actress, who already has a best supporting Academy Award for The Constant Gardener,  was named best actress by the influential New York Film Critics Circle for her role in The Deep  Blue Sea, based on a Fifties Terence Rattigan play about a woman completely overtaken by passion. She prevailed over perceived front-runners Jennifer Lawrence for The  Silver Linings Playbook, Jessica Chastain, star of Zero Dark Thirty, and Marion Cotillard for Rust And Bone. ‘Listen, I’m more shocked, more surprised than anyone. It came out of nowhere,’ Rachel told me from New York,  noting that The Deep Blue Sea opened in America last March in just a handful of cinemas. She and Craig, aka 007, enjoyed sipping the premier vino. ‘It’s  all wintry here, so it’s perfect for red wine.’ In the film, Rachel stars as  Hester Collyer opposite Simon Russell Beale as Sir William  Collyer, the High Court judge husband she abandons for Freddie Page, her lusty RAF pilot lover played by Tom Hiddleston. Rachel gives an electrifying performance as  Hester. ‘She’s someone who falls crazily, madly, deeply in love. She humiliates herself and she’s someone who’s ruled by her heart, soul and her groin,’ Rachel observed. ‘People are going to scorn her and she knows she’s not doing the right thing. I wouldn’t much like that to happen to me, but in drama it’s a very interesting thing to explore.’ She rather admires Hester, a woman ‘who wants to make her life in the way that she chooses to, and I think that’s very brave  and modern’. It’s too early to tell whether the prize in New York will lead to further pre-Oscar trophies. But ‘in practical terms’, the actress said that the win brings about an awareness for a tiny  independent film. It has certainly made Oscar voters pay attention to a portrait of a woman  prepared to lose everything for love. Perhaps Rachel and Daniel should order in a few more choice bottles of red wine just in case. A winning performance: Rachel Weisz portrays Hester Collyer in a scene from The Deep Blue Sea . The Bond movie Skyfall has turned into a cash windfall for director Sam Mendes and the film’s leading actors. Because it has taken so much money globally (more than £543 million in ticket sales so far), Mendes and certain cast members — including James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, baddie Javier Bardem and spy chiefs Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes — are entitled to box-office bonuses said to be in the six-figure range. The director and each of  the actors could end up with $100,000 (£62,000) to $200,000 (£125,000) apiece. There are also awards bonuses, so if any of the actors are nominated for an Oscar, Bafta or Golden Globe, they are rewarded — and they  get more if, perchance, they should win. A Christmas bonus: Bond cast members such as Daniel Craig, pictured left as 007, and Judi Dench pictured right as MI6 head M in Skyfall, are entitled to box-office bonuses because of the success of the film . Box office bonuses kick in after Skyfall reaches a certain figure, say, $200 million and the bonus  accumulates the more Skyfall makes. And as it’s heading towards the billion dollar mark, the bounty will end up being a very tidy sum. Mendes and the actors would have negotiated different deals with producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, so each amount will be different. ‘It’s going to be in the six-figure range for most of them and at the moment the sky’s the limit because it hasn’t stopped taking money,’ an executive in London with knowledge of the arrangement told me. Actors and film-makers sometimes receive a percentage of a film’s revenue. But Broccoli and Wilson never give away slices of their Bond films, only bonuses for a lucky few. Broccoli and Wilson have been fantastic at guiding Bond away from dreariness and they hit the jackpot with Skyfall. Pre-production begins on the next 007 . films, provisionally known as Bond 24 and Bond 25, in the spring. There . has been talk of them shooting back-to-back later next year. In high demand: Director Sam Mendes, centre, talks to Daniel Craig and Ben Whishaw on the set of Skyfall . Mendes is still mulling over whether he will direct them. There’s no official word, but there’s a sense that he might not do them. For starters, he’s directing  the new musical Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which starts previewing at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on May 18 with  Douglas Hodge and Nigel Planer in leading roles. If he directs the Bond double, that would mean he’d have to devote three or four years  to being on 007 duty. He may not fancy that. A lot of changes were being put into the Spice Girls musical Viva Forever last night. I’ve been hearing mixed views during previews, but I know producer Judy Craymer and her creative team will turn the show at the Piccadilly Theatre into a hit. Once upon a time actor Hugh Sachs worked in the National Theatre’s box office. Now he’ll play lawyer Harry Dangle, one of the key parts in the National’s hit comedy One Man, Two Guvnors, when a new cast takes over — led by Rufus Hound — on February 4 at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket. Sachs also appeared in Privates On Parade when Michael Grandage directed it at the Donmar. Grandage has a splendid new production of that show opening on Monday night at the Noel Coward.","Weisz named best actress by New York Film Critics Circle for her role in The Deep  Blue Sea .

Radical plan: Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne could give away shares of the state's stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland . Everyone in Britain could be given Royal Bank of Scotland shares worth hundreds of pounds before the next election, under plans being considered by George Osborne. Senior sources say the Chancellor has decided to offload the State’s 82 per cent stake in the bank before 2015. And Tory ministers believe the most radical solution – simply giving the shares away – has huge political benefits. It would pump more than £30billion into the economy, providing a much-needed boost without the need for pre-election tax cuts. The plan, which is being explored by Sajid Javid, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, would mean a share voucher being sent to everyone with a National Insurance number, or possibly even everyone over the age of 18. Treasury sources say the handout could be worth around £400, but  it might be worth as much as double that. The giveaway could be announced as soon as this year, with bank shares offloaded in 2014. Voters would receive their windfall by January 2015 at the latest. An alternative plan would see the shares sold to taxpayers at a discount, in a reprise of the sell-offs of public utilities pioneered by the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher. The previous government spent £45billion of taxpayers’ money on propping up RBS in 2008. Senior Treasury sources say the Chancellor has abandoned hope of recouping all the costs, with the Government’s shares currently worth just £31billion. However, as this loss has already been factored into the UK’s credit rating, officials believe that giving away the shares would not undermine the Government’s general economic strategy. Business Secretary Vince Cable . proposed a share giveaway in a speech earlier this month in which he . said any hope of privatising the bank at a profit looked like a . ‘distant’ dream. But the revelation that Mr Osborne and Mr Javid are taking the plan seriously will surprise the City. At the helm: Stephen Hester, Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, has told insiders that he will clear most of the bank's toxic assets by 2014 . ‘George has taken the view that he . now wants to get this sorted out before the election,’ a senior figure . said. ‘He has given Sajid pretty wide latitude to sort this out. ‘There . is a realisation that there is no prospect of RBS’s share price rising . to the level at which we bailed the bank out, and it’s not good for the . bank or the Government to hold on to our stake indefinitely. ‘Obviously a giveaway to taxpayers before the election, who after all paid for it in the first place, is very attractive.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable proposed a share giveaway in a speech earlier this month in which he said any hope of privatising the bank at a profit looked like a 'distant' dream . A Tory source said: ‘One of the . options of course could be to put it in our manifesto – but then Labour . could do that as well. Wouldn’t it be much better if voters were getting . a cheque for £400 a few months before election day? It would also be a . very big stimulus.’ Allies . say Mr Osborne has decided he wants to offload the shares due to . frustration at the Government being dragged into a succession of . scandals such as Libor rigging and bankers’ bonuses. Insiders say . Treasury ministers are spending a ‘disproportionate amount of time’ dealing with these issues. ‘What . people don’t understand is that even though we own over 80 per cent of . the bank we can’t just tell them what to do,’ said one. ‘Our only real . power is to sack the whole board, and that wouldn’t exactly inspire . market confidence.’ The Treasury plan has been strengthened by growing confidence that RBS will be ready to sell as early as next year. Chief executive Stephen Hester has told industry insiders that the bank will have cleared most of the toxic assets from its balance sheet by spring 2014. However, experts believe the most likely scenario would see the Government sell a tranche of shares at a loss with the aim of boosting the share price, to give it a better chance of recouping its money by selling the rest. Although he plans to sell the RBS stake, Mr Osborne has no immediate plans to offload the Government’s 40 per cent slice of Lloyds. This is because the bank concentrates on high street business rather than controversial investments.","George Osborne could decide to give away RBS shares before 2015 .

A major travel insurance firm is refusing to cover skiers not wearing a helmet on the slopes this winter. Essential Travel claims to be the first British firm to adopt such a policy as part of their safety campaign, launched after the death of Liam Neeson’s wife, actress Natasha Richardson who died after an apparent minor fall on the slopes in 2009. It is thought that other insurers may now follow suit, adopting similar policies. Killed by minor fall: A travel insurance firm is refusing to cover skiers without helmets after the 2009 death of Natasha Richardson (pictured with husband Liam Neeson) Ms Richardson, 45, died after sustaining a head injury during a skiing lesson at the Mont Tremblant resort in Canada. She was not wearing a helmet at the time and her death prompted a debate about ski safety with some experts calling for head protection to become mandatory. About 77 per cent of British skiers claim to wear a helmet on the slopes, up from 62 per cent in 2010 according to an Essential Travel survey. Spokesman Stuart Bensusan said: ‘Whilst it is true that a helmet does not reduce all sports injury, it seriously reduces the risk of potentially fatal injuries. Not wearing a helmet: Ms Richardson had the fall at the Mont Tremblant resort (pictured) in Canada during a skiing lesson in 2009 . Reduces risk: About 77 per cent of British skiers claim they wear a helmet, up from 62 per cent in 2010 . ‘That alone warrants making wearing helmets compulsory and we choose to completely support safety-conscious skiers by rewarding them with reduced premiums and bonus discounts.’ The company admitted that while it may not always be able to prove whether or not a customer had been wearing a helmet, it would examine medical records and doctors’ notes for clues. The firm’s campaign, Use Your Head, has been backed by several tour operators and charities including Headway, Ellis Brigham, and Neilson, with several firms offering discounts on holidays if they book insurance through Essential Travel. Peter McCabe, chief executive of brain injury association . Headway, said: ‘There is a general misconception that only a major . impact will lead to death or disability from a head injury. ‘However, the truth of the matter is that sometimes even minor bangs to the head can have serious consequences.’ Biggest factor: Excessive drinking has been identified as one of the biggest factors behind skiing accidents . Karyn Climans, from Tail-Wags helmet covers said: 'Wearing a safety helmet while skiing, biking, skating and tobogganing is as important as wearing a safety belt while driving. 'Even if you're an experienced skier or cyclist, it only takes 30 seconds of distraction or some other careless person on the slopes to cause serious injury.' Insure&Go and Direct Travel Insurance confirmed that their customers were not currently required to wear a helmet but would not comment on whether they were due to amend their policies. Previously, skiers were warned that they could invalidate their insurance if they were found to be under the influence of alcohol on the slopes.

Houshang Jafari, a self-styled lord, had moved his 33-year-old lover into his £1.2million flat saying he was allowed a second wife under Sharia law. The couple had married in Iran in 1978 and in all that time Mr Jafari, 60, had never told his wife that he loved her. Aghdas Bidaki (left) the wife of Lord Houshang . Jafari, arrives at court, along with her husband's mistress Katrina - . who has dubbed herself Lady Jafari (right) Instead he would leave her and their three children for days at a time while he had relationships with other women, Bristol County Court was told. The court heard that the property developer had now moved out of the family home in Downleaze, Bristol, to be with his mistress, Katrina, in his luxury apartment in the city's historic Dower House. It was claimed his lover now uses the title 'Lady Jafari', but is not legally married to him. Giving evidence, Miss Bidaki, 53, who uses her maiden name, claimed Mr Jafari moved out of their home after moaning about her cooking. She claimed she previously ignored his womanising, but could not overlook the fact that Katrina was pregnant again. She said: 'He had other relationships but I put up with it for the sake of my marriage. I put up with it because my family would say it would pass and once he was older and wiser it would be fine. 'What I didn't know was that this time it was serious. There was a two-year-old boy and she was pregnant with another. Then I realised I am not going to put up with it. I could not compete with a woman 20 years younger than myself. He didn't care about me.' Miss Bidaki said she had wanted to divorce him before, but under Sharia law she would not have been able to take her three children with her. Mr Jafari later agreed to buy her a three-bedroom house, a car and pay her a monthly amount. Houshang Jafari is waging a bitter war with his wife, who is attempting to divorce him for making his young mistress pregnant for a second time . But she claims the cash stopped coming and the house never materialised. She said she then received notice that their family home was no longer owned by them because Mr Jafari had used it to secure a loan. Miss Bidaki told the court she feared she could become homeless – while her husband lives in luxury. However Mr Jafari denied her claims. He said: 'What she is saying is being orchestrated by the children.' She is saying it so she can get them money. That is the purpose of this divorce.' He admitted never telling his wife that he loved her. In reply, Miss Bidaki said: 'My love was unconditional love. When I was married to my husband I was 19. 'He would go out and be gone for days and come home in a different shirt. I was not able to sleep at night. He was cheating all the way through the 35 years many times. I said “I love you” but my real love was keeping my marriage and continuing my job being a housewife.' Mr Jafari hit the headlines in 2010 when he was jailed for a year for attacking a helicopter that had landed outside his flat. The businessman flew into a rage because the Jet Ranger blew debris at his Land Rover.

Claims: Sandra Brown believes her late father murdered schoolgirl Moira Anderson in 1957 . The daughter of a man linked to the disappearance of a schoolgirl more than 50 years ago has described her father as 'every bit as much of a paedophile as Jimmy Savile'. Moira Anderson, 11, went missing from her home in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, in February 1957 while running an errand for her grandmother. It is widely believed that she was abducted and murdered, but her body has never been found. The case remains unsolved, but Sandra Brown believes her late father, convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, murdered the little girl and dumped her body in a grave at Old Monkland Cemetery. At . the graveyard, forensic experts have started exhuming the family plot . of Sinclair Upton, said to be an acquaintance of Gartshore, in a bid to . find Moira’s remains. Bus driver Gartshore died in 2006. Mrs Brown told BBC Scotland: 'My father was every bit as much of a paedophile as Jimmy Savile ever was. 'My . sad conclusion is that Moira is not the only child in the central belt . of Scotland who suffered this fate. Whether we find her or not, we know . we’ve looked. I hope to see results in the next few days.' She said it was her belief that there was a 'paedophile ring' in operation in the area at the time of Moira's disappearance. Schoolgirl: Bus driver Alexander Gartshore has been linked to the disappearance of Moira Anderson, who vanished in 1957 at the age of 11 . Search: Police at Old Monkland Cemetery in Coatbridge, Scotland, where a grave site was opened as part of the search for the schoolgirl's remains . Mrs Brown previously blamed Gartshore for Moira’s murder in her book Where There Is Evil. The excavation is being led by Professor Sue Black and a team from the forensic anthropology department at Dundee University. Police believe the burial plot has three layers with up to eight people interred there, and experts are exploring the possibility that Moira’s body may have been dumped under a coffin in the grave, which was thought to have been open around the time of her disappearance. Allegations: Sandra Brown has compared her late father Alexander Gartshore to paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile . The operation comes after a sheriff gave police the go-ahead last month following a petition at Airdrie Sheriff Court from the Moira Anderson Foundation. The foundation, started in 2000 by Mrs Brown to support children and adults affected by sexual abuse, campaigned for further investigations into Moira’s disappearance and last year Scotland’s Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland ordered cold case detectives to reopen the case as a murder. A large section of the cemetery has been cordoned off with police tape, with a large black tent and a series of smaller blue tents erected around the excavation site.

Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef is serving a life sentence at the ADX supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, for masterminding the 1993 World Trade Center bombing . The convicted terrorist who planned and carried out the 1993 World Trade Center bombing - who has been in isolation for more than a decade - has filed a lawsuit to end his solitary confinement. Ramzi Yousef, 45, has been imprisoned since his capture in Pakistan in 1995 - two years after he killed six people and injured 1,000 others after detonating explosives beneath the North Tower. Since the September 11 attacks, the 45-year-old Pakistani national has . been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the . federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies.' Yousef says that despite good . behavior while behind bars, he remains in solitary solely because he is a . terrorist - which he claims is a violation of his due process rights. In . a letter to the prison's warden obtained by the Los Angeles Times, Yousef says: 'I . request an immediate end to my solitary confinement and ask to be in a . unit in an open prison environment where inmates are allowed outside . their cells for no less than 14 hours a day.' 'I have been in solitary confinement in the U.S. since February 8, . 1995, with no end in sight... I further ask not to be in handcuffs or . leg irons when moved outside my cell.' The Times reports that Yousef doesn't even see the prison's guards, who push his meals through a small slot between two steel doors. The only other inmate within the sound of his voice is reportedly a man who has killed others while incarcerated. In August, Yousef's attorney Bernard Kleinman said his client wanted out of solitary because he was 'lonely' - and claimed that despite the World Trade Center attack, the 1994 bombing . of a Philippine jet, a plot to kill Pope John Paul II and other plots - Yousef is 'no longer a threat.' Isolation: Since the September 11 attacks, Yousefl has been in solitary confinement in a 7-foot-by-11-foot cell at the federal ADX supermax prison in Colorado, which is known as 'the Alcatraz of the Rockies' Damage: This is the hole that was blown in the basement of the World Trade Center by the truck bomb Yousef detonated . Catastrophic: Yousef had hoped the bomb blast would collapse the one tower into the other and bring both crumbling down . 'I think it's just plain unfair,' Kleinman said outside court at the time. 'Most of the terrorists he knew are either dead or in jail.' Yousef was sentenced to life in prison . after he was convicted in the World Trade Center attack, as well as a plot to bomb 12 American . airliners over the Far East. At his 1998 sentencing, Yousef defiantly proclaimed: 'Yes, I am a terrorist and am proud of it.' His uncle is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11 terror atrocities that destroyed the World Trade Center towers and left nearly 3,000 people dead. Wounded: More than 1,000 people were injured in the World Trade Center attack . Terrorist: Ramzi Yousef bragged that he was a terrorist at his sentencing in 1998. Now he says he's lonely . He fled to the Middle East the night of the . bombing and was captured two years later in Pakistan, where he was . turned over to the FBI. He now lives in a 7-foot by 11-foot cell with a . radio, a television, a desk, a toilet and a shower, Kleinman said. Since . 1997, he has been subjected to special administrative measures reserved . for prisoners who are believed to be a continuing threat to the . country. The restrictions prevent Yousef from . communicating with other prisoners and only allow him to meet with his . lawyer, Kleinman said. For those visits, Yousef is shackled and forced to communicate through . Plexiglass. The prison is also home to Unabomber Ted . Kaczynski, Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nicholas, .

Sweden over sex assault allegations but believes it is part of a plot . to put him on trial in the U.S. over the leaking of classified documents . on his website. He said if he is elected to the senate then America and Britain - where he skipped bail in relation to the accusations before seeking political refuge - would back down, fearing an international showdown. In Australia, senators must take up their seats within two months of being elected and Assange is confident this is enough to secure a safe passage out of the UK. He told Australian website The Conversation: 'The Senate could vote to evict me, but that would trigger a big political row. 'Australians probably wouldn't swallow it. They've learned a lesson from the controversial dismissal of Gough Whitlam.' He said Britain would allow him to leave otherwise 'the political costs of the current standoff will be higher still'. Escape: Assange believes election will secure his safe passage out of the UK . Fugitive: The WikiLeaks founder before skipping bail and seeking refuge . Assange's supporters have applied for him to be placed on the electoral roll in Victoria, which is necessary for all senate candidates. He said he will start the WikiLeaks political party, with several candidates running in the election, and added he is 'sure' it would attract the required 500 fee-paying members. Assange also claimed the allegations against him are 'falling apart'. He revealed his plans as the President Correa declared victory in the presidential elections. The president said: 'It's a diplomatic situation for which a solution must be found... as quickly as possible...his fate' is in Europe's hands.' Assange, whose anti-secrecy website is responsible for the biggest security breach in U.S. history, fled to the embassy in June. Victorious: Rafael Correra declared victory in Ecuador's presidential elections and said Europe must solve the 'Julian Assange' problem . Re-election: Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa celebrates his victory today . Celebrations: Supporters of Rafael Correa parade in the streets of Quito . The country granted him asylum in August but Britain has refused to allow him safe passage out of the country. By helping him, Ecuador 'did what it had to do in the framework of its sovereignty,' Correa said. 'There can't be a problem due to asylum, it's neocolonialism,' he said. Correa claimed victory shortly after polling stations closed in an election he had been widely expected to win. The first official results polls gave him 56.7 percent of the vote -- and a roughly 30-point lead over his nearest rival, banker Guillermo Lasso -- with just over a third of ballots counted. It has also emerged that the bill for policing outside the embassy in London has reached nearly £3 million.","He believes election will secure safe passage from UK .

Two may be company, but – as the Duchess of Cornwall discovered yesterday – three is most definitely a crowd. The 64-year-old was left looking a little lost on the sidelines as the Dalai Lama chatted and held hands with his ‘best friend’ Prince Charles during an informal meeting at Clarence House. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, who is on a ten-day tour of Britain, spent much of the next hour praising the Prince of Wales. Friendship: The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader also urged Charles to carry on his work . Praise: His kind words came after the prince, the Duchess of Cornwall and the spiritual figurehead held an informal meeting at Clarence House for around an hour . The 71-year-old said: ‘I always . consider him a very close, best of friends. Right from the beginning, I . felt “very nice person, good human”. He (has) proved a very wonderful, . sensible, good human being.’ However, the duchess soon got a look . in – she took the pair to see a magnolia spectrum tree the Dalai Lama . planted in the royal garden during a visit in 2008. He also urged Charles to carry on his . work and in touching scenes the pair held hands, touched heads and . patted each other on the back during their time together. The spiritual figurehead, who had grasped Charles' right hand, stopped in front of the waiting media and said about the Prince: 'I always consider him from my first meeting, a very close, best of friends' Tour: The Tibetan spiritual leader is on a 10-day tour of Britain with a mission to spread his Buddhist teachings of peace and understanding to youngsters . Guide tour: Camilla stood slightly away from the pair as they looked around the gardens . Meeting: Clarence House would not release details of the discussions, only saying: 'It is a private meeting, the Prince of Wales sees the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader' The two men have obviously built up a strong rapport and at one point the Dalai Lama affectionately stroked the underside of the prince's chin making him laugh. He also touched heads with the heir to the throne, another sign of how close the pair have become over the years. Since the Prince last met the exiled . spiritual leader he has held discussions with China's president Hu . Jintao, raising the subject of Tibet during talks in London in 2009. The . senior Buddhist figure arrived at Clarence House in a chauffeur-driven . car and as he stepped into the doorway of the historic home the heir to . throne appeared. Visit: The royal couple took the Dalai Lama to see the magnolia spectrum tree he planted in the royal residence's garden following their last meeting in 2008 . Friends: The pair looked to be in good spirits as they spoke to the media holding hands . Charles threw up his arms then placed his hands together in a prayer sign before hugging the Dalai Lama and sharing a few words with the spiritual figurehead. Waiting next to the prince was Camilla, who kissed the exiled Buddhist leader before the group moved into the house's garden room for their informal chat. The Tibetan spiritual leader is on a 10-day tour of Britain with a mission to spread his Buddhist teachings of peace and understanding to youngsters. Clarence House would not release details of the discussions, only saying: 'It is a private meeting, the Prince of Wales sees the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader.' But it is likely they discussed the latest situation in Tibet and spiritual matters. The Dalai Lama went on a brief tour of the Clarence House gardens and met around 80 of Charles' household staff who gathered to see the international figure. Before leaving he touched foreheads with Camilla, and Charles again clasped his hands in front of himself before the royal couple waved the spiritual leader off.","The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader also urged Charles to carry on his work .

Spared jail: Liam Ferrar, outside Leicester Magistrates Court, has been sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for a year for leaving a severed pig's head outside a Muslim place of worship . An office worker who left a severed pig's head outside a Muslim place of worship on Boxing Day has been spared jail. Liam Ferrar, 24, was sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment, suspended for a year, after a court heard he was disgusted by his actions and had written a letter of apology to his victims. Ferrar, of Leicester, pleaded guilty last month to causing religiously aggravated harassment by leaving the frozen pig's head on the steps of the city's Thurnby Lodge Community Centre. Sentencing Ferrar at Leicester Magistrates' Court, District Judge John Temperley described the offence as being 'to some extent planned, premeditated and targeted'. The district judge told Ferrar: 'You were well aware of the significance of your actions. 'You knew that what you did would cause great distress, indeed that was your intention.' The court heard that Ferrar was under the influence of alcohol when he placed the pig's head - which had been stored in a freezer for several months - in an area where it could not be avoided by adults and children arriving for prayers. Stressing that the offence had taken place against a background of protests at the community centre's use as a place-of-worship, District Judge Temperley added: 'It is easy to imagine the shock, distress and disgust (those who discovered the pig's head) would have felt. 'The witnesses statements I have read bear testimony to the serious impact of your actions, but the harm you caused goes further. 'Others in the local community and beyond would also have been affected when news of this incident spread, prompting profound alarm, fear and insecurity. 'It should have been obvious that what you did was intimidatory and would only serve to enflame an already tense and volatile situation.' Ferrar pleaded guilty last month to causing religiously aggravated harassment by leaving the frozen pig's head (pictured) on the steps of the city's Thurnby Lodge Community Centre . Suspending the 12-week prison term because of Ferrar's personal mitigation, including his previous good character, the district judge accepted that the defendant regularly gave his time and energy to local good causes. District Judge John Temperley described the offence as being 'to some extent planned, premeditated and targeted' District Judge Temperley told Ferrar, who was also ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid community work and pay £85 in costs: 'The character references I have read do you great credit. 'I also accept that you have demonstrated genuine remorse and regret for your actions. You co-operated with the police and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.' Louise Cox, prosecuting, told the court a group calling itself Forgotten Estates had stepped up protests at the community centre last summer. Defence solicitor Stephen Morris said the protest group, of which Ferrar was a member, aimed to highlight the lack of facilities in the Thurnby Lodge area. Claiming that his client had chosen to distance himself from Forgotten Estates in September last year, Mr Morris said: 'The behaviour by Mr Ferrar on this occasion is out of character - he is not somebody who displays racist tendencies.'","Liam Ferrar left a frozen pig's head outside community centre .

A father-of-three was shamed into taking drastic action over his weight after humiliating day out with his children at Legoland. Pete Cavender was riding the log flume when his 23-stone bulk weighed down the ride so heavily that it wouldn't move in the fast-moving water. While his friends couldn't help but laugh, Pete, 37, was forced to stand up and shunt the log along the sides of the slide to get to the end of the ride. Dramatic transformation: After getting stuck on the log flume, Pete Cavender, 37, lost an impressive eight stone . And while the former engineer tried to laugh too, it a serious wake-up call - if he didn't lose weight fast he would be in serious trouble. He said: 'The log just got stuck. It was supposed to get rushed along by all the fast-moving water but it just got jammed, largely because of my weight. 'Everyone was watching us and having a giggle and, to hide my embarrassment, I joined in with the joke. 'But deep down I was mortified, particularly as all my daughters were there. Sleeping off lunch: Before Pete lost weight, he'd happily feast on large portions of fast food . 'We had no choice but to push the log along just to get off the ride. I couldn’t wait to get off.' Pete, from Maidstone, Kent, had been over-eating for years and would think nothing of gorging on a 10-piece family bucket at KFC. His weight had ballooned as he travelled around the south-east in his job as an engineer. 'I was in my van a lot and I would just live off snacks from bakeries, McDonalds and my beloved KFC,' he said. 'I had played a lot of sport - rugby and cricket in particular - but gradually I became more susceptible to injuries as my weight shot up. 'In the end, the only trousers I had in my wardrobe were jogging bottoms - because I knew the waists would stretch. 'I had a 48-inch waist and I knew that if I didn't lose weight and radically change my lifestyle I was going to run into serious health problems.' The scene of the crime: Pete and his friends ride the log flume where he later got stuck . After getting wedged, Pete realised it was time to do something about his 48-inch waist . Pete started exercising again regularly - swimming a mile at a time because a session in the pool put less strain on his joints than other sports. And he began to count every calorie he ate using an app on his phone. 'I relished my new lifestyle. I started making my own bread - instead of using sugar I would use sweetener. 'A typical slice of bread has more than 120 calories - mine had around 55. The weight began to fall off me.' He also took Forza Raspberry Ketone diet pills - first made popular by Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey. They are said to work by suppressing the appetite and giving users an energy rush through caffeine which increases resting metabolism - allowing users to burn more calories even when they are not exercising. Pete said: 'I work as engineer - I like to know how things work. I took the same attitude to my weight loss - looking at all the factors which had caused my weight to balloon. 'I knew that I needed to change my diet and start a regular regime of exercise. Then and now: Thanks to ditching his beloved fast food and a new fitness regime the weight fell off Pete . 'The diet pills were also a really . important step. They worked for me in the same way patches work for a . smoker who is looking to give up. 'They gave me that extra impetus I needed.They helped me to stop wanting food. 'Some people say that using diet pills is cheating. 'They don't just work on their own: you need to combine them with a good diet and regular exercise . 'I soon found that I was full up eating half what I had done before. He lost three stone in the first three months and has shed eight stone since that fateful day at Legoland. His weight has gone down from 23 stone to under 15 stone and he has around two stone to go reach what he feels will be his ideal weight. Pete's weight loss has helped him transformed his life and allowed him to cuddle his daughters again for the first time in years. He said: 'They tell me now, ""Dad, we can get our arms around you again.""' They are looking forward to going back to Legoland this summer. 'I’ll go straight back to the log flume,' he explained. 'And this time I won’t get stuck.'","Pete Cavender, 37, thought nothing of scoffing 10-piece family bucket at KFC .

Cuddle: TV presenter Lizzie Cundy pictured with chancellor George Osborne at the Winter Ball . The Dom Perignon flowed like water at £100 a bottle, served in blue glass flutes which matched the azure carpet and the collars of the mandarin jackets worn by the silver-service waiters. But the Conservatives’ £400-a-head winter ball, once the social highlight of the party’s year, was meant to be a private affair. All the same there was not much sign of recession. Around 600 guests arrived at the glass-roofed ballroom of the Hurlingham Club in West London — where the dress code was ‘winter glamour’: black tie for men and floor-length ball gowns for the women. But not quite so low-key for when ordinary club members complained about being unable to get in the entrance because of all the Rolls-Royces and Daimlers clogging the drive. They were airily informed by staff: ‘We’ve been told not to say anything.’ With an eye, no doubt, on last night’s vote, David Cameron, dressed in a lounge suit, made a speech about how the Tories had modernised and were no longer the party of privilege. ‘It was brilliant,’ says TV presenter Lizzie Cundy, who cuddled Chancellor George Osborne and tackled the PM about gay marriage. ‘I had brought a gay friend, Nick Ede, and was determined to speak to Cameron about gay marriage and introduce him because he wants to get married,’ says Lizzie, ex-wife of Chelsea footballer Jason Cundy. ‘The Prime Minister was very encouraging so I kissed him on the cheek to say thank you.’ Cameron’s egalitarian theme was somewhat at odds with the opulence of the party, where guests included property magnates Nick Candy and Bruce Ritchie and an auction where one wealthy supporter paid £100,000 for a painting of the PM. Grand venue: 600 guests were invited to the Hurlingham Club in London for the Conservative's Winter Ball . Tables were laden with vases of . ivory-coloured roses and lilies and the menu included goat’s cheese with . beetroot, lamb in samphire and strawberry mousse. But perhaps the most significant feature was Cameron’s speech. ‘Not everyone stood to applaud,’ I am told. Beards, almost extinct at Parliament under Thatcher and Blair — both hated facial hair — are making a comeback. The latest MP to have sprouted is Wiltshire North Tory James Gray, who has returned from a research trip to Antarctica bewhiskered. ‘I am going for the George V look,’ laughs Gray, stroking his furry chops. Impressive though his three-week growth is, Gray has some way to go before matching W. G. Grace lookalike Lib Dem Viscount Thurso. For all this there are no beards in Cabinet. Though that is not to say high office is not a hairy place. While the cake-baking brother of the Duchess of Cambridge has his heart set on building up his own successful business empire, it seems that James Middleton still has a little way to go. The latest set of accounts for a company set up by Middleton, 25, show it was far from being in profit at the end of its first financial year and had debts of more than £24,000. But an entry in the accounts for his grandly named Nice Group London Ltd suggests there is no need to panic — his debts are guaranteed by a relative. ‘The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director’s family,’ says the note. In an interview last year, Marlborough-educated Middleton said that he wanted to be known for standing on his own two feet, and added: ‘Nothing is handed to anyone on a plate’. He set up his first business selling ingredients for people to make their own cakes at home in 2007. It now operates through his parents’ Party Pieces website from premises next door to their business in Berkshire. The accounts for Nice Group London for the year up to the end of last April show it had debts of £32,575 owing to creditors. After the deduction of stocks worth £3,320 and money owed from debtors of £5,151, it had net current liabilities of £24,104. Last heard of working in a Brighton cake shop, former TV presenter Annabel Giles is unlikely to tuck into pastries in future, well not if she heeds the advice of her bank. She claims staff there told her to ‘eat less food’. While that might be good advice for someone overweight, pencil-slim Annabel, ex-wife of rock star Midge Ure and a former face of Max Factor, was not impressed. Cutting costs: Annabel Giles was told by her bank she could cut her outgoing by eating less food . Annabel , 53, who has a daughter by Midge and a teenage son by another relationship, says: ‘I have just agreed to part company with Nationwide after over 30 years. Having frozen my accounts I was told by an “adviser” to cut my outgoings by eating less food.’ Nationwide says: ‘We can’t comment on individuals, but if someone had gone over their agreed overdraft it would be a reason to freeze the account. We would give them an expenditure sheet and there would be questions about their outgoings including the cost of any mortgage and household bills, including food.’ Adored by London’s right-on critics, architect Lord (Norman) Foster is not quite so revered in New York, where his plans for Manhattan’s public library, which featured in the film Breakfast At Tiffany’s, have attracted opprobrium. Michael Kimmelman, of the New York Times, says: ‘The designs have all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall. ‘What results is an awkward, cramped,  banal pastiche of tiers facing claustrophobia-inducing windows, built around a space-wasting atrium with a curved staircase more suited to a Las Vegas hotel. I’m not buying it.’ Turning to one of Foster’s London projects, Kimmelman adds: ‘I am reminded that he is also responsible for the canopied enclosure of the inner court at the British Museum, a pompous waste of public space that inserts a shopping gallery into the heart of a sublime cultural institution.’ These are tough times for Bianca Jagger. The former wife of Rolling Stone Mick is in Nicaragua to tie up the affairs of her brother Carlos, who has died unexpectedly. Bianca cut short a conference on ocean pollution with Prince Albert of Monaco to dash to Carlos’s hospital bedside in Los Angeles when he was taken ill. ‘Bianca is devastated,’ a friend tells me. ‘She and Carlos were very close growing up in Managua, where their father was a diplomat.’ Bianca’s daughter Jade, is said to have been a considerable comfort to her mother. Apropos the Tory winter ball, David Cameron made a beeline for louche club owner Peter Stringfellow. Shaking 72-year-old Stringy’s hand, Cameron told him: ‘I see you are taking on Nick Clegg,’ — a reference to my item last week about Stringfellow’s threat to stand against the Lib Dem leader if he made another reference to his taking the pensioners’ Winter Fuel Allowance. ‘David was very jovial and joked with Peter that he could provide some tips for handling Clegg,’ I am told.","£400-a-head winter ball was held at the Hurlingham Club in West London .

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 05:10 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 16 January 2013 . Heart-breaking: Zane was diagnosed when he was one . The parents of a young boy with a deadly and extremely rare brain condition are trying to raise £5,000 so that he can have crucial treatment in America. Little Zane Smith, who is four, suffers from CCM3, which causes cavernomas, or oversized blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that can lead to life-threatening strokes or seizures. Zane has already had one stroke and is likely to have more, so his parents want to fly him to America to see the world authority on the disorder. Dr Issam Awad runs a highly-rated clinic in Chicago that offers specialised MRI scans to assess the permeability, or leakiness, of the blood vessels. He is an authority on the rare genetic mutation that is known to affect fewer than 100 people in the world. Zane lives in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with his parents Kim, 38, Lee, 39, and sisters Keira, 15, and Lily, eight. His family is now campaigning to raise the money needed to fly him to Chicago for treatment for the condition that was diagnosed shortly after Zane's first birthday. Mr Smith said: 'Last night he was sobbing because of a pain in his leg due to his condition. 'Sometimes he says ""My head hurts now, let's go to the doctors"". 'That's totally heartbreaking for us all.' There is no known cure for the genetic condition that could kill Zane at any time.  Treatment at Dr Awad's clinic offers Zane the best chance of living as long as possible. Mrs Smith said: 'Zane needs to be watched constantly as the condition affects his balance, his body movement, and his behaviour. 'I call it the Jekyll and Hyde condition - one moment he can be fine and happy, the next Zane has turned into a monster. Fund-raising: Lee Smith need to raise £5,000 to take his son to see the world authority in CCM3 . 'On Saturday night we were at some friends being fairly active and then he came over to me to say his head hurt and within seconds he was asleep. 'Zane can be randomly sick, have no energy at all, and lie on the sofa.  Next minute, he can be all right and active.' The condition is caused by a mutation on the CCM3 gene, and was only identified in 2005. It means that Zane can be vacant, twitch, and suffer from pains caused by the multiple cavernomas, or clusters of blood vessels, micro-haemorrhaging. Mrs Smith said: 'The importance of the scan is that we can manage Zane's condition when things are not going well. So brave: Little Zane Smith, left, has had brain scans here, right, but needs to fly to the US for specialised help . 'The type of MRI used is not available in the UK.  It will show where the cavernomas are, how likely they are to haemorrhage, and what the side-effects of the bleeds could be. 'It means that if Zane had a stroke the doctors could tell fairly quickly which of the cavernomas had haemorrhaged.' Zane's father said the boy has a 50 per cent chance of having a major stroke before he reaches 15. If he flies to Chicago to be seen by Dr Awad, his doctors in the UK would then be able to call on the US doctor's expertise at any time. A scan taken at Hinchingbrooke Hospital when Zane was first diagnosed highlighted 15 cavernomas in his brain, and further tests last year showed two more had developed. Fifty per cent of patients with the condition begin having brain haemorrhages as children, and Zane falls into this category. Connie Lee founded the Angioma Alliance, which established the clinic in Chicago that has offered anyone suffering from CCM3 to have a scan and consultation. Dr Lee said: 'Very little is known about CCM3 - the gene was discovered as recently as 2005 and the fact that this is an ultra-rare disorder was not clear until 2011. 'Because of this, the medical community is not familiar with management of the illness.' She added: 'Zane has already had a brain haemorrhage.  He has at least 17 brain lesions and this number is expected to increase. 'Hence the need for Dr Awad's expert management.' Mr and Mrs Smith and their daughters are trying to raise funds through bag-packing, skydiving, a football match and an autumn ball. They have set up a Just Giving page to encourage people to donate so they can raise enough to pay for them to take Zane to Chicago. The £5,000 target will pay for flights, accommodation, the scan and a consultation with Dr Awad.  If more than £5,000 is raised, the surplus will go to the charity Cavernoma Alliance UK. Supporters who would like to get behind Zane and his parents are invited to make donations at www.justgiving.com/helpzane .","Zane Smith has CCM3, a genetic mutation that could kill him at any time .

The calm father of two, 42, from Maida Vale, London, fished it out, dried it off and got straight on the phone to maker Kellogg's. Nasty taste: Mark Hunter was about to take a second mouthful of rice krispies when this dead mouse bobbed to the surface . 'I was horrified because I’d already had one mouthful and was about to have a second,' he told the Mirror. 'I saw this dark shape appear in the milk, but I didn’t realise what it was until I fished it out with my spoon.' Kellogg's have admitted they are horrified by what has happened and will be heading to Mr Hunter's home to pick up the mouse and find out where it came from. Experts from the University of Liverpool believe they can work out its origin. Calm: Mr Hunter took the mouse out, dried it off and called Kellogg's - who are coming to collect it and work out where it came from . Spokesman Paul Wheeler said it was an 'extremely rare' case, adding: 'We are devastated and will be investigating fully.'

Faking it: A third of men admit to hiring or borrowing items such as sports cars and fancy clothes to impress women on a date . Their efforts might be worth it however, as more than 40 per cent of women agree that the car a person drives can make them more attractive, while nearly 60 per cent agreed that a swish outfit would impress them. Other lengths that men would go to included renting a house or apartment and even taking on a temporary pet to play up their emotional side.

New sat-nav technology will tell drivers how much to adjust their speed to sail through uninterrupted green lights. The project, masterminded by academics at Newcastle University, is being developed to ease traffic jams, as well as cut the pollution caused by start-stop driving. Set for trials in Newcastle and a range of other European cities, the system will set a particular speed to ensure vehicles hit the next four sets of traffic lights before they turn to red. Soon to be a thing of the past: Newcastle is to . trial a new sat-nav technology which will help drivers avoid heavy . traffic and could even tell them how fast to drive to avoid getting . caught by red lights . Phil Blythe, professor of intelligent transport systems at Newcastle, said: 'What's unique about this trial is that we will be giving information directly to the driver. 'For example, the system might advise a driver that if they travel at 24 miles an hour they will hit the next four sets of traffic lights on green. 'In more congested areas or particularly busy times of the day, then key roads might be given priority in order to keep the traffic flowing.' Two other benefits of the system will be a forward collision warning and a red light violation warning, which tells drivers when someone has jumped a red light. 'Unique': Phil Blythe, professor of intelligent . transport systems at Newcastle University, is one of the academics . behind the £8.6million scheme . The pilot is part of a £8.6million project called Compass4D involving Newcastle and six other European cities. Dr Yvonne Huebner, from Newcastle University, who is leading the project in the UK, said: 'Newcastle is already leading the way in intelligent transport systems and this work will allow us to build on the infrastructure that is already in place to provide personalised information to drivers. 'Every year there are more cars on the road and although there are initiatives in place to keep our cities moving congestion is still a major problem. 'And it’s not just car drivers. By creating a joined-up information system for all road users we can give other users such as the emergency services and bus drivers information which can help them get to their destination quickly and safely.' The new project will link an in-vehicle communication system directly with the Newcastle’s Urban Traffic Management Control centre. Information collected by the centre will be sent directly to drivers,  warning them away from jams to speed up journeys through the city and ease traffic congestion. At the same time, drivers can also be warned of approaching danger such as an accident or reckless driver. Among the systems being implemented by the team are: .

Escaped jail: Rachel Hall was given a suspended sentence after driving her car at a group of special needs pupils who throw snowballs at her car . A woman who drove her car at a group of special needs children when they threw snowballs at her vehicle has been spared jail. Motorist Rachel Hall mounted the kerb and drove her car at two boys among a group of pupils who had run into the street and launched snowballs at the passing vehicle. A court heard Hall did not hit the pupils but came back along the road a short time later, drove onto the playing field where the youngsters were and into a girl, who had been making a snowball. The girl was taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries to her calf and foot. Hall, a mother-of-five, admitted dangerous driving at an earlier hearing but denied striking or injuring the girl, and was given a three month jail term, which was suspended for one year. The court heard the pupils from Priory Hurworth House School in Darlington, a specialist school for seven to 19-year-old's with complex learning difficulties, had skipped class on February 6 last year. Teachers had tracked them down to Westfield Drive and were trying to get them back to school when they targeted Hall, who was taking her youngest child to nursery school. Prosecutor Rachel Masters told Teesside Crown Court: 'The defendant shouted out of the window, . 'Are you supposed to be in control of them?' Teacher Jason Todd apologised and explained that staff were trying to get the pupils back to school. Ms Masters added: 'The defendant's car mounted the kerb and the engine started revving.' Teachers described seeing Hall's Renault Scenic wheel spinning and heading for the two boys. A short while later, Hall drove back along the road with her then 17-year-old. The court was told she again mounted the kerb before driving onto the field and into the girl.

One Tokyo restaurant that specialises in French cuisine is spearheading a filthy new food fad and has launched a full course menu of dishes all made with dirt. Courses include potato starch and dirt soup and dirt dressed salad ... there's even a dirt ice cream. Getting the dirt on a new food trend: Potato starch and dirt soup served in a shot glass with slice of black truffle . Not only does this sound like a torturous exercise, but to eat this restaurant's dirty offerings you'll have to make reservations at least a week in advance due to high demand. And you'll also have to fork out £70 for the pleasure. As odd and lethal as this menu sounds, the well-known French restaurant that boasts it as a hot new thing swears that the the dirt is made with harmless 'coffee grinds and palm fiber', as reported by Rocket News 24. Supplied by soil company Protoleaf, the dirt product was previously discarded as surplus, but now they sell it as a novel and eco-friendly compost - safe for human consumption. Bringing a whole new meaning to wash before use: Mmm, dirty salad . Dirt-smothered vegetables: The writer was impressed by the taste of the dishes . The chic restaurant in Tokyo’s Gotanda district, Ne Quittez Pas, is apparently famous for using high-quality seafood and produce from Kanagawa’s Misaki region. However, their new menu is created around the last ingredient any foodie would consider a luxury. The chef at Ne Quittez Pas recently won a TV cooking show battle with a sauce made with dirt ... but is the menu worth getting down and dirty for? Rocket News 24 shared their experience with MailOnline: 'The first course: a potato starch and dirt soup. It arrived in a shot glass looking so dark brown, it was almost black. It definitely looked like it had dirt in it. A slice of black truffle was balanced on top, and the staff instructed us to take a bite of it and then try the soup. So we did… and it was divine! There wasn’t a dirty flavor at all. Instead, this simple soup went down smoothly with just a hint of potato flavor,''The rim of the shot glass was dusted with salt like a margarita, so after the initial saltiness, your mouth filled with the mild flavor of the soup. The dish impressed us more with the chef’s skill than with the potential of the unusual ingredient, though,' they added. There's muddy risotto on my fork: Minerals of the sea and of the land indeed . The fish looks good, shame about the rice: It's fit for consumption and a novelty, so would you try it? The restaurant also serves a salad of grilled eggplant, tomato and turnips with dirt dressing and a fine powder made from ground popcorn. Also on the menu is a dish called 'minerals of the sea and minerals of the land' - clams, a layer of sediment, dirt risotto and sauteed sea bass and burdock root, and for dessert there's dirt ice cream with dirt gratin and 'cleansing' dirt mint tea. The writer was impressed overall: 'With its mild cuisine, sweet desserts and refreshing tea, the course had the flavor and modulation you would expect from Ne Quittez Pas’s talented chef.

An Iraqi immigrant who wrongly claimed £35,000 in benefits claims he did it in order to follow Islamic law. Majid Hussain received income support, housing benefit and a council tax reduction for 13 years - despite having a secret bank account worth £36,000. The unemployed 62-year-old signed forms saying he did not have any undeclared savings - and now says that under sharia law he did not consider the money to belong to him. He even read out extracts from the Koran in court today to bolster his argument. 'Cheat': Majid Hussain has been accused of misleading welfare officers over a £36,000 bank account . Hussain, from Exeter, has not worked since he arrived in Britain as a mature student in 1986, funded by Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government. He said he was left thousands of pounds by his father to pay for his children's education, and insisted he had a duty under Islamic law and his own culture not to spend the money himself. The father of four stopped receiving income support after the existence of the account was revealed in 2010 - at which point he immediately began withdrawing money from it, Exeter Crown Court heard. However, he is still receiving disability living allowance because he suffers from Crohn's Disease, kidney problems and muscle pain. Hussain has pleaded not guilty to two counts of dishonesty making false representation and one count of dishonesty obtaining money transfers. Claim: Hussain was given thousands in benefits despite having a secret savings haul given by his father . He has acknowledged that at the time he claimed the state funds he had an account with the Royal Bank of Scotland which grew from £18,000 to £36,000. The jury was given a dossier of forms signed by the defendant in which he declared that neither he nor any of his children - aged between nine and 18 - had any savings affecting the means test for their benefits. His defence statement read: 'He did not notify the DWP of some of the money under his control because it was left to him on strict Islamic terms by a relative for the sole use of his children. 'In accordance with Islamic belief and law, there was no possibility or option for it ever to be used for his own use and as such there was no intention to deceive.' Testifying in court on Wednesday, Hussain said: 'I read the Koran and in the Koran it commands you to honour your parents. 'You have to respect them. In the Koran we call them the ""Second God"".' Home: The defendant has lived in the UK since coming to Exeter as a student in 1986 . He continued: 'I have an article of the Koran here - it says, ""Allah commands you to render back your trust to those to whom they are due and not to break your oath. For Allah knows all that you do."" 'That's what we've been taught - always obey your parents. I was just going to keep the money for my children and not touch it. I had no right to the money.' He added that his father had 'worked so hard' to save the money he gave his son, working in heat of up to 56C (133F). Hussain initially told investigators he had saved the money from the scholarship he received from the Iraqi government while studying at the University of Exeter from 1986 to 1996, according to prosecutor Gareth Evans. When an official asked him if he knew his benefits would be withdrawn if he had declared the account, he said 'yes', the court heard. He then alleged started withdrawing large sums of money from the RBS account, reducing it by £24,000 over seven months. Mr Evans told jurors: 'I am afraid that his declarations that he had no bank accounts or savings with his wife or any children he was claiming for was a lie. 'If he would have disclosed this account then he would not have been entitled to benefits at all. 'He has been dishonest claiming his benefits, he knew that he should have declared the account and he failed to do so dishonestly in order to claim benefits.' The trial continues.

Privacy: Conservationists at London Zoo have been giving seahorses their own private 'honeymoon suite' in a bid to encourage breeding among the fish . Seahorses at London Zoo are given their own private 'honeymoon suite' in a bid to encourage breeding among the fish. Conservationists have managed to boost the numbers of the protected species at the zoo by giving courting seahorses a bit of privacy - separating them from the rest of the group when they look like they are about to mate. The zoo's work in boosting the numbers of native short and long-snouted varieties has for the last 17 years been taking place in a warehouse behind the public aquarium. But a special exhibition which opened yesterday has now made it available for all to see. Brian Zimmerman, curator of the aquariam at London Zoo, said: 'We noticed when we kept the seahorses in bigger groups, a pair would start a courtship dance, and another male - or sometimes a female - would try to muscle in and disrupt their ability to complete a courtship. 'Now we put a mixture of males and females in a larger courtship tank, then, when we observe a couple pairing off, we give them their own individual tanks. It's their honeymoon suite.' The work is being carried out as part of Project Seahorse, a worldwide breeding and conservation programme which aims to address what conservations believe to be the rapidly dwindling population of the fish. Seahorses, who mate for life, perform an elaborate flirtation dance when they choose a partner, giving very clear indications before they mate. It is when staff at the zoo see the fish carrying out such behaviour, which includes them entwining their tails, they remove them to a private breeding tank. London Zoo also uses spherical tanks with a current running through in a bid to keep more of the offspring alive. The tanks look to replicate ocean life for the young fry. When they are born they are removed straight away to allow their mother and father to start mating again. When they are a little older, the young fish themselves are moved into tanks where they can select mates.

Former model Marion Finlayson, 80, has been snapped up by a top Glasgow modelling agency  Colours, after catching the eye of scouts when she graced the catwalk after a 60-year break. The glamorous grandmother-of-two made her modelling debut back in the 1940s, and decided to tread the runway once again at a charity event in her hometown Aberdeen as a way of distracting herself from her husband Bruce's death. Back on the runway: Marion made her catwalk comeback at . Aberdeen City Council's 50 Plus Festival in August, a staggering 60 . years after her modelling debut . Marion, who is grandmother to Antonia, 13, and Andrew, 11, said: 'It's all go at the moment. I've never been busier since appearing on the catwalk last year. 'I actually got offers from two modelling agencies hundreds of miles away in Glasgow. 'It's great fun and I'm just happy to still do something I enjoy. I'm turning 81 next month so I think I'm doing alright.' Marion made her catwalk comeback at Aberdeen City Council's 50 Plus Festival in August, a staggering 60 years after her fashion debut. Back in the 1940s she gave up her modelling commitments to become a teacher, but decided to take part in the fashion show in Aberdeen as a distraction from the death of husband Bruce, to whom she was married for 54 years. Back in the day: Marion as a model in the 40s, before she gave up her career on the catwalk to become a teacher . Marion, who worked at the Albyn School in Aberdeen for years and went on to work with special needs children, said: 'My husband, Bruce, died a year and a . half ago after 54 years of marriage, a very good marriage, and I found . it very difficult to overcome it,' she explained. 'But doing this catwalk has really helped. I've got to meet lots of new, younger people, which I think is good for me. 'I even had a muscly personal trainer in tartan to walk me down the catwalk.' Marion says she likes to keep active, and regularly attends yoga and Pilates classes. Serious style credentials: After a 60 year break she made her return to the fashion world on the catwalk at a 50 Plus Festival in Aberdeen last year and was snapped up . 'I do yoga, Pilates and tums and bums . classes every week,' she says. 'My grandchildren are a handful as well, . they're always running about. 'The . modelling was something different and I would definitely do it again. If anyone asks me I will have a go - it's better than doing the ironing. 'I've been interested in fashion all my life and I'd be the first to admit that I'm a bit of a shopaholic.' Marion recently wowed millions of viewers as she appeared on ITV's This Morning show with Eamonn Holmes. Grief: The grandmother-of-two took part in the event to help deal with her grief over the death of her husband of 54 years, Bruce . Doing it for the older ladies: Despite the fact modelling is supposedly a young persons' game, Marion has found herself in demand . She said: 'I couldn't believe it.

The Duchess of Cambridge returned to the day job after a relaxing holiday on the island of Mustique today - and she looked the picture of health this morning as she attended an official engagement in London, her tiny bump highlighted with a flattering wrap dress. The Duchess, making her first appearance since returning from her break last week - and for the first time at an official engagement with a baby bump - chose a black and white MaxMara Studio dress from the 2011 collection, decided to forgo a coat, despite the chill in the air, and accessorised her look with just her £60 House Of Fraser court shoes and a light tan. The Duchess, who was reported to be dismayed after photos of her on the beach in a bikini were published in an Australian magazine earlier this month, looked cheerful and relaxed as she chatted to staff at Hope House, a residential centre in Clapham set up to help recovering addicts. At four and a half months pregnant, she is still remarkably slender apart from her tiny bump - clearly Kate hasn't been eating for two. Picture of health: The Duchess of Cambridge looked relaxed as she attended an engagement for one of her charities, Action On Addiction, at Hope House in London today, though at times she seemed protective of her bump, clasping her hands in front . Back on duty: Kate met clients and staff at Hope House, a 23-bed residential treatment centre in Clapham . Kate chose a graphic print wrap dress - very similar in style to an Issa or Diane von Furstenberg design - a savvy choice during pregnancy. 'A wrap dress is the perfect style to wear as a maternity dress,' a spokesperson from fashion news site fashionfreude.com told MailOnline. 'The silk jersey fabric is cool and comfortable and there are no tight waistbands around the middle, And with slim Kate's bump not likely to grow at the sort of rate that Kim Kardashian's is advancing, there's every likelihood she will be able to keep wearing this sort of dress right up until the end.' Spotlight: Kate hit the headlines today after Booker prize-winning author Hilary Mantel criticised her for being 'plastic' and 'painfully thin' - but today she looked slender, yes, but healthy and glowing . Blossoming: At four and a half months pregnant - almost halfway through - the Duchess's bump was just beginning to show . Stylish: Kate's simple wrap dress revealed a small bump - and also Kate's tanned legs following the Duchess's luxury break in Mustique with William and the Middletons . Warm-hearted: The Duchess of Cambridge made two youngsters . happy when she accepted their bouquet of flowers after she visited the . charity she supports . Demure: Kate made sure she didn't show too much cleavage by using a so-called modesty panel across the V-neck of the wrap dress . 'Despite . the frost on the ground, glowing Kate is doing the typical starlet . trick of turning up to an event without a coat which is surprising . considering she is pregnant and has just returned from a tropical break. Aside from the lack of winter wear . and the just-visible baby bump, she’s sticking to classic Kate style – . the belted waist, sheer tights and black courts from Episode at House of . Fraser (£60) are all looks we’ve seen several times before. A long-sleeved wrap dress is a . sensible wardrobe staple for many working women, just sling it on and . you’re camera ready in seconds. It's the perfect maternity style as it’s . not fitted and can be let out as your bump grows. Kate has accessorised hers with a ‘modesty panel’ to keep her cleavage under wraps. This being the Duchess, she’s showing . off perfect hair and make-up, but interestingly, she appears to have . already said ‘so-long’ to the fringe she recently had cut. Bearing in mind Kate has a hairstyling team at her beck and call, this is proof that bangs are seriously high maintenance!' Kate's glossy hair looked healthier than ever too - thanks no doubt to a good dose of the friendlier pregnancy hormones. The unruly fringe that flopped into her face for a few weeks at the end of last year was well on its way to growing out, and the rest looked bouncy and shiny. Kate spent the morning meeting clients and staff at Hope House, a 23-bed residential treatment centre in South West London that offers an Action on Addiction programme, providing a safe, comfortable place for women to recover from substance dependence and receive support for other compulsive disorders. Glossy: Kate's chestnut hair was blowdried into tumbling waves - and the heavy fringe she had cut in at the end of 2012 was close to growing out . Bejewelled: Tanned Kate accessorised her outfit with the diamond button pendant, £2,800 by Royal jewellers Asprey, and pearl earrings and her trademark glossy blow dry looked bouncier than ever . 'With its discreet purple centre and engraved . '167' address, the Asprey button is a stylish signature inspired by . buttons on old English garments,' Asprey say of the piece of jewellery . worn by Kate today - though whether it was a trick of the light, Kate's . centre stone looked to be more ruby-toned that the traditional purple .

David Cameron has renewed speculation about his tendency to ‘chillax’ on the job as he broke off his trade trip to India to play cricket. The Prime Minister began his visit with the biggest business delegation in history by revealing that he stays sane by having a good night’s sleep and employing good staff to do the work for him. He also claimed he would be watching Bollywood films on the flight out. Scroll down for video . Breaktime: The Prime Minister took some time out from talks to bat at Mumbai's Oval Maidan yesterday just hours after he confessed he has no time for the workaholic habits of his predecessors . Success: Mr Cameron scored several runs before being cleaned bowled in a game he appeared to enjoy . But he had been in Mumbai - the capital of Indian commerce - for just seven hours before he sloped off to Mumbai’s famous Oval Maidan, a vast square where several games are played at once. The cricket-loving Prime Minister wielded the bat against some ferocious deliveries from local youngsters who flock to the recreation ground in the centre of the city to play. After a few lusty blows, Mr Cameron’s middle stump was removed by a young bowler named Sachin - named after Mr Cameron’s own cricketing hero Sachin Tendulkar, the legendary cricketer who once gave Mr Cameron a signed bat. Mr Cameron’s technique won approving comments from members of the England women’s squad, who have been helping train boys and girls through the ECB-backed Global Cricket School while in town for the World Cup. Work and play: The PM told an audience at the headquarters of . Unilever in Mumbai that he would be 'hopeless' if he allowed himself to . become 'exhausted and fried mentally' by overwork . ‘He’s got used the rough surface very quickly,’ said former England captain Clare Connor, adding ‘that’s a brilliant cover drive’, just before Mr Cameron almost got himself out. School boss Sachin Bajaj said: ‘The PM was very chilled out, he was all smiles and very relaxed.‘He said he hadn’t had a hit for a long time but he got going and hit a few good cover drives.’ The Prime Minister’s cricketing sojourn came just hours after he confessed he has no time for the workaholic habits of his predecessors Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown. Lady Thatcher famously survived on four hours a night during her premiership. Yesterday: The Prime Minister also laid a wreath at the memorial to commemorate the policemen who were killed in the terrorist attacks of November 2008, in Mumbai . Mr Cameron called on India to further open up to foreign investment and said he wanted the two countries to have a 'special relationship' But . Mr Cameron told an audience at the headquarters of Unilever in Mumbai . that he would be 'hopeless' if he allowed himself to become 'exhausted . and fried mentally' by overwork. Asked . how he copes with the job, Mr Cameron said: ‘In terms of how I try to . keep body and soul together, I try to stay a little bit fit. ‘So I try to go for a run a week, I try to play a game of tennis every week and I try not to go to bed too late. ‘Like . all these things, that doesn’t always work, but the most important . thing is to have a very good team around you to make sure you can . delegate and have a team you can work with and get things done for you.’ David Cameron arrived in India with what he called Britain's biggest ever overseas business delegation for a three-day visit . Prime Minister David Cameron paid his respects to the policemen who were killed in the terrorist attacks of November 2008 . David Cameron announced the new visa service and relaxed immigration riles as he speaks n Mumbai, India . David Cameron launched an attack on 'aggressive' tax avoidance today. The Prime Minister said the Government wanted to keep business taxes low so long as businesses paid their fair share. But he said it would be 'difficult' for new laws to force companies to pay their taxes. Mr Cameron has made transparency over tax a key priority of Britain's presidency of the G8 group of world economic powers this year, after a series of controversies over the arrangements of huge companies which were shown to be paying little tax in the UK. He told an audience at the Unilever headquarters in Mumbai that the government are cutting the rate of corporation tax on company profits down to 21 per cent. He said: 'The message to business should be, ""If we are cutting this rate of tax down to a good low level, you should be paying that rate of tax, rather than seeking ever more aggressive ways to avoid it"".' 'I think the problem with that is that there are some forms of tax avoidance that have become so aggressive that there are moral questions that we have to answer about whether we want to encourage or allow that sort of behaviour.' 'Some would say, ""Just change the law to make aggressive avoidance illegal"", but, with respect to my friends in the accountancy profession, it is difficult to do that.' He added: ‘If you are exhausted and if you are fried mentally, you will be a hopeless prime minister. ‘You have to try to keep a good equilibrium and balance and then hopefully you can make good decisions.’ The . PM was embarrassed by a recent biography which quoted a friend saying: . ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for chillaxing, Dave would win it.’ Mr . Cameron also faced embarrassment at Unilever when he failed to name a . single one of the multinational company’s products - which include . Marmite, Persil and PG Tips - when asked which ones he buys. Attempting . to be diplomatic, the PM said: ‘We have very similar brands in the UK. I . don’t want to start a flurry of excitement by saying I use Pears soap . or whatever it is. 'I might get some of your brands wrong and mention a . dishwasher liquid we use and find out it’s made by your competitor. 'So, I’m going to do that thing politicians always do when they get a really tough one - and dodge the question.’ The . Prime Minister also unveiled plans to offer Indians a ‘same-day’ visa . service so that business people can travel to the UK more easily. The move comes in response to unhappiness with the current system – it can take three days or more to process applications. But . it will provoke claims that the tough line Mr Cameron strikes at home . on immigration is not matched when wooing foreigners to Britain. He . also said there was ‘no limit’ to the number of Indians who would be . allowed to study at UK universities and stay on in graduate-level jobs . after they qualified. Mr . Cameron said in Mumbai that his government had been forced to ‘turn . around an immigration system that was completely broken’ by shutting . down the ‘bogus colleges’ which thousands of migrants were using to . enter the country. But now, . he said, there would be ‘no limit on the number (of students) that can . come’ from India to study at Britain’s ‘world class’ universities. He . also called on the Indian government to be more open to British . investment and to sweep away barriers to trade which were holding back . development in India.","David Cameron said he would be 'hopeless' if he became 'exhausted' on job .

Google introduced a new privacy policy in March last year which allowed the company to track users across various services to target advertising. The changes sparked an outcry from American and European consumer advocacy groups. The California-based firm argued that the changes simplified and unified its policies across their various services such as Gmail, Android mobile systems, internet search, YouTube and social networking. Critics argued that the changes give Google, the world’s largest search engine, unprecedented power to track and monitor users. The policy also offers no opt out option other than refraining from using Google services.

Scotland Yard said the bill has reached £2.9million, with Metropolitan Police officers being stationed outside the embassy in Knightsbridge round-the-clock since June last year. The Ecuadorian government expressed concern at the 'significant' cost to taxpayers, but said it could be avoided if the Home Office guaranteed that the controversial figure will not be extradited to the United States.

Round the clock: The £2.9 million bill is for policing at the embassy from June last year to the end of January . The Met said the £2.9 million is an estimated total cost of policing the embassy between June and the end of January. Of the total bill, £2.3 million is opportunity costs - police officer pay that would be incurred in normal duties - and £0.6 million in overtime. Assange, 41, has been inside the embassy for nearly 250 days, with the cost per day of policing the building standing at nearly £13,000. A spokesman at the Ecuadorian embassy said: 'The Ecuadorian government is concerned by the significant cost to the taxpayers of London of policing the embassy at the present time. 'However, we believe this expenditure could be avoided if the UK Government would provide the undertakings that the Ecuadorian government has sort that there will be no onward extradition of Julian Assange to the United States.

An obituary for Max Shatto published Jan. 26 by the Midland . Reporter-Telegram says he was born on Jan. 9, 2010, in the town of . Pskov, near Russia's western border with Estonia. The boy lived with a . family in Gardendale, about 350 miles west of Dallas, before his death . on Jan. 21, according to the obituary. When reached by telephone, Mr Shatto told the Telegraph: 'We’re not aware of what any Russian envoy has said. We’re not making any comment.' Accusations: Pavel Astakho has alleged that Maxim was beaten to death by his American mother. American authorities have not confirmed the allegations are still investigating . On the funeral home's website, Max's parents wrote: 'Max, you were not with us long enough to leave fingerprints on the walls but you left fingerprints upon our hearts. 'When we get to Heaven, we know we will hear your sweet voice singing with the angels. We love you and will always miss you.' The death comes weeks after Russia announced it was banning all American . adoptions in retaliation for a new U.S. law targeting alleged Russian . human-rights violators. The ban also reflects lingering resentment over . the 60,000 Russian children adopted by Americans in the past two . decades, of which at least 19 have died. Russian Foreign Ministry official Konstantin Dolgov said in a statement that the boy's death was 'yet another case of inhuman treatment of a Russian child adopted by American parents.' Duesler said he could not immediately confirm or deny Russian allegations of abuse. Dolgov also accused the U.S. Department of State of not helping Russian consular officials investigate the death.

A State Department official said the government is aware of the case and 'takes very seriously the welfare of children, particularly children who have been adopted from other countries.' 'We will continue to assist the Russian Embassy and consulate officials in making contact with the appropriate authorities in Texas,' said the State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record about the matter.

A leading surgeon sacked after exposing poor care had written to the head of the NHS to warn patients were dying needlessly. Raj Mattu is the third whistleblower known to have raised his concerns with Sir David Nicholson. But no action was taken despite his hospital having the highest rate of avoidable deaths in the UK. Sir David is already under pressure to quit having presided over the Stafford hospital scandal in which up to 1,200 people are thought to have died through negligence. And he was head of the health authority responsible for Dr Mattu’s hospital when the renowned heart specialist warned him of ‘poor safety and excess death rates’. Raj Mattu is the third whistleblower known to have raised his concerns with Sir David Nicholson. But no action was taken despite his hospital having the highest rate of avoidable deaths in the UK . Dr Mattu also told him staff at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust were scared to speak out and those who did were victimised. The surgeon said Sir David, who is chief executive of the NHS, had ignored his warnings and should go. ‘After I raised serious concerns about patient safety and deaths I increasingly suffered victimisation, harassment and discrimination,’ he added. ‘I cannot foresee clinical staff being prepared to come forward or speak out on behalf of patients or the public when they see my obvious persecution. I know of clinicians at UHCW and the West Midlands NHS who have declined to come forward in fear of repercussion, and of avoidable deaths that continue at UHCW.’ The surgeon said Sir David Nicholson, who is chief executive of the NHS, had ignored his warnings and should go . Dr Mattu has fought a decade-long battle to clear his name which is believed to be the NHS’s longest-running and most expensive whistleblower dispute. He claims he was ousted after being suspended from his job in 2002 when he complained that overcrowded wards had caused the deaths of at least two patients. He claims a patient he was trying to resuscitate died when nurses could not reach him with lifesaving equipment because the bay was overcrowded. Dr Mattu also raised a Public Interest Disclosure request about the money-saving management policy of placing five beds in bays designed for four patients. He said that following his whistleblowing, he was suspended and paid £560,000 to do nothing for five years before being sacked in 2010. He is contesting his sacking. Last night, Dr Mattu said: ‘There’s a lot said about protecting whistleblowers, but the reality is there is no genuine desire by those in charge to protect them. A lot of senior managers do not seem to be able to distinguish between what is good for patients and what is good for the reputation of the NHS and for their jobs. ‘The culture comes right from the top. Sir David Nicholson’s position is untenable.’ A spokesman for NHS West Midlands denied that a copy of the letter from Dr Mattu’s letter of 2006 had been received by the then strategic health authority. He added: ‘All hospitals undertook a number of actions to make improvements including doing a clinical audit of cases and setting up a clinical group to regularly look at data.’ When Dr Mattu was suspended the Warwickshire trust had a zero-star rating because of its poor performance. Gary Walker, the former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, has also warned of a ‘culture of fear’ which deterred whistleblowers from coming forward. The trust’s ex-chairman has spoken out as well.","Raj Mattu is third whistleblower to raise concerns with Sir David Nicholson .

The internal document from Warwickshire Police says it aims to ‘protect people from harm’ with a range of ‘outcome focused’ functions that ‘are  professionally competent and understand the operational  policing context of their  services, ensuring that they are quality assured, effective and efficient’. Solving something: The 1,200 word document from Warwickshire Police does not mention the word crime once . The Enabling Services Directorate, a four-page management mission statement for HR, IT and communications, speaks of police chiefs vowing to be ‘accountable through performance measurement’. In 1,200 words, the word crime does not appear. The document is a contender for the Golden Bull award, run by the Plain English Campaign. Spokesman Chrissie Maher said: ‘It’s absolute rubbish as far as I am concerned. It’s a screen to hide behind. It just makes me think ""what are they up to?""’ ‘How can I make informed decisions if they do not talk to me in plain English? Gobbledegook gives me no choice.

The list advises officers not to refer to the colour black in case it offends someone. The report states: ‘Don’t use phrases that include Black in a negative context, such as ‘Black mark’ ‘Black day’.

Adam Lanza set out on his shooting spree in Newtown, Connecticut, intent on killing people people than Norwegian mass-murderer Ander Breivik, it was claimed today. A new report says Lanza, 20, targeted Sandy Hook Elementary School because he believed it was the best place for him to shoot as many people as possible and rival the 77 lives claimed by Breivik in 2011. The details could shed more light on what caused Lanza to kill his mother and then commit a shooting rampage that left 20 first graders and six adults dead on December 14. Copycat? A new report suggests that Adam Lanza, who killed 27 people, meant to top the number of murders committed by Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Breivik in 2011 . Young victims: Lanza targeted two first grade classrooms at Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 people . Similar ends: Breivik also targeted young people. He killed 69 at a youth summer camp organized by the Labor Party. A total of 77 died in his two attacks . CBS News quotes two anonymous officials with inside knowledge of the police investigation as saying Sandy Hook offered the 'easiest target' and the 'largest cluster of people' for him to attack. The Connecticut State Police dismissed the CBS report as 'pure speculation' and said the assertions about Breivik are not true. Lanza left no note explaining his motives and smashed his hard drive before for the shooting, leaving few clues about why he killed his mother Nancy Lanza in her bed and then shot his way through the school. Police believe Lanza may have been playing out a scenario in one of his favorite video games and was obsessed with achieving a higher 'score' than Breivik by killing even more people, according to CBS. Both Lanza and Breivik men apparently shared a love of the Call of Duty - the realistic combat shooting game and used it as 'training' for the deadly massacres. Detectives found thousands of dollars worth of video games in a den with darkened windows where Lanza spent hours playing. Both killers also used American-made .223-caliber assault rifles. Breivik armed himself with a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. Lanza used a Bushmaster AR-15. Devastation: The murders of 20 first graders and six teachers shocked the nation and horrified the quiet community of Newtown . Mother: Nancy Lanza had taken her son to a shooting range for years, and was shot dead by her son with one of her own guns . Breivik, 32 at the time, shocked the world in July 2011 . when he planted a car bomb in downtown Oslo, Norway, and then attacked a . summer camp run by the country's Labor Party. Eight people died in the bomb blast and 204 were injured. Breivik shot dead 67 people and wounded 33 more. He was later taken alive by police and said he carried out the attacks to combat socialism and the immigration of Muslims to Norway. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, though his prison term can be extended every five years. Unlike Breivik, Lanza would not be taken alive. He reportedly fired several rounds at police cars as they arrived on the scene. He then shot himself in the head and was found dead by police who swept through the building. House of horrors: It is thought that Nancy was planning a move from their house in Newtown, pictured, for Washington state to find a place for Adam to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20-year-old . Along with the video games, Adam . Lanza also learned how to fire guns during numerous sessions with his . mother Nancy Lanza at a shooting range, where the two 'bonded, the Hartford Courant . reported on Sunday. Her landscaper Dan Holmes told the paper: 'She said she took her kids target shooting, that they bonded over that.' Nancy Lanza was seen as a dedicated . mother to Adam, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome and a . sensory integration disorder - an aversion to bright lights and loud . noises. She had enrolled and pulled Adam into . numerous schools over the years after growing unsatisfied with the . education he was receiving. Victims: Top row- (L-R) Ana Marquez-Greene, Caroline Previdi, Jessica Rekos, Emilie Parker, Noah Pozner. Second row: (L-R) Jesse Lewis, Olivia Engel, Josephine Gay, Charlotte Bacon, Chase Kowalski.

Fifth row: (L-R) Lauren Rousseau, Mary Sherlach, Victoria Soto, Dawn Hochsprung, Nancy Lanza . More victims: Madeline Hsu, six, left, and Allison Wyatt, also six, right, were shot dead on December 14 at their school . She was planning a move to Washington state with the hopes of getting her son back into a college program. But Adam Lanza also received an education on weapons from his mother, who took him target shooting at a gun range for years. Richard . Novia, a security chief in the Newtown School system who moderated the . tech club - of which Adam had been a member - said he disagreed with . Nancy Lanza's recreation with her son. He told the Courant: 'It's a serious mistake, first of all.

The RSPCA has been accused of wasting £13,500 of taxpayers' cash and donations after it pursued a family through the courts only for a hunt case to collapse straight away. Farmer Keith Watson used a terrier to legally flush out a fox last year, before he and his family were then accused of disturbing a badger sett by the charity. A police raid on their farm followed, with equipment seized, while Mr Watson, his partner Tanya Norlander, and his teenage daughter Hannah Watson were separated and taken for hour-long interviews at a local police station. Victory: Keith Watson, his daughter Hannah, and partner Tanya at their farm on the day the RSPCA case against them was thrown out . For a year the family has lived under 'extreme stress' and Hannah now 19, was left 'unable to sleep' or study for her A-levels. 'I just gave up. It was too stressful,' she said. But yesterday the case against them collapsed on the first morning at Crewe Magistrates' Court after the RSPCA admitted they did not have enough evidence against them to continue. It is estimated the charity spent £3,500 of donations funding the botched case and the taxpayer will have to pick up the estimated legal bill of £10,000 for the family's defence lawyers. Upset: The family were split up and interviewed by police after a fox was legally flushed out on the farm, which led to the RSPCA claiming they disturbed a badger sett . Mr Watson claims animal activists had 'hidden behind bushes' to secretly film the activity at a fox's earth - the evidence the later used to try and prosecute him. He maintains the area was not being used by badgers and that his family was targeted for doing nothing wrong in an effort to stop the hunt. 'It is a nightmare when you know you are not guilty and you have done nothing wrong but you are being picked on to make an example of,' he said. 'The RSPCA are not interested in animal welfare, they are just going after the hunting community. They do not have to pay the bills, it is the taxpayer.' Case: The hearing at Cheshire Magistrates Courts yesterday collapsed when the RSPCA admitted they did not have enough evidence . Hannah, who was eighteen at the time of the raid on her family's Cheshire farm in March last year called the behaviour 'intimidating.' She said: 'I feel my family was targeted. It was intimidating and very scary.' Their solicitor Stephen Welford called the move to prosecute the family, who regularly help with the Cheshire Hunt to hunt legally with dogs, 'an ill-informed decision.' Tim Bonner, Director of Campaigns at the Countryside Alliance, accused the animal charity of pursuing a 'vindictive campaign' against legal hunts based on 'weak and flawed' evidence. 'It is simply disgraceful that the RSPCA is using the criminal justice system to pursue a vindictive campaign against the hunting community,' he said. 'There is no way on earth that the police and Crown Prosecution Service would have prosecuted on such flawed and weak evidence, but the RSPCA pursued Mr Watson and his family simply because they were part of the Cheshire Hunt.' View: The family's solicitor said they were only targeted because they were part of the famous Cheshire Hunt (pictured) He added the RSPCA also have two other ongoing cases connected to hunts in the North West and Wiltshire, one of which also involves interfering with a badger sett. The news comes as the Charities Commission questioned the RSPCA's use of its own funds to bring prosecutions after a judge criticised the charity for spending £326,000 prosecuting David Cameron's local hunt the Heythrop. The charity pointed out that the case against Mr Watson was reviewed against the Code for Crown Prosecutors and at all stages leading up to the trial, it had been considered appropriate to prosecute. 'The RSPCA believes that if it is presented with evidence of alleged offences concerning animal cruelty they should be properly investigated and prosecuted where appropriate,' a spokesman said. 'It is extremely rare that RSPCA cases conclude like this. We prosecute roughly 1 per cent of the incidents we are asked to investigate and have a success rate of around 98 per cent.'","Charity took family to court after they helped flush out a fox from their farm .

Sharon Shoesmith, the council boss at the centre of the Baby P scandal, was in court yesterday to support two social workers who say they were unjustly fired after the child’s death. Maria Ward and Gillie Christou say they were ‘hung out to dry’ by London’s Haringey Council after the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly. Mrs Shoesmith, the council’s then director of children’s services, won her unfair dismissal claim and is due £1million. Peter was found dead in his bloodied cot in August 2007 after horrific abuse despite being on a council ‘at-risk’ list with 60 visits from social workers, police and health staff in eight months. Hearing: (L-R) Gillie Christou, Sharon Shoesmith and Maria Ward were three of Baby P's social workers, and say they were unjustly fired . Tragic: Baby P was a 17-month old boy who died in London after suffering more than 50 injuries over an eight-month period . His death shocked Britain and led to . huge reforms in children’s services. Peter’s mother Tracey Connelly, 31, . her sadistic boyfriend Steven Barker, 36, and his brother Jason Owen, . 40, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child’s death. Support: Former children's services boss at Haringey, Sharon Shoesmith, was in the public gallery watching the proceedings . Mrs Shoesmith, 59, has said she . considered suicide, lives in fear of revenge attacks and is . ‘unemployable’ after losing her £130,000-a-year job. She sat in the public gallery at the . Court of Appeal. Miss Ward was Peter’s social worker from February 2007 . until his death. Mrs Christou was her team leader and supervisor. Karon Monaghan QC, representing both . women, said Miss Ward had to move home after the scandal. She said: . ‘Miss Ward was advised to disguise herself with members of the public . calling her a murderer.’ Lord Justice Laws, Lord Justice Elias . and Lord Justice McCombe heard both were ‘junior’ staff and were . disciplined after the death as there was a period of 12 days when they . did not know Peter’s whereabouts. But ‘media and political pressure’ led to a second disciplinary hearing after which the pair were fired for the same reason. Miss Monaghan said: ‘The fact it might be politically expedient to hang a person out to dry doesn’t mean it’s acceptable.’ The pair’s legal team claim they suffered ‘double jeopardy’ as they faced two misconduct panels for the same allegations. Bruce Carr QC, for Haringey Council, . said of the case: ‘A child subject to child protection plan is failed by . his social workers up to the point he died.’ A ruling will be given at a date yet to be fixed. Mrs Shoesmith sat in the public . gallery, directly behind her former staff, as the Court of . Appeal was told they were sacked because of political and media pressure . called for 'heads to roll'. Jailed: . Baby P's mother Tracey Connelly (left), her lover Steven Barker . (centre) and his brother Jason Owen (right) were jailed in May 2009 for causing or . allowing the little boy's death . Bruce Carr QC representing Haringey . Council opposed the claim and said it was a case where: ‘A child subject . to child protection plan is failed by his social workers up to the . point he died.’ He claimed the social workers had ‘ceded control of the child for 12 days and nobody knew where it was.’ A Watford employment tribunal . concluded in 2010 that the local authority acted reasonably in . dismissing the pair because of serious failings in their care of the . toddler. The women then challenged that ruling . at the Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) in central London, but their . appeals were dismissed in May last year. The EAT ruled that the employment . tribunal did not ‘err in law or come to perverse conclusions’ in . rejecting their claims for unfair dismissal. The court later reserved its decision. Lord Justice Laws described it as an ‘important and in some ways anxious case’.","Maria Ward was Peter Connelly's social worker and Gillie Christou her boss .

A former drug dealer and prisoner who said he was so evil he was 'like the antichrist' has ditched his life of crime to become a church pastor. Darrell Tunningley began his criminal career at the age of 11 by stealing badges off expensive cars. By the age of 16 he was selling heroin and cocaine and funding a £300-a-day heroin habit before being jailed for five-and-a-half years for being the driver in an armed robbery. Now Mr Tunningley, 35, who is married . with two children, has been appointed senior pastor alongside his . father-in-law at Hope Corner Community Church in Runcorn, Cheshire, . where he preaches and discusses his former life. He found God in a hopeless place: Darrell Tunningley ditched a life of crime to turn to religion . Mr Tunningley, pictured in HMP Brough in 1999, was serving five-and-a-half years behind bars when he met two nuns who changed his life . Now Mr Tunningley is married to social worker Rebekah, the daughter of a church minister. They have two children, Benjamin, four, and Lydia-Grace, 18 months . The pastor, who grew up on the Warwick estate in Knottingley, Leeds, said: 'I wasn't far off being an antichrist - I . just didn't care at all. 'I genuinely felt dead on the inside and didn't . feel anything apart from hate and anger and guilt. 'Where I was knocking about and the . people I was hanging round crime was everywhere and everybody was doing . it, so it was only a matter of time before I got involved.' He said: 'I got into drugs like cannabis, LSD and . solvents and when the drugs trend moved on to the rave scene and . ecstasy came about I got into that. 'We were going out to all the illegal . raves taking drugs, selling drugs so I could cover whatever I was . taking. 'Then my drug habit escalated and with that the come downs were . so bad I would smoke heroin to help me feel more normal.' 'At worst when I was around 16 I was . using an 8th of heroin a day which is around £250 to £300 so started debt collecting for dealers to fund my habit.' A . friend recruited him to steal a car and be the driver for an armed . robbery at a wages depot but after the raid, one of their accomplices . turned them in to police when he was held on a serious assault charge. Mr Tunningley is now senior pastor at Hope Corner Community Church in Runcorn, Cheshire - quite a change from the confines of HMP Brough . Darrell Tunningley, pictured front, now gives talks about his experiences and works with young people as part of his ministry . Mr Tunningley was sent to HMP Wolds in Brough, East Yorkshire, where he set out to be 'the best kind of bad' he could possibly be. He said: 'Even in prison I would go looking for . opportunities to cement my reputation. 'I would do violent things for no . reason - I put a lad in hospital after setting about him with a snooker . ball in a sock because I thought he looked at me in the wring way and I . even assaulted a prison officer who I thought was being disrespectful.' He continued to sell drugs and spent time in segregation for the assaults. But an encounter in the welding workshop, where another prisoner was signing people up to a meeting in the prison chapel - which meant an afternoon out of his cell as well as free coffee and biscuits. Mr Tunningley said: 'There were two nuns and I gave them a . load of abuse but they were very patient and seemed to listen to what I . had to say.' He said the nuns responded with compassion and were 'love bombs'. 'I thought I would never have the capacity to feel any kind . of love again - but the way they treated me stopped me in my tracks.' That night he said a prayer and vowed to devote his life to God if He would take away his demons. Darrell and Rebekah Tunningley on their wedding day in 2005 - only five years after his release from prison after serving a sentence for armed robbery . The next morning, he threw away his tobacco and cannabis after trying to smoke it made him feel sick, and began walking away from fights. He was visited in prison by Mark Finch - who would eventually become his father-in-law. Mr Tunningley said: 'He spoke to me and said that the church would be a really good place for me to go after I was released. 'I knew that it was the right place to go so I went back to his house and met his two children and his wife.' Mr Tunningley joined the Hope Corner Community Church in August 2000 and after a few years of friendship with Mr Finch's social worker daughter Rebekah, 26, they began dating. The couple married seven years ago and have two children, Benjamin, four, and Lydia-Grace, 18 months. 'I've never been so happy in my life,' he . said. 'I love doing what I do and I hope those listen to what I have to . say and like it too. Hope Corner Community Church in Runcorn, Cheshire is now the centre of Darrell's life . 'Previously what I did could have ruined lives yet . what I hope I do now will very much enrich them.' Mr Tunningley is now a senior paster at the church, alongside his father-in-law. He also helped found Hope Corner Academy last summer - a church-run special educational needs school. Mr Finch said: ""Darrell is not the same person that went into prison for sure. 'He's matured greatly since he's been with us, and to be honest if you met him you would never guess the kind of life that he was involved with. It's a radical change. 'He's enhanced all our community work - especially the drug awareness course. 'It's one thing getting information about a subject but it's another thing when it comes from someone who has experienced it. 'Young people get to understand what drugs can do because there's someone standing there telling you what happened to them.'

A heroin addict and her partner whose two-year-old son died after drinking his mother's methadone at home wept uncontrollably in the dock today as they were jailed for his manslaughter. Sally Dent, 33, and Shaun Binfield, 45, were found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court last month over the death of Riley Pettipierre, who died after drinking the heroin substitute last March. The pair cried today as Dent was sentenced to seven and a half years for her son's manslaughter and her partner Binfield, who is also Riley's father, was jailed for four years on the same charge. Tragic: Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March after drinking methadone from a child's beaker that was left on a set of drawers in his parents' home, Nottingham Crown Court heard . The pair had denied the charges, but . Dent was also found guilty of a separate charge of cruelty to a child . under the age of 16 for failing to keep methadone out of the reach of . her child. Sentencing the couple from Belper, Derbyshire, at court . this morning, Judge John Milmo QC said: ‘You will both have his death on . your consciences for the rest of your lives.’ The child's green and yellow beaker . had been placed on a chest of drawers in the couple's bedroom at the . flat so that Dent could easily drink the methadone if she needed it . during the night. The next day Dent awoke to find . Riley's lifeless body next to her in the bed after he had drunk the . heroin substitute from the cup. Dent, who had been addicted to heroin . since she was 16 and cocaine, called 999 but the toddler's heart had . stopped beating and his lips were blue when the paramedics arrived. He . was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival at hospital. Post-mortem tests showed that Riley had enough methadone in his blood, stomach and urine to prove fatal. He is believed to have consumed . between 10ml and 20ml of the heroin substitute, the court heard. Traces . of cocaine were also found in his hair. Emotional: This is a drawing from inside Nottingham Crown Court of Sally Dent and Shaun Binfield . Parents: Shaun Binfield (left) and Sally Dent (right) were pictured outside Nottingham Crown Court . The trial had heard that Dent had been . prescribed methadone to help her get rid of her heroin addiction but . had struggled to kick the drug. Today the judge accepted Binfield's . culpability in Riley's manslaughter was less than his partner's but . condemned the couple for failing to move the cup out of the toddler's . reach. 'You will both have his death on your consciences for the rest of your lives' Judge John Milmo QC . Mr Milmo said: ‘You both knew the . beaker was in a place to which he had access. Ms Dent showed a reckless . disregard for the child's safety by asking Shaun Binfield to move it. ‘But you Mr Binfield didn't bother to . check the next morning whether there was methadone still in the cup at . the side of the bed. ‘You had the last opportunity to . protect your son and you failed in that duty. There was no excuse for . leaving it where Riley could get to it.’ The judge said he had taken into . consideration that the family had ensured the physical safety of their . child by installing safety gates around their home and that witnesses . during the trial had spoke of a well-cared for and clean home. But Mr Milmo added: ‘If one parent is addicted to Class A drugs, there must be a risk to a child.’ Sadness: Mourners leave flowers outside a disused shop below the flat where Riley Pettipierre died last March . Trial: Dent and Binfield were found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) last month . In mitigation, Dent's barrister Simon . Clarke said the family had tried to minimise Riley's exposure to the . drug by installing child-proof gates around their home and ensuring . Binfield looked after the children in a different room while Dent took . her drugs in the kitchen. He said Dent would be ‘punished for the rest of her life’ for failing to move the cup. Defending Binfield, Paul Mann asked the judge to bear in mind the 45-year-old's personal loss when sentencing him. 'You had the last opportunity to protect your son and you failed in that duty. There was no excuse for leaving it where Riley could get to it' Judge John Milmo QC . He said that Binfield had tried to persuade Dent to get off the drugs during their relationship. ‘Riley was a daddy's boy. They had a close bond. Mr Binfield has lost his son and his liberty,’ Mr Mann told the judge. I ask that you impose punishment measured with a degree of mercy.’ Family and friends sobbed in the . public gallery as the judge jailed Dent for seven and a half years for . manslaughter. She was handed a three-year sentence to run concurrently . for the second charge of cruelty to a child. Binfield was jailed for four years for manslaughter as the judge said he was satisfied his culpability was less than Dent's. The pair were told they would serve half their sentences before been released on licence.","Riley Pettipierre, two, of Belper, Derbyshire, died in hospital last March .

Jailed again: Convicted rapist Hilland Matthews went on to sexually assault another woman after being released from prison and moving across Britain . A convicted rapist went on to sexually assault another victim after blundering police failed to keep track of him when he moved home across Britain. Window cleaner Hilland Matthews, 66, carried out an 'horrific sex attack' in Ipswich after moving 250 miles from the scene of his previous rape in South Wales. An MP today called for an investigation to discover why police failed to pass on Matthews' history of sexual offending after the rapist was jailed again for a sex crime. Caerphilly MP Wayne David has demanded an investigation into what happened - and is tabling a question to the Home Office. The Labour MP said: 'This cannot be an issue that continually falls to the bottom of somebody's in-tray.' Ipswich Crown Court heard last Thursday how Matthews was convicted of rape in 1992 and was freed after serving four years in prison. It was just months before the sex offenders' register was brought in - but police still had a duty to keep tabs on Matthews. The court heard Matthews moved from his home in South Wales to Ipswich three years ago. But police in Suffolk were not told by the Welsh officers that the convicted rapist was now living on their patch. Matthews broke into the home of a 53-year-old woman where he put her through an 'horrific ordeal'. Ipswich Crown Court heard the woman deliberately scratched Matthews' face - knowing she would have his DNA under her nails. Convicted: Matthews was jailed at Cardiff Crown Court, pictured, in 1992 for raping a 89-year-old woman. He was released four years later - a year before the introduction of the sex offenders register . Detectives put the sample through the police national computer and came up with a near match for one of Matthews' relatives. Matthews' profile was not on file because his last known crime was before suspects had to give a DNA sample. But the court heard police tracked Matthews down through the DNA of a relative - and then realised he had raped before. Matthews, of Ipswich, was jailed for nine years after admitting two charges of sexual assault and trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence. Judge David Goodin told him: 'You targeted a woman who lived alone - the horror she must have felt is unimaginable. 'She thought at one stage her last minute had come and that she was going to die. Matthews was jailed last week at Ipswich Crown Court, pictured, for nine years for sexual assault of a 53-year-old woman. The court heard police had a duty to keep tabs on him after his last conviction but did not alert other forces when he moved . 'As you mauled her she had the courage to fight back and her presence of mind in scratching your face and arms led to your arrest.' Matthews was aged 46 and living in Caerphilly, South Wales, with his 63-year-old girlfriend when he carried out his first rape. He broke into the home of an 89-year-old woman and attacked her in her bed where she had been sleeping. He was jailed at Cardiff Crown Court for four years for the attack in 1992. Ipswich Crown Court heard how Matthews had previously been jailed for 18 months for indecent assault in 1974 and jailed for four years in 1980 for attempted rape. Matthews had not been on the Sex Offenders’ Register, as his earlier convictions pre-dated the register, which does not include anyone who was convicted before 1997. Matthews details were kept by Gwent Police in South Wales but were not passed on to officers in Ipswich when he lived there three years ago. Matthews was ordered to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life when he is eventually freed. Matthews was living in Caerphilly, South Wales, when he raped an 89-year-old woman. After being released from prison, he moved to Ipswich, but Police in Suffolk weren't notified that a convicted sexual offender had moved into their area .","Window cleaner Hilland Matthews was jailed in 1992 for rape in Caerphilly .

Banned: David Bradley, 55, cannot teach for at least two years after he . admitted streaking across a field with a group of year 8 pupils (file picture) A grammar school teacher who streaked naked in front of his pupils has been banned from Britain's classrooms for at least two years. Education Secretary Michael Gove imposed the sanction on David Bradley, 59, after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' while working at North Cestrian Grammar School, in Altrincham, Cheshire. Bradley, who received an MBE four years . ago for his work with children on the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, quit his job last month after admitting it had been . ‘inappropriate’ to streak. He had been camping with the group of 12-and 13-year-olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden. The married teacher told a disciplinary panel: ‘The lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying, “Come on sir, you have a go.” ‘At that point, for whatever reason, I got up, ran down the garden and ran back in. Even when I did it I thought, “What am I doing?”’ The Teaching Agency, who announced the ban today said: 'We are satisfied on the evidence that he took the conscious decision to agree to streak, then moved out of his sleeping bag, removed his boxer shorts and then ran with pupils in the garden. Bradley said that he could not explain why he had behaved in that way, but claimed that in November 2011 he was close to a breakdown due to stress and the pressure of work. Their report went on: 'Mr Bradley confirmed that there were no complaints raised by any children, and the children had found it hilarious.' Recommending he should be struck off the disciplinary panel said: 'Teachers are expected to behave in a manner which ensures the maintenance of appropriate professional boundaries. 'We believe that your actions in engaging in the streak failed to maintain the clear boundaries and appropriate delineation of behaviour which should exist between pupils and teachers. Your behaviour failed to ensure the maintenance of appropriate boundaries which are essential in order to ensure that a teacher's position of trust, responsibility and authority are upheld.' Bradley had undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the Solwaybank centre in Dumfries and Galloway in November 2011. The veteran teacher, from Hale Barns in Greater Manchester, was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham, Cheshire, where he taught. However, the Teaching Agency hearing in Coventry ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl, who Bradley said was hypothermic, did not amount to misconduct. Respected: Four years ago Mr Bradley was handed an MBE but has now left North Cestrian Grammar School in Altrincham in disgrace after the school trip . The English master was awarded an MBE in 2008 for services . to young people after running schemes for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award . for 30 years. He said at the time that organising . trips was ‘normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal . vitality the young exude’. Bradley, who has taught for 37 years, said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional. However, referring to the accusations . about hugging the girl,  Bradley said he was ‘aghast’ that what used to . be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints. ‘The thing that comes out of this is how out of date I am,’ he said. ‘What is viewed as normal today seems . to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult can’t be near to . a child without being accused of something. I’m aghast.’","David Bradley, 55, admits he acted 'inappropriately' by stripping .

A widow who lost her husband to cancer three years ago is now fighting a battle with Hallmark to create end-of-life sympathy cards. Activist and artist Regina Holliday has been petitioning for the immensely popular card company to create a line of hospice cards that are meant to say goodbye to friends, loved ones, and acquaintances. Though the greeting card company has plenty of ‘Get Well Soon’ cards and sympathy cards if the worst should happen, there are no cards specifically designed for someone in terminal care. Last respects: Artist and activist Regina Holliday, pictured, is trying to get Hallmark to create a series of cards meant for hospice patients . Available options now: Two current options from Hallmark's 'Get Well Soon' section, neither of which Mrs Holliday believes appropriate for a person who is terminally ill . Speaking to MailOnline from her home in Washington, Mrs Holliday said that she hopes to change the way the card giant looks at end of life, saying that the flow of cards to her husband Fred stopped as soon as he was moved into hospice care for his terminal liver cancer. Fear of the unknown: Mrs Holliday says thatnot knowing what to say or how to say it stops many people from sending cards to people in hospice care . ‘When my husband Fred and I were in rehab, we had all these great cards saying fight the good fight, you can do it, cheering you on, thinking you could actually have an effect on cancer.’ But when Mr Holliday’s cancer worsened and he was moved to hospice, the flow of well-wishes and cards stopped abruptly. ‘People didn’t know what to say,’ the mother of two explained. ‘Some people would send “Thinking of You” and a few sent “Our Deepest Sympathy” cards. My husband actually chortled and said, “I’m not dead yet!”’ Mr Holliday passed away from cancer on June 17, 2009. Mrs Holliday, who worked several years at a retail store that sold greeting cards, said she started working on the idea when her husband was still alive. Adding a row of cards clearly labled as ‘end of life,’ she said, will show people there’s an option for that difficult time in life, and start a dialogue on how to say goodbye to loved ones. ‘People are scared to say goodbye. And because they’re so scared, they don’t do it,’ she said. Mrs Holliday wrote on her blog that Hallmark did not recognize the word ‘hospice’ or ‘end of life’ in its search engine, instead pointing out a card for a Bat Mitzvah. According to ABC News, Mrs Holliday tried for a year to get in touch with company representatives to address End of Life cards. Loss: Fred Holliday was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer and passed away in 2009 in hospice care . Options: In response to Mrs Holliday's request, Hallmark offered a series of cards like these; the widow points out that the card on the right still doesn't have the right message . In her latest effort, she created the Change.org petition, which has more than 3,200 supporters. Finally, Hallmark introduced nine greeting cards specifically for people in hospice care. One card features a curly script with the words ‘Caring thoughts are with you’ on the cover. Inside, the card reads: ‘Nothing can ease the difficulty of what is happening in your life, but every day – you are wished a little peace of mind.’ Another more twee card shows an illustrated sheep with the accompanying text: ‘I’m not sure what to do, I’m not sure what to say… But one things’ for sure – I promise to pray!’ 'I began advocacy before Fred died. He . saw this beginning and he's incredibly proud. He got to see that and I . know he’d be so happy.' Another one reads: ‘Cancer is tough, but you are tougher!’ Mrs Holliday told MailOnline that while this is a step in the right direction, the message is still off, especially to patients who are not religious or who simply will not win the battle against the disease. ‘If you’re going to talk about win and lose, cancer just won,’ she said, adding that people may mean well with their words of encouragement, they may not be the words a very ill person wants to hear. Family: Mr Holliday pictured in hospital with their two sons, now seven and 14; she says he would be proud of the work she's doing . Hallmark spokesperson Linda Odell told MailOnline that while it is true the company doesn't carry cards 'that specifically say ""hospice,"" we do have quite a few that address the need Mrs Holliday has quite accurately expressed tp provide support and care for people at the end of life.' She added that many of Hallmark's cards can be personalized 'if the suggested message is not quite what the individual is looking for.' The company also wrote in a recent news release that they have ‘nearly 100 cards to help people share words of support for a range of life situations, including cancer treatment, terminal illness, grief support, recovery/rehab, and other difficult times, as well as cards for caregivers.’ The new line of hospice care cards will be appearing in Hallmark Gold Crown stores throughout the year. ‘I began advocacy before Fred died. He saw this beginning and he’s incredibly proud. He got to see that and I know he’d be so happy. ‘Before we hit hospice, it was the worst part of our lives, and I’m so glad that I can do this for him,’ she said.","Artist and activist Regina Holliday lost husband Fred to cancer in 2009 .

Tragic: Freya James, 8, was taken ill after the incident at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, Middlesex, last Thursday and died in hospital . An eight-year-old girl has died after apparently falling over in the playground at school. Freya James was taken ill at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, Middlesex, last Thursday and later died in a London hospital. Her death is being treated as non-suspicious. Her parents released an emotional statement, saying Freya was 'loved by everybody who had contact with her' and their 'hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly' following her death. They said: 'Freya was an Angel and was loved by everybody who had contact with her. 'She was a bundle of energy from the time she woke up to the time she went to bed. She was so strong and determined in everything she did and always tried to help those that struggled. 'Our princess has gone but we know her spirit and her memories will always be with us. Our lives have been absolutely shattered. Our hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly and we are left with scars that will never heal.' The school is linked with five others in . the area, and a governor at a neighbouring school said health and . safety procedures were looked into at all those linked to Trafalgar . following the death. The governor said: ‘As far as we can tell at the moment it looks like everything has been done by the book.

Microsoft today launched an all out attack on Google in the email world with its new Outlook.com service. The computer giant is to force users of its existing Hotmail and MSN email services to use the system, which officially launched today, in a bid to boost its uptake. The firm has also unveiled a $90million ad campaign - but immediately came under fire for the attack on arch rival Google in the 'Scroogled' ad, which depicted the search giant's Gmail service as a 'snooping' service. Scroll down for video . Microsoft's new outlook.com email service, which officially launches today. The firm hopes it will help it compete with Google and Yahoo in the email market . Google . says Gmail has more than 425 million account holders, including those . that only visit on smartphones and other mobile device. The . latest data from research firm comScore, which doesn't include mobile . traffic, shows Gmail with 306 million worldwide users through December, . up 21 per cent from the previous year. Yahoo's . email ranked second with 293 million users, a 2 percent decrease from . the previous year, followed by Hotmail at 267 million users, a 16 . per cent decline from the previous year. During . the preview period, Outlook attracted 60 million account holders, . including about 20 million that defected from Gmail, according to . Microsoft. Microsoft says its new online service lets users easily send pictures to friends, and integrates Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is so confident it has the Internet's best email service that it is about to spend at least $30 million to send its message across the U.S. All users of Microsoft's Hotmail and other email services operating under different domains such as MSN.com will be automatically converted to Outlook.com by the summer, if they don't voluntarily switch before then. All the old messages, contacts and settings in the old inboxes will be exported to Outlook.com. Users will also be able to keep their old addresses. 'Last summer, we released a preview of Outlook.com, a new modern email service from Microsoft,' David Law of Microsoft said. 'Since then, we've been humbled by the fast pace of adoption with over 60 million people already actively using Outlook.com. 'Today, we're excited to announce the next step in this journey: Outlook.com is coming out of preview and people everywhere can get started and give it a try at Outlook.com. 'Today is a major milestone in our mission to provide people everywhere with the world's best email experience.' Experts say Email remains a key battleground, even at a time when more people are increasing turning to texts and instant messaging services. The recurring email habit provides Internet companies a way to keep people coming back to websites, and gives people a reason to log in during their visits so it's easier for email providers to track their activities. Frequent visits and personal identification are two of the keys to selling ads, the main way most websites make money. Microsoft is set to force all users of its MSN and Hotmail service to use outlook.com - whether they want to move or not . After keeping Outlook.com in a 'preview' phase since July 31, Microsoft today officially launched it. To welcome new users, Microsoft is financing what it believes to be the biggest marketing blitz in the history of email. Outlook.com will be featured in ads running on primetime TV, radio stations, websites, billboards and buses. Microsoft expects to spend somewhere between $30 million to $90 million on the Outlook campaign, which will run for at least three months. The Outlook ads will overlap with an anti-Gmail marketing campaign that Microsoft launched earlier this month. The 'Scroogled' attacks depict Gmail as a snoopy service that scans the contents of messages to deliver ads related to topics being discussed. The Gmail ads are meant to be educational while the Outlook campaign is motivational, said Dharmesh Mehta, Outlook.com's senior director. Microsoft hopes the new outlook service will help it take on arch rival Google, who is the market leader in web email with its Gmail service . 'We are trying to push people who have gotten lazy and comfortable with an email service that may not be all that great and help show them what email can really do for them,' said Mehta. By Microsoft's own admission, Hotmail had lost the competitive edge that once made it the world's largest email service. The lack of innovation left an opening for Google to exploit when it unveiled Gmail nearly nine years ago. Gmail is now the industry leader, although estimates on its popularity vary. Google declined to comment on Outlook.com. The company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., plans to convert all of its Gmail users to its redesigned format within the next few months. Yahoo, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. revamped its email service late last year in an effort to provide a more consistent experience on personal computers and mobile devices. Outlook.com is the latest in a series of major product leases from Microsoft, which has been struggling to regain the cachet that once made it the world's most valuable technology company. Microsoft's Scroogled campaign accuses its rival of invading Gmail users' privacy when . scanning the contents of their emails to target them with personalised . ads. The attack, the latest . volley in Microsoft's Scroogled campaign, comes with a website and is . aimed to boost interest in the veteran software company's Outlook.com . email service. It follows a series of Scroogled adverts last year which targeted Google's controversial privacy policies. Scroogled! Microsoft's website to accompany its latest campaign taking a swipe at Google for its policy of scanning Gmail users' emails to target adverts .

'And there’s no way to opt out of this invasion of your privacy.' It also includes a feed of quotes from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt.

Constantinos Alexandrou, who played a part in foiling the 2006 bomb plot, is suing the Met Police after claiming he was later wrongfully arrested twice and falsely imprisoned . A man who helped MI5 and police convict airline bomb plotters for conspiring to murder hundreds of people in an Al Qaeda-inspired terrorist attack, has described how his co-operation and its aftermath led to series of incidents which ruined his life. Constantinos Alexandrou, 53, played a part in foiling the 2006 bomb plot, which was billed as comparable to the 9/11 tragedy, but claims he was later wrongfully arrested twice and falsely imprisoned. He is now suing the Met for aggravated damages having suffered stress and related problems due to the police action. MI5 handlers praised Mr Alexandrou for his part in the operation that stopped ten airliners, travelling form the UK to the USA and Canada, from being blown out of the skies by the terror cell. Mr Alexandrou, of Walthamstow, told Central London County Court how he assisted the police and security services by giving over his home for surveillance, as it was immediately opposite the bomb factory being run by the al-Qaeda-inspired plotters. But Cyprus-born Mr Alexandrou, who had no connection to the police before his involvement in foiling the trans-Atlantic bombings, said officers arrested him twice at the home they had taken over for the anti-terrorist operation. He also told the court about a third run-in with armed police, when he feared he was going to be shot, after they stopped him while walking through a park and demanded to see identification. His barrister Stephen Chippeck said: 'In the summer of 2006 one of the most dangerous conspiracies in the UK was taking place. A terrorist plot that entailed ten airliners travelling from the UK to the US and Canada was unfolding. 'This was the event that triggered all the airports everywhere into putting strict requirements into how much liquid people could carry onto aeroplanes. Mr Alexandrou (left) told Central London County Court how he assisted the police and security services by giving over his home for surveillance as it was opposite the bomb factory (right) 'All agree in this court room that the security services in this country do an important role and nobody is looking to undermine the role they play. 'Two police officers from the anti-terrorist branch of Scotland Yard came round to his house and looked round his home. 'They needed his assistance as a matter of national security and if he could help they would be very grateful as there was a terrorist cell operating in the area and that their plans were very advanced. 'He told them that he loved his country and would help in any way that he could. They asked to borrow his home and he persuaded his partner of 25 years to assist.' From left to right: Abdulla Ahmed Ali, Assad Sarwar and Tanvir Hussain, were found guilty of 'conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs' The court heard that his partner had not wanted to move out of the house and the strain led to their relationship breaking down. Mr Alexandrou was first arrested while trying to get back into his home after the police operation against the al-Qaeda-inspired terrorists had been reported as a success. He was advised to stay at a hotel for another week, following the arrests, but his partner moved out. After speaking to his solicitor he was advised to go back home, and checked with officers he would not be interfering with their work. He was arrested by police as he tried . to get in through a bathroom window after his partner had changed the . locks. He claims he was forced to sign a caution after spending more . than eight hours in a police station. The court heard he had signed the Official Secrets Act and did not want to disclose his involvement with MI5. After several months the caution was deleted. From left to right: Arafat Waheed Khan, Waheed Zaman and Ibrahim Savant who were found guilty of conspiring to murder hundreds of people in a terrorist attack . Following the first arrest Mr Alexandrou started sleeping rough under the bushes outside Wood Green police station, as he did not feel safe. His GP made arrangements for him to stay in a night shelter. After seeking legal advice Mr Alexandrou made his second visit to his home with a locksmith to gain access on September 19, a few weeks after his first attempt to return to the flat. He was arrested when police called a couple of hours later . Mr Alexandrou this time consulted a lawyer at the police station and told the officers of his involvement with the security operation and was released from police custody in about half the time of his previous arrest. Mr Alexandrou pictured outside the bomb factory . The court heard that Mr Alexandrou's ex-partner's name was on the mortgage at the property, but he told the court that he had lived with her at the address for 15 years and had always paid his way. The plot was the biggest terror investigation in the UK and intelligence officers believe it was directed by al-Qaeda figures in Pakistan. It led to changes in aviation rules worldwide that left passengers unable to take liquids into the cabin of passenger aircraft. Security officials on both sides of the Atlantic believe the men wanted to kill people in the air and possibly more on the ground in a wave of attacks causing more devastation than the 11 September attacks in the USA. On 7 September 2009, a jury at Woolwich Crown Court found Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28, Assad Sarwar, 29, and Tanvir Hussain, 28, guilty of 'conspiracy to murder involving liquid bombs' and therefore that the target of the conspiracy was the airline passengers. The plot was said at court to have been discovered by MI5 using covert listening devices in a flat in east London. Ali and Sarwar must serve at least 36 years, while Hussain was jailed for at least 32 years. In July 2010, Ibrahim Savant, 28, Arafat Khan, 28, and Waheed Zaman, 25, were found guilty at Woolwich Crown Court and sentenced to life in prison for conspiracy to murder. They must serve a minimum of 20 years in prison before being eligible for release.

Wealthy: The Duke of Northumberland has been accused by farmers on his estate-owned land of a 'get rich quick' attitude, after claiming they were hit by rent hikes of up to 98 per cent . He is the aristocratic owner of the castle featured in Harry Potter. And although his fortune is said to be around £320million, it seems the Duke of Northumberland wants more. Ralph Percy, 56, has been accused of wrecking the livelihoods of tenant farmers after his land agents demanded massive rent increases.Some have been asked to pay up to 98 per cent more or face eviction. The Duke, whose son George was last year rumoured to be dating Pippa Middleton, owns some 132,000 acres of land. His 1,000-year-old castle at Alnwick, which featured as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films, is known as the Windsor of the North. But despite his wealth, it emerged yesterday that the Duke’s Estate is conducting a crippling round of rent reviews on its farmers in Northumberland. There is no legal limit to the rent  the land agents can ask for, and tenants are unlikely to challenge them because this can end up costing them even more. With many farmers suffering from a slump in lamb prices, some fear they might have to give up their properties altogether. Stoker Frater, who runs two farms on land near Alnwick, has been told to expect a 40 per cent increase, following on from a 30 per cent rise three years ago. He said: ‘Tenants are expected to pay outlandish rents just to get the land. ‘The Estate has become so business-orientated that it will take the highest offer.’ Another, who also farms near Alnwick but did not want to be named, was told his annual rent was due to go up by 98 per cent this year. Hit: Farmer Stoker Frater, who farms on two Northumberland Estates-owned farms, has been told to expect a 40 per cent increase in his rent, following on from a 30 per cent rent rise three years ago . Grand: Alnwick Castle, the residency of the Duke of Northumberland, which was also used as a location in the Harry Potter films . After saying he could not afford it, . he was told to accept a 64 per cent rise or be off the land by the . following month. He said: ‘My rent will go up from £21,000 a year to . £34,000, which is completely unachievable. ‘This is affecting my entire family as I won’t be able to afford to run the farm if my rent goes up by this much.’ Northumberland Estates, which has . land in the West Country and Yorkshire as well as Northumberland, has . about 100 tenanted farms. It said the rent reviews reflected rises in . market rates. But David Robson, of the NFU in Northumberland, said the Estate was taking advantage of its tenants. He said: ‘It seems the Estate is . wanting its pound of flesh. Historically, they were run more on the . traditional basis where a farmer was actively encouraged to look after . the land. Now if the farmer can’t pay he’s out the door.’ The rises come as the Duke prepares . for a multi-million pound bill linked to the demolition of flood-hit . flats in Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne, although the Estate says the . issues are not linked. Tenants have the right to call in an . arbitrator if they dispute a rent rise, but can end up paying costs of . up to £40,000 if the ruling is in the landlord’s favour. An Estate spokesman said: ‘We . understand tenants do not welcome potential increases in rent but . believe that, by encouraging open and honest discussions during . negotiations, rent reviews take into account the type of tenancy, the . individual farm and rents accurately reflect market conditions.’","Duke of Northumberland nearly doubles rent for some farmers on estate .

Buddha statues have joined Barbie dolls and characters from The Simpsons as banned items in Iran. Authorities are confiscating Buddha statues from shops in the capital Tehran to stop the promotion of the religion in the country, according to newspaper reports. Iran has long fought against items, such as Barbie toys, to defuse Western influence, but this appears to be the first time that Iranian authorities are showing an opposition to symbols from the East. The Arman newspaper quoted Saeed Jaberi Ansari, an official for the protection of Iran’s cultural heritage, as calling the Buddha statues symbols of 'cultural invasion.' He said authorities will not permit a specific belief to be promoted through such items. Ansari did not say how many Buddhas had been seized, but that the 'cleansing' would continue. Some Iranians buy Buddha’s statues to decorate their homes and cars. Most are made in China and come from Iranian free-trade zones in the Persian Gulf. 'As I understand, none of customers cared about Buddhism, they only bought it for decoration,' said Reza Sanaei, a shopkeeper who sells the statues. A customer, Marjan Arbabi, said she . personally did not like the statues. 'But my parents have set of five . Buddha’s statues at their home simply because they think the statues are . beautiful,' she said. Write caption here . Under the constitution, Christian and Jewish beliefs as well as Zoroastrianism are recognized beside Islam, the official religion of the country. The law, however, says that, in general, the rights of all non-Muslims should be observed. Some Islamists do not support production of any statue, since they view it as a way to promote idols. In 2010, several statues depicted prominent Iranians, disappeared from Tehran city’s streets and squares. Their disappearance was blamed on an unnamed group with a strict interpretation of Islam that bans the depiction of the human form in art.","Buddha statues are being confiscated to stop promotion of the religion .

Mr Lavin said animals like this bull elk will not be targeted because people will not want to damage their cars . 'When people first hear about it — roadkill — some of them think this is a crazy bill, but it’s not,' Mr Lavin told the Daily Inter Lake. Officials at Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks are concerned potentially valuable carcasses, such as those of Bighorn sheep, . might be targeted for profit. Mr Lavin disputed this.

A primary school teaching assistant scammed £20,000 out of concerned colleagues after she tricked them into believing she had terminal brain cancer, a jury were told today. A fundraiser was even held to finance private Harley Street treatment for Ursula Rose, 42, and friends plunged themselves into debt by taking out loans or withdrawing money from their own childrens' accounts to help. The mother-of-four from South Norwood - who worked at the local Saint Thomas Becket school - denies she invented the illness, instead claiming the victims volunteered to help her through money troubles. Denial: Ursula Rose is accused of scamming £20,000 out of concerned colleagues after she tricked them into believing she had terminal brain cancer, a jury were told today . Prosecutor Claire Robinson told Croydon Crown Court Rose had . repeatedly made false representations to friends and work colleagues . that she was suffering from cancer, and that she had tumours in her head. She said: 'She did this to get their sympathy, to get loans of money from them. This was dishonest and calculated to make people feel sorry for her. 'Over a number of years she repeatedly told friends and colleagues that she was severely ill with cancer and she was doing it in order to gain money from people.' Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave the defendant £3,000 after Rose convinced her she feared dying on the operating theatre table during a £37,000 private operation and felt her husband would not cope financially, it was claimed. 'She told her and others that the brain tumours were growing aggressively and she was going for daily chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment' Miss Robinson said. 'She was told by Ursula Rose that one of the tumours was wrapped around a main artery near her temple and it could kill her at any moment. 'She said it was terminal and at level four and she needed an operation that was too dangerous for the NHS so was paying £37,000 to go private. 'Mrs Trype's two daughters had money in their savings and she borrowed that, intending to repay it with a lump sum from her pension,'  explained Miss Robinson. She said Rose took time off work for the non-existent 'operation' and when she returned told colleagues it had been partially successful, but a £7,000 American wonder drug could combat the remaining life-threatening tumour. 'Conned': Fellow teaching assistant Gillian Trype gave the defendant £3,000 after Rose said her husband would not cope financially if she died, it was claimed . Concerned colleagues: In June, 2009 fellow staff at Saint Thomas Becket school attended a fundraiser to raise money for a new 'miracle drug' for her . In June, 2009 staff attended a fundraiser at Croydon's Bar Txt, contributing to a collection aimed at raising money for the new drug. Another member of staff, Allison Patmore, gave Rose £6,500 as a deposit on a £40,000 private Harley Street operation - again claiming it was too dangerous for the NHS -  the court was told. Mrs Patmore took out a £6,200 loan, plus £300 cash from her bank account, accepting Rose's claim she would be repaid when her home was remortgaged. Rose told long-time friend Michelle Willis she had only six months to live and needed a strong dose of radiotherapy - knowing her pal had money remaining from a recent house sale. Mrs Willis gave her £5,000 and a few weeks later Rose asked for another £5,500 to avoid her home being repossessed. The friend convinced her own daughter, Sarah, to give Rose the money. Eventually the school's headmaster, Noel Campbell, received confirmation from Rose's doctor at Mayday University hospital that she never had cancer. 'He said she did not, and never had, brain tumours, but suffered from tension-like headaches.' Rose then resigned in February, 2010, telling the headmaster she had been given the cancer all-clear and was cured. She has pleaded not guilty to four counts of fraud, by falsely representing that she had a life-threatening illness, on various dates between September 30, 2008 and July 31, 2009.

Florida police are urging motorists to nominate a 'designated texter' in a bid to curb road deaths caused by using a mobile phone at the wheel. The scheme takes its cues from 'designated drivers', where revellers select one person to remain sober and drive their friends home after a night out. The idea is that passengers take control of a driver's smart phone and handle incoming texts, reports the Orlando Sentinel. Driving home the message: Orlando authorities have launched a 'designated texter' campaign to encourage motorists to hand their phone to a passenger instead of texting while driving. Pictured is a still from the ad campaign . The Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority says texting while driving can be as dangerous as drink driving and launched the campaign to increase public awareness of the problem and reduce the number of distracted drivers on the road. Oak Ridge High School senior Trevon Cleveland says that when his friends are driving, he encourages them not to send messages via text or check social media sites. 'I always ask my friends if they want me to send a text while they're driving, because I don't want them to put my life in jeopardy,' the 17-year-old said. The Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority launched the campaign to increase public awareness of the problem . 'I used to see one or two friends texting and driving, but now none of them do it anymore. 'I think it's great that they're avoiding a dangerous situation. Texting and driving really impairs you.' The authority is inviting people to take a pledge to be a designated texter and is also urging those who register to submit a picture and a story explaining why they have taken the pledge. 'We're hoping that people will take action and make the pledge,' Expressway Authority spokesman Jeff Marshall said. 'The goal is to motivate others to follow that behavior.' The campaign draws parallels between texting while driving and getting behind the wheel while drunk . It is estimated that drivers are 23 times more likely to have a car accident while texting. File picture . The road agency also has plans to develop a long-term plan with other local and national government agencies, as well as private companies, to curb texting by drivers. Officials will take stories from the pledge registry and 'provide that to legislators in Tallahassee who are pushing for laws to ban texting while driving,' Mr Marshall said. Florida is one of only a handful of U.S. states that hasn't passed a ban on texting while driving despite previous efforts. Critics say banning text messaging is going too far to regulate people's behavior inside their vehicles. The campaign does not specifically target youngsters, but research has found that younger drivers are more likely than others to text while driving. Steve Olson, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Transportation, said some drivers have already adopted the practice of appointing a 'designated texter'. 'I think a lot of drivers have a designated texter because there's too much going on in a car while a person is driving,' he said. 'Let's hope the campaign will reinforce that behavior.'","Florida authority urges motorists to hand over their phones while driving .

Marine General John Allen has announced he is retiring from the military to care for his seriously-ill wife, meaning President Obama will drop Allen's nomination to lead U.S. and NATO forces in Europe. Allen's request to retire comes just months after he was swept up in the David Petraeus sex scandal and accused of sending 'inappropriate' emails to a Tampa military social liaison officer, Jill Kelley. He was later cleared of any wrongdoing and has denied his stepping down is related to his part in the massive military scandal which led to the resignation of Petraeus, the head of the CIA. Stepping down: Marine General John Allen has announced his retirement from the military, declining a nomination for a role overseeing U.S. and NATO troops in Europe . Instead Allen, the longest-serving leader of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, has said he wishes to retire to take care of his wife Kathy, who suffers from a number of chronic health issues including an autoimmune disorder. 'For more than 35 years, my beloved Kathy has devotedly stood beside me and enabled me to serve my country,' Allen said in a statement released on Tuesday. 'It is profoundly sobering to consider how much of that time I have spent away from her and our two precious daughters. It is now my turn to stand beside them, to be there for them when they need me most.' He said he believes his wife's condition has deteriorated to a point where she would not be authorized to travel to Belgium, where NATO is based. He said that the new role would keep him away from his wife and their two daughters in West Virginia. Family: He said he is stepping down to care for his wife Kathy, left, who suffers from a series chronic health issues including an autoimmune disorder. One of his daughters, Bobbie, is seen right . 'For a long time, I told her, ""When you can’t bear this anymore, just . tell me and I’ll drop my [resignation] letter right away"",' Allen said, the Washington Post reported. But he said that he can no longer put the pressure of the decision on her, and is making the choice for both of them. 'Right now, I've just got to get her well,' Allen said. 'It's time to take care of my family.' Allen recently left a 19-month command in Afghanistan and was nominated last fall to become the U.S. military's top soldier in Europe. The nomination was shelved during a Pentagon investigation into emails Allen exchanged with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, who was linked to the scandal that forced CIA Director David Petraeus to resign. Scandal: Allen hit headlines last year after he was accused of sending 'inappropriate' emails to Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, left, who was friends with David Petraeus, pictured right with his mistress Paula Broadwell . When Kelley, who threw lavish parties . for top military brass at her Tampa home, received threatening emails . warning her to back away from her friend Petraeus, she alerted the FBI. During . a trawl of her email accounts, agents learned that the messages had . been sent by Petraeus'  biographer Paula Broadwell - and they also . discovered the pair had engaged in an affair. As agents looked through Kelley's emails, they also discovered thousands between she and Gen. Allen, and launched an investigation into messages sources called 'flirty' and 'inappropriate'. But last month he was cleared on wrongdoing and the White House said it would push on with his nomination to lead U.S. and NATO troops in Europe. Allen had admitted that the investigation took a toll on his wife and mother of their two daughters. Gen. James Amos, commandant of the Marine Corps, said that the probe had affected Allen, as he delievered a speech at the American Enterprise Institute recently. Over: The revelations about his affair sparked David Petraeus to step down in November, pictured . Retirement: Obama said he accepted the resignation of Allen, who lead forces in Afghanistan for 19 months . 'The stuff that took place as a result of the Petraeus fallout of that, took a pretty heavy toll on John, just because he's a man of such great integrity and his integrity was being questioned,' he said. President Obama accepted Allen's request to retire and called Allen one of  the nation's finest military leaders and a true patriot. 'I told General Allen that he has my . deep, personal appreciation for his extraordinary service over the last . 19 months in Afghanistan, as well as his decades of service in the . United States Marine Corps,' the president said in a statement. In Afghanistan, Allen managed 33,000 U.S. troops and oversaw the shift from counterinsurgency operations to the development of local security forces.","President Obama has accepted Marine General John Allen's resignation .

Workers from Britain, Italy and Greece were taken alongside four Lebanese colleagues, including two women, one of whom had a baby girl, police said. Location: The overnight attack, which first targeted a prison, happened in Bauchi state in northern Nigeria . The gunmen attacked a prison and set . two police vehicles on fire before killing a guard at the workers’ camp, . run by construction company Setraco. The kidnappers used explosives to force their way into the complex in the town of Jama’are, in Bauchi state, north-east Nigeria. Police said the group had attacked . the prison and trucks as a diversion before launching the raid on the . construction compound, its real target. Engineering: The attackers went to the Lebanese-owned construction site of Setraco, where they killed a guard and kidnapped the foreign workers, police said. The company's Facebook page is pictured . Foreign embassies have issued travel warnings over northern Nigeria for months. Abduction fears have risen in recent weeks with the French military intervention in Mali, as its troops and Malian soldiers try to rout out Islamic fighters who took over that nation's north in the months following a military coup. Last week, the U.S. Embassy in the capital of Abuja put out a warning following the killings of polio workers in the northern city of Kano and the killing of the North Korean doctors. ‘The security situation in some parts of Nigeria remains fluid and unpredictable,’ it said. Authorities in Italy, Greece and the . Lebanon said their nationals had been taken but the Foreign Office in . London is yet to confirm that a Briton was involved. Saturday night’s raid comes just a . month after six British workers were among at least 37 hostages killed . during a rescue attempt at a BP plant in Algeria. The kidnap of foreign workers for ransom has become a lucrative trade in Nigeria. While no-one has claimed . responsibility so far, Islamic extremists have carried out a bloody . guerilla campaign in the past year, including kidnappings and murders. The sect known as Boko Haram, whose . name means ‘Western education is forbidden’, has been blamed for killing . almost 800 victims last year. Last March a British hostage, Chris .

A disgraced former magistrate has been spared jail after fraudulently claiming more than £22,000 in expenses over five years, a court heard today. Carlton Janson, 69, made the false claims while sitting as a JP at Bolton Magistrates’ Court. He made false claims for loss of earnings to the tune of £20,585 and exaggerated mileage claims which came to £1,419 between 2006 and 2011, Burnley Crown Court heard. Carlton Janson thanked the judge who gave him a suspended prison sentence, and has promised to pay the money back within two months . Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, told the court that Janson began his career as a magistrate in April 2000 but that the fraud only came to light in 2011 when questions were raised about a 'financial loss allowance' claim he had made. Miss McAteer said checks are made on the claims of all magistrates but that 'there is a certain level of trust involved' in the system. JPs are not paid and are allowed to claim mileage and loss of earnings, the court heard. Janson claimed that the initial fraudulent claim was made in error but further investigations into his claims led to discrepancies being discovered as far back as 2006. He later told police he thought he could make the claims because he was working extra hours to make the time back. Bolton Magistrates court where Carlton Janson used to sit as a JP, but he was caught fraudulently claiming money . But his boss told investigators that Janson’s hours were flexible so no deductions had been made from his salary. Miss McAteer said Janson was claiming for loss of earnings even after he semi-retired in December 2008. Janson would also claim mileage of 19 miles for his trips to court even though his home was only two miles away. Andrew Nuttall, defending, said Janson was a man of good character who was remorseful, ashamed and embarrassed over what he had done and that he fully intended to pay the full sum back with the help of his family, who attended the hearing. Mr Nuttall said the offending began shortly after his only daughter died of cancer at the age of 34 in 2005. He said Janson was a 'decent, hardworking man' who never learned how to deal with the tragedy and lost his 'moral compass'. Mr Nuttall added: 'It cannot be a coincidence that these offences started just after he suffered a grievous loss in his family.' Janson, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to two offences of obtaining property by deception and two counts of fraud. Grey-haired Janson, wearing a navy . blue suit, walked into the dock with the use of a walking stick, and . said: 'Thank you, Your Honour' when Judge Andrew Woolman passed his . sentence of eight months in prison, suspended for two years. The retired buyer at Pharmatube in . Greater Manchester has pledged to pay back the full amount within two . months with the help of his family. Judge Andrew Woolman told the . defendant: 'You have brought shame and disgrace on yourself and your . family and it will take a lot of living down.' The judge said the shame and disgrace Janson had brought on himself was 'punishment in itself.' He added: 'You have, of course, . seriously let yourself, your family and the Bolton bench down. Magistrates are expected to behave properly and, of course, honestly.' But the judge said that Janson’s . actions 'did not take away' from the service he contributed to the bench . and said his poor health, which included 'mild Parkinson’s', depression . and arthritis, had been a mitigating factor. Judge Woolman told Janson the case would be brought back to court on May 20 if he failed to pay back the money. Janson thanked the judged and hugged his wife on his way out of court. The disgraced JP has sat on cases which have attracted media attention. Most notably he was chairman of the bench for the case of Jake Preston, a benefit cheat who claimed he could not walk but was secretly filmed throwing his motorbike around while racing to victory in a British motocross championship competition. Detective Constable Neil Tate, from Greater Manchester Police’s Volume Fraud Team, said: 'For more than 10 years Janson sat as a magistrate and performed an invaluable public service. 'Unfortunately we uncovered evidence that he was also stealing from the public purse since 2006. 'The cost to the taxpayer is considerable and his actions calculated and committed over a prolonged period of time. 'He perhaps thought that because he was in the privileged position of upholding the law he could break the rules or that they did not apply to him. 'They very much did and this case shows the police, CPS and courts will take positive action against those who break the law, regardless of their standing.'","Carlton Janson made false claims for loss of earnings of £20,585 .

A gang of scammers were found guilty of cheating £1million of jewellery and watches from top auction houses including Christie's and Bonham's today. Farouk Dougui, 39, Jabey Bathurst, 23, and Simohamed Rahmoun, 30, used stolen credit cards to buy the luxury items during a seven month scam. Rahmoun, who was on benefits at the time, splashed out on a number of expensive cars, including a Bentley convertible, Audis and Mini Coopers using profits from the crime. Guilty: Farouk Dougui . Guilty: Jabey Bathurst . Guilty plea: Simohamed Rahmoun . The gang used the credit card details stolen from people in Canada and the US to use false names to register with auction houses as telephone bidders. A nationwide investigation led by Wiltshire Police found that more than 40 companies across the UK were conned by the gang in a fraud worth more than £800,000 between April and November 2010. Dougui, from south east London and Bathurst, of Ruislip, Middlesex, were found guilty by a jury at Isleworth Crown Court of conspiracy to defraud following a six-week trial. Co-accused Rahmoun, of Chiswick, west London, pleaded guilty to the same charge during the trial. A fourth defendant, Barbara Goossens, 61, who ran a jewellery shop, was acquitted of conspiracy to defraud. During the trial prosecutors said Rahmoun and Dougui would contact auction houses and show an interest in expensive lots. The items they successfully bid for were picked up by courier Bathurst, who was using a false name. Robin Shellard, prosecuting, said: 'This is a case about a very modern way of stealing because it requires nothing more than the details of credit cards and often a convincing manner. 'The victims in this case are some of the country’s best known auction houses, provincial auction houses and also some little known jewellery shops. 'But when it comes to the victims of these crimes, the defendants were not overly concerned who they targeted as long as they had items of high value they could easily dispose of without getting caught.' He added: 'How the fraud was perpetrated was in fact, the prosecution say, remarkably easy as long as you had the right connections to obtain the credit card details in the first place and the knowledge of how the system worked and the gall really to carry out the deceptions.' Scammers: The gang fraudulently obtained luxury goods from 43 companies and auction houses including Christie's, left, and Bonhams, right . Dougui, Bathurst and Rahmoun were remanded in custody and will be sentenced on February 26. Detective Constable Amanda Carver, who led the investigation on behalf of Wiltshire Police, said after the verdict: 'The three offenders worked together in their plan to defraud by using foreign based fake credit cards to pay for valuable jewellery at a number of high-profile auction houses. 'They also purchased electrical goods and car parts. 'By the time the victims became aware the cards were fake, the offenders had collected the items which were worth many thousands of pounds. 'My investigation highlighted victim after victim and the true extent of their fraudulent activity only became clear when I collated all the similar offences from across the country and abroad. 'Companies across the UK were defrauded in excess of £800,000. This included businesses based in Salisbury, Swindon, Corsham and Trowbridge. 'The offenders used their criminal activities to fund a lifestyle that was way beyond their legitimate means. 'Rahmoun was claiming benefit at the time of these offences but had very high value cars at his disposal in Morocco and Spain.

Marriage counselor Sheila Loven told her client his marriage was over so he would have sex with her . A jury found marriage counselor Sheila Loven guilty of sexual assault today for having sex with a client while advising his wife to divorce him and turning them against each other. Sheila Loven, . 47, of Euless, Texas, had been taking John and Brenda Holliday, from Arlington, for joint . therapy in 2009 and recommended it would be better to have individual . sessions. The couple testified last week she took advantage of what she learned during sessions to deceive them both and coercing John Holliday to have an affair with her. Tarrant County prosecutors charged Loven, 47, with sexual assault, accusing her of breaking state law by using her influence as a counselor to coerce the husband into having sex in summer 2009. She will be sentenced later this week. She faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The first time the husband visited Loven's apartment after they had been out drinking together the night before in June 2009, she straddled him and kissed him, the court heard during testimony. He said he didn't feel good about it and it made him want his wife more. But he didn't believe there was any chance of getting her back after he sent her flowers, her favorite coffee and a muffin to her work to show her that he had been thinking about her. Her response was to tell him to never do that again, according to the Star Telegram. Loven also told him that his wife was through with him. Mr Holliday told the court that he believed his marriage was over because Loven told him it was. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A tearful Brenda Holliday took the stand last week and testified about her relationship with Loven, which she described as 'visiting my best friend once a week to talk' Sheila Loven counseled a couple in 2009 and allegedly used her counseling influence to encourage the wife to file for divorce, then had an affair with her husband, according to prosecutors . Threatening and profane text messages sent from Loven were also read out during the trial. After . the Hollidays reconciled, Loven is said to have sent them a number of . cruel texts until they went to police and reported her for harassment. One text message read: 'When are you going to figure out you are nothing without me. I made you into a man.' A message to the man's wife read: 'And then he talks about your body so bad while he's touching every inch of mine.' 'I hope you enjoyed your lunch. Didn't see me did you?' another text said. But . police turned the charge into sexual assault, saying the 47-year-old . used her influence as a professional counselor to persuade the husband . to have sex with her. Wife Brenda Holliday tearfully testified to the court last week that Loven became like a best friend to her and she believed she had found the perfect counselor, describing their visits like 'going to talk to my best friend once a week'. 'There was nothing I did not tell her,' the wife testified. 'I thought . that she genuinely cared about me and I told her how lucky I was to have . found her. She told me it was a God thing. She would always give me a . big hug before I left.' 'It wasn't marriage counseling, it was divorce counseling,' Mrs Holliday said in court. Mrs Holliday also revealed Loven told her that her husband was a 'narcissist' and had stopped coming to sessions and following her directions to save the marriage. All the while she was allegedly having an affair with him. Loven's . attorney said it was a legitimate relationship which blossomed from . romance and there is no evidence of emotional coercion. Adam Burny said: 'It had all the . elements of any other romantic relationship. They went out to nightclubs . and dinner, and they spent almost every night together. What you will . not see in this case is any evidence of manipulation.' But the prosecution argued there was . manipulation from the beginning - when she started to see them . separately to 'collect their secrets' and then using these secrets to . drive a wedge between them. Loven advised the wife to get a divorce and then asked the husband on a date. Days later, the pair began having sex. She . stopped office sessions with the husband but continued to have sex with . him, while continuing to counsel his wife, prosecutor Betty Arvin said. 'She was the ultimate inside trader,' Arvin said. 'She got information about their lives that they had never . shared with anyone and she used it, she twisted it for her own sick . reasons.' The wife also revealed yesterday that after she filed for a divorce and told her husband to leave the house, he pleaded to be allowed to return home and would call constantly, saying he was suicidal. The husband testified that he was so . depressed after the divorce papers were filed that he went only to work . and then returned home. 'I'd play Russian roulette with my .357,' the husband said. 'A couple of times I put it to my head and clicked it.' Mrs Holliday said that when Loven eventually confessed to her that she was the one having an affair with her husband, she said to her: 'For a year, you told me what a mess-up . he is, and you're a licensed professional counselor. 'Why would you want him? She said everything that she said . about him is what she loved about him. As she left, she hugged me and . told me that she loved me.' Testimony is scheduled to resume this morning in state District Judge Ruben Gonzalez's court.

Samsung's next Galaxy smartphone is set for a major screen upgrade that would make it the most high-definition mobile on the market, if leaks are to be believed. The launch of the successor of the SIII could be just a month away, and rumours of a major upgrade in the specs of Samsung's flagship phone are sweeping the internet. A document purportedly leaked by a Korean financial services firm claims the Galaxy SIV will boast a 5in 1920x1080 display, quad-core processor and run 2GB of RAM. Models brandish Samsung's Galaxy SIII in Seoul: The launch of the successor of the SIII could be just a month away, and rumours of a major upgrade in the specs of Samsung's flagship phone are sweeping the internet . That document, details of which were revealed by a report in TechRadar, also claims that the phone will run the latest version of Android Jelly Bean and will be released as soon as March. Other reports claim that the processor will in fact be an ARM-based Qualcomm model equipped with no less than eight cores and running at 2GHz. As far as cameras go, it is thought . that the Galaxy SIV will feature a rather standard 2MP front-facing CCD . and a high definition 13MP rear-facing one capable of . shooting HD video in 1080p at 30 frames per second. Might it look like this? It is more than a month since this picture which purported to show the next Galaxy S phone emerged. Commentators were quick to dismiss it as a fake . As rumours emerged that Apple is developing an iWatch to go with its iPhone, it was almost inevitable that claims would surface that Samsung is considering the same thing. Reports suggest the South Korean smartphone maker is considering a similar device as part of a secret initiative known as 'Project J'. The project is believed to include three devices, one of which is the Galaxy SIV, another the SIV mini, and a third which might be wearable. A report in SamMobile purported to reveal the details, expanded on by Slashgear with speculation that it could be a watch or a fitness device like the Nike Fuelband. 'Some of the same arguments we’ve made in favour of an Apple iWatch hold, to an extent, true for Samsung’s potential ""Galaxy Watch"",' wrote Slashgear reporter Chris Davies. The report included pictures of a concept device conceived of in 2009 by Johan Loekito in association with Samsung Design America which showed how such a device might look. Mr Davies added: 'With estimates that the wearables market will surge by 2017, Samsung’s involvement in the segment is probably unavoidable. 'That health-tracking gadgets are expected to lead that surge, and that Samsung already has its S Health service up and running, only makes it all the more likely that fitness and activity monitoring will be its initial foothold.' A report in Technorati claims that production will begin in March for an expected April release date - roughly a year since Samsung released the SIII, its current state of the art phone. Similar claims for the new device were repeated by mobile phone site SamMobile, which added that the phone would also feature a Mali-T678 (eight-core) graphics processing unit. It is more than a month since pictures which purported to show the next Galaxy S phone last emerged. They showed a gadget with a new design which, like Motorola's Razr i Android phone, almost entirely dispensed with buttons. However the image, first published by SamMobile, was almost immediately dismissed as a fake by rival tech blogs. 'It would be easy to enlarge the screen on a SGS3 press image using Photoshop, remove the home button and slightly reduce the size of the Samsung logo at the top,' said gadget site Pocket Lint at the time. 'Also, Samsung generally has more tricks up its sleeve than simply copying the same design year-on-year.' The expected release of the Galaxy S IV comes as Samsung are locked in a global battle for smartphone supremacy with arch-rival Apple, maker of the iPhone. The Silicon Valley firm are said to have been preparing several new versions of its iconic smartphone this year, including a cheaper, plastic-bodied model aimed at customers in emerging markets. Last week Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared to suggest that a less expensive version of their covetable but pricey gadgets might be in the pipeline. 'We are making moves to make things more affordable,' he said at the Goldman Sachs technology and internet conference in San Francisco. The revelation came after Mr Cook said that he saw a 'wide open field' because Apple's iPhone was currently 'only available to 50 per cent of [mobile phone] subscribers in the world'. The need for the company to diversify its offerings was underlined last month by a report which showed that the iPhone is losing its appeal among well-heeled Asian customers.","New Galaxy S IV phone will feature 1920x1080 screen, rumours claim .

John Yates has been accused of killing his estranged wife before taking her body to a police station. He denies her murder but admits manslaughter . A 'violent and abusive' man killed his estranged wife then turned up at a police base with her body in the back of his car, a court heard. John Yates, 58, of Padgate, Warrington, denies murdering his wife of 18 years, Barbara, a 49-year-old mother-of-two, last July. He admits manslaughter. Prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones told Caernarfon Crown Court how the couple were separated and Yates 'beat his wife to death'. Outlining the case to a jury, Mr Lloyd Jones said: 'He had been violent towards her in the past. He had displayed towards her a temperament which was controlling and possessive. He had shown he was jealous. When the defendant was interviewed by the police after his arrest he told them he didn't want to share.' He murdered her in a 'brutal' fashion, the jury was told. Counsel said : 'The defendant was violent and abusive towards her.' The violence and abuse went back 30 years. He said previously Mrs Yates had told her sister that her husband had locked her in a cupboard. In 1987 she was admitted to hospital after he allegedly punched her repeatedly, tried to strangle her, and banged her head on a car dashboard. In 2009 Mrs Yates decided she could take no more and left the defendant. But he was jealous of her new life. In 2011 she was taken to hospital after a 'prolonged assault' by him. At one stage he allegedly got a hammer and hit her over the head. 'Fortunately, it wasn't with great force,' Mr Lloyd Jones told the jury. 'He screamed at her ""you are going to die b*****"".' Yates had allegedly placed his hand over her mouth so she couldn't breathe but eventually she managed to calm him. Barbara Yates was murdered in a 'brutal fashion', Caernarfon Crown Court heard . 'She thought she was going to die is what she told a police officer,' the prosecutor said. Her face was bloodied and bruised and a friend said she hardly recognised her. Mrs Yates, a taxi escort for disabled children, had described how her husband went berserk after being refused sex. But she withdrew a complaint against him. Seven months later, on July 18, she was killed. Yates had been on police bail following an incident 13 days earlier when he stole 35 pairs of shoes and a new dress from her home. He'd put them on a bonfire. Yates drove to the North Wales police traffic base at St Asaph with the body of his wife in the boot of his car . Mr Lloyd Jones told the jury how Yates had turned up in his Peugeot 306 estate at the North Wales police traffic base at St Asaph where he spoke to a chief inspector. Mr Lloyd Jones said Yates told the officer: '""I need to hand myself in please, I have killed my wife. I have just had enough. I have mental health issues. She is in the back of the car"".' Mr Lloyd Jones said: 'The police looked and Mrs Yates's body was in the back of the car.' The jury heard there had been a prolonged assault and Mrs Yates suffered 'severe blunt force head, face and neck injuries' Home Office pathologist Dr Brian Rodgers concluded that there had been a prolonged assault and Mrs Yates suffered 'severe blunt force head, face and neck injuries'. Bones in her face had been shattered. There were multiple internal skull fractures. The doctor said there had been multiple blows using a weapon and from punches, and manual strangling. A hand may have been placed over the mouth. During police interviews Yates claimed he hadn't intended to kill his wife but told officers 'I lost my head'. Mr Lloyd Jones said: 'The issue is whether it was murder or manslaughter. The defendant apparently will be advancing a defence of loss of control.' The trial continues.

Mr Walker exposed the way in which meeting targets was prioritised over patient care and called for Sir David’s resignation for failing to intervene. The most powerful man in the NHS is already under pressure to quit over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal. On Friday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt attacked ‘institutional self-preservation’ in the Health Service while grieving families marched on Downing Street to call for Sir David’s resignation. Last night, Mr Bowles demanded Sir David be held to account for his role in ‘ignoring’ an imminent scandal at his trust, which is now under investigation over the deaths of 670 patients. In his letter of July 2009 to Sir David, Mr Bowles claims he was put under huge pressure to guarantee that the trust would meet its waiting-list targets ‘regardless of demand or any other factors’. He claimed staff at the strategic health authority ‘resorted to harassment and  bullying’ and ‘demanded without caveat... an unequivocal assurance or guarantee the non-emergency 18-week targets will be met in a manner which could be construed as an attempt to bully me and my trust into becoming a Mid Staffordshire and so put patient safety at risk’. Sir David responded to letters from Mr Bowles, Mr Walker and the trust’s board with a ‘sham review’ which failed to look into patient safety, the whistleblower claimed. He added: ‘I am qualified to say that having carried out my own analysis into the culture in other trusts. It didn’t touch on the safety issues. It didn’t touch on the issue of the breaches of the code around over-full hospitals.’ The father of two also claims he was ordered to sack Mr Walker, but refused and was forced out of his job. He was not made to sign a gagging order. However, he did receive a legal warning from the trust’s lawyers that stated he should not disclose the terms of the agreement sealing his departure. Mr Bowles added: ‘David Nicholson was warned by Gary Walker and by me that the trust would start slipping into Mid Staffordshire territory if the demands to meet non-urgent targets continued. ‘Gary was taken out and shot. After he was ousted, there were letters from clinicians saying that the balance between safety and targets had changed and safety was being compromised. Ousted: Whistleblower Gary Walker, left, was 'taken out and shot' after warning Sir David Nicholson, right, that United Lincolnshire Hospitals trust was 'slipping into Mid Staffordshire territory', according to David Bowles . 'If it’s the case that patients came to harm after those letters were written because of the mindless pursuit of non-urgent targets, then those who failed to act should be held to account.' He said his concerns about patient safety began in 2008 when staff started complaining about the conduct and behaviour of senior employees of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. ‘They complained of harassment and bullying and remorseless desire to meet targets at all costs,’ he added. 'I was told that I needed to meet targets regardless of the hospital being over-full. 'There was an unwillingness to understand that over-full hospitals are dangerous and a complete denial of guidelines that state that when hospitals are over-full, targets should be temporarily suspended.' Pressure: David Bowles said he was told to meet targets regardless of the fact that the hospital was over-full . He said he was horrified when Mr Walker told him he had been pressured to come off Red Alert, a declaration made when a hospital is too full to treat every patient. This culminated in Mr Bowles and the trust’s board writing a letter to Sir David warning of the dangers of breaching the guidelines. He added: ‘I was put under such pressure that I got the whole board, including Gary Walker, to refuse to put targets before patient safety. I remember Gary saying at the time: “I’m dead meat. They will come after me for this.” And sure enough, they did.’ He said when he raised concerns, it was made clear to him by Dame Barbara Hakin, who had been head of the SHA and is now head of commissioning for the NHS, that targets took precedence. She is under investigation for allegedly putting targets before patient care. A Department of Health spokesman said last night: ‘In 2009, Sir David swiftly commissioned an independent review to look at claims made by David Bowles and Gary Walker with regards to bullying and harassment by East Midlands SHA. ‘Allegations of this nature are taken extremely seriously. The review concluded there was no evidence whatsoever to back the claims and a summary of the review’s findings and Sir David’s response were published at the time. ‘Following concerns about the trust in 2009, Dame Catherine Elcoat, the SHA’s director of nursing carried out a full review into the quality of services. ‘The review concluded there were no immediate concerns in respect of patient safety, quality of care or quality of experience. ‘However, the review did confirm that there appeared to be a lack of strategic direction at the trust and that clinical governance arrangements were weak and action was taken to tackle this.’ An SHA spokesman said: ‘We completely refute any allegations that patient safety is not a priority at the SHA or that staff here were responsible for bullying and harassment.’","David Bowles told Sir David Nicholson United Lincolnshire Hospitals was under 'huge pressure' to meet non-urgent targets .

The Obama administration has radical plans for a multi-billion dollar, decade-long study into the workings of human brain, it was revealed today. According to The New York Times, the Brain Activity Map would be a collaboration between federal agencies, private foundations and leading scientists. Advocates for the project hope that exhaustive research into the brain's neurons would . produce insights that could be used to understand mental illness, help . treat diseases like Parkinson's and even enable . advances in artificial intelligence. Others have criticized putting large amounts of money into just one project and claimed that the study lacks clear goals. Advocates for the project hope that exhaustive research into the brain would produce insights that could be used to understand mental illness, help treat diseases like Alzheimer's, and even enable advances in artificial intelligence . Details are not yet final but the huge study is expected to be mentioned in the president's budget proposal next month. It still isn't known how much federal money will be needed or proposed for the project in straitened financial times. A comprehensive map of brain activity has similar scope to the Human Genome Project, which recorded all the genes in human DNA and was completed in 2003 at a cost of $3.8 billion. The brain map could certainly also end up costing billions of dollars. The New York Times quoted scientists involved in its planning who hoped that federal . financing would be more than $300 million a year - amounting to more than $3 billion over ten . years. In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama described brain research as an example of how the government should 'invest in the best ideas.' 'Today our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer’s,' said Mr Obama. 'They’re developing drugs to regenerate . damaged organs, devising new materials to make batteries 10 times more . powerful. Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in . science and innovation' the president said. In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama described brain research as an example of how the government should 'invest in the best ideas.' Obama also described how the Human Genome Project returned $140 to the economy for every $1 of investment in research. The Times reported on a federal study on the impact of the project that suggested that it had returned $800 billion by 2010. But there has also been criticism of the Brain Activity Map. The Atlantic referenced several Twitter users who 'expressed concern about the feasibility of the Brain Activity Map's . goals and wondered whether this is the best use of federal resources.' Leslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist at Rockefeller University, tweeted: 'Baffled by the NIH Brain Activity Map Project. We don't understand the fly brain yet. How will this come to anything?' Michael Eisen, a biologist at Berkeley, added: 'Someone has to go to congress and explain why basic research is so important, not pander to them with big science c**p.' As reported by The Atlantic, Eisen worked on the DNA research project ENCODE and he has since argued against 'Big Science' research. 'The lesson I learned from ENCODE is that projects like ENCODE are not a good idea,' he wrote on his personal blog. 'I think it is now clear that big biology is not a boon for individual discovery-driven science. Ironically, and tragically, it is emerging as the greatest threat to its continued existence.' The project would be on a similar scale to the Human Genome Project where scientists like Dr John Sulston, Director of the Sanger Centre near Cambridge (pictured) mapped every gene of human DNA .","The Brain Activity Map could cost over $300 million a year for a decade .

"By . Emily Davies . PUBLISHED: . 14:23 EST, 18 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:35 EST, 18 February 2013 . A man has been jailed for life after stabbing his girlfriend to death in a 'brutal, vicious and sustained attack' which was recorded in a terrifying voicemail message. Daniel Hodges, 31, admitted stabbing 39-year-old Gillian Andrade to death in a jealous rage following a night out in Loughton, Essex. The court sat in stunned silence as they heard a chilling voicemail message in which the mother-of-one pleaded for help just moments before she was brutally stabbed to death. Daniel Hodges lied that girlfriend Gillian Andrade stabbed him, even cutting his own neck to seem convincing . Hodges was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 17 and a half years, when he appeared in the dock at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday. Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 'Those close to her have been left with an un-fillable void. 'No one who sat in this court this afternoon and listened to that recording can feel anything but shock and horror. 'This was a brutal, vicious and sustained attack.' The couple had been enjoying a night out at Nu Bar - a popular nightspot for star of The Only Way is Essex in Loughton, Essex - on the night of the attack in July last year 2012. Hodges launched into a jealous rage when the couple returned from the night out and he discovered a text message from Miss Andrade's gym instructor who he wrongly believed had been having an affair with her. The court heard a harrowing voicemail in which jealous Hodges, who worked as an oil rigger, said: 'You're the last love of my life. You was my last love.' Miss Andrade can be heard calling out to her nine-year-old daughter just moments before she suffered two fatal stab wounds to her back. The cynical killer had tried to claim his partner had attacked him with the knife - even cutting himself in the neck after the attack in a twisted bid for sympathy before placing the knife in her hand. But the damning voicemail message eventually forced Hodges to confess to the killing when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court last month. SIO Det Chief Insp Lucy Robinson, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'The incredibly thorough investigation by my investigation team and the overwhelming evidence we gathered against Mr Hodges no doubt influenced his decision to enter a guilty plea. The couple had been on a night out at Nu Bar in Loughton Essex on the night of the stabbing . 'Daniel Hodges was a controlling man with a violent temper. Gillian was a woman who was full of life; a loving mother, daughter and sister. Gillian had been in relationship with Mr Hodges and she trusted him. He abused that trust and selfishly, through his own violent jealousy, took Gillian's life away from her family. 'Gillian's family now have to face a future without her. I hope today's sentence is some form of comfort to them. At least Daniel Hodges is unable to hurt anyway else through his violence whilst he serves a life sentence for her murder.' Gillian's mother, Mary Davey, paid tribute to her daughter following sentencing, saying: 'Gillian was a beautiful, kind person and anyone who came into contact with her couldn't fail to be touched by her positive outlook to life. 'The events of July 2012 have changed all our lives and we came today with no expectations other than to close this terrible chapter because nothing can ease our heartache or bring Gillian back. 'No sentence today can compare with the life sentence which was imposed on us last year and Gillian will always be loved and never forgotten. 'On behalf of my family I would like to thank Essex Police and Victim Support for all the help they have given us since this terrible event."" Grace Ononiwu, Chief Crown Prosecutor for East of England CPS, said: 'Hodges viciously murdered Gillian Andrade, a mother of one, in a jealous rage after mistakenly believing she was seeing someone else. 'His guilty plea reflects the strength of the prosecution's case, in particular a voicemail message that recorded his brutal crime. 'The guilty plea meant that the family and friends of Gillian did not have to go through a trial. 'I hope that the sentence today will bring some comfort to them at this difficult time.' Daniel Hodges was jailed for a minimum of 17 and a half years at Chelmsford Crown Court .","Daniel Hodges, 31, cut his own neck and lied girlfriend stabbed him first .

Millions of dollars earmarked for those struggling to get back on their feet after Hurricane Sandy has been held back from those in need because of banks' red tape. More than $200million of insurance money is being held back at some of America's biggest financial institutions, according to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office on Monday. Letters have reportedly been sent to  Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase by state officials telling them to speed up the release of funding. Scroll down for video . In need of help: A man stands on the debris of homes devastated by fire and the effects of Hurricane Sandy in the Breezy Point section of the Queens borough in New York .

Many victims of the disaster have not yet received much-needed funding, NY Governor Cuomo revealed today . According to CNN, thousands of homeowners are waiting on checks amounting to around $208million. Governor . Cuomo released a statement which said: 'Families need to be . able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit . from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs. 'After . insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the . money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape.' One reason for the hold up appears to be that banks often have to . endorse a check that comes from insurance companies, according to Cuomo. Putting the pressure on: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has asked several large banks to release money faster to those still suffering in the wake of Hurricane Sandy . The banks involved have not immediately commented. Hurricane Sandy caused at least 53 deaths in New York City and wreaked an estimated $42billion in damage. Around 100,000 homes suffered storm damage with more than 2,000 being declared uninhabitable. Across the U.S., Sandy is blamed for more than 130 deaths and tens of billions of dollars in property damage. Last month, President Obama signed a $50.5billion emergency measure for Sandy victims. The money is urgently needed to start rebuilding homes, businesses, public transportation facilities and other infrastructure damaged by the October 29 storm, one of the worst to strike the Northeast.",Hurricane Sandy hit in late October causing $42bn damage to NY .

"Hathaway denies manslaughter and his wife denies willful neglect of the child . By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 15:57 EST, 19 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:02 EST, 19 February 2013 . A man shook his five-week-old son so violently after losing his temper that it caused a fatal brain bleed, a court heard today. Simon Hathaway, 32, shook Jordan Hathaway . so severely that he stopped breathing and died within 90 minutes from . internal injuries, jurors were told. They heard that after the . assault the baby’s mother, Anne Hathaway, waited almost 40 minutes . before making an emergency 999 call to try to save their son. Hathaway denies manslaughter and his wife, Anne, 21, denies willful neglect of the child. Simon Hathaway, 32, (left) is accused of shaking his son so severely that he stopped breathing and died.  Anne Hathaway (right) then waited almost 40 minutes before making an emergency 999 call a court heard . Anne Hathaway, who was 19 at the time, was asleep upstairs in their one-bedroom home on February 22 2011 when the alleged assault is said to have happened, Reading Crown Court heard. She was shown her son when Simon Hathaway brought him to her and he was floppy and not breathing. Joanna Glynn QC, prosecuting, said that Anne Hathaway called her GP surgery at 8.47am and told the receptionist her son was not breathing. The receptionist advised her to call 999 immediately. 'She did not do that,' Miss Glynn said. 'The next clear point in time is 9.25am when we know that Anne Hathaway called 999. 'There was a delay of about 38 minutes between her calling the GP surgery and calling 999. 'The charge of neglect is her failure to seek medical help during the 38 minutes between the calls.' Miss Glynn said that Jordan, who was described before his death as thriving, healthy and a quite normal baby, would have been very unwell immediately after he was allegedly shaken, causing bleeding called a subdural haematoma. She told the jury that there was a 'golden hour' where aggressive intervention could have helped Jordan, but that the damage may have already been enough for him not to survive. The barrister explained said that Jordan had other 'crucial injuries' including fractures to both his legs and one arm and injuries to the back of his eyes that she claimed were caused by Simon Hathaway when he shook him. 'The Crown say that Simon must have lost his temper with him (Jordan) and shook him in temper, only briefly, and that is what caused the injury to his brain,' Miss Glynn said. Jordan Hathaway was shaken so severely that he stopped breathing and died within 90 minutes from internal injuries, jurors at Reading Crown Court were told . When Jordan was found by paramedics he was blue and had a weak pulse. He was rushed to hospital but died an hour and a half later. Both parents were arrested. Simon Hathaway denied any assault and said his son was fine but he had been crying that morning and had a big sneeze just before he became ill. He said that after the call to the GP surgery he became responsive again, flinging his arms around, and they thought he was fine. He said that Anne Hathaway went upstairs to get dressed as she was going to take him to the doctors but he collapsed again. Anne Hathaway had, in effect, given the same account, Miss Glynn said. But the barrister told the jury that the force used to inflict the injuries 'was beyond any normal or even rough handling' and that there was not medical evidence that a sneeze could cause such an injury. The trial of the pair, both formerly of Colnbrook, Slough, but now living in Hayes, west London, is expected to last three weeks.

If you don't like coffee or tea, Mountain Dew has a new breakfast drink that might perk you up. PepsiCo Inc. is rolling out a new drink called Kickstart this month that has Mountain Dew flavor but is made with 5per cent juice and Vitamins B and C, along with an extra jolt of caffeine. The company, based in Purchase, N.Y., is hoping to boost sales by reaching Mountain Dew fans at a new time of day: morning. Morning soda: Kickstart is a new take on Mountain Dew, with vitamins, caffeine and artificial sweeteners, designed to be consumed at breakfast time . PepsiCo said it doesn't consider Kickstart to be an energy drink, noting that it still has far less caffeine than drinks like Monster and Red Bull and none of the mysterious ingredients that have raised concerns among lawmakers and consumer advocates. But Kickstart, which comes in flavors such as 'energizing orange citrus' and 'energizing fruit punch,' could nevertheless give the company a side-door into the fast-growing energy drink market without getting tangled in any of its controversies. The drink comes in the same 16-ounce cans as popular energy drinks made by Monster Beverage Corp., which also offers options with juice content. And the TV ad features young men skateboarding, reminiscent of the marketing themes used by energy drink makers. 'It's a very interesting experiment capturing a number of attributes' Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer for PepsiCo's Americas beverages, says the idea for Kickstart came about after the company learned through consumer research that Mountain Dew fans were looking for an alternative to traditional morning drinks such as coffee, tea and juice. 'They didn't really see anything that fit their needs,' he said. Lowden said Kickstart was developed independently from a Taco Bell breakfast drink introduced last year that combines Mountain Dew and orange juice. PepsiCo says Kickstart, which is carbonated, is also not a soda because its 5 percent juice content qualifies it to be considered a 'juice drink' under guidelines set by the Food and Drug Administration. A spokeswoman for the FDA said the agency doesn't have definitions for what qualifies as a soda or an energy drink. With the growth of energy drinks such as Monster and Red Bull expected to slow, Kickstart could also signal the emergence of a new category that plays off the promise of energy and other health benefits, said John Sicher, publisher of the trade journal Beverage Digest. Caffeine-charged: Kickstart will be promoted by a TV ad featuring young men skateboarding, reminiscent of marketing themes used for energy drinks . In a nod to the growing concerns about sugary drinks, for example, Kickstart also uses artificial sweeteners to reduce its caloric content to about half that of regular soda; a can has 80 calories. 'It's a very interesting experiment capturing a number of attributes,' Sicher said, likening it to Starbucks' Refreshers drinks, which promise 'natural energy' from green coffee extract. The promise of 'energy' has been a big seller in the beverage industry in recent years, with the energy drink market increasing 17per cent in 2011 even as broader soft drink consumption has continued to decline, according to Beverage Digest. PepsiCo and the Coca-Cola Co. have largely watched that growth from the sidelines, however, with players such as Monster Beverage and Red Bull dominating the market. But the surging popularity of energy drinks has also led to sharper scrutiny. This summer, New York's attorney general launched an investigation into the marketing prices of energy drink makers including Monster and PepsiCo, which also makes Amp. Lawmakers and consumer advocacy groups have also called on the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the safety of the high levels of caffeine in energy drinks for younger people. Although Kickstart may look like an energy drink, it has far less caffeine, at 92 milligrams for a 16-ounce can. A comparable amount of regular Mountain Dew would have 72 milligrams of caffeine while a can of PepsiCo's Amp energy drink has 142 milligrams, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. By comparison, a 16-ounce cup of Starbucks coffee has 330 milligrams of caffeine.","Kickstart was inspired by the Mountain Dew and orange juice mix served by Taco Bell as part of its breakfast offering .

I was faced with a . dilemma – do it the easy or the hard way. 'I was determined not to put on any more weight and I wanted to lose it naturally. 'I was too self conscious to go to the gym so I decided to use the Wii Fit to exercise. 'For an hour every night I would do a running game or yoga or step-aerobics.

Although her condition has now improved, the Duchess has still been struggling to overcome her symptoms. She has already turned to natural food remedies, including Turkish figs and lavender biscuits sent to her by the Royal Family. One scent in which the candle, by Neom Organics, is available is English Lavender, Sweet Basil and Jasmine. The candles are expected to go on sale in the UK later this month, costing £39.50 each. They are made from essential oils and vegetable wax and work as 'aromatherapeutic treatments', the company says on its website.

Handyman Joseph Gentz, 48, was arraigned for first-degree murder yesterday after police arrested him more than a month after he admitted to killing marketing executive Jane Bashara. Gentz is also facing conspiracy charges, which likely mean authorities believe more than one person was involved, though that doesn’t indicate that person would be charged. Also today, Grosse Pointe police raided the home of Bob Bashara’s alleged mistress. Rachel Gillet, 50, had told police earlier that she and Mr Bashara were dating. Scroll down for videos . Stone-faced: Joseph Gentz was arraigned yesterday in court for first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder . Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month. He was arrested last Friday and charged with the murder of Jane Bashara . She was not named a person of interest in the case. Gentz was released last month from the Detroit prison after police claimed they not find enough evidence against him. His release was yet another bizarre twist in the murder mystery of Ms Bashara, who was found dead in January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home. ABC News reported that five unmarked police cars surrounded Ms Gillet’s home early this morning, and left around four hours later carrying seven cardboard boxes, a paper bag, and an additional evidence box. The building’s landlord, Phyllis Huxley, told ABC News that she never received a warrant and was not asked permission before officers entered the home. Meanwhile, Gentz’s court-appointed attorney Susan Reed told the Detroit Free Press that she hasn’t discussed a plea deal with her client. Attorney David Griem said he was unsure if his client Bob Bashara would be charged in the case. ‘I don’t have a crystal ball,’ he said. Nevertheless, he speculated: ‘I guess the next step is to offer Joe Gentz a deal he can’t refuse to testify against Bob Bashara.’ Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair . Gentz was already wearing blue prison . attire at the time of his arraignment Monday afternoon. CBS Detroit’s . legal analyst speculated that Gentz’s arrest would by no means be the . last in this case. ‘Conspiracy means by definition, some . other person. I cannot conspire with myself to commit murder. I need . somebody else. And the big question of the day: Who is that person?’ Ms Bashara’s husband Bob, 54, has . been in the public eye for his place in the murder, for one because . police discovered a secret S&M dungeon in one of Mr Bashara’s . properties, and more significantly because Gentz told officers that Mr . Barshara requested the hit on his wife. Mr Bashara, who remains a person of . interest, maintains his innocence. Last month, he told ABC News . exclusively: ‘I did nothing wrong. I didn’t commit murder. I didn’t pay . to have my wife killed. I’m going to see this through to the end. And . I’m innocent.’ Meanwhile, Gentz remains in jail, and pending a competency evaluation, will appear in court March 16 for a preliminary exam. Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge . When police first began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported. Murdered: Jane Bashara was strangled in the back of her Mercedes SUV in January . Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder. Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible. Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death. Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family. 'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press. Bashara initially told police about the night his wife died: 'I got home and she wasn’t . around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Mr Bashara told 7 Action News. 'As . 9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more . people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard . from her and they hadn’t. 'I . had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I . involved the police because I was concerned there might be something . wrong.' After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing. 'Accomplice': Joe Gentz told police he was paid less than $2,000 to murder Jane by her husband . Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to a run-down version of Detroit . Speaking to the Detroit Free Press last week, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and . did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere. 'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through . in the last moments of her life.' Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company. The Detroit News reported that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities. 'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'

Short-haul air passengers who are delayed by more than three hours can expect to be compensated after airlines lost a legal fight in the European court. A number of airlines, including British Airways and easyJet, had challenged a 2009 ruling that passengers on flights to and from Europe should be compensated if they are delayed for more than three hours. Today the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg confirmed the 2009 ruling after the airlines had challenged the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) over the matter. Pay and delay: Airlines will have to compensate delayed passengers after losing their legal challenge . There will still be exceptional circumstances where compensation will not have to be paid, such as industrial action and extreme weather. But there are a number of compensation cases that have been put on hold since 2009 for which carriers might now have to pay out. Passengers on flights starting or ending in the 27-country European Union are entitled to between 250 euros (£203) and 600 euros for delayed or cancelled flights under EU rules. They also apply to any flight outside the EU which takes place on an airline company based in the Union . Today's judgment was welcomed by the CAA which said the situation was now clearer for passengers. CAA regulatory policy director Iain Osborne said: 'Every year around 200million passengers travel on two million flights to and from the UK, with the vast majority experiencing no problems. 'However, when something does go wrong, there are regulations in place to protect travellers, and the CAA is ready to ensure companies abide by them. 'Today's judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union offers much needed clarity for passengers, the airline industry and the CAA about when compensation must be paid following delays.' Reaction: easyJet said it was 'disappointed' with the decision, while British Airways noted it was 'aware' of today's ruling and will comply . A British Airways spokesman said: 'We are aware of the ruling and will continue to comply with the regulations.' Travel company Tui, which was involved in the legal challenge, said: 'We note today's ruling by the ECJ. 'We are committed to treating our customers fairly and will continue to work with the European institutions to ensure that the underlying legislation is revised such that it strikes the right balance for passengers and airlines.' An easyJet spokesman said: 'We are disappointed with the outcome but we are pleased we have final clarification and certainty on this issue. We will do everything we can to ensure our passengers do not have delays. Our priority is to look after our passengers.' The ECJ was ruling in a case involving German carrier Lufthansa and another involving TUI Travel, British Airways, easyJet and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In 2009 the ECJ ruled that compensation should be payable by airlines at the same rates as for cancelled flights, but not if the delay was caused by 'extraordinary circumstances', in a case involving Air France. At the time, it declared: 'There is no . justification for treating passengers whose flight is delayed any . differently when they reach their final destination three hours or more . after the scheduled arrival time.' The ruling arose from a 2009 case involving Air France. The ECJ found that air travellers delayed for three or more hours should be compensated the same as those whose flights are cancelled . In the Lufthansa case, passengers sued the airline for compensation in a German court after a flight delay of more than 24 hours. Judges subsequently sought advice from the ECJ. In the second case, IATA, British Airways, easyJet and TUI Travel challenged the UK Civil Aviation Authority after it rejected their request to be exempted from paying for flight delays. British judges then asked the Court of Justice in Luxembourg for guidance. The compensation will also apply even if passengers are re-routed by the airline on another flight and still arrive three or more hours late. The ruling arose from cases referred from German and Austrian courts in which passengers claimed compensation after facing delays - but not cancellations - which meant they arrived at their final destinations 25 and 22 hours after the scheduled time.","European Court of Justice confirms airlines must pay up .

A two-year-old boy from Georgia is fighting for his life after a gust of wind from Superstorm Sandy snapped a large tree limb that fell on him Monday. Tripp Halstead, a sunny toddler with spiked blonde hair, was playing behind his Winder day care center when the 10-foot tree branch struck him in the head. The child sustained a brain injury and has been in a medically induced coma at the Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston after undergoing emergency surgery. Fighting for his life: Both sides of two-year-old Tripp Halstead's brain were injured when a large branch was blown off a tree and hit him in the head . Tripp’s favorite toy, Lightning McQueen, is in his hand as he remains unconscious. A family friend set up a Facebook for Tripp's parents, Bill and Stacy Halstead, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking people to pray and donate money for his recovery. The family have said that they have been overwhelmed with support from thousands of well-wishers, many of them strangers who have heard about Tripp’s plight from media reports, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution. By Friday afternoon, the Tripp Halstead Updates page has attracted more than 15,700 fans. On Thursday, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news. 'His injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the lasting damage could be,' the message read. Bubbly: Tripp was playing outside with his classmates when the branch came from nowhere and struck him down . Gratitude: Tripp's parents Bill and Stacy Halstead (pictured) have thanked people for their continued support in their time of need . Scene: The accident happened while Tripp was enjoying his recess with friends at the Cribs To Crayons daycare center . This morning, the family posted another update with more bad news. 'His swelling is back up and his drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to pray. We still need a miracle.' The boy's mother, Stacy Halstead, called her son a miracle baby, explaining to WSB-TV that she and her husband had struggled for a long time to conceive until finally she became pregnant with Tripp, their one and only child. On Monday, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. A strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and administered CPR, but the damage has been done. Miracle baby: Tripp's parents Bill and Stacy said they struggled for some time before having their only son . Heavy: A strong gust of wind ripped the branch from the tree before it landed on Tripp . Since the accident, the boy's family have been on a roller coaster ride, going from positive signs, like a brief reduction in pressure around his brain, to serious complications, among them problems with his breathing. On Friday afternoon, a desperate plea appeared on the family's Faceboook page asking for prayers.

A businessman who spent £1million building a classic World War II Spitfire with parts found around the world has spoken of his joy at seeing it take to the skies after 13 years. The iconic Second World War fighter plane was meticulously pieced together  after its fuselage was rescued by 51-year-old Martin Phillips a decade ago. Mr Phillips, from Newton St Cyres, Exeter, had been challenged to build his own Spitfire by friends who gave him a single rivet from the aircraft. Scroll down for video . Restored classic: The rebuilt Spitfire took to the skies above Bristol last month after a painstaking £1m renovation . The 53-year-old businessman from Exeter, Devon, with the rivet which was the inspiration behind the restoration of RR232 . And when he found the fuselage of a 1944 Mark IX Spitfire, RR232, in West Sussex, the restoration began in earnest. Mr Phillips gathered more genuine Spitfire parts from around the world - including four of the Merlin engines which gave the Spitfires their unmistakable sound. He also found a £70,000 four-bladed propeller, wing skeletons, engine parts, wing cannons, flying instruments, original seats and components. One of its wings came from a Spitfire that crashed near Exeter Airport and lay for decades in a hedge near a pub until it was salvaged. Last month, 13 years after the challenge the . gleaming Spitfire took off from the soon-to-close Filton aerodrome . outside Bristol for the first time since the 1940s. Flying through British skies for the first time since the 1940s: The restored Spitfire over Bristol . Taking off: The gleaming aircraft attracted large crowds to Filton airfield near Bristol . Martin Phillips in his workshop pictured with a Spitfire tail plane, for his next project . Determined: Martin Phillips was challenged to build his own Spitfire by friends who gave him just one rivet of the aircraft for which he had to find the rest . Filton has been synonymous with aviation development since before World War One when the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company set up a flying ground there in 1911. The firm developed the iconic Bristol Fighter and the airfield was used by the Royal Flying Corps during the war. Between the wars, the firm became Bristol Aeroplane Company and built aero engines, while Hurricane fighters were based at Filton. During World War Two, BAC expanded massively, producing the Bristol Blenheim and Beaufighter, two medium-range twin-engine bombers. Spitfires were also based at the grass airfield for a time following heavy bombing of Bristol. After the war, Bristol continued to develop planes, by now branching out into commercial aviation and extending the concrete runway to cater for larger airliners. Filton's crowning glory was arguably its role in the development of Concorde, in the 1960s and 1970s, by now under control of the British Aircraft Corporation. Pictured above is the famous supersonic passenger jet visiting the airfield for the last time in 2003. In 1977 BAE acquired the airfield and it was recently used to produce the Bae 146 small airliner. Mr Phillips, who owns the Spitfire, said the expensive and painstaking restoration project with his 50-strong team had been worth it. He . said: 'Many times I thought the project wouldn't ever be completed. But we never gave up the ghost. 'The Spitfire is something that makes . Britain a great nation. I am humbled that 18-year-old kids went up in . them and died in them.' The occasion was a poignant one as . Filton aerodrome was decommissioned by BAE after more than a . century of aviation there. It closed on December 31. BAE . Systems, which said the site was no longer economically viable, is . selling the airfield for housing and business development. Crowds . of aviation and history enthusiasts lined the A38 road which borders . the airfield to watch the Spitfire take off, while BAE staff watched . from beside the runway. They . were also there to see the last visit to the airfield from the Airbus . A380 superjumbo, which was developed at Filton and is the world's . largest commercial aircraft. Mr Phillips said: 'To see her take to the skies today has been extraordinary, for it to happen at the same time as an A380's final visit to Filton, . has made this a sad but historic day. 'I think it's a terrible shame that this famous old airfield is to close.' Former Rolls-Royce engineer John . Hart, who has worked as chief engineer on the Spitfire restoration for . the last two-and-a-half years, said seeing the Spitfire and the A380 . together on the runway that is also still overlooked by Concorde was . 'quite a sight' for aviation enthusiasts. He said: 'It's funny to think the last aeroplane to be put together here at Filton has turned out to be a Spitfire.' Filton . aerodrome, which has one of the longest and widest runways in the . country, witnessed the first test flights of Concorde and was where . American soldiers injured in D-Day were taken to before being treated at . Bristol's Frenchay hospital. The West Country's aviation industry grew up around the airfield, which developed an international reputation. Devoted owner: Exeter businessman Martin Philips spent £1m restoring the Spitfire after it was found 10 years ago in a junkyard . Preparing for take-off: Aeroplane enthusiasts lined the runway to watch the WWII fighter plane take to the skies . Painstaking work: The Spitfire has a fully rebuilt Rolls-Royce Merlin engine . Race to finish: Engineers worked long hours to finish the Spitfire's restoration in time for it to fly from Filton . During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vulcan bombers were stationed there, and the last Concorde to fly, Concorde 216, is parked there. There are plans for an aviation museum on the site, hosting both Concorde and the Bristol Aero Collection of British-designed aeroplane memorabilia from the last century. The final flights from Filton will took off in December, before the aerodrome was decommissioned.

A mild-mannered man who was transformed into a gun-toting bank robber straight out of The Sweeney by the effects of an undiagnosed brain tumour has had his indefinite jail sentence overturned. Trevor Hayes, 47, was sentenced to imprisonment for public protection in July 2011 after pulling off a string of terrifying robberies, during which he put a sawn-off shotgun to the heads of customers in a Post Office and bank, bagging nearly £50,000. Hayes, of Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, a man whose previous record consisted largely of ‘petty theft’ and to whom violent action was ‘out of character’, also used the illegal gun to threaten two motorists in a layby off the A404, making off with a van which he later used as a getaway vehicle. Terrifying: Masked Trevor Hayes put a sawn-off shotgun to the heads of customers in a post office and bank, before fleeing with nearly £50,000 . Hayes – who pleaded guilty to three . counts of robbery, various firearm offences and arson at Oxford Crown . Court – was jailed indefinitely after Judge Gordon Risius decided he was . a dangerous offender who posed a serious risk to the public. But Lord Justice Davis, Mr Justice . King and Mr Justice Kenneth Parker, sitting at London’s Criminal Appeal . Court, have overturned that finding after hearing that, six months after . he was jailed, a large brain tumour was found to be the cause of his . ‘aggressive and compulsive behaviour’. The court heard that, under the . influence of the tumour which was pressing on his frontal lobe, Hayes . carried out two brutal armed raids in Oxfordshire. Appeal: Hayes, 47, from Henley on Thames, Oxfordshire, captured on CCTV images during one of his raids, had his indefinite jail term overturned after top judges found that an undiagnosed brain tumour had turned him from a mild mannered man into a dangerous criminal . He also lurked in a layby, . threatening drivers who were taking a comfort break on two separate . occasions, taking a van belonging to one of them. Barrister Jonathan . Rose told the court yesterday that it was not until Hayes was behind . bars that his condition was discovered and the tumour removed. Mr Rose presented a medical report to . the court, in which a doctor explained the “unusual scenario” and said . that, having undergone surgery, Hayes is no longer violent or a risk to . the public. Saying Hayes’s violent actions had . been ‘out of character’, the barrister concluded: ‘The concern is no . longer there. It is such an unusual scenario.’ Transformed: Armed bankrobber Trevor Hayes, pictured, became an armed robber because of a massive undiagnosed brain tumour, the Court of Appeal said . Lord Justice Davis said: ‘There is a . direct link between the size of the tumour and his behaviour. The . evidence appears to be clear.’ Quashing the indefinite sentence, Mr . Justice King replaced it with an 11-year jail term, of which Hayes will . serve half before qualifying for automatic release. The judge said that he had not . reduced the sentence any further because the medical report had not . concluded that Hayes had not realised he was committing crimes. He said: ‘He knew what he was doing was wrong.’ Out of charachter: The judges decided the massive tumour had been pushing on Hayes' frontal lobe, changing his behaviour . Discovery: The Court of Appeal, pictured, was told that it was not until Hayes was behind bars that his condition was discovered and the tumour removed by surgeons .","Trevor Hayes, 47, was jailed indefinitely for a string of terrifying robberies .

Angry locals in a small outback town today questioned the motives of British teenager Sam Woodhead who set out for a desert run and then had to be rescued. Mr Woodhead, 18, was lost in the outback for three days after setting out for a late afternoon run last week and was just a few hours from dying when rescued by a helicopter crew. And while residents of the town of Longreach are delighted that he was found and is now recovering in Brisbane with his mother, Claire, they were critical today of his motives when he set out for the ill fated run. 'Life-threatening': Sam Woodhead was reunited with his mother Claire Derry in Longreach, Queensland, when he was rescued after spending three days missing in the Australian outback . 'Just a few things don't add up,' said Norman Philp, who had been involved in other outback rescues. 'You get a feeling he wanted to go bush.' Mr Woodhead's mother and his family in the UK have already said that the teenager is a Bear Grylls fan and wanted to go into the Marines. Survival expert Bob Cooper told Brisbane’s Courier Mail that visitors must be told that the outback is life-threatening – and that there are rarely any second chances. He said local people should try to ensure that visitors to the outback are warned of the dangers. ‘We need ourselves to be more responsible in our attitude to visitors and visitors to the outback, whether they’re from the city or overseas,’ he said. ‘They make it into a challenge and it’s more than that. It’s not challenging – it’s life-threatening.’ Dangers: Mr Woodhead was airlifted to hospital in Longreach after being rescued from the desert . 'Run that went wrong': Some locals in Queensland suspect the Bear Grylls fan may have deliberately set out to test his endurance in the outback . Hero: The teenager is accused of apeing survival hero Bear Grylls . Mr Philp and Mr Cooper are among Queensland residents who have questioned whether Mr Woodhead had deliberately set out to challenge his endurance when he left the Upshot cattle station where he had been staying for the previous 10 days. When he jogged off in his shorts and running shoes, he was also wearing a backpack containing clothes. He said after his rescue that he had been using the bag to add weight to his body while he was on his jog – a run, he said, that was ‘just a run that went wrong.’ He has already told how he became lost and after drinking all the water from a bottle he had carried he resorted to drinking small bottles of contact lens solution he had in his backpack. He had also tried drinking his own urine. The run, he had chosen, he said, had seemed more interesting than running around the small airfield that he had been going around on previous days. Local resident Adrian Roots has joined several others in questioning Mr Woodhead’s motives. ‘From what his mum told us about him wanting to be in the Royal Marines and being a big fan of Bear Grylls, that’s probably why people are angry, thinking that’s what he was doing,’ Mr Roots told the newspaper. ‘There’s just the unanswered questions.’ Lloyd Mills, who is based in Longreach as the general manager for Outback Queensland Tourism, said it was the responsibility of tourists to research the dangers of the outback.","Sam Woodhead, 18, spent three days lost in Australian outback .

Bond girl Berenice Marlohe missed the London Skyfall DVD launch after her plane to the UK was forced to make an emergency landing because of a suspected toxic oil fume leak. The 33-year-old French actress - who played Severine in the hit film - was on her way to join her Bond co-stars on a specially branded train from London's King's Cross to Edinburgh to promote the UK DVD release of the movie. But Ms Marlohe and her fellow 265 passengers - including American . Idol host Ryan Seacrest and his girlfriend, the singer and actress . Julianne Hough - were not even one hour into the journey . from Los Angeles to Heathrow when it was forced to land after . passengers and crew started to feel unwell. Mid-air drama: Bond girl Bernice Marlohe, who starred alongside Daniel Craig in Skyfall, was on her way to promote the UK DVD release of the film in London when her British Airways flight was forced to make an emergency landing . A Skyfall spokesman said: 'It was a shame Berenice was unable to attend our launch where she was due to unveil the Skyfall train with her fellow Bond actress Naomie Harris. 'Sadly Berenice's plane was grounded in Las Vegas due to fumes in the cabin.' The captain of the British Airways  Boeing 747 had become concerned after crew and business class customers were affected early on during the flight on Thursday. All three pilots and four cabin crew . had to be taken to hospital for checks, while a number of passengers . were treated by paramedics, after emergency services met the aircraft in . Las Vegas. On board: TV personality Ryan Seacrest and his actress girlfriend Julianne Hough were on the flight forced to make an emergency landing . A film insider . told The Sun: 'It must have been a scary experience for her. We're just . pleased to hear everybody got off the plane safely.' Following . the incident, a BA spokesman said: 'Safety is always our top priority . and as a precaution, the Captain decided to divert our Los Angeles to . London service into Las Vegas, following a suspected technical problem. 'Our pilots used their training and experience throughout and the flight landed normally at Las Vegas. 'We provided hotels for the customers and we will be rebooking customers onto alternative flights out of Las Vegas as soon as possible.' The news comes just one week after it was revealed a BA Boeing 777 was forced to make an emergency landing in Canada, as it made its way from Heathrow to Philadelphia, after suspected toxic oil fumes were reported on the flight deck. In that instance the plane, carrying 158 passengers, made the unscheduled stop at Goose Bay, in Newfoundland, in temperatures of -30C. British Airways said the latest aircraft has been taken out of service for investigation. It said there were early indications which pointed to a 'fault with the number three engine', according to the Sunday Express. A spokesman said: 'The engine's maintenance programme would, of course, be in accordance with the manufacturer's regulations. Safety is always our top priority.' Scary experience: Berenice Marlohe was one of the 266 passengers on board the LA to London flight when it was forced to land because crew and passengers began to fell unwell . The spokesman apologised to the passengers on Thursday night's flight and said: 'The smell could only be smelt on the upper deck and 20 business class customers in that area were informed of the situation. There was no unusual smell on the main deck.' Three weeks ago the first picture was released of one of two top BA pilots who died within days of each other after complaining about being exposed to toxic oil fumes on passenger planes. It was reported last month that Richard . Westgate, 43, died after instructing his lawyers to sue BA for health . and safety breaches days before fellow pilot Karen Lysakowska, 43, . passed away. Both claimed they had been poisoned by . the fumes that can contaminate cabin air and which regularly force . pilots to wear oxygen masks. A British Airways Boeing 747 was less than an hour into a trip from Los Angeles to Heathrow when it was forced to land again due to suspected toxic oil fumes (file picture) Mr Westgate's lawyers want to 'give him the trial he never got' by suing the airline in a case they say will be a 'moment of truth' for the aviation industry. They say they are on the cusp of proving in court the existence of 'aerotoxic syndrome', a chronic physical and neurological condition they insist will one day be seen as 'the new asbestos'. Thousands of pilots are currently 'unfit to fly', one specialist doctor has claimed. A BA spokesman said: 'Our thoughts are with the families of the two pilots at this very sad time and we offer our sincere condolences. 'We are not aware of any legal claims relating to the two individuals. It would be inappropriate for us to comment or speculate upon the individuals' cause of death.' BA has said it is not aware of any link between the deaths and the latest incident.

A two-year-old boy who was left . fighting for his life after a gust of wind from Hurricane Sandy caused a . tree limb to fall and hit his head has contracted a life-threatening . illness while in hospital. Tripp Halstead, from Georgia, has . been hospitalized since the October 29 incident outside his daycare center after sustaining a brain . injury which left him in a medically induced coma. But last week, as his treatment continued more than three months after the storm, he contracted bacterial meningitis, his mother said on Facebook. Injuries: Tripp Halstead, who suffered head injuries in Hurricane Sandy, has now contracted bacterial meningitis . Battle: Tripp has been in hospital ever since the accident and contracted the condition during an emergency operation last week to remove a pump administering medicine to his brain . 'Tripp has bacterial meningitis, which is . very life threatening,' Stacy Halstead wrote. 'Words can’t describe what we are feeling except . total heartbreak. 'I have just been staring at that sweet little face. To think we had come so far, then to get the scare that he might have a life-threatening infection and we might lose him. Worst day to boot so far.' She has previously spoken out about how she and her husband struggled to conceive their only son. Bacterial meningitis usually affects brain trauma patients in intensive care, Dr. Bill Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told ABCNews.com. It usually occurs when bacteria gets into fluid surrounding the brain and even when hospitals use clean equipment, there is always a risk the bacteria could be transferred, he explained. Happier times: Tripp is the only child of Bill and Stacy, who have been updating friends on Facebook . Before the accident: Tripp, who was an energetic toddler, is now confined to his bed or a chair . Every time you breach the body's protective surface you run the risk of an infection getting from the outside in,' Schaffner said. 'The longer you’re in an intensive care unit, the higher the risk is.' Tripp contracted the infection after he underwent an emergency surgery on Thursday to remove a pump that had been inserted into fluid around his brain to administer medication. Schaffner said he expected the boy would receive antibiotics to fight the infection. His mother added that her son is 'such a little trooper and hanging in there'. Just days earlier, his family had taken to Facebook to ask the group's 238,000 followers to pray for Tripp as he underwent emergency surgery to remove the pump. Heavy: A strong gust of wind ripped the branch from the tree before it landed on Tripp . Struggle: The youngster was rushed to hospital but had suffered severe damage to his head . On October 29, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. A . strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy . in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and . administered CPR, but the damage had been done. When he was rushed into Children’s . Healthcare of Atlanta on the day of the incident, he had emergency . surgery to relive swelling around his brain from where the branch struck him on the head. A . family friend set up the Facebook group for Tripp's parents, Bill and . Stacy, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking . people to pray and donate money for his recovery. The . family said they have been overwhelmed with support from thousands of . well-wishers, many of them strangers who have heard about Tripp's plight . from media reports, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution. Fighting for his life: Both sides of two-year-old Tripp Halstead's brain were injured when a large branch was blown off a tree and hit him in the head . Bubbly: Tripp was playing outside with his classmates when the branch came from nowhere and struck him down . Miracle baby: Tripp's parents Bill and Stacy said they struggled for some time before having their only son . After the accident, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news. 'His . injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It . is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the . lasting damage could be,' the message read. 'His swelling is back up and his . drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like . today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to . pray. We still need a miracle.'

A border guard in Belarus has been jailed for two years for failing to defend the ex-soviet nation from an attack by parachuting teddy bears. Belarus Supreme Court said Monday that the guard has been convicted of failure to report the intrusion of a light plane that dropped hundreds of teddy bears decked out in parachutes and slogans supporting human rights over the tightly-controlled country of 10 million. The court wouldn't give his name or rank. A border guard in Belarus has been jailed for not reporting an airdrop of teddy bears over a residential area in Minsk. The teddies, with pro democracy signs attached, were dropped by Swedish activists . Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko, dubbed 'Europe's last dictator' in the West, was furious over the July 4 incident. Two Swedish advertising agency employees flew into Belarus' heavily guarded airspace in a show of support for human rights activists in Belarus, a nation where people were arrested for clapping, including a one-armed man, in 2011. Lukashenko fired two generals, the head of the country's air force and the boss of border security. President Alexander Lukashenko is the controversial leader of Belarus. He has been in power since 1994 and wields tremendous political power . 'How do you explain the provocation with the airplane that not only crossed our borders, but entered the territory of Belarus unpunished?', he is reported to have thundered at officials. He added that any future air space violations, even those by freedom-loving cuddly toys, should be brought down with anti-air missiles. Alexander Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, has been in power since 1994. Two years after taking control he abandoned the country's parliament and hand-picked another just as it was about to impeach him. Belarus is under a raft of sanctions by the European Union over the plight of political prisoners in the country. Last year Lukashenko provoked diplomatic rebuke from Germany when he insulted the openly gay German Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, by stating that it was 'better to be a dictator than gay'. The remark was made at a summit that called for new measures to pressure Belarus over human rights abuses where Westerwelle had referred to Lukashenko as 'Europe's last dictator'. Belarus then expelled Sweden's ambassador, Stefan Erikkson, saying: 'Mr Eriksson has worked in Minsk for seven years. 'In this time his activity has been directed not at strengthening Belarussian-Swedish relations but at destroying them.' Stockholm said the situation was 'ridiculous'. Sweden has been actively pushing for democracy in Belarus. Lukashenko's re-election in December 2010, marred by fraud, led Stockholm to focus its Belarus strategy on democracy, human rights and equality. Sweden's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt reiterated Sweden's commitment to Belarusian human rights a month after the teddy bear drop. He wrote on Twitter: 'We remain strongly committed to the freedom of Belarus and all its citizens. 'They deserve the freedoms and the rights of the rest of Europe.' Belarus is a former Soviet republic which became independent with the collapse of the USSR. It still uses the rouble, its secret police is known as the KGB and the state has a powerful influence over ordinary people's lives. Human rights campaigners in the country are persecuted and often face harrassment, beatings and prison, while the media is strictly-controlled.

A young mother who tricked a Royal Marine into believing that he was the father of her baby and paying out thousands of pounds in child maintenance has failed to get her prison sentence overturned. The conned Marine treated the baby girl as his own daughter for five years before the mother's web of lies unraveled. The mother even lied about the results of a paternity test when he sought reassurance that the baby was his. She was jailed for six months at Newport Crown Court after admitting two counts of fraud last month. But yesterday she failed in a bid to be freed from jail early and allowed to return to her daughter at the Court of Appeal. Appeal: The mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, failed in her bid to get her six month jail term for fraud overturned at the Court of Appeal, pictured, yesterday . The court heard that the couple, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, had a 'brief relationship in 2006 but separated shortly before he was deployed to Afghanistan. While he was serving on the frontline, his ex-girlfriend emailed him that she was pregnant with his child. Despite his suspicions, the Marine 'accepted the child as his own' and began paying towards child support. But he asked for proof that the child was his and demanded a paternity test in 2009. The negative results were posted to the mother in Gwent, South Wales, and she lied by telling the father that the test proved the child was his. But the truth finally came to light in 2011 when the Marine ordered the results of a second paternity test to be delivered direct to him. In a victim impact statement he said that it was not the lost money which hurt him the most, but finding out that the child was not his. He described it as like a 'bereavement' and had decided not to stay in touch with the little girl because he thought it would cause her difficulties in later life. The mother said the fraud was not motivated by financial gain, but by wanting her daughter to have consistency in her life. 'We have no doubt that these offences justified the judge's conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate.' Mr Justice Eder . She told judges that she initially believed the Marine was the father. Justin Evans, defending, told Mr Justice Eder, Lord Justice Laws and Judge Michael Stokes at yesterday's appeal that prison had come as 'a crushing blow' to her. He said her daughter had lost not only the person she thought was her dad - but also her mother for the six months prison sentence. But Mr Justice Eder said the offences were too serious to justify cutting the sentence to release her. He said: 'What is absolutely clear is that, at the very latest, the mother was well aware he wasn't the father from August 2009 when she received the results of the DNA test. 'There can be little doubt about the devastating effect the mother's actions have had on him and, in our view, these are important aggravating factors. 'We have no doubt that these offences justified the judge's conclusion that an immediate custodial sentence was appropriate. 'We don't consider that the sentence imposed by the judge was wrong in principle or manifestly excessive.'","The mother was jailed for six months at Newport Crown Court last month .

An Ohio woman is one of 19 people in a single southwestern county who may have heeded the seedy advice to ‘vote early and vote often.’ Melowese Richardson, who lives in Cincinnati, told a local television station that she voted twice because she ‘certainly wanted my vote to count.’ The grandmother is one of 19 people being investigated by Hamilton County over voter fraud in the recent 2012 election. Scroll down for video . Early and often? Melowese Richardson told a local Cincinnati news station that she voted twice for Obama during the November elections . Rallying point: Mr Obama pictured at a campaign rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, two days before his election; he won 50.7 percent of the popular vote in the state . Richardson, a veteran poll worker of 25 years, told Cincinnati station WCPO-TV, that she voted twice for President Obama at the polls in November. ‘I, after registering thousands of people, certainly wanted my vote to count, so I voted,’ she said. The Hamilton County Board of Election’s director, Amy Searcy, told MailOnline that a certain amount of ‘anomalies’ pop up during every election. This year, she said, there were more than 80. ‘As we nailed down the anomalies, some required further information,’ she explained, adding that some refused to return phone calls or answer subpoenas. Ms Searcy said that she was not allowed to publically comment on the board’s on-going investigation, but said that they could make a ruling by Friday, their next board meeting. ‘The law requires us to report the facts the prosecutor’s office for further investigation and to Jon Husted, the Ohio secretary of state,’ she said. Casting ballots: Voters in Ohio put in their choices; in Hamilton County, there were around 80 anomalies, but 19 people are now under investigation for voter fraud . Richardson said that she thought she sent an absentee ballot but was afraid it would not be counted, so she went to a polling site in-person to cast her vote. The longtime poll worker said: ‘There was absolutely no intent on my part to commit any voter fraud,’ according to Fox News. Jon Husted, Ohio’s secretary of state, told the conservative news channel that Richardson ‘appears to have used her position as a poll worker to cover her tracks.’ Mr Hustead told Fox News that he was especially troubled ‘because it is my responsibility to make sure the system runs effectively, that it has integrity.’ American right: Voters cast their ballots at the Franklin County in-person absentee voting location in Columbus, Ohio this year . The secretary of state had controversially attempted to restrict early voting on the last three days before the November 6 election. He was rebuffed by a Supreme Court ruling, though his attempted restriction caused plenty of confusion at the polls. Mr Obama won the popular vote in the Buckeye State with 2,827,621 votes to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2,661,407, winning 50.7 percent of the popular vote, and 332 Electoral College votes to Mr Romney’s 206.

John McNeil had been home in Wilson for less than two days after his release from a Georgia prison when he set about the sad task of burying his wife. In death, as in the last years of her life, Anita McNeil had waited for her husband of 22 years, her high school sweetheart, the father of their two sons. Her family and friends believe she tried to wait until he was free, but she died of cancer on February 2, ten days before his release. She was buried 12 days later, on Valentine's Day, with her husband at her graveside. Free: John McNeil (centre) walks out of prison for the first time after his conviction for the murder of a builder at his home in 2005 was reduced to manslaughter following a review of the case . Rebuilding his life: McNeil, 46, pleaded guilty last week to the lesser charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to time served and 13 years of probation . In their last phone conversation, he . told her how much he loved her, and they discussed his plan to plead . guilty to manslaughter so he could get home to her before she died. 'I . told her how much she meant to me and that I needed her because I feed . off her strength and energy,' McNeil said in an interview last week. McNeil, . 46, had claimed self-defense in a fatal shooting at his home in Georgia . in 2005 but was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. He pleaded guilty last week to the lesser charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to time served and 13 years of probation. Advocates . say Georgia's 'stand your ground' law - which allows people to use . deadly force if their lives are in danger - should have blocked charges . against McNeil. As her husband fought his conviction, Anita McNeil was fighting breast cancer that spread to her bones. Tragic ending: McNeil with his wife of 22 years, Anita, who died of cancer just ten days before he was released after she had desperately tried to fight off the disease long enough to see him freed . Bid for freedom: McNeil appears in court to plead guilty to manslaughter, which he had discussed doing with his wife so he could get home to her before she died . They had last seen each other in . September and had last spoken several weeks before she died. Although he . knew his wife was sick, McNeil said he had no idea that would be their . last conversation. While in . prison, McNeil missed the funeral of his mother, who died in July 2012. He didn't want to be absent for his wife's funeral as well. And she supported the decision to plead guilty - do what you have to get home, his wife said, because we need you here. After she died, McNeil stuck by the plea because his wife had asked him to do so, regardless of what happened to her. 'I . needed to get here for our two sons,' he said. 'That was one of the . requests she made - get home to our sons, they need you.' Their . sons, John II and La'Ron, are now grown men, 28 and 26 years old. McNeil, calm and soft-spoken through most of interview, became emotional . talking about them. Victim: McNeil was convicted of shooting Brian Epp (pictured), who had built what Anita McNeil described as their dream home . Confrontation: McNeil's son had called his father after seeing Epp (pictured here with his son) in the backyard . A lot to take in: Epp's son, Taylor Epp, reflects on the decision to release his father's killer . 'I can't even explain or express the . feelings and emotions that went through my body' when he saw them again . early Wednesday morning, he said. 'No matter how old your sons get, you have a responsibility for them. When I saw them, I could only hug them and we cried.' McNeil's . case prompted calls from the NAACP and other groups for 'stand your . ground' laws to apply to all citizens, regardless of race. McNeil is black. The man he shot was white. The . Reverend William Barber, head of the North Carolina chapter of the . NAACP, called McNeil's release 'partial justice' and hinted that the . case isn't over, despite the guilty plea. 'This case is going to revolutionise how we view the criminal justice system,' he said. Scene: A witness testified that Epp came onto McNeil's driveway, ignored a warning shot and charged at McNeil, who then fired a fatal shot . Account: McNeil told police in Kennesaw, Georgia, that Epp was belligerent and had threatened his son with a knife just before the shooting . Growing up in Wilson, McNeil was one . of the good kids, never in trouble and a member of the 1984 Wilson Fike . High School basketball team that won the state championship. He . graduated from Elizabeth City State University and was selling . construction equipment in Georgia when he was arrested, nine months . after the shooting of Brian Epp, who had built what Anita McNeil . described as their dream home. La'Ron had called his father after seeing Epp in the backyard. McNeil . told police in Kennesaw, Georgia, that Epp was belligerent and had . threatened his son with a knife just before the shooting. A . witness testified that Epp came onto McNeil's driveway, ignored a . warning shot and charged at McNeil, who then fired a fatal shot. McNeil's appeals attorney has said the men were so close at that point that Epp's body touched McNeil's as he fell. Police first said he was defending himself, his home and La'Ron. Staunch ally: The Reverend William Barber (pictured), head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, called McNeil's release 'partial justice' and hinted that the case isn't over, despite the guilty plea . The Cobb County prosecutor eventually pursued charges and a jury convicted McNeil. The three-story dream home with its five bedrooms went into foreclosure. McNeil - who didn't deny shooting Epp - caught a whiff of hope in September. A judge ruled in favor of releasing McNeil and cited multiple errors at trial, including that the jury was not properly instructed on a person's right to use force to defend himself, his home or another person from violent attack. Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens appealed that ruling, setting back the McNeils' hopes. Olens' office said in October that the attorney general filed the appeal at the request of Cobb County District Attorney Pat Head, who said in May that the case is a reminder of the potential pitfalls of self-defense arguments. John McNeil . McNeil said the prosecutor's appeal was a huge setback for his wife. 'It kind of took something out of her,' he said. 'She's holding on, but we keep getting delayed, keep getting delayed. 'She was holding on, trying to hold on. And that's what hurts me to my heart, to know she was trying to hold on. And we couldn't make it so I could see her before she left.' Looking back, McNeil says there's nothing he could have done differently to protect himself and his son, pointing to his retreat, his begging of Epp not to come any closer and the warning shot. At his wife's burial, McNeil said he prayed for Epp's family. 'It's sad when we lose a loved one, no matter the circumstances,' he said. 'My heart goes out to their family. I pray for them as people pray for me and my family. You sit and say, Lord, I wish this nightmare had never happened. But it did. 'It's something you live with daily, and you constantly lean on God for his comfort and his guidance.' McNeil said he doesn't know what he plans to do next - perhaps open a business in the hometown that has welcomed him back or go to law school so he can help others. He's certain he'll stay in Wilson, where strangers pay for his meals when he eats out and people stop their cars on streets downtown to shake his hand. 'One of the things that Anita said before her passing was that ""I want justice served"",' McNeil said. 'That's what this journey is about. It ain't about coming out, celebrating. It's about total justice.'","John McNeil, 46, sentenced to life after shooting builder at his home in 2005 .

Julie Lindley and her prize winning bull mastiff Theo, one of the dogs that attacked the three little girls. A top breeder whose show dogs savaged three young girls was given a suspended jail sentence today. The girls, aged five to seven, were attacked by two bull mastiffs as they walked home from school with their mothers. They were ‘shaken like dolls’ and bitten all over their bodies, a court heard. All needed hospital treatment for their wounds and two required surgery. Owner Julie Lindley, 53, admitted the dogs, which had escaped from her garden, were dangerously out of control. She destroyed both dogs after the attack, Manchester Minshull Street Court heard. One, a two-year-old called Theo, had just been named a top UK bull mastiff and had come third at Crufts. Theo attacked the girls in Bolton after escaping from his pen with another dog on March 22 last year. Caroline Hamer told the court how the dogs bounded towards them as she walked home with her daughter, Nicola, seven, and her five-year-old friends Matilda Dawning and Charlotte Riggs. Alison Hayworth, prosecuting said: ‘The dogs pushed them all to the ground and Mrs Hamer quickly got up, however Nicola was still on the pavement with both dogs attacking her, biting her and shaking her like a doll. ‘Mrs Hamer got the dog off and tried to wedge herself between it and her daughter. A passer-by put the girl, who was covered in blood, in a car.’ The dogs then lunged at Matilda. Her . mother tried to lift her out of the way but one bit the girl’s leg and . it became ‘a tug of war’ as both mother and child were pulled into the . road.

Motorist Darren Westhead desperately tried to stop the attack by driving into one dog. But it got up again and began snapping once more. When police found the dogs, Theo had blood in his mouth. The three mothers told the court their daughters had been ‘terrified’ and would bear the physical and psychological scars for years, if not for life. Lindley, from Bolton, who runs breeding company Hyerdunscar Bullmastiffs, admitted being the owner of two dogs dangerously out of control. Since the incident, two cages have been put into the garden and the fence has been strengthened, the court heard. Judge Martin Allweis said he accepted that Lindley was full of remorse but the attack had been ‘serious and sustained’ against three children. He sentenced her to three months in jail, suspended for 12 months, and ordered her to pay £1,000 costs. She now faces a civil claim for compensation.","The three girls were 'shaken like dolls' by two bull mastiffs .

Tonight's grand final of the Great British Bake Off is expected to draw over four million viewers. Not bad for a genteel BBC2 show about cakes. The show has become one of BBC2’s biggest success stories with a peak of 4.6 million tuning in each week to see presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc and judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry whip up a TV storm. The show has been credited with making baking cool again, and reminding boys where the kitchen is (tonight's final is all male and judge Paul Hollywood's heartthrob status continues to soar). But Brtiain's love of baking isn't really new at all - just ask your grandmother. The trend for home baking has been in and out of vogue many times over the last century . From the launch of Good Housekeeping magazine in the 1920s to the introduction of TV chefs post-Coronation in the 1950s, the last century has seen the popularity of baking rise and fall according to social and economic trends. Today's thrifty climate means that we are enjoying home comforts as well as needing to stretch our bank accounts while in the 1930s the increasing popularity of cars and therefore picnics caused a boom in baking, and in the 1980s celebrity chef Delia Smith stirred our passions for the kitchen with her 'How to Cook' book. Factors contributing to the decline in home baking over the century include women going to work in the 1910s, rationing in the 1940s and mass produced processed food arriving in homes in the 1960s. To celebrate National Baking Week (which runs from 15th-21st October) and the Great British Bake Off final kitchen appliance company Kenwood has compiled a time line of baking trends with help from Wendy Wilson, archivist from Britain's oldest weekly women's magazine The Lady, and Dr Valerie Mars, a food historian. Dr Mars says: 'Baking trends are essentially uneven. Some people will always bake, especially in places with a long-standing tradition such as Yorkshire, but fashion also has a huge influence. In the current economic climate, an increase in baking at home by those who discover and enjoy the craft provides a logical way of economising during hard times.'

Paul and fellow judge Mary Berry have gained a cult following on the show . Good Housekeeping magazine in 1932 focused on 'meals for the business girl' The popularity of new domestic appliances in the 1950s led to a rise in the trend for home baking .

Delia Smith, celebrity chef and Norwich fan lured us back in to the kitchen in the nineties with her back to basics approach . 4 million viewers are expected to watch finalists John Waite, James Morton and Brendan Lynch battle it out for the Great British Bake Off crown tonight in front of judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry and presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc .","The Great British Bake Off final expects to draw an audience of over 4 million tonight .

Increase in car travel meant out-of-home dining experiences such as picnics became popular, with a variety of baking recipes dedicated to on-the-go food .
The Great Depression migrating to the UK meant that many households were unable to sustain their purchase of luxury baking ingredients, so alternative products such as margarine (instead of butter) became commonplace in the pantry.  Home baking with these cheaper products was encouraged as a way of stretching the pennies .
Leaflets from organisations such as the Potato Marketing Board issued recipe books, and companies like Stork, who had big advertising campaigns, promoted margarine .
Banana Cakes first appeared in cookbooks – grocers would share these recipes with customers when the fruit became over ripe to avoid wastage .
The rationing of the war era meant that homes had to make do with what little fresh produce they could source. Kitchen waste was eliminated and the likes of Dripping Cake recipes were eagerly shared between housewives .
Alternative cooking methods, such as pressure cookers, started to appear in the kitchen following the war – therefore it was no longer all about the oven as the main way to cook food, reducing the need to bake .

Baking oligopolies were producing sliced loaves such as Mother’s Pride and Sunblest, while Lyons was the major supplier of inexpensive cakes, producing Swiss Roll by the mile .
After the Coronation, more homes had acquired televisions, so TV cookery now had a wider audience. Among the earliest TV cooks was Philip Harben .
With the continued rationing of sugar until 1953, a variety of alternatives were commonly used to satisfy the nation’s sweet tooth. These included Golden Syrup, treacle, condensed milk and honey .

Local charity groups encouraged women to get involved and raise money by baking at home for bake-sales, as ‘their contribution’ to the cause .
Introduction of ‘foreign food’ such as pizza and pasta to the home meant that even more choice became available to the everyday family cook, not all of which would need to be baked .
The first campaign for real bread is launched in 1976 promoting better quality commercial baking and home baking. The emphasis focused on wholemeal bread, which was a minority taste .
The rise of the ‘middle classes’ meant that the dinner party became the  way to outdo the Jones, typified by the likes of Mike Leigh’s ‘Abigail’s Party’.  The need for special creations meant that many experimented with new and challenging recipes such as soufflé .
Another campaign for Real Bread is launched, this time by ‘The Sunday Times’ with food writer Caroline Conran, medical correspondent Oliver Gillie and journalist Michael Bateman .
The rise in popularity of the prefab kitchen meant that the kitchen essentials – such as the oven and hob – were ‘out of sight and out of mind’ for many homecooks .
By 1986, 1 in 5 households was estimated to have a microwave which was said to help reduce cooking time by 75% and gave rise to the influx of ready meals .
The consumption of cakes had dropped to a half century low at 69g per person per week in 1989 – DEFRA .
At home, popular tray bakes - cakes baked in a square pan using flour, eggs, sugar butter or margarine - were a simple answer to producing cake in a hurry .
In 1988, Edwina Curry resigned from the Conservative government over her statement that British eggs were contaminated with Salmonella. This caused a fall in sales and problems for domestic cooks .

De Gustibus has won several awards including Best Independent Baker of the Year in 1997. Enthusiasts like these bakers were producing similar products at home using organic craft milled flours .
Up until 2000, there was little indication that home baking had increased with a steady drop in the consumption of flour (206g in 1950 to 67g in 2000) and sugar (287g in 1950 to 105g in 2000) - DEFRA .
From 2001-2006 the sale of home baking products increased by 25%, bringing total sales to £429 million in 2006 - Mintel .
Luxury cupcakes started to become the ‘must munch’ baked good after Carrie Bradshaw from Sex in the City bought one from the New York Magnolia Bakery.  By 2010 cupcakes became the second most popular type of cake to bake at home - Mintel .

A new 200mph British supercar has broken cover with a scintillating £800,000 price-tag to match. The new flagship two-seater McLaren P1 will accelerate from rest to 62mph in under three seconds and is set to be one of the stars of next week’s Paris Motor Show. The super-lightweight but powerful supercar is being built at McLaren’s state of the art factory in Woking, Surrey and has the ambition of being the best road and track car in the world for drivers. It is about the same size as a Porsche 911 but is being seen as the spiritual successor of the legendary three-seater Mclaren F1 supercar of the 1990s – one of which ‘Mr Bean’ star Rowan Atkinson famously pranged. State-of-the-art: The super-lightweight but powerful supercar (pictured) is being built at McLaren's factory in Woking, Surrey . 'One simple goal': Manufacturers have described the vehicle as the best  driver's car on the road . A McLaren spokesman said: ‘McLaren Automotive will use its first ever international motor show appearance to preview its next generation ultimate supercar – the McLaren P1 – which takes much of its technological and spiritual inspiration from the company’s Racing division. ‘The McLaren P1 has one simple goal: to be the best driver’s car in the world on road and track.’ A prototype of the P1 car is to go on show in Paris next Thursday  with a production version to follow and go on sale in September next year. Weight is kept down thanks to its super-strong but very light carbon-fibre structure. McLaren Automotive executive chairman Ron Dennis said:‘The McLaren P1 will be the result of 50 years of racing and road car heritage . ‘Twenty years ago we raised the supercar performance bar with the McLaren F1 and our goal with the McLaren P1 is to redefine it once again.’ Hot wheels: The P1 is seen as the spiritual successor of the legendary three-seater Mclaren F1 supercar of the 1990s (pictured) Counting the cost: This was what was left of Rowan Atkinson's £640,000 McLaren F1 sports car after a prang in 2011 . McLaren automotive managing director Antony Sheriff said; ‘Our aim is not necessarily to be the fastest in absolute top speed but to be the quickest and most rewarding series production road car on a circuit.’ He added:’It is the true test of a supercar’s all round ability and a much more important technical statement. Our goal is to make the McLaren P1 the most exciting, most capable, most technologically advanced and most dynamically accomplished supercar ever made.’ When the flagship McLaren P1 goes into production later next year, it will sit above the existing 12C and 12C Spider, in terms of both price and performance with a price of around £800,000. Rowan Atkinson during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit. The comedian crashed his supercar last year . Johnny English star Rowan Atkinson spoke in September last year about the £1million crash that wrecked his own original McLaren F1 supercar noting: ’I can’t blame the car’, he confessed ruefully. ‘It was wet.‘ . And so high was the expected repair bill he added: ’I haven’t had the estimate. But I have had the estimate for the estimate.’ His Woking-built supercar is capable of 230mph, and accelerates from 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds. He was hurt when he crashed the three-seater McLaren F1 supercar into a tree in Cambridgeshire in early August 2011. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star suffered a shoulder injury and wounded pride in the accident, near Peterborough. He walked from the car, which caught fire, after the crash on the A605 at Haddon and waited for an ambulance. Atkinson, 56, was admitted to Peterborough City Hospital but later discharged with ‘a minor shoulder injury’ following the crash. Only a few weeks earlier,  he had staunchly defended the McLaren to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson: ’You've got to live with it. I have lived with it for 14 years, I've done a lot of miles in it, I've done 37,000 miles – which for a McLaren is a lot.’. He even  loaned the car to the programme on a previous occasion, when it was driven by another Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond without incident. In 1999, Atkinson damaged the bonnet of the car in a low speed shut. In 1995 former BMW boss  Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder, himself wrote-off a McLaren F1 in 1995 when he was head of the German car giant. That he and his passengers survived was put down to the strength of the car’s carbon-fibre space-frame.","Lightweight but powerful vehicle being built at McLaren's state-of-the-art factory .

Five female teachers in Pakistan  have been slaughtered by Islamic militants bent on keeping women and girls away from education. They were murdered in a New Year's Day ambush on the van carrying them home from their jobs at a community centre and primary school in the north-west of the country. The teachers and two health workers - one man and one woman - were killed this afternoon in the conservative Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Doctors treat the injured driver who survived a shooting by Islamic fundamentalists who murdered five female teachers . It was in this region that a Taliban gunman shot 15-year-old Malala Yousufzai in the head last . October for criticizing the militants and promoting girls' education. She is currently recovering in Britain. The attack was a reminder of the risks faced by educators and aid workers, especially women, in an area where Islamic militants often target women and girls trying to get an education. Many militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province oppose female education and have blown up schools and killed female educators as a way to discourage girls from getting an education. Lucky: The driver is dragged from the scene covered in blood but seven were slaughtered in the van he was driving . Attack: Today's tragedy came in the same region of Pakistan where Malala Yousufzai, who is recovering in Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, was shot just because she went to school . The workers were on their way home from a community centre in the town of Swabi where they were working at a primary school and adjoining medical center.

A father who snatched his daughter and took her to Pakistan before being jailed for refusing to say where she was is set to make a fresh bid for freedom. Razwan Ali Anjum is expected to appeal his prison sentence at the High Court - just days after Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson was finally brought back to Britain three years after her abduction. Atiya's mother, Gemma Wilkinson, is said to be 'terrified' about her former partner's potential early release. Scroll down for video . Happier times: Gemma Wilkinson with former partner Razwan Anjum, who is now in prison after abducting their daughter Atiya and is set to ask Appeal judges to release him from jail early . Return: Atiya, now six, was brought back to her mother this Christmas - three years after she was taken . Razwan, 28, a former insurance salesman, has been behind bars at Forest Bank prison in Salford since 2009. He was repeatedly jailed for contempt of court for refusing to reveal - and sometimes lying about - his daughter's whereabouts. But it is understood he is now set to lodge a fresh appeal for freedom - and could even claim he helped to find his daughter. Gemma, who has gone into hiding, fears he could try to snatch Atiya again if he is freed. A source close to the family said: . 'She's absolutely terrified of him, that he will do something else when . he gets out. He's a manipulative, cold-hearted charlatan. He knew from . day one where Atiya was but refused to say.' New heartache: Just days after being reunited with daughter Atiya, six, Gemma Wilkinson fears what will happen if her former partner's appeal is successful . Emotional rollercoaster: Gemma Wilkinson broke down on television as she awaited the return of Atiya . The child, now six, disappeared from her home in Ashton-under-Lyne in November 2009. She had gone to stay with her father on her third birthday - but never came back. Razwan said he was taking her to Southport. Instead, he took her to his native Pakistan - and then came back alone to tell Gemma she was never going to see her daughter again. Tragic: Atiya Anjum-Wilkinson has spent three years in Pakistan after she was abducted by her father - former insurance salesman Razwan Ali Anjum . Atiya and Gemma were finally reunited at Manchester Airport on Friday after the little girl was discovered in a village in the Punjab region on Christmas Eve. Gemma, 32, was found in a village near Sialkot after the latest in a string of public appeals to trace Atiya. The appeal pricked the conscience of one of her uncles, who defied other family members and revealed to the Pakistan authorities the area where she was living. The village and house were located and Atiya was taken back and put on a flight to Manchester. There she enjoyed a tearful re-union with her mum. Gemma's lawyers are expecting Razwan to take his appeal to the High Court in London after January 14, where he will urge a judge to free him immediately as his daughter has now been located. He is due to be released in April. Lawyers believe he will argue he should be freed early as his family alerted the authorities in Pakistan about the area in which Atiya was being kept. Razwan has made numerous previous appeals to be released - arguing he has helped the authorities where possible - but all have been dismissed. Even if a judge rules the stated grounds for his early release are bogus, Gemma fears he could still be released as he has served so long behind bars. Her lawyer Matthew Lord, of Pluck Andrew solicitors in Hyde, said: 'He's done absolutely nothing to assist in the recovery of his daughter and, so far as I'm concerned, he's done nothing to right the contempt of court he's been in prison for over the last three years.' Mr Lord also dismissed suggestions Razwan's family would mount a custody battle for Atiya. He said: . 'No applications or indications have been received that they are planning to issue court proceedings. But if they did plan to seek custody then it would only demonstrate their lack of understanding of the damage that has been caused to Atiya and other members of her close family by their actions so far.' Gemma Wilkinson is also said to be preparing a custody challenge to return her to Pakistan. But even as she spoke yesterday of the magical moment she gave Atiya a ‘massive cuddle’, the family of her girl’s father, Razwan Ali Anjum, 28, were preparing to get her back. A source close to the case told The Mail on Sunday: ‘The Anjum family are determined to have Atiya back, despite her father’s imprisonment. They believe they have a case and are determined to press ahead. It could all get very messy. Furore: Gemma Wilkinson is in a secret location while spending time with her daughter . ‘They were furious at being prevented from seeing her at the airport before she left Pakistan when police whisked Atiya through a VIP exit.’ Anjum was jailed for refusing to . reveal Atiya’s whereabouts, with one judge saying it was the ‘most . cruel’ form of abduction he had dealt with. It . is understood Atiya was traced on Christmas Eve to the village of . Daska, near Sialkot in the Punjab region, where she was living with . Anjum’s relatives. Anjum’s younger brother, Imran, flew to Pakistan the same day  and escorted the youngster on the flight home. Describing the moment they were . reunited, Ms Wilkinson said: ‘She looked at me and put her arms up and I . just grabbed hold of her and gave her a massive cuddle.’ Police . have been examining the circumstances of Atiya’s abduction and are . ‘considering how to take the  matter further’ now that she is home. Ms . Wilkinson, from Manchester, had a ‘few fears’ Atiya would be unsettled . after her ordeal, but said: ‘She is absolutely fine. She has a big . smile, she’s happy, she’s talking.

A Jordanian doctor who murdered his wife has been freed from jail and deported just weeks after the Parole Board warned he was still a danger, the devastated family of his victim have revealed. Hassan Shatanawi has never revealed how he killed trainee travel agent Laura May Al-Shatanawi 20 years ago, and her family still do not know what he did with her body. They fear the 67-year-old, who has shown no remorse, could be anywhere as he is no longer monitored by the UK authorities and may even sneak back into the country. Freed: Doctor Hassan Shatanawi, pictured in 1994 after being convicted of the murder of his wife, Laura May, is out of jail and deported just weeks after the Parole Board warned he was still a danger . They only found about about the killer's release after it happened, and are furious with Home Secretary Theresa May. She used newly-introduced powers which mean foreign prisoners who have served the minimum part of their sentence may be deported immediately if they have no right to remain in the country, even if the Parole Board did not recommend their release. Crime: Laura May Al-Shatanawi's body has never been found and her husband has never shown remorse for what he did . Don Vaughan, Laura May's brother, said: 'We believed from what the Parole Board said that he would remain in prison because he was still a dangerous man. 'Then we hear a couple of months later that he was on a plane and out of the country. 'We thought it was absolutely disgusting. 'Even when he was released, the authorities decided that they would only notify the family the day after, when nothing could be done.' Mr Vaughan, 53, from Hartlepool, said Shatanawi should not have been released before he revealed what he did with the 36-year-old's body. 'They could have said 'you're not going to leave these four walls unless you tell us where the body is and why you did what you did'. 'I wanted to see that man leave the country - they didn't give me that privilege. 'Now they don't know where he is. He could be back in the UK by now, because he is not tagged. He could simply change his name and sneak back in - people do it all the time.' Mr Vaughan said Cleveland Police officers, which cracked the complex case using DNA evidence which was pioneering at the time, were shocked by the killer's sudden release. 'They told us ""This doesn't happen, files have to be written, updates have to be done, before someone is let out'."" Mr Vaughan, who cares for his elderly father, said the pain of losing his sister in such a brutal way has not gone. 'Twenty years down the line, you still feel like it was yesterday. 'Until we lay my sister's body in a proper place we will never give up. 'He has never shown any remorse whatsoever. 'He has never offered an explanation. All he has proved to be is one big liar.' Blame: Laura May Al-Shatanawi's family have blamed Theresa May's deportion policy, which they fear means he will sneak back into Britain under a new name . Shatanawi tried to keep detectives at bay after he reported his wife was missing. But he was caught after they discovered an allotment shed he had bought and then tried to destroy just days later. Forensic tests discovered Laura May's blood on the partly gauged away floor of the shed. The love-cheat was believed to have dismembered her in the shed at his allotment in Seaton Carew. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 16 years in 1994 at Newcastle Crown Court. He made three unsuccessful applications for parole. Shatanawi, who owned properties in Hartlepool, had paid a workman to dismantle the shed and burn it, but the man sold it to a friend when he saw it was almost new. The couple had a seven-year-old son at the time of her murder.","Hassan Shatanawi murdered Laura May Al-Shatanawi and then dismembered her in a shed at his allotment .

They had been attempting to perform an internet craze known as the 'Cinnamon Challenge', which involves trying  to swallow one tablespoon of ground cinnamon without water. 'One girl had seen videos on the Internet and wanted to try it with her friends,' Dr Hantsch said. 'The dry, loose cinnamon triggers a violent coughing effect and also a burning sensation that actually can lead to breathing and choking hazards.' In 2011, poison centres received 51 calls about teen exposure to cinnamon. In just the first three months of 2012, they had received 139 calls. The American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that of those, 122 were classified as intentional misuse or abuse and 30 callers required medical evaluation. 'The envelope is always being pushed to create something new that will get attention, potentially create a drug-like effect and can pass under the radar of law enforcers,' Dr Hantsch said. Parents have been warned to keep an eye on their kitchen cupboards as children try out dangerous games they find online . She added that she was concerned what was once horseplay by older teenagers is now being copied by younger children. 'They have easy access to ingredients like cinnamon and marshmallows and think it is cool to do what their older peers are doing,' Dr Hantsch said. Another 'game' involving marshmallows continues to attract followers. 'Two children have actually choked to death attempting this game, so it is not to be taken lightly,' Dr Hantsch said. Ground nutmeg has been snorted, smoked and eaten in large quantities in an attempt to produce a drug-like high. Other common household products that are also being abused are hand sanitiser, ink markers and glue. Dr Hantsch said: 'Seemingly silly games can have sinister effects and the holidays are the worst time for this to happen. 'Kids have more free time, greater access to the Internet and more opportunities to get together during vacations. And at Christmas, the kitchen pantry is loaded for holiday baking. 'Adults are wise to keep an eye on their children to make sure they are using the ingredients for their proper use.'","Children as young as nine experimenting with kitchen cupboard essentials such as cinnamon and nutmeg to try and create 'drug-like effects'

Waiting for the plane on the Luton runway were a fire engine and two support vehicles, and trains to and from the airport were temporarily suspended at around 2pm as a result. The landing was made more difficult as the plane was being battered by strong winds and heavy rain, causing severe turbulence. An EasyJet spokeswoman told MailOnline the captain 'took the decision to divert as a precaution only' and that 'all passengers were given some refreshments prior to boarding another flight to Edinburgh about an hour and half later.'

Air passengers caught entering Britain with cannabis in their luggage are being let off with just a ‘slap on the wrist’. Customs staff were found to have handed out nothing more than a warning to passengers arriving at Britain’s second biggest airport. Home Office officials insist that anyone caught with the illegal Class B drug in their luggage should be arrested on the spot. They can face a jail term of up to 14 years. But inspectors found that at Gatwick, where small amounts of cannabis were discovered, passengers were not even detained by officials. No punishment: Critics fear Britain is now an 'open door' for drug smugglers . Instead they were given an oral warning, had the drug confiscated and then were allowed to continue their journey. The revelations have prompted fears that cannabis laws are being widely ignored across Britain’s airports, leading to a virtual ‘open door’ situation for drug smugglers who know they have every chance of escaping any punishment even if caught. Details of the practice at Gatwick emerged in a report by the chief inspector of the UK Border Agency, John Vine. Airport records for April and May 2011 showed that a total of four passengers were found with small quantities of cannabis after luggage searches at Gatwick North Terminal. Four passengers caught smuggling cannabis were let off with a slap on the wrist in April and May 2011 . Under . the rules, they should have been arrested and their case passed to an . investigation team. But instead, inspectors said, all four ‘were allowed . to proceed with a warning’. Inspectors . are allowed to let low-level drugs offenders pay a fine known as a . compound settlement, but this must be done with the approval of a senior . officer. In none of the four cases was the passenger even given a . financial penalty. The passengers’ personal details were recorded on an internal UK Border Agency computer system, but were not passed to the police or placed on the Police National Computer. In effect, they have nothing against their name unless they commit the same crime again. One former Customs officer said: ‘The police are now giving out warnings for bringing in cannabis... It would not surprise me in the least if this was more widespread.’ Last night Mary Brett, of campaign group Europe Against Drugs, said: ‘This is ridiculous. It sends the message, “Bring your cannabis here to Britain and if we catch you it doesn’t matter”. ‘This is simply an extension of the police’s lax attitude on the streets towards cannabis into the airport. They do not consider it a crime and they are happy to turn a blind eye. ‘Those who are caught should be dealt with properly and arrested. ‘If the authorities did prosecute a few it would send a message that we take cannabis seriously, which we obviously do not at the moment.’ Garry Cullen, assistant chief inspector of the UK Border Agency, said that what the inspectors found was ‘worrying’ and officials were acting outside the law. ‘Clearly we were concerned with what we found,’ he said. ‘They should comply with the rules that are set out and they did not.' Under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act the maximum penalty for bringing a class B drug such as cannabis into Britain is 14 years in jail and an unlimited fine. But in practice, penalties for cannabis possession on Britain’s streets have been steadily eroded in recent years. The drug was downgraded to Class C by the then Home Secretary, Labour’s David Blunkett, in 2004. Decriminalised: Cannabis was downgraded to Class C by the then Home Secretary, Labour's David Blunkett, in 2004 . Since then, users have no longer faced automatic arrest. Instead, police give a formal warning for cannabis possession on the street. Even after it was restored to Class B in 2008 police were allowed to give out cannabis warnings, which were handed to nearly 19,000 offenders in 2010 and do not go on offenders’ formal record. Experts warned that ignoring penalties would encourage more people to bring in drugs. Criminologist Dr David Green, director of the Civitas think tank, said: ‘If you allow it to be known that the law is not enforced, people will break it more frequently. ‘Word will spread that you can get cannabis in at Gatwick and more people will try to bring it in.’ The report said staff had been moved away from Customs checks to staff immigration controls. Lucy Moreton, deputy general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said: ‘I can’t say I’m surprised. Like everything, the customs side of the operation is limited and there’s a lot of pressure to put people on to immigration checks. ‘Given the pressure on staff I can understand if the view was to confiscate the drugs and let the individual go.’ A Border Force spokesman said: ‘Our message is clear: Importing cannabis is illegal and our officers will seize it and other illegal drugs if smugglers try to bring it into the UK. ‘In recent weeks we have seized 100 kilos [220lb] of cannabis alone, and we are continuing to tackle the drug trade and prosecute smugglers.’","Passengers caught with small amount of drug are escaping with a warning .

Someone earning the new London rate . would make almost £5,000 a year more than someone working 40 hours a . week on the National Minimum Wage of £6.19 an hour. Mr Johnson, whose Greater London .

Pegg was considered a mentor to the Boy Scouts he trained, but now it is thought that Pegg sexually abused his murdered at a young age . A former scoutmaster who had deep local ties to his New Jersey community was brutally murdered over the summer and was found with his throat slit and multiple stab wounds over his body. Dennis J. Pegg was considered a mentor to the Boy Scouts he trained, but months after his grisly murder, darker questions have arisen. Clark Fredericks, the 46-year-old man who confessed to Pegg’s murder, said that the scoutmaster sexually abused him as a boy, and said that he ‘got what was coming to him.’ Now, months after Pegg’s gruesome murder, others have echoed Fredricks’ complaint of sexual abuse. Pegg was a lifelong resident of Stillwater, New Jersey, and had been active not only in the Boy Scouts, but many police honor legions, the NRA, and historical societies. He had also served in the military during the Vietnam Era. But while his obituary painted the 68-year-old as an upstanding citizen, Fredericks’ affidavit showed Pegg in a drastically different light. Fredericks said in his affidavit that Peggs ‘got what was coming to him’ because he had been ‘a child molester for years,’ and had exploited his time as a scoutmaster in the 1970s to get closer to young boys. The court records, obtained by the New Jersey Star-Ledger, allege that Fredericks went to Pegg’s home in Stillwater on the night of June 12, joined by his friend, Robert Reynolds. The two men were carrying knives in their vehicle. According to the affidavit, the two began stabbing Pegg as soon as they arrived at his quiet rental home. Boys turned to men: Court records allege that Clark Fredericks (left) went to Pegg’s home in Stillwater on the night of June 12, joined by his friend, Robert Reynolds (right) Chilling photographs from Pegg’s entryway show large blood spatters where he was allegedly knifed. Pegg was later found on his living room floor with more than 20 stab wounds to his torso. His throat was also slit. Fredericks then drove to his mother’s house in Stillwater and removed his bloodied clothes, hiding the murder weapons in the process, the affidavit stated. His mother, Joan Fredericks, tried in vain to get her son to seek medical attention for wounds he had apparently received from the assault, but Fredericks merely took some sleep medication and went to bed, the document said. He was charged with first-degree murder. Reynolds, 47, was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being an accomplice. Both men have pleaded not guilty to the alleged crimes. Shaming the badge: Prior to his death, Pegg had been involved with the Stillwater, New Jersey Boy Scouts, as well as a number of other community organizations and historical societies . Scene: Pegg was later found on his living room floor with more than 20 stab wounds to his torso. His throat was also slit . According to the Los Angeles Times, a source told police that they had seen a box containing pictures of child pornography at Pegg’s house in the 1970s. Authorities retrieved a box of pictures of young boys from Pegg’s house, though none were considered to be pornographic.  Pegg was never married and had no children. ‘The witness described seeing this box . roughly 35 years ago, so it’s not overly surprising we were unable to . find it,’ Sussex County Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Mueller told the . paper. There were no files of abuse on Pegg, a Boy Scout spokesperson said. Pegg’s . estate is being overseen by his friend and attorney Ernest Hemschott . III, who told the Times: ‘I’d have put my life in his hands. I trusted . him that much.’ Mr Hemschott continued: ‘If it did happen, my heart goes out to the victims. But I just find it hard to believe.’ The . prosecuting attorney over the case speculated in June that the alleged . attack was carried out only a day after former Penn State assistant . football coach Jerry Sandusky went on trial. News . of Pegg’s murder and of Fredericks’ abuse allegations come as the Boy . Scouts face close scrutiny for their handling of past molestation . claims. The files, kept at . Boy Scout headquarters in Texas, consist of memos from local and . national Scout executives, handwritten letters from victims and their . parents and newspaper clippings about legal cases. The documents contain details about proven molesters, but also unsubstantiated allegations. The allegations stretch across the country and to military bases overseas, from a small town in the Adirondacks to downtown Los Angeles. In some cases, local law enforcement did nothing - despite a confession - seeking to protect the name of Scouting over their victims. Boxed files containing witness accounts, complaints, and unresolved allegations of sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts were released in October. They contain cases collected between 1959 and 1985, with a handful of others from later years. The files also document other troubling patterns. There is little mention in the files of concern for the welfare of Scouts who were abused by their leaders, or what was done for the victims. But there are numerous documents showing compassion for alleged abusers, who were often times sent to psychiatrists or pastors to get help. In numerous instances, alleged abusers are kicked out of Scouting but show up in jobs where they are once again in authority positions dealing with youths. The files also show Scouting volunteers serving in the military overseas, molesting American children living abroad and sometimes continuing to molest after returning to the states. But one of the most startling revelations to come from the files is the frequency with which attempts to protect Scouts from molesters collapsed at the local level, at times in collusion with community leaders.

Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius today insisted he had no intention of killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp as he gave a graphic account of the night he shot her dead, claiming he mistook her for a burglar when he woke up in the middle of the night. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel  claimed Pistorius got up from bed, put on his prosthetic legs and walked seven metres before shooting Ms Steenkamp through a closed bathroom door. Mr Nell said it showed it was a premeditated murder, adding there was 'a motive to kill'. But in a statement Pistorius said he woke up to a sound in the bathroom believing it was an intruder and he felt vulnerable without his prosthetics.

French fashion house Thierry Mugler has become the latest high-profile sponsor to distance itself from Oscar Pistorius as the Paralympian fights murder charges in South Africa. The company has announced the immediate and complete withdrawal of all products featuring Pistorius including its 'A*men Pure Shot' fragrance, which was launched as a special edition to mark last year's London Paralympics. In addition, Thierry Mugler has removed all point-of-sale advertising featuring Pistorius, and deleted all references to the athlete from its website. A Thierry Mugler spokesperson said: 'Out of respect and sympathy to the families involved in this tragic case, Thierry Mugler Parfums has removed all campaigns featuring Oscar Pistorius.' Promotional material for 'A*Men Pure Shot' last year described it as 'a bold fragrance.. embodied by the charismatic Oscar Pistorius, chosen for his unique journey and values of excellence and achievement that he symbolises and represents.' Two other major sponsors, Oakley and Nike, also distanced themselves from the athlete this week following his charge over the shooting death of his girlfriend. Oakley has suspended its contract with Pistorius while Nike said it has no plans to use him in future campaigns. British Telecom, with whom Pistorius has been involved as a brand ambassador as well as an ambassador for the BT Paralympic World Cup, issued a short statement today saying: 'Given the ongoing situation we have nothing further to say at this time.' The couple went to sleep shortly after 10pm, Pistorius said, but in the middle of the night he woke up and thought an intruder had climbed in through his bathroom window. He said he grabbed a 9mm pistol - which he kept under his bed after receiving death threats - and made his way in the darkness towards the bathroom door. 'As I didn't have my prosthetic legs on I was vulnerable,' he said. 'I fired a shot at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to call the police.' The defendant described how he was 'absolutely mortified at the death of my beloved Reeva'. Pistorius began shaking and crying as his statement was read out, according to the South African Press Association. The bail hearing came as Steenkamp's funeral was held in her home town of Port Elizabeth. Magistrate Desmond Nair ruled that the case was a schedule six offence - meaning premeditated murder - for the purpose of the bail hearing in Pretoria. Prosecutor Mr Nel told the court the victim arrived at the house between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday, and went to the bathroom after an argument between the pair. He said that at 3am Pistorius got up from his bed, walked to the bathroom door and fired four shots through the closed door, hitting her three times. 'She couldn't go anywhere. You can run nowhere,' Mr Nel said. He told the court Pistorius later told a friend he thought she was a burglar. Mr Nel said: 'It was all part of the pre-planning. Why would a burglar lock himself inside the bathroom?' Pistorius' lawyer, Barry Roux, said Steenkamp was not murdered and there were a number of cases where men shot members of their own family through doors after mistaking them for burglars. Shocking: Oscar Pistorius was charged with murdering his girlfriend on Valentine's Day at his Pretoria home .

Pistorius was tested on August 25 last year, just four days before the Paralympic Games began, and again on September 8 following his victory in the T44 400 metres. Both tests came back negative. An International Paralympic Committee (IPC) source added: 'Pistorius was a very heavily tested athlete. In addition to tests at IPC events he would also have been tested at IAAF events, as well as by South Africa's own anti-doping agency.' Laura Williamson . He also suggested that Pistorius broke down the bathroom door after the shooting to help Steenkamp. 'We submit it is not even murder,' Mr Roux said. 'There is no concession this is a murder.' Pistorius won two gold medals and a silver at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. He also competed in the Olympics. Steenkamp was cremated at a memorial service attended by family and . friends who had travelled from around the world.

A man who inhumanely slaughtered a pig in his front yard before butchering it has been convicted of animal cruelty charges. A shocked RSPCA officer found former boxer Ricky Clarkson, 48, cutting up the animal on a table in the front yard of his house in May this year after being called to the property by a neighbour. He initially said he had killed the pig by hammering a nail through its head before later changing his story and telling a court he had slit its throat. Butchered: After catching Ricky Clarkson butchering the pig in his front yard, RSPCA officers found parcels of pork chops in his freezer when they returned with a warrant to search his property . When RSPCA officers returned 10 days later with a search warrant, they found . parcels of pig meat stored in a freezer, the remnants of a carcass in a . recycling bin and several knives in a shed. Mr Clarkson, of Bradmore Way, Coulsdon, south London, then denied having killed the pig with a nail and said he had 'slit its throat, Halal-style', Bromley Magistrates Court heard. He said he was unaware of laws stipulating that pigs should be shot with a stun gun prior to being killed. Andrew Wiles, prosecuting, said: 'You are allowed to home-slaughter if you follow the regulations. You did not do that. You are coming up with your story today now you know what those regulations are.' Cruelty: Officers found several knives in Mr Clarkson's shed when they returned to search the property . Mr Clarkson, defending himself, said he had used a captive bolt gun to stun the pig before killing it but had lied to officers because he feared prosecution for possessing the gun. He said: 'I kill animals law-abidingly and honestly.' He said he planned to eat the pig and had also shot kangaroos in the past. Saved from the chop: The RSCPA rescued this pig from Mr Clarkson's house after he was banned from keeping animals for a year . He denied causing unnecessary suffering to an animal by killing it in an inhumane manner, failing to prevent suffering to an animal that was his responsibility and killing a pig without prior stunning. But magistrates found him guilty of all three charges and banned him from owning pigs, sheep or chickens for a year. He was also fined £150 and ordered to pay £1,000 costs.","Ricky Clarkson slaughtered the animal at his home in south London .

After just one viewing Louise Cotton has shelled out £120,000 on the ultimate seaside home - a coastal property covered inside and out with millions of shells. Louise, 48, grew up near the unique property - which is plastered with shells from creatures including clams, cockles and scallops. The-two-bedroom cottage has hoards of crustacean cases stuck to walls and ceilings - many of them made into shapes such as boats and anchors. Freelance radio journalist Louise Cotton pictured inside her Dartmouth home which is covered in shells . Shelling out: Louise spent £120,000 on the landmark property on Lake Street in Dartmouth, Devon . Louise was fascinated with the house when she was a child and immediately snapped it up when it recently hit the market. The three-storey property in Dartmouth, Devon, was plastered with shells by previous owners Paul and Joyce Plimmer three decades ago. Louise said: 'It only took one viewing and I decided right then and there to buy it. 'I wouldn't say it was absolutely my taste but it's unusual, it has loads of personality and I think it's great to see something that's different and eccentric. 'I wouldn't have the imagination to do something like that and I admire the people who do. There are boats, lighthouses, anchors and all sorts of nautical images. Previous owners plastered the house on Lake Street, Dartmouth, with assorted shells three decades ago . The well-known house in Lake Street features on postcards and websites advertising Dartmouth . The decoration has been created using shells of crustaceans such as clams, cockles and scallops . 'Lots of people have asked me if I'm going to get rid of the shells, their assumption is that they're awful - but I don't agree. 'I come from Dartmouth and I think it's a bit of our local history. It would be a real shame if Dartmouth lost some of that quirkiness.' Louise's new abode in Lake Street has been a local landmark for years and even features on postcards and websites. Jackson Plimmer collected shells to decorate the house throughout his childhood. He estimates there are 'millions' fixed to the Devon property . Louise said the shell mosaics on the house's facade are 'unusual' and 'eccentric' A few of the shells already need to be replaced after one became dislodged from a stairwell - and hit Louise in the head. Louise, a freelance radio journalist, remembers visiting the shell house as a child when it was owned Mr and Mrs Plimmer. Their son Jason, 51 explained: 'It was just an old fisherman's cottage back when I was born until dad went to an auction one day to buy furniture. Shells have been embedded into the outside walls of the house and the bathroom was once a 'mermaid grotto' Louise says her new shell-clad home is part of local history in the seaside town of Dartmouth . 'He came back with an antique shell collection and that gave him the idea of covering the house instead of decorating it. 'He put up scaffolding outside and did the front while my mum did the inside. The bathroom used to be a mermaid's grotto. 'My brothers and I were in charge of collecting the shells. We would come back with giant sacks full - there must be literally millions in that house.'

The bloody sock worn by ex-Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling during the 2004 World Series could fetch up to $600,000 at auction. The sock will go up for live auction on Friday in New York by Texas-based Heritage Auctions. A spokesman for the auction house predicts the bloody garment will fetch some significant cash. Blood money: Curt Schilling's bloody sock, shown here during the 2004 World Series, is expected to fetch as much as $600,000 . 'This is obviously the first time we've ever offered a sock at auction,' Chris Ivy, Director of Sports Auctions for Heritage, told CNBC. 'But it relates to a very significant moment in the World Series.' Schilling was wearing the sock when he pitched the baseball championship game on October 24, 2004 with a damaged tendon, which led to the bleeding. Though he could barely walk, he pitched six innings, only allowing a single run. That Game 2 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals paved the way for the Red Sox to secure their first championship in 86 years, ending the 'Curse of the Bambino' that has hung over the Boston team since 1918, when the Red Sox sold star slugger Babe Ruth to the Yankees. The sock previously had been on loan to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. It has been at Heritage's Dallas headquarters for several weeks and on display at the auction house's Manhattan office before it is sold. Spectacle: The bloody sock was previously on display, along with the cleats that Schilling wore during the World Series game, at the National Baseball Hall of Fame . Schilling is putting the sock up for auction given the retired MLB star has not found success in his post-baseball career. Schilling's company, 38 Studios, was . lured to Providence, Rhode Island, from Massachusetts with a $75million . loan guarantee in 2010. In May, it laid off all its employees and it filed for bankruptcy in June. The state is now likely responsible for some $100million related to the deal, including interest. Schilling also had personally guaranteed loans to the company and listed the sock as bank collateral in a September filing with the Massachusetts secretary of state's office. He has said he invested as much as $50million in 38 Studios and has lost all his baseball earnings. He told WEEI-AM in Boston last year that possibly having to sell the sock was part of 'having to pay for your mistakes.' 'I'm obligated to try and make amends and, unfortunately, this is one of the byproducts of that,' he told the station. Fall: Schilling is believed to have lost $50million that he had invested into video game company 38 Studios, which filed for bankruptcy last year . The bloody sock is one of two that sent Schilling into the annals of baseball lore in 2004. The . other was from Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, when . Schilling pitched against the New York Yankees with an injured ankle. That sock is said to have been discarded in the trash at Yankees Stadium. The hall had had the sock since 2004. Heritage . last May auctioned off the so-called 'Bill Buckner ball,' which rolled . through the legs of the Red Sox first baseman in the 1986 World Series. Ivy . said that item, like Schilling's sock, was listed at the time as being . expected to bring in '$100,000-plus,' but it was sold to an anonymous . bidder for $418,000. 'We wouldn't be surprised to see this do something in that range,' he said, estimating the sock could be sold for as much as $600,000.

Success: Smiling Lucy Johns, pictured with driving instructor Andy Roberts, has passed her driving test so that she can fulfil her dying wish of taking her son Stanley to school for the first time . A mother who is terminally ill with breast, bone and liver cancer has learned to drive so that she can fulfil her dying wish - to do the school run. Lucy Johns, 30, has to stay in hospital for weeks at a time while she undergoes draining chemotherapy, but she still found the time to pass her driving test so that she can drop son Stanley, six, at school for the first time. She passed the test first time despite being involved in an accident the day before and will drive Stanley to St Paul's Roman Catholic Primary School in Plymouth, Devon, on Monday. Lucy, of Plymouth, Devon, said: 'All of a sudden I was in hospital for four weeks at a time and Stanley couldn't understand why he was being passed around friends and relatives. 'When he started school my friend took him and he started getting upset and asking why I never went with him. 'Then I would get upset because he'd talk about his friends and teachers and I wouldn't know anything about them. 'I would wave him off at the door then have no idea exactly who was looking after him at school. As a mother that's really tough. She added: 'That was the main reason I decided to drive but also to do the simple things like driving to the park just so I can watch my kids play. 'It's easy to take these moments for granted but they have become absolutely precious for me.' Lucy and her husband Pete, 33, were told of her illness following the birth of their second child Lillie-Lou, who is now aged two. She had to wait until she had given birth to undergo tests on a mass in her chest. Scans revealed that Lucy had breast cancer and that it had spread to her bones and liver. She said: 'It was awful. 'My cancer is incurable and I am classed as terminally ill but I am having treatment so I can live and be a mum for as long as possible.' Kind-hearted local driving instructors gave Lucy 45 hours of free driving lessons after she spoke of her determination to pass her test. She was so desperate to pass as quickly as possible that she sometimes had four hour long lessons. But she was left shaken the day before her test when another motorist drove into the back of her learner car. Lucy said: 'I was so nervous for my test I did not think I would pass. I am so excited now. I wanted to get this so much. 'Sometimes I would have a lesson lasting three or four hours. That was almost too much but nothing was going to stop me.'","Lucy Johns, 30, was diagnosed with breast, bone and liver cancer .

Court: Actor Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving for six months because he ran a red light last year . James Bond villain Steven Berkoff has been banned from driving after jumping a red light, despite maintaining he was trying to get out of the way of a police car. The veteran actor, writer and director, 75, who played General Orlov in Octopussy alongside Roger Moore, said he had not meant to break the law. In a letter read out at City of London Magistrates' Court he claimed while driving his VW Beetle through Central London: 'I heard a siren in the near distance and turned to get out of its way.' But he still pleaded guilty to failing to comply with traffic signals on October 25 last year, earning himself a six-month ban from driving. Berkoff, who has been caught speeding twice in the last two years and ran another red light in March 2012, already had nine points on his licence. He was handed three more points today, leading to automatic disqualification. 'Mr Berkoff was driving a Volkswagen Beetle motor vehicle in Upper Thames Street, at the junction with Queen Street Place', said prosecutor Varinder Hayre. 'He crossed the stop line when the light had been red for 1.5 seconds, and he was at a speed of 27mph. 'The police did not offer an immediate conditional offer due to the time the lights had been red.' Berkoff, star of movies including Beverley Hill Cop and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, initially gave the court his Californian driving licence number, but checks showed he also holds a UK licence. 'Police were given a DVLA notice with nine penalty points, meaning he is liable for disqualification under the totting up procedure', said Ms Hayre. Famous: The star of stage and screen is perhaps best known for his role as Bond villain General Orlov, shown here in Octopussy . Berkoff's case was in court last month to be dealt with, but it was adjourned so he could be warned he was facing a ban. The star was offered a chance to tell magistrates why he should be spared from disqualification, but he did not show up to court. Berkoff was given six points after being caught speeding on September 18, 2010, and March 11, 2012, and another three points for driving through a red light on March 13, 2012. Magistrates also fined him £300 for the offence, and he was ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £30 victim surcharge.

"By . Joanna Blythman . PUBLISHED: . 19:25 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:41 EST, 17 January 2013 . The news that some of Britain’s favourite supermarkets have been selling horse meat has come as a shock to many shoppers. After all, the big retailers never miss an opportunity to remind us of their ‘high standards’. In their advertising campaigns, they boast of meeting the customers’ needs through their rigorous quality control, and delight in telling us which particular farmer their produce comes from. Following scandals such as the BSE ‘mad cow’ outbreak and the great salmonella scare, they also now trumpet their adherence to food safety throughout their supply lines. Food chain: Do you really know what you are eating? (File picture) Meanwhile, shoppers are assured that rigorous regulations on labelling mean we know exactly what we are buying. Dodgy meat, like the sale of contaminated eggs, was meant to be a thing of the past in the brave new shiny world of mass retailing. Yet the revelation that several of the country’s biggest names — including Tesco, Lidl, Iceland and Aldi — have been selling beef burgers that contain horse meat should come as no surprise. For the fact is that our trust in the big supermarket chains is badly misplaced. The sheer massiveness of the scale of their operations is a central part of the problem. The industrialisation of the food supply, driven by the big retailers and reflected in everything from mass factory farming to the vast distribution networks, is bound to lead to corners cut and standards compromised. Not shocked: The revelation that burgers containing horse meat were on sale at some supermarkets came as no surprise to Joanna Blythman . The big supermarkets put relentless pressure on their suppliers to give them the lowest price possible. The suppliers respond in turn by downgrading the quality of their meat and using cheaper ingredients. It’s not just supermarket customers who have had horse meat on their plates recently. But at least diners at the L’Escargot Bleu restaurant in Edinburgh knew what they were getting. Owner Fred Berkmiller has been serving horse steak for two years, usually raw. He was sorry yesterday he had none available, given the interest sparked by the contaminated supermarket burgers story. ‘Supply is not easy, because our horse meat comes from France, and we’d certainly not use just any horse. Ours are bred by farmers in the Languedoc region, from a rare breed, especially for eating.’ At the restaurant, a steak tartare de cheval is a starter costing less than £10. It’s made of minced fillet of horse, mixed with raw egg, chopped onion, chilli sauce and capers. Berkmiller says the dish is very popular, as are grilled horse steaks. But Berkmiller is unique. Though High Street butchers will supply horse steak if asked, no other British restaurant serves the meat because most Brits won’t touch it. In France, by contrast, they eat their way through 70,000 horses a year. Horse meat also remains popular in Italy — sometimes as a sausage or in a stew. In Japan, horse sashimi (served rare) is a delicacy, and much of Kazakhstan’s national cuisine is based around the flesh. It is largely the English-speaking countries of the West — Britain, Ireland and the U.S. — where eating it has become something of a taboo, mainly because these days we view horses more as pets than farm animals or livestock. Burgers are particularly vulnerable to such downgrading because they are made of processed meat, which dramatically widens the scope for adulteration compared to, say, a chicken breast or a piece of steak. Indeed, the process of mincing hides a multitude of sins. In its classic form, a burger should be nothing more than minced beef, salt and freshly ground pepper. But in the supermarket, even a premium burger has to contain only 80 per cent of the meat named in the title, usually beef or chicken. The rest can be made up of assorted additives, fat and soya protein to bulk out the mixture. When it comes to economy burgers (like those tested from the four major chains by the Irish Food Authority’s horse meat investigation), just 59 per cent of content needs to be meat. Even this 59 per cent is allowed to include the unsavoury-sounding ‘mechanically recovered meat’ (MRM), which is little more than a pink slurry produced by grinding every last remnant from the animal’s carcass under high pressure. Although if this substance is added to the cheap and uncheerful mix, it would have to be labelled. Until recently, MRM was allowed to contain even the spinal column of cows, though this was finally banned after concern that such a source could be passing on BSE to humans. Yet the quality remains poor. Among the 21 listed ingredients for one typical ‘economy’ burger are: rusk, ‘soya protein isolate’, preservative, stabilisers to hold it  together (diphosphates, triphosphates), sugar, malt extract, pepper extract and beef fat. Given such a cocktail of chemical and synthetic ingredients, it is little wonder that some suppliers felt they could get away with sneaking in a bit of horse meat. If proper controls were working, of course, they could never have done so. But the truth is that the supermarkets’ labelling and safety procedures are not nearly as rigorous as they like to pretend, particularly when it comes to meat processing. Most of this food preparation takes place in dank, noisy processing plants, carried out by a disgruntled, badly paid, often migrant workforce. The required food checks are not subject to external or spot inspections. Far from it. These checks amount to little more than a box-ticking exercise. Suppliers simply give their written assurance that they’ve shown ‘due diligence’ and complied with a series of official safety requirements, called Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points or HACCP. These have their origins in the U.S. during World War II when they were introduced to regulate the testing of munitions. Food HACCP systems are now widely used across the globe to protect public health. But to ensure proper compliance, they should be policed by either the supermarkets themselves or Government officials, such as food safety inspectors or Environmental Health officers. Slaughter house: Supermarkets put pressure on suppliers to give them the lowest price possible and in turn suppliers downgrade the quality of their meat (file picture) However, these official inspections do not happen as often as they should, partly because austerity measures have led to cutbacks in local government budgets, and partly because the supermarkets do not want the burden of extra costs. So retailers pass on the responsibility to suppliers, who have a vested interest in keeping scrutiny to a minimum. I suspect the current scandal was exposed not through rigorous inspection, but the actions of a whistleblower in one of the supply firms based in Ireland. Perhaps fed up with poor pay and hellish conditions, or sickened by unsavoury practices, they may have contacted the Irish Food Authority to complain about what their company was up to. Of course, it’s important to remember that there is no actual health risk to eating horse meat. It was consumed in Britain until the 20th century, and even today it is not illegal to sell it here. Every year, Britain sends around 10,000 horses to Europe for consumption, particularly to France, where it remains a popular part of the national diet. Good quality? Consumers have the right to know what they are eating and the big supermarkets have let us down with their casual approach to enforcement (file picture) But although eating horse meat will do us no harm, it is nevertheless fraudulent to pass it off as a classic beef burger. Consumers have the right to know what they are eating and the big supermarkets have let us down with their casual approach to enforcement. Indeed, the problem extends further than horse meat. This investigation has shown that many beef ready meals also contained traces of pig DNA. This makes their sale not merely an act of serious misrepresentation but also highly offensive to Jews and Muslims. Nor, incidentally, is horse meat strictly kosher. The supermarkets’ obsession with a price-driven, over-mechanised approach to food is profoundly misguided. Adulteration is the price we pay for over-industrialisation. This horse meat scandal shows what I and other food writers have long argued — that we would all be better relying on local butchers, suppliers and locally sourced foods. Of course, the supermarket giants exposed for selling horse meat were quick to try to reassure customers. Tesco’s technical director Tim Smith said his company would ‘not tolerate any compromise in the quality of the food we sell. Our customers have the right to expect that the food they buy is produced to the highest standards.’ But every new scandal undermines shoppers’ trust in the supermarket giants as customers learn the painful lesson that their stranglehold can so easily be a recipe for dubious products of unsavoury pedigree. ■ Joanna Blythman is author of What To Eat.","Our trust in the big supermarkets is badly misplaced, writes Joanna Blythman .

New cars sold in Britain and Europe risk catching fire and exploding in a crash because of EU rules to impose a controversial 'green' air-conditioning coolant from the start of this year, German car giant Mercedes-Benz has warned. The luxury car-maker says the new 'climate-friendly' air-con chemical is 'highly flammable', poisonous and poses a danger both to occupants and rescue services – and German government officials now agree. Mercedes-Benz is refusing to put the controversial new gas refrigerant into its latest vehicles, sparking a major confrontation with Brussels and the firms who make it  - both of whom deny any safety risks. Wheels on fire: Mercedes carried out their own tests on the coolants . Today, Mercedes-Benz and its parent company Daimler received backing from Germany's Federal Environment Agency UBA. It asked the EU to 'compromise' by granting them and other car-makers – including Volkswagen and Audi - an  extension from the mandatory rules until 2015 if they agree to  introduce an alternative green refrigerant based on carbon dioxide, which experts say is safer because it doesn't burn. If Daimler is correct, around 2 million new cars sold in the UK each year are potentially at risk. Photographs from the firm's own simulated crash tests on cars showed that a mix of the refrigerant and air-conditioning compressor oil released under a car's hood could ignite a heated engine. This would mainly be a risk if the car crashes, but it is also possible if the coolant leaks for any other reason. The row centres on the new coolant with the codename 'R1234yf' which Daimler argues can start a fire in the car and release toxic hydrogen fluoride gas. It is the replacement for the long-time industry standard, which EU legislators in Brussels have ordered to be phased out from January because of concerns about greenhouse gases. The new 'green' refrigerant is produced by US giant Honeywell and is currently the only one if its kind that meets new EU climate guidelines. The firm denies categorically that there is any safety risk. Hot rod: Mercedes say the EU regulations will lead to accidents . Car makers are supposed to phase in the change from the start of this year, but by 2017 every single one of the estimated 14 million a year air-conditioned vehicles that rolls off assembly lines for sale in Europe  will be filled with about £43 worth of  the new coolant. This will not include the million Mercedes-Benz's built each year, of which 90,000 are sold in the UK. Urging the EU to compromise, Jochen Flasbarth, president of Germany's  Federal Environment Agency UBA said: 'We have been warning about the dangers (of HF0-1234yf) for years. Daimler's internal tests proved not only that our own fears were justified but also that we may even have underestimated the risks.' But he added: 'It's just not possible to switch to a CO2-based system within six months or even a year, though, so I would propose giving carmakers until the end of 2015 to make the switch.' Mr Flasbarth noted:'If you switch to CO2 then you reduce your global warming potential by 75 per cent over HFO-1234yf, so I think that justifies permitting a longer transition time for those carmakers that commit to the switch,' Earlier this month, BMW joined Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi in resigning from an industry research group looking into the safety of HFO-1234yf, due to concerns over the scientific thoroughness of the investigation. Mercedes officials said they were horrified by the results of the coolant leak tests . Mercedes-Benz  executives said  they watched in horror when engineers at a test-track in Sindelfingen in Germany simulated a leak in the air-conditioning line of a Mercedes B-Class tourer using the new coolant. After releasing a fine mixture of the refrigerant and air-conditioning compressor oil which sprayed across the car's turbo-charged 1.6 litre engine, they watched it ignite in 'a ball of fire' before their eyes. The substance caught fire as soon as it hit the hot surface, releasing a toxic, corrosive gas as it burned. The car's windshield turned milky white as lethal hydrogen fluoride began eating its way into the glass, said the firm. Stefan Geyer, a senior Daimler engineer who ran the tests said: 'We were frozen in shock, I am not going to deny it.' A Mercedes-Benz  source said: 'In over . half the tests, a significant fire occurred, which could endanger the . lives of passengers and rescue teams. 'It doesn't explode like in the movies. But there is a boom and a ball of fire.' Mercedes source . Walter Pütz, director of vehicle certification and regulatory affairs at Mercedes-Benz Cars said: 'The whole vehicle can catch fire and the burning refrigerant generates acutely poisonous hydrogen fluoride which poses a severe danger to both passengers and rescue workers.' In sharp contrast, the existing refrigerant 'was proved to be safe under identical testing conditions, he said. Daimler said in a statement: 'Due to the new findings of this study and the high safety demands at Mercedes-Benz, this chemical will not be used in its products.' German carmaker Volkswagen has also announced it is looking at an alternative carbon-dioxide (CO2) based coolant to the new 'green' version. But MEPs said parent company Daimler were putting cost-cutting ahead of climate change remedies – charges the firm denies. Liberal MEP Chris Davies told European magazine EurActive that the firm was trying to 'frustrate' the directive's ambitions: 'Daimler are evil and I think their CEO should be summoned to the European parliament and humiliated.' He said: 'Daimler has apparently discovered that HFO-1234yf is flammable. Well so are petrol, oil and diesel. Of course it's flammable if you shove a flame thrower under it, which is more or less the test that Daimler is said to have carried out.' Honeywell today countered the safety fears by publishing a report from  safety experts SAE International saying that their new air-con fluid 'posed no greater threat than any other engine compartment fluids.' It accused Mercedes-Benz of using 'unrealistic' and 'extremely idealised' testing conditions. Honeywell  vice president Terence  Hahn said the report left no doubt that their  refrigerant 'is safe for automotive applications.' A spokesman for Britain's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said it was taking seriously Mercedes-Benz's concerns, adding: 'At the forefront of all members thoughts is the safety of drivers and passengers in the vehicles they are putting on the market. 'The additional research is welcome and members will be looking at the outcomes of that research closely.' Paul Sanders, managing director Fluorines EMEAI, Honeywell said their new air conditioning  refrigerant ‘has been proven to be a safe and effective replacement.’ ‘It is already in use by the auto industry. It reduces the global warming impact of automotive refrigerants by 99.7 per cent. ‘Its adoption in cars today would have the greenhouse gas equivalent impact of removing more than 4 million cars from European roads.’ He added car-makers  had six years to prepare to meet the requirements of the new directive and that ‘the vast majority of automakers have taken the necessary steps to comply’ He  said Germany’s Federal  Environment Agency (UBA) ‘only spreads misinformation’ and said using carbon-dioxide was ‘inefficient’  and had ‘short-comings’ adding:’It has higher emissions when both the air-conditioning system and efficiency of the engine are accounted for.’ Vauxhall, part of the giant General Motors, said it was pressing ahead with plans to introduce the new coolant in its new  cars. General Motors’ engineering manager for new refrigerants Curt Vincent told trade magazine Automotive News: ‘We did crash tests, computer simulations and thermal analysis and did not observe any safety problems at all. ‘Many have tried to repeat Daimler's findings, but no one has come forward with anything that would indicate any concern.’","Mercedes say the 'climate-friendly' chemical is highly flammable .

A convicted rapist is thought to have murdered a British student 23 years ago, a court has been told. Thierry Villetard has been named in French court documents as a suspect for the killing of 20-year-old Joanna Parrish, although he has not yet been placed under formal investigation. The 46-year-old lorry driver comes from the French town of Auxerre, where languages student Miss Parrish was working as an English teacher when she died in May 1990. Unsolved: Twenty three years after Miss Parrish's death, convicted rapist Thierry Villetard has been named in French court documents as a suspect, although he has not yet been placed under formal investigation . An angler found her naked body floating in a river a few miles from Auxerre. She had been raped and strangled. The murder investigation was reopened last year after witnesses – including a former girlfriend of Villetard from 1990 – came forward with what was described as ‘compelling evidence’. The girlfriend claimed Villetard returned home one evening in May 1990 with scratches on his arms and a denim bag similar to the one Miss Parrish was carrying on the evening she disappeared. Other witnesses have told police in Auxerre, which is in Burgundy between Paris and Lyon, that he boasted of killing two women. He is said to have dumped one of the bodies in a river near Auxerre and the other at a motorway rest area. Victim: Joanna Parrish was 20-years-old when she was murdered in 1990 while working as an English teacher in the French town of Auxerre . Villetard, who is described as a ‘habitual sexual attacker’ and is serving an eight-year sentence for rape, is now on trial in Montpellier in southern France accused of  raping the 15-year-old daughter of another girlfriend. In court yesterday he said he ‘remembered nothing’ about the alleged sex attack on the teenager. A prosecutor asked the judge to impose a 17-year-jail sentence on him. The court has been told that Villetard is also suspected of killing Miss Parrish in 1990 and another woman whose body was found beside a motorway in Provence in southern France in 1997. It is understood that a judge in . Paris heading the cold case investigation into Miss Parrish’s murder . will interview Villetard once the trial in Montpellier is concluded. The . Leeds University student, who came from Newnham on Severn in . Gloucestershire, had arranged to meet a man who had answered her advert . for English lessons. She was engaged and was hoping to . make some money for her wedding. Her body was found the next day. Miss . Parrish’s parents, Roger and Pauline, have never given up the struggle . to bring their daughter’s killer to justice. They have long been . critical of the French investigation. Journalists . and police were allowed to contaminate the crime scene so detectives . were left with few clues. Vital DNA evidence was lost, files went . missing and leads were not followed up properly. Until now the main suspect has been French serial killer Michel Fourniret, but he has never been tried. Fourniret . was nicknamed ‘the Beast of the Ardennes’ after he lured seven girls, . aged 12 to 21, to remote spots before strangling, shooting or stabbing . them.  He was jailed for life in 2008 for their murder. His wife, . Monique Olivier, is also in prison for life for complicity. Fourniret . was placed under investigation for Miss Parrish’s murder after his wife . told police that he had killed an English girl while he was living near . Auxerre. It later emerged that Olivier’s statement had been made under duress, with a prosecutor slapping her during an interrogation.

This daring athlete is pictured testing out a new extreme sport - riding mammoth 30ft waves on a pair of water skis. Chuck Patterson is believed to be the first person to ever attempt wave skiing and he seems to have perfected the sport already. In contrast to water skiing, where you are always towed along by a motorboat, wave skiers are released at the peak of a wave to ski 'freestyle'. Scroll down for video . World first: Chuck Patterson is thought to be the first person to ever attempt wave skiing - riding waves on a pair of skis with poles . In action: Chuck Patterson is pictured riding huge waves up to 30ft high at an offshore reef near Santa Barbara, California, America . After letting go of the rope from the jet ski, Patterson can reach speeds up to 30mph as he rides the huge waves. Photographer Greg Huglin captured these incredible images of Patterson catching huge waves at an offshore reef near Santa Barbara, California, America. Patterson, who is already at professional level in orthodox skiing and surfing, even uses ski poles when wave skiing. The poles are of no real use in the water except to help him maintain the same balance and positioning as he would when skiing on snow. He has also had a pair of custom made skis to use which are a combination of water skis and the skis used on snow. The extreme athlete, 43, who lives in California, said: 'The unpredictability of the water is what makes wave skiing so difficult. 'The sport feels similar to skiing on snow in warm temperatures when the snow is soft. Adrenaline seekers: Wave skiers are towed along by a powerboat - similar to water skiing - but are then released at the crest of a wave so they can ski it 'freestyle' Dedicated: Photographer Greg Huglin went to great lengths to secure these astonishing images - taking pictures from helicopters, boats and the shoreline . Challenging: Chuck Patterson is released by the motorboat at high speeds on to the crest of the wave which he can then ski . 'You have got to have knowledge of the ocean and the energy of the water to be able to do it. 'The feeling when you drop in off a wave is a bit sketchy at first just because you're going so fast. 'I . don't think there is anyone else in the world doing it but for me it is . just a bit of fun alongside my surfing and snow skiing. 'I've . tried it without the ski poles and it felt very strange - they help me . with balance and keeping my body in the correct position.' Mr Huglin also put together a composition of shots to help show how Patterson catches the waves on a pair of skis. The . photographer will shoot from a variety of places, including on board a . helicopter, on a boat or on the shore, to get the best pictures. Mr Huglin, 60, from California, said: 'What Chuck is doing is unique and I don't know of anyone anywhere who can do this on waves. 'I think he has invented a new sport and I believe he will ride larger and larger waves on his skis and perfect the technique. 'It is pretty ridiculous how good he is and I think he is capable of dropping in off waves as big as 50ft tall. 'I've been photographing Chuck for eight years now and you can't help but like the guy, he is such a tremendous athlete too. 'Wave skiing is pretty dangerous as you are travelling at such a speed - you have to be a pro surfer as well as pro skier to have the ability to do it. 'To imagine how difficult it is, I think you would have to compare it to skiing in an avalanche.

Samsung is believed to be secretly preparing a new version of its Galaxy handset that uses a radical 'bendable' screen that is virtually unbreakable. Codenamed 'Project J' after mobile division chief JK Shin, development of the new Galaxy S IV could be released as early as April, according to analysts and tech blogs. Experts believe that as smartphones increasingly look alike, an unbreakable screen could be a big selling point for the Galaxy, which is battling Apple iPhone to lead the $200 billion plus smartphone market. Scroll down for video . Bendy: Samsung is gearing up to produce the next generation of mobile phone screens that can be bent and twisted by early next year, according to reports . Flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface. Regular . LED displays are usually made on a glass surface, but substituting that . for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it . possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight. One possible mass-production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing. The Galaxy S IV is also expected to have bigger and better display, powerful quad-core processing power and a 13-megapixel camera, with picture density improving to 441 pixels per inch (ppi), a big improvement from the Galaxy S III's 306 ppi and better than the iPhone 5's 326 ppi. 'Looking to the first half of 2013, we see evidence of Samsung likely accelerating the release of the Galaxy S IV - compared with May (this year) for the Galaxy S III,' said UBS analyst Nicolas Gaudois. 'We believe preparations for volume manufacturing of unbreakable plastic substrate displays continue. 'All in all, we could see a strong products push in the high-end in the first half, followed by other releases.' Samsung, a major backer of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display, is a frontrunner in developing unbreakable screens, as OLED panels can replace glass substrate with plastic material. Down the road, mobile gadgets could be flexible as well as unbreakable.""Eventually, they'll have unbreakable and flexible displays. Either the Galaxy S IV or S V will have unbreakable and even possibly flexible and foldable displays by 2014. That's going to be a game-changer,"" said Mark Newman, an analyst at Stanford Bernstein in Hong Kong.Both Newman and Gaudois are ranked as 5-star analysts, the top ranking, by Thomson Reuters StarMine for their recommendations on Samsung. Bendy: The breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil . Durable: Although being bendy is their most exciting characteristic, simply using plastic to manufacture the screens rather than glass could help make phone screens less likely to crack . It would also be a game-changer for Samsung, which has built its reputation as a 'fast follower' of others' technologies and designs. The South Korean consumer electronics giant faces off against Apple again on Thursday in a U.S. courtroom for a follow-up ruling on whether it copied some of its U.S. rival's patents and should pay the $1 billion awarded to Apple by jurors in an August verdict. Samsung wants the verdict overturned, while Apple wants the damages to be increased and Samsung phones banned in the United States. Since that landmark verdict, however, Samsung shares have gained 14 percent to record highs, while Apple shares - dented by a maps app fiasco, tight supply of its iPhone 5 and ever tougher competition in the mobile market - have slipped by nearly a fifth, wiping more than $120 billion off its market value. Barring any extra costs related to the U.S. ruling, Samsung should report a fifth straight record profit this quarter, as profits from its component business recover and more than offset thinning margins on mobile phones - squeezed by higher year-end holiday marketing campaigns. 'Samsung's strength extends beyond cool products, they're also a leader in the technology behind these devices. The Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone - the next version could have a radical news 'bendy' screen, according to rumours . 'We see further upside to Samsung's stock as success in smartphones continues and chips and display profits also rebound,' said Newman. 'In smartphones, the opportunity is for Samsung to take more share from Apple in the premium segment, where Apple is still dominant.' UBS estimates Samsung will ship around 22.5 million of its Galaxy S III and Note II devices in the quarter to end-December, up from 20 million in July-September. Shin said in November that Galaxy S III sales would hit 40 million by the end of this month. In a worst-case scenario for Samsung, U.S. judge Lucy Koh could treble the damages payable to Apple, given the jury in August found Samsung 'willfully' infringed some Apple patents. That would be a major blow to Samsung's fundamentals and overall investor sentiment, but it's not the most likely scenario,' said Young Park, a 4-star StarMine analyst at Woori Investment & Securities.","Followup to Galaxy S3 handset could have radical new screen technology .

Goldman Sachs was accused of a ‘lack of sensitivity’ last night after handing out average pay and perks of £250,000 – a rise of 5 per cent. A pot of £8.1billion will be shared among its 32,400 staff – including 6,000 in Britain – after profits soared 70 per cent to £4.7billion last year.The huge award, which would take the average worker in the UK almost 10 years to earn, comes despite growing calls from campaigners and politicians for banks to show more restraint on pay. Critics said the ‘spirit of Gordon Gekko is alive and well’ at the bank, referring to the notorious trader portrayed by Michael Douglas in 1980s film Wall Street who infamously boasted that ‘greed is good’.News of the rise comes after Goldman was forced into a humiliating climb down this week over plans to delay paying its bonuses until after April 6, when the top rate of tax is cut from 50p  to 45p. The U-turn came after Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King branded the idea ‘depressing’, accusing the bank of ‘lacking care and attention’ to the rest of society. The world’s most powerful investment bank, which earned the nickname ‘Golden Sacks’ over its sky-high pay and perks, reaped the rewards as its profits soared 70 per cent to £4.7billion last year. 'The spirit of Gordon Gekko is alive and well at Goldman Sachs' David Hillman, Robin Hood Tax campaign . David Hillman, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: ‘The spirit of Gordon Gekko is alive and well at Goldman Sachs - their bankers’ earnings have increased close to an eye-watering ten times the average UK salary.

These include huge fines for HSBC and Standard Chartered for money laundering, as well as penalties for Barclays and Swiss bank UBS for rigging interest rates. But it hit the headlines last March when a former senior trader published an open resignation letter criticising the bank’s ‘toxic’ culture and accused senior executives at the bank of calling clients ‘muppets’ behind their backs. U-turn: Bank of England chief Mervyn King called Goldman Sachs' plan to delay paying out bonuses until the top rate of tax was cut 'depressing' Goldman defended its pay awards, stressing that its has slashed the share of revenues paid in salary and benefits to 37.9 per cent in 2012, from 42.4 per cent the previous year. Deborah Hargreaves, chair of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘Goldman should be applauded for abandoning plans to delay paying bonuses to cut their tax rate.

It may sound like something out of a sci-fi film, but reading text messages off contact lens in the eyes could soon be a reality - bringing a whole new meaning to the term 'instant messaging'. Scientists have developed a new technology that allows electronic messages sent from mobile phones to be directly projected on to contact lens placed in the recipient's eyes. The spherical curved LCD display, created by Belgian researchers at Ghent University, handle projected images using wireless technology. Scroll down for video . The researcher have shown off the contact lens, which contains a working LCD display. They say it could one day be used to show emails and other information - and even lead to 'Google glasses' without the glasses . The lens' capability were demonstrated by scientists who showed a dollar sign being projected on to the lens. It is a step towards 'fully pixelated contact lens displays' with the same detail as a TV screen which could completely transform the way we communicate. 'Normally, flexible displays using liquid crystal cells are not designed to be formed into a new shape, especially not a spherical one,' said Jelle De Smet, the main researcher on the project. 'Thus, the main challenge was to create a very thin, spherically curved substrate with active layers that could withstand the extreme molding processes,” he said. 'Moreover, since we had to use very thin polymer films, their influence on the smoothness of the display had to be studied in detail. 'By using new kinds of conductive polymers and integrating them into a smooth spherical cell, we were able to fabricate a new LCD-based contact lens display.' Not far off: The lens that can receive text messages could be ready to go on sale in just a few years . The new technology means the entire surface of the contact lens can be used to project images and messages. Researchers are also looking at the possibility of also using the lens as sunglasses which adapt to the level of sunlight. Jelle De Smet, the chief researcher on the project, added: 'This is not science fiction. 'This will never replace the cinema screen for films.

A police chief who was just a fortnight away from retirement was shot dead and four more officers were injured as a gunman opened fire during a drugs bust. Chief Michael Maloney, 48, was killed as officers attempted to serve a search warrant in Greenland, New Hampshire last night. Today the gunman remained holed up inside the property with a woman, police said. Shot dead: Chief Michael Maloney, 48, he was killed as he executed a search warrant in Greenland last night - less than two weeks before his retirement . Streets in the area had been cordoned off as a stand-off ensued. Two officers were also shot in the chest, another was hit in the arm and a fourth was hit in the shoulder. The alleged gunman inside the property was named as Cullen Mutrie, who has previously been indicted on drugs charges, Fox News reported. The killing of Chief Michael Maloney, who has worked as a police officer for the last 26 years, has devastated Greenland, a town of just 3,500 people. 'In those final days, he sacrificed his life in public service as a law enforcement officer in New Hampshire,' Attorney General Michael Delaney said today. The officer had spent the last 12 years as chief of the Greenland department. John Penacho, chairman of the town's Board of Selectman, said Maloney was married with children. 'It's a blow to all of us. You're stunned. It's New Hampshire, it's a small town,' he said. 'We're stunned. I mean all of us. It's an unbelievable situation.' Killing: Chief Michael Maloney was shot dead and four more officers were wounded. Today the gunman was still holed up inside the property . Jacqueline DeFreze, who lives half a mile down the road from the house where the shooting happened, said she was devastated to hear the chief had been shot. 'I'm a wreck. He was just the greatest guy,' said Ms DeFreze, a fourth-grade teacher in nearby Rye. 'He's kind-hearted, always visible in the community.' Governor John Lynch was at Portsmouth Regional Hospital, where the officers were taken. He asked residents to pray for the injured officers and Maloney's family. 'My thoughts and prayers and those of my wife, Susan, are with the family of Chief Michael Maloney. Chief Maloney's unwavering courage and commitment to protecting others serves as an example to us all,' he said. Stand-off: More police officers arrive on the scene in Greenland last night after the police chief and four officers were shot . Killing: The shootings happened in a two-bedroom property on a tree-lined street in Greenland. It has been cordoned off at both ends . The tree-lined street where the shooting happened features single-family homes and duplexes. The shootings happened at a two-bedroom single storey property. Steroids were allegedly found in the property when officers went to confiscate guns after Mutrie was arrested on domestic assault charges in July 2010. The town's schools will be closed today, because law enforcement officers are using the elementary school as a staging area. Asked what the town will do to help residents cope with the tragedy, Penacho said 'We'll do whatever we need to do.' The other officers shot were Detective Gregory Turner, 32, from the Dover police department, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the shoulder and later released. Detective Eric Kulberg, 31, from the University of New Hampshire police department, who was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm and released. Detective Scott Kukesh, 33, from the Newmarket police department, who was in intensive care awaiting surgery for a gunshot wound to the chest.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:46 EST, 26 August 2011 . The television historian David Starkey brought his profession into disrepute when he made controversial race remarks on BBC's Newsnight, a group of leading academics have said. More than 100 historians, academics and graduate students signed an open letter criticising Starkey's failure to grasp the subtleties of race and class, which they said 'would disgrace a first-year undergraduate'. The broadcaster provoked a race storm earlier this month when he appeared on the Newsnight programme as a panelist, discussing the UK rioting. Scroll down to watch the video . David Starkey sparked anger as he suggested that black 'gangster' culture had become the norm . He was branded a racist after claiming the riots happened because too many young white . people had ‘now become black’ and blamed a ‘violent, destructive and nihilistic’ gang culture, . which he said was being embraced by many white and black people. The open letter, published by the Times Higher Education magazine, is signed by more than 100 of Starkey's contemporaries. In it, the signatories question why Starkey - who specialises in Tudor history - was invited by the BBC to talk about race riots when his academic works have nothing to do with it. Describing the selection of Starkey as a panelist as a 'poor choice', the letter says: 'We are thus unsurprised by the poverty of his reductionist argument, which reflected his lack of understanding of the history of ordinary life in modern Britain. It was evidentially insupportable and factually wrong. David Starkey, right, talks to Emily Maitlis during the controversial broadcast . 'His crass generalisations about black culture and white culture as oppositional, monolithic entities demonstrate a failure to grasp the subtleties of race and class that would disgrace a first-year history undergraduate. 'In fact, it appears to us that the BBC was more interested in employing him for his on-screen persona and tendency to make comments that viewers find offensive than for his skills as a historian.' The signatories - which included academics from Cambridge and the London School of  Economics, both institutions where Starkey once taught - said he was 'ill-fitted' to speak on the matter. It added: 'Instead of thoughtfully responding to criticism, he simply shouted it down; instead of debating his fellow panelists from a position of knowledge, he belittled and derided them. 'We the undersigned would therefore ask that the BBC and other broadcasters think carefully before they next invite Starkey to comment as a historian on matters for which his historical training and record of teaching, research and publication have ill-fitted him to speak.' Controversy: David Starkey, left, said that Enoch Powell's infamous anti-immigration speech was correct in one aspect . Even after the furore surrounding his comments, historian Starkey remained defiant. The . broadcaster stunned his fellow guests on the BBC2 show, writer Owen . Jones and black author and broadcaster Dreda Say Mitchell, by placing . the blame for the riots squarely with a form of black male culture that . he said ‘mitigated against education’. He said: ‘A substantial section of . the chavs have become black. The whites have become black. A particular . sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the . fashion. ‘Black and white, boy and girl . operate in this language together. This language which is wholly false, . which is a Jamaican patois, that’s been intruded in England and this is . why so many of us have this sense of literally a foreign country.’ Dr Starkey denied he had . said anything racist and said he stood by his comments, reiterating that in times of economic and political crisis, ‘plain speaking’ was . needed. Riots: Mr Starkey claims the unrest was caused by the spread of black gang culture . He said last month: ‘I said . until I was blue in the face on the programme that I was not talking . about skin colour but gang culture. A large group of whites have started . to behave like blacks. I think that is the most unracial remark anyone . can make.’ Dr Starkey caused further outrage on . Newsnight by claiming that if people listened to David Lammy, the MP for . Tottenham, on the radio, they would assume he was white. Following his comments on Newsnight, he added: ‘David Lammy . does sound white, so does [MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington] . Diane Abbott, because they’ve had a white cultural experience. It’s one . of the reasons they don’t have any street credibility. They have no . contact with the young.' The historian also revealed he had reread . former Minister Enoch Powell’s infamous ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in . light of the tensions. He said: ‘His prophecy was absolutely . right in one sense. The Tiber didn’t foam with blood but flames . lambent. They wrapped around Tottenham and around Clapham.’","Open letter criticises Starkey's 'crass generalisations'

Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney phoned his British counterpart last night to complain about claims that horsemeat DNA tests by the Irish authorities were based on 'local intelligence' Agriculture Minister Simon Coveney phoned his British counterpart last night to complain about claims that horsemeat DNA tests by the Irish authorities were based on ‘local intelligence’. Officials in Mr Coveney’s department and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland both repeated their denials in recent weeks of any ‘tip-off’ that led to the new tests, which have sparked an international scandal. The British Secretary of State for the Environment Owen Paterson said in the House of Commons that the FSAI was acting on ‘local intelligence’ – claiming Mr Coveney had personally confirmed this to him. The department and the FSAI have maintained since the scandal broke that horse DNA was discovered during routine testing and not because of a tip from a whistleblower. Speaking on Monday in the House of Commons, Mr Paterson said: ‘The reason the Irish agency picked up this issue in the Irish plant was that it had local intelligence that there was a problem. That is why it did a random check, I cleared that with Minister Coveney today.’ In response to inquiries about Mr Paterson’s allegations, a spokeswoman for Mr Coveney first said she could not comment, and then revealed that the minister had called Mr Paterson last night to reach agreement that this was ‘not the position’. She added that she had ‘no idea’ where the term ‘local intelligence’ originated. The row comes as increasing numbers of Irish firms are linked with the scandal. Lancashire County Council in Britain removed prepared cottage pies from 47 school kitchens after traces of horse DNA were found in the meals. These had been provided by Oak Farm Foods, a division of Dawn Fresh Foods. The Queally family, including brothers John and Peter, controls the company, as well as Dawn Meats, the firm that provides one in every five burgers sold in Europe by McDonald’s. The Queally brothers are also directors of QK Meats Naas Ltd and QK Cold Stores. QK Cold Stores has recently reported to authorities that tests on imported meat products tested positive for horse DNA. On Thursday, UK supermarket chain Asda withdrew bolognese sauces supplied by Irish company Greencore following tests that revealed the presence of horsemeat. Secretary of State for the Environment, Food, & Rural Affairs Owen William Paterson (right) in the House of Commons that the FSAI was acting on 'local intelligence' - claiming Mr Coveney (left) had personally confirmed this to him . The CEO of Greencore is Patrick Coveney, the Agriculture Minister’s brother. The horsemeat scandal has swept across Europe and criminal investigations are being carried out in at least three countries. In Britain, three men were arrested last week on suspicion of fraud as authorities investigated the possible mislabelling of meat. One of the men, 63-year-old Peter Boddy, owns an abattoir in West Yorkshire now under investigation. He also had a contract with Aintree Racecourse for destroying the carcasses of injured horses. Mr Boddy and the other men were released on bail yesterday pending further police inquiries.The saga began last month with the discovery of horsemeat in beef burgers from a division of Larry Goodman’s processing empire in Co. Monaghan. Mr Coveney has insisted Irish horses cannot enter the food chain, saying there is strong traceability in the system. However, when an Irish Mail on Sunday investigation revealed that official records for Charlie, an abandoned horse rescued in Longford, incorrectly showed he had been slaughtered, the minister was forced to admit problems do exist and the extent of confusion with the passport system is growing. ‘Where tampered passports accompanying horses to slaughter are detected, it is the policy that such animals are destroyed and removed from the food chain. My department has received a small number of complaints in this area,’ Mr Coveney said. According to the minister, 24,000 horses were slaughtered in Ireland last year. Almost half of these were slaughtered in abattoirs run by local authorities. A spokesman for the department said it is now considering taking these under its own control, but he did not reveal why. There is no central registration for counting horses in Ireland. The spokesman added: ‘The department is developing a central database of horses.’ Some of Ireland’s top racehorses may have passed through the hands of the slaughterhouse owner arrested in Britain this week – including five that died during the Aintree Grand National. While there has been speculation about thoroughbred racehorses being slaughtered for the meat industry, this is the first time a direct link has been established. Aintree Racecourse confirmed to the MoS that Peter Boddy, one of three people arrested by police on Tuesday on suspicion of fraud, was the sole contractor to remove injured and dying horses from the legendary steeplechase at Aintree, where five Irish horses died in recent years. Among them were Irish Grand National winner Hear The Echo, owned by Michael O’Leary’s wife, Anita; and Dooney’s Gate, owned by legendary trainer Willie Mullins. Some of Ireland's top racehorses may have passed through the hands of the slaughterhouse owner arrested in Britain this week - including Grand National winner Hear The Echo, owned by Michael O'Leary's wife . An Aintree spokesman declined definitively to confirm that the Irish horses had been disposed of by Mr Boddy, saying that some may have gone to Leahurst Veterinary Hospital for postmortems.But an Irish expert explained that horses taken to the hospital would then be sent on to the slaughterhouse anyway. Professor Des Leadon of the Irish Equine Centre said: ‘The vet makes the final decision when a horse is dying. Insurers may ask for a postmortem. They are carried out at the Equine Centre. Then they go to Category 2 plants known as knackeries. We document the number of horses that enter the plants.’ Prof Leadon explained that because racehorses often had to be given medicine, they were not supposed to enter the food chain. The British Food Standards Authority said: ‘Three individuals were arrested by Dyfed-Powys Police on suspicion of fraud, as a result of the agency’s investigation into the use of horse meat in the food chain.’ The other two men arrested are linked to Farmbox Meats in Wales. All three were released yesterday. Aintree Racecourse confirmed Mr Boddy was employed to remove injured horses when necessary, including horses that died during or shortly after a race at the course. The Grand National is the best-known race at the Liverpool venue. A spokesman said Mr Boddy had worked with the racecourse for the past six to seven years. During this time, eight racehorses died during or shortly after the race. Five of these were bred in Ireland and three were either owned by Irish people or trained in Ireland. One Grand National casualty, Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Synchronised, owned by JP McManus, was buried but in most cases, the owners of horses that die during a race left the animal’s disposal to the racetrack. The disposal of Mr O’Leary’s horse Hear The Echo was left to Aintree. Asked about the horse, a spokesman for Mr O’Leary’s Gigginstown stud said: ‘He died on the racecourse of a heart attack.’ Asked what had been done with the horse’s carcass, he said: ‘The racecourse took care of that.’    Mr Boddy was taken from his slaughterhouse in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, for questioning about the supply and use of horsemeat in products purporting to be beef for burgers and kebabs. A spokesperson for Dyfed-Powys Police said yesterday: ‘We can confirm that three men arrested on suspicion of offences under the fraud act have been released on bail pending further inquiries. They will return to answer bail in Aberystwyth at a later date.’","British Secretary of State for the .

Pilot: Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, was preparing for a flight to New York this morning when he was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol . A pilot for American Airlines subsidiary American Eagle has been arrested as he prepared to fly some 53 passengers from Minneapolis to New York City while drunk. Police were tipped off by witnesses who said Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, smelled like booze, as he was conducting preflight checks in the cockpit of a Bombardier CRJ-700 aircraft. Officers boarded the plane at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport just before 6:30 a.m today and made the pilot, from Raleigh, North Carolina, take a breathalyzer test, which he failed. He was then arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol and taken into custody. 'There was a witness who smelled what they thought was alcohol on the pilot's breath and notified police,' airport spokesman Patrick Hogan said. Passengers had not yet boarded the flight to La Guardia, New York City, he said. American Airlines has suspended Kristiansen pending an investigation into his boozing, according to spokesman Matt Miller.He added that the carrier was cooperating with authorities. Flight 4590 was delayed about two-and-a-half hours while a replacement pilot was arranged. The aircraft finally took off at 8.50am and arrived in New York at 12:11p.m. Kristiansen was taken to Fairview Southdale Hospital to have a blood sample taken for testing, before he was returned to the custody of airport police.

But he said . the alcohol limit for flying is lower than for driving a car. 'In Minnesota, the legal limit for pilots is 0.04, much stricter than someone traveling on a road in the state,' he said. American Airlines said in a statement: 'American Eagle has a well-established substance . abuse policy that is designed to put the safety of our customers and . employees first. We are cooperating with authorities and conducting a . full internal investigation. The pilot will be withheld from service . pending the outcome of the investigation.' Departing: The pilot was arrested and escorted off the plane at the Minneapolis St.Paul International Airport, pictured, at around 6.30am . Along with the 0.04 percent limit, Federal Aviation Administration regulations also prohibit any pilot from flying within eight hours of drinking alcohol, what the agency calls 'bottle to throttle,' according to the Star Tribune. 'A hangover effect ... may be just as dangerous as the intoxication itself,' the FAA claims. 'Consider the effects of a hangover. Eight hours from 'bottle to throttle' does not mean you are in the best physical condition to fly or that your blood-alcohol concentration is below the legal limits.' Between 10 and 13 commercial pilots a year have been found with a 'confirmed breath alcohol concentration"" of 0.04 per cent or higher since 2008. In 2002, 22 pilots were found to be over the limit.","Kolbjorn Jarle Kristiansen, 48, was conducting preflight checks in the cockpit of a .

It was on a much smaller scale than the 20,000 people organisers Adbusters, an online magazine, had wanted to see when they launched the occupation idea in July. Protests: Americans gather near Wall Street in New York to voice their frustration with the economy . Shouts: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in Manhattan, New York, for the demonstrations on Saturday .

Hundreds of people had gathered near Wall Street with backpacks and sleeping bags to search for a place to camp, but police were there to keep them away from the main financial area.

A convicted murderer has protested his innocence in an unprecedented YouTube video filmed behind bars. Luke Mitchell, 24, is serving a life sentence in a Scottish prison for the brutal murder of his teenage girlfriend Jodi Jones. But now, in a landmark move, prison authorities have given permission for footage shot in jail to be made public. Scroll down for video . Unprecedented: Convicted murderer Luke Mitchell is pictured in prison denying killing his girlfriend Jodi Jones while hooked up to a lie detector in a YouTube video . Protesting his innocence: Mitchell - who is serving a life sentence for the killing of Jodi Jones who was found dead near her home in Easthouse, Dalkeith, Midlothian, in June 2003 - has always being involved in her murder . The dramatic video clip - which is today being broadcast on the internet - shows Mitchell denying his involvement in Jodi’s murder while wired up to a lie detector machine. The extraordinary move is believed to be the first time a convicted criminal has ever been seen taking - and passing - a polygraph test while in prison. Mitchell, who has consistently denied killing 14-year-old Jodi, hopes that releasing the clip onto the internet will persuade the public that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Found guilty: Mitchell was found guilty of murdering his girlfriend Jodi Jones by a jury in 2005 . At the end of last week, he told his mother: 'I want the world to see that I actually went through this process and it backed what I have always said - that I didn’t kill Jodi.' As revealed in the Scottish Mail on Sunday, Mitchell passed a lie detector test carried out by an independent expert in a prison visiting room last April. As is normal practice, the test was filmed. Campaigners backing Mitchell applied to the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to use the footage to help clear his name. Permission from the SPS was required because the clip was filmed within prison grounds. And last week the governor of Shotts Prison, the top-security jail where Mitchell is being held, gave the go-ahead. The footage shows Mitchell dressed in a standard prison-issue blue tee-shirt being asked a series of questions - including three key questions related directly to the murder. Mitchell, jailed for a minimum of 20 years in January 2005, was shown to be telling the truth when he denied being involved. The convicted killer was interviewed by experienced polygraph examiner Terry Mullins,  secretary of the British Polygraph Association, who has carried out a string of lie tests in English prisons although  the examination of Mitchell has been his only work in a jail north of the border. The release of the video is the first time footage of one of his prison tests has been shown publicly. Mitchell’s mother Corinne said her son was delighted that the public can now watch him passing the test. Ongoing battle: Luke Mitchell, pictured on Sky News shortly after the discovery of Jodi Jones' body, has always maintained his innocence and repeatedly asked for polygraph tests . Family support: Luke Mitchell with his mother Corinne, 53, has always stood by her son . Murdered schoolgirl: Mitchell was ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years for the murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend Jodi Jones, pictured . Mrs Mitchell, 53, who visited him on Thursday, said: 'He says he has never had anything to hide so he didn’t hesitate when he had the chance to take it. In fact, he had asked for a polygraph since day one. 'Luke told me he believes the test is a crucial indication of his innocence to go along with other issues, such as the lack of forensic evidence linking him to the crime.' Mrs Mitchell has also passed a lie test, backing her claim that she was with the convicted killer at their home at the time of the murder. Missing: Jodi Jones was found murdered in June 2003 near her home in Dalkeith . During his polygraph examination, the camera focuses on Mitchell, who tries to remain still throughout as any movement can affect the monitoring process. On the advice of the examiner, he keeps his eyes closed throughout. Mr Mullins is heard putting a series of questions to Mitchell three times, changing the order on each occasion. Answering the three questions directly relating to the murder, Mitchell clearly says “No” when asked: “Were you present when Jodi was stabbed?” In answer to the question: 'Did you stab Jodi on June 30, 2003?', Mitchell responds: 'No' in a strong voice. He speaks more quietly as he repeats: 'No' when asked: 'Did you know for certain where Jodi’s body would be found?' The question was asked in light of evidence in court that Mitchell led searchers to Jodi’s body because he knew where it was. He has always claimed his dog alerted him to the gruesome discovery. After the tests were carried out last year, Mr Mullins concluded that Mitchell had been telling the truth. He said: ‘I’m certain of the test result. It’s absolute. I can’t believe Luke Mitchell was convicted on the evidence that was available.’ He said Mitchell appeared confident but slightly nervous as he arrived to undertake the test process, which took nearly two-and-a-half hours. Mr Mullins explained: ‘Most people are nervous because of the unfamiliar technology rather than the fear of failing. Luke Mitchell's mother Corinne Mitchell at Edinburgh High Court when he was found guilty of murder, left in 2005, and after he was refused leave to appeal his conviction to UK's highest court, pictured right in 2011 . Results: The test found that Mitchell was telling the truth when he said he had no involvement in the murder of Jodi Jones . 'I spoke to him at length about what happened on the day of the murder, from before leaving school, and up to the next day. 'He got very upset when he began recalling the moment when he found Jodi’s body. During the test I asked him to close his eyes so he could concentrate and not be distracted by the prison officers who were observing through the glass walls of the meeting room. 'At the end I asked him how he thought he’d got on. He confidently said: “I’ve passed”. He was right.’ Young: Luke Mitchell was just 14 when his girlfriend was murdered near their homes in Midlothian . Mitchell was just 14 when Jodi was brutally murdered near their homes in Midlothian after she had gone out to meet him. He was 16 when he was found guilty after a marathon trial that culminated in 2005. Jodi was found behind a wall beside a lonely path near her home in Easthouses. She had suffered a slashed throat and post-mortem cuts to her eyelids, right cheek, left breast, abdomen and right forearm. There was also a penetrating wound to her mouth and her hands had been tied. Mitchell has always insisted he wasn’t guilty of the horrific slaying but failed to have his conviction quashed on appeal. His case is currently being examined by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice and can recommend a fresh appeal. Polygraph tests are inadmissible in Scottish courts but the report on Mitchell’s test was included in his submission to the SCCRC. Criminologist Dr Sandra Lean, who has spearheaded the campaign to free Mitchell along with his mother, said the lie test provided important evidence. 'The polygraph result in Luke’s case reinforces what the other evidence has been telling us all along – there is not a scrap of evidence that Luke Mitchell murdered Jodi Jones,' she insisted. She criticised Mitchell’s prosecution, insisting: 'The case against him was ""purely circumstantial"" – bits and pieces cobbled together to try to make a justifiable case. 'Yet the real evidence shows the prosecution case to be untenable,' she claimed. A Scottish Prison Service spokesman confirmed: 'The SPS had no objection to the release of the footage, with the consent of Mr Mitchell.'","Jodi Jones, 14, was found dead in woods near her Midlothian home in 2003 .

This is the smiling face of Zina Haughton, pictured for the first time since she was gunned down by her estranged husband on Sunday. Ms Haughton was among three women killed by 45-year-old Radcliffe Haughton during his terrifying shooting spree at a day spa in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Haughton opened fire days after his wife was granted a restraining order preventing him from going near her, having taken to Facebook to appeal for help in escaping the state. Four other victims, all female, were shot before Haughton turned the gun on himself. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Tragic: Zina Haughton was among those shot dead by her estranged husband on Sunday at the spa where she worked . 34-year-old Cary L. Robuck of Racine and 38-year-old Maelyn M. Lind of Oconomowoc have been named as the other fatalities. Ms Robuck, a nail technician at the . spa, and mother-of-two had intended to spend Sunday with her . Grandfather, but was called into work at the last minute. As news spread of the shooting her family and friends faced an agonising wait to find out whether she had been caught up in the tragedy. Learning the awful truth, they posted messages on her Facebook wall, paying tribute to a 'truly . wonderful and kind person'. Cary Robuck is among the victims from the Brookfield spa shooting Sunday . 'Cary was gentle, sweet and . soft-spoken,' a colleague told the Mount Pleasant Patch. 'She was very . popular with her clients. They really loved her.' Haughton was targeting his estranged wife when he arrived at the spa at around 11am, police said. Court . records show that a judge issued a order of protection against Haughton . just three days ago on October 18, hinting that there was a credible . threat against her. Under that order, Haughton was prohibited from owning a firearm. It was filed after an October 4 incident at the salon, . where Mrs Haughton worked as a hair stylist, when the enraged 45-year-old slashed his wife's tires in the parking lot. Suicidal: Haughton shot himself dead after going on his terrifying shooting spree . Haughton's two daughters - one of . which was believed to have been at the salon at the time of the shooting . - were found by police and are safe, according to Brown Deer police . chief Steven Rinzel. Chief . Rinzel said that his department was familiar with Haughton - most . recently on a domestic violence investigation at the home, which . resulted in Haughton's arrest. On his Facebook page Haughton wrote about a pressing need to leave his home in Wisconsin. 'Need to get out of Wisconsin. HELP...' he posted on October 8. The next day he followed it up with: 'Can anyone help me get out of Wisconsin?' The Journal Sentinel contacted his father, Radcliffe Haughton Sr., who lives in Florida. He . said the he spoke to his son by phone last week shortly after his . estranged wife had been awarded the restraining order against him. Terrifying: Radcliffe Haughton killed three women and injured four others during his gun-wielding rampage . 'I told him, whatever you do, don't do anything stupid,' Mr Haughton Sr. said. 'He told me, ""I have to get out of Wisconsin."" 'I am so saddened. I don't know what to tell you. As his father, I am very, very sorry and I did not expect this from my son. 'So he hasn't been apprehended? Oh Lord. Have mercy, God. A witness saw a woman screaming, and running out of the spa towards traffic. 'She ran right out into the street (and) was pounding on cars,' David Gosh told The Journal Sentinel. He then saw a man carrying a handgun run after her, and he was thought to be chasing after the woman. The gunman then saw police beginning to gather and he ran back in the direction in which he came, and back into the spa. 'He was the shooter. He was looking for an escape route,' Mr Gosh said. Disturbing: In the weeks leading up to the shooting Haughton appealed for help in leaving Wisconsin on his Facebook page . A restraining order granted in the days before the shooting prevented Radcliffe Haughton from going near his estranged wife . A witness told the Journal-Sentinel that a he saw a young girl running through a parking lot in a panic after her mother was reportedly shot. 'She was screaming, yelling, crying hysterical. She was pleading for help,' Christopher Pfeiffer told the local paper. 'She . kept saying, ""My mother was shot."" And she mentioned that there was a . gunman. She ran into the bookstore and I followed her. But I watched her . from afar.' Live video of the Azana spa shows a tactical team moving in around 2pm on Sunday. According to the spa's website, it boasts that it is the largest salon and day spa in Brookfield with 9,000-square-feet.

The . layout of the spa- which has ten treatment rooms, male and female . locker rooms, and a cafe area-complicates issues for police as people . may be hiding inside.

Tushaus said: 'It appears that he is . deceased of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.'He added: 'There is no other suspect that we are seeking.' During the investigation, cops encountered smoke from a small fire that had been started in the building, prompting them to issue a call for extreme caution and keeping them out. Haughton was described as a bald ethnic man with darker skin, . about 6 foot one inch tall and 270 pounds. He is believed to have taken a taxi to the spa.

Firms will be asked to construct dedicated ‘express lanes’ alongside busy sections of motorways and trunk roads. Drivers using the lanes would be billed per journey, with the profits going to the private sector. Vision of the future: Drivers queue to pay at the M6 toll road booths at Great Wyreley, near Cannock, Staffordshire. A plan to introduce toll lanes across the motorway network is to be proposed by the Government today . Ministers, desperate to get more private sector cash into the economy, believe that by creating extra lanes, the scheme conforms with their pledge not to introduce tolls on existing roads. But the sight of wealthy drivers speeding past could cause resentment among less affluent motorists who already pay massive taxes to be on the road. The initiative is being actively considered as part of the Government’s ‘growth review’ which will be unveiled by Chancellor George Osborne next week. Plans: George Osborne, Chancellor, is set to reveal the road charges as part of the Government's 'growth review' Today David Cameron and Nick Clegg will announce a package of initiatives to kickstart the moribund housing market. These include a £400million fund to build 16,000 new homes and a scheme to underwrite the deposits of first-time buyers. Later they will thrash out the final elements of the growth review with Mr Osborne and the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander. Sources close to Nick Clegg last night said it was vital for both the economy and the Coalition that the review is a success. One said: ‘This is a big moment for the Government. 'We have to show not just that we can cut the deficit, but also that we can get growth going again.’ Other elements being considered in the growth review include: . David Cameron and Nick Clegg, his Lib Dem deputy, right, will announce measures to kickstart the moribund housing market today . Treasury sources indicated last night that the plan for toll lanes is likely to be introduced in a limited form. Roads under consideration include the notorious A14, which links the Suffolk port of Felixstowe and the M11 and A1 to the M1 and M6. Will toll lanes relieve congestion? The dual carriageway has long been a major bottleneck, slowing cargo from the Midlands to the Felixstowe docks. Experts believe automatic numberplate recognition technology could be used to bill motorists who use the new lanes without the need for toll booths. Fines would be levied on drivers who stray into the express lanes. A source at the Department for . Transport confirmed that the Government’s pledge not to introduce tolls . on existing roads does not cover ‘new capacity’. Some . ministers are concerned, however, that the scheme could be seen by the . public as a ‘slippery slope’ towards the wider introduction of road . tolls. Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras, like the one pictured left, could be used to police the system. Right, Mail cartoonist Pugh imagines the future... John Cridland, director general of the CBI, called on ministers to bring forward the initiative, and said firms were ready to invest millions immediately. Mr Cridland said: ‘Let’s have the A14 . widened by road tolling so the Government doesn’t have to pay. It is . money on my members’ balance sheets that pays in return for an income in . future years.’ But Keith Peat of the Association of British Drivers said: ‘We pay £50billion a year in motoring taxes, of which only £7billion goes back into motoring. Many drivers will feel we deserve the very best highways and should not have to pay extra.’ In a major speech to the CBI today, David Cameron will pledge to build a ‘new model of growth’ amid fears that the eurozone crisis could drag Britain back into recession. He will say: ‘Put simply, Britain must become one of the best places to do business on the planet.’","Toll road plan part of government's 'growth review'

One or both of the officers then opened fire, killing Swanson, according to police. She died at the scene around 1.15pm.

The men said they only took pictures because they did not think anyone would believe them without any evidence. A short time later she walked inside a house holding a cross in her hands, they said. 'She held the cross up and made a circle like this and said, ""Antichrist, Antichrist, this meeting is over"",' Mr Eylward explained. 'And as she did that she stopped, turned around and walked back. 'At no time did any of us ever feel threatened and the only thing we ever saw in her hand was the cross,' he said. Fifteen minutes later the 42-year-old was dead. Mr Eylward said: 'This is a tragedy. It is, it really is. I had a friend that I was explaining this to and she asked me why I didn't call the cops right then and there, and as she said that it occurred to me that I should have.

Police have launched an investigation after an 80-year-old patient went missing and was found dead outside a hospital seven hours later. Staff at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital called emergency services when the unidentified elderly man could not be found. Concerns were raised after the man disappeared from inside the hospital at around 7:30pm last night. Officers from Merseyside Police carried out an 'extensive search' of the hospital grounds but were unable to locate the patient. An 80 year-old patient went missing Royal Liverpool University Hospital and was found dead outside the hospital seven hours later . After seven hours and 15 minutes, a body was found at 2:45am outside the hospital building, but within the grounds on the edge of the city centre. Temperatures overnight were just above freezing and there was heavy rain, so conditions would have been harsh on a vulnerable man. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said a Home Office post mortem examination will take place to establish the cause of death. He added: 'The man’s next of kin have been informed but he is yet to be formally identified.' The Royal Liverpool University Hospital is the biggest and busiest hospital on Merseyside with more than 40 wards and more than 750 beds. Last month it was reported that 600 jobs were to be axed at the hospital.

And some councils have been accused of wasting parts of the £100,000 they were presented with, following a review by Mary Portas, on items including the man in the Peppa Pig costume and £5,983 on newspaper adverts. Funding: Councils have spent just 12 per cent of the money awarded to them following the Mary Portas (left) review. One authority however spent £1,600 on a man in a Peppa Pig costume (similar to the one pictured right) Freedom of Information requests, responded to by 11 of the Portas Pilots, found that by December 31, just £136,000 had been spent of the £1.1m awarded, The Independent has reported. The self-styled Queen of Shops was commissioned by the government in 2011 to conduct an independent review of the future of British High Streets. In her resulting 'Portas Review', she found town centres around the country were losing their appeal to locals and identified the need to 'put the heart back into the centre of our High Streets'. She suggested this could be done by making the destinations more than just a place to shop. The government made £2.7m available to run a series of pilots trialling Portas' recommendations and bids were made from towns around the country. But as fashion chain Republic collapses into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk, and following the troubles seen at Blockbusters, HMV and Jessops, retail experts have been angered by the progress of the Portas Pilots. Paul Turner-Mitchell, who submitted the FOI requests, asked why much of the money was still sitting in local authority bank accounts. Queen of Shops: Mary Portas was commissioned by the government in 2011 to conduct an independent review of the future of British High Streets . Mr Turner-Mitchell, a director of Rochdale-based retailer 25 Ten Boutique, said: 'It's disappointing that, given this unique opportunity to try something different, many councils have wasted funding on the usual bureaucracy of meetings, expense claims and consultants.' The FOI requests found Croydon had spent £4,950 of its £1000,000, while Stockport, which received an extra £362,000 from the council and other bodies, had spent just £25,800 of its total. John O'Mara, the chairman of Stockport Town Team, said the money was part of a pilot, which was about new ways of working, and things didn't happen overnight. He said: 'What's important is getting this right, not how quickly we get the money out of the door.' Elsewhere, Dartford Council spent £1,160 hiring a person in a Peppa Pig costume, £317.46 on items from Waitrose, £5,983 on newspaper surveys and £1,317 on surveys. 'The main aim of this scheme has been to . harness the energy and enthusiasm of local people to breathe new life . into the town centres and make them the hearts of their communities once . again' - Department for Communities and Local Government . A Dartford spokeswoman said adverts in local newspapers were used to promote the launch of Sunday trading in the town, a six-month Sunday market pilot, and a bursary scheme for businesses looking to set up in the market. The spokesman said: 'The council hired Peppa Pig for the day as it's a proven way to draw in families to events.' A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: 'The Government has given the Portas Pilots a share of £2.4million to spend as and when they see fit to best improve their high streets and encourage residents to shop locally.'The main aim of this scheme has been to harness the energy and enthusiasm of local people to breathe new life into the town centres and make them the hearts of their communities once again.  Pilots up and down the country are already doing this very successfully, from Nelson bringing empty shops back into use, to Market Rasen backing an award-winning local market.'But this is just the start, which is why Local Growth Minister Mark Prisk has also announced a Future High Streets Forum, made up of leading figures from the retail industry, to provide advice and support to town teams across the country to help their high streets thrive and prosper.'","Portas Pilots have so far spent just 12 per cent of the £1.2m awarded .

An Italian woman has demanded an apology from Silvio Berlusconi after he crudely joked with her about sex, days before a national election. The former Prime Minister asked the woman at a corporate event how many times she enjoyed sex and if he could look at her bottom. He made his remarks in front of a giggling crowd of business people, male and female. Silvio Berlusconi with Angela Bruno who wants the former Prime Minister to apologise for his comments . Angela Bruno, a 30-year-old employee of a renewable energy firm, was presenting a contract to Berlusconi at a recent ceremony when the former prime minister asked her suggestive questions in front of senior colleagues, staff and members of the public. 'Do you come?...only once?...how many times do you come?...with what sort of time intervals?,' he asked her with a smirk on his face. At the time she went along with the banter giggling nervously as the audience roared with laughter. 'It sounds altogether like a good proposal,' he continued. He then asked her to turn around, took a look at her bottom and said, 'Yes, it is a convincing offer', prompting a round of applause and more laughter from men and women in the audience. Berlusconi commented on her appearance and sex life in front of a room of her peers . A video of the exchange has been viewed more than 950,000 times on YouTube and has sparked outrage on social networks. Miss Bruno told an Italian TV channel that her 13-year-old daughter had cried for days after seeing a video of the encounter, and the response it provoked. 'I want an apology for all Italian women because they should not have to suffer insults like this, at work or outside work,' she said. 'This is the Italy I don’t want any more and I hope no one wants.' The 76-year-old media tycoon, who is on trial for sex with an underage prostitute, stepped down as prime minister in November 2011 at the height of the euro zone debt crisis, but is now seeking a fifth term in government in the February 24-25 vote. Roughly two years ago, more than a million Italians joined street rallies in protest against his treatment of women while serving as prime minister, after details of the 'Bunga Bunga' sex parties at his Milan villa began to emerge. Bruno told Italian television on Monday evening that she had tried to keep the conversation on a professional level but had been too intimidated to reprimand Berlusconi in public due to his position of power and the presence of senior staff. In the interview, the married mother-of-one said she had been offended and embarrassed and demanded the apology. 'He may think he is joking but he has to be a serious person if he wants to represent Italy. He can’t get away with presenting an image like this,' Bruno said. Berlusconi did apologise in an interview on Radio 105 on Tuesday, but also said that Bruno had seemed to enjoy herself at the time. He urged her to stop reading leftwing newspapers, which he said had exaggerated the seriousness of the exchange. Italy is about to go to the polls, with a general election taking place this coming weekend.","Angela Bruno, 30, was subjected to lewd comments as she tried to present a contract to Berlusconi .

Shoppers flocked to the grand opening of a city's first daily cannabis market yesterday months after Washington state voted to legalize the drug. Northwest Cannabis Market in Seattle is now open seven days a week selling medicinal marijuana, as well as other dried medicines and edible products. Medicinal sellers are expecting to see business grow as some move into the recreational market after both Washington and Seattle voted to legalize marijuana - the first to do so in the United States. Jeff Simmons allows a customer to smell the marijuana at the grand opening of Northwest Cannabis Market . Last fall, voters in Washington passed Initiative 502, which legalizes the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana for adults aged over 21. The state has also called for the creation of state-licensed pot growers, processors and retail stores. At Northwest Cannabis Market, shoppers on mobility scooters and wheelchairs browsed jars filled with various types of marijuana. Nine permanent vendors are stationed at the market to sell their wares and others set up on irregular days. The market even has a marijuana smoking room where customers can try out different types. Shoppers need to show their doctor's authorisation and Washington State identification in order to buy cannabis. Many medicinal marijuana sellers are expected to see their business grow after recreational use was legalized . The market is the first daily cannabis shop to open in the city and employs nine people . The state's medical marijuana industry is continuing to operate with recreational cannabis sales expected to start later this year. In December, hundreds of people gathered in Seattle to mark the moment the drug became legal in Washington. Colorado followed suit in January.

Travellers: William and John Connors, pictured at an earlier court hearing, were today jailed for three years . Two travellers who housed vulnerable men . in squalid conditions, beat them and made them work for up to 80 hours a . week were today jailed for three years. John Connors, 31, and his . brother-in-law William Connors, 35, lived in comfort while their . ‘employees’ slept in tents and received little or no pay. They were beaten with shovels, had . their hair shaved and were forced to go to the toilet in bushes, . Southampton Crown Court heard. The Connors lured unemployed men who . were homeless or had drink problems into a life of misery with the . promise of work laying block paving or tarmac, accommodation, food, . drink and alcohol. They had their driving licences, . passports and money taken from them and feared they would be tracked . down and beaten if they tried to escape. On occasions they were even forced to fight each other to entertain the other travellers as they placed bets on the winner. One worker - nicknamed ‘Horse’ because . of his strength and efforts - was branded with a tattoo of a . ‘travelling horse’ on his back. The workers - whom had fallen on hard . times after marriage breakdowns - were offered up to £30 a day but . most never received a penny. Prosecutor Charles Thomas told the . court the workers spent their time touting for business, tarmacking and . block-paving drives across the south of England. In the evening the workers were forced . to do ‘demeaning domestic chores’ such as sweeping the encampments and . cleaning out the Connors’ tents and caravans. They washed twice a week when the Connors took them to leisure centres or swimming pools to freshen up. Mr Thomas said: 'These two defendants . were involved in the business of recruiting and running labourers to . carry out block paving and tarmacking work on driveways. 'Their two victims, to whom the charges relate, make it clear John was the main boss but William was with him all the time. Two travellers who housed vulnerable men in squalid conditions, beat them and made them work for up to 80 hours a week were today jailed at Southampton Crown Court, pictured . 'The defendants recruited these two . men, who were vulnerable to exploitation due to their lifestyle and . circumstances at the time. 'They were socially isolated because . both had had relationships that had broken down and were no longer in . contact with those that were around them. 'The defendants took advantage of this and they were effectively forced to carry out work for the defendants’ benefit. 'They were exploited for the financial . gain of the defendants and paid little or no wages for the long hours . they were required to work. 'The defendants retained the profits . that were there to be made and John Connors owned an Audi convertible . car, thought to be worth around £45,000. 'The quality of the cars enjoyed by the defendants was no doubt one of the ways that the profits made by the victims was spent.' The men were finally rescued when one worker, Victor Romain, 55, broke his silence during a meeting with his probation worker. He fell into the Connors’ grasp in December 2010 after becoming homeless and estranged from his wife. Mr Romain said he was punched in the . head and hit with a shovel by John Connors after he lost £20 for fuel, . the court heard. His passport and wallet were also taken. He led police to the men after his probation officer alerted them to his plight. Mr Thomas said Mr Groombridge had been . tracked down when he left because of his treatment and he was . threatened with a beating and told he must work off a debt. He was also forced to fight three rounds with another man and felt he could not refuse. Mr Thomas said this was an example of the 'coercion, control and intimidation' the Connors had over the men. Mr Groombridge also told police he was 'worked and ate like a horse' and was taken to a tattoo parlour to have . a tattoo of a Ferrari horse on his back. Hamble in Hampshire, a well known yachting haven, where the travellers had a 'campsite' in a car park on a trading estate . Police launched a surveillance . operation on the travellers’ latest 'campsite', which was a car park on a . trading estate in the yachting haven of Hamble, Hampshire. There officers observed the way the workers were treated and decided to raid the site, which had 17 caravans, on June 24, 2011. When police raided the camp . the men were living in tents with no running water and had to use the . woods to go to the toilet. Meanwhile, the defendants were living . in luxury caravans with John Connors owning a convertible car worth . £45,000. They were able to identify another . victim - Christopher Groombridge, 31, - who also told of his ordeal at . the hands of his bosses from February 2011. Both told police they were paid in tobacco, alcohol and food. John Connors, from Leighton Buzzard, and William Connors, from Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, gave no comment in police interview. They went on trial last year accused . of four charges of holding another person in slavery or servitude but . the case was abandoned halfway through. They were due to face a retrial today . but each admitted two counts of a lesser charge of requiring another . person to perform forced or compulsory labour. Michael Epstine, defending John . Connors, said: 'The victims were given a roof over their head and a bed . to sleep in rather than a concrete floor or gutter.' Barry Gilbert, defending William . Connors, said: 'He was a lieutenant type figure, whose matter in this . affair was rather limited.' Judge Peter Henry sentenced a . tearful John Connors to 40 months imprisonment concurrent for each . charge and William Connors to 30 months concurrent for each charge. He said: 'Enforced labour is work or . services which are extracted from a person under the menace of penalty . and for which the said person has not offered themselve voluntarily. 'This was a serious offence the exploitation of vulnerable men in such a way that is abhorrent in a civilised society. 'When people have lost their pride and . hope, they are likely to become pathetically reliant on anybody that . offers them any sort of scraps. 'I’m satisfied the reason these two . men stayed and did not make further efforts to get away was because they . had that pathetic gratefulness for the things they were given. 'Vulnerable people have to be safeguarded.' Some men working for the Connors said they were happy with their lot, the court heard. Sentencing the pair, Judge Peter Henry said the men were vulnerable, had been exploited and humiliated and lived in squalor. 'You both earned considerable money by employing - and I use the word loosely - men to do hard manual labour for you. You had a good and comfortable standard of living.' The judge dismissed any suggestion the pair had been helping the men. 'It was exploitation of vulnerable men that is abhorrent in a civilised society,' he said. 'When people have lost their dignity and hope they are likely to be pathetically reliant on those who offer them scraps.'","Travellers housed vulnerable men in squalid conditions and exploited them .

A woman killed after a speeding rally car careered off a forest track into a crowd of spectators has been named this evening by police. Joy Robson, 50, is believed to be a nursery teacher from Portree, which is on the Isle of Skye. She was killed this morning after the vehicle lost control on a hairpin . bend and flipped over, before crashing into a tree and landing on top of her. It also hit an eight-year-old boy, who was taken to hospital with injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening.

Tragic: Joy Robson was killed after a rally car careered off course, flipped and landed on top of her . Tragic: A woman has been killed and an eight year-old boy injured when a speeding rally car careered off a forest track into a crowd of spectators. This picture shows emergency workers at the scene shortly after the incident . Accident: The tragedy happened during the first stage of the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally, a high-profile annual cross-country event, which took place despite muddy and slippery conditions . The young boy - understood to not be related - and Ms Robson were pinned under the yellow Honda Civic and around 20 distraught spectators rushed to lift the vehicle off them. Northern Constabularly later confirmed Ms Robson had died as a result of her injuries and the injured boy was in Raigmore Hospital, where his condition was not thought to be life-threatening. A third spectator suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision and has been described as police as 'walking wounded'. Neither the driver, who is believed to be Graeme Schoneville - a leading 1600cc competitor from Lanarkshire - nor  his co-driver were injured in the accident, which happened at around 10.30am. It took place six miles in to the opening leg of the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally at Balnain in Glen Urquhart Forest, about five miles west of Loch Ness. The horrifying incident was witnessed by dozens of spectators there for the rally, which started in 1955 and is run by the Highland Car Club. It covers 44 miles with cars racing against the clock on rough tracks through forests. Investigation: These local TV images show the rally car involved in the crash being taken away from the scene . Around 20,000 spectators usually turn out to watch the various legs of the race, which was abandoned after the horrific accident. Speaking this evening, one witness, Kyle Reid, a 21-year-old rally enthusiast from Inverness, revealed he was just yards away when the horror unfolded. He explained: ‘We were standing near a fast corner leading into a hairpin when we saw this yellow Honda Civic come round the bend. It must have been slippy at that part because most of the cars were sliding off it down into the hairpin. ‘We think it must have hit something because it tipped over onto its side and careered into a tree where there was a man with his two kids and an older woman standing. ‘The car wiped out the tree, one minute it was there, the next it was gone and the impact must have righted the car. But the woman and the little boy were trapped underneath. ‘There was loads of screaming and we rushed over to the scene with around 20 other spectators to lift the car off the woman and the wee boy. ‘It all happened in seconds and with so many people it didn’t take long for us to get the car off them. Both were conscious at the time. We spoke to the boy’s father, who was also there with his daughter, and he said they had all stood behind the tree because they thought it was safer. Horrifying: The incident was witnessed by dozens of spectators. The car involved is seen on the back of this van covered up . ‘I don’t know the people so I have no . idea if they are local. The woman had been trapped under the driver’s . wheel and was lying in the recovery permission until the ambulance staff . arrived. ‘She was complaining of a sore back and side and when the paramedics they strapped her to a board before they moved her. ‘The little boy was carried to a nearby Jeep with a flat bed where he waited for the ambulance men. We all got a shock. It is rare for accidents like this to happen and we are all desperately sorry for the woman’s family. Hopefully the little boy will be okay.’ One driver added: ‘I’ve been competing in the Snowman for a number of years, but the crowds in the opening stage today were bigger than I ever remember. ‘Because of the number of people watching, there was just no margin for error for the drivers. Probe: A vehicle is taken away from the scene of the accident following the crash. It is not known if this is the car which was involved .

"By . Craig Mackenzie . UPDATED: . 12:13 EST, 17 September 2011 . Boastful: Silvio Berlusconi was heard claiming he had bedded eight girls in one night . A lurid picture of Silvio Berlusconi's debauchery emerged today after he was heard boasting in bugged telephone calls of his sexual prowess and a preference for girls smaller than him. The Italian Prime Minister was taped talking to a businessman who is charged with recruiting female escorts for his famous 'Bunga Bunga' sex parties at his mansion. Berlusconi, who is 5 feet 5 inches tall, is heard asking Gianpaolo Tarantini 'not to bring tall [girls], as we are not tall.' In another conversation, he boasts to 'having been with eight [girls] in one night, even though I could have had eleven.' At one point, he reveals that there . are 40 women staying in his house who just won't leave. In many others, . he asks excitedly who the businessman will bring him next. The transcript of the calls between . Berlusconi and Tarantini are part of an investigation by magistrates looking . into the alleged prostitution ring surrounding Berlusconi. In one of the calls Berlusconi jokingly promises to act as 'prime minister in his spare time.' Most of wiretaps reveal inappropriate behaviour more suited to an over-excited teenager than a 74-year old leader of the third biggest country in Europe, according to MSNBC. They led to the arrest of Tarantini, among others, on charges of aiding and abetting prostitution. The investigation in the southern city of Bari, where Tarantini was based, includes about 100,000 wiretapped conversations, targeting eight people, including Tarantini, his brother and a woman nicknamed in the Italian media as 'Queen Bee' for her alleged role in recruiting women for the premier. These women included high-class escorts, such as Patrizia D'Addario, the woman whose revelation that she spent the night with Berlusconi when Barack Obama was elected U.S. President exposed the premier's sex scandals. They also included some minor starlets and would-be starlets. PM's party pals: High-class escort Patrizia D'Addario who says she spent the night with Burlesconi when Obama was elected  U.S. president and Noemi Letizia who celebrated her 18th birthday with the Italian leader . Tarantini 'persuaded them to prostitute themselves, or strengthened their initial resolve to prostitute themselves, during gatherings he organized at Silvio Berlusconi's residences,' said the document, obtained by Associated Press. Prosecutors claim that between September 2008 and May 2009 Tarantini recruited women of 'young age, slender frame,' and told them what to wear and how to behave at the parties. Wife Veronica Lario: She accused her husband of 'cavorting with minors' The telephone calls also raise fresh claims of Berlusconi’s abuse of office after he allowed Tarantini and a number of female 'friends' to use a presidential plane to join him while on an official trip to Milan. The list of women mentioned in the telephone calls, most of whom attended the parties, is a Who's Who in the Italian entertainment business. MSNBC said actresses, television starlets, aspiring weather-girls and glamour models have all gravitated to the prime minister in a system of apparently shameless patronage in exchange of sexual favours. In one of the calls, Berlusconi tells Tarantini, who agreed to bring five girls with him for dinner in one of the prime minister's residences, that he would invite the president of his film distribution company and a director of RAI, Italy's state channel, so that 'the girls feel there's someone there who have the power to give them work.' Tarantini has admitted paying scores of beautiful women to attend the prime minister's parties at his various mansions, but always denied Berlusconi knew they were sex workers, claiming he believed they were 'just friends.' Magistrates in Naples are also looking into regular payments that Berlusconi made to Tarantini, amounting to up to $1 million. Investigators believe they were part of an extortion plan by the businessman in exchange of his silence. But Berlusconi claims he gave the money to Tarantini to help 'a family in need.' While officially the prime minister is the victim of the alleged blackmailing, he believes the magistrates are in fact out to get him, and has so far declined the offer to provide testimony. On September 13, the day he was scheduled to meet the magistrates, he flew to Brussels for last-minute talks with European leaders over the financial crisis, prompting accusations he was  using Italy's economy downfall to escape justice. The magistrates have now given him a deadline until tomorrow to give his testimony. Should he fail to meet them, they said they will ask parliament for permission to have him brought to them by force - via police escort. Berlusconi is already on trial in four separate cases in Milan on charges of corruption, tax fraud and paying for sex with a minor.","Italian PM exposed by taped telephone conversations between him and businessmen who recruited girls .

The Ministry of Defence was yesterday forced to reset the user names and computer passwords of dozens of RAF staff following an embarrassing security blunder over pictures of Prince William. Ten photographs of the future king in his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot were published by St James’s Palace yesterday on the Duke’s website before being cleared by the MoD. The pictures, taken by an RAF photographer, had been intended to show off a ‘day in the life’ of the prince on base as Flight Lieutenant Wales at RAF Valley on Anglesey, north Wales. Blunder: The shots of the Duke of Cambridge at RAF Valley were re-released after being pulled when officials realised sensitive information was visible on computer screens in the background . 'Administrative oversight': The MoD was forced to reset some computer usernames and passwords following the mistake . The withdrawn pictures were re-released after sensitive information on computer screens visible in the background had been pixelated . They were considered something of a coup for his new website, www.dukeandduchessofcambridge.org. But the publicity exercise back-fired within hours as it emerged that sensitive information was visible in four of the shots. In one, William is in a briefing room in front of a computer with a password prompt screen open. Another shows a document on the desk . and an email open on a computer. Other photographs show details of . passwords and user names pinned up on a wall. Despite being second in line to the throne, Prince William is happy to do a tea round for his RAF colleagues . The Duke of Cambridge has a tiny bedroom like any other officer and he even has to make the bed, pictured . A day in the life: The Duke of Cambridge pictured during an aircraft check whilst working as a helicopter search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, Wales . 'Day in the life': The pictures were released to give a glimpse into the Duke of Cambridge's work as a search and rescue helicopter pilot . By the time horrified defence . officials spotted the mistake – some four hours after publication online . – the shots had appeared on websites around the world, on TV and in . newspapers including the Evening Standard in London. They were ‘re-released’ with the . details pixellated, but the MoD had no choice but to reset passwords of . some personnel ‘as a precaution’. It said: ‘Due to an administrative . oversight, these photographs were not properly cleared at RAF Valley. They have now been amended.’ St James’s Palace said: ‘The pictures were taken by an RAF photographer and any security issues are a matter for the MoD.’ The amended photos, which capture the prince's normal working day, show that while the Duke of Cambridge may be second in line to the throne, as a working member of the RAF Prince William clearly doesn’t stand on ceremony. The photographs of Prince William on duty at RAF Valley were published on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new official website, which was unveiled as the couple prepare to create their own court at Kensington Palace. The establishment of the Household Office of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is being viewed as a sign William is preparing to leave his role as a search and rescue helicopter pilot to embark on a life of Royal duty with wife Kate. The couple's official activities, including the new website, are being funded by Prince Charles using his income from the Duchy of Cornwall, his private estate. As Flight Lieutenant Wales of the . Search and Rescue (SAR) unit based at RAF Valley on Anglesey, north . Wales, William is happy to brew up a pot of tea and make his own bed. Whether taking the controls of his Sea . King helicopter or enjoying a plate of pasta and a laugh with his . crewmates, it is clear that the prince loves his ‘normal’ life in the . forces. Although he shares a rented farmhouse . with his wife, Kate, when on round-the-clock duty William stays in staff . accommodation on base. His tiny bedroom is just like that of . any officer – containing a chair, desk and single bed, which he has to . make himself in the morning. William, 30, can also be seen using . the base’s tiny kitchen to make a cup of tea as he and his colleagues . make up their flight plans and wait for their next ‘shout’. The prince’s working day begins with a . briefing from the off-going SAR crew about the state of their aircraft . and weather conditions. As his crew need to be airborne within . 15 minutes of receiving a call-out from the moment they go on duty, . such briefings are a hugely important part of their shift. According to the website, the future . king often likes to while away the hours waiting for his next emergency . call by playing video games, particularly Call Of Duty or other . military-themed games. Enjoying a meal with his RAF colleagues: Prince William wearing his green uniform tucks into his dinner . Flight Lieutenant Wales sits back in a comfy arm chair and relaxes during 'downtime' However as SAR crews are, like many in . the forces, expected to fly into conditions from which others are . fleeing, much of their day is spent honing and maintaining their flying . skills. William has been based at RAF Valley since 2010. He qualified as a helicopter captain in June and now leads a four-man crew. Valley is renowned for covering some . of the most varied and challenging terrain in the UK, involving both sea . and mountain rescues. On duty he works a 24-hour shift at the base and must never be more than 60 seconds from his machine, ready to be airborne. Flt. Lt. Wales carries out pre-flight checks in a Sea King helicopter during his working day .

Sir Jimmy Savile was labelled ‘one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time’ last night as police prepared to arrest his suspected accomplices. Surviving celebrities and former BBC staff linked to the entertainer will be questioned. Police now believe more than 200 people may have fallen victim to the Top of the Pops presenter and other predators. Scroll down for video . Criminal investigation: Scotland Yard has identified more than 200 potential victims of shamed Top of the Pops star Jimmy Savile . Involved? Claims have also emerged about fellow entertainer Gary Glitter - real name Paul Gadd . Detectives confirmed yesterday they have received growing evidence of rape and other sexual assaults by other alleged offenders that must be formally investigated. Those who face questioning may include disgraced pop star Gary Glitter. Another man facing arrest is one of Savile’s BBC staff who is accused of raping a former beauty queen and working as an accomplice for the Jim’ll Fix It star. The woman was 23 when she had consensual sex with Savile in his caravan in 1970 after writing to him asking for work experience. A week later she was invited back to the BBC by his colleague where he violently attacked her in a locked storeroom. The Met Police's criminal investigation into Savile's alleged child abuse centres around the shamed TV presenter. The . probe, called Operation Yewtree was launched today by Scotland Yard. Detectives have now established that those who were involved in or knew . about the alleged abuse include some 'living people that require formal . investigation'. Met Police . have refused to name those being investigated but a spokesman told . MailOnline they would include people who actively engaged in the alleged . abuse; people who facilitated or knew the alleged abuse was going on; . and people involved in any conspiracy to cover up the alleged abuse. The . investigation will look at the involvement of those who have since . died. They cannot be prosecuted but their alleged offences can be . investigated and used to bolster the investigation as a whole. The woman believes Savile conspired with her attacker to plan the assault. Yesterday the NSPCC said Savile is likely to be one of the most prolific sex offenders the charity has encountered. Commander Peter Spindler, who is leading the inquiry for Scotland Yard, said his team is now pursuing more than 400 leads passed to police over the past fortnight. He said: ‘What we have established in the last two weeks is that there are lines of inquiry involving living people. The public’s response to this issue has been astounding. We are dealing with alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale.’ A flood of calls to Scotland Yard and referrals from other forces has left senior officers shocked at the scale of Savile’s abuse. The entertainer died last year aged 84. Police chiefs have pledged to record the complaints of his victims and publish the results  of their review as soon as  next month. But yesterday they revealed for the first time that others in and around his celebrity circle face  investigation. It is understood that the vast majority of more than 200 potential victims accuse Savile of being their tormentor. But there are a small number of alleged attacks where victims have pointed the finger at others. Among them is believed to be Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, accused of raping a girl of 13 in Savile’s BBC dressing room. Separate and less serious allegations concern entertainer Freddie Starr. Starr, 69, yesterday again angrily denied claims he groped a 14-year-old girl after a Savile TV show. Convicted paedophile Jonathan King is also likely to be questioned as well as other ex-colleagues at Radio 1 and BBC TV. The fall-out from the Savile scandal continues to pile pressure on the BBC, three hospitals who hosted the star and some of his former colleagues. Scotland Yard gave the broadcaster the green light to begin a formal review in parallel to its criminal inquiry yesterday. Former High Court judge Dame Fiona Reynolds will examine whether the culture at the broadcaster enabled the abuse of children to ‘continue unchecked’. Two other reviews will examine why Newsnight dropped an investigation into Savile and claims of sexual harassment. A Department of Health investigation will also take place into Savile’s conduct at three hospitals – Stoke Mandeville, Broadmoor and Leeds General Infirmary. The BBC and others could face a huge compensation bill if it is found they were negligent. Peter Watt, of the NSPCC, said: ‘It’s now looking possible that Jimmy Savile was one of the most prolific sex offenders the NSPCC has ever come across. ‘We have received over 136 calls directly relating to allegations against him which we’ve passed to the police.’ A team of ten officers from the Met’s child abuse command are overseeing the inquiry, known as Operation Yewtree. The investigation into alleged child sex abuse by Jimmy Savile has been become a criminal investigation after Scotland Yard identified more than 200 potential victims of the shamed presenter. The Met had originally been conducting an 'assessment' into the claims against . Savile, but now it appears that the Top Of The Pops presenter is 'one of the most prolific sex offenders' Britain has ever seen, according to the NSPCC. But today Scotland Yard launched Operation Yewtree after detectives established that those who were involved in or knew about the alleged abuse include some 'living people that require formal investigation'. Victim: Kevin Cook, (circled) Savile's youngest alleged victim, claims he was lured to a dressing room with the promise of receiving a Jim'll Fix It badge after appearing on the programme in 1976 when he was nine . Claims: Caroline Moore, left, claims she was a wheelchair-bound 13-year-old recovering from an operation to fuse her spine when Savile abused her during a visit to Stoke Mandeville hospital, while right Savile is snapped with another patient from the infirmary .

'Recent tracks from jeep tires in the snow were disappearing under the lava - but because it was moving so slow we were not actually noticing any movements.

A council has defended its decision to sell the birthplace of former prime minister Sir Anthony Eden for a bargain price. Windlestone Hall, set in 25 acres of parkland and boasting its own clock tower, stables and servants’ quarters, was expected to attract offers of more than £2million. But six years after it first went on the market it has been sold for £241,000 - a fraction of its original valuation. Piece of history: Windlestone Hall is thought to have been valued at nearly £2million just a few years ago . Sign of distinction: The 19th-century clocktower would have been in place when former Prime Minister Anthony Eden was born here . Deserted for years: The house has not been used since 2003, when a local authority school moved out because it needed major repairs . Elegant decor: One of several ornate ceilings within the beautiful building . In 2010, English Heritage refused the proposals by a developer who wanted to build luxury homes on the site . Opulent fashion: Classical mouldings shaped like swirling leaves and baskets of flowers decorate walls and ceilings throughout the mansion . The grade-II listed property, sold by the Eden family in the 1920s, was once a school and a former POW camp during the war, but had been empty since 2006. Stuart Timmiss, head of assets at Durham Council, said: 'Given the condition of the building the state of the market and the very significant maintenance costs....the sale did represent best value for money for taxpayers.' A councillor had reported the sale to the Audit Commission whose investigation highlighted a lack of transparency in selling the property after a £1.5 million deal collapsed. Its new owners, who have chosen to remain anonymous, vowed: ‘It is a private home which is going to be renovated back to its original splendour.’ The charming house features grand staircases, Doric order columns and 12 bay windows at the front . Generations of happy families: Hall as viewed from the former pleasure gardens with the clocktower in the background . The Hall has a billiard room, a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery and a drawing room . Affluent past: Staff quarters and a stable are situated in the extensive grounds . Born at the hall: Anthony Eden was born at Windlestone in 1897, before going on to become Conservative Prime Minister in the fifties . The picturesque home, located . near the County Durham village of Rushyford, is said to need urgent . repairs costing an estimated £3million . County Councillor John Shuttleworth insisted the council had sold the property too cheaply. He said: ‘The property was on the market for a figure approaching £2million in 2007. ‘The council was offered £1.5million in the same year, but they turned this offer down. It is a massive, massive property, with ornate period features. ‘Even in today’s climate the land itself should be worth at least £4,000 an acre making the parkland alone worth £100,000. I think the sale for this price is totally wrong.’ The 19th century hall was first built in 1835, incorporating a section of the rear wing which dated back to 1750. Designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi and built for Robert Thompson Eden, the property was the 1897 birthplace of the former Tory prime minister Sir Anthony Eden who led the country between 1955 and 1957. In 2006 Durham County Council, faced . with an £81,000 annual bill to maintain the hall, decided to sell up to a . property developer who planned to turn the hall into luxury flats. 'As the hall is a grade II listed building, we were obliged by law to protect and maintain it while it was under our ownership. However, the proposals were  rejected by English Heritage. Gorgeous setting: Windlestone lies within 25 acres of lush parkland . Grand interior: The hall boasts a library with dummy bookshelf, many original staircases and fireplaces - but needs major repairs . Upstairs downstairs: The northern elevation of the former staff accommodation . Glorious countryside: An earlier prospective buyer wanted to build luxury flats on the site - but the new owners intend to restore the home to its former splendour . Enduring designs: Map showing the listed buildings in and around the 19th-century home . After the deal fell through the council began looking at alternative options when it received an expression of interest which finally led to its sale. The U-shaped home has a billiard room, a library with a dummy bookcase leading to its gallery, stables, separate staff quarters and many original marble fireplaces. A spokesman for English Heritage said it was of the ‘most historically significant buildings in the North East’, adding: ‘We are pleased new owners have been found and look forward to working with them and the council.’ From Baronets to blackboards: An extension was added on to Windlestone when parts of it became a school between 1957 and 2003 . Windlestone Hall was built in 1835 and instantly became one of the region's grandest stately homes. It was commissioned by Baronet Robert Johnson . Eden, to replace his 16th-century manor, and designed by architect Ignatius Bonomi. On . the death of the fifth Baronet in 1844, the estate and Baronetcy passed . to his cousin, Sir William Eden, the fourth Eden of Maryland Baronet, who became High Sheriff of Durham in 1848. Anthony Eden was born there in 1897 and later served as a cabinet minister before becoming prime minister from 1955 to 1957. The estate was then used as a prisoner of war camp for female German prisoners during the Second World War. Afterwards it was adapted by the council to serve as a school for youngsters with emotional and behavioural difficulties for nearly 50 years, between 1957 and 2006. Windlestone Hall School added an unlisted extension to the building in the seventies, but was forced to relocate several years ago after the hall fell into disrepair. A buyer then became interested in developing the land for luxury flats, but the deal fell through and the house has only now been sold to an unnamed buyer, who plans to restore it to its former splendour.","The 25-acre grounds contain stables, a clock tower and staff quarters and was expected to attract offers of more than £2 million .

A team of astronomers used Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope to clock the expansion of the cosmos at a phenomenal 46 miles per second per megaparsec. American astronomer Edwin Hubble was in the Twenties first to discover that space is constantly expanding and has been growing continuously since its inception. Nasa's Spitzer Space Telescope seen against the infrared sky: The orbital instrument has been used to give the most accurate estimate yet of the rate at which the cosmos is expanding . Astronomers now believe that the universe exploded into being about about 13.7billion years ago, so determining the rate of the continuing expansion, known as Hubble's constant, is critical for gauging its age and size. Spitzer's new measurement, which took advantage of long-wavelength infrared instead of visible light, improves upon a similar, seminal study from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope by a factor of three, bringing the uncertainty down to only 3 percent, a giant leap in accuracy for a cosmological measurement. The newly refined value, in astronomer-speak, is: 74.3 ± 2.1 kilometres per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is roughly 3million light-years). 'Spitzer is yet again doing science it wasn't designed to do,' said Michael Werner, the mission's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'First, it surprised us with its pioneering ability to study exoplanet atmospheres, and now, in the mission's later years, it's become a valuable cosmology tool.' To work out the speed the universe is expanding, astronomers observe variable stars called Cepheids, which are good distance indicators because their intrinsic brightness can be calculated by their pulsing light. If their intrinsic brightness is known, their distance can be estimated by comparing that with their apparent brightness, since the further away they are, the more their light dims. Glenn Wahlgren, Spitzer program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington, told Fox News: 'These pulsating stars are vital rungs in what astronomers call the cosmic distance ladder: a set of objects with known distances that, when combined with the speeds at which the objects are moving away from us, reveal the expansion rate of the universe.' The findings were combined with published data from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe to obtain an independent measurement of dark energy, one of the greatest mysteries of our cosmos. In the late Nineties, astronomers were shocked to learn that the expansion of our universe is actually speeding up over time. In an effort to understand how the cosmos was overcoming the force of gravity, scientists theorised that there must be this dark energy pulling the fabric of the universe apart. 'This is a huge puzzle,' said Wendy Freedman, director of the Carnegie Observatories, who led the latest research. 'It's exciting that we were able to use Spitzer to tackle fundamental problems in cosmology: the precise rate at which the universe is expanding at the current time, as well as measuring the amount of dark energy in the universe from another angle.' Spitzer was able to improve upon past measurements of Hubble's constant due to its infrared vision, which sees through dust to provide better views of variable stars called Cepheids. These pulsating stars are vital 'rungs' in what astronomers called the cosmic distant ladder: a set of objects with known distances that, when combined with the speeds at which the objects are moving away from us, reveal the expansion rate of the universe. The 'cosmic ladder': NASA's Spitzer Space . Telescope has greatly improved on past measurements of Hubble's constant . due to its infrared vision which sees through dust to provide better . views of stars called Cepheids . Cepheids are crucial to these . calculations because their distances from Earth can be readily measured. In 1908, Henrietta Leavitt discovered that these stars pulse at a rate . that is directly related to their intrinsic brightness. To . visualize why this is important, imagine somebody walking away from you . while carrying a candle. The candle would dim the farther it travelled, . and its apparent brightness would reveal just how far. The same principle applies to Cepheids, standard candles in our cosmos. By measuring how bright they appear on the sky, and comparing this to their known brightness as if they were close up, astronomers can calculate their distance from Earth. Spitzer observed ten Cepheids in our own Milky Way galaxy and 80 in a nearby neighbouring galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud. Without the cosmic dust blocking their view at the infrared wavelengths, the research team was able to obtain more precise measurements of the stars' apparent brightness, and thus their distances, than previous studies had done. With these data, the researchers could then tighten up the rungs on the cosmic distant ladder, opening the way for a new and improved estimate of our universe's expansion rate. 'Just over a decade ago, using the words ""precision"" and ""cosmology"" in the same sentence was not possible, and the size and age of the universe was not known to better than a factor of two,' Ms Freedman said. 'Now we are talking about accuracies of a few percent. It is quite extraordinary.' The findings will be published in the Astrophysical Journal.","The rate of expansion of the cosmos, known as Hubble's constant, is crucial for working out its age and size .

Jessica Meecham, 20, is facing jail after admitting calling police to report a theft while drunk outside a pub then attacking officers when they arrived . A drunk woman growled at a police car and then attacked two officers after calling them to report a theft from outside a pub, a court heard today. Jessica Meechan, 20, was on a night out at The Coach House in Bristol when a fight broke out. When police arrived Meechan charged at the window of their unmarked vehicle and began growling. She was then arrested and assaulted two officers - spitting in the face of a WPC and pinching the thigh of her male colleague. Meechan admitted two charges of assaulting a police officer and one of being drunk and disorderly. District judge Simon Cooper adjourned the hearing at Bristol Magistrates’ Court for a pre-sentence report - but warned Meechan she faced prison. He told her: 'The purpose of this sentence will be punishment. You need to be taught a lesson.' Prosecuting, Chris Holland said the officers were called to the Coach House pub on Stapleton Road after reports of a fight. He said: 'On arrival the defendant was located outside the premises. The defendant proceeded to charge at the window of an unmarked police vehicle and growl. 'She was making threats about an unnamed person, saying 'I am going to stab her up, I will kill her next time'. 'She was behaving in a volatile manner.' Mr Holland said PC Gethin and WPC Pendleton arrested Meechan after arriving at the pub at 2.30am on October 25 last year. Meechan spat in the face of WPC Pendleton and then pinched the thigh of PC Gethin before being taken to a nearby police station. Police were called to The Coach House pub in Bristol where they were attacked by Meechan . When interviewed Meechan claimed she had been beaten by two girls in the pub's toilet who stole her mobile phone and £45. She said she was then thrown out of the pub by the landlord and that she had called police to investigate the theft. Graham Arnall, defending, said Meechan, of Easton, Bristol, had been injured in the attack by the girls. He said: 'She had black eyes, cuts and swelling to her face consistent with punches. 'She wanted the police to help her.' The court heard that Meechan has four previous convictions for assaulting police officers, two for battery and a number of drunk and disorderly offences.","Jessica Meechan, 20, charged at unmarked car and started growling .

In 2000, Detroit was the 10th largest city in the U.S., with a population of 1.8million. Today that figure stands at 700,000, and empty streets lined with vacant and abandoned homes serve as a glaring reminder of the painful decline the once-thriving city has witnessed over the intervening years. Now a $1billion investment project that aims to transform Detroit's downtown area into a vibrant urban core is among efforts to revive the recession-hit city's flagging fortunes and restore it to its former glory.

Despite Mr Gilbert's investment in . and vision for Detroit, not everybody in the city is entirely supportive . of his regeneration plan. Some . critics have suggested the redevelopment of the downtown area - which . is home to a largely white population and generally wealthier than .

'There is clearly a plan to invest in the downtown area, but . there has been no urban reinvestment in poor black neighborhoods.' 'We're focused on downtown - that's where we can make a difference,' Mr Gilbert has said. While . the redevelopment is creating security jobs and other menial posts in . the downtown area, the city's Mayor Dave Bing has said Detroit needs . investment in retraining and educating workers who in the past held . automotive or manufacturing jobs. But . Mr Bing, who has slashed public spending in a bid to avert the state's . takeover of the city's finances, nonetheless welcomes Quicken Loans' investment in the city. 'Downtown is coming back very strong, and that has been driven by the private sector,' he said. Vision: Several buildings in downtown Detroit have been snapped up by Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert, who wants to halt the exodus of graduates from recession-hit Michigan . Magnet: Mr Gilbert is hoping downtown Detroit will become a hub that will encourage graduates to stay in their home city and set up their businesses .

There goes the neighbourhood: Ruth Mucha, 81, stands on her front porch as a work crew tears down the vacant property next to hers, which had been frequented by squatters and drug addicts . Abandoned: Detroit has sought ways to restore to its former glory a once vibrant city that boasted the 10th largest population in the United States . The mayor has launched Detroit Future City, a planning blueprint that aims to revamp the city's economy and utilise empty space, making less populated neighbourhoods viable and repurposing land. Sarah Brithinee, 26, is one young entrepreneur who now sees a 'land of opportunity' in her hometown. Ms Brithinee, who returned to the city from Los Angeles in 2011, is chief executive of Wedit, which rents out digital cameras for wedding parties, then edits the footage into commemorative videos. 'I feel for the first time in my life I am making a real difference by coming back to Detroit,' she said.

Positive: Detroit's mayor has welcomed the efforts of Quicken Loans and other investment from the private sector . Mr Gilbert's father and grandfather both owned businesses in Detroit before much of the city's white population began moving to the suburbs 80 years ago, where there were federal subsidies for land. That exodus accelerated after race riots in 1943 and 1968 and was compounded by the slow decline of automotive jobs. On the walls of some of the office space Quicken has taken over in Detroit there are giant black and white reproductions of photos of the city in all its glory, a hustling, bustling city with a dynamic core. For Elizabeth Rose those images are part of her childhood in the 1960s when her father worked as a mortgage banker in the First National Building downtown, a building Quicken Loans now owns. Ms Rose runs the first branch of coffee emporium Roasting Plant outside New York on the ground floor. 'For me, coming back was all about Quicken Loans and the commitment they have made to Detroit,"" Rose said.
